25|$|There are depletion-mode MOSFET devices, {{which are}} less {{commonly}} used {{than the standard}} enhancement-mode devices already described. These are MOSFET devices that are doped so that a channel exists even with zero voltage from gate to source. To control the channel, a negative voltage {{is applied to the}} gate (for an n-channel device), depleting the channel, which reduces the current flow through the device. In essence, the depletion-mode device is equivalent to a normally closed (<b>on)</b> <b>switch,</b> while the enhancement-mode device is equivalent to a normally open (off) switch. Due to their low noise figure in the RF region, and better gain, these devices are often preferred to bipolars in RF front-ends such as in TV sets. Depletion-mode MOSFET families include BF960 by Siemens and Telefunken, and the BF980 in the 1980s by Philips (later to become NXP Semiconductors), whose derivatives are still used in AGC and RF mixer front-ends.|$|E

2500|$|After Airport 1975, Harrison guest-starred {{on several}} TV shows. As [...] "Augusta Summerland", she {{appeared}} on Barnaby Jones in episode #67 [...] "The Alpha-Bravo War" [...] (air date: October 24, 1975); <b>on</b> <b>Switch</b> in episode #24 [...] "Death Squad" [...] (air date: April 6, 1976); {{and again on}} Barnaby Jones in episode #114 [...] "The Damocles Gun" [...] (air date: October 20, 1977). In the 1980s, Harrison resumed studying acting and enrolled in an acting school. When the school held a showcase presentation of its students' work, Harrison invited her by-then ex-husband and his third wife, Lili Fini Zanuck. The Zanucks needed a middle-aged actress to play Barrett Oliver's mother in their upcoming production of Cocoon; after viewing Harrison's scenes, they told her {{there might be a}} part for her. [...] "So I had an interview with Ron Howard and he said 'You got the part.'" [...] Harrison reprised her role as Susan in the 1988 sequel, , which failed to achieve the commercial and critical success of its predecessor.|$|E
60|$|The {{run of the}} Accelerated was at {{that time}} {{regarded}} as a national exploit, forming, as it did, part of a new link binding Japan and London--the East and the West; and I knew the conductor would hardly have waited for one of his own directors. The white streak rapidly grew larger; something sparkled beneath it, and there was flash of twinkling glass through the dust and steam. I fixed my eyes on the station, and taxed every aching sinew in hand and heel, for the weakening beast must bring me there in time or die. A smoke cloud, with bright patches beneath it, rolled up to the station when I was nearly half a mile away. The horse was reeling under me, the power had gone out of the leaden hands <b>on</b> <b>switch</b> and bridle, and--for the tension had produced a vertigo--my sight was almost gone.|$|E
6000|$|The Mpongwe {{settlements}} on the Gaboon River are neatly built, {{but without}} any attempt at fortification; {{for the most part}} each contains one family, or rather a chief and his dependants. In the larger plantation [...] "towns," [...] the abodes form a single street, ranging from 100 to 1,000 yards in length; sometimes, but rarely, there are cross streets; the direction is made to front the sea- breeze, and, if possible, to present a corner to storm-bearing Eurus. An invariable feature, like the arcaded loggie of old Venetian towns, is the Námpolo, or palaver-house, which may be described as the club-room of the village. An open hangar, like the Ikongolo or [...] "cask-house" [...] of the trading places, it is known by a fire always kept burning. The houses are cubes, or oblong squares, varying from 10 to 100 feet in length, according to the wealth and dignity of the owner; all are one-storied, and a few are raised <b>on</b> <b>switch</b> foundations. Most of them have a verandah facing the street, and a [...] "compound" [...] or cleared space in the rear for cooking and other domestic purposes. The walls are built by planting double and parallel rows of posts, the material being either bamboo or the mid-rib of a wine-giving palm (Raphia vinifera); to these uprights horizontal slats of cane are neatly lashed by means of the never-failing [...] "tie-tie," [...] bast-slips, runners, or llianas. For the more solid buildings thin [...] "Mpávo," [...] or bark slabs, are fitted in between the double posts; when coolness is required, their place is taken by mats woven with the pinnated leaves of sundry palms. This is a favourite industry with the women, who make two kinds, one coarse, the other a neat and close article, of rattan-tint until it becomes smoke-stained: the material is so cheap and comfortable, that many of the missionaries prefer it for walls to brick or boarding. The windows are mere holes in the mats to admit light, and the doors are cut with a Mpáno (adze) from a single tree trunk, which would be wilful waste if timber were ever wanting. The floor is sometimes sandy, but generally of hard and level tamped clay, to which the European would prefer boarding, and, as a rule, it is clean--no fear of pythogenie from here! The pent-shaped roof of rafters and thatch is water-tight except when the host of rats disturb it by their nocturnal gambols.|$|E
