40|$|Concerning {{in-vitro}} biological studies, it {{is necessary}} that a well-characterized <b>exposure</b> <b>system</b> is used particularly to validate and replicate key findings. Therefore, we improved and characterized an ELF magnetic field <b>exposure</b> <b>system</b> with high dynamic exposure range (µT–mT) and reduced stray magnetic fields for a 50 / 60 Hz sinusoidal signal. The basic design is based on a double solenoid setup. The outer solenoid is used for the reduction of the stray B-flux densities. The system itself is modular to adapt to different biological experiments. To be able to apply a high dynamic exposure range a controlled air cooling system is added. The <b>exposure</b> <b>system</b> is using a control algorithm and associated Graphical User Interface. Temperature is measured and controlled inside the exposure area.

Although various methods for this purpose exist, many of them are time consuming, require extensive instrumentation, or offer only limited ability to assess the performance of the system under experimental settings. We present the development and evaluation of a new, highly robust and sensitive fluorometry-based method for assessing the particle size specific delivery of liquid aerosols. Glycerol aerosols of different mean particle sizes and narrow size distributions, carrying the fluorophore disodium fluorescein, were generated in a condensation monodisperse aerosol generator.

40|$|OVERVIEW: While {{semiconductor}} manufacturers {{continue to}} express {{concerns about the}} limitations of photolithography, revolutions in lithographic techniques {{have led to the}} formation of patterns with dimensions smaller than the wavelength of the light source. Also, due to the increasing cost of <b>exposure</b> <b>systems,</b> equipment related to the lithography process is beginning to constitute the bulk of plant investment in the field of semiconductor manufacture. Meanwhile, there seems to be no end to the demands for fine gate lengths in logic devices such as MPUs (micro-processing units) and LSIs (large-scale integrations). Technical innovations are thus being made in fields such as lithography in an effort to meet these growing demands. Although gate lengths at the 90 nm node have already been developed, industry is now calling for a reduction to 70 nm or less. However, structures as small as this are difficult to form, even when using resolution enhancement technologies in conjunction with ArF excimer laser exposure techniques. To resolve this deadlock, Hitachi has developed and commercialized a slimming system, which can produce fine patterns below the resolution limit of <b>exposure</b> <b>systems</b> by precisely slimming a resist pattern formed by lithography. In combination with existing <b>exposure</b> <b>systems,</b> this slimming system can produce ultra-fine patterns that take the lead in next-generation <b>exposure</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

In this paper, we developed an <b>exposure</b> <b>system</b> using a figure- 8 loop antenna to permit localized exposure of a rat head to 1500 MHz microwave fields, simulating human head exposure to cellular phones. We have numerically estimated the specific absorption rate (SAR) in a rat exposed to microwave fields via our new <b>exposure</b> <b>system.</b> The high ratio of SAR averaged over the target tissue (i. e., the brain) to that averaged over the whole body suggests that the figure- 8 antenna can realize greater localized exposure than the previously used <b>exposure</b> <b>system.</b> We have also confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed system experimentally...|$|R
40|$|A mobile whole-body <b>exposure</b> <b>system</b> was {{developed}} for exposing mice to concentrated ambient particulate matter smaller than 2. 5 μm in mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD). Each 20 -L exposure cage was designed to hold 9 mice within individual compartments. This allowed for transport and subsequent exposure. Airflow mixing {{and the potential for}} stagnant areas within the compartments were modeled using computational fluid dynamic modeling (CFD). CFD analysis showed no stagnant areas and good mixing throughout the exposure cage. The actual performance of the <b>exposure</b> <b>system</b> was determined for 0. 5 to 2. 0 μm diameter aerosols by measuring (1) uniformity of aerosol distribution and (2) particle deposition in the tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions of mice exposed in the system. A 0. 6 -μm MMAD (GSD = 2. 0) cigarette smoke aerosol was used to experimentally measure the uniformity of aerosol distribution to the nine individual compartments. The average data from three runs showed no statistically significant difference among individual compartments. Particle deposition efficiency in adult mate BALB/c mice was measured after exposure (30 min) in the system using monodisperse fluorescent polystyrene latex particles (0. 5, 1, and 2 μm aerodynamic diameter). The measured deposition efficiency in this mobile <b>exposure</b> <b>system</b> for the combined tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions of the adult male BALB/c mice was 21 % for 0. 5 μm, 11 % for 1. 0 μm, and 6. 5 % for 2. 0 μm particles.

Light-, confocal microscopy, scanning- and transmission electron microscopy, transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurement and RT-PCR were performed to identify how the PBEC differentiated under ALI culture condition. Both models were exposed to palladium (Pd) nanoparticles which sized 6 - 10 nm, analogous to those released from modern car catalysts, at three different concentrations utilizing the XposeALI module of the PreciseInhale® <b>exposure</b> <b>system.</b> Exposing the 3 D models to Pd nanoparticles induced increased secretion of IL- 8, yet the chronic bronchitis-like model released significantly more IL- 8 than the normal model.

40|$|As CMOS {{technology}} pushes feature dimensions {{beyond the}} sub-wavelength threshold, {{the effect of}} lens aberrations in the imaging system becomes more relevant.

This experimental set up demonstrated high reproducibility and sensitivity for dosing control and distribution of particles. All exposure of cells to PBDE-bound particles significantly decreased cell viability and induced reactive oxygen species generation in A 549 and NCI-H 358 cells.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of engineered nanostructured materials into a rapidly {{increasing number of}} industrial and consumer products will result in enhanced exposure to engineered nanoparticles. Workplace exposure {{has been identified as}} the most likely source of uncontrolled inhalation of engineered aerosolized nanoparticles, but release of engineered nanoparticles may occur at any stage of the lifecycle of (consumer) products. The dynamic development of nanomaterials with possibly unknown toxicological effects poses a challenge for the assessment of nanoparticle induced toxicity and safety. In this consensus document from a workshop on in-vitro cell systems for nanoparticle toxicity testing 11 Workshop on 'In-Vitro Exposure Studies for Toxicity Testing of Engineered Nanoparticles' sponsored by the Association for Aerosol Research (GAeF), 5 - 6 September 2009, Karlsruhe, Germany. an overview is given of the main issues concerning exposure to airborne nanoparticles, lung physiology, biological mechanisms of (adverse) action, in-vitro cell <b>exposure</b> <b>systems,</b> realistic tissue doses, risk assessment and social aspects of nanotechnology. The workshop participants recognized the large potential of in-vitro cell <b>exposure</b> <b>systems</b> for reliable, high-throughput screening of nanoparticle toxicity. For the investigation of lung toxicity, a strong preference was expressed for air-liquid interface (ALI) cell <b>exposure</b> <b>systems</b> (rather than submerged cell <b>exposure</b> <b>systems)</b> as they more closely resemble in-vivo conditions in the lungs and they allow for unaltered and dosimetrically accurate delivery of aerosolized nanoparticles to the cells. An important aspect, which is frequently overlooked, is the comparison of typically used in-vitro dose levels with realistic in-vivo nanoparticle doses in the lung. If we consider average ambient urban exposure and occupational exposure at 5 mg/m 3 (maximum level allowed by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)) as the boundaries of human exposure, the corresponding upper-limit range of nanoparticle flux delivered to the lung tissue is 3 × 10 - 5 - 5 × 10 - 3 μg/h/cm 2 of lung tissue and 2 - 300 particles/h/(epithelial) cell. This range can be easily matched and even exceeded by almost all currently available cell <b>exposure</b> <b>systems.</b> The consensus statement includes a set of recommendations for conducting in-vitro cell exposure studies with pulmonary cell systems and identifies urgent needs for future development. As these issues are crucial for the {{introduction of}} safe nanomaterials into the marketplace and the living environment, they deserve more attention and more interaction between biologists and aerosol scientists. The members of the workshop believe that further advances in in-vitro cell exposure studies would be greatly facilitated by a more active role of the aerosol scientists.
