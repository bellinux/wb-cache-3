Thermosensitive PNIPAM (poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)) was then grafted <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>Of</b> SiO(2) /Fe(3) O(4) nanoparticles, generating thermosensitive and magnetic properties of nanocomposites. The sizes of fabricated nanoparticles with core-shell structure are controlled at about 30 nm and each nanoparticle contains only one monodisperse Fe(3) O(4) core. For thermosensitivity analysis, the phase transition temperatures of multifunctioral nanoparticles measured using DSC was at around 34 - 36 degrees C. The magnetic characteristics of these multifunctional nanoparticles were also superparamagnetic. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|At {{some point}} in the future, IK Pegasi A will consume the {{hydrogen}} fuel at its core and start to evolve away from the main sequence to form a red giant. The envelope of a red giant can grow to significant dimensions, extending up to a hundred times its previous radius (or larger). Once IK Pegasi A expands to the point where its outer envelope overflows the Roche lobe of its companion, a gaseous accretion disk will form around the white dwarf. This gas, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, will then accrete <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the companion. This mass transfer between the stars will also cause their mutual orbit to shrink.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 2004, the Cassini–Huygens {{space probe}} {{performed}} the SOI (Saturn Orbit Insertion) maneuver and entered orbit around Saturn. Before the SOI, Cassini had already studied the system extensively. In June 2004, it had conducted a close flyby of Phoebe, sending back high-resolution images and data. Cassini flyby of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, has captured radar images of large lakes and their coastlines with numerous islands and mountains. The orbiter completed two Titan flybys before releasing the Huygens probe on 25 December 2004. Huygens descended <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> Titan on 14 January 2005, sending {{a flood of}} data during the atmospheric descent and after the landing.

5|$|Females {{typically}} {{lay between}} {{four hundred and}} three thousand eggs. The eggs are often dropped <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the water; sometimes the female deposits them by dipping {{the tip of her}} abdomen into the water during flight, releasing a small batch of eggs each time, or deposits them in bulk while standing next to the water. In a few species, the female submerges and places the eggs among plants or in crevices underwater, but in general, they sink to the bottom. The incubation time is variable, depending at least in part on temperature, and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year. Eggs can go into a quiet dormant phase or diapause. The larval growth rate is also temperature-dependent, as is the number of moults. At anywhere between ten and fifty, these post-embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies than in most other insect orders. The nymphal stage of mayflies may last from several months to several years, depending on species and environmental conditions.|$|E

5|$|Only about 6% of {{the salt}} {{manufactured}} {{in the world is}} used in food. Of the remainder, 12% is used in water conditioning processes, 8% goes for de-icing highways and 6% is used in agriculture. The rest (68%) is used for manufacturing and other industrial processes, and sodium chloride {{is one of the largest}} inorganic raw materials used by volume. Its major chemical products are caustic soda and chlorine, which are separated by the electrolysis of a pure brine solution. These are used in the manufacture of PVC, plastics, paper pulp and many other inorganic and organic compounds. Salt is also used as a flux in the production of aluminium. For this purpose, a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants. It is also used in the manufacture of soaps and glycerine, where it is added to the vat to precipitate out the saponified products. As an emulsifier, salt is used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber, and another use is in the firing of pottery, when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the ceramic material, forming a strong glaze.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the U-boats in May 1943 did not signal {{the end of the}} Battle of the Atlantic. Some 60 vessels remained, and posed a threat to convoys. In later months, the Schnorchel, a device {{originated}} by the Dutch and later adopted by the Kriegsmarine after the Germans invaded the Netherlands were capable of allowing a U-boat to replace its air supply and vent its diesel exhaust without surfacing became available. However, it was sensitive to the weather, and put immense pressure and strain on crews who had to remain submerged for long period in hostile waters. Further, Coastal's Mark III radar could detect the mast. The smoke emitted was visible from 1,000 feet. In some cases the mast itself could be seen, some one foot in diameter, projecting two feet and moving at 12–15 knots. The technological response was to use High Tea, a series of sonobuoys dropped by aircraft <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the sea to detect U-boats. By late 1943, the U-bootwaffe was losing 20 percent of its strength per month. Some 70 percent that did return were seriously damaged.|$|E

The ζ-potential values determined by the EA technique were in excellent agreement with those determined by the ME technique.

The major advantage of the EA technique was that it could be carried out in situ without having to dilute the emulsions, so that the equilibrium between adsorbed and nonadsorbed polyelectrolyte was not disturbed by dilution. Nevertheless, the good agreement between the ζ-potential values determined by the EA and ME techniques suggested that emulsion dilution did not cause an appreciable change in polysaccharide partitioning for the system used in this study. In summary, the EA technique appears to be a powerful means of monitoring polyelectrolyte adsorption in concentrated colloidal dispersions...|$|R
