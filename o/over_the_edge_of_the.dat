5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper draped <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table is clearly visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E
5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters {{that use}} non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up where the next riders board.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Marge and Ruth again while cooking {{breakfast on}} his car engine, Wiggum {{continues}} his chase of the two, aided by other Springfield Police vehicles. After noticing a cliff ahead, Homer believes that Marge and Ruth are attempting suicide because of him and, using a megaphone, apologizes to Marge for all the mistakes he has made in their marriage and urges them not to drive into the chasm. Ruth, who had not noticed the chasm, slams on the brakes and stops in time; however, Homer and Wiggum fail to stop and fly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliff only to crash into a landfill. The episodes ends {{with a description of}} the fates of each of the characters involved in the episode.|$|E

5|$|On {{a trip to}} {{the bird}} sanctuary, the Simpson family discovers that a {{speedway}} raceway built around the sanctuary is opening that day, to Lisa's dismay. The family watches from the stand and sees Ned Flanders and his family, who claims to enjoy the high levels of safety the drivers use. Later, a squad of cheerleaders fires free T-shirts from air cannons into the crowd, and Homer rudely demands one. Irritated, Maude leaves to buy hot dogs. The cheerleaders send a full salvo of T-shirts in Homer's direction, but he bends down at the last second to pick up a bobby pin on the ground. Maude returns at that exact moment, gets hit by the T-shirts and falls <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bleachers to her death on the parking lot.|$|E
5|$|Six {{versions}} of the 8-foot high vault were built, each with specific uses. One of the vaults was a façade built onto {{the front of a}} semitruck and was used for filming close shots of the vault destroying street cars. Another vault was a reinforced, four-wheel self-drive vehicle that was connected to 30-foot cables and dragged through the streets of San Juan by the two stunt Dodge Chargers. The four-ton vault was driven by stunt driver Henry Kingi, who had to wear a temperature controlled suit to compensate for the temperatures within that could exceed 100 degrees. A scene where the vault tumbled as the cars rounded a corner was a practical effect, and the result was more violent than the filmmakers had anticipated. Over 200 vehicles were destroyed by the vault during filming. Several stunts had to be cut including a final scene that would have seen the vault hanging <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Teodoro Moscoso Bridge. This stunt was abandoned when it was determined that even the powerful Chargers {{would not be able to}} support the vault's weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a Floorless Coaster has one main {{difference}} from traditional steel roller coasters around the world: it has no floors between the seats. While a train is in the station, a floor is used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row has nothing {{in front of it}} to stop riders from walking <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. The gate then opens, allowing the train to move forward. When the train returns to the station, the floor is brought back up and the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster. Aside from the station, a Floorless Coaster has several inversions similar to B's Sitting Coasters.|$|E

5|$|The {{script is}} {{characterized}} by numerous inexplicable mood and personality shifts in characters. In analyzing the film's abrupt tone shifts, Greg Sestero highlighted two scenes in particular. In the first scene, Johnny enters the rooftop {{in the middle of}} a tirade about being accused of domestic abuse, only to become abruptly cheerful upon seeing Mark; a few moments later, he laughs inappropriately upon learning that a friend of Mark's had been severely beaten. On set, Sestero and first assistant director Sandy Schklair repeatedly tried to convince Wiseau that the line should not be delivered as comical, but Wiseau refused to refrain from laughing. In the second instance, occurring a few scenes later, Mark attempts to kill Peter by throwing him off a roof after Peter expresses his belief that Mark is having an affair with Lisa; just as Peter is about to fall to his death, Mark pulls Peter back <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof, apologizes, and the two continue their previous conversation with no acknowledgement of what just occurred.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, {{she sends}} Lauren {{a message and}} meets her outside the police station, looking rough, as she has been arrested for shoplifting. Whitney opts to live with Dot Branning (June Brown) instead of her close family, but Dot convinces her {{to move back to}} Ricky's. When Ryan returns from a holiday, he learns of Whitney's ordeal and urges her to go to the police and get tested for sexually transmitted infections. She says she is not ready to go to the police but agrees to the test, which shows she has a chlamydia infection. When Whitney starts a relationship with a man named Lee (Mitchell Hunt), it is revealed that he is a friend of Rob's, and when Whitney agrees to meet Lee by text, Rob takes control of Lee's mobile phone. She allows Rob to take her home but then tells him to wait outside while she escapes through the back door and hitches a lift to Southend-on-Sea with friends. She leaves him a voicemail message not knowing that he has followed her. He finds her in her hotel room and tells her how much he loves her, but when Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) comes in, Rob attacks him, so Whitney tells him to leave. Fatboy calls Ryan, who comes to Southend to look for Rob. When he finds him, they fight and fall <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pier. The next day, a body is recovered from the sea, and is later revealed to be Rob who has died. Whitney thinks Ryan may also be dead until he appears. She tells him she has told the police everything about Rob, including Ryan's fight with him, and Ryan tells Whitney he has to leave. They say an emotional farewell.|$|E
25|$|Shancai, {{seeing that}} his teacher was in danger, hobbled uphill. Guanyin then jumped <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliff, {{and soon after}} this the three bandits followed. Shancai, still wanting to save his teacher, managed to crawl his way over the cliff edge.|$|E

25|$|The {{railway network}} is very dense. All major cities are connected, and between Olten and Lausanne {{there are two}} main lines: One passing over Bern and Fribourg, the other passing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jura with Solothurn, Biel, Neuchâtel and Yverdon-les-Bains. The train ride from Zurich to Bern takes one hour; {{crossing}} the entire Swiss Plateau from St. Gallen to Geneva takes four hours.|$|E
25|$|After {{repelling}} the Ethiopian attack, the British force moved onto Magdala {{the following}} day. As the British approached, Tewodros released two hostages on parole to offer terms. Napier insisted on {{release of the}} hostages and an unconditional surrender. Tewodros refused to unconditionally surrender, but released the European hostages over the next two days, while the native hostages had their hands and feet amputated before being thrown <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precipice surrounding the plateau.|$|E
25|$|Rotary swaging {{is usually}} a cold working process, used to reduce the diameter, produce a taper, or add a point to a round workpiece. It can also impart {{internal}} shapes in hollow workpieces {{through the use of}} a mandrel (the shape must have a constant cross-section). Swaging a bearing into a housing means either flaring its groove's lips onto the chamfer of the housing, or flaring the housing's material <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bearing. The flaring is done with a pair of rolls that travel around the hole and are fed down into the part, deforming the metal in a controlled, predicted way. Grease is often used to lubricate this swaging process, which is also called roller swaging.|$|E

25|$|Wilbur Glenn Voliva, who in 1906 {{took over}} the Christian Catholic Church, a Pentecostal sect that {{established}} a utopian community at Zion, Illinois, preached flat Earth doctrine from 1915 onwards and used {{a photograph of a}} twelve-mile stretch of the shoreline at Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin taken three feet above the waterline to prove his point. When the airship Italia disappeared on an expedition to the North Pole in 1928 he warned the world's press that it had sailed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. He offered a $5,000 award for proving the Earth is not flat, under his own conditions. Teaching a globular Earth was banned in the Zion schools and the message was transmitted on his WCBD radio station.|$|E
25|$|Rincewind was {{the first}} protagonist of Discworld; a wizard with no skill, no wizardly qualifications, and no {{interest}} in heroics. He is the archetypal coward but is constantly thrust into extremely dangerous adventures. In The Last Hero, he flatly states {{that he does not}} wish to join an expedition to explore <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Disc—but, being fully geared for the expedition at the time, clarifies by saying that any amount of protesting on his part is futile, as something will eventually occur that will bring him into the expedition anyway. As such, he not only constantly succeeds in staying alive, but also saves Discworld on several occasions, and has an instrumental role in the emergence of life on Roundworld (Science of Discworld).|$|E
25|$|Whymper {{and party}} stayed {{an hour on}} the summit. Then they began their descent. Croz descended first, then Hadow, Hudson and Douglas, Taugwalder senior, Whymper with Taugwalder junior coming last. They climbed down with great care, only one man moving at a time. When they were barely an hour from the summit and were all on the rope, Hadow slipped and fell on Croz, who was in front of him. Croz, who was unprepared, was unable to {{withstand}} the shock; they both fell and pulled down Hudson and Douglas. On hearing Croz's shout, Whymper and Taugwalder clasped the rocks; they stood firm but the rope broke. Whymper saw them slide down the slope, trying with convulsive hands to stop themselves, and then falling from rock to rock and finally disappearing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precipice.|$|E

25|$|The two of {{them are}} taken {{to the edge of the}} Discworld by the ocean {{currents}} and nearly carried over, but they are caught by the Circumfence, a huge net built by the nation of Krull to catch sea life and flotsam washed in from the rest of the Discworld. They are rescued by Tethis the sea troll, a being composed of water who had fallen off the edge of his own world and onto the Discworld, where he was subsequently enslaved by the Krullians. Rincewind and Twoflower are then taken by the Krullians to their capital, where they learn that the Krullians intend to discover the sex of Great A'Tuin by launching a space capsule <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Disc, and plan to sacrifice Rincewind and Twoflower to get the god Fate to smile on the voyage, Fate insisting on their sacrifice after they caused him to lose the earlier game. Rincewind and Twoflower attempt to escape, but end up stealing the capsule, which is launched with Twoflower inside, the tourist wishing to see the other worlds of the universe. Rincewind is unable to get into the capsule in time, and falls off the Disc alongside it, the Luggage following them soon after.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{wait out}} the storm so they can restore {{communications}} and be rescued. As the crew struggles against the cold, they find an NTI has formed an animated column of water and is exploring the base. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated by it and cuts it in half by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. The crew soon realize that Coffey is suffering paranoia from high-pressure nervous syndrome. Spying on him through a remote operated vehicle, they find he and another SEAL are arming the warhead to attack the NTIs, and race to stop him. Bud fights Coffey but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead, and Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub. Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub is damaged and drifts <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trough, and he is crushed when the sub implodes from high pressures. The other mini-sub is also damaged and is taking on water; with only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia when the ocean's cold water engulfs her, and Bud swims back with her body to the platform. There, he and the crew administer CPR and revive her, and Bud and Lindsey reaffirm their lost love.|$|E
500|$|He {{has made}} sculptures of David Hume and Adam Smith, {{philosophers}} of the Scottish Enlightenment, which {{stand in the}} Royal Mile in Edinburgh. Hume is depicted in a [...] philosopher's toga, representing the timelessness of philosophical thought, a decision which was criticised as atavistic after the unveiling in 1996, though Stoddart remained stoic, [...] "So here I discovered that the right thing, done in public, will often earn one great disapproval: a lesson for life – in the modern age at least." [...] Local philosophy students soon began a tradition of rubbing the statue's toe to absorb some of his knowledge. Though Stoddart placed the foot <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plinth to encourage such engagement, {{the irony of the}} practice given Hume's critiques of superstition has been remarked upon.|$|E
