5|$|Antibody {{tests in}} {{children}} younger than 18months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of maternal antibodies. Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA, or via testing for the p24 antigen. Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing. In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007–2009 between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status. In 2009, between 3.6 and 42% <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> Sub-Saharan countries were tested which represented a significant increase compared to previous years.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{attempts}} to romance Rain Turner, a gorgeous young woman auditioning {{for a role}} in his new film, leading her on {{with the promise of}} being cast, all the while knowing she is too old for the part. His narration reveals he has done this with a number <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the past, and yet often comes out of the relationship hurt and damaged himself. Over the course of their relationship, he is stalked by unknown persons driving a Jeep and is frequently reminded by various individuals of the grisly murder of a young producer whom he knew. Clay disinterestedly watches a snuff film of the murder—later attributed to Rip—on his iPhone.|$|E

25|$|The Victorian American {{conception}} {{of sexuality and}} other roles <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> society and to one another were being challenged. Modern clothing was lighter and more flexible, better suiting the modern woman such as the flapper who wanted to engage in active sport. Women were now becoming more assertive and less willing to keep the home fires burning. The flappers' costume was seen as sexual and raised deeper questions of the behavior and values it symbolized.|$|E

25|$|While Anglicans {{consolidated}} their hold on {{the upper}} classes, workingmen and farmers responded to the Methodist revivals, often sponsored by visiting preachers from the United States. Typical was Rev. James Caughey, an American sent by the Wesleyan Methodist Church from the 1840s through 1864. He brought in the converts by the score, most notably in the revivals in Canada West 1851–53. His technique combined restrained emotionalism with a call for personal commitment, coupled with follow-up action to organize support from converts. It {{was a time when}} the Holiness Movement caught fire, with the revitalized interest <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> Christian perfection.

Bebe Moore Campbell's 1992 novel Your Blues Ain't Like Mine centers on the events of Till's death. Toni Morrison's play Dreaming Emmett (1986), is a feminist look at the roles <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> black society, which she was inspired to write while considering [...] "time through the eyes of one person who could come back to life and seek vengeance." [...] Emmylou Harris includes a song called [...] "My Name is Emmett Till" [...] on her 2011 album, Hard Bargain. According to scholar Christopher Metress, Till is often reconfigured in literature as a specter that haunts the white people of Mississippi, causing them to question their involvement in evil, or silence about injustice. The 2002 book Mississippi Trials, 1955 is a fictionalized account of Till's death. In 2016 artist Dana Schutz painted Open Casket, a controversial work based on photographs of Till in his coffin as well as on an account by Till's mother of seeing him after his death.|$|E
