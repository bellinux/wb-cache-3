In March 1984 the Council of the Law Society of England and Wales attempted to press for full rights of audience for solicitors, something the Bar was heavily opposed to. The dispute {{came to the attention of}} the public when Cyril Smith's solicitor asked to read <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> settling a libel action in the High Court—he was refused, both at the High Court and the Court of Appeal, although a practice statement issued by the Court of Appeal in 1986 indicated that they felt solicitors should be allowed to appear in front of the High Court and Court of appeal in formal proceedings.|$|E

500|$|Because Sherwood Anderson was so {{ambiguous}} {{about what}} directly influenced him, {{it is difficult}} to say that any specific writer or work inspired him to write Winesburg, Ohio as a whole.

Fine Gael candidate Gay Mitchell suffered from lack of recognition by many voters, and suffered heavily for his controversial views on suicide and on Ireland joining the Commonwealth. Labour candidate Michael D. Higgins was pursued by his past links to the unpopular Fianna Fáil and his admission that he had smoked cannabis. Independent candidate Dana Rosemary Scallon interrupted the Prime Time debate, moderated by Miriam O'Callaghan, to read <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> condemning a [...] "malicious" [...] and [...] "false" [...] accusation that she had heard had been made against her family.

The Proms continued throughout the war years, with fewer major new works than before, although there were nevertheless British premieres of pieces by Bartók, Stravinsky and Debussy. An historian of the Proms, Ateş Orga, wrote, [...] "Concerts often had to be re-timed to coincide with the 'All Clear' between air raids.

[...] The devisers of the programme were quick to realise that whilst a newspaper's publicity may sometimes boost a soap's position in the ratings, it could equally help to tarnish it.

[...] Grantham was hounded by the press and the BBC was forced to put <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> supporting him and their decision to employ a convicted murderer. In order to keep the press at bay, Grantham was smuggled out of the studios by the back route and decoy cars were used to lure the press away from his home, all of which put an increasing strain on the actor. Eventually the furor quieted down, but it never went away entirely and nearly every article written about the actor during his first stint in the show referenced his past.

2500|$|By 1940, the Japanisation of Manchuria {{had become}} extreme, and an altar to the Shinto goddess Amaterasu {{was built on}} the grounds of Puyi's palace. The origins of the altar are unclear, with the postwar Japanese {{claiming}} that Puyi aimed for a closer connection to the Japanese Emperor as a means of resisting the political machinations of the Manchukuo elites, while Puyi in his Chinese Communist-published autobiography claims that he was forced to submit to this by the Japanese. During his visit to Japan in 1940 for Kigensetsu, which was marked with especially lavish celebrations that year to mark the supposed 2,600thanniversary of the founding of the Empire of Japan by the mythical Emperor Jimmu on 11February 660BC, Puyi during his meeting with the Showa Emperor read <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> given to him by General Yoshioka asking for permission to worship the Shinto gods and to establish Shintoism as the state religion of Manchukuo. The Showa Emperor replied [...] "I must comply with your wishes" [...] and gave him three relics, namely a bronze mirror, a sword and a piece of jade (reproductions of the Imperial Regalia of Japan) to take home with him {{to be the center of}} Shinto worship in Manchukuo. Puyi later wrote [...] "I thought Beijing antique shops were full of such objects. Were these a great god? Were those my ancestors? I burst into tears on the drive back." [...] Since in the Japanese state religion of Shintoism the Japanese Emperor was worshiped as a living god, worshiping at the Shinto shrine in the Salt Tax Palace also meant worshiping the Showa Emperor as a god, which starkly underlined Puyi's subordination to the Showa Emperor. In any case, Puyi's wartime duties came to include sitting through Chinese-language Shinto prayers. Hirohito was surprised when he heard of this, asking why a Temple of Heaven had not been built instead. After his second visit to Japan, Puyi announced in a press statement that Japan and Manchukuo were [...] "unified in virtue and heart", praised the Shinto Sun Goddess Amaterasu for her [...] "divine intervention" [...] in 1931 that supposedly made Manchukuo possible, and hailed the Showa Emperor as a living god as the House of Yamato were all alleged to be the direct descendants of Amterasu. Already at the Manchukuo Military Academy that was training officers for the Manchukuo army, the cadets were being taught to serve the [...] "two emperors" [...] with the cadets kowtowing to portraits of both the emperors of Manchukuo and Japan.|$|E
