5|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are relatively inefficient at converting <b>on-board</b> fuel energy to propulsion {{as most of}} the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while the engine is idling. Electric motors, on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric drive vehicles do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through regenerative braking. Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach <b>on-board</b> efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have <b>on-board</b> efficiencies of around 80%.|$|E

5|$|As {{the result}} of the {{accidents}} in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably following the 1985 crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191, in 1988 the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have <b>on-board</b> wind shear detection systems by 1993. Between 1964 and 1985, wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries. Since 1995, the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years, due to the mandated <b>on-board</b> detection as well as the addition of Doppler weather radar units on the ground (NEXRAD). The installation of high-resolution Terminal Doppler Weather Radar stations at many U.S. airports that are commonly affected by wind shear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear conditions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Project work is {{very common}} in today’s organizations. For various tasks {{projects}} are even the dominant organizational form in practice. Compared to {{the work in the}} line organization projects are for example cross-functional and temporarily. Due to this aspect, the staffing process occurs more regularly than in the standard line organization. However, the <b>on-boarding</b> process of new project team members – in this work understood as the practices to integrate the newcomers into the existing project team – is not covered by a lot of research results. Research projects focus rather on other aspects of knowledge management in project contexts. In addition, related fields do only provide limited insights into the process of new team member project <b>on-boarding.</b> Thus, a gap in existing research result remains. This research project aims to close this gap and to provide insights into the process of project <b>on-boarding.</b> To provide practical guidance concrete aspects of the <b>on-boarding</b> like useful information sources and successful methods are investigated. More specifically the following research questions guide the project: Which methods & tools are used to provide employees project-related information during the introduction phase, how are they used in practice and how effective are these methods? Which information sources do new project team members search actively to get the information required to fulfill their new tasks, how are they used and how effective are these information sources? How are the various <b>on-boarding</b> processes structured, coordinated and monitored in practice and how effective are the <b>on-boarding</b> processes? To investigate the subject the research project is structured as follows: Based on a literature review a quantitative survey (web-based questionnaire) is designed. The responses are analyzed and a quantitative overview of the applied methods, the used information sources and the <b>on-boarding</b> results is given. In a qualitative research step, additional interviews are performed to cover more complex aspects of the <b>on-boarding</b> process and to complement the quantitative results. The interviews with the project managers and project team members are analyzed to develop detailed descriptions. Based on the analysis of the overall responses, the following can be summarized: Successful project managers do carefully analyze the project context to structure the <b>on-boarding</b> process accordingly. The curiosity and openness of team members is emphasized on and is often increased by an active communication of the project goals, the development of the project and the specific role and expected contribution of the newcomers. Project managers need to be highly available for the new team members because they are appreciated as the number one source of information during the project encounter...|$|R

40|$|More {{and more}} {{software}} startups {{are moving to}} a subscription-based Software as a Service (SaaS) model.

40|$|Abstract. As {{the volume}} of digital data rapidly increases, storage clouds are {{becoming}} a popular solution for both enterprise and personal data, {{and the number of}} storage cloud solutions is also increasing. However, these solutions do not yet deal with the need of customers for interoperability and data migration from one cloud to another. These issues can be addressed through federation of cloud infrastructures. An important aspect of federation is delegation of access control, where one actor, e. g., an end user, authorizes another actor, e. g., a cloud provider, to act on its behalf, typically with a subset of its access rights, safely and securely. This paper deals with delegation across storage clouds. We describe a delegation architecture for <b>on-boarding</b> federation, which allows an enterprise to efficiently migrate its data from one storage cloud provider to another (e. g., for business or legal reasons), while providing continuous access and a unified view over the data during the migration. In our architecture a user delegates a subset of his access rights on the source and destination clouds to an <b>on-boarding</b> federation layer on the destination cloud. This enables <b>on-boarding</b> to occur in a safe and secure way, such that the <b>on-boarding</b> layer has the least privilege required to carry out its work. We evaluate the security implications of delegation that need {{to be taken into account}} for <b>on-boarding.</b> We also show how the delegation architecture can be implemented using the Security Assertion Markup Language...|$|R

40|$|Project (M. B. A., Business Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Develop an <b>on-boarding</b> program {{specifically}} for new leaders to Catholic Healthcare West (CHW) corporate that would improve their socialization into {{the culture of}} CHW. Sources of Data Employee surveys, company websites, management interviews, needs assessments, publications Conclusions Reached The organizational problem CHW encountered {{can be attributed to}} the fact that new leaders were not receiving the strategic or departmental coaching needed to feel productive or successful in their new position. The active involvement of Human Resources, the CHW Learning Institute and existing managers are essential to establish a long-term relationship with the new leader that begins prior to being hired and will endure through everyday trials of the workplace. Depending on the needs and requirements, the length of the <b>on-boarding</b> process will vary across departments and leadership positions. The implementation of a leadership <b>on-boarding</b> program will help CHW align individual behaviors with strategic corporate objectives. As a result of a successful implementation of the proposed <b>on-boarding</b> program, CHW should experience an increase in employee and leader productivity and job engagement.

5|$|In DragonFly, each CPU {{has its own}} thread scheduler. Upon creation, threads are {{assigned}} to processors and are never preemptively switched from one processor to another; they are only migrated by the passing of an inter-processor interrupt (IPI) message between the CPUs involved. Inter-processor thread scheduling is also accomplished by sending asynchronous IPI messages. One advantage to this clean compartmentalization of the threading subsystem is that the processors' <b>on-board</b> caches in Symmetric Multiprocessor Systems do not contain duplicated data, allowing for higher performance by giving each processor in the system {{the ability to use}} its own cache to store different things to work on.|$|E
