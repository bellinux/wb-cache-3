40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} design of a novel short stress path <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> which is used for teaching and research. The <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> can implement the asymmetric rolling by {{the way of the}} adjustment of upper roll speed, and also working as conventional rolling when the roll speeds of two rolls are equal. The <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> can produce not only the plate and sheet, but also profiles by the roll of different grooves. The <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> is appropriate for the rolling of the steels and nonferrous metals. In this paper, the design ideas and main parameters of principal components are presented with respect to the new <b>rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> It can provide references for the design and manufacture of <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> of similar functions and structures...|$|R
50|$|A {{tandem mill}} {{is a special}} type of modern <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> where <b>rolling</b> is done in one pass. In a {{traditional}} <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> <b>rolling</b> is done in several passes, but in tandem mill there are several stands (>=2 stands) and reductions take place successively. The number of stands ranges from 2 to 18. Tandem mills can be either of hot or cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> types.|$|R
30|$|However, most of {{the cold}} <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> are 6 -high UCM <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> or 4 -high CVC <b>rolling</b> <b>mills.</b> Given that the 4 -high CVC mill has work roll {{shifting}} function, it can use the K-WRS technology to realize similar function of the 6 -high UCMW mill [79]. However, the edge drop control capacity of the 6 -high UCM <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> is obviously insufficient {{because of the lack}} of work roll shifting function. Sun, et al. [80], adopted a single-side straight-taper work roll profile to enhance the edge drop control capacity of the 6 -high UCM <b>rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> He, et al. [81], designed a sextic polynomial work roll curve and achieved remarkable results.|$|R

The {{sustained}} <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> vibration on high-speed cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> or smooth mill {{could cause}} that periodicity sheet thickness difference or board {{light and dark}} stripes, or rolling processing interruption for the large vibration intensity. Dynamic load behavior of the <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> rack including the load magnitude and load property usually was the reason of the vibration, which caused the vibration modal with diversity and uncertainty.

40|$|Abstract: All {{over the}} India, {{most of the}} {{processing}} industries are involved with rolling operations for steel and alloyed materials. To perform these operations, <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> are used. But maintenance of such <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> is a tedious job, because these <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> work under certain critical conditions such as frequent load variations, higher temperatures etc. Hence, every component bears load variations, which results in wear and tear of components. This causes frequent breakdowns of <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> components. Thus, it involves lot of maintenance cost, loss of production time, more number of workforces to perform maintenance action etc. One such <b>rolling</b> <b>mill,</b> which is situated in Hingna MIDC, Nagpur is taken {{as a case study}} in the present work. This <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> uses preventive and break-down maintenance strategies. But, these strategies seem to be inadequate. To reduce the losses, a new logic along with a new maintenance technique is suggested through this present work. This maintenance technique is nothing but “vibration based condition monitoring”, which is discussed with following articles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — {{the process}} of plastic {{deformation}} of metal by passing it through the rolls called as the metal rolling. Rolling is widely used forming process, which can have high production figures and precise control of final product. Rolling is classified in two major parts the cold rolling and hot rolling. Every part has its own theory, development of rolling process and subsequently the designing of the cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> components, like rolls and <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing. The aim of the present paper is to understand the various methodologies which are used to design the cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> We {{have focused on the}} history of the rolling process; it is understand that the rolling process was adopted since year 1590. Although it was raw method but it initiated the slitting <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> and the actual experimentation were started from year 1670. In those days rolling was concerned with rolling of bars only after few years the rolling of bars were started. We also tried to discuss the earlier patents which were granted in 18 th century and was related to the tandem mill which were using copper and brass as the rolling materials. In year 1783, after the entry of grooved rolls the rolling production increased up to 15 times and that was the start of modern <b>rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> While reviewing the design of <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> components our area of interest is to visit design of rollers and <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing. We have discussed the different parameters and factors that affect the roll design. The calculations for the power required for rolling operation and the roll dimensions are also discussed. In reviewing the design of <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing, we try to explain the load that comes on the rolls during the rolling operations and how it affects the bearing life. The <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing designed optimisation has achieved by using different Finite Element Analysis techniques and various experimentation for <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing structural analysis is also reviewed...|$|R

Firstly, we establish a monitor automatic gauge control (MAGC) {{model for a}} practical cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> system. The new model is with mismatched uncertainties. Then, an extended state observer (ESO) is developed to estimate uncertainties. In the general high-order systems, the ESO {{is also used to}} estimate states. By dynamic surface control method, we design the controller to guarantee stabilization of the cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> system. Furthermore, we extend proposed method to general high-order systems, in which we analyze the difference from cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> system. Finally, simulation results for MAGC system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy...|$|R

The existing <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> in India are using the 3 phase induction motor and flywheel to drive the <b>rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> The electric motor transmits the power to flywheel {{with the help of}} V-belt. An attempt has made after analysis of existing mill that by using some soft starting arrangement, which can be use as a clutch in between the motor and flywheel reduces the horse power of main drive which save the energy consumption of <b>rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> The optimum selection of drive can help in reducing the horse power of main electric motor {{and at the same time}} capable of energies the flywheel. An experimental analysis is done by using flat belt drive and motor sliding arrangement in order to reduce the H. P. of main electric motor. In this paper an attempt has made after analyzing the existing rolling that a mechanical soft starting arrangement is designed and tested on prototype <b>rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> The soft starting arrangement used in this protype <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> analysed and concluded that in the actual <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> the motor used are oversized which consumes the more energy.

50|$|The {{invention}} of the <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> in Europe {{may be attributed to}} Leonardo da Vinci in his drawings. The earliest <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> in crude form but the same basic principles were found in Middle East and South Asia as early as 600 BCE. Earliest <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> were slitting mills, which were introduced from what is now Belgium to England in 1590. These passed flat bars between rolls to form a plate of iron, which was then passed between grooved rolls (slitters) to produce rods of iron. The first experiments at rolling iron for tinplate took place about 1670. In 1697, Major John Hanbury erected a mill at Pontypool to roll 'Pontypool plates'—blackplate. Later this began to be rerolled and tinned to make tinplate. The earlier production of plate iron in Europe had been in forges, not <b>rolling</b> <b>mills.</b>|$|R
