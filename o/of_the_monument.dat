5|$|Craters of the Moon is {{in south-central}} Idaho, midway between Boise and Yellowstone National Park. The lava field reaches southeastward from the Pioneer Mountains. Combined U.S. Highway 20–26–93 {{cuts through the}} northwestern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> and {{provides}} access to it. However, the rugged landscape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> itself remains remote and undeveloped, with only one paved road across the northern end.|$|E
5|$|A concave line of {{abrasion}} {{and polishing}} {{can be found}} on both one of the central kerb-stones on the western end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> and a kerb-stone on the south-east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b> These have been attributed to the sharpening of flint and other stone axe-blades on these sarsens. It is possible that these tools were sharpened for use in cutting and carving the timber levers and struts which would have been used in erecting the stones and constructing the tomb. Similar evidence for the sharpening of tools has been found at West Kennet Long Barrow, as well as later prehistoric monuments such as Stonehenge.|$|E

Native grasses that form sod in parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> include Sandberg's bluegrass and other bluegrass species. Reed canary grass, if mowed, also forms sod along stream banks.|$|E

5|$|Professor Pete Wilson, {{on behalf}} of English Heritage's Portico Properties Research Project, has {{suggested}} questions for future research and investigation of the site, including: excavation to establish its date and function; examination of historic documentation for medieval mention of use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> as a route or in a boundary dispute; {{and analysis of the}} site via a detailed aerial survey, lidar or other remote sensing technique to establish the extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> beyond the length so far excavated.|$|E
5|$|The {{documentation}} of the various phrases of the construction {{makes no mention of}} anyone other than Bernardino delle Croci, {{but it is not clear}} if he really had the skills the create a sculptural structure of this type. A reappraisal of Brescian art of the period, as well as the clear evidence of the style, have led critics to assign to Cairano the execution of the stone parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument,</b> limiting delle Croci's involvement only to the bronze inserts. The jeweller, consequently, assumed the entire Martinengo commission but entrusted the parts outside his competence, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> in fact, to the Cairano studio.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} is {{not without}} its critics. Alana Vincent has argued that constituent parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> are in conflict, and as a result the message conveyed by the monument is not unified. Visually, Vincent argues there is a dichotomy between the triumphant pose of the figures {{at the top of the}} pylons and the mourning posture of those figures at the base. Textually, she argues the inscription text celebrating the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge strikes a very different tone to the list of names of the missing at the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b>|$|E

The cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> was stated to be $13,000 by The New York Times, but report stated it to be $12,000.

5|$|In 1981, {{members of}} the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit {{conducted}} a measured survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b> In 2005, Ashbee noted {{that he had found}} evidence of recent metal detectoring activity at the site. On 15 May 2007, the Kentish archaeologist Brian Philp was conducting his regular inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> when the property owner, Mrs Bygrave, pointed out to him an area where the road was beginning to subside. He alerted Kent County Council, who organised for contractors to investigate the reason for the subsidence, which proved to be decades of rabbit burrowing beneath the tarmac. Archaeologists from Kent Archaeological Unit visited the site during the work, discovering a buried sarsen; comparison with older records revealed that this stone had once been upright but had been buried where it stood in the 19th century by workmen who were replacing the trackway with a paved road.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 2004 the {{monument}} closed for a $15 million renovation, which included numerous security upgrades and redesign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> grounds by landscape architect Laurie Olin.

The monument reopened April 1, 2005, while the surrounding grounds remained closed until the landscape was finished later that summer.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch East Indies {{government}} then commissioned F.C. Wilsen, a Dutch engineering official, {{who studied}} the monument and drew hundreds of relief sketches. J.F.G. Brumund was also appointed to make a detailed study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument,</b> which was completed in 1859. The government intended to publish an article based on Brumund's study supplemented by Wilsen's drawings, but Brumund refused to cooperate. The government then commissioned another scholar, C. Leemans, who compiled a monograph based on Brumund's and Wilsen's sources. In 1873, the first monograph of the detailed study of Borobudur was published, followed by its French translation a year later. The first photograph <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> was taken in 1872 by a Dutch-Flemish engraver, Isidore van Kinsbergen.|$|E
5|$|The Mourning Parents, {{one male}} and one female figure, are {{reclining}} {{on either side}} of the western steps on the reverse side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b> They represent the mourning mothers and fathers of the nation and are likely patterned on the four statues by Michelangelo on the Medici Tomb in Florence. Inscribed on the outside wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> are the names of the 11,285 Canadians killed in France whose final resting place is unknown. Most Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials present names in a descending list format in a manner that permits the modification of panels as remains are found and identified. Allward instead sought to present the names as a seamless list and decided to do so by inscribing the names in continuous bands, across both vertical and horizontal seams, around the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b> As a consequence, as remains were discovered it was not possible to remove commemorated names without interrupting the seamless list, and as a consequence there are individuals who have a known grave but are commemorated on the memorial. The memorial contains the names of four posthumous Victoria Cross recipients; Robert Grierson Combe, Frederick Hobson, William Johnstone Milne, and Robert Spall.|$|E
