5|$|The {{contract}} for the Di6 called for the first delivery in February 1995. Several components were to be manufactured by NSB, including the fuel tanks, sandboxes, engine frames, alternators and some components for the bogies. The first locomotive was delivered on 7 March 1996, but quickly proved to not meet the specifications in the contract. In particular, the locomotives had too high fuel consumption and the bogies had faults, as they had too high track forces. Both of these issues were difficult to solve. The Di6 also had problems with overheating, in particular in the main alternators, the oil cooler and the brakes. The <b>on-board</b> <b>computer</b> failed when the outdoor temperature fell too low.|$|E

25|$|Mars Pathfinder {{directly}} entered Mars {{atmosphere in}} a retrograde direction from a hyperbolic trajectory at 6.1km/s using an atmospheric entry aeroshell (capsule) that {{was derived from}} the original Viking Mars lander design. The aeroshell consisted of a back shell and a specially designed ablative heatshield to slow to 370m/s (830mph) where a supersonic disk-gap-band parachute was inflated to slow its descent through the thin Martian atmosphere to 68m/s (about 160mph). The lander's <b>on-board</b> <b>computer</b> used redundant on-board accelerometers to determine the timing of the parachute inflation. Twenty seconds later the heatshield was pyrotechnically released. Another twenty seconds later the lander was separated and lowered from the backshell on a 20m bridle (tether). When the lander reached 1.6km above the surface, a radar was used by the <b>on-board</b> <b>computer</b> to determine altitude and descent velocity. This information was used by the computer to determine the precise timing of the landing events that followed.|$|E

25|$|Two Soviet probes {{were sent}} to Mars in 1988 {{as part of the}} Phobos program. Phobos 1 {{operated}} normally until an expected communications session on 2 September 1988 failed to occur. The problem was traced to a software error, which deactivated attitude thrusters causing the spacecrafts' solar arrays to no longer point at the Sun, depleting Phobos 1 batteries. Phobos 2 operated normally throughout its cruise and Mars orbital insertion phases on January 29, 1989, gathering data on the Sun, interplanetary medium, Mars, and Phobos. Shortly before the final phase of the mission, during which the spacecraft was to approach within 50 m of Phobos' surface and release two landers, one a mobile 'hopper', the other a stationary platform, contact with Phobos 2 was lost. The mission ended when the spacecraft signal failed to be successfully reacquired on March 27, 1989. The cause of the failure was determined to be a malfunction of the <b>on-board</b> <b>computer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The USSR {{intended}} {{to have the}} first artificial satellite of Mars beating the planned American Mariner 8 and Mariner 9 Mars orbiters. In May 1971, one day after Mariner 8 malfunctioned at launch and failed to reach orbit, Cosmos 419 (Mars 1971C), a heavy probe of the Soviet Mars program M-71, also failed to launch. This spacecraft was designed as an orbiter only, while the next two probes of project M-71, Mars 2 and Mars 3, were multipurpose combinations of an orbiter and a lander with small skis-walking rovers {{that would be the}} first planet rovers outside the Moon. They were successfully launched in mid-May 1971 and reached Mars about seven months later. On November 27, 1971 the lander of Mars 2 crash-landed due to an <b>on-board</b> <b>computer</b> malfunction and became the first man-made object to reach the surface of Mars. On 2 December 1971, the Mars 3 lander became the first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing, but its transmission was interrupted after 14.5 seconds.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} {{of the next generation}} of Saab's multirole combat aircraft the JAS 39 Gripen includes developing a lot of new software for the aircraft's <b>on-board</b> <b>computers.</b> The new software has to be loaded into these computers routinely, in order to carry out testing on it. This is currently a slow and tedious process. In order to load the computers a protocol defined in the ARINC 615 A standard is used. Today Saab uses commercial software applications implementing this protocol for the loading process. These applications have significant disadvantages, such as not being able to load several computers in parallel or only being able to load computers from a specific manufacturer. In this thesis we introduce a system using a client-server architecture that allows users to load the computers in parallel, regardless of the manufacturer. In Section 3. 2. 2 we show that our system reduces the time required to load the aircraft's <b>on-board</b> <b>computers</b> significantly. We also indicate some improvements that can be made in order to speed up the process even further. These improvements mainly involve improving the <b>on-board</b> <b>computers</b> themselves through the use of faster persistent storage and support for later revisions of the protocol involved...|$|R

25|$|Once {{the lander}} was 355 m above the ground, airbags were {{inflated}} {{in less than}} a second using three catalytically cooled solid rocket motors that served as gas generators. The airbags were made of 4 inter-connected multi-layer vectran bags that surrounded the tetrahedron lander. They were designed and tested to accommodate grazing angle impacts as high as 28m/s. However, as the airbags were designed for no more than about 15m/s vertical impacts, three solid retrorockets were mounted above the lander in the backshell. These were fired at 98m above the ground. The lander's <b>on-board</b> <b>computer</b> estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0m/s between 15 and 25m above the ground. After 2.3 seconds, while the rockets were still firing, the lander cut the bridle loose about 21.5m above the ground and fell to the ground. The rockets flew up and away with the backshell and parachute (they have since been sighted by orbital images). The lander impacted at 14m/s and limited the impact to only 18G of deceleration. The first bounce was 15.7m high and continued bouncing for at least 15 additional bounces (accelerometer data recording did not continue through all of the bounces).|$|E
