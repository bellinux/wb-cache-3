5|$|Apart {{from his}} own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day {{generally}} rejected him as the Messiah, as do {{the great majority of}} Jews today. Christian theologians, ecumenical councils, reformers and <b>others</b> <b>have</b> written extensively about Jesus over the centuries.

5|$|In {{many groups}} of crustaceans, the fertilised eggs are simply {{released}} into the water column, while <b>others</b> <b>have</b> developed a number of mechanisms for {{holding on to the}} eggs until they are ready to hatch. Most decapods carry the eggs attached to the pleopods, while peracarids, notostracans, anostracans, and many isopods form a brood pouch from the carapace and thoracic limbs. Female Branchiura do not carry eggs in external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks and other objects. Most leptostracans and krill carry the eggs between their thoracic limbs; some copepods carry their eggs in special thin-walled sacs, while <b>others</b> <b>have</b> them attached together in long, tangled strings.|$|E
