Gus Grissom, who became the second American in space, also participated in the Gemini and Apollo programs, but died in January 1967 during a pre-launch test for Apollo 1. Glenn {{became the first}} American to orbit the Earth in February 1962, then quit NASA and went into politics, serving as a US Senator from 1974 to 1999, and returned to space in 1998 as a Payload Specialist aboard STS-95. Deke Slayton was grounded in 1962, but remained with NASA and was appointed Chief Astronaut at the beginning of Project Gemini. He remained in the position of senior astronaut, in charge of space crew flight assignments among many other responsibilities, until towards the end of Project Apollo, when he resigned and began training to fly on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975, which he successfully did. Gordon Cooper became the last to fly in Mercury and made its longest flight, and also flew a Gemini mission. Carpenter's Mercury flight was his only trip into space. Schirra flew the third orbital Mercury mission, and then flew a Gemini mission. Three years later, he commanded the first manned Apollo mission, becoming the only person to fly in all three <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>programs.</b>|$|E

500|$|Until the 1990s, the Act and its {{application}} to medical residents were not an issue. Many hospitals assessed and paid FICA taxes {{on behalf of their}} employees. The University of Minnesota's hospitals did not, however, and in the early 1990s, the Social Security Administration sued to recover a small portion of those taxes. An initial administrative review ruled for the Social Security Administration, but the district court reversed. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision after granting a de novo review, and the University recovered $40 million. A number of other residency programs quickly filed lawsuits, attempting to recoup the taxes they had paid. After some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>programs</b> were successful in other circuit courts, the Treasury agreed to repay the taxes it had collected. However, it also promulgated a new regulation to take effect in April 2005 that stated that any full-time employee, which includes nearly all medical residents, were ineligible to receive the student exemption, clearly stating that it was doing so to [...] "overturn court rulings that had upheld the view that residents remained students".|$|E

In 1966, 191,749 college students enrolled in ROTC. By 1973, the number was 72,459."

2500|$|Strictly speaking, an {{operating}} system (and thus, a kernel) {{is not required}} to run a computer. Programs can be directly loaded and executed on the [...] "bare metal" [...] machine, provided that the authors <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>programs</b> are willing to work without any hardware abstraction or operating system support. Most early computers operated this way during the 1950s and early 1960s, which were reset and reloaded between the execution of different programs. Eventually, small ancillary programs such as program loaders and debuggers were left in memory between runs, or loaded from ROM. As these were developed, they formed the basis of what became early operating system kernels. The [...] "bare metal" [...] approach is still used today on some video game consoles and embedded systems, but in general, newer computers use modern operating systems and kernels.|$|E
