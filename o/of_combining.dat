40|$|In this research, we find {{statistically}} significant positive abnormal returns around takeover announcements for combined firms. The cumulative average abnormal returns for combined firms are 4. 62 % over the event-window [- 20, + 20], {{which suggests that}} takeovers create shareholder wealth (synergy motive). In addition, we {{examine the impact of}} ownership structure in target firms on the abnormal returns to shareholders <b>of</b> <b>combined</b> firms. We show that management shareholdings have a significant negative impact on the returns to shareholders <b>of</b> <b>combined</b> firms (entrenchment). Institutional shareholdings and outside block holdings have a significantly positive influence on the abnormal returns to shareholder <b>of</b> <b>combined</b> firms. These results suggest that monitoring by large institutional shareholders and other outside shareholders increase the abnormal returns to shareholders <b>of</b> the <b>combined</b> firm. Furthermore, competition between bidders increases the abnormal returns to shareholders <b>of</b> <b>combined</b> firms. Competition between bidding firms might signal to high valuation bidders the availability of high, non-firm-specific synergistic gains.
