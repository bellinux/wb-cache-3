500|$|Just {{before his}} death in 1946, Keynes told Henry Clay, a {{professor}} of social economics and advisor to the Bank of England, of his hopes that Adam Smith's [...] "invisible hand" [...] could help Britain out of the economic hole it was in: [...] "I find myself more and more relying for a solution <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>problems</b> on the invisible hand which I tried to eject from economic thinking twenty years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|Since the {{departure}} of founder member Barrett in 1968, the burden of lyrical composition had fallen mostly on Waters. He is therefore credited {{as the author of}} the album's lyrics, making The Dark Side of the Moon the first of five consecutive Pink Floyd albums with lyrics credited to him alone. [...] The band were so confident {{of the quality of the}} words that, for the first time, they printed them on the album's sleeve. [...] "Roger's concerns in it are not out of date," [...] remarked Gilmour on the album's twentieth anniversary. [...] "He did a fantastic job with those words. Then, Roger was always more verbal than the rest of us, who had no great confidence in our lyric-writing. Probably, in hindsight, we should have stuck at it: the roots <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>problems</b> were being set back then. But we all got the credit and money that we were happy with." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{experience}} with King, despite only {{resulting in the}} completion of one track, [...] "Bad Boyfriend", gave the band perspective and direction. Manson said that because the band members still had problems speaking to each other, King could not get much work out of the band, so they realized {{that they needed to}} work out their differences and was the catalyst for the band getting back together and working harmoniously. Vig said that the tensions led the band members to become [...] "burned out on each other", and that reuniting made them feel able to play [...] "...fast and furiousas if our lives depended on it". Manson overcame her writer's block and began to inject political slants into her lyrics, matching them with some new material the band wrote immediately after the King sessions; both [...] "Metal Heart" [...] and [...] "Boys Wanna Fight" [...] referenced the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Despite a plan to record some material with producer Tony Hoffer, the band decided to complete the rest of the album themselves. Erikson later said, [...] "It was kind of seductive to think that maybe someone else [...] solve all <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>problems,</b> but in the end you gotta do it yourself".|$|E

2500|$|Salon later {{commented that}} the list of {{contributors}} [...] "represented a 'shock and awe' demonstration of the intellectual firepower available for deployment in mid-century America, and, almost equally impressive, {{of the art of}} editorial networking and jawboning. This was the party everyone who was anyone wanted to attend, the Black and White Ball of the critical elite." [...] The Review [...] "announced the arrival of a particular sensibility ... the engaged, literary, post-war progressive intellectual, who was concerned with civil rights and feminism as well as fiction and poetry and theater. The first issue projected [...] "a confidence in the unquestioned rightness of the liberal consensus, in the centrality of literature and its power to convey meaning, in the solubility <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>problems</b> through the application of intelligence and good will, and in the coherence and clear hierarchy of the intellectual world".|$|E
2500|$|Kelly's athleticism {{gave his}} moves a {{distinctive}} broad, muscular quality, {{and this was}} a very deliberate choice on his part, as he explained: [...] "There's a strong link between sports and dancing, and my own dancing springs from my early days as an athlete...I think dancing is a man's game and if he does it well he does it better than a woman." [...] He railed against what he saw as the widespread effeminacy in male dancing which, in his opinion, [...] "tragically" [...] stigmatized the genre, alienating boys from entering the field: [...] "Dancing does attract effeminate young men. I don't object to that as long as they don't dance effeminately. I just say that if a man dances effeminately he dances badly — just as if a woman comes out on stage and starts to sing bass. Unfortunately, people confuse gracefulness with softness. John Wayne is a graceful man and so are some of the great ball players...but, of course, they don't run the risk of being called sissies." [...] In his view, [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>problems</b> is that so much dancing is taught by women. You can spot many male dancers who have this tuition by their arm movements — they are soft, limp and feminine." [...] He acknowledged that, in spite of his efforts — in TV programs such as Dancing: A Man's Game (1958) for example — the situation changed little over the years.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1954, Orwig {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} as the athletic director at the University of Nebraska for $12,600 a year. [...] He remained at Nebraska until 1961, and during his tenure the Corhuskers started to emerge into national prominence. [...] Orwig was responsible during his seven years at Nebraska for creating the Touchdown Club, the Extra Point Club and the Husker Athletic Achievement Awards. [...] However, the football team did not fare well during Orwig's time there, as the football program went through three coaches (Bill Glassford, Pete Elliott, and Bill Jennings), and had a 27–44 record. [...] Orwig was the athletic director who hired Pete Elliott as the football coach at Nebraska in 1956. [...] Elliott later recalled, [...] "I thought the world of him. I {{thought he was a}} great guy." [...] In 1961, Orwig quit his position at Nebraska to accept the athletic director job at Indiana; news reports indicated that Orwig had been offered $20,000 a year by Indiana, $5,000 more than he was making at Nebraska. [...] At the time, Orwig said: [...] "The decision to accept the Indiana University position as Director of Athletics was a most difficult one[...] [...] [...] The people of Nebraska and the University have been most kind to me over the past 7 years. [...] Their understanding <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>problems,</b> their excellent help and their friendship have been heartwarming[...] [...] [...] I leave Nebraska with the greatest admiration for its administrative staff, its teaching staff, and its increasing educational strength[...] [...] [...] My thanks go out to all my friends throughout the state and best wishes and hopes to the Cornhuskers for many victories in the years to come." [...] Football coach Bill Jennings said, [...] "I'm sorry to see Bill leave and I'm sure everybody who has worked with him does. He's done a fine job. [...] Nebraska's loss is Indiana's gain." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{he agreed}} thoughtfully, [...] "if some American genius {{could find a}} way to legalize that power and utilize the men who created it the worst <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>problems</b> would be solved. A man with his ability has a right to power, and none would respond more quickly or more splendidly to a call of the {{government}} than he. All this fight is waste, Hugh, damned waste of the nation's energy." [...] Mr. Watling seldom swore. [...] "Look at the President! There's a man of remarkable ability, too. And those two oughtn't to be fighting each other. The President's right, in a way. Yes, he is, though I've got to oppose him." ...|$|E
60|$|To the {{influence}} of the American Union must be added that of the British colonies. The success of popular self-government in these thriving communities is reacting on political opinion at home with a force that no statesman neglects, and that is every day increasing. There is even a danger that {{the influence}} may go too far. They are solving some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>problems,</b> but not under our conditions, and not in presence of the same difficulties. Still the effect of colonial prosperity--a prosperity alike of admirable achievement and boundless promise--is irresistible. It imparts a freedom, an elasticity, an expansiveness, to English political notions, and gives our people a confidence in free institutions and popular government, which they would never have drawn from the most eloquent assumptions of speculative system-mongers, nor from any other source whatever, save practical experience carefully observed and rationally interpreted. This native and independent rationality in men is what the jealous votary of the historic method places far too low.|$|E
