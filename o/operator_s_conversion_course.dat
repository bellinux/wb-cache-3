40|$|The {{reaction}} parameters of H 2 <b>S</b> <b>conversion,</b> H 2 yield and SO 2 selectivity obtained by thermal decomposition of H 2 S in presence of oxygen {{have been investigated}} at different operating conditions such as O 2 /H 2 S molar feed ratio, residence time and reaction temperature. Experimental tests allowed {{to find the best}} values of operating parameters able to assure a high H 2 <b>S</b> <b>conversion</b> and a good hydrogen yield, minimizing the SO 2 selectivity. The increase of the O 2 concentration has determined an increase of the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>conversion</b> and the SO 2 selectivity and a slight decrease of H 2 yield. The increase of the temperature in the range 700 - 1, 100 °C has improved the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>conversion</b> and H 2 yield, with a reduction of SO 2 selectivity from about 30 % to 2 %.

Several of its instructors were US and Canadian pilots on exchange with the RAAF. In 2000, No.2 OCU joined Nos.76 and 79 Squadrons as part of No.78 Wing, which had been re-established as an operational training formation. As of 2005, the unit had a strength of between 12 and 14 instructors and ran three Hornet <b>conversion</b> <b>courses</b> and one fighter combat instructor course over two-year cycles. About six new Hornet pilots took part {{in each of the}} <b>conversion</b> <b>courses,</b> and the unit generally graduated 15 new Hornet pilots over each cycle. By 2007, No.2 OCU had returned to the aegis of No.81 Wing, under Air Combat Group.
