5|$|Later, Morales and Ramsey {{receive a}} report about a stolen car {{that matches the}} one from the Turner and Cook murders. While {{investigating}} a sand pit, they encounter the Phantom. Morales shoots at him but misses, causing him to run into the woods. The Phantom escapes by jumping past a moving train, but is shot in the leg. While the officers {{are waiting for the}} train to pass, the Phantom escapes. They continue their search, but never find him. Years later during the Christmas season of 1976, the film The Town That Dreaded Sundown premieres in Texarkana and the shoes of the Phantom are seen <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> standing in line.|$|E
5|$|The rank of {{each person}} was {{determined}} by how many divine generals they had at their disposal, and {{by the number of}} divine scriptures they had obtained. These divine generals were used to fight wandering demons that could bring misfortune or illness <b>on</b> <b>someone.</b> A person received their first general at the age of six years, and in subsequent ceremonies would be given more and generals and achieve a higher ranking until a full complement was achieved at the age of nineteen. Marriage would unite two sets of generals, thus giving a couple use of 150 divine generals. After marriage, further increases in ranking could only be achieved by religious achievement.|$|E
5|$|HMS Tiptoe (pennant number P332) was a British {{submarine}} of {{the third}} group of the T class. She was built by Vickers Armstrong, Barrow, and launched on 25 February 1944. She {{was one of two}} submarines named by Winston Churchill, and so far has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to be named Tiptoe. In 1955 she was involved in a collision with a coastal steamer whilst in Tromsø harbour. She was involved in escape trials off Malta in 1962, and the commanding officer was reprimanded in 1964 following an incident in the Firth of Clyde where she was run aground, and again in 1965 when she collided with HMS Yarmouth. Although originally named for the ability to sneak up <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> undetected, she maintained several links with ballet, including the Royal Ballet and ballet dancer Moira Shearer. She was scrapped in Portsmouth in 1975, while her anchor is on display in Blyth, Northumberland.|$|E

5|$|After their stint <b>on</b> <b>Someone</b> Like Me, Carey and Helford {{developed}} and produced the storyline for The Drew Carey Show. The sitcom revolved around a fictionalized version of Carey, {{as he took}} on the stresses of life and work with his group of childhood friends. The show premiered on September 13, 1995 on ABC. In his autobiography, Carey revealed his frustration with {{having to deal with}} censors and being unable to employ the off-color humor common in his stand-up routines. Carey initially earned $60,000 per episode in the first seasons, then renegotiated for $300,000. By the final season, he was earning $750,000 per episode. The show had high ratings for its first few seasons, but declining ratings and increasing production costs (around $3 million per episode) precipitated its cancellation. The program had a total of 233 episodes over its nine-year run, and Carey was one of four actors to appear in every episode. The show starred (in order of episode appearances) Carey, Diedrich Bader, Kathy Kinney, Ryan Stiles (all in every episode); Craig Ferguson (starring role in seasons 2–8 and guest appearances in 9); Christa Miller (seasons 1–7); and Ian Gomez (semi-regular from seasons 1–9) and John Carroll Lynch (semi-regular from seasons 3–9).|$|E

25|$|Like the Looney Tunes, {{the series}} {{makes use of}} cartoon {{violence}} (e.g. anvils falling <b>on</b> <b>someone,</b> liberal use of explosives) and slapstick. The series parodies and references the current events of the early 1990s and Hollywood culture. Occasionally, episodes delve into veiled ethical and morality stories of ecology, self-esteem, and crime.|$|E

25|$|Some {{city and}} state {{officials}} have simply sought to remove slums.

25|$|If {{we accept}} this theory, the {{emergence}} of speech becomes theoretically impossible. Communication of this kind just cannot evolve. The problem is that words are cheap. Nothing about their acoustic features can reassure listeners that they are genuine and not fakes. Any strategy of reliance <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> else's tongue— perhaps the most flexible organ in the body— presupposes unprecedented levels of honesty and trust. To date, Darwinian thinkers have {{found it difficult to}} explain the requisite levels of community-wide cooperation and trust.|$|E
25|$|The most {{plausible}} {{suggestion is}} that having women read the Torah affronts communal “dignity” {{because they are not}} generally members of the obligated public community. Relying <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> who is not usually—and in the case of Torah reading, not at all—a member of the public community suggests that the regular members were either unable or chose not to shoulder their communal responsibilities (out of ignorance or apathy). Outsourcing obligations betrays an undignified attitude toward the obligation itself; educating future members of the congregation does not.|$|E

25|$|All legal {{procedures}} concerned with probate (as defined above) come within {{the jurisdiction of}} the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice by virtue of Section 25 of the Senior Courts Act 1981. The High Court is, therefore, the only body able to issue documents that confer <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> the ability to deal with a deceased person's estate—close bank accounts or sell property. It is the production and issuing of these documents, known collectively as grants of representation, that is the primary function of the Probate Registries, which are part of the High Court, which the general public and probate professionals alike apply to for grants of representation.|$|E
25|$|An 1899 {{reproduction}} of the Lincoln Imp also overlooked the Front Quad of Lincoln College, Oxford until 2000 when it {{was transferred to the}} bar (Deep Hall) and another Imp was erected in the traditional position above the entrance to Hall. This has given rise to a traditional Oxford expression: 'to look <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> like the Imp looks over Lincoln' as well as giving rise to the title of the college's undergraduate newspaper: The Lincoln Imp. The Lincoln Imp is also the mascot of the college boat club, an image of which is used to decorate the oars and jerseys of the men's 1st VIII.|$|E
25|$|Time Platform - One of Doctor Doom's most ingenious creations is this {{functioning}} time machine. It {{consists of}} a platform 10 feet (3.0m) by 10 feet (3.0m) by 6 inches (150mm) and a separate control console. Subjects stand upon the platform, while an operator works the controls. The device can transport characters to virtually any time and place in Earth's timestream, and the operator can instantly return the travelers by manipulating the control console. Doctor Doom {{does not require the}} console to return to his own time—he can use the time-circuitry built into his own armor, allowing him to venture into time and return on his own without relying <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> to bring him back.|$|E

He was fascinated by the stage, learning everything from set construction to stage production, and embarrassed by his acting ability. When he received the lead in Merton of the Movies, he realized the beauty of acting as a profession, as it allowed him to deflect attention from his own tongue-tied personality and create stage characters relying <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> else's scripted words. Fonda decided to quit his job and go east in 1928 to seek his fortune.|$|E
25|$|Most nudists and naturist clubs {{consider}} it essential {{for reasons of}} hygiene {{to sit on a}} towel whenever sitting on a chair, bench, or any other place where others might sit (unless under water) and they {{consider it}} poor etiquette to do otherwise. Some clubs encourage members or guests to bring their own chairs. Likewise, sitting <b>on</b> <b>someone</b> else's towel is considered a breach of etiquette. Similar rules may also apply to clothing-optional bike rides. Often in situations involving shared use of pools or tubs people are asked to shower first to minimize contamination and prolong the amount of time the water can be used before further maintenance is needed. This practice is also common in non-nudist pools.|$|E

Susan deals with being a single mother and having a new romance with her painter, while Mike starts dating Katherine.
