50|$|One of {{the studies}} {{suggests}} that to a large degree, {{the heads of the}} agencies are responsible for setting the tone for their organization, influencing the culture and agendas of the institutions, establishing the agencies’ mission and purpose. As they have so much influence on what the agency does, studies were done to see how different groups (race/ethnicity, sex) place importance on values or an agenda compared to others. The values that the agency heads hold regarding organizational objectives and goals are integral for them defining their jobs as state executives. The studies of 93 different state agencies found that there are differences between the attitudes and values of different ethnic groups, men, and women. Each group places different emphasis of importance on series of different characteristics of the organization. According to the studies, as a group, nonwhites placed more of an emphasis on goals of growing the <b>organization</b> <b>and</b> <b>budget</b> stability, and women placed greater emphasis on values pertaining to organizational proficiency.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} providing policy <b>and</b> <b>budget</b> oversight of Ukrainian intelligence organizations in accordance with norms and practices developed in contemporary Western democracies. As Ukraine continues the process of democratic consolidation, the issue of intelligence oversight remains vital, to ensure political accountability and financial efficiency. Oversight of intelligence {{is also important to}} the political initiatives Ukraine has undertaken to improve ties to NATO and the EU. Official government documents, news reports and other literature on the intelligence system in Ukraine, as well as studies of intelligence oversight within democracies are the primary sources of data. This thesis reviews the principles and problems involved in parliamentary and executive oversight of intelligence in western and transitional democracies. It details the <b>organizations</b> <b>and</b> <b>budgets</b> of the Ukrainian intelligence agencies, as well as the legislative and executive systems for providing financial resources to them and for conducting oversight of them. The most important problems identified include the needs to separate intelligence functions from security and lawenforcement tasks within Ukrainian intelligence organizations, create an all-source intelligence analysis agency and establish independent and well-staffed bodies in legislative and executive branches dealing exclusively with intelligence <b>and</b> intelligence <b>budget</b> oversight functions.

Many consider it as a “mature” technique, with few possibilities of advancement and as a physically and mentally stressful activity (high number of requests, continuous “clinical” attention while performing the studies, direct contact with patients). Clinical Directors of Radiology Departments have <b>organization</b> <b>and</b> <b>budget</b> concerns about US: it is an examination technique which is difficult to standardise and consumes considerable human resources (even when performed by a sonographer the physician must be nearby, and “medical time” is costly); CTs and MRs are requested also after US performed by clinicians, and these examinations ensure higher income to the Department. CT and MR often have higher sensitivity and always have wider capabilities: it is commonly thought that the examination technique which, in theory, provides the best results “in one stop” is the best choice.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{data on the}} facilities, <b>organization,</b> <b>and</b> <b>budget</b> of {{a sample}} of 755 senior centers from 31 states. The large majority of these centers report being located in one-story facilities that do not seriously limit their operation. The majority of centers make no direct payment for their facilities, and are subunits of larger, multi-site organizations. Some regional variations on these characteristics are uncovered, but size of place differentials are stronger and more consistent with centers in rural areas reporting smaller facilities and budgets. Journal of Applied Gerontology, 1984, Vol. 3, No. 2, 192 - 205 The senior center has become {{an important component of}} the community based service delivery system for the elderly. Funded by both the private and public sectors (National Council on the Aging, 1975), the development and growth of senior centers have been significantly accelerated by the passage of the Older Americans Act in 1965 and its subsequent amendments (Estes, 1980). Indeed, a 1974 national survey designed to compile a comprehensive listing of senior centers, clubs, and groups identified approximately 2, 500 senior centers (National Council on the Aging, 1975), quite an increase from the 400 identified in 196 ~ (Beattie, 1976). More recently, the U. S. Senate Special Committee on Aging (1979) has estimated that there are 5, 000 senior centers in this country.

40|$|This project aims {{to give a}} {{comprehensive}} explanation of Costa Rican action and rhetoric in foreign affairs, considering the challenges facing them and the Central American Region. The project has explained Costa Rican international relations at different levels. Firstly, the analysis explored the link between domestic and regional challenges facing Costa Rica, and their branding as a peace-loving country. This has been achieved by researching social statistical material regarding the region, such as the homicide rates, the numbers of civilian firearms and the numbers of armed conflicts, and was supplemented by {{an investigation of the}} <b>organization</b> <b>and</b> <b>budget</b> of the Costa Rican police force. Secondly, the project has analyzed Costa Rica’s role in the military de-escalation of Central America, based on Paul Collier’s empirical findings of indicators of regional cooperation on military de-escalation. Furthermore, there was an emphasis on how reciprocity in interdependency is made harder by the rooted tension between Costa Rica and their neighbor Nicaragua, and by the region’s history of turmoil and violence. Lastly, the focus shifted towards how Costa Rica’s options in foreign policy were, and still are intrinsically connected to the international power constellations. The project thus stressed that US hegemony can be seen to have had a great influence over the strategies chosen by Costa Rica, and that hegemony can well be manifested in the economic realm. Furthermore, Costa Rica’s trade and diplomatic relationship to the People’s Republic of China is another foreign policy aspect which proves Costa Rican band-wagoning strategies and the fact that liberal discourses of the Human Security paradigm are secondary to the realities of financial self-interest and national security...|$|E

The purpose of the plan of action, called "a leap for the future," is to serve as a catalyst for teacher training institutes, elementary and secondary schools, and universities to work together on a common goal: improving teaching and learning through the application of ICT. This report consists of seven chapters. The first chapter is an introduction to the initiative to revitalize teacher training and the committee's activities. Chapter 2 describes an analysis of the transformation of society and consequences for learning in the future. Chapter 3 discusses key elements in the teaching and learning process. A conceptual model is presented which serves as a frame of reference for COMMITT. The role of ICT in teaching and learning is also discussed. Chapter 4 outlines the scope of COMMITT and provides examples illustrating the impact of ICT as a medium for education.

40|$|This {{literature}} review focuses on substitution-related innovations {{in the nursing}} care of chronic patients in six western industrialized countries. Differences between primary and secondary care-orientated countries {{in the kind of}} innovations implemented are discussed. Health care systems are increasingly being confronted with chronic patients who need complex interventions tailored to their individual needs. However, it seems that today's health care professionals, <b>organizations</b> <b>and</b> <b>budgets</b> are not sufficiently prepared to provide this kind of care. As a result, health care policy in many countries targets innovations which reduce health care costs and, at the same time, improve the quality of care. Frequently, these innovations are related directly to the 'substitution of care' phenomenon, in which care is provided by the most appropriate professional at the lowest cast level, and encompass advanced nursing practice, hospital-at-home care and integrated care. The main conclusion of this paper is that integrated care innovations are implemented in both primary care as well as in secondary care-orientated countries. However, innovations in hospital-at-home care and advanced nursing practice are primarly implemented in primary care-orientated countries. Whether these innovations positively influence the quality of care, costs of care or patients' use of health care facilities remains rather unclear. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|Corbett, James J. This {{dissertation}} {{evaluates the}} governance, policy, and economics of improved water {{quality in the}} Delaware Basin, an interstate watershed in Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The watershed or river basin approach is examined {{as a means to}} manage the water resources of interstate river systems. The <b>organization</b> <b>and</b> <b>budget</b> structure of the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) is compared to other prototypical institutional models of interstate river basin management in the United States. A benefit-cost analysis is applied that employs a watershed pollutant load model to estimate market and nonmarket benefits, marginal abatement cost curves, and net benefits to determine optimal costs of water quality improvements to meet a more protective year-round fishable standard in the Delaware River. Results show that the annual benefits of improved water quality to achieve a future dissolved oxygen standard of 5. 0 mg/l in the Delaware River range from $ 370 million to $ 1. 06 billion at an annual pollutant load reduction cost of $ 449 million. The most cost effective DO water quality standard is 4. 5 mg/l defined by the intersection of the marginal benefits (MB) and marginal cost (MC) curves or the point where willingness to pay (WTP) for improved water quality equals the marginal costs of pollution reduction. This optimal criteria (4. 5 mg/) can be achieved within a cost range of $ 150 to $ 350 million with benefits that range from $ 150 to $ 950 million per year. Market-based mechanisms such as user-polluter pays approaches and water quality trading are explored as alternatives to traditional Clean Water Act regulations to incentivize and fund Delaware River water quality improvements. This research concludes that the DRBC has the requisite authority under a Federal/state compact to manage the Delaware River as a single entity and has the capability to tap beneficiary-pays revenue streams to fund water quality programs in an interstate basin that supplies drinking water to 5 {{percent of the population of}} the United States.

40|$|Sponsored search advertising, where search {{providers}} allow advertisers {{to participate}} in a real-time auction and compete for ad slots on search engine results pages (SERPs), is currently {{one of the most popular}} advertising channels by marketers. Some domains such as Amazon. com allocate in millions of dollars a month to their sponsored search campaigns. Considering the amount of money allocated to sponsored search as well as the dynamic nature of keyword advertising process, the campaign budget planning decision is a non-trivial task for advertisers. Budget constrained advertisers must consider a number of factors when deciding how to organize campaigns, how much budget to allocate to them, and which keywords to bid on. Specifically, they must decide how to spend budget across planning horizons, markets, campaigns, and ad groups. In this thesis, I develop a simulation model that integrates the issues of keyword segmentation, campaign <b>organization,</b> <b>and</b> <b>budget</b> allocation in order to characterize different budget allocation strategies and understand their implications on search advertising performance. Using the buying funnel model as the basis of keyword segmentation and campaign organization, I examine several budget allocation strategies (i. e., search Volume-based, Cost-based, and Clicks-based) and evaluate their performance implications for firms that may pursue different marketing objectives based on industry and or product/service offerings. I evaluate the simulation model using four fortune 500 companies as cases and their keyword advertising data obtained from Spyfu. com. The results and statistical analysis shows significant improvements in budget utilization using the above-mentioned allocation strategies over a Baseline strategy commonly used in practice. The study offers a unique insight into the budget allocation problem in sponsored search advertising by leveraging a theoretical framework for keyword segmentation, campaign management, and performance evaluation. It also provides insights for advertiser on operational issues such as keyword categorization and campaign organization and prioritization for improved performance. The proposed simulation model also contributes a valid experimental environment to test further decision scenarios, theoretical frameworks, and campaign allocation strategies in sponsored search advertising...|$|E
