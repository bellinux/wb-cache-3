5000|$|Similar to indium, gallium and gallium-containing alloys {{have the}} ability to wet to many {{non-metallic}} surfaces such as glass and quartz. Gently rubbing the alloy into the surface may help induce wetting. However, this observation of [...] "wetting by rubbing into glass surface" [...] has created a widely spread misconception that the gallium-based liquid metals wet glass surfaces, as if the liquid breaks free of the <b>oxide</b> <b>skin</b> and wets the surface. The reality is the opposite: the oxide makes the liquid wet the glass. In more details: as the liquid is rubbed into and spread onto the glass surface, the liquid oxidizes and coats the glass with a thin layer of oxide (solid) residues, on which the liquid metal wets. In other words, what is seen is a gallium-based liquid metal wetting its solid oxide, not glass. Apparently, the above misconception was caused by the super-fast oxidation of the liquid gallium in even a trace amount of oxygen, i.e., nobody observed the true behavior of a liquid gallium on glass, until research at the UCLA debunked the above myth by testing Galinstan, a gallium-based alloy that is liquid at room temperature, in an oxygen-free environment.

A high-speed camera captured the change in the spreading droplet 2 ̆ 019 s geometry, while thermocouples, inserted inside the substrate, allowed a heat transfer analysis to be performed. Droplet spreading factors and interfacial heat fluxes were then used to respectively characterize dynamic wetting and heat transfer for the various experimental conditions explored. These were: 1) effects of chemical composition of the aluminum alloy, 2) initial temperature of the substrate, 3) surface roughness of the substrate and 4) composition of the gaseous atmosphere. The experiments were all carried out in gaseous atmospheres containing oxygen in sufficient amount to form <b>oxide</b> <b>skins</b> at the surface of the droplets and the substrates. The results showed instances where an improvement in the dynamic wetting was accompanied by an increase in heat transfer during the early stages of solidification but this was not systematic.

40|$|Liquid metals exhibit {{remarkable}} mechanical properties, {{in particular}} large surface tension and low viscosity. However, these properties are greatly affected by oxidation {{when exposed to}} air. We measure the viscosity, surface tension, and contact angle of gallium (Ga) and a eutectic gallium-indium alloy (eGaIn) while controlling such oxidation by surrounding the metal with an acid bath of variable concentration. Rheometry measurements reveal a yield stress directly attributable to an <b>oxide</b> <b>skin</b> that obscures the intrinsic behavior of the liquid metals. We demonstrate how the intrinsic viscosity can be obtained with precision through a scaling technique that collapses low- and high-Reynolds number data.

Nitric <b>oxide</b> treated <b>skin</b> showed significant increases in cells expressing CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 68, neutrophil elastase, ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1, nitrosotyrosine, p 53, and apoptotic cells compared with skin treated with ascorbic acid alone.

40|$|The gaseous {{free radical}} nitric oxide is an {{important}} biologic mediator with physiologic and pathophysiologic roles in nearly every organ system. Because of its unique biologic activity, unusual chemical structure, and unprecedented mechanisms of action, nitric oxide, arguably {{more than any other}} natural product, has opened new avenues to investigate cellular processes. Nitric oxide is generated in biologic tissues by specific nitric oxide synthases that metabolize arginine and molecular oxygen to citrulline and nitric oxide.

Recent progress has allowed the identification of the nitric oxide pathway in several cell types that reside in the skin, including keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells.

In particular, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus is the dominant allergen for asthma. We cross-sectionally investigated the relationships among respiratory symptoms and function, airway inflammation, allergen sensitization, and indoor allergen concentration. Methods: One hundred and thirty-two children aging 10 - 14 years {{and living in a}} Southern Mediterranean area were evaluated by parental questionnaires. Spirometry, exhaled nitric <b>oxide</b> (FeNO), <b>skin</b> prick tests, total, and specific serum IgE analyses were performed along with the evaluation of home dust samples for the content in Der p 1 allergen. Three clusters were created {{on the basis of the}} presence/absence of wheeze in the last 12 months (Wh 12 m) and Der p 1 -specific IgE level. Results: Cluster 1 (Wh 12 m+/high Der p 1 IgE) presented higher FeNO and poorer pulmonary function (lower FEV 1 and FEF 25 %- 75 %), while its symptom score was not different from Cluster 2 (Wh 12 m+/low Der p 1 IgE). Cluster 3 (Wh 12 m-/low IgE) showed the lowest FeNO values and pulmonary function similar to Cluster 2. Within Cluster 1, both Der p 1 -specific IgE and FeNO were positively correlated with dust Der p 1. Conclusions: Similar asthma phenotypes may occur in children despite differences in their atopic state. In atopic children, sensitizing allergens in the indoor environment may increase airway inflammation worsening pulmonary function. Moreover, environmental exposures may contribute to the development of asthma-like symptoms also in the absence of atopic sensitization, thus contributing to asthma overdiagnosis...|$|R

Results: Fifty women (mean age ± standard deviation of 32 ± 5 years) were enrolled over an 11 -month period and examined on average 4  months postpartum. During pregnancy, 13 women had a total of 16 exacerbations (8 mild and 8 severe).

Although the protective effect of CpG-containing immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides is clearly dependent on endogenous interleukin- 12 and interferon-γ production, {{the source of}} these Th 1 -promoting cytokines in infected mice is unknown. In contrast to macrophages from Leishmania-resistant C 57 BL/ 6 mice, macrophages from susceptible BALB/c mice are hyporesponsive to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ. While studying interactions of various antigen-presenting cells with Leishmania, we found that BALB/c inflammatory skin macrophages, whether Leishmania-infected or uninfected, produced large amounts of interleukin- 12 when treated with CpG-containing immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides. Like lipopolysaccharide, CpG-containing immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides induced production of interferon-γ and release of nitric <b>oxide</b> by <b>skin</b> macrophages. Studies using skin macrophages from interleukin- 12 - and interferon-γ-deficient BALB/c mice demonstrated that nitric oxide release was not dependent on interleukin- 12 and interferon-γ production. Approximately 44 % and 27 % of intracellular Leishmania major amastigotes were killed by infected skin macrophages within 72 h upon stimulation with CpG-containing immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides and lipopolysaccharide, respectively. Parasite killing by macrophages was independent of endogenous interferon-γ production, but was strongly enhanced by exogenous interferon-γ. Parasite elimination was dependent on the induction of nitric oxide, however. In vivo, injection of CpG-containing immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides into lesional skin reduced the parasite burden ≈ 50 -fold within the first 5 d of infection prior to full generation of a Th response. These results suggest that skin macrophages, constituting the principal reservoir of parasites in infected susceptible mice, produce Th 1 -promoting cytokines in response to CpG-containing immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides. In addition, CpG-containing immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides may also act locally on skin macrophages to facilitate Leishmania clearance by inducing nitric oxide production...|$|R

Aim: To identify factors associated with variation in serum ECP and to determine the relative proportion of the variation in ECP due to genetic and non-genetic factors, in an adult twin sample. Methods: A sample of 575 twins, selected through a proband with self-reported asthma, had serum ECP, lung function, airway responsiveness to methacholine, exhaled nitric <b>oxide,</b> and <b>skin</b> test reactivity, measured. Linear regression analysis and variance component models were used to study factors associated with variation in ECP and the relative genetic influence on ECP levels. Results: Sex (regression coefficient = - 0. 107, P < 0. 001), body mass index (BMI) (0. 007, P = 0. 028), and airway responsiveness to methacholine (0. 074, P = 0. 001) were significantly associated with ECP. Adjusted for these factors, ECP correlated 0. 53 (P < 0. 001) and 0. 27 (P = 0. 001) in monozygotic and dizygotic twins, respectively (P-value for difference = 0. 05). According to the most parsimonious variance component model, genetic factors accounted for 57 % (CI: 42 - 72 %, P < 0. 001) of the variance in ECP levels, whereas the remainder (43 %) was ascribable to non-shared environmental factors. The genetic correlation between ECP and airway responsiveness to methacholine was statistically non-significant (r = - 0. 11, P = 0. 50).

The functional residual capacity (FRC% predicted) (100. 9 ± 4. 21 vs 80. 40 ± 4. 03; P = 0. 009) and expiratory reserve volume (ERV% predicted) (95. 13 ± 6. 71 vs. 67. 03 ± 4. 54; P = 0. 001) both were significantly lower in the obese group. The non-obese and obese group had hs-CRP levels of 3. 01 mg/L and 4. 07 mg/L, respectively; the difference being statistically insignificant (P = 0. 15). Similarly, FE NO levels of non-obese and obese group were 63. 20 ppb and 63. 75 ppb, respectively; difference {{was not statistically significant}} (P = 0. 95). Atopic profile of both the groups did not differ significantly.

40|$|Cutaneous {{vascular}} conductance (CVC) {{increases in}} response to local skin heating. Although attenuation of vasoconstrictor responsiveness due to local heating has been demonstrated, the mechanism(s) responsible for this attenuation remains unclear. Nitric oxide {{has been shown to}} at least partially contribute to this response, but other mechanisms also may be involved. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that local heating diminishes cutaneous vasoconstrictor responsiveness through a nitric oxide-independent mechanism by altering postsynaptic reactivity to norepinephrine. A follow-up protocol tested the hypothesis that local heating attenuates the presynaptic release of neurotransmitters that cause vasoconstriction, also via non-nitric oxide mechanisms. In protocol I, CVC was assessed in eight subjects during administration of increasing doses of norepinephrine (via intradermal microdialysis) at adjacent sites separately heated to 34 °C and 40 °C. In protocol II, which was identical to, but separate from, protocol I, CVC was assessed in seven subjects during administration of increasing doses of tyramine, which causes release of neurotransmitters from adrenergic nerves. At each site for both protocols, nitric oxide synthesis was inhibited (via microdialysis administration of NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester) and flow was matched (via microdialysis administration of adenosine); therefore, temperature was the only variable that differed between the sites. For both protocols, nonlinear regression analysis revealed no difference (P > 0. 05) in the effective drug concentration causing 50 % of the vasoconstrictor response. Minimum CVC [6. 3 ± 2. 0 and 9. 0 ± 4. 0 % of peak CVC (mean ± SD) for protocol I and 19. 3 ± 9. 3 and 20. 5 ± 11. 9 % of peak CVC for protocol II at 34 °C and 40 °C sites, respectively] was not different between sites. Independent of nitric <b>oxide,</b> local <b>skin</b> heating to 40 °C does not attenuate adrenergically mediated cutaneous vasoconstriction through pre- or postsynaptic mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{nanoparticles}} {{has increased}} in consumer products in recent decades; however, concerns regarding their safety remain. Zinc oxide is used in sunblocking and may generate free radicals in response to UV illumination, leading to DNA damage and an immunological response. With high‐resolution, high‐contrast imaging in biological tissue, multiphoton microscopy is able to separate nanoparticles signals from endogenous fluorophores. It has been proven to be very useful in imaging penetration of zinc <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles in <b>skin</b> and in combination with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy study cellular function as well. This chapter aims to review {{the use of these}} imaging techniques in studying the uptake and distribution of nanoparticles in skin and liver. Due to the questionable clinical use and possible toxicity of nanoparticles, it is important to study their pharmacokinetics. Some nanomaterials have been identified as relatively toxic to humans and a few metal nanoparticles have been reported to penetrate and be detected in blood. Multiphoton microscopy has high resolution and is able to visualize nanoparticles, due to their optical properties, in vivo. The addition of fluorescence lifetime imaging makes it possible to measure the physiochemical environment, with outputs that can be statistically analyzed, posing an advantage over fluorescence intensity imaging only...|$|R
