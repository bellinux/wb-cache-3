This work emphasises {{on the study}} of the decomposition mechanism and compared with a single fire test in order to show its performance as flame retarded composite. As such, mass loss cone calorimetry tests were performed and compared with it inert and <b>oxidative</b> <b>decompositions</b> in lab tests. PVAc/MIC composites cannot be ignited with high loadings MIC. Difference curves in oxidative conditions revealed that the composites with MIC show only positive differences, indicating a high stabilisation, especially in the temperature region of a mild flame (500 – 700  °C). Experiments performed with TG coupled with mass spectroscopy and analyses on partially degraded residues with solid-state 13 C-NMR enabled the construction of the complete decomposition mechanism. MIC has both a heat-sink FR activity as well as a crosslinking role in the stabilization of the polymer. The latter then creates a highly stabilised char at elevated temperatures in oxidative environments. The formed char starts to degrade only 100  °C higher than the pure polymer within a heating. The degradation of formed char of pure PVAc is autocatalytic; this behaviour disappears upon addition of sufficient amount of MIC. Therefore, the transport of fuel towards the gaseous phase is limited, creating an efficient flame retardant system. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} study of the {{preparation}} and oxidation of a range of heterocyclic N-amino compounds. A review of N-aminating agents is given in the Introduction. 1, 2, 4 -Triazin- 3 (2 K) -ones gave imidazolin- 2 -ones when treated with hydroxylamine-o-sulfonic acid or 0 -(2, 4 -dinitrophenyl) hydroxyl- amine, probably via N-amino intermediates. However, chloramine gave 1, 2, 3 -triazoles by acting as an oxidising rather than an aminating agent. These reactions were extended to cinnolin- 3 (2 H) - one where the 2 -amino derivative could be isolated. Pyrolysis and oxidation of 2 -aminocinnolin- 3 (2 K) -one both lead to new rearrangements. l-Aminoquinoxalin- 2 (IH) -one, prepared by amination of quinoxalin- 2 (lK) -one, gave benzo-l, 2, 4 -triazine when oxidised by lead tetraacetate, as well as products derived by interception of the N-nitrene intermediates. Four 3 -substituted 1 -aminooxindoles were prepared by direct amination and by reduction of cinnolin- 3 (2 H) -ones and their different <b>oxidative</b> <b>decompositions</b> determined. The oxidation of N-amino-acetanilide was investigated for comparison. I-Amino- 3 -substituted benzimidazolin- 2 (lH) -ones were similarly studied; the corresponding tetrazenes and deaminated compounds were formed on oxidation and the N-nitrene intermediates could be intercepted with olefins or dimethyl sulfoxide. The unsubstituted l-aminobenzimidazolin- 2 (lH) -one gave 1 -acetylbenzotriazole, however, probably via benzo-l, 2, 4 -triazin- 3 (2 H) -one.

50|$|The {{chemical}} {{effects of}} moisture {{can be seen}} in the chalking of titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigmented coatings and polymers; the anatase form is particularly sensitive to wavelengths below about 405 nm while the rutile forms absorb energy above that wavelength. Chalking results from the degradation of the binding material resulting in a release of the TiO2 pigment particles. These particles form a dull layer on the surface which may be wiped off. Experience shows that chalking is strongest where more water is available on the surface; little to no chalking occurs in dry atmospheres. TiO2 is a semiconductor where electron transitions from the valence band to the conduction band result from the absorption of light at wavelengths in the near UV range, below 400 nm. Ultraviolet radiation causes electron-hole pairs to be created in the TiO2 lattice. These react with the hydroxide groups on the surface and the Ti4+ ions. Hydroxyl and perhydroxyl radicals are formed through the conversion of oxygen and a water molecule whereby the TiO2 surface again resumes the initial form and acts as a catalyst for continued activity, thus repeating the chalking cycle. The hydroxide and perhydroxyl radical then cause <b>oxidative</b> <b>decomposition</b> of the binder with the subsequent release of TiO2 particles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In Southeast Asia, a {{huge amount}} of peat has {{accumulated}} under swamp forests over millennia. Fires have been widely used for land clearing after timber extraction, thus land conversion and land management with logging and drainage are strongly associated with fire activity. During recent El Niño years, tropical peatlands have been severely fire-affected and peatland fires enlarged. To investigate the impact of peat fires on the regional and global carbon balances, it is crucial to assess not only direct carbon emissions through peat combustion but also <b>oxidative</b> peat <b>decomposition</b> after fires. However, there is little information on the carbon dynamics of tropical peat damaged by fires. Therefore, we continuously measured soil CO 2 efflux (RP) through <b>oxidative</b> peat <b>decomposition</b> using six automated chambers on a burnt peat area, from which about 0. 7 m of the upper peat had been lost during two fires, in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The RP showed a clear seasonal variation with higher values in the dry season. The RP increased logarithmically as groundwater level (GWL) lowered. Temperature sensitivity or Q 10 of RP decreased as GWL lowered, mainly because the vertical distribution of RP would shift downward with the expansion of an unsaturated soil zone. Although soil temperature at the burnt open area was higher than that in a near peat swamp forest, model simulation suggests that the effect of temperature rise on RP is small. Annual gap-filled RP was 382 ± 82 (the mean ± one standard deviation of six chambers) and 362 ± 74 gC m- 2 y- 1 in 2004 - 2005 and 2005 - 2006 years, respectively. Simulated RP showed a significant negative relationship with GWL on an annual basis, which suggests that every GWL lowering by 0. 1 m causes additional RP of 89 gC m- 2 y- 1. The RP accounted for 21 - 24 % of ecosystem respiration on an annual basis...|$|R

The experiments were performed on a bench type apparatus, under conditions representing both under and well-ventilated non-flaming fires. The analyses of gaseous species relied on Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and micro gas chromatography (μGC), resulting in the identification and quantification of 11 gaseous products; among them, phosgene, thiophosgene and hydrogen cyanide. Gas chromatography - quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-QMS) was employed to analyse the condensed products and volatile organic compounds (VOC), while a GC equipped with an ion trap mass spectrometer (GC-ITMS) was used to quantify polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F). The GC-QMS analysis determined several VOC toxicants; viz., trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, benzonitrile and chlorinated benzenes. At higher temperature (600 °C), the oxidation of captafol {{led to the formation of}} mono- to hepta- CDD/F congeners including the most toxic 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD.

It could be proven that the {{major part of the}} observed overall specific capacity loss (in total 36. 3 mA h g− 1) is reversible and induced by kinetic limitations, namely an impeded lithiation reaction during discharge. A measure facilitating the lithiation reaction, i. e. a constant potential (CP) step at the discharge cut-off potential, results in an increase in specific discharge capacity of 22. 1 mA h g− 1. This capacity increase during the CP step could be proven as a relithiation process by Li+ content determination in NCM via an ICP-OES measurement. In addition, a specific capacity loss of approx. 4. 2 mA h g− 1 could be determined as an intrinsic reaction to the NCM cathode material at room temperature (RT). In total, less than 10. 0 mA h g− 1 (= 28 % of the overall capacity loss) can be attributed to irreversible reactions, mainly to irreversible structural changes of NCM. Thus, the impact of parasitic reactions, such as <b>oxidative</b> electrolyte <b>decomposition,</b> on the irreversible capacity is negligible and could also be proven by on-line MS.

These acids can initiate degradation within the polymer itself and in neighbouring artefacts, of which organic and metal-based materials are particularly susceptible [7, 9, 19, 21]. Plasticized CN has a slower rate of decomposition than the pure CN polymer [12]. As outlined above degradation is facilitated by plasticizer migration {{and the presence of}} acid residues from original manufacture.

The peatland, however, has been rapidly degraded by deforestation, fires and drainage {{for the last two}} decades. Such disturbances change hydrological conditions, typically groundwater level (GWL), and accelerate <b>oxidative</b> peat <b>decomposition.</b> Evapotranspiration (ET) is a major determinant of GWL, whereas information on the ET of PSF is limited. Therefore, we measured ET using the eddy covariance technique for four to six years between 2002 and 2009, including El Niño and La Niña events, at three sites in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The sites were different in disturbance degree: a PSF with little drainage (UF), a heavily drained PSF (DF) and a drained burnt ex-PSF (DB); GWL was significantly lowered at DF, especially in the dry season. The ET showed a clear seasonal variation with a peak in the mid-dry season and a large decrease in the late dry season, mainly following seasonal variation in net radiation (Rn). The Rn drastically decreased with dense smoke from peat fires in the late dry season. Annual ET forced to close energy balance for four years was 1636 ± 53, 1553 ± 117 and 1374 ± 75 mm yr- 1 (mean ± 1 standard deviation), respectively, at UF, DF and DB. The undrained PSF (UF) had high and rather stable annual ET, independently of El Niño and La Niña events, in comparison with other tropical rainforests. The minimum monthly-mean GWL explained 80 % of interannual variation in ET for the forest sites (UF and DF); the positive relationship between ET and GWL indicates that drainage by a canal decreased ET at DF through lowering GWL. In addition, ET was decreased by 16 % at DB in comparison with UF chiefly because of vegetation loss through fires...|$|R
40|$|Lipid hydroperoxides are primary {{oxidation}} compounds {{formed in}} the beginning stages of oxidation and are associated with <b>oxidative</b> stress. Hydroperoxide <b>decomposition</b> also produces low-molecular-weight volatile compounds {{that are responsible for}} rancidity in foods. Therefore, the lipid hydroperoxide content is an important determinant in the evaluation of oxidative stress in biological samples and the quality of foods. However, the methods that rapidly determine hydroperoxides in biological samples and foods present various drawbacks such as lack of sensitivity or interferences while methods with greater sensitivity and selectivity require highly trained personnel and/or expensive instrumentation. In this frame, little attention has been devoted to the ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange method, which is based on the peroxide-mediated oxidation of ferrous ions in an acidic medium containing the dye xylenol orange which binds the resulting ferric ions to produce an orange-brown complex. This simple method can be affected by several factors such as the sample matrix, reagents, dye, reaction media, and time, so it has some drawbacks and limitations that need elucidation. These factors have been reviewed to overcome these problems and thus achieve a sensitive, reproducible, and selective method capable of measuring the lipid hydroperoxide content in different matrices...|$|R
