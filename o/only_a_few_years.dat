He served as legal counsel for Paul Hornung when Hornung was suspended for the 1963 National Football League season for gambling.

5|$|Due to the {{wholesale}} destruction of plants at the K–Pg boundary, {{there was a}} proliferation of saprotrophic organisms, such as fungi, {{that do not require}} photosynthesis and use nutrients from decaying vegetation. The dominance of fungal species lasted <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> while the atmosphere cleared and plenty of organic matter to feed on was present. Once the atmosphere cleared, photosynthetic organisms, such as ferns and other plants, returned.|$|E

On a charter to the New Minster at Winchester, the names of Ælfthryth and her son Æthelred appear ahead of Edward's name.

After <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> osmium {{was replaced by}} the more stable metal tungsten. Tungsten has the highest melting point among all metals, and its use in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of incandescent lamps.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1894 that Stroma gained its first {{artificial}} landing point, a pier built from Portland cement near Nethertown {{at a cost of}} £800. In 1955, Caithness County Council constructed a new harbour on the south coast of the island at the then great cost of £28,500. Although it was intended to help stem the exodus of people from the island, Stroma was abandoned <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> after the harbour's completion.|$|E

The building was vacated, boarded up, and virtually forgotten in 1929 as the Great Depression struck North Texas and office space became relatively inexpensive to lease or purchase. A fire gutted the building in 1931, rendering it unusable for a number of years.|$|E

5|$|Weather {{can have}} both {{beneficial}} and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as tornadoes or hurricanes and cyclones, can expend {{large amounts of}} energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.|$|E
5|$|After independence, the Darawishta {{merged with}} the former British Somaliland Scouts to form the 5,000 strong Somali National Army. The new military's first {{commander}} was Colonel Daud Abdulle Hirsi, a former officer in the British military administration's police force, the Somalia Gendarmerie. Officers were trained in the United Kingdom, Egypt and Italy. Despite {{the social and economic}} benefits associated with military service, the armed forces began to suffer chronic manpower shortages <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> after independence.|$|E
5|$|After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, {{the ship}} was used {{primarily}} to train gunners and engine room personnel, as the US Navy had expanded significantly to combat the German U-boat campaign. She escorted convoys in late 1918, {{and after the war}} ended she took part in the effort to bring American soldiers back from France. New Hampshire remained in service for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> after the war, as the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty significantly reduced the navies of the signatories; as a result, {{the ship was}} sold for scrap in November 1923.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{conflict}} both sides had exhausted their human and material resources. Consequently, they were vulnerable to the sudden emergence of the Islamic Rashidun Caliphate, whose forces invaded both empires <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> after the war. The Muslim forces swiftly conquered the entire Sasanian Empire and deprived the Byzantine Empire of its territories in the Levant, the Caucasus, Egypt, and North Africa. Over the following centuries, half the Byzantine Empire and the entire Sasanian Empire came under Muslim rule.|$|E
5|$|Commissioned <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, the ships had limited service careers. All three of the battleships conducted training cruises in the Mediterranean Sea in 1912. In 1913, they took part in an international naval demonstration in the Ionian Sea that protested the Balkan Wars. After Italy declared war on Austro-Hungary and the other Central Powers in 1915, the three Radetzky-class ships bombarded coastal targets in the Adriatic Sea. After 1915, {{their participation in the}} war became minimal. All three ships were handed over to Italy {{after the end of the}} war, and broken up for scrap between 1920 and 1926.|$|E
5|$|Gorgosaurus {{spent as}} much as half its life in the {{juvenile}} phase before ballooning up to near-maximum size in <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> This, along with the complete lack of predators intermediate in size between huge adult tyrannosaurids and other small theropods, suggests that these niches may have been filled by juvenile tyrannosaurids. This pattern is seen in modern Komodo dragons, whose hatchlings start off as tree-dwelling insectivores and slowly mature into massive apex predators capable of taking down large vertebrates. Other tyrannosaurids, including Albertosaurus, have been found in aggregations that some have suggested to represent mixed-age packs, but {{there is no evidence of}} gregarious behavior in Gorgosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Priestley {{founded the}} Theological Repository in 1768, a journal {{committed}} to the open and rational inquiry of theological questions. Although he promised to print any contribution, only like-minded authors submitted articles. He was therefore obliged to provide much of the journal's content himself (this material {{became the basis for}} many of his later theological and metaphysical works). After <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> {{due to a lack of}} funds, he was forced to cease publishing the journal. He revived it in 1784 with similar results.|$|E

In 1930, sulfide deposits were discovered in the Moncha area; in 1932–1933 iron ore deposits were found near the upper streams of the Iona River; and in 1935, significant deposits of titanium ores were discovered {{in the area of}} modern Afrikanda.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparition}} of 12BC {{was recorded}} in the Book of Han by Chinese astronomers of the Han Dynasty who tracked it from August through October. It passed within 0.16AU of Earth. Halley's appearance in 12BC, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> distant from the conventionally assigned date {{of the birth of}} Jesus Christ, has led some theologians and astronomers to suggest that it might explain the biblical story of the Star of Bethlehem. There are other explanations for the phenomenon, such as planetary conjunctions, and there are also records of other comets that appeared closer to the date of Jesus' birth.|$|E

5|$|The {{expense of}} {{resources}} during the RomanPersian Wars ultimately proved catastrophic for both empires. The prolonged and escalating warfare of the 6th and 7th centuries left them exhausted and vulnerable {{in the face}} of the sudden emergence and expansion of the Caliphate, whose forces invaded both empires <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> after the end of the last RomanPersian war. Benefiting from their weakened condition, the Arab Muslim armies swiftly conquered the entire Sasanian Empire, and deprived the Eastern Roman Empire of its territories in the Levant, the Caucasus, Egypt, and the rest of North Africa. Over the following centuries, more of the Eastern Roman Empire came under Muslim rule.|$|E

They saw action at the major engagements, including Heligoland Bight and Dogger Bank, though neither ship was present at Jutland. Both ships survived the war; Strassburg was surrendered to Italy and renamed Taranto. She served through World War II and was sunk by Allied bombers in 1944. Stralsund became the French Mulhouse, though she served for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> and was withdrawn from service by 1925 and scrapped a decade later.|$|E
