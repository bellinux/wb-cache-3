"Candyman" [...] is a pop and R song; Stylus Magazine's Thomas Inskeep {{opined that}} it imitated swing music, while Joan Anderman from The Boston Globe commented that Perry and Aguilera {{attempted}} to modernize early 20th century pop and blues [...] "only {{to end up}} imitating the Andrews Sisters," [...] and Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani characterized the song as standard jazz and blues.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} and explains the recent rise of "big-box" general merchandisers. Data from the Census of Retail Trade for 1977 - 2007 show that general-merchandise chains grew {{much faster than}} specialist retail chains, and that general merchandisers that added the most stores also made the biggest increases to their product offerings. We explain these facts with a stylized model in which a retailer’s scale economies interact with consumer gains from <b>one-stop</b> <b>shopping</b> to generate a complementarity between a retailer’s scale and scope.

40|$|We analyze how {{consumer}} preferences for <b>one-stop</b> <b>shopping</b> affect the (Nash) bargaining relationships between a retailer and its suppliers. <b>One-stop</b> <b>shopping</b> preferences create 'demand complementarities' among otherwise independent products {{which lead to}} two opposing effects on upstream merger incentives: first a standard double mark-up problem and second a bargaining effect. The former creates merger incentives while the later induces suppliers to bargain separately. When buyer power becomes large enough, then suppliers stay separated which raises final good prices. We also show that our result can be obtained when wholesale prices are determined in a non-cooperative game, under two-part tariffs and when products are substitutable. September 201...|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{a spatial}} {{differentiation}} model with divisible consumption under <b>one-stop</b> <b>shopping.</b> Each consumer who visits only one store, chooses the quantities {{of the goods}} which maximize his/her utility function under the budget constraint (namely consumption expenditures must equal income minus transportation costs), choosing the store which provides him/her with the largest indirect utility. We derive the equilibrium price when the firms are located at the two extremities of Hotelling's linear city and show that income increases have a pro-competitive effect. Equilibrium prices are indeed decreasing with consumers' income and increasing with the transportation cost. They converge to marginal costs as income goes to infinity or the transportation cost goes to zero. However the analysis does not amount to a story of weight of transportation cost relative to income. Equilibrium profits do not change {{in the same way}} as the transportation cost decreases or the income increases. They do not tend toward the same limit as the income tends to infinity or the transportation cost tends to zero. Finally the <b>one-stop</b> <b>shopping</b> assumption is discussed. It is mainly proved that it may emerge endogenously. Spatial differentiation Divisible consumption Transportation cost Income effect <b>One-stop</b> <b>shopping...</b>|$|R
