5000|$|An <b>optional</b> <b>heading</b> {{containing}} {{control information}} can precede {{data in a}} frame. The content of the heading is not defined by the protocol but is defined for each specific device. The heading, if present, is preceded by an SOH (start of heading) character and followed by an STX (start of text). [...] Text data normally follows the heading, begun by the STX, and terminated by ETX (end of text) or ETB (end transmission block).|$|E
40|$|A vision-based {{automatic}} tracking and observation system installed on an ROV has successfully tracked midwater ocean animals (such as jellyfish) in Monterey Bay, California. This system uses stereo vision to localize the tracking vehicle {{with respect to}} the target of interest and closes control loops to maintain the target in the views of the cameras. The vision and control algorithms have been reported previously. This paper documents the partial redesign of the system in response to issues identified during extensive field testing of the system. The sensing system has been redesigned with the specific objectives of improving initialization, achieving better robustness to disturbances, and enabling tracking of smaller specimens. All of these improvements are achieved by redesigning the stereo camera system to increase significantly the volume that is viewable by both cameras. Also, an <b>optional</b> <b>heading</b> control loop now augments the control architecture to prevent sustained clocking of the vehicle due to disturbances in the tracking control system’s null space. With these design improvements, the {{automatic tracking}} and observation system has been fielded as a pilot aid on the ROV Ventana, and has proven capable of tracking specimens that vary widely in size, appearance and behavior. ...|$|E

However, it is normally considered a special dress item, worn for public relations events or parades. An embroidered goldwork cap badge representing the JGSDF logo identical to the one used on the service dress peaked cap is required by regulation to be affixed to the beret.|$|R
2500|$|For 1991, the Grand Prix Turbo coupe was {{replaced}} by a new GTP version. This model sported a 3.4L DOHC V6 that produced [...] with a five-speed manual transmission or 200 with the optional four-speed automatic. Inside, the GTP was essentially the same as the Turbo. One notable exception was the available <b>optional</b> <b>Heads</b> Up Display only shared with the Cutlass Supreme. The exterior used mini-quad headlamps (along with all other Grand Prix coupes), [...] "GTP Grand Prix" [...] and [...] "24 Valve V6" [...] badges. The STE Turbo {{was replaced}} by a 3.4L STE and could be ordered with the automatic transmission or manual transmission. For the SE coupe, the B4U package featured GTP bodywork and aluminum wheels. An SE sedan also became available, and featured STE-like styling at a lower price. The LE coupe was discontinued for 1991.|$|R
50|$|Jaguar had {{considered}} cutting the V12 in half {{to build a}} V6, or possibly a V8, but chose instead {{to develop a new}} inline-6. The cylinders are inclined, as in a slant-6, by 22 degrees. It uses an aluminum block to reduce weight, and has an <b>optional</b> DOHC <b>head</b> for higher efficiency and power.|$|R
50|$|An <b>optional</b> {{cylinder}} <b>head</b> for the Venom {{became available}} for racers in 1964; a Venom equipped with this revised cylinder head took first in its class at that year's Thruxton 500, a 500 mi endurance road race. Veloce introduced the Venom Thruxton production model in 1965 with an advertised 41 horsepower at the crankshaft. Period tests clocked it at 110 mph without race tuning.|$|R
50|$|A unique item {{offered by}} Mossberg for the Model 500 {{is a line}} {{launcher}} kit. It uses special blank cartridge to propel a shaft with an <b>optional</b> floating <b>head</b> and a light rope attached to it; a canister hung below the barrel {{to hold the line}} spool. A test of the Mossberg 500 with line launcher by the BoatUS Foundation showed an average range of over 330 ft with the floating head. Distances of 700 ft are claimed for the non-floating long distance head.|$|R

5000|$|To {{successfully}} {{account for}} the syntactic structure of a nominal sentence, there must either be {{a change in the}} phrase structure rules or a zero copula must be assumed. This is because nominal sentences cannot be accounted for using traditional phrase structure rules, which state: TP → {NP/ CP} (T) (VP). In other words, a tense phrase must consist of a noun phrase or complementizer phrase, an <b>optional</b> tense <b>head,</b> and a verb phrase. Less technically, this means each sentence must have a noun and verb component. Because there is no overt verb in a nominal sentence, this creates a challenge for the theory.|$|R
50|$|The Austin A40 Somerset saloon's {{reputation}} for being somewhat slow and lumbering to drive is not wholly deserved. It had to endure poor-quality petrol supplies in 1952, and in consequence had retarded ignition settings to tolerate the low octane rating of the fuels available to avoid the engine knocking or 'pinging' condition that was well known in those times. In fact British Motor Corporation later produced a kit to improve the performance and fuel consumption of these cars once premium fuel supplies resumed under the popular petrol brands. This kit comprised a replacement distributor and an <b>optional</b> cylinder <b>head</b> gasket that was thinner and therefore raised the compression slightly from the standard 7.2:1.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{argued that}} {{relative}} clauses in Japanese are IPs, {{contrary to the}} proposal that they are CPs headed by a null complementizer. I assumed {{that the lack of}} CP is responsible for the inapplicability of embedded topicalization in relative clauses and clausal adnominal modifiers in Japanese, and concluded that whenever they have a complementizer, it must be overt. I also showed that null complementizers must be licensed by an adjacent verb or noun, and demonstrated that relative clauses in Japanese do not have a null complementizer, based on the observation that they need not be adjacent to the head noun. Hence, I proposed that NGC is a result of Agree between a nominal element D and the embedded subject. Also, in order to answer the question why NGC is possible under Agree Closest and why it is blocked when a complementizer appears overtly, I referred to an analysis where the <b>optional</b> T-to-D <b>head</b> movement plays an important role. Under this analysis, the head movement feeds the Agree relation, but it is blocked when C is intervening between T and D. ...|$|R

5000|$|... 2015 Armed & Dangerous:"Don't let {{the cover}} art of Don Alder's Armed & Dangerous CD throw you. It {{pays homage to}} the cast of The Walking Dead TV series and {{features}} a trench-coated zombie slayer armed with a fan fret acoustic guitar equipped with <b>optional</b> <b>head</b> stock blade, body blade, variable angle chainsaw and a flame thrower whammy bar. Scary as that might be, musically there is nothing dead about this vibrant collection of 12 original compositions. In fact, the only scary thing here is that Alder's infectious fretwork will leave an indelible imprint in your musical memory. The highly accoladed Alder has attained more fret-cred than, perhaps any other fingerstylist {{over the past eight}} or nine years, yet there is no sense that he has any intention of resting on his laurels if this often energetic and engaging CD is any indication. Much like his last release, Not a Planet, Alder offers a variety of sonic flavors and styles with technique and execution that are precise and so very fluid. There is an improvisational feel to the performances on Armed & Dangerous that create an immediacy that is fast becoming an Alder trademark. [...] "Going Rogue" [...] opens the CD with a deceptively intricate and eloquent intro before sliding, literally and sonically, head long in a tasty, yet funky grove that burst continually in unexpected melodic directions - as if the fret board of Alder's baritone guitar were a roller coaster and his fingers were alternately delighted, thrilled and hanging on for dear life. Before you have time to recover from the opening track, Alder lets loose [...] "Love & Life," [...] perhaps the most beautiful and satisfying vocal tunes he has ever penned, complete with full band accompaniment and violins that heighten the melody and Alder's spot on vocals. If I weren't for the phenomenal guitar work throughout this album, [...] "Love & Life," [...] would be my favorite track. As he has proven before, the man can flat-out sing! [...] "Dancing with Spin Doctors," [...] adds a whole new aspect to Alder's repertoire. He lays down and electric finger-style groove with help from Billy Sheehan on bass and Sam Cartwright on drums that has Eric Johnson-esque overtones and feels completely at home nestled in amongst the acoustic bulk of this collection. For sheer beauty both [...] "Sophrosyne" [...] and [...] "Precious Moments" [...] show the delicate side of Alder's fretwork as he coaxes sweetness from a baritone guitar that I haven't heard since Pat Metheny's One Quiet Night. Other highlights include [...] "Circuitous," [...] a fingerstyle gem and the spirited [...] "Three Good Reasons To Play," [...] a duet written and with Luca Francioso. Not surprisingly, the release of Armed & Dangerous coincides with Don Alder's name appearing on the cover of Guitar Player Magazine. Go figure..." [...] James Filkins ...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of particles like ke in modern Persian {{varies according to}} context. As a morphosyntactic element {{with a range of}} roles, it func-tions as a subordinator, an adverbial conjunction, a focus marker and an interrogative word. Ke is most frequent in subordinate clauses, and the majority of Persian grammars discuss {{it in the context of}} complex sentences. Though almost every Persian grammar deals with ke, obli-gatory, optional and contrastive occurrences of this particle remain to be investigated. Predicting such occurrences is the goal of this article. With relative clauses ke is <b>optional</b> provided the <b>head</b> N P is followed by pronouns like ance 'that, which'; otherwise it is obligatory. With content clauses the head NP is obligatorily followed by ke, whereas the head NP is optionally followed by it. As a temporal element ke is always obligatory; as a focus marker and a temporal element it is always con-trastive. Besides the above roles, some residual cases are discussed: as a complementizer of minor clauses ke is obligatory; in response to a statement of warning ke is optionally used. 1...|$|R
50|$|In April 2002 for the 2003 model year, {{the chassis}} was again {{redesigned}} with hydroformed steel. The {{front and rear}} suspension were also completely overhauled. New inverted monotube shocks were now used (replacing the old twin-tube shocks {{that had been used}} since the 1960s). In the front, new aluminum control arms, and rack and pinion steering (replacing the recirculating ball units) have been implemented. The rear suspension was redesigned for durability in police-duty applications and the rear shocks were moved outboard of the frame rails for better handling and ease of maintenance. As a result, the road-handling manners of the Panther platform cars had improved significantly. The engine output increased due to the addition of a knock sensor for more aggressive timing. This brought up horsepower ratings to 224 HP for single-exhaust models and 239 HP for dual exhaust and police models. 2003 models also received <b>optional</b> seat-mounted combination <b>head</b> and torso side airbags. The interior was also modestly refreshed for the 2003 model year, with changes to the door panels and seats.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1998 model year, a {{gasoline}} engine was offered, a Mitsubishi derived 4G64 [...] at 5,250 rpm with 218 Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm. The diesel engine now {{comes with a}} slightly more powerful Mitsubishi derived 4D56 non-intercooled turbo diesel engine with [...] at 201 Nm at 2,000 rpm. Available in two trim levels, SVX and Club, {{and a number of}} body styles (commercial panel van, and pick up (Libero)). A long wheelbase (12-seater) [...] "Jumbo" [...] and short wheelbase (seven- and nine-seater) [...] "RV" [...] was also available. First introduced to this model are luxurious features like side lower body cladding with two-tone paint scheme (SVX, Club), optional dual sunroof (Club), side body [...] "Tetris style" [...] decals (Club), chrome slant grills, rear tailgate handle opener cover (Club), cream moquette upholstery (Club), <b>optional</b> high-tech <b>head</b> unit with television screen and six-disc CD changer (Club) for domestic models, power windows and antenna (SVX, Club) an Aisin Seiki Co. sourced four-speed automatic transmission with ECT and overdrive switch and differently styled [...] "star" [...] 15-inch alloy wheels with exposed lug nuts (Club). For safety, it also features limited-slip differential (LSD), anti-lock braking system (ABS) and driver side airbag. This models was exported to a number countries and proved a big hit to some car markets like the Philippines where at that time was imported via gray market. It gained instant popularity for comfortable sedan-like drive, availability of automatic transmission, expansive interior space and thickly bolstered seats. Its main advantage was being priced lower than its twin, the Mitsubishi Delica Space Gear, yet it packed more features and factory accessories like front bull bars, top basket loader, and a rear ladder. For the following year in the Philippines, the gasoline engine version was dropped due to unusually high gasoline consumption, but still made available for other markets.|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{describe}} realizations of Damascene Arabic (DA) intonation contours {{with regard to}} four syntactic categories: declaratives, continuatives, yes/no-questions and wh-questions. The study used the British nuclear framework, describing the nucleus and three <b>optional</b> elements (pre-head, <b>head</b> and tail). Contours were transcribed using INSTINT (Hirst & Di Cristo, 1998) 1. The speech material was collected from two Damascene informants who read a series of prompts. Utterances were chosen from the collected data to represent {{a wide range of}} possible realizations {{for each of the four}} syntactic categories. Analysis of contour elements was then conducted with Praat version 4. 4. 16 (Boersma & Weenink, 2006). Declaratives showed global downdrift 2, with stressed syllables higher and unstressed syllables lower. Declaratives exhibited a prehead with mid pitch, falls on the nuclei, and utterance final fall in the tail. Certain stressed non-nuclear syllables were particularly prominent and showed a large F 0 change. Unusual realizations included a curving rise-fall pattern in the head and tail, as well as a local final rise to sustained Mid in the tail. Continuatives followed a global rising pattern throughout the utterance. Continuatives usually showed a great rise at the first stressed syllable, followed by Low in the middle of the utterance, endin...|$|R
40|$|We {{obtained}} spectra for two {{giants of}} Crater (Crater J 113613 - 105227 and Crater J 113615 - 105244) using X-Shooter at the VLT. The spectra have been analysed with the MyGIsFoS code using {{a grid of}} synthetic spectra computed from one dimensional, Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) model atmospheres. Effective temperature and surface gravity have been derived from photometry measured from images obtained by the Dark Energy Survey. The radial velocities are 144. 3 +- 4. 0 km/s for Crater J 113613 - 105227 and and 134. 1 +- 4. 0 km/s for Crater J 113615 - 105244. The metallicities are [Fe/H]=- 1. 73 and [Fe/H]=- 1. 67, respectively. Beside the iron abundance we could determine abundances for nine elements: Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Ni and Ba. For Na and Ba we took into account deviations from LTE, since the corrections are significant. The abundance ratios are similar in the two stars and resemble those of Galactic stars of the same metallicity. On the deep photometric images we could detect several stars that lie to {{the blue of the}} turn-off. conclusions <b>heading</b> (<b>optional),</b> leave it empty if necessary The radial velocities imply that both stars are members of the Crater stellar system. The difference in velocity between the two taken at face value, implies a velocity dispersion > 3. 7 km/s at 95 % confidence level. Our spectroscopic metallicities are in excellent agreement with that determined by previous investigations using photometry. Our deep photometry and the spectroscopic metallicity imply an age of 7 Gyr for the main population of the system. The stars to the blue of the turn-off can be interpreted as a younger population, of the same metallicity and an age of 2. 2 Gyr. Finally, spatial and kinematical parameters support the idea that this system is associated to the galaxies Leo~IV and Leo~V. All the observations favour the interpretation of Crater as a dwarf galaxy. (Abridged). Comment: Submitted to A&A Letters on April 21, 2015, Accepted June 9, 201...|$|R
