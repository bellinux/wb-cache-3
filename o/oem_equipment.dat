40|$|Abstract: Liquid phase {{injection}} {{technology is}} the key point in overcoming most of the traditional problems of LPG engines, related both to their low capability in {{air to fuel ratio}} control, and to the sensible power decrease with respect to analogous gasoline inducted IC engines. Anyway, the introduction of this technology in <b>OEM</b> <b>equipments</b> is still limited, being subjected to the overcoming of some relevant problems about liquid phase maintenance inside the fuel system, and to the so called "hot start delay " phenomenon. This work, through a comprehensive analysis of the dynamical behaviour of the injection system, individuates a solution able to enhance liquid phase control, while reducing hot start delay. 1...|$|R
50|$|Another 3-inch (75 mm) format was Mitsumi's Quick Disk format. The Quick Disk {{format is}} {{referred}} to in various size references: 2.8-inch, 3-inch×3-inch and 3-inch×4-inch. Mitsumi offered this as <b>OEM</b> <b>equipment,</b> expecting their VAR customers to customize the packaging for their own particular use; disks thus vary in storage capacity and casing size. The Quick Disk uses a 2.8-inch magnetic media, break-off write-protection tabs (one for each side), and contains a see-through hole near center spindle (used to ensure spindle clamping). Nintendo packaged the 2.8-inch magnetic media in a 3-inch×4-inch housing, while others packaged the same media in a 3 inch×3 inch square housing.|$|E

50|$|After divestiture, January 1, 1984, American Telephone & Telegraph was {{required}} to put its computer business into a fully separated subsidiary called AT&T Information Systems (ATTIS, without the ampersand or hyphen). Software was developed in New Jersey locations (Murray Hill, Summit, Holmdel, and Piscataway), and software, hardware, and system solutions were developed in Naperville and Lisle, IL. After a couple years of court hearings, AT&T was allowed to pull the business back into the mainstream corporate organization, and it was renamed AT&T Data Systems Group, consisting of 3 divisions: Computer, Terminals (the Teletype Corporation of Skokie, IL), and Printers. In 1991, the AT&T Data Systems Group, with the three divisions was announced to the public.

40|$|Our overall {{purpose in}} writing {{this series of}} {{articles}} is to provide Federal energy managers some basic informational tools to assist their decision making process relative to energy management systems design, specification, procurement, and energy savings potential. Since Federal buildings rely on energy management systems more than their commercial counterparts, {{it is important for}} energy practitioners to have a high level of knowledge and understanding of these complex systems. This is the second article in a series and will focus on building control system (BCS) networking fundamentals and an assessment of current approaches to open communications protocols. This is important because networking is a complex subject and the networks form the basic infrastructure for energy management functions and for integrating a wide variety of <b>OEM</b> <b>equipment</b> into a complete EMCIS. The first article [1] covered enabling technologies for emerging energy management systems. Future topics will concentrate on more practical aspects including applications software, product offerings, networking strategies, and case studies of actual installations.
