According to the President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform report, which compared the individual and corporate income tax (excluding other taxes the FairTax replaces) to a sales tax with rebate, the percentage of federal taxes paid by those earning from $15,000–$50,000 would rise from 3.6% to 6.7%, while the burden on those earning more than $200,000 would fall from 53.5% to 45.9%. [...] The report states that the top 5% of earners would see their burden decrease from 58.6% to 37.4%. FairTax supporters argue that replacing the regressive payroll tax (a 15.3% total tax not included in the Tax Panel study; payroll taxes include a 12.4% Social Security tax on wages up to $97,500 and a 2.9% Medicare tax, a 15.3% total tax that is often split between employee and employer) greatly changes the tax distribution, and that the FairTax would relieve the tax burden on middle-class workers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} ideas of Brennan and Buchanan (1977, 1978, 1980) to local {{property}} taxes. When local governments maximize their revenues, property taxes provide incentives for adequate amenity provision. Local amenity provision determines property values which then determine local tax revenues. As long as the demand for housing is inelastic, property-taxes will provide stronger incentives for local governments than lump-sum taxes. As current property values reflect expectations about future amenity levels, property taxes create incentives {{for even the most}} myopic government to invest for the future. Local property taxes can also act to limit the incentives of localities to tax; there are cases where higher levels of local property taxes lead to lower <b>overall</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burdens.</b> These ideas are applied to the tax reform in the late 1970 s; one reason that tax reform may have been so successful is that in a period where land prices are driven by many forces other than government amenities, property taxes lose their value as incentive devices. ...|$|R

Roger Porter, another architect of the program, acknowledges that the program was weakened by the many hands that changed the President's calculus, such as Congress.

2500|$|Wilson's {{government}} made {{a variety of}} changes to the tax system. Largely {{under the influence of}} the Hungarian-born economists Nicholas Kaldor and Thomas Balogh, an idiosyncratic Selective Employment Tax (SET) was introduced that was designed to tax employment in the service sectors while subsidising employment in manufacturing. (The rationale proposed by its economist authors derived largely from claims about potential economies of scale and technological progress, but Wilson in his memoirs stressed the tax's revenue-raising potential.) The SET did not long survive the return of a Conservative government. Of longer-term significance, Capital Gains Tax (CGT) was introduced across the UK on 6 April 1965. Across his two periods in office, Wilson presided over significant increases in the <b>overall</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> in the UK. In 1974, three weeks after forming a new government, Wilson's new chancellor Denis Healey partially reversed the 1971 reduction in the top rate of tax from 90% to 75%, increasing it to 83% in his first budget, which came into law in April 1974. This applied to incomes over £20,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ),, and combined with a 15% surcharge on 'un-earned' income (investments and dividends) could add to a 98% marginal rate of personal income tax. In 1974, as many as 750,000 people were liable to pay the top-rate of income tax. Labour's identification with high tax rates was to prove one of the issues that helped the Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher and John Major dominate British politics during the 1980s and early-to-mid-1990s.|$|E

40|$|Within the EU the {{relation}} between financial and tax accounting will be significantly influenced by the regulation adopted in June 2002 that obliges all listed companies to prepare their consolidated accounts according to International Accounting Standards / International Financial Reporting Standards (IAS/IFRS). Since dependency of financial and tax accounting according to different degrees prevails in all EU member states a linkage between IAS/IFRS and tax accounting seems to be possible. Compared to national GAAP the advantage of IAS/IFRS {{as a starting point}} for tax accounting derives from the advantages of the creation of a common tax base in the EU. However, the adoption of IAS/IFRS has to be restricted to those standards that are convenient for tax purposes. In particular, this means that tax accounting still has to follow the realisation principle as a general principle; the IAS/IFRS "fair value-accounting" therefore cannot be adopted for tax purposes. In this paper we present estimates for the consequences of IAS/IFRS-based tax accounting on the comparative effective <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> of companies in 13 countries (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, and the USA). Therefore, certain provisions of IAS/IFRS were considered {{as a starting point for}} the tax base. The effective <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> are calculated on the basis of the European Tax Analyzer model which was enhanced for the purposes of this study. A further question arises as to what extent an exclusive harmonisation of the tax base will effectively reduce the current EU-wide differences of effective company <b>tax</b> <b>burdens.</b> It turns out that a common tax base cannot alleviate the current EU-wide differences of effective company <b>tax</b> <b>burdens.</b> A major finding of our study reveals that the effective <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> in all countries considered here (except Ireland) tend to increase slightly since the tax bases tend to become broader. This offers the possibility to member states to reduce the nominal tax rate leaving the <b>overall</b> effective <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> unchanged. A <b>tax</b> policy of tax cut cum base broadening would not only tend to increase the attractiveness of the member states as a location for companies. At the same time, this would reduce dispersions of effective <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> across industries. Therefore, such a tax policy is in line of the long term Community goals to become more competitive in international terms...|$|R
40|$|Multinational {{companies}} {{have the opportunity}} to apply profit shifting strategies to reduce their tax payments in high-tax countries and minimize the <b>overall</b> effective <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> on their global profits.

Specifically, this report presents the cost of capital (CoC) and the effective average tax rates (EATR) for cross-border investments between the 28 EU member states and the US distinguishing between scenarios that involve seven different tax planning strategies. The calculations are based on tax law data for the year 2015. The tax planning strategies considered use different forms of profit shifting via interest and royalty payments.

The elderly population is growing rapidly and life expectancy continues to increase, lengthening periods of retirement.

30|$|The {{results from}} model (3) of Table  5 {{suggest that the}} <b>overall</b> {{relationship}} between <b>tax</b> progressivity and revenue volatility is weak and even counterintuitive. Higher <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> {{at the very top}} of the income distribution do increase the potential fiscal risk from recession in those states where income at the top is very volatile. However, empirically the actual effect is small on average, because most states with high exposure at the top do not impose high <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> on that group. The three states with the highest burdens on the top 5 percent -- California, New York, and New Jersey -- also had very large negative income shocks, due to the concentration of income and -- in California and New York -- large shares of capital gains at the top; but they are exceptional cases. Most states with large income shocks to the top 5 percent have below-average <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> on this group, which reduces the impact on tax revenues. Moreover, in the next 15 percent of the distribution, higher <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> are associated with reduced revenue volatility at the mean income shock. Thus higher burdens in the top 20 percent of the income distribution, which are associated with a less regressive tax structure, did not increase <b>overall</b> <b>tax</b> volatility during the Great Recession.|$|R

Similar results are obtained if the budget deficit is included to measure the long-run <b>tax</b> <b>burden.</b> In the past when the budget was close to balance, the <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> was slightly lower than today and spending was much lower. When the <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> rose above average, governments took significant decisions to alleviate the burden, not stand by {{and allow it to}} increase.

Tax hikes because of tax avoidance would have the largest impact on businesses who pay the most tax and leave the largest tax avoiders unaffected, while actually exacerbating the incentives for avoidance. The structural budget balance shows that the current budget balance and (probably) tax levels are due to government decisions not the state of the economy. Revenue writedowns have major problems: this measure reflects forecasting errors more than anything else and deferring to this measure would lead to large tax increases in recessions.
