40|$|In {{unconsolidated sediments}} subject to strain, clays and silts are realigned into {{particular}} optical birefringent arrangements (<b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics),</b> which {{provide information on}} the style and intensity of sediment deformation. A relatively new, non-destructive, optical microscopy technique for automatically recording and quantifying birefringence (previously commercialized under the name ‘Metripol’) is pioneered in this study as a valuable and innovative micromorphological tool with which to examine deformation in unconsolidated sediments. Metripol is applied to unistrial <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabric</b> in glaciotectonized and ice keel scoured sediment from the Netherlands and former Glacial Lake Agassiz (Manitoba, Canada) respectively. Colour-coded images are produced in which colour represents relative optical retardation and thus optical anisotropy through the quantity |sinδ| and optical orientation of anisotropy through the angleØ(also indicated by linear azimuths). In this study Metripol typically demonstrates that the better developed the unistrial <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabric</b> is, the higher the |sinδ| values, the larger the areas of high |sinδ| values, and the longer and more densely populated the azimuths. In addition, some unistrial <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics</b> under Metripol demonstrate lower |sinδ| than previous examples and the surrounding sediment, despite being ‘perceived’ as demonstrating higher birefringence under a standard petrographic microscope. This is particularly true in clay-rich sediments and has implications for the way we currently describe and interpret unistrial <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics</b> in unconsolidated sediment. Finally, the identification and quantification of additional structures that would otherwise have gone undetected using a standard petrographic microscope (e. g. linear and circular structures {{that are likely to}} represent discrete shears and skelsepic <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabric,</b> respectively) highlight the potential for Metripol to gather information on the deformation history of unconsolidated sediments that is unavailable to standard techniques...|$|R

40|$|Microscopic {{oriented}} clay bodies {{known as}} plasma separations to soil micromorphologists show {{various degrees of}} symmetry and regularity in their patterns. They could be regarded as sensitive and reliable indicators of stress-strain regime of a soil. Empirical and experimental evidence signifies the importance of stress, specifically that generated by in situ swelling, in the genesis of <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Hitherto, most work in this field is confined to geometric characterization, with limited attempts to dynamic interpretations of their origin. This paper enlists appropriate concepts in soil mechanics, structural geology and agricultural engineering to interpret the possible stress-strain components that rearrange fabric units into plasma separations. Some pertinent concepts, including physico-chemical behaviour of the clay-water system, shrink-swell phenomenon, stress-strain, deformation and failure of soil, are employed to explain the origin of <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics</b> by mechanical principles. A conceptual model is suggested to synthesize the conditions, changes and consequences related {{to the formation of}} <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Strongly developed plasma separations in natural soils are attributed to the establishment of an anisotropic state of stress generated by in situ swelling, in conjunction with the passive pressure of lateral confinement and vertical overburden. The difference between the maximum and minimum principal stresses produces a deviatoric stress that can, at certain stages of a shrink-swell cycle, exceed the shear strength of the soil. The extra stress is relieved plastically by shear deformation which is manifested as the alignment of platy particles in domain configuration by rotation and translation along the shear planes. Soil mainly fails in compressive (plastic) mode along a large number of small shear planes which form the plasma separations. The formation of different types of sepic <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics</b> is discussed in relation to the stress-strain regimes of soils. © 1990. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This {{experimental}} study examines {{the relationship between}} texture and microfabric under isotropic stresses generated by wetting and drying. This {{can be achieved by}} observing and measuring the reorganization of microfabrics (<b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics</b> and related distribution pattern, RDP). Microfabrics are produced in the laboratory by mixing montmorillonite with various proportions of sand and silt, and subjecting them to wetting and drying without confinement. Thin sections are cut to study their microfabrics. Results show broad and systematic variations in fabric with changes in texture. Fine matrix (silt plus clay in physical continuity) is developed in samples with low sand:silt ratio, and regardless of this ratio at high clay levels. Coarse porphyric and fine porphyric RDP are formed at low and high clay contents, respectively. <b>Plasmic</b> <b>fabrics</b> are represented mainly by insepic and weakly developed mosepic and masepic fabrics in the matrix in the form of small plasma separations with random orientation, and weak skelsepic plasma as embedded grain argillans. On the other hand, coarse matrix (sand grains in physical continuity) dominates the sandy samples which are associated with relatively thick and strongly birefringent free grain argillans giving well-developed skelsepic fabric. The RDP follows two major paths: beginning with orthogranic (very low clay content) along the iunctic sequence at low clay:silt ratio and along the chlamydic sequence at high ratio. The regularities in fabric development are interpreted {{in the light of the}} dynamic properties and behaviour of the active clay fraction in a clay-water system. The pedogenetic implications of the results are explored, and the term "erdic" fabric defined. © 1984. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The microstructures present (folds, faults, <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics)</b> within this diamicton and underlying predominantly sandy sediments are interpreted in terms of sedimentary processes active during emplacement of the debris flow. These processes include the formation of a basal shear zone, the deformation and mixing of fine-grained sediments incorporated into the base of overriding debris flow. Features associated with liquefaction, sediment remobilisation and water escape are also present and developed in response to increasing overburden pressure during debris flow emplacement. These microstructures have also been recorded elsewhere within subglacial diamictons, and an evaluation is made between microstructures in palaeo debris flow deposits and those found in modern debris flows...|$|R

40|$|Thin {{sections}} of impregnated samples {{were used for}} micromorphological analysis of the ‘Ricker Hills Tillite’ in southern Victoria Land, Antarctica. The tillite is composed of massive matrix-supported diamicton with a porphyric coarse/fine related distribution, low sorting, low rounding and medium to high angularity. Glacial deposits are completely represented by lodgement till. Phyllosilicate reorientation patterns (<b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics)</b> are visible in most samples, especially associated skelsepic and lattisepic patterns. Syndepositional pervasive till shearing (glacially induced) is evidenced by clast alignments, shear planes, rotational structures and pressure shadows. Boudinage, ductile shear zones, and rotational structures are also widespread in the deformed bedrock. Water-escape structures are clearly evident in the tillite and in the bedrock. Shear planes infilled by injection veins in lodgement till and at the till-bedrock interface testify {{to the presence of}} water during deposition. Secondary features like clay and silt coatings, sparite calcite, and oxidation products were found in all the examined outcrops. They formed under phreatic conditions due to saturated water circulation. A warm-based ice sheet was responsible for the deposition of the tillite.

40|$|The Chuos Formation is a diamictite-dominated {{succession}} of Cryogenian age, variously {{interpreted as the}} product of glaciomarine deposition, glacially related mass movement, or rift-related sediment remobilisation in a non-glacial environment. These interpretations have wide ranging implications for the extent of ice cover during the supposedly pan-global Neoproterozoic icehouse. In the Otavi Mountainland, northern Namibia, detailed analysis of soft-sediment deformation structures on the macro- and micro-scale support glacitectonic derivation in response to overriding ice from the south/south-east. Overall, the upward increase in strain intensity, predominance of ductile deformation features (e. g. asymmetric folds, rotational turbates and necking structures, clast boudinage, unistrial <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics)</b> and pervasive glacitectonic lamination support subglacial deformation under high and sustained porewater pressures. In contrast, soft-sediment structures indicative of mass movements, including flow noses, tile structures, and basal shear zones, are not present. The close association of subglacial deformation, abundant ice-rafted debris and ice-contact fan deposits indicate subaqueous deposition in an ice-proximal setting, subject to secondary subglacial deformation during oscillation of the ice margin. These structures thus reveal evidence of dynamic grounded ice sheets in the Neoproterozoic, demonstrating their key palaeoclimatic significance within ancient sedimentary successions. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} study examines the micromorphological changes resulting from confined swelling and shrinking of aggregated samples. Two factors, namely bulk density (two levels) and sample composition (five levels) were considered. Thin sections were cut and the microfabrics studied in detail both qualitatively and quantitatively. A {{broad range of}} significant and systematic microfabric changes were observed. With {{an increase in the}} activity and content of the clay fraction, the void volume (especially those > 30 μm) decreased drastically whereas the shape changed from compound packing voids to occluded planar voids and vughs. Aggregates were flattened at contacts, became more angular and showed evidence of fusion into compound units. Related distribution patterns were altered from dominantly matrigranic to matrigranoidic, fragmoidic and porphyric with scattered vughs. There was a gradual closing of voids and a concomitant coalescence of aggregates. <b>Plasmic</b> <b>fabrics</b> showed mainly an increase in long (> 10 μm) and narrow (< 5 μm) but sharply defined plasma separations. High bulk density resulted in a more vigorous and conspicuous expression of fabric unit deformation and movement.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Chemostratigraphic methods (d 13 Corg) for {{pinpointing}} the Permian–Triassic boundary in nonmarine {{rocks of}} Antarctica, Austra-lia, and South Africa have drawn attention to unusual claystone brec-cias at this horizon {{of the greatest}} extinction {{in the history of}} life on Earth. These rocks differ from other breccias in having a high pro-portion of clasts with birefringence microfabrics (sepic <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics)</b> characteristic of soils, and can be called sepic pedoliths in the termi-nology of soil science. At many localities, earliest Triassic sepic pedol-iths are thin (5 – 15 cm) beds, but some fill shallow paleochannels, and pinch out laterally. Other non-marine breccias at the Permian–Triassic boundary are dominated by fragments of coal, pedogenic carbonate nodules, and deeply weathered volcanic rock fragments. Earliest Tri-assic sepic pedoliths record an unusually severe and widespread epi-sode of soil erosion associated with forest dieback at the Permian– Triassic boundary. Comparable sepic pedoliths are found in debris flows after clear-cutting of forests in western Oregon today. Studies of these modern deposits show that sepic soil peds do not withstand weathering {{for more than a few}} months. Such clayey clasts are held together mainly by roots and fungi, which decay rapidly in soils and streams. These modern analogs demonstrate that terminal Permian soil erosion was rapid and profound. Sepic pedoliths are also known at other times of mass extinction, such as the Triassic–Jurassic boundary, but are not yet known before the Devonian advent of trees and forested clayey soils...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} whether till grain size affects {{the range and}} {{occurrence}} of micromorphological features associated with subglacial shear. Our till samples were collected from two glaciers in Iceland, and varied in texture from a coarse, sandy clast-rich till (Fjallsjökull) to a fine-grained silty-sandy till (Vestari-Hagafellsjökull). We found {{a wide range of}} deformational microstructures that included skelsepic <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabric,</b> intraclasts of pre-existing eroded bedrock (basalt) and weathered clay and ‘mini-shear zones’ between clasts. We classified our micromorphological data into three classes; rotational, intermediate and linear. In addition to these observations, we performed extensive microfabric analysis at different scales on all of our samples. We found that the coarse-grained till contained a greater number and variety of microstructures than the fine-grained till. In addition, the fine-grained till showed a distinct lack of rotational structures that we attribute to the lack of significantly sized clasts in the matrix. We argue that the varied texture of the coarse-grained till provides a greater degree of perturbation within the shearing layer and so more distinct microstructures form. In a more fine-grained till, shearing is more homogeneous since there are less perturbations in the matrix and this leads to a more singular kind of microstructure. Our observations suggest that subglacial shear occurs within a multi-layered patchwork of different grain sizes, competence and pore water pressures. It is these factors that are so crucial in determining the occurrence and type of microstructural evidence we see in subglacial tills...|$|R
40|$|The Holocene {{coastal plain}} of Suriname is a chenier plain. Its actual sedimentological {{development}} has been studied during three field-work periods (1966, 1967 / 1968, 1972). Clay is the predominant sediment in this low- to medium-energy environment. It accumulates in extensive shoreface-attached mudflats (sometimes considered as giant mudwaves), which migrate continuously to the west due to deposition of slingmud at their west side and simultaneous erosion of the east side. In between the mudflats cheniers may develop. Thin-section analysis of the clay deposits revealed that they are built up of an alternation of thick clayey laminae and thin laminae of silt and fine sand. The clayey laminae chiefly show a unistrial <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabric.</b> Disturbaces in the upper zone are caused by bioturbation. Two types of cheniers can be distinguished. One type contains fine sand which has been winnowed out of the pelite deposits. Since this sand is brought from the shelf the chenier formation begins at approximately mean low-water level. Longshore bars are formed and these are driven shoreward by wave action. The other type is built up of medium to coarse sand supplied by a local river. It is transported westward by beachdrift in a narrow zone around the mean high-water line. These cheniers develop therefore at or just above the mean high-tide level. The sedimentary structures of both types of cheniers have many characteristics in common. However, each type also has its own distinct features...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Egypt {{soils are}} {{generally}} characterized by slightly alkaline to alkaline pH values which are mainly {{due to its}} dry environment. Under such aridic conditions, the occurrence of acid soils is considered an anomalous, and interesting to be studied. Three acid soil profiles, located at El-Wahat El-Bahrya, Giza Governorate, Egypt were investigated for this study. The field description indicated the occurrence of common iron oxides, jarosite and clay-iron cutans. Except the Ap horizon of profile 3, all the pH values of the studied soils were acidic and ranged between 3. 63 to 5. 15, which is mainly considered due to the oxidation of pyrite that was formed during an old more humid period. The chemical analysis assured the presence of exchangeable acidity and low cation exchange capacity due to the dominance of kaolinite clay mineral. The results were confirmed by the x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope examinations, which indicated the dominance of kaolinite clay minerals {{and the presence of}} ferric oxides and jarosite. Both skell-ferriargillans and the undulic <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabric</b> were identified by the micromorphological inspection confirming the formation of kandic horizon in the studied soils. The soils are classified mainly as “Typic Haplosalids and "Plinthic Kandiudalfs”. All the soils have kandic horizons that were pedologically developed on ferruginous sandstone materials during different paleo-environments and were preserved under the recent arid conditions within which some salic horizons are formed. The suitability of the studied soils for irrigated agriculture was evaluated as S 2 and S 3 classes. Integrated environmental management is recommended for the area to conserve soils from the irruptive degradation that occur mainly due to the mismanagement activities...|$|R
40|$|A semi-lithified to lithified diamicton, the "Ricker Hills Tillite", {{outcrops}} {{in places}} under a discontinuous Late Pleistocene glacial drift on the homonymous nunatak in the Prince Albert Mts, to the South of David Glacier. The geomorphologic {{evolution of the}} area, the sedimentary facies, and the fabric of glacial deposits have been reconstructed through detailed geomorphologic and glacial-geologic surveys. The tillite has been described and sampled to investigate the dynamic of the glacier responsible of its deposition. Micromorphological description and petrographic analyses {{have been carried out}} on thin sections of impregnated samples. X-ray diffractometry and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry have been performed to determine the clay fraction mineralogical composition and the chemical composition of bulk rocks. The diamictite is generally massive, with a porphiric-related distribution, low sorting, low rounding and medium to high angularity. Chemical analyses indicate that samples derive from mixing of the Ferrar Group dolerites and the Beacon Supergroup sandstones. High smectite and kaolinite contents (from 47 % to 78 % and from 16 % to 34 %, respectively) characterize the clay minerals composition; illite and chlorite occur in minor amount. Deformation structures induced by glacial stress are visible in glacial deposits and in bedrock samples collected {{at the base of the}} tillite. Phyllosilicate reorientation patterns (<b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics)</b> due to glacial stress are clearly visible. The morphological and compositional characteristics of this deposit indicate that an ice mass advanced on the Ricker Hills and deposited a glacial drift in climatic conditions warmer than present, with a diffused availability of water during deposition. Finally, the tillite experienced a continental weathering in wet condition with percolating water, as testified by illuviation features, by calcite infillings, and by the formation of clay minerals typical of temperate climates...|$|R
40|$|Although {{integrated}} clast macro and microfabric {{studies have}} been used to provide evidence of palaeo-ice flow directions, to discriminate between diamictons deposited in differing sedimentary environments, and to model the response of tills to subglacial deformation, such studies have typically only examined the ‘bulk’ fabric developed within the diamicton, largely ignoring the potential for several phases of fabric development within these typically polydeformed deposits. We present a new graphical method for the identification, description and analysis of clast microfabrics in polydeformed tills. This method utilises high resolution digital scans of orientated thin sections imported into a standard computer graphics package to measure the orientation of long axes of detrital (skeleton) grains included within the till. These data are then used to identify the main clast microfabrics present within the till, allowing the delineation of clast microfabric domains in which elongate grains share a similar preferred orientation. This process leads to the identification, characterisation and, most importantly, the interrelationships between the various generations of microfabrics. The relationships between these clast microfabrics and other microstructures (e. g. <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics,</b> turbate structures, shears, folds, faults…etc) can also be examined, providing a detailed microfabric-microstructural map of the thin section. Clast long axis orientation data collected for different parts of a thin section are plotted on a series of rose diagrams allowing the variation in clast microfabric orientation to be displayed graphically. A new set of terminology for the description of clast microfabrics in tills, which is based upon the system used by metamorphic petrologists, is also presented. Three case studies of the fabrics present within subglacial sediments of Pleistocene age as well as the present are used as examples of how to apply this methodology. ...|$|R

Paleosol features in the Iatan-Stranger sequence include clay-filled fractures and solution channels (cryptokarst) {{in the top of}} the Iatan Limestone which display some degree of secondary clay orientation along the edges (neostrians). The clay-filled fractures widen upward and grade into the gray to red mottled, non-calcareous, blocky mudstone of the Stranger Shale, which is characterized by an absence of fauna and presence of slickensides, clay coatings on grains (argillans), quartz silt-filled fractures (skeletans), and possible former rooted zones. The mudstone matrix locally displays the sepic <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics</b> that are characteristic of soil development. Pedogenesis in this unit resulted from subaerial exposure during retreat of the sea following the transgressive-regressive marine cycle that deposited the Iatan Limestone. Solution-channelling of the top of the Iatan and leaching of clays within its fractures indicates initial exposure to a humid climate with strong meteoric flux. The Stranger paleosol, however, displays features of Entisol, Inceptisol, or Vertisol development in terrestrial deposits under a somewhat drier climate following the partial solution of the upper Iatan. These features include a thick (1 to 2. 4 m) paleosol profile with weak morphologic expression which contains crystalline illitic clays and oxidized iron minerals. Lack of fluvial-alluvial features in the thick, monotonous quartz-silty mudstone sequence of the lower Stranger Shale suggests that fine aeolian detrital influx (desert loess) may have contributed much of the material to this unit. The lack of caliche or weathered clays in the Stranger mudstone indicates the importance of using multiple lines of evidence for recognizing paleosols...|$|R

Coarse silt (4 [...] 6 $) laminae are {{abundant in the}} proximal portion of the Amazon subaqueous delta and are composed of numerous grain types, including quartz, feldspar, heavy minerals, wood fragments, and fecal pellets. In distal areas, the coarse silt fraction is absent (because ofpreferential accumulation f coarser material nearer to the source), and laminae generally are thin (~ 0. 1 ram) and are composed offine quartz silt. Most silt laminae are observed within a matrix of platy minerals, and basal contacts are generally sharp, indicating scouring of the seabed uring formation of the laminae. Silt laminae form {{as a result of}} changes insediment supplied from suspension a d from particle-sorting processes operating near and on the seabed. Extinction phenomena of clay minerals and mica in thin sections reveal aunique category of sedimentary structures that is not observable using other (e. g., radiographic) techniques. Two extinction patterns (termed plasmicfabric) are observed: 1) a layered fabric that consists of horizontal layers of relatively coarse, platy minerals, which are interlayered (0. 1 mm vertical scale) with unoriented, finer platy minerals, and 2) a umform fabric with constituent minerals uniformly oriented parallel to bedding (on vertical scales of at least 1 mm).

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{study has been}} made of several weathering profiles on the late-Hercynian Caldas de Reyes granite, NW-Spain. The field examination has been complemented by laboratory studies of large thin sections of hardened weathered material in conjunction with X-ray diffraction analyses. Three groups of features have been investigated by these methods. (a) General structure of regoliths. — They consist of a saprolite, mostly covered by colluvium. The latter can be distinguished from the saprolite by field methods, heavy mineral content and fabric analyses. The saprolites generally display spheroidal weathering. Microfabric analyses showed that spheroidal weathering is conditioned by micro-crack systems. Weathering starts in the joints; it was found that water transport occurred along joint planes, even those of sizes which could not be detected with the naked eye. Reducing conditions could be deduced from the colour and mineral content along these fine channelways, but in later stages oxidizing conditions prevail. Oscillating groundwater has affected the formation of the secondary minerals along the joints, but not in the surrounding saprolite. The soils formed on the regoliths are entic- and orthic haplumbrepts. The umbric epipedon may reach a thickness of 1 40 metres above an altitude of 250 metres. (b) Mineral transformations. — Kaolinite and metahalloysitc are the most common secondary minerals in weathered granites, metamorphic rocks and in an estuarine terrace. In one locality large red pleochroic secondary muscovite has been observed to form. Gibbsite may also form in a highly alkaline environment and where water movement is very restricted in micro-cracks of weathered feldspars. Secondary minerals (gibbsite and microcrystalline material) may form from plagioclase upon weathering, whereas the weathering products of microcline contain no secondary minerals. Interlamellar crystallized kaolinite or metahalloysite between exfoliated biotite-vermiculite lamellae can be observed during the weathering of biotite. The interlamellar crystallization of kaolinite or metahalloysite is not apparent between exfoliated muscovite lamellae. Minute droplets containing titanium, derived from the weathering of biotite crystals and their sagenite inclusions, are commonly found along the original cleavages of exfoliated biotite. Sometimes anatase has been observed to form out of these droplets. (c) Fabric analyses. — Fabric analyses have been performed to the regoliths according to Brewer's (1964) method, but because it was applied to deeper saprolites his terminology had to be supplemented with various new terms. Certain <b>fabrics</b> (skelsepic <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics)</b> are common in colluvium but not in saprolites and neither in soils...|$|R

This type of analysis, which utilises a standard petrological microscope (van der Meer, 1983; Carr, 2004; van der Meer and Menzies, 2011), can provide far greater detail of the depositional and deformation histories recorded by these sediments than can be obtained from macro‐scale studies alone. Published studies have used micromorphology to differentiate between diamictons deposited in different sedimentary environments (van der Meer, 1987; Harris, 1998; Lachniet et al., 1999, 2001; Carr et al., 2000; Carr, 2001; Menzies and Zaniewski, 2003; Carr et al., 2006; Phillips 2006; Menzies et al., 2006; Reinardy and Lukas, 2009; Kilfeather et al., 2010); as an aid {{to our understanding of the}} processes occurring beneath glaciers (Menzies and Maltman, 1992; van der Meer, 1997; Menzies et al., 1997; Khatwa and Tulaczyk, 2001; van der Meer et al., 2003; Roberts and Hart, 2005; Hiemstra et al., 2005; Baroni and Fasano, 2006; Larsen et al., 2006, 2007; Hart, 2007); unravelling the often complex deformation histories recorded by glacigenic sequences (van der Meer, 1993; Phillips and Auton, 2000; van der Wateren et al., 2000; Menzies, 2000; Phillips et al., 2007; Lee and Phillips, 2008; Denis et al., 2010); and investigating the role played by pressurised pore‐water/melt water during these deformation events (Hiemstra and van der Meer, 1997; Phillips and Merritt, 2008; van der Meer et al., 2009; Denis et al., 2010). The terminology used in these studies to describe the various micro‐textures observed in thin section typically follows that proposed by van der Meer (1987, 1993) and Menzies (2000). The recent development of a quantitative microstructural mapping method (Phillips et al., 2011) which utilises commercially available computer graphic software (e. g.

During this process the relationships between successive generations of clast microfabrics and other microstructures (e. g. <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabrics,</b> turbate structures, folds, faults, shears…etc) are determined, allowing a detailed relative chronology of fabric development to be established, applying the terminology and approach typically used by structural geologists and metamorphic petrologists to unravel the often complex, polyphase deformation histories recorded by glacial deposits...|$|R
40|$|Perennial frost mounds {{developed}} across northern Europe following {{retreat of}} the late Quaternary ice sheets (c. 23 – 19). Their relict forms comprise depressions with surrounding ramparts (periglacial ramparted depressions - PRDs). Although PRD surface geometry is well-documented, their origin is less well-understood. There is little agreement on: i) definitive identification of PRDs, ii) PRD formation processes, and iii) the relationship between different frost-mound types (i. e. pingo, palsa and lithalsa). For the first time, this research characterises the internal structure of a relict lithalsa in the Ardennes (Belgium-German border), at macro- (e. g. coring, logging) and micro-scales (thin sections) and contextualises this with observations on the hydrological, lithological and topographic setting. Micromorphology enables the study of sedimentary environments and processes of formation. This investigation identifies diagnostic suites of microstructures indicative of frost action, landform development and environmental setting. The results are then applied to suspected PRDs in Norfolk (Walton Common) and Wales (the Cledlyn Valley), for which a likely frost-mound origin is confirmed. This approach: i) identifies the internal structure of PRDs, ii) considers the potential for change in deformation with depth and lateral extent within the rampart, and iii) considers the differences and similarities in micro-textures and structures {{in a variety of}} grain sizes across the sites where PRDs occur. Key microstructures identified, indicative of cryogenic origins, include: i) a vertical to subvertical microfabric (e. g. frost-jacked grains), ii) platy-prismatic, sub-angular aggregates, iii) planar deformation (e. g. fragmented domains, frost-cracked grains), and iv) evidence of pore-water movement on thawing of ice and associated grain translocation (e. g. silt and clay cappings). Microstructures attributed to PRD development include: i) a sub-vertical microfabric of similarly inclined elongate grains, associated with tilted strata, ii) microstructures linked to mass-wasting during frost-mound growth or rampart formation (e. g. grain concentrations, grain coatings of silt and clay, curvilinear grain arrangements, skelsepic <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabric),</b> iii) planar structures (e. g. grain lineations, linear concentrations of grains and fragmented domains and fractured grains, that may reflect shear strain during rampart-formation processes), and vi) multiple domains, interpreted as re-homogenisation of sediment caused by frost-mound heave, and subsequent rampart-formation processes. Consequently, this research identifies and characterises PRDs, which: i. provides {{a better understanding of the}} genesis of PRDs, for the classification of different types of ice-cored hills, ii. informs palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, since ice-cored hills are diagnostic of former permafrost (frozen ground conditions), iii. informs civil engineering projects where sediments are disturbed by PRD development (e. g. heave and subsidence) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Clay mineral genesis was {{studied in}} soils {{representative}} of several different geomorphic surfaces in western Oregon, {{ranging in age}} from Pliocene-early Pleistocene to late Pleistocene. Soil solution studies, clay mineralogy, and soil raicromorphology were employed to provide evidence of clay mineral synthesis and interpret soil genesis. Soils at each study area were characterized by distinct differences in soil solution chemistry, clay mineralogy, <b>plasmic</b> <b>fabric,</b> and genetic history, although parent material compositions between sites were often similar. Soil solution studies suggested that clay mineral synthesis from solution does not occur in soils representing the oldest geomorphic surface. The cxic soil properties at this location were developed during a prior weathering cycle and the soils are at a genetic endpoint in the present environment. Soil solutions from Ultisols on remnants of Pleistocene surfaces in the Oregon Coast Range were in equilibrium with respect to kaolinite in the solum, but stable with respect to Mg-montmorillonite in the zone characterizing active bedrock weathering. Microraorphological, clay mineralogical, and chemical evidence suggested that alteration of Mgchlorite in sedimentary rocks leads to smectite genesis in the Cr horizon of the Ultisols, followed by conversion of smectite to halloysite and chloritic intergrade in the solum. Alteration of basalt in these soils also leads to the formation of smectite, which is unstable with respect to halloysite in well-drained microenvironments within soil profiles. Soil solutions from soils characteristic of silt-mantled late Pleistocene surfaces on the western margins of the Willamette Valley showed compositional variation from pedon to pedon and horizon to horizon within individual pedons, reflecting the influence of soil parent material compositional variation. Soil solutions were generally in equilibrium with respect to kaolinite, although solutions from horizons developed in tuffaceous sediments were in equilibrium with Mg-montmorillonite. Both kaolinite and smectite were observed as products of mineral authigenesis in these soils. Authigenic clay showed delicate honeycomb or hexagonal morphology in contrast to the parallel oriented appearance of illuvial clays. Andesite alteration in wet, unstable soils of Oregon's western Cascades also resulted in the formation of smectite. The sequence of mineral alteration in andesites is similar to that described for basalts; however, the final products of mineral authigenesis are distinctly microenvironment dependent. Morphologic evidence suggests that chemical properties of bulk soil solutions can not always be considered to represent the solution conditions at the site of mineral authigenesis. In the absence of reliable in situ micro-chemical analytical techniques, detailed micromorphological studies can aid'in interpreting soil microchemical properties at weathering surfaces by revealing the identity of neoformed secondary phases...|$|R
