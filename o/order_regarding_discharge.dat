40|$|Objective: The {{involvement}} of orthopaedic trauma {{patients in the}} decision-making <b>regarding</b> <b>discharge</b> destination from the acute hospital and {{their perceptions of the}} care following discharge are poorly understood. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate orthopaedic trauma patient experiences of discharge from the acute hospital and transition back into the community. Methods: The present qualitative study performed in-depth interviews, between October 2012 and November 2013, with patients aged 18 – 64 years with lower limb trauma. Thematic analysis was used to derive important themes. Results: Ninety-four patients were interviewed, including 35 discharged to in-patient rehabilitation. Key themes that emerged include variable involvement in decision-making <b>regarding</b> <b>discharge,</b> lack of information and follow-up care on discharge and varying opinions regarding in-patient rehabilitation. Readiness for discharge from in-patient rehabilitation also differed widely among patients, with patients often reporting being ready for discharge before the planned discharge date and feeling frustration at the need to stay in in-patient care. There was also a difference in patients’ perception of the factors leading to recovery, with patients discharged to rehabilitation more commonly reporting external factors, such as rehabilitation providers and physiotherapy. Conclusion: The insights provided by the participants in the present study will help us improve our discharge practice, especially the need to address the concerns of inadequate information provision <b>regarding</b> <b>discharge</b> and the role of in-patient rehabilitation...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{interactions}} concerning the frail and elderly patients {{having to do}} with discharge from acute hospital wards and their participation in medical decision-making. The views of the patients and the medical staff were both investigated. DESIGN: A qualitative observational and interview study using the grounded theory. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The setting was three hospitals in rural and urban areas of two counties in Sweden of which one was a teaching hospital. The data comprised observations, healthcare staff interviews and patient interviews. The selected patients were all about to be informed {{that they were going to}} be discharged. RESULTS: The patients were seldom invited to participate in the decision-making <b>regarding</b> <b>discharge.</b> Generally, most communications <b>regarding</b> <b>discharge</b> were between the doctor and the nurse, after which the patient was simply informed about the decision. It was observed that the discharge information was often given in an indirect way as if other, albeit absent, people were responsible for the decision. Interviews with the healthcare staff revealed their preoccupation with the need to free up beds: 'thinking about discharge planning all the time' was the core category. This focus not only failed to fulfil the complex needs of elderly patients, it also generated feelings of frustration and guilt in the staff, and made the patients feel unwelcome. CONCLUSIONS: Frail elderly patients often did not participate in the medical decision-making <b>regarding</b> their <b>discharge</b> from hospital. The staff was highly focused on patients getting rapidly discharged, which made it difficult to fulfil the complex needs of these patients...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the perceptions of consultant surgeons, allied health clinicians and rehabilitation consultants <b>regarding</b> <b>discharge</b> destination decision making from the acute hospital following trauma. Methods: A qualitative study was performed using individual in-depth interviews of clinicians in Victoria (Australia) between April 2013 and September 2014. Thematic analysis was used to derive important themes. Case studies provided quantitative information to enhance the information gained via interviews. Results: Thirteen rehabilitation consultants, eight consultant surgeons and 13 allied health clinicians were interviewed. Key themes that emerged included the importance of financial considerations as drivers of decision making and the perceived lack of involvement of medical staff in decisions <b>regarding</b> <b>discharge</b> destination following trauma. Other themes included the lack of consistency of factors thought to be important drivers of discharge and the difficulty in acting on trauma patients’ requests in terms of discharge destination. Importantly, as the complexity of the patient increases in terms of acquired brain injury, the options for rehabilitation become scarcer. Conclusions: The information gained in the present study highlights the large variation in discharge practises between and within clinical groups. Further consultation with stakeholders involved in the care of trauma patients, as well as government bodies involved in hospital funding, is needed to derive a more consistent approach to discharge destination decision making...|$|R
