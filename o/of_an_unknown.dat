5|$|A basic {{sub-division}} is a {{grouping of}} the eight inner regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator and {{are thought to have}} formed with Jupiter. The remainder of the moons consist <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unknown</b> number of small irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits, which are thought to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. Irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, and just {{opposite}} his own tomb, Ramesses enlarged the earlier small tomb <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unknown</b> Eighteenth Dynasty noble (KV5) for his numerous sons. With 120 known rooms, and excavation work still underway, {{it is probably}} the largest tomb in the valley. Originally opened (and robbed) in antiquity, it is a low-lying structure that has been particularly prone to the flash floods that sometimes hit the area. Tonnes of debris and material has washed in over the centuries, ultimately concealing its vast size. It is not currently open to the public.|$|E
5|$|C.mutica {{populations in}} Europe were first {{found in the}} Netherlands in 1995. During a species inventory, several {{specimens}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unknown</b> caprellid were recovered by Platvoet et al. from artificial structures {{in and around the}} Neeltje-Jans and the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier in Burghsluis, Zeeland. As with the case of the first discovery of C.mutica in North America, Platvoet et al. initially misidentified them as a new species. Remarking upon the resemblance of the caprellids to C.acanthogaster, they named it Caprella macho. They were later discovered to be introduced populations of C.mutica rather than a new species.|$|E

5|$|The Memorial {{contains}} an inscribed roll of honour behind a glass panel, containing {{the names of}} approximately 1600 officers killed whilst on duty, {{in the course of}} effecting an arrest or whilst carrying out hazardous duties. The earliest entry is that <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unknown</b> constable killed in 1680. The book is compiled from the approximately 4000 names recorded by the Police Roll of Honour Trust, listing all officers who have died in the line of duty.|$|E
5|$|The case of Claudius' {{poisoning}} is more complex. Claudius {{was known}} to have been very fond of eating Caesar's mushroom. Following his death, many sources have attributed it to his being fed a meal of death caps instead of Caesar's mushrooms. Ancient authors, such as Tacitus and Suetonius, are unanimous about poison having been added to the mushroom dish, rather than the dish having been prepared from poisonous mushrooms. Wasson speculated the poison used to kill Claudius was derived from death caps, with a fatal dose <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unknown</b> poison (possibly a variety of nightshade) being administered later during his illness.|$|E
5|$|By the 5thcentury, the Romans had {{withdrawn}} from Britain, and the Angles and the Saxons settled. A heptarchy of new kingdoms began to emerge. One {{of the methods}} used by regional kings to solidify their authority over their territories {{was the use of}} ceremony and insignia. The tomb <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unknown</b> king– evidence suggests it may be Rædwald of East Anglia– at Sutton Hoo provides insight into the regalia of a pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon king. Inside the early 7th-century tomb discovered in 1939 was found the ornate Sutton Hoo helmet, comprising an iron cap, a neck guard, and a face mask, decorated with images of animals and warriors in copper-alloy and set with garnets. He was also buried with a heavy whetstone sceptre, on top of which is an iron ring surmounted by the figure of a stag; a decorated sword; and a ceremonial shield.|$|E
30|$|The inverse problem <b>of</b> {{determining}} <b>an</b> <b>unknown</b> coefficient in <b>a</b> linear parabolic equation {{by using}} over-measured data has generated <b>an</b> increasing amount <b>of</b> interest from engineers and scientist {{during the last}} few decades. This kind <b>of</b> problem plays <b>a</b> crucial role in engineering, physics and applied mathematics. The problem <b>of</b> recovering <b>an</b> <b>unknown</b> coefficient or coefficients in the mathematical model of physical phenomena is frequently encountered. Intensive study has been carried out on this kind of problem, and various numerical methods have been developed in order to overcome the problem <b>of</b> determining <b>an</b> <b>unknown</b> coefficient or coefficients [1 – 9]. The inverse problem <b>of</b> <b>unknown</b> coefficients in <b>a</b> quasi-linear parabolic equations was studied by Demir and Ozbilge [5, 6]. Moreover, the identification of the unknown diffusion coefficient in a linear parabolic equation was studied by Demir and Hasanov [7].|$|R

5|$|By {{this stage}} of Operation Overlord, German forces were <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unknown</b> {{quantity}} and quality, but the division would be confronted by elements of Germany's 711th Infantry Division, {{a part of the}} 15th Army. The 711th was composed of the 731st and the 744th Grenadier Infantry Regiments, together with artillery and other supporting arms. Even before the invasion the German division had not been considered a front line formation, but rather a static division on anti-invasion duties, and many of its units had not been at full strength. Furthermore, many of its troops were older than was normal in a first line division, or were conscripted foreigners from Poland and Russia. Being a static division, it was hampered further by having almost no transport of its own, and what was available was mostly horse drawn.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the cathedral}} began in about 1175, to the design <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unknown</b> architect. Wells is the first cathedral in England to be, from its foundation, built in the Gothic style. According to art {{historian}} John Harvey, {{it is the first}} truly Gothic cathedral in the world, its architects having entirely dispensed with all the features that bound the contemporary east end of Canterbury Cathedral and the earlier buildings of France, such as the east end of the Abbey of Saint Denis, to the Romanesque. Unlike these churches, Wells has clustered piers rather than columns and has a gallery of identical pointed arches rather than the typically Romanesque form of paired openings. The style, with its simple untraceried lancet arches and convoluted mouldings, is known as Early English Gothic.|$|E
5|$|Dvenadsat Apostolov {{was built}} by the Nikolayev Admiralty Dockyard at Nikolayev. She was laid down on 21 August 1889, {{launched}} on 13 September 1890, and sailed to Sevastopol for fitting out on 11 May 1892. She joined the fleet on 17 June 1893, {{but she was not}} fully ready for service until 1894. In 1895 she was used to test a new system of laying mines by rails that had been invented by Lieutenant A. P. Ygrumov and also to evaluate the proper dimensions for anti-torpedo nets and their booms. For this last test torpedoes were fired at the ship with the anti-torpedo nets deployed. One gun, <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unknown</b> calibre, burst in 1903, killing one man and wounding two others.|$|E

5|$|Gliese 3634 is a M-class dwarf star, {{meaning that}} it is small, emits reddish light, and has a {{relatively}} low temperature for a star. The star is 0.45 times the mass of and 0.43 times the radius of the Sun. Gliese 3634 is 0.020 times as luminous as the Sun, {{meaning that it}} radiates about 2% {{of the amount of}} energy that the Sun does. It was described as an intermediately active star in its discovery paper. Gliese 3634 lies 19.8 parsecs (approximately 64.6 light years) away from Earth, a relatively close star. Gliese 3634 b is the only planet to have been confirmed in the star's orbit, although initial analysis of the data suggests that a secondary body <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unknown</b> nature also exists, with an orbit of more than 200 days and a mass approximately twice that of Neptune's.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Nate caused {{minor damage}} in southeastern Mexico in mid-September2011. The sixteenth named storm and fourth {{hurricane}} of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Nate originated from a frontal trough in the Bay of Campeche on September7. Within a weak steering environment, the storm meandered southwestward while gradually gaining strength. Though {{classified as a}} tropical storm operationally, data during a post-season review indicated that Nate briefly attained Category 1 hurricane status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale on September8. As {{a result of its}} slow motion, the storm caused significant upwelling, leading to a marked decrease in convection, and weakening accordingly. On September11, Nate moved ashore Mexico as a tropical storm, producing several inches of rainfall and damaging several hundred structures. Ten oil rig workers went missing; seven were rescued, but one died <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unknown</b> cause, and three other bodies were later recovered. In Veracruz, a boy was killed after being struck by lightning.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 Paraná {{was again}} {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Council of Ministers, {{at the head of}} a highly successful cabinet, and became the most powerful politician in the country. The electoral reform he ushered in was credited with undermining national political processes and causing severe harm to the system of parliamentary government. For his role in pushing through restructuring, Paraná met with fierce opposition from the majority of his colleagues, leading to a virtual split in the Conservative Party over his policies. On 3 September 1856, while still in office and at the height of his political career, he died unexpectedly <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unknown</b> febrile condition. He is widely regarded by historians as one of the most influential statesmen of his time.|$|E
