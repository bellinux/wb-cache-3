Well, as curves {{are more}} {{beautiful}} than straight lines, {{it is necessary to}} a good composition that its continuities of <b>object,</b> <b>mass,</b> or color should be, if possible, in curves, rather than straight lines or angular ones. Perhaps one of the simplest and prettiest examples of a graceful continuity of this kind is in the line traced at any moment by the corks of a net as it is being drawn: nearly every person is more or less attracted by the beauty of the dotted line. Now, it is almost always possible, not only to secure such a continuity in the arrangement or boundaries of objects which, like these bridge arches or the corks of the net, are actually connected with each other, but--and this is a still more noble and interesting kind of continuity--among features which appear at first entirely separate. Thus the towers of Ehrenbreitstein, on the left, in Fig. 32, appear at first independent of each other; but when I give their profile, on a larger scale, Fig. 35, the reader may easily perceive that there is a subtle cadence and harmony among them. The reason of this is, that they are all bounded by one grand curve, traced by the dotted line; out of the seven towers, four precisely touch this curve, the others only falling hack from it here and there to keep the eye from discovering it too easily.|$|E

5000|$|In {{case study}} {{two of his}} book Women, Fire and Dangerous Things, Lakoff re-presented the {{analysis}} of the English word over done by Claudia Brugman in her (1981) master's thesis. Similar to the analysis of out given by Johnson, Lakoff argued that there were six basic spatial schemas for the English word over. Moreover, Lakoff gave a detailed accounting of how these schemas were interrelated in terms of what he called a radial category structure. For example, these six schemas could be both further specified by other spatial schemas such as whether the trajector was in contact with the landmark or not (as in the plane flew over the mountain vs. he climbed over the mountain). Furthermore, Lakoff identified a group of [...] "transformational" [...] image schemata such as rotational schemas and path to <b>object</b> <b>mass,</b> as in Spider-Man climbed all over the wall. This analysis raised profound questions about how image schemas could be grouped, transformed, and how sequences of image schemas could be chained together in language, mind and brain.|$|E
5000|$|As in {{the case}} of the Liénard-Wiechert {{potentials}} for electromagnetic effects and waves, the static potentials from a moving gravitational mass (i.e., its simple gravitational field, also known as gravitostatic field) are [...] "updated," [...] so that they point to the mass's actual position at constant velocity, with no retardation effects. This happens also for static electric and magnetic effects and is required by Lorentz symmetry, since any mass or charge moving with constant velocity at a great distance, could be replaced by a moving observer at the same distance, with the object now at [...] "rest." [...] In this latter case, the static gravitational field seen by the observer would be required to point to the same position, which is the non-retarded position of the <b>object</b> (<b>mass).</b> Only gravitational waves, caused by acceleration of a mass, and which cannot be removed by a change in a distant observer's inertial frame, must be subject to aberration, and thus originate from a retarded position and direction, due to their finite velocity of travel from their source. Such waves correspond to electromagnetic waves radiated from an accelerated charge.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has identified that prehension {{is composed of}} a reach and a grasp component and that the position {{and size of the}} object can independently affect each. However, no effects on prior to contact prehension kinematics have been reported for manipulations in <b>object</b> <b>mass.</b> We felt that this 'lack of a finding' was surprising, as a more accurate grip position on heavier objects would prevent slippage and rotation when lifting the object. Therefore, we hypothesized that increased <b>object</b> <b>mass</b> would effect the grasp component movement kinematics prior to contact in preparation for a stable final grip placement on the object. We report two experiments in which participants reached, grasped and lifted objects of various size and mass, and their movement kinematics were recorded using a motion tracking system. The results showed that the mass of the object significantly influenced prior-to-contact grasp kinematics. Both studies showed that the heavy compared to light objects caused increased peak grasp aperture, a final finger and thumb placement on the object that more closely passed through the object centre of mass, increased lift delay and reduced peak lift velocity. The data are discussed in terms of how <b>object</b> <b>mass</b> influences the reach, grasp and lift components of prehensile movement...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{static stability}} of a planar object grasped by multifingers with three joints. Each individual joint (prismatic joint or revolute joint) is modeled as a linear spring stiffness. The <b>object</b> <b>mass</b> and the link masses are also included. We consider not only pure rolling contact but also frictionless sliding contact. The grasp stability is investigated using the potential energy method. This paper makes the following contributions: (i) Grasp wrench vectors and grasp stiffness matrices are analytically derived {{not only for}} the rolling contact but also for the sliding contact; (ii) It is shown in detail that the vectors and the matrices are given by functions of grasp parameters such as the contact conditions (rolling contact and sliding contact), the contact position, the contact force, the local curvature, the link shape, the <b>object</b> <b>mass,</b> the link masses, and so on; (iii) By using positive definiteness of the difference matrix of the grasp stiffness matrices, it is analytically proved that the rolling contact grasp is more stable than the sliding contact grasp. The displacement direction affected by the contact condition deviation is derived; (iv) By using positive definiteness of the differential matrix with respect to the local curvatures, it is analytically proved that the grasp stability increases when the local curvatures decrease. The displacement direction affected by the local curvature deviation is also derived; (v) Effects of the <b>object</b> <b>mass</b> and the joint positions are discussed using numerical examples. The numerical results are reinforced by analytical explanations. The effect of the link masses is also investigated...|$|E

To simplify somewhat {{the complexity of the}} discussion, it can say that an objective measurement can be made if the gathered empirical data are described by a mathematical model that has three fundamental properties: linearity, stochastic independence, and specific objectivity.

40|$|Where did {{words come}} from? The {{traditional}} {{view is that}} the relation between the sound of a word and its meaning is arbitrary. An alternative hypothesis, known as sound symbolism, holds that form-meaning correspondence is systematic. Numerous examples of sound symbolism exist across natural language phyla. Moreover, cross-linguistic similarities suggest that sound symbolism represents a language universal. For example, many unrelated languages affix an &#x 22;ee&#x 22; sound to words in order to emphasize size distinctions or express affection (e. g., look at the teeny weeny baby); other such phonetic universals are evident for <b>object</b> <b>mass,</b> color, brightness, and aggression. We hypothesize that sound symbolism reflects sensitivity to an ecological law (i. e., Hooke&#x 27;s Law) governing an inverse relation between <b>object</b> <b>mass</b> and acoustic resonance. In two experiments healthy adults showed high agreement in matching pure tones to color swatches and nonwords to novel objects as linear functions of frequency and luminance.
