5|$|When {{they arise}} in the spring, the females go to nursery colonies which may often be the same place where they were born. These nursery colonies consist mainly of adult females and their young and can {{be located in the}} attics of warm {{buildings}} where there is high humidity. These colonies sometimes reach numbers of bats as great as 1,000 per cave/forest. Gestation lasts 50–60 days. They usually have <b>one</b> <b>baby</b> per female each year, sometimes twins, born sometime from late May to early July. The young are born in an altricial state with their eyes closed and will hang in the nursery while their mothers forage at night. Their eyes open on their second day. They cling to a nipple constantly until they are two weeks old. At three weeks, they learn to fly. By four weeks, they are adult sized. Females may be sexually mature in the fall after their birth, but males may take a year longer. About half of females and most males breed during their first autumn.|$|E

25|$|Infant sloths {{normally}} {{cling to}} their mothers' fur, but occasionally fall off. Sloths are very sturdily built and rarely die from a fall. In some cases, they die from a fall indirectly because the mothers prove unwilling {{to leave the}} safety of the trees to retrieve the young. Females normally bear <b>one</b> <b>baby</b> every year, but sometimes sloths' low level of movement actually keeps females from finding males for longer than one year. Sloths are not particularly sexually dimorphic and several zoos have received sloths of the wrong sex.|$|E

[...] At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: [...] "What will really happen is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time.

500|$|... "The One Hundredth" [...] was co-written by show creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman and {{directed}} by Kevin S. Bright. The episode {{takes place in a}} hospital, meaning none of the usual filming sets were used, thus surprising several members of the audience. Crane commented that the hundred episode was a [...] "big milestone" [...] for the series and to mark the major event, Lisa Kudrow's character Phoebe would give birth to triplets. This brought a culmination to the surrogacy story arc, which began in the fourth season; it was developed to accommodate Lisa Kudrow's real life pregnancy. When Kudrow accepted the surrogate mother storyline, the idea of having more than <b>one</b> <b>baby</b> was [...] "comically funny" [...] to Kauffman, and giving birth to triplets or [...] "their brother's children" [...] was something never seen on television. Phoebe's pregnancy gave the writers incredible license for her to [...] "be just outrageously mean and still have it be funny". In order to prepare for the labor and birthing scenes, Kauffman watched a video of her cousin giving birth.|$|E
500|$|The raiders {{successfully}} sneaked {{past the}} outer garrisons of provincial militia, and were first spotted in the pre-dawn light by a villager. [...] Firing his gun {{to raise the}} alarm, {{he ran for the}} village, with the French and Indians in noisy pursuit. [...] The action quickly became general as the raiders descended on the houses in the village. [...] One of the colonial garrisons was stationed in the home of the minister, Benjamin Rolfe, who had barred the door in an attempt to keep the raiders out. [...] Raiders fired through the door, wounding Rolfe, and then broke the door down. They then slaughtered Rolfe, his wife, infant child, and the colonial militiamen, who, [...] "paralyzed by fear", were begging for mercy. [...] In another house, <b>one</b> <b>baby</b> was thrown through an open window by a raider but suffered no injury. [...] A number of villagers escaped by hiding in cellars whose trapdoors were not discovered by the raiders. [...] Captain Wainwright was preparing to organize a defense when gunfire from the raiders passed through the door to his house, killing him instantly.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{countries}} have sub-replacement fertility (that is, below 2.1-2.2 children per woman). Replacement fertility is typically 2.1-2.2 because this replaces the two parents and boys are born {{more often than}} girls (somewhat 1.05-1.1 to 1) and adds population to compensate for deaths (i.e. members of the population who die without full reproducing, for example, {{in the age of}} 30-35, giving a birth just to <b>one</b> <b>baby)</b> with approx. 0.1 additional. [...] Many European and East Asian countries now have higher death rates than birth rates. Population aging and population decline may eventually occur, assuming that the fertility rate does not change and sustained mass immigration does not occur.|$|E

2500|$|Rebecca was {{extremely}} uncomfortable during her pregnancy {{and went to}} inquire of God why she was suffering so. According to the Midrash, whenever she would pass a house of Torah study, Jacob would struggle to come out; whenever she would pass a house of idolatry, Esau would agitate to come out. Thinking that she was carrying <b>one</b> <b>baby</b> who was displaying conflicting propensities, Rebecca sought enlightenment at the yeshiva of Shem and Eber. There she received the prophecy that twins were fighting in her womb and would continue to fight all their lives. The prophecy {{also said that the}} older would serve the younger; its statement, [...] "One people will be stronger than the other" [...] has been taken to mean that the two nations will never gain power simultaneously; when one falls, the other will rise, and vice versa. According to tradition, Rebecca did not share the prophecy with her husband.|$|E
2500|$|Boat 10 was {{launched}} at about 1:50a.m. under Murdoch's supervision with Able-Bodied Seaman Edward Buley in charge. It {{appears to have}} had about 35 people aboard when it {{was launched}}. By this time Titanic was listing to port, making {{it increasingly difficult to}} launch lifeboats from that side of the ship, as the ship's list had created a gap of about [...] between the deck and the sides of the port-side lifeboats. An attempt to board by a young French woman nearly ended in disaster when her jump into the lifeboat fell short and she dropped into the gap. She caught the gunwale of the lifeboat while her feet found the railings on the deck below, and she was pulled back on board the ship. She made it into the lifeboat safely on her second attempt. Titanic was clearly not far from sinking and this realisation led to an increased urgency to load the lifeboat; children were rushed aboard, <b>one</b> <b>baby</b> literally being thrown in and caught by a female passenger. A male passenger, whom Lowe later described as a [...] "crazed Italian", rushed to the rail as the boat was being lowered and jumped in. Neshan Krekorian, an Armenian passenger from third class, is said to have jumped into Boat 10 as it was being lowered. Among the people on Boat 10 was the youngest Titanic passenger, nine-week-old Millvina Dean, who was also the last remaining survivor. She accompanied her mother, Mrs. Etta Dean, and her older brother Bertram. Two of those aboard were later transferred to another lifeboat, and it had 55 aboard when it met Carpathia a few hours later. [...] It was the second to last lifeboat to be picked up, at 8:00a.m.|$|E
