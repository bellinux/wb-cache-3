5|$|The Command was too {{expensive}} to maintain and cost cuts were made during the 1950s which caused a reduction in strength. By mid-1957 the Command had been cut to 82 aircraft. By mid-1958 it had shrunk to just 67. The Shackletons dominated {{the core of this}} force, numbering 54 aircraft. The Neptune was cut from the service altogether, beginning on 31 August 1956. There was little <b>operational</b> <b>action</b> for the Command at this point. It airlifted British Army forces into Egypt during the Suez Crisis which was its major action during this period. The lack of funds and any active conventional military role saw the Command struggle to keep its front-line strength high. There was a brief alert in October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when all six squadrons it then possessed were put on high alert, but nothing came of the crisis, although the Shackleton squadrons at RAF Ballykelly were sent to Macrihanish as it was known that Ballykelly was on the Soviet IRBM target list.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} how the contextual opportunity structures in which the Dutch Military Observation and Liaison Teams (MOLTs), later Mission Teams (MTs) operated, affected the <b>operational</b> <b>actions</b> of the MOLTs during the Netherlands Provincial Reconstruction Team (1 (NL) PRT) mission in the North-Afghan province Baghlan from 2004 till 2006. Although the PRT consisted of different elements, the focus is on the MOLTs, because these teams were seen as the primary carriers of the Netherlands PRT mission. They were the eyes and ears of the Netherlands PRT. The MOLTs operated in a larger structural context in which different contextual features hindered or facilitated the <b>operational</b> <b>actions</b> of the MOLTs. This ‘affect’ is explained in terms of mechanisms and processes to get a deeper understanding of how and why there was an ‘affect’. Although the concept of opportunity structures is mainly focused on external factors that hindered or facilitated actions, this study shows also features that appear inside the MOLT or PRT organization hindered or facilitated <b>operational</b> <b>actions.</b> During the mission, a significant shift has taken place in how internal and external features of the opportunity structures affected the <b>operational</b> <b>actions</b> of the MOLTs...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to present a systematic methodology called PACE Facilitator.

The proposed methodology is an integrated, conceptual, pragmatic, and systemfocused route for the company planning and administration, stepby- step. For the organizations to get their expected results it is necessary an intimate relationship between the <b>operational</b> <b>actions</b> adopted and the strategic objectives established. This is a pioneering work because it contains the systematization of phases, which are: the Integral Process (I) and the Revising and Replanning Process (R). The Integral Process (I) implements all the steps, namely the equalization of organization people´s knowledge, the preparation for the planning and administration, the gathering of situational data, the strategic diagnosis, the process of strategic formulation, the strategic planning, the operational planning, the organizational planning, the budget planning, projects, programs, business plans, and action plans. It continues with the orientation policy for an integrated and shared operalization as well as the adoption of controlling systems, following-up, and performance evaluation. The Revising and Planning Process (R) considers what was implemented to achieve the strategic objectives and also evaluates the performance, retaking the integral process of planning and administration proposed by the methodology in order to promote a virtuous circle and {{to make it possible for}} the company to have an ongoing improvement.
