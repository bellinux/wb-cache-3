25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you know you would not have brought out <b>of</b> <b>yourself.</b> He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E
25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> as having a will that brings things about.|$|E

500|$|When she {{was growing}} up, Aaliyah {{attended}} Detroit schools and believed she was well-liked, but got teased for her short stature. She recalled coming into her own prior to age 15 and grew to love her height. Her mother would tell her to be happy that she was small and compliment her. Other children disliked Aaliyah, {{but she did not}} stay focused on them. [...] "You always have to deal with people who are jealous, but there were so few it didn't even matter. The majority of kids supported me, which was wonderful. When it comes to dealing with negative people, I just let it in one ear and out the other. Those people were invisible to me." [...] Even in her adult life, she considered herself small. She had [...] "learned to accept and love" [...] herself and added: [...] "...the {{most important thing is to}} think highly <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> because if you don't, no one else will".|$|E
500|$|René Pérez Joglar, who {{performs}} {{as the lead}} singer of Puerto Rican alternative hip hop band {{under the name of}} Residente, appears as a featured artist on the track [...] "Gordita". He explained the conception of the song, in which he raps about the fact that [...] "he liked Shakira better when — early in her career: she was chubbier, had dark hair and was a rock chick", by saying that [...] "I told her (Shakira) {{it was a good idea}} to make fun <b>of</b> <b>yourself.</b> That way the haters can't say anything, because you already said it". British rapper Dizzee Rascal appears as a featured artist on the English version of [...] "Loca". He said that he felt [...] "honoured" [...] that Shakira chose him for the song, by saying that [...] "She's a bit of a trendsetter -- she does loads of different things on a major scale. You'd expect her to use an American rapper (for the song), but she chose me. It meant a lot".|$|E
500|$|Although Gordon's lyrics on Experimental Jet Set {{addressed}} {{gender roles}} and stereotypes, her contributions to Washing Machine were considered more feminine and girl-oriented. Tom Moon of Rolling Stone noted, [...] "The title track is an odd, earnest love song; 'Panty Lies' is a playground taunt blown to absurd extremes; and ' Trouble Girl', the Spector sendup, is a dramatic, earnest coming-of-age story". The latter {{was described by}} David Browne of Entertainment Weekly as [...] "a teen-pregnancy lullaby" [...] and features vocals by Gordon and Kim Deal (of Pixies and the Breeders) along with other musicians. Gordon felt that Deal had an ideal voice for the melodic part and explained that the song was about [...] "wanting to be seen for who you really are, being able to express those parts <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> that aren't 'good girl' but that are just as real and true". Ranaldo contributed to two songs, [...] "Saucer-Like" [...] and [...] "Skip Tracer". The latter was co-written with Ranaldo's wife Leah Singer and inspired by a performance that the couple attended of riot grrrl duo Mecca Normal. The song alludes to the band's special relationship with the major labels.|$|E

500|$|The {{ceremony}} was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new {{mood in the}} United Kingdom: it [...] "had barely finished before {{it had become a}} byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's {{ceremony was}} hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country. Boyle himself says this {{was the most important thing}} he took away from the Olympic experience: [...] "How important it is to believe in something.

500|$|In an October 2013 SPIN {{magazine}} article—a reflection at the ten-year {{anniversary of}} Smith's death—drummer McPherson stated that Smith was [...] "a sick man without his medicine" [...] {{during the last}} 31 days of his life, {{when he was not}} only sober, but had also given up red meat and sugar. In the same article, Chiba recalls thinking, [...] "Okay, you're asking a lot <b>of</b> <b>yourself.</b> You're giving up a lot at once." [...] Chiba further explained that [...] "anyone who understands drug abuse knows that you use drugs to hide from your past or sedate yourself from strong, overwhelming feelings. So when you're newly clean and coming off the medications that have been masking all those feelings, that's when you're the most vulnerable." [...] Writing for SPIN, Liam Gowing also encountered a local musician who stated that Smith had said to him: [...] "The people who try to intervene, they're good people who genuinely care about you. But they don't know what you're going through. Do what you need to do." [...] According to the musician, Smith had adamantly dissuaded him from suicide.|$|E

Afterwards, another protester, who had climbed {{the steps of the}} gantry where the BBC were broadcasting to film the protest on a mobile phone, said: [...] "You should be ashamed <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> mate. Shame on you!" [...] Robinson replied [...] "I'm not remotely ashamed of myself. Why should I be ashamed of myself?" [...] He wrote in his blog afterwards: [...] "I lost my temper and I regret that. However, as I explained afterwards to the protesters who disrupted my broadcast, there are many opportunities to debate whether the troops should be out of Afghanistan without the need to stick a sign on a long pole and wave it in front of a camera". Some days later, Robinson read out a jokily ambiguous [...] "letter of apology" [...] on the comedy game show Have I Got News for You, broadcast on 4 November 2010.|$|E
