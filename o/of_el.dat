5|$|Concentrated near water bodies, the {{vegetation}} in most <b>of</b> <b>El</b> Hatillo is dense forests, occupying around 30% of the surface. Smaller plants like shrubs take around 9% and herbs occupy a similar percentage.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} following issues: (i) the incidence <b>of</b> <b>Els</b> among Malaysian companies (ii) the nature <b>of</b> <b>Els</b> among Malaysian companies (iii) the relation between Eld and income smoothing, and (iv) {{the relation between the}} incidence (and relative size <b>of</b> <b>Els)</b> and firm's size, gearing and management ownership. Even though the findings of the paper may not be as useful as the reporting <b>of</b> <b>Els</b> has been restricted via the adoption of the revised SI 8, they may shed light as to the nature, extent and explanation <b>of</b> reporting <b>Els</b> among the Malaysian companies. Nonetheless, the finding will be useful to determine whether the adoption of the revised standard has any significant impact on the information content of the financial statements. Additionally, the findings may enable users to predict the characteristics of companies that are likely to get around the revised SI 8 in order to enable them to report Els...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} <b>of</b> elastic layers (<b>ELs)</b> at junctions between {{walls and}} floor slabs on airborne and structure-borne sound transmission in buildings is investigated. For this aim, we carried out measurements on scale models with ELs at the joints. The results {{were compared with}} the predictions of the statistical energy analysis model. This model included the theoretically calculated transmission coefficients for junctions between elastically coupled plates. As a practical application, we analysed the performance <b>of</b> <b>ELs</b> in {{a model for a}} real building structure and for various positions <b>of</b> <b>ELs.</b> The work showed that the benefits of the use <b>of</b> <b>ELs</b> depend on the specific situation: the effect can be either positive or negative, In fact, the global effect <b>of</b> <b>ELs</b> is only a change in the distribution of the total energy. If less energy is transmitted into one direction, more energy will be transmitted into the other one. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltdstatus: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The Spanish conquest <b>of</b> <b>El</b> Salvador was the {{campaign}} {{undertaken by the}} Spanish conquistadores against the Late Postclassic Mesoamerican polities in the territory that is now incorporated into the modern Central American nation <b>of</b> <b>El</b> Salvador. El Salvador is the smallest country in Central America, and is dominated by two mountain ranges running east-west. Its climate is tropical, and the year is divided into wet and dry seasons. Before the conquest the country formed {{a part of the}} Mesoamerican cultural region, and was inhabited by a number of indigenous peoples, including the Pipil, the Lenca, the Xinca, and Maya. Native weaponry consisted of spears, bows and arrows, and wooden swords with inset stone blades; they wore padded cotton armour.|$|E

5|$|Voltaire {{depicts the}} worst of the world and his pathetic hero's desperate effort to fit it into an optimistic outlook. Almost all of Candide is a {{discussion}} of various forms of evil: its characters rarely find even temporary respite. There is at least one notable exception: the episode <b>of</b> <b>El</b> Dorado, a fantastic village in which the inhabitants are simply rational, and their society is just and reasonable. The positivity <b>of</b> <b>El</b> Dorado may be contrasted with the pessimistic attitude of most of the book. Even in this case, the bliss <b>of</b> <b>El</b> Dorado is fleeting: Candide soon leaves the village to seek Cunégonde, whom he eventually marries only {{out of a sense of}} obligation.|$|E
5|$|A few sculptures, {{including}} Epimetheus and Pandora, {{have been}} attributed to El Greco. This doubtful attribution is based on the testimony of Pacheco (he saw in El Greco's studio a series of figurines, but these may have been merely models). There are also four drawings among the surviving works <b>of</b> <b>El</b> Greco; three of them are preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the fourth is a study for one of his paintings, The Crucifixion.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of the Treaty of Versailles {{following}} World War I, most of West Prussia, including much of the Marienwerder region, was allocated to the Second Polish Republic. Parts of the territory east of the river Vistula took part in the East Prussian plebiscite and remained in the Free State of Prussia within Weimar Germany. These parts of the Marienwerder region were officially incorporated into the Province of East Prussia in 1922, and renamed from Regierungsbezirk Marienwerder to Regierungsbezirk Westpreußen, or [...] "West Prussia". This smaller region consisted of the rural districts <b>of</b> <b>Elbing,</b> Marienburg (now Malbork), Marienwerder (now Kwidzyn), Rosenberg (now Susz), Stuhm (now Sztum), and the city <b>of</b> <b>Elbing</b> (Elbląg); the districts <b>of</b> <b>Elbing</b> and Marienburg and the city <b>of</b> <b>Elbing</b> had previously been part of Regierungsbezirk Danzig. The districts of Deutsch-Krone, Flatow, and Schlochau became part of the new Prussian Grenzmark Posen-Westpreußen. The districts of Graudenz, Konitz, Kulm, Löbau, Schwetz, Strasburg, and Thorn became part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship of Poland.|$|R
