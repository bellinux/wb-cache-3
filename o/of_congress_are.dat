5|$|There {{were four}} Saxbe fixes for appointees of presidents prior to Barack Obama. The first two rollbacks {{concerned}} appointees of Republicans William Howard Taft and Richard Nixon, {{and the last}} two were implemented for appointees of Democrats Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Congress approved two more in the weeks preceding Obama's presidency in preparation for his designated Cabinet nominees. Since the 1980s, Saxbe fixes have only been temporary, extending to {{the conclusion of the}} term for which the sitting member of Congress was elected. The Clause has received relatively little scholarly or judicial attention; the sparse extant debate centers on whether the reduction of salary satisfies the Ineligibility Clause, or whether affected members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> ineligible for appointment in spite of the reduction.|$|E
5|$|Acts <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. It is open to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E
5|$|Many {{politicians}} {{with strong}} personalities {{and a powerful}} attachment to the institution <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> reputed still to roam the halls of Congress long after their deaths. The shades of Representative Joseph Cannon (R-Ill. and Speaker from 1903 to 1911) and Rep. Champ Clark (D-Mo. and Speaker from 1911 to 1919) are claimed to occasionally return to the dark chamber of the House of Representatives after midnight and, after a loud rap from a gavel, resume the strong, angry debates they once had in life. Members of the United States Capitol Police have claimed to have seen Senator (and from 1852 to 1854, Representative) Thomas Hart Benton sitting at a desk in National Statuary Hall, although {{it has not been}} used as a legislative chamber since 1857. Steve Livengood, chief tour guide for the United States Capitol Historical Society, says he has seen the ghost of former Representative Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.) near Mills' former office late at night. Pierre Charles L'Enfant, although not a politician, was a brevet Major during the American Revolutionary War who served with George Washington at Valley Forge. In 1791, L'Enfant was appointed architect and planner of the new city of Washington in the District of Columbia. Although L'Enfant submitted grandiose plans for the new capital city, his plans were never fully adopted and President Washington dismissed him. L'Enfant spent {{much of the rest of}} his life attempting to wrest a monetary payment from Congress, and he died in poverty in 1825. Eyewitnesses, however, claim to have seen his spirit walking through the Capitol, head down, murmuring to himself, with the plans for the capital city tucked under his arm.|$|E

25|$|Many {{politically}} {{powerful people}} make money {{before coming to}} office, but in general the political power elite have official incomes in the $150,000 to $185,000 range; members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> paid $174,000, and are effectively required to have a residence in their district {{as well as one}} in Washington.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Congress {{passed the}} Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, {{better known as}} the Taft-Hartley Act. Section 304 amended Section 313 of the Federal Corrupt Practices Act to make it {{unlawful}} for any labor organization to make a contribution or expenditure in connection with any election in which presidential and vice presidential electors or a member <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> to be voted for or in connection with any primary election, political convention or caucus to select candidates for such offices.|$|E

25|$|Congress {{is split}} into two chambers—House and Senate—and manages the task of writing {{national}} legislation by dividing work into separate committees which specialize in different areas. Some members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> elected by their peers to be officers of these committees. Further, Congress has ancillary {{organizations such as the}} Government Accountability Office and the Library of Congress to help provide it with information, and members of Congress have staff and offices to assist them as well. In addition, a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{a series}} of court-ordered re-drawings that made the 10th {{district}} substantially more Democratic, Webster announced he would instead run for the open seat of the 11th district. The re-tooled 11th District boundaries includes a swath of Webster's former 10th district. He opted to maintain his residence in Winter Garden, within the borders of the 10th; members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> only required to live in the state they wish to represent. Webster won the Republican primary 60%-40% over Justin Grabelle. He followed up with a 65%-32% victory in the general election over Democrat Dave Koller.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Hastert's firm Dickstein Shapiro and the {{lobbying}} firm of former House majority leader-turned lobbyist Dick Gephardt split a $1.4 million annual lobbying {{contract with the}} government of Turkey. In April 2013, Hastert and Gephardt traveled with eight members of Congress to Turkey, with all expenses paid by the Turkish government. While members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> generally prohibited from corporate-funded travel abroad with lobbyists (a rule enacted after the Abramoff scandal), the law permits lobbyists to plan and attend trips overseas if paid for by foreign countries. Hastert defended the trip, saying that he had [...] "meticulously" [...] followed the rules and that the involvement of himself and Gephardt [...] "allowed those members of Congress who were there to have a fuller experience." [...] A National Journal investigation highlighted the trip as an example of loopholes creating a situation in which [...] "lobbyists who can't legally buy a lawmaker a sandwich can still escort members on trips all around the world." ...|$|E

2500|$|The implied {{threat of}} a {{filibuster}} — and the resulting 60-vote requirement {{in the modern era}} — have had major impacts on the ability of recent Presidents to enact their top legislative priorities into law. [...] The effects of the 60-vote requirement are most apparent in periods where the President and both Houses <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> controlled by the same political party, typically early in a presidential term.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, the Supreme Court {{has treated}} {{campaign}} contributions {{as a free}} speech issue. Some see money as a good influence in politics since it [...] "enables candidates to communicate with voters." [...] Few members retire from Congress without complaining about {{how much it costs}} to campaign for reelection. Critics contend that members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> more likely to attend to the needs of heavy campaign contributors than to ordinary citizens.|$|E
2500|$|When the Presidency {{and both}} Houses <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> {{controlled}} by one party, the Speaker normally takes {{a low profile}} and defers to the President.

50|$|Members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> {{who have}} <b>been</b> censured are {{required}} to give up any committee chairs they hold, but are not removed from office. In general, each house <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> responsible for invoking censure against its own members; censure against other government officials is not common. Because censure is not specifically mentioned as the accepted form of reprimand, many censure actions against members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> may <b>be</b> listed officially as rebuke, condemnation, or denouncement.|$|R
