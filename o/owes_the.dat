25|$|A {{player who}} cannot pay what they owe is {{bankrupt}} and {{eliminated from the}} game. If the bankrupt player <b>owes</b> <b>the</b> bank, they must turn all of their assets over to the bank, who then auctions off their properties (if they have any), except buildings. If the debt is instead to another player, all the assets are instead given to that opponent, but the new owner must still pay the bank to un-mortgage any such properties received. The winner is the remaining player left after all the others have gone bankrupt.|$|E
25|$|The bond is a debt security, {{under which}} the issuer <b>owes</b> <b>the</b> holders a debt and (depending on {{the terms of the}} bond) is obliged to pay them {{interest}} (the coupon) or to repay the principal at a later date, termed the maturity date. Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals (semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly). Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market.|$|E
5000|$|Colonial {{treasury}} records {{confirmed that}} Robinson {{had been using}} the paper money {{he was supposed to}} destroy (in his role as treasurer), and also lending out taxes collected by local sheriffs before depositing them in the treasury. Robinson lent the currency to his political supporters, as well as used it to pay his personal debts. In December 1766, a staggering report to the House of Burgesses indicated that Robinson's estate <b>owed</b> <b>the</b> colony over £100,000. After the [...] "Robinson affair", the roles of speaker and treasurer were separated. Modern auditing established the embezzlement at £109,335 Virginia currency, very close to the estimate by Robert Carter Nicholas published in the Virginia Gazette of June 27, 1766. Moreover, records ultimately showed that, of the lawyers, judges and sureties consenting to Pendleton and his co-executors being appointed, only Baylor Walker <b>owed</b> <b>the</b> Speaker no money {{at the time of his}} death. <b>The</b> others collectively <b>owed</b> <b>the</b> estate more than £10,000.

500|$|The Hippocratic School gave {{importance}} to the clinical doctrines of observation and documentation. These doctrines dictate that physicians record their findings and their medicinal methods in a very clear and objective manner, so that these records may be passed down and employed by other physicians. Hippocrates made careful, regular note of many symptoms including complexion, pulse, fever, pains, movement, and excretions. He {{is said to have}} measured a patient's pulse when taking a case history to discover whether the patient was lying. Hippocrates extended clinical observations into family history and environment. [...] "To him medicine <b>owes</b> <b>the</b> art of clinical inspection and observation." [...] For this reason, he may more properly be termed as the [...] "Father of Medicine".|$|E
500|$|A phrase {{sometimes}} {{attributed to}} Hanna is: [...] "No man {{in public office}} <b>owes</b> <b>the</b> public anything". [...] This phrase supposedly appeared in a letter by Hanna to Ohio Attorney General David K. Watson in 1890, urging him to drop {{a lawsuit against the}} Standard Oil Company. [...] The phrase became an issue against Hanna in the 1897 campaign in Ohio. [...] Watson, a Republican, denied that Hanna had written the phrase, but refused to discuss the matter further with reporters. Hanna's early biographers, Croly and Beer, found the supposed quote dubious but as they did not definitely deny that Hanna had written it, a number of later works attribute the quote to Hanna. [...] However, Professor Thomas E. Felt, who wrote an article about the controversy, believed Hanna unlikely to use such an inflammatory phrase to a man with whom he was not close, and which, in any event, did not accurately represent his political views.|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} {{appearance}} in over three months on 3 May 2009, Barton was sent off late in a 3–0 loss to Liverpool at Anfield for a sliding challenge on Xabi Alonso. The red card ruled Barton out of Newcastle's remaining three matches of the season, with the club in danger of relegation from the Premier League. Newcastle manager Alan Shearer raised doubts about Barton's future at the club, saying [...] "I {{think it would be}} wrong to discuss his future now, but I'm not very happy." [...] On 5 May, Newcastle United announced the suspension of Barton indefinitely, and Barton was told to stay away from the club. As a result, Barton's future at Newcastle United was put in doubt. The club suspension was widely reportedly to have resulted not directly from the red card, but from a dressing room confrontation with Shearer and assistant manager Iain Dowie following the match. Shearer said he made a mistake putting Barton back into the team, and that his tackle was [...] "a coward's tackle", to which Barton replied that he was [...] "the best player at the club", and Shearer had to play him. Shearer said that Barton was not, and that he was [...] "shit". Barton replied that Shearer was [...] "a shit manager with shit tactics". When Dowie intervened, Barton called him [...] "a prick". Barton was reportedly transfer listed, with former manager Sam Allardyce reported to have been interested in taking Barton to Blackburn Rovers. Barton's counsellor has said that Barton [...] "would love to work with Alan Shearer again" [...] and [...] "feels very much that he <b>owes</b> <b>the</b> club and the fans." ...|$|E
