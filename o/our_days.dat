25|$|As {{previously}} stated, Romanesque architecture style reached Portugal {{by the end}} of the 11th {{century by}} the hand of Cluniac, Cistercian and Augustinian orders, bringing with them the monastical reforms that were already underway in their countries of origin.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} works of Abhinavagupta is Īśvarapratyabhijñā-vimarśini ("Commentary to the Verses on the Recognition of the Lord") and Īśvarapratyabhijñā-vivṛti-vimarśini ("Commentary on the explanation of Īśvarapratyabhijñā"). This treatise is fundamental in the transmission of the Pratyabhijña school (the branch of Kashmir Shaivism based on direct recognition of the Lord) to <b>our</b> <b>days.</b> Another commentary on a Pratyabhijña work – Śivadṛṣtyā-locana ("Light on Śivadṛṣṭi") – is now lost. Another lost commentary is Padārthapraveśa-nirṇaya-ṭīkā and Prakīrṇkavivaraṇa ("Comment on the Notebook") referring to the third chapter of Vākyapadīya of Bhartrihari. Two more philosophical texts of Abhinavagupta are Kathāmukha-tilaka("Ornament of the Face of Discourses") and Bhedavāda-vidāraṇa ("Confrontation of the Dualist Thesis").|$|E
25|$|Although {{much of the}} cloisters in Portuguese {{churches and}} cathedrals have been {{extensively}} remodelled in later centuries, original Romanesque ones still survived, some almost completely preserved, others {{in various states of}} ruin. In contrast to their French counterparts, they often have suffered less modern intervention, and as a result, their current state is more likely to reflect their original arrangement and to preserve more fully the character of the visual imagery found there. Most arcades and masonry walls of the cloister carries simple wooden shed roofs as barrel or groin vaulted ceilings weren't common or likely didn't survived into <b>our</b> <b>days.</b> When ribbed vaults were introduced, the columns were articulated by multiple applied shafts, with smaller arcades in the openings to the garth.|$|E

25|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the reality throughout most of Europe, there are still some examples of Portuguese Romanesque civil architecture that survived to <b>our</b> <b>days,</b> specially the fortified noble residences or Domus Fortis (in Portuguese:"Casa-Torre"). Most are no longer more than single towers that stand out from more modern constructions carried out in the house that surrounds them, and many were remodelled in later Gothic and Renaissance styles, but their Romanesque features are still very much visible. These noble fortified manors were built within, or in the periphery, of feudal lands (Coutos or Honras), among agricultural fertile valleys. We can also find them in neighbouring areas of forests or mountain ranges where nobility could control new farm lands outside more occupied regions in which the purchase of new lands and titles was more difficult.|$|E
25|$|Descent {{from the}} Talmudic {{tradition}} is the defining feature of Rabbinic Judaism. In Rabbinic Judaism {{it is commonly}} believed that the oral traditions codified in the Oral Torah were co-given with the Written Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai. This belief has, in contrast, been rejected by the Sadducees and Hellenistic Jews during the Second Temple period, the Karaites and Sabbateans during the early and later medieval period, and in the modern non-Orthodox denominations: Reform Judaism sees all scripture as derived from human experience of the divine, Conservative Judaism holds that {{at the very least}} some of the oral law is man-made, and Reconstructionist Judaism denies the very idea of revelation. The vast majority of Jews today come from a Rabbinic Jewish background. Karaite Judaism is considered the main contrast to Rabbinic Judaism in <b>our</b> <b>days,</b> but even though Karaites constituted close to half of the global Jewish population around the early 2nd millennium CE, today there but a few tens of thousands left.|$|E
25|$|The Merchants Club in the Bolshaya Dmitrovka {{existed for}} 70 years from 1839 till 1909. The {{building}} was left untouched {{for the first}} 15 years. In 1855 the staterooms were expanded. The space was transformed with newly built archways (the motif developed in <b>our</b> <b>days</b> by the architects who designed the capital reconstruction of the building). In 1909 the Club {{moved to a new}} building in the Malaya Dmitrovka (occupied by the Lenkom Theatre today) which was specially planned for its uses by the architect Illarion Ivanov-Sсhitz. At the end of the 19th century the Myatlev’s estate was bought by the Cloth-leather Factory Partnership of Alexey Bakhrushin and sons. The founder of the Partnership and the merchant dynasty Alexey Bakhrushin had died by that time. His sons, the honorable citizens of Moscow, Pyotr, Vasily and Alexander had become the owners of the mansion and garden in Bolshaya Dmitrovka. Alexander’s son Alexey was later to found the first Theatre Museum in the world (now A.A.Bakhrushin State Central Theatre Museum).|$|E

25|$|In 1868, the horse-drawn tram company Compañía de Tranvías al Paso del Molino y Cerro {{created the}} first lines {{connecting}} Montevideo with Unión, the beach resort of Capurro and the industrialized and economically independent Villa del Cerro, at the time called Cosmopolis. In the same year, the Mercado del Puerto was inaugurated. In 1869, the first railway line of the company Ferrocarril Central del Uruguay was inaugurated connecting Bella Vista with the town of Las Piedras. During the same year and the next, the neighbourhoods Colón, Nuevo París and La Comercial were founded. The famous to <b>our</b> <b>days</b> Sunday market of Tristán Narvaja Street was established in Cordón in 1870. Public water supply was established in 1871. In 1878, Bulevar Circunvalación was constructed, a boulevard starting from Punta Carretas, {{going up to the}} north end of the city and then turning west to end at the beach of Capurro. It was renamed to Artigas Boulevard (its current name) in 1885. By Decree, on 8 January 1881, the area Los Pocitos was incorporated to the Novísima Ciudad (Most New City).|$|E
500|$|Gens {{started a}} {{theater in the}} ghetto, where poetry {{readings}} {{as well as the}} production of new and old plays took place. Gens continued the policy of supporting the ghetto library and in March 1943 he ordered that all ghetto residents should turn their privately owned books over to the library, except for textbooks and prayer books. He also set up a ghetto publishing house. Nothing was ever published, but the authors were paid for their manuscripts. An archive of historical documents relating to the ghetto was set up. The ghetto had a symphony orchestra, the formation of which owed some impetus to Gens and his police force. Gens justified these cultural activities by claiming that the Jewish administration [...] "wanted to give man the chance to be free of the ghetto for a few hours, and we succeeded in this. <b>Our</b> <b>days</b> here are harsh and grim. Our body is here in the ghetto, but they have not broken our spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|The Ludys {{argue that}} one's love {{life should be}} both guided by and {{subordinate}} to one's relationship with God.

The Ludys contest the definition of [...] "true love" [...] as an emotion; instead, they define [...] "true love" [...] as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that [...] "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending <b>our</b> <b>days</b> meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others... our deepest needs are met as well!" ...|$|E
