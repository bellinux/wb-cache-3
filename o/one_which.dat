5|$|A {{particular}} {{definition of}} Mitică and mitici {{was adopted by}} many inhabitants of Transylvania, who used the terms in reference to either Bucharest-based politicians or inhabitants of the city at large, and contrasted them with their counterparts to the northwest. The character has thus evolved to include a stereotypical view of contemporary Bucharesters or Wallachians, <b>one</b> <b>which</b> depicts them as , arrogant, aggressive and cunning. In other contexts, the mitici {{may be seen as}} not having an adequate familiarity with the culture of Transylvania, and are associated with the Balkans (whereas Transylvania is identified with Central Europe).|$|E

When he traveled, he used two private railroad cars, named the Carolina and the Virginia. Other railroad presidents used only <b>one,</b> <b>which</b> made Harrison's practice unique. The Carolina was a sleeping car and the Virginia was set up to serve members of the Board of Directors, with a kitchen, dining room, and observation area.|$|E

The noxious odours have been associated with nausea and headaches, as well as with contact dermatitis reported in both humans and sheep, who also developed weakness and paralysis. It contains a quinone irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as active quassinoids (ailanthone itself being <b>one)</b> <b>which</b> may account for these effects, but they have, however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in humans and goats. In one trial a tincture from the blossom and foliage caused nausea, vomiting and muscular relaxation.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} he was a {{messenger}} of God, and he used the term Manifestation of God to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God. In the Bahá'í writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization. The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold station; <b>one</b> <b>which</b> is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and <b>one</b> <b>which</b> is human in that they represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that God will never manifest his essence into the world.|$|E
5|$|Besides, {{there were}} a number of small posterns. The heads and limbs of {{executed}} criminals were regularly displayed above the ports. Of the six ports, the Netherbow was the only <b>one</b> <b>which</b> took the form of a large fortified gateway. Repairs to the Netherbow are recorded in 1538, and a drawing of 1544 shows the Netherbow as a wide arched gate flanked by two round towers. In 1571, the gateway between the towers was rebuilt, and a central clock tower was added above the gateway, topped by an octagonal stone spire. This structure was repaired in the early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Cairano was {{undoubtedly}} {{affected by this}} period of sudden and profound decay, if {{only because of the}} sharp decline in commissions. After a decade of intense activity with several overlapping projects, a new stage in his career began, <b>one</b> <b>which</b> is obscured from the documentary view. The last relevant document in this regard is the contract for the entrance to the Duomo of Chiari in 1513, while the next document, in 1517, states that Cairano was already dead. Apart from this, there are other works from the period attributed to him, including the complex question of the completion of the Martinengo mausoleum.|$|E
