5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph <b>of</b> <b>odd</b> order (having an odd number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of even degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an odd number of even degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices <b>of</b> <b>odd</b> degree. Finally, the even number <b>of</b> <b>odd</b> vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E

On June 23, 1903, he married Dorothy Brower (November 14, 1882 to March 10, 1947). They had three children—David Murrell Barkley (1906–1983), Marion Frances Barkley (1909–1996), and Laura Louise Barkley (1911–1987). Laura Louise married Douglas MacArthur II, a U.S. diplomat and nephew of General Douglas MacArthur.|$|E

The first city hall was opened in late 1901, at a cost of $2,000; the building also housed the city's fire department, and later the first public library in 1907. Electrical and water supply systems were both inaugurated in 1906, alongside the construction of a high school building.|$|E

After making his first-grade debut in Sydney district cricket at the age of 16, he made his first-class debut for New South Wales at the age of 20 in 1928–29. However, Fingleton struggled to establish himself at interstate level, and was unable to maintain a regular position in the team, playing in only seven matches in his first three seasons.|$|E

5|$|Gauze is {{reputed to}} have {{originated}} in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal (Ascalon). Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric {{that had been}} made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use <b>of</b> <b>odd</b> numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.|$|E

5|$|Numismatist Bruce C. Goldstein {{indicated}} that several factors combined {{to keep the}} nickel three-cent piece in decline {{after the passage of}} the 1873 act. Less and less fractional currency was being redeemed, as almost a decade had passed since the issuance of three-cent notes. Rich silver strikes in the West lowered the price of that metal to the point where old silver coins emerged from hoarding and circulated again. These factors, combined with ample stocks of cents and nickels, made the three-cent nickel, a non-silver coin <b>of</b> <b>odd</b> denomination, less desirable. By 1876, the mintage for circulation had declined to 162,000. None were struck for circulation in 1877 and 1878, though some proof coins were minted for sale to the public.|$|E
5|$|Taking a {{negative}} real number b to a rational power u/v, where u/v is in lowest terms, yields a positive real result if u is even, and hence v is odd, because then b'u is positive; and yields {{a negative}} real result, if u and v are both odd, because then b'u is negative. The case <b>of</b> <b>odd</b> u and even v cannot be treated this way within the reals, {{since there is}} no real number x such that , the value of b'u/v in this case must use the imaginary unit i, as described more fully in the section § Powers of complex numbers.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} an atom {{will have no}} spin when it has even numbers of both {{neutrons}} and protons, but for other cases <b>of</b> <b>odd</b> numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of thermal equilibrium. However, for certain elements (such as xenon-129) {{it is possible to}} polarize a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction—a condition called hyperpolarization. This has important applications in magnetic resonance imaging.|$|E

40|$|Ordered Decision Diagrams (ODDs) as a {{means for}} the {{representation}} of Boolean functions are used in many applications in CAD. Depending on the decomposition type, various classes <b>of</b> <b>ODDs</b> have been defined, the most important being the Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs), the Ordered Functional Decision Diagrams (OFDDs) and the Ordered Kronecker Functional Decision Diagrams (OKFDDs). In this paper we clarify the computational power of OKFDDs versus OBDDs and OFDDs from a (more) theoretical point of view. We prove several exponential gaps between specific types <b>of</b> <b>ODDs.</b> Combining these results it follows that a restriction of the OKFDD concept to subclasses, such as OBDDs and OFDDs as well, results in families of functions which lose their efficient representation...|$|R

5|$|Rymkus {{was born}} in Royalton, Illinois, {{the son of a}} Lithuanian {{immigrant}} coal miner who owned a small grocery store.

With family finances tight, he took a number <b>of</b> <b>odd</b> jobs, including working as a laborer and delivering newspapers and groceries. At the suggestion of a friend, Rymkus attended Tilden Tech, now known as Tilden High School, and began to display talent as a lineman on the school's football team. He blocked a kick and scored a touchdown in a game at Chicago's Soldier Field in 1936 against rival Austin High, a play he later said was the most memorable of his high school career. Rymkus won seven letters at Tilden playing on the football, track and wrestling teams. As a senior, he defeated Rudy Mucha to win the Chicago prep-school wrestling title.|$|E
