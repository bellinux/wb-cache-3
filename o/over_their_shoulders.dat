5|$|In the Jamiltepec {{region of}} Mexico, there exists {{perhaps the most}} {{colorful}} version {{of that kind of}} dance, the Chareos dance. It represents a battle between Moors, led by Pilate, and Christians, led by James, the apostle. Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer who plays the part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, white cotton square <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders,</b> velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete. In addition, the leader has a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two red flags and two white flags, red symbolizing the blood spilt by James' soldiers and white symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory. The sounds of drums and flutes accompany the dance. These dances that pit Christian against Moor are almost certainly Christianized versions of earlier, pre-Cortez dances that ritualized the battle between the tiger and the eagle.|$|E
25|$|Tilt-and-roll luggage or wheeled luggage, is {{a variant}} of luggage for {{travelers}} which typically contains two-fixed wheels on one end and a telescoping handle on the opposite end for vertical movement. Tilt-and-roll luggage is pulled and thus eliminates a traveler from directly carrying his or her luggage. In 1988, Northwest Airlines pilot Robert Plath invented tilt-and-roll luggage as travelers beforehand had to carry suitcases in their hands, toss garment bags <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders,</b> or strap luggage on top of metal carts.|$|E

Back in Melbourne, Spry employed Carole West to organise a publicity shoot for TV and press to display his band having their long hair done at a women's hair salon in South Yarra. During the shoot, Burns sang with his guitar and was joined by apprentice hairdresser Lynne Randell – who was promptly signed by Spry and managed by West. In January 1965, they supported The Rolling Stones and Roy Orbison on their first Australian tour.|$|E

Ant shot off towards the rear of the train, before stopping by a cattle truck. Bozděch tried to open it up, but it was locked. He banged on it in the hope someone was already inside and was surprised when it was opened, revealing that the only people inside were a woman and her two daughters. The reason why Ant had been attracted to that particular carriage, was because one of the girls had been eating chocolate at the time. When she later offered him a piece, he didn't wait for it to be melted like when he was a puppy, but instead ate it excitedly.|$|E

Grimm says that the evidence for this [...] "is plain from the figure itself. No change of the moon could suggest the image of two children with a pail slung <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Moreover, to this day the Swedish people see in the spots of the moon two persons carrying a big bucket on a pole."

500|$|Fillmore oversaw two highly {{competent}} Secretaries of State, Daniel Webster, {{and after}} the New Englander's 1852 death, Edward Everett, looking <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> and making all major decisions. The president was particularly active in Asia and the Pacific, {{especially with regard to}} Japan, which at this time still prohibited nearly all foreign contact. American merchants and shipowners wanted Japan [...] "opened up" [...] for trade. [...] This would allow not only commerce, but permit American ships to call there for food and water, and in emergencies without being punished. They were concerned that American sailors cast away on the Japanese coast were imprisoned as criminals. [...] Fillmore and Webster dispatched Commodore Matthew C. Perry to open Japan to relations with the outside world, by force if necessary. Though the commodore did not reach Japan until after the end of Fillmore's term, Fillmore ordered the Perry Expedition.|$|E

500|$|It is unlikely, {{given the}} {{attitude}} of the Otago Rugby Union to the Natives before their departure, that they would have dismissed the allegations if incriminating evidence had existed. The side was back to full strength following the return of their suspended players when the side faced Otago in Dunedin. The Natives outscored their opponents five tries to two, and won 11–8. The side's star player and half-back, Keogh, stayed in Dunedin when the team departed for Christchurch. The side faced Hawke's Bay, who were touring, in Christchurch, and handily defeated them 13–2. The Natives' play was praised by The Press: [...] "... the wearers of the black passed with remarkable accuracy and quickness between their legs, <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders,</b> under their arms and with their feet". The side then faced Canterbury on 17 August, who they thrashed 15–0. The report published in The Press said of the Natives' performance: ...|$|E

Fillmore began planning an expedition to Japan in 1850, but the expedition, led by Commodore Matthew C. Perry, did not leave until November 1852. Though the Perry Expedition did not reach Japan until after Fillmore's presidency, it served as the catalyst for the end of Japan's isolationist policy.|$|E

His sister, Mona Simpson, described his death thus: [...] "Steve's final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times.

A small private funeral was held on October 7, 2011, the details of which were not revealed out of respect for Jobs's family. At the time of his death, his biological mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, was living in a nursing home and suffering from dementia. She was not told that he died.|$|E
2500|$|The 15th Hussars charged, {{over about}} [...] of snowy, frozen ground, {{shouting}} [...] "Emsdorf and Victory!" [...] It {{was so cold}} the hussars wore their pelisses, rather than having them slung <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and many had cloaks over all. Eyewitnesses also spoke of numbed hands hardly able to grasp reins and sabres. The impact when the hussars met the chasseurs was terrible, as one British officer recorded: [...] "horses and men were overthrown and a shriek of terror, intermixed with oaths, groans and prayers for mercy issued from the whole extent of their front." [...] The impetus of the British hussars carried them {{through the ranks of}} the chasseurs and into those of the dragoons behind. The French force was broken, and it routed eastwards with the British in pursuit. Many French cavalrymen (though the chasseurs were largely of German origin) were taken prisoner at very little cost to the 15th Hussars. Two French lieutenant colonels were captured and the chasseurs, who lost many men captured, ceased to exist as a viable regiment. The 10th Hussars came up during the pursuit, however, they were initially mistaken for French cavalry. This caused the 15th Hussars to break off their pursuit to re-form, ending the action.|$|E
