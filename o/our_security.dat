25|$|In , ElBaradei {{said that}} the {{changing}} landscape of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament may be defined {{by the emergence of}} an extensive black market in nuclear material and equipment, the proliferation of nuclear weapons and sensitive nuclear technology, and the stagnation in nuclear disarmament.

ElBaradei also stated that only one percent of the money spent to develop new weapons would be enough to feed the entire world and that, if we hope to escape self-destruction, nuclear weapons should have no place in our collective conscience and no role in <b>our</b> <b>security.</b>|$|E
25|$|In early July 2017, Israel′s defence {{minister}} Avigdor Liberman {{said that while}} ″the rebels are not our friends, they are all versions of al-Qaida”, Israel could not allow a man like Assad to remain in power: “Keeping Assad in power is not in <b>our</b> <b>security</b> interests. As long as he is in power, Iran and Hezbollah will be in Syria.” He said that Israel {{had no interest in}} entering the Syrian civil war, but there were ″red lines″ Israel had set, such as the smuggling of sophisticated weaponry to Hezbollah and Iran′a presence on its borders. Later in July 2017, the Israeli government said it opposed the cease-fire agreement in southern Syria that the United States and Russia had reached a week prior that envisaged establishing de-escalation zones along Syria’s borders with both Jordan and Israel, as that would legalise Iran′s presence in Syria.|$|E
