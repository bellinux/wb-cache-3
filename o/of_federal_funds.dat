5|$|This {{compliance}} requirements {{is one of}} {{the most}} important sections, because it covers cost accounting policies, expenses and expenditures, and actual use <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> to administer a federal assistance program.

5|$|Earmarking is a {{requirement}} that specifies a limit amount or percentage of the program’s assistance that must (minimum) or may (maximum) be used for specified activities. Examples of this include limits imposed {{on the federal government}} on the amount <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> to cover administrative expenses, or a percentage requirement for total program funds provided to subrecipients. Earmarking may also be specified in relation to the types of participants covered (e.g. a limit on how many participants a recipient can provide assistance to).|$|E

The declaration permitted use <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> for recovery. The Federal Emergency Management Agency provided an average relief fund of $2,128 (1984USD, $4,147 2006USD) per affected person, the smallest return rate for a declared disaster in the Virgin Islands.|$|E
5|$|This section covers 3 {{compliance}} requirements concerning recipient performance. They {{may require}} that recipients provide {{a level of}} contributions to a federal program, maintain specific levels of performance or achievement, or restrict the amount <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> used for a specific purpose. Failure to meet these requirements may result in either limitation of future funds or termination of assistance. Specific requirements for matching, level of effort, and earmarking are unique to each federal program, and are described in the laws, regulations, and contract or grant provisions that pertain to the program.|$|E
5|$|Title to real {{property}} acquired by recipients with federal awards vests with the recipient. It {{must be used}} for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose. Real property may be used in other federally sponsored projects or programs that have purposes similar to the one the property was bought for, as long as the federal government authorizes it. However it may not dispose of or encumber the title to {{real property}} without prior federal government consent. When it is no longer needed for the federally supported programs or projects, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the federal government. As with equipment, if the property is sold, a proportionate share is provided to the federal government, amount of the current fair market value, based on the percent <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> to own recipient's fund used to acquire the item.|$|E

5|$|By about a {{week after}} the passage of the hurricane, President George W.

The disaster declaration allocated the use <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> for rebuilding and providing aid in the aftermath of hurricane Isabel. By about four months after the passage of the hurricane, disaster aid totaled about $516million (2003USD, $ USD), primarily in North Carolina and Virginia. Over 166,000 residents applied for individual assistance, with about $117million (2003USD, $ USD) approved for residents to assist with temporary housing and home repairs. About 50,000business owners applied for Small Business Administration loans, with about $178million (2003USD, $ USD) approved for the assistance loans. About 40,000people visited local disaster recovery centers, designed to provide additional information regarding the aftermath of the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{worked with}} Republicans {{to shift the}} source <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> from taxes to tariffs. He {{believed}} the taxation of alcohol spread the burdens of taxation unfairly, especially as concerned his constituents, who included several distillers. He also believed the income tax, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried before a federal district court. He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the average American, while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive.|$|E
5|$|When Tillman {{entered the}} Senate in 1895, he {{was opposed to}} {{expansion}} of the United States Navy, fearing the expenditure would cause the issuance of bonds by the president, which he felt would only enrich the wealthy. Tillman sat on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and soon {{came to understand that}} South Carolina could benefit from naval appropriations steered towards her. A flow <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> to his home state resulted, beginning in 1900, followed by the establishment, in 1909, of the Charleston Naval Shipyard. Once Democrats took control of the Senate {{for the first time in}} Tillman's tenure, in 1913, he became chairman of the committee and allied with others from the southeast (such as Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, a North Carolinian) to see that the bulk of naval appropriations would be spent there. He also served as chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Claims (57th through 59th Congresses) and on the Committee on Five Civilized Tribes of Indians (61st and 62nd Congresses). Strokes in 1908 and 1910 decreased his influence and ability in the Senate; his seniority entitled him to become Senate Appropriations Committee chairman in 1913, but his health did not permit it.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates how the {{implementation}} of monetary policy affects the dynamics and the volatility <b>of</b> the <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate. Since the early 1980 s, the most important changes in the Fed?s conduct of monetary policy refer to the role <b>of</b> the <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate target and the reserve requirement system. We show that the improved communication and transparency regarding the <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate target has significantly increased the Fed?s influence on the <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate since 1994. By contrast, the declining role of required reserves in the U. S. has contributed to higher <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate volatility. Our {{results suggest that the}} planned introduction of remunerated reserves will further enhance the controllability <b>of</b> the <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate.
