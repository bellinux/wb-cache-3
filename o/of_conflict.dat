40|$|Studies on {{the effects}} <b>of</b> marital <b>conflict</b> and child {{adjustment}} have documented a consistent relationship between higher amounts <b>of</b> marital <b>conflict</b> and increased child adjustment problems. Recently, researchers have focused on viewing children's perceptions <b>of</b> marital <b>conflict</b> as an important variable that may influence {{the strength of the}} association between marital conflict and child adjustment. Recent research has indicated that children's perceptions <b>of</b> interparental <b>conflict</b> may influence overall child adjustment. The present study examined the relationship between marital conflict and child adjustment and the role of children's perceptions <b>of</b> marital <b>conflict</b> in a clinical sample. Forty-four 8 - to 12 -year-old children and one of their parents participated in this study. Adult participants completed four questionnaires: (1) The O'Leary- Porter Scale; (2) The Conflict Tactics Scale; (3) The Child Behavior Checklist; and (4) a demographic questionnaire. The child participants completed one scale, The Children's Perception <b>of</b> Interparental <b>Conflict</b> Scale. The following research questions were investigated: (1) Is parental assessment <b>of</b> marital <b>conflict</b> related to child adjustment in a clinical sample? (2) Are children's appraisals <b>of</b> marital <b>conflict</b> related to child adjustment in a clinical sample? (3) Are boys' appraisals <b>of</b> interparental <b>conflict</b> related to the parents' appraisals <b>of</b> interparental <b>conflict</b> in a clinical sample? (4) Are girls' appraisals <b>of</b> interparental <b>conflict</b> related to the parents' appraisals <b>of</b> interparental <b>conflict</b> in a clinical sample? And (5) Are children's perceptions <b>of</b> marital <b>conflict</b> better predictors <b>of</b> child adjustment than parents' perceptions <b>of</b> marital <b>conflict</b> in a clinical sample?A significant relationship was found between parents' perceptions <b>of</b> marital <b>conflict</b> and child adjustment. However, children's perceptions <b>of</b> marital <b>conflict</b> did not significantly predict their overall adjustment. In accordance with these findings, it was also found that parents' perceptions <b>of</b> marital <b>conflict</b> were better predictors of child adjustment than children's perceptions <b>of</b> marital <b>conflict</b> in a clinical sample. It was also found that boys' appraisals <b>of</b> marital <b>conflict</b> were significantly related to parents' appraisals <b>of</b> marital <b>conflict.</b> Whereas, girls' perceptions <b>of</b> marital <b>conflict</b> were not significantly related to parents' perceptions <b>of</b> marital <b>conflict.</b> Implications and limitations of these findings and recommendations for future research were discussed.
