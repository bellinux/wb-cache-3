40|$|Forces entirely {{apart from}} {{rationality}} shape commercial law. A turn to aesthetics directs {{attention to the}} non-rational elements at play in this law. These suppressed elements privilege commercial actors by deterring consideration of legal limitations on commercial activity that could be socially desirable. Problematic features <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> law take two different forms. First, there are types <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> transactions encouraged by U. S. commercial law the very structures of which raise fairness and efficiency concerns. Second, the sheer volume <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> transactions {{and the lack of}} legal controls requiring market actors to internalize ensuing economic, social and environmental costs raise serious questions about the desirability of laws designed to encourage perpetual escalation <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> activity. These problematic aspects <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> law invoke difficult questions. How do we determine what levels and forms <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> activity are optimal? If commitment to a more balanced approach to commercial activity were possible, who would be helped, who would be harmed, and how? The aesthetics <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> law deters engagement with these questions by informing certain non-rational, pre-reflective dispositions that enable common refrains against reform. Much <b>of</b> contemporary <b>commercial</b> law scholarship employs economic modeling or empiricism. Empirical findings or successful economic models, however, do not automatically become fruitful bases for law reform. Aesthetic elements <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> law affect the capacity to translate the results of analytical approaches (quantitative or otherwise) into law reform. Recognizing the aesthetics <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> law is crucial as professionals applaud U. S. commercial law 2 ̆ 7 s facilitation <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> activity here and superiority for attracting investment abroad...|$|R
