25|$|Esch ran up an {{impressive}} string of wins, mostly by knockout, before being stopped in two rounds by Mitchell Rose on December 15, 1995. Butterbean took the loss {{with a shrug}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> and went on the road, barnstorming around the United States and winning fifty-one consecutive matches, with his best win coming against Peter McNeeley. While {{the majority of his}} opponents were technically limited club-level fighters early in his career, he did move up the ranks to win the IBA Super Heavyweight Championship on April 12, 1997 with a second round technical knockout of Ed White at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. He made five successful title defences before relinquishing his championship in 2000.|$|E
500|$|The {{main event}} was a Ladder {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, {{involving}} the champion, Jeff Jarrett, and the challenger, Jeff Hardy. Scott Hall interfered with the match by hitting Hardy with the Outsider's Edge. While Hardy and Jarrett were both {{at the top of}} a ladder trying to grab the belt, Kevin Nash, an ally of Hardy's, entered the arena with two guitars over both <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> and handed a guitar to Hall. The two men then began to bash Hardy with the guitars until Jarrett broke a guitar over Hardy's head. Jarrett then retrieved the championship belt from the holder above the ring to win the match. Following the match, Jarrett, Nash, and Hall challenged the TNA roster to fight them. A.J. Styles and the 3Live Kru (Ron Killings, B.G. James, and Konnan) answered their challenge, but failed to win the fight. The video feed changed from the ring [...] to a black limousine outside of the venue that showed a man in a black coat step out and walk into the arena. Randy Savage then made his debut in the company and walked to ringside as the event came to a close.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the attack}} on Peck's ranch the Apaches {{continued}} on towards Sycamore Canyon and the nearby homesteads, some twenty miles south of Arivaca. One of the homesteads was the cattle ranch of John [...] "Yank" [...] Bartlett and his partner Henry [...] "Hank" [...] Hewitt, located {{at the head of}} the canyon. On April 28, the day after the attack at Peck's ranch, a local man named Phil Shanahan was visiting the Bartlett ranch where his ten-year-old son, Little Phil Shanahan, was staying with Johnny Bartlett, the son of Yank Bartlett. Eventually Shanahan decided to ride back to his ranch, a few miles away, leaving his son, Little Phil, at the Bartlett ranch. Shortly after that the boys heard gunfire in the distance and then Shanahan stumbled back into view of the ranch house saying he had been shot. Yank could tell by the wound that Shanahan needed a doctor so he told his son Johnny to ride to Oro Blanco to get help and alarm the townspeople. Yank also told Little Phil to go back to his home and warn his mother and his sisters. Phil made it to his house without incident and he took his family into the mountains where they hid until the following day. But, while the Shanahans were in hiding, the raiders attacked their house, stealing food, clothing and killing some cattle. Not long after Johnny left, he discovered three men [...] "dressed in black and acting as if they were drunk." [...] Afraid, Johnny turned around and went back, only to find that the Apaches had arrived and were firing into the house. Johnny rode through the firing to the door of the house, he was not hurt but his horse was wounded and died in the doorway. Yank returned the Apache's fire, while at the same time trying to tend to Shanahan's wound, and received a bullet to one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> but he remained conscious and continued to fight. When it was dark, Yank sent Johnny out to ride to Oro Blanco again.|$|E

2500|$|In League, University and Army cricket Tyson {{had used}} a 'short' run up of 18 or 20 yards {{consisting}} of ten short steps and ten long final strides to the wicket. When he moved to first class cricket this increased to 38 yards, starting near the sightscreen and over 200 feet from the wicket-keeper, who was often reduced to an athletic long stop. With a final leap to the wicket he released the ball with a high arm action and a heave <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> 'the ferocity of his delivery' was described as 'every muscle is in use, the right foot takes the strain, the right arm is straight ready for delivery and the left leg kicks out menacingly'. Australian newspapers had accused Tyson of dragging his right foot over the popping crease on the 1954–55 tour and an English newspaper responded; [...] "Will Tyson be [...] "sacrificed" [...] to avoid any risk of giving the Australians a chance to scream that Tyson persistently bowls no-balls by foot-drag over the crease?" [...] with pictures of his bowling action. In the match between the Victoria and the M.C.C he was photographed dragging his foot 18 inches past the crease, but Pat Crawford of New South Wales was photographed with his foot 36 inches over the crease. The caption reading [...] "Oh Tyson. You are an Angel compared to Pat!" [...] An enterprising Sydney newspaper paid Harold Larwood {{to give his name}} to an article declaring [...] "Replay Tests – Tyson Not Fair". Unlike the great swing [...] bowler Fred Trueman he 'bowled straight and...never intentionally bowled an out-swinger. Instead Tyson relied on his tremendous pace to take most of his wickets, batsmen were often caught in mid-stroke by the speed of the ball coming onto the bat, or were too nervous to play fluently. On a green or crumbling wicket providing movement he could simply blast his way through the batting, and produced bounce and pace even off the placid Northamptonshire wickets. Tyson believed that a bouncer should 'pin the batsman against the sightscreen' and frequently used them to intimidate batsmen, even tailenders His ungainly action and quest for raw speed took a toll on even his strong body and he suffered from a series of injuries which brought a premature end to his career. In 1994 he had operations to his right arm and knees and a further operation on his knees in 2001 rendered him practically immobile for a short time. As he put it himself [...] "to bowl fast is to revel in the glad animal action, to thrill in physical power and to enjoy a sneaking feeling of superiority over the mortals who play the game". However, he was no simple bowler, but thought hard how to dismiss and deceive batsman. John Arlott wrote [...] "This was intelligence, rhythm and strength merged into the violent craft of fast bowling" [...] and [...] "He is intelligent beyond the usual run of fast bowlers: he is the type of cricketer whom improves rapidly through thinking about the game".|$|E
