40|$|Some ZZ Ceti {{and rapidly}} {{oscillating}} Ap stars show {{a kind of}} multiperiodic behaviour, with among <b>others</b> <b>prominent</b> peaks in their power spectra at harmonically spaced frequencies with ratios 1 : 2 : 4. The nonlinear interaction between three such modes {{is a combination of}} two coupled second{harmonic interactions. The amplitude equations are shown by a Painleve analysis to be nonintegrable in the hamiltonian sense, so that one expects for the longterm behaviour irregular or chaotic phenomena instead of simple periodic or multiperiodic pulsations, especially when other modes and dissipation are included. An example of stars to which this might apply is G 191 - 16 among the variable white dwarfs. 1 1 Introduction In some variable stars amplitudes of individual pulsation modes vary with time, indicative of some kind of nonlinear mode coupling.
