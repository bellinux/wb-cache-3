Lazzara said: [...] "One day he [...] {{called me and}} was like, 'Hey, man, {{what do you think}} about us going back to our original lineup?' And I was like, 'Are you crazy? I haven't talked to John [...] in, like, seven years. I don't know if he'd want to do it.'" [...] O'Connell continued to insist on the idea, [...] "and then I got a call from John ... it felt like no time had passed ... like we had just talked a few days ago". The pair did not discuss creating music initially, instead [...] " [...] reacquainted with what had been going <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> lives.

UGO.com ranked Kim 59th on the website's {{list of the}} 75 [...] "hottest" [...] animated characters, hailing her as the [...] "Disney Channel queen". In 2015, MTV published an article entitled [...] "13 Reasons Kim Possible is the Only Role Model You Need", citing the character's [...] "great friends, a great boyfriend and a kick-ass career". In Oh My Disney's article [...] "Why We Want To Be Kim Possible", the character was hailed as [...] "the best" [...] because [...] "Who else could be a straight-A student, captain of the cheerleading team, AND protect the world from bad guys? The answer is no one, because she’s Kim Poss-ib-le." [...] The same website also included the character in its article [...] "Disney Redheads: An Appreciation Post". Kim is also regarded as a fashion trendsetter, with Charmaine Simmons of Bustle crediting the character with popularizing [...] "all of the stylish looks that we never knew we'd {{be in love with}} over 10 years later", including crop tops, cargo pants and bodysuits. Also writing for Bustle, Sarah Freymiller penned, [...] "Her commitment to action is notable, even if she never wears a shirt longer than mid-lung, and she fights crime in her cheerleader uniform when she needs to." [...] Freymiller concluded, [...] "In the early 2000s, as Limited Too dominated the tween fashion scene, it was refreshing to see a girl decked out in functional black and army green attire." [...] The character's Kimmunicator ringtone is commonly associated with the series, and is also frequently imitated by fans. The Kimmunicator's inception preceded the creation of smartphones by several years. Upon Apple's release of the Apple Watch, several critics drew similarities between the real-life device and the Kimmunicator, especially when Kim's device was downsized to a wristwatch during the final season.|$|E

As previously indicated U.S. President Obama had chosen to avoid the use of the word genocide in order to avoid upending recent pledges of a closer partnership with Turkey but for many the use of the Armenian term Meds Yeghern, translated as “Great Calamity”, did little to placate critics within the country.|$|E

2500|$|Alex Rosenberg {{makes an}} {{extrapolation}} of physical determinism as inferred on the macroscopic scale by the behaviour {{of a set}} of dominoes to neural activity in the brain where; [...] "If the brain is nothing but a complex physical object whose states are as much governed by physical laws as any other physical object, then what goes <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> heads is as fixed and determined by prior events as what goes on when one domino topples another in a long row of them." [...] Physical determinism is currently disputed by prominent interpretations of quantum mechanics, and while not necessarily representative of intrinsic indeterminism in nature, fundamental limits of precision in measurement are inherent in the uncertainty principle. The relevance of such prospective indeterminate activity to free will is, however, contested, even when chaos theory is introduced to magnify the effects of such microscopic events.|$|E
2500|$|The Eastern church {{then saw}} the {{development}} of monasticism and the mystical contributions of Gregory of Nyssa, Evagrius Ponticus and Pseudo-Dionysius. Monasticism, also known as anchoritism (meaning [...] "to withdraw") {{was seen as an}} alternative to martyrdom, and was less about escaping the world than about fighting demons (who were thought to live in the desert) and about gaining liberation from our bodily passions in order to be open to the Word of God. Anchorites practiced continuous meditation on the scriptures as a means of climbing the ladder of perfection—a common religious image in the Mediterranean world and one found in Christianity through the story of Jacob's ladder—and sought to fend off the demon of acedia ("un-caring"), a boredom or apathy that prevents us from continuing <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> spiritual training. Anchorites could live in total solitude ("hermits", from the word erēmitēs, [...] "of the desert") or in loose communities ("cenobites", meaning [...] "common life").|$|E
2500|$|Noting {{the growing}} union support, {{an article in}} the progressive-leaning Mother Jones {{magazine}} said that union support could splinter and derail the protests rather than sustain them because while unions are tightly organized, hierarchical, and run with a clear chain of command, Occupy Wall Street is the opposite in that they are [...] "a horizontal, autonomous, leaderless, modified-consensus-based system with roots in anarchist thought." [...] However, the article went on to suggest that if the unions and OWS joined together they could work to create a progressive movement that [...] "effectively taps into the rising feeling among many Americans that economic opportunity has been squashed by corporate greed and the influence of the very rich in politics." [...] As the success of the movement has become apparent, union organizers have begun to embrace some of their social media skills, bold tactics, and the simplicity of the 99% slogan. Damon Silvers, the AFL–CIO's policy director, said, “We think the Occupy movement has given voice to something very basic about what’s going <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> country right now. The fact that they’ve figured out certain concepts and language for doing that, we think is really important and positive.” The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) has endorsed the movement saying, [...] "We recognize the need to work together and learn from each other. The vitality, energy and dialogue growing from the Occupy Wall Street movement show the potential to organize, build power and win justice for the middle class.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Michigan Tech hosted Wisconsin for a two-game series the {{following}} weekend {{to open its}} WCHA conference schedule, but did so without junior defenseman Tommy Brown, who underwent an appendectomy that week. Pearson wanted his team to play with more discipline so as to limit the Badgers' power play chances, and the Huskies responded by taking one penalty through the first two periods of the Friday game. Michigan Tech freshman Tanner Kero opened the scoring {{in the second period}} with his first career goal by deflecting a shot from Riley Sweeney. In the third period, however, the Huskies incurred two consecutive penalties in the first seven minutes, and Wisconsin forward Tyler Barnes beat Josh Robinson for a power play goal. The Huskies outshot the Badgers 16–8 in the third period, but could not put the puck past Landon Peterson to win the game in regulation. Nearly three minutes into the overtime period, Michigan Tech started a dump-and-chase and Peterson stopped the puck behind his net, but he collided with teammate John Ramage while the Huskies forechecked, leaving Jordan Baker to score on an undefended goal and win the game. In the Saturday game, Wisconsin started Joel Rumpel at goaltender and Huskies forwards Kero and Blake Pietila each scored a power play goal on a deflection. Midway through the second period, Wisconsin scored off a rebound after Robinson stopped the initial shot. Michigan Tech killed off a five-minute major penalty to Alex MacLeod in the third period, but the Badgers tied the game with two minutes remaining. Twenty seconds into overtime, however, Huskies captain Brett Olson scored on a wrap-around shot that went through Rumpel's five-hole for the win. Pearson was pleased with his team's performance, saying, [...] "Our kids are working hard, there's {{a lot of good things}} going <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> locker room and we see it every day as coaches". Robinson was named WCHA Defensive Player of the Week after stopping 44 of 47shots in the series.|$|E
