2500|$|The cockpit {{area of the}} Islander had not {{suffered}} significant damage, {{and there}} was sufficient space for the pilot to survive. The pilot's seat belt and shoulder harness were found undamaged and unbuckled, with all stitching intact and the buckle still functional. There {{was no sign of}} impact on the controls or the instrument panel. Both fuel tanks contained a significant amount of fuel, which investigators calculated to be approximately 100 US gallons in each of the two wing tanks, and the fuel selector valve was in the correct position. Several instruments were damaged by the impact or by the pressure and corrosion from sitting on the seabed for six days. The aircraft's horizontal situation indicator, or HSI (a navigational instrument to direct the pilot to or from ground-based navigation aids, including the MAC VOR), was not set properly for the approach. The instrument's course selector was set to 103°, though the approach called for a setting of 115°. A second device on the HSI, called the [...] "heading bug", is a prominent marker for the pilot to set to the desired heading so that when the aircraft is flying that heading, the bug {{is at the top of}} the instrument's display and aligned with a vertical white line. The heading bug on the HSI was set to 157°. A second instrument situated below the HSI and capable of the same VOR navigation, called the <b>omni</b> <b>bearing</b> indicator (OBI), was also set incorrectly to 309° when it too should have been set to 115°.|$|E
50|$|This {{instrument}} display {{can replace}} {{a magnetic compass}} display in the instrument panel, but not necessarily the gyroscopic Heading Indicator. The Heading Indicator can be combined with information from navigation radios (primarily VOR/ILS) in a similar way, to create the Horizontal Situation Indicator. The HSI, along with the VOR system, has largely replaced use of the RMI, however the HSI's much higher cost keeps the older combination of an RMI and an <b>Omni</b> <b>Bearing</b> Indicator attractive to cost-conscious pilots.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As the {{development}} of synergistic technology application into educational fields, synergistic learning and synergistic working have been hot spots. The article discussed the Synergistic technology. It adopted the concept on Resources Constructing Based on Synergistic Technology, and analyzed the standpoint of resources characteristic and the need of resources construction. The platform of Resources Construction Based on Virtual Synergistic Technology designed {{is made up of}} resources constructing, managing and applying. And the resources construction system contains the team of construction, distance synergism & control and constructional pool. Virtual Synergistic Technology The Analysis on Concept: Synergism is the interferential competence about each element, which takes on the coordination and the cooperation of each element in the whole developing process [1]. In short, synergism is about the working together of two things (muscles or drugs for example) to produce an effect greater than the sum of their individual effects. Computer synergistic technology is using the technology of computer network communicating, to organize the more cooperating members and activities from temporal separation and space distribution with interdependent work, aim to complete the same purpose. The synergistic technology achieves the <b>Omni</b> <b>bearing</b> synergism between different systems, different data resources, different terminal unit and different applying situation [2]. Modular team is a new absolutely virtual league composed of human resources, non-human sources and social power in different areas. Each member in team contributes their core abilities to achieve share of technology and resource, and save resource costs...|$|E
