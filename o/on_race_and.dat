The party platform included removal of the Weimar Republic in Germany, rejection {{of the terms of}} the Treaty of Versailles, radical antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism. They promised a strong central government, increased Lebensraum (living space) for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based <b>on</b> <b>race,</b> <b>and</b> racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews, who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.|$|E

Traditionally, mothers were responsible for raising the kids while the father was out providing financially for the family.

Older parents are financially established and generally have fewer problems raising children compared to their teenage counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Heathenry {{emerged in}} the United States during the 1960s. In 1969 the Danish Heathen Else Christensen {{established}} the Odinist Fellowship {{at her home in}} the U.S. state of Florida. Heavily influenced by Mills' writings, she began publishing a magazine, The Odinist, which placed greater emphasis on right-wing and racialist ideas than theological ones. Stephen McNallen first founded the Viking Brotherhood in the early 1970s, before creating the Asatru Free Assembly in 1976, which broke up in 1986 amid widespread political disagreements after McNallen's repudiation of neo-Nazis within the group. In the 1990s, McNallen founded the Asatru Folk Assembly (AFA), an ethnically-oriented Heathen group headquartered in California. Meanwhile, Valgard Murray and his kindred in Arizona founded the Ásatrú Alliance (AA) in the late 1980s, which shared the AFA's perspectives <b>on</b> <b>race</b> <b>and</b> which published the Vor Tru newsletter. In 1987, Stephen Flowers and James Chisholm founded The Troth, which was incorporated in Texas. Taking an inclusive, non-racialist view, it soon grew into an international organisation.|$|E
5|$|The National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP; Nazi Party) was the renamed {{successor}} of the German Workers' Party {{founded in}} 1919, {{one of several}} far-right political parties active in Germany at the time.

They promised a strong central government, increased Lebensraum ("living space") for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based <b>on</b> <b>race</b> <b>and</b> racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews, who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights. The Nazis proposed national and cultural renewal based upon the Völkisch movement.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{deterioration}} of the economy led to the resignation on 27 March 1930 of the coalition government that had been elected in 1928. A new cabinet was formed, and Paul von Hindenburg used his power as president to govern via emergency decrees. He appointed Heinrich Brüning as chancellor. Goebbels {{took charge of the}} NSDAP's national campaign for Reichstag elections called for 14 September 1930. Campaigning was undertaken on a huge scale, with thousands of meetings and speeches held all over the country. Hitler's speeches focused on blaming the country's economic woes on the Weimar Republic, particularly its adherence to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which required war reparations that had proven devastating to the German economy. He proposed a new German society based <b>on</b> <b>race</b> <b>and</b> national unity. The resulting success took even Hitler and Goebbels by surprise: the party received 6.5 million votes nationwide and took 107 seats in the Reichstag, making it the second largest party in the country.|$|E
