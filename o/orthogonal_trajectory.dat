50|$|The {{conformal}} mapping property of analytic functions (at points where the derivative is not zero) {{gives rise to}} a geometric property of harmonic conjugates. Clearly the harmonic conjugate of x is y, and the lines of constant x and constant y are orthogonal. Conformality says that contours of constant u(x,y) and v(x,y) will also be orthogonal where they cross (away from the zeroes of f&prime;(z)). That means that v is a specific solution of the <b>orthogonal</b> <b>trajectory</b> problem for the family of contours given by u (not the only solution, naturally, since we can take also functions of v): the question, going back to the mathematics of the seventeenth century, of finding the curves that cross a given family of non-intersecting curves at right angles.|$|E

In order to have the method working, a condition involving the local width of the duct and the curvatures of the boundary curves must be satisfied. This condition is easily computable, and it should be checked in advance. For illustration several computational examples are included...|$|E

40|$|All normal {{lines of}} a helical {{developable}} Φ have the same distance to its axis a and make the same angle with a. This implies that on coaxial one-sheet hyperboloids of revolution or skew ruled helical surfaces with generators included in the normal-congruence of Φ any <b>orthogonal</b> <b>trajectory</b> of the rulings is located on a translate of Φ. Let line n be the normal of the helical developable Φ at C. When Φ performs a helical motion or rotation about its axis a with constant velocity, then the point C of intersection with the fixed normal line n runs along n with constant velocity, too. The same holds for circular involutes in the plane. This property offers the most simple way to grasp why helical developables serve as tooth flanks for skew gearing according to Jack Phillips (2003) and why the gear ratio is independent from the relative position of their axes. The generators of two conjugate tooth flanks Φ 1 and Φ 2 passing through the instantaneous point C of contact remain parallel to their respective initial position. The corresponding osculating cones of the tooth flanks have axes fixed in the gear box and parallel to the related helical axis...|$|E
