40|$|Maps showing {{potential}} mercury, sulfur, chlorine, {{and moisture}} emissions for U. S. coal by county of origin {{were made from}} publicly available data (plates 1, 2, 3, and 4). Published equations that predict mercury capture by emission control technologies used at U. S. coal-fired utilities were applied to average coal quality values for 169 U. S. counties. The results were used to create five maps that show the influence of coal origin on mercury emissions from utility units with: (1) hot-side electrostatic precipitator (hESP), (2) cold-side electrostatic precipitator (cESP), (3) hot-side electrostatic precipitator with wet flue gas desulfurization (hESP/FGD), (4) cold-side electrostatic precipitator with wet flue gas desulfurization (cESP/FGD), and (5) spray-dry adsorption with fabric filter (SDA/FF) emission controls (plates 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). Net (lower) coal heating values were calculated from measured coal Btu values, and estimated coal moisture and hydrogen values; the net heating values were used to derive mercury emission rates on an electric <b>output</b> basis (<b>plate</b> 10). Results indicate that selection of low-mercury coal is a good mercury control option for plants having hESP, cESP, or hESP/FGD emission controls. Chlorine content is more important for plants having cESP/FGD or SDA/FF controls; optimum mercury capture is indicated where chlorine is between 500 and 1000 ppm. Selection of low-sulfur coal should improve mercury capture where carbon in fly ash is used to reduce mercury emissions. Comparison of in-ground coal quality {{with the quality of}} commercially mined coal indicates that existing coal mining and coal washing practice results in a 25 % reduction of mercury in U.

40|$|Since {{semiconductor}} fabrication processes require numerous steps, {{cost and}} yield are critical concerns. In-situ monitoring is therefore vital for process control. However, {{this goal is}} currently restricted by the shortage of available sensors capable of performing in this manner. The goal of this research therefore, {{was to investigate the}} use of acoustic signals for monitoring and control of semiconductor fabrication equipment and processes. Currently, most methods for process monitoring (such as optical emission or interferometric techniques) rely on "looking" at a process to monitor its status. What was investigated here involved "listening" to the process. Using acoustic methods for process monitoring enhances the amount and sensitivity of data collection to facilitate process diagnostics and control. A silicon acoustic sensor was designed, fabricated, and implemented as a process monitor. Silicon acoustic sensors are favorable because of their utilization of integrated circuit and micromachining processing techniques; thus, enabling miniature devices with precise dimensions, batch fabrication of sensors, good reproducibility, and low costs. The fabricated sensor was used for in-situ monitoring of nickel-iron electrochemical deposition processes. During this process, changes occur in its plating bath as the alloy is being deposited. It is known that changes in the process medium affect the acoustic response. Thus, the sensor was implemented in an electroplating set-up and its response was observed during depositions. By mapping the sensor response received to the film thickness measured at certain times, a predictive model of the plated alloy thickness was derived as a function of sensor <b>output</b> and <b>plating</b> time.

5000|$|Hazeltine's {{innovation}} was to add {{a circuit}} to each radio frequency amplifier stage which fed back {{a small amount of}} energy from the <b>plate</b> (<b>output)</b> circuit to the grid (input) circuit with opposite phase to cancel ("neutralize") the feedback which was causing the oscillation. This effectively prevented the high-pitched squeals that had plagued early radio sets. A group of more than 20 companies known as the Independent Radio Manufacturers Association licensed the circuit from Hazeltine and manufactured [...] "Neutrodyne" [...] receivers throughout the 1920s. [...] At the time, RCA held a virtual monopoly over commercial radio receiver production due to its ownership of the rights to the Armstrong regenerative and superheterodyne circuits. The Neutrodyne ended this control, allowing competition. Compared to the technically superior superheterodyne the Neutrodyne was cheaper to build. As basically a TRF receiver, it was also considered easier for non-technical owners to use than the early superhets. After manufacture each tuned amplifier stage had to be neutralized, adjusted to cancel feedback; after this the set would not produce the parasitic oscillations which caused the objectionable noises. By 1927 some ten million of these receivers had been sold to consumers in North America.|$|R
