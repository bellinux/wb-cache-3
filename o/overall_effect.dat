5|$|Cells in zona reticularis of the {{adrenal glands}} produce male sex hormones, or androgens, the most {{important}} of which is DHEA. In general, these hormones do not have an <b>overall</b> <b>effect</b> in the male body, and are converted to more potent androgens such as testosterone and DHT or to estrogens (female sex hormones) in the gonads, acting in this way as a metabolic intermediate.|$|E
5|$|Disulfiram (Antabuse) {{prevents}} {{the elimination of}} acetaldehyde, a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself {{is the cause of}} many hangover symptoms from alcohol use. The <b>overall</b> <b>effect</b> is severe discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting uncomfortable hangover. This discourages an alcoholic from drinking in significant amounts while they take the medicine.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} advent of printing, the visual {{appearance}} of poetry often added meaning or depth. Acrostic poems conveyed meanings in the initial letters of lines or in letters at other specific places in a poem. In Arabic, Hebrew and Chinese poetry, the visual presentation of finely calligraphed poems has played an important part in the <b>overall</b> <b>effect</b> of many poems.|$|E

5|$|Management of {{the site}} {{requires}} moderate grazing {{during the summer and}} autumn to help maintain the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing grasses. Such grasses would allow a buildup of dead organic matter, which together with the increased growth, would reduce the growth of less vigorous species. The <b>overall</b> <b>effect</b> would be a reduction in species diversity, {{which was one of the}} reasons for the SSSI designation. Trampling can be of benefit because it breaks up accumulated dead organic matter.|$|E
5|$|People {{who live}} in large cities have {{a higher rate of}} COPD {{compared}} to people {{who live in}} rural areas. While urban air pollution is a contributing factor in exacerbations, its overall role as a cause of COPD is unclear. Areas with poor outdoor air quality, including that from exhaust gas, generally have higher rates of COPD. The <b>overall</b> <b>effect</b> in relation to smoking, however, is believed to be small.|$|E
5|$|The Moorland Indicators of Climate Change Initiative {{was set up}} in 2008 {{to collect}} data on climate change in the area. Students {{investigated}} the interaction between people and the moorlands, and their <b>overall</b> <b>effect</b> on climate change, to discover whether the moorlands are a net carbon sink or source, {{based on the fact that}} upland areas of Britain are a significant global carbon store in the form of peat. Human interaction in terms of direct erosion and fire as well as the effects of global warming are the major variables that they considered.|$|E

5|$|To {{help keep}} the {{building}} cool, Belluschi added bronze-colored translucent corrugated panel sunscreens to the facade. Supported by a bronze anodized aluminum lattice, the sunscreens are made of Rohm and Haas's principal product, Plexiglas. The use of sunscreens and dark colors gave the facade a textured pattern and <b>overall</b> <b>effect</b> of avoiding making the building appear oversized. Besides the sunscreens, Plexiglas {{was used in the}} board room, in a few of the artistic commissions and light fixtures by designer György Kepes.|$|E
5|$|In the Scottish Highlands, popular {{education}} was challenged by problems of distance and physical isolation, {{as well as}} teachers' and ministers' limited knowledge of Scottish Gaelic, the primary local language. Here the Kirk's parish schools were supplemented by those established from 1709 by the Scottish Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Its aim in the Highlands was to teach English language and end the attachment to Roman Catholicism associated with rebellious Jacobitism. Though the SSPCK schools eventually taught in Gaelic, the <b>overall</b> <b>effect</b> contributed to the erosion of Highland culture. Literacy rates were lower in the Highlands than in comparable Lowland rural society, and despite these efforts illiteracy remained prevalent into the nineteenth century.|$|E

5|$|The Rhodes Mk III EK-10 was a {{combination}} electric piano and synthesizer instrument, introduced in 1980 before CBS bought ARP Instruments in 1981. It used analog oscillators and filters alongside the existing electromechanical elements. The <b>overall</b> <b>effect</b> {{was that of a}} Rhodes piano and a synthesizer being played simultaneously. The instrument was unreliable with a problematic production, particularly when a shipment of 150 units to Japan caused interference with local television reception. Compared to the new polyphonic synthesizers being marketed at the same time, it was limited in scope and sound, and very few units were sold.|$|E
5|$|The choir, of five bays, {{was built}} between 1283 and 1315 {{to the design}} of Richard Lenginour, and is an early example of Decorated Gothic architecture. The piers have {{strongly}} modelled attached shafts, supporting deeply moulded arches. There is a triforium gallery with four cusped arches to each bay. The sexpartite vault, which is a 19th-century restoration, is supported by clusters of three shafts which spring from energetic figurative corbels. The <b>overall</b> <b>effect</b> is robust, and contrasts with the delicacy of the pinnacled choir stalls, the tracery of the windows and the rich decoration of the vault which was carried out by the ecclesiastical designers, Clayton and Bell. The choir stalls, dating from about 1380, are one of the glories of the cathedral.|$|E
5|$|The modern Regent Street is {{the result}} of this redevelopment. No {{original}} structures survive except south of Oxford Circus for some Nash-designed sewers. The current design {{is an example of the}} Beaux Arts approach to urban design: an assembly of separate buildings on a grand scale, designed to harmonise and produce an impressive <b>overall</b> <b>effect.</b> Strict rules governed the reconstruction. Each block had to be designed with a continuous unifying street façade and finished in Portland stone. The first redevelopment was Regent House, just south of Oxford Circus. The stylistic tone for the rebuilding was set by Sir Reginald Blomfield's Quadrant.|$|E

5|$|The English {{attacked}} the Temple Gate {{on the first}} day but were beaten off. Over the next three days the city gates were attacked simultaneously, without success. Before {{the end of the first}} week of the siege, reinforcements arrived to completely encircle the city walls and the outer ditch was breached using soil. On the eighth day (15 June) Despenser {{attacked the}} defences with artillery, firing on the Messines Gate and damaging it, but not enough to cause the city defences to be breached. Over the following days of the siege, sustained artillery attacks had little <b>overall</b> <b>effect</b> and the assaults of Despenser's troops were all beaten off. An attempt to drain the ditches seriously threatened the Yprois, but the attempt was unsuccessful and the besieged managed to communicate with the Duke of Burgundy through Louis le Mâle, who was able to raise a large French army to come to the aid of the city. On 8 August, after eight weeks of effort, Despenser abruptly decided to abandon the siege, leaving his allies to continue on their own.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{accepted}} coat colours, red and blue, though {{chocolate and}} cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled {{with or without}} black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration {{is the result of}} black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the <b>overall</b> <b>effect</b> depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.|$|E

To examine this possibility, the author conducts a sector-level analysis of the turmoil's impact. He concludes that, {{with the exception of the}} steel industry, imports from Asia do not compete directly with U. S. products. Accordingly, an appreciation in the dollar with respect to Asian currencies leads to consumption gains with little or no domestic pain. Financial crises - Asia; Industries; Asia...|$|R
