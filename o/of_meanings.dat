40|$|Are Germans {{suffering}} from a crisis <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> – as supposed by Chancellor Merkel in 2005 ? Following a short introduction to meaning research, and differentiations of the construct <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> in life, results of a representative study among 603 Germans are reported. Degrees of potential crises <b>of</b> <b>meaning,</b> meaningfulness, and relevance of 26 sources <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> were assessed by the Sources <b>of</b> <b>Meaning</b> Questionnaire (SoMe, German: LeBe; Schnell & Becker 2007). Data reveal a relatively low prevalence <b>of</b> crises <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> (4 %) – while not-randomly missing values could be {{partly responsible for the}} low frequency. One third of the sample appears as existentially indifferent: a newly discovered subpopulation of people who neither experience their lives as meaningful, nor suffer from a lack <b>of</b> <b>meaning.</b> For this group, relevance <b>of</b> sources <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> is altogether lower than for those who experience their lives as meaningful; partially, it is even lower than for individuals who suffer from a crisis <b>of</b> <b>meaning.</b> The existentially indifferent show very low values in self-knowledge, spirituality, explicit religiosity, and generativity. A multitude <b>of</b> sources <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> contributes to the Germans' experience of meaningfulness {{in the beginning of the}} 21 st century. Characteristic orientations are those towards morality, harmony, care, development, and community. Very low mean relevance is ascribed to explicit religiosity, followed by spirituality. Results show that the experience of meaningfulness increases with the degree of self-transcendence (depth) encompassed by characteristic sources <b>of</b> <b>meaning.</b> Meaningfulness also rises with the number of characteristic sources <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> (breadth), and it is more pronounced, the more diverse these sources <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> are (balance) ...|$|R

Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects.

Similarly figures of speech such as metaphor, simile and metonymy create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering <b>of</b> <b>meanings,</b> forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.|$|E

40|$|Incarceration {{has been}} {{described}} as a distressing experience, marked by important losses and accompanied by deep existential crises. Some prisoners "hit rock bottom" and are confronted with the fact that their life does not make sense anymore. Surprisingly, loss <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> among prisoners has not been studied in a quantitative way before. In this study, we explored the relationship between loss <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> inflicted by incarceration and distress. In a sample of 365 prisoners, univariate analyses and hierarchical multiple regression analyses confirmed that a loss <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> positively predicted distress in prison. Differences between prison regimes predicted distress, but had no influence on the loss <b>of</b> <b>meaning.</b> Unsentenced incarceration, in contrast, did not have a direct relationship to distress, but amplified the effect <b>of</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> on distress.

5|$|During the Eastern Han, I Ching {{interpretation}} {{divided into}} two schools, originating {{in a dispute over}} minor differences between different editions of the received text. The first school, known as New Text criticism, was more egalitarian and eclectic, and sought to find symbolic and numerological parallels between the natural world and the hexagrams.

The other school, Old Text criticism, was more scholarly and hierarchical, and focused on the moral content of the text, providing the basis for the School <b>of</b> <b>Meanings</b> and Principles. The New Text scholars distributed alternate versions of the text and freely integrated non-canonical commentaries into their work, as well as propagating alternate systems of divination such as the Taixuanjing.

The rapid development of science and technology in the Western world, for example, has had an impact on the development of the Indonesian language. Multilingual society, such as the Indonesian people, sooner or later, will get acquainted with other languages that are definitely not the original language. This happens also in the development of our national language, Indonesian language, which at any time continues to grow. This development can be influenced by various factors of migration, housing, education, and others. It may affect the expansion of vocabulary or the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> vocabulary in the form of expansion or narrowing <b>of</b> the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the word division. In addition to the expansion <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> and a narrowing <b>of</b> <b>meaning,</b> the meaning changes are considered by Indonesian as the efforts to revive the archaic lexical items with the same meaning, new significance with the expansion <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> or new meaning.
