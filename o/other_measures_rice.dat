30|$|A second {{concern in}} the debate is that {{managers}} deliberately use DVAs to improve earnings and <b>other</b> performance <b>measures.</b> Bob <b>Rice,</b> the founder of Tangent Capital Partners LLC, argues {{in an interview that}} the FASB introduced DVAs “because frankly the banks and their accountants were looking for ways to find profits” (Rice 2012). Analyst Meredith A. Whitney said in 2009 that banks use DVAs as a tool for a “great whitewash” to create the impression that banks are stabilizing after the financial crisis (Dash 2009). Other critics that share this point of view see DVAs as “accounting tactics—gimmicks” (Dash 2009), “accounting tricks”, or even a “shameful scam” that banks deploy “to boost their profits” (Carver 2012 a). Still other voices in the DVA debate contradict this view. For example, Joyce Frost, a co-founder of Riverside Risk Advisors LLC, states that DVAs are “not something banks decided to use to boost their earnings” (Burne 2011). Another expert argues that “shareholders cannot push for more of a mark-to-market world, but then cherry-pick when they want to include the mark-to-market” (Burne 2011).|$|R

40|$|Rice {{crop height}} is an {{important}} agronomic trait linked to plant type and yield potential. This research developed an automatic image processing technique to detect rice crop height based on images taken by a digital camera attached to a field server. The camera acquires rice paddy images daily at a consistent time of day. The images include the rice plants and a marker bar used to provide a height reference. The rice crop height can be indirectly measured from the images by measuring {{the height of the}} marker bar compared to the height of the initial marker bar. Four digital image processing steps are employed to automatically <b>measure</b> the <b>rice</b> crop height: band selection, filtering, thresholding, and height measurement. Band selection is used to remove redundant features. Filtering extracts significant features of the marker bar. The thresholding method is applied to separate objects and boundaries of the marker bar versus other areas. The marker bar is detected and compared with the initial marker bar to <b>measure</b> the <b>rice</b> crop height. Our experiment used a field server with a digital camera to continuously monitor a rice field located in Suphanburi Province, Thailand. The experimental results show that the proposed method <b>measures</b> <b>rice</b> crop height effectively, with no human intervention required...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Equilibrium {{moisture}} content (EMC) /equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) studies pertaining to rice and rice products were reviewed. Methods of determining rice and rice component EMC/ERH data varied, using procedures involving static and dynamic equilibration methods, {{as well as}} direct gravimetric methods and indirect ERH‐measurement methods. Methods for <b>measuring</b> <b>rice</b> and rice component {{moisture content}}s also varied. The Modified Henderson and Modified Chung‐Pfost equations were most frequently recommended for predicting the sorption behavior of rice. Among rough rice components, for any given temperature and relative humidity, the EMC of milled and brown rice were consistently the greatest, generally followed by rough rice, bran, and hull. The hysteresis effect was apparent in rice. The magnitude of hysteresis decreased with repeated cycles of drying and rewetting and with increasing temperature. EMC/ERH relationships were affected by rice cultivar, but harvest location {{was not a significant}} factor. As such, in order to be most accurate, EMC/ERH equations for each rice cultivar need to be determined...|$|R

40|$|International audienceModern {{breeding}} {{technologies are}} capable of producing hundreds of new varieties daily, so fast, simple and effective methods for screening valuable candidate plant materials are urgently needed. Final yield is a significant agricultural trait in rice breeding. In the screening and evaluation of the <b>rice</b> varieties, <b>measuring</b> and evaluating <b>rice</b> yield is essential. Conventional means of <b>measuring</b> <b>rice</b> yield mainly depend on manual determination, which is tedious, labor-intensive, subjective and error-prone, especially when large-scale plants were to be investigated. This paper presented an in vivo, automatic and high-throughput method to estimate the yield of individual pot-grown rice plant using multi-angle RGB imaging and image analysis. In this work, we demonstrated a new idea of estimating rice yield from projected panicle area, projected area of leaf and stem and fractal dimension. 5 -fold cross validation showed that the predictive error was 7. 45 %. The constructed model achieved promising results on rice plants grown both in-door and out-door.
