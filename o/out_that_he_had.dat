5|$|In August 2015, Darabont {{requested}} to amend his original complaint that AMC further reduced his profits from Season 2 as his firing mid-season {{meant he was}} not fully vested in the season, allowing AMC to reduce the profits paid him. Darabont's amended request points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> written and produced all the episodes in that season already and was entitled to the proper profit share. The judge granted this amendment in February 2016, partially influenced by concerns raised in Darabont's deposition.|$|E

5|$|In the film, Aksel Winther, who {{is based}} on Vilhelm Leifer, {{is the one who}} gives Flammen and Citron orders to kill. Birkelund pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> already moved to Sweden by the time of their assassinations, while Madsen stated he was sure Leifer gave orders before leaving the country. Also, they met Frode Jacobsen in a meeting in Sweden, and he is said to have given orders from there. Birkelund {{rejected}} the idea of Jacobsen giving orders, but Madsen said the meetings were created by him to show that the resistance movements of that time had approaches different from those of their present-day counterparts.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of Olivier Messiaen on Takemitsu was already apparent {{in some of}} Takemitsu's earliest published works. By the time he composed Lento in Due Movimenti, (1950), Takemitsu had already come into possession of a copy of Messiaen's 8 Préludes (through Toshi Ichiyanagi), and the {{influence of}} Messiaen is clearly visible in the work, in the use of modes, the suspension of regular metre, and sensitivity to timbre. Throughout his career Takemitsu often made use of modes from which he derived his musical material, both melodic and harmonic among which Messiaen's modes of limited transposition to appear with some frequency. In particular, the use of the octatonic, (modeII, or the 8–28 collection), and modeVI (8–25) is particularly common. However, Takemitsu pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> used the octatonic collection in his music before ever coming across it in Messiaen's music.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} {{reaction}} {{from most of}} the military commanders. Phát's rebels set up their command post in the Saigon home of General Dương Ngọc Lắm, a Diệm loyalist who had been removed from his post as Mayor of Saigon by Khánh. In contrast to Phát's serene demeanour, his incoming troops prompted worshippers at the Roman Catholic cathedral attending mass to flee in panic. The Buddhists, however, made no overt reaction to a coup that would dent their rights. Air Force commander Kỳ had promised two weeks earlier to use his planes against any coup attempt, but there was no reaction early in the morning. Đức mistakenly thought Kỳ and his subordinates would join the coup, but later realized that he was mistaken. After he found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been tricked into thinking that the plotters had great strength, he defected. Several U.S. advisers were chased away by rebel officers who did not want interference in the coup. They thought the Americans would not approve of their actions, as both U.S. Ambassador Maxwell Taylor and President Lyndon Johnson had made optimistic comments about South Vietnam recently.|$|E

5|$|Whilst {{en route}} to the Albino's hideout, the four plan their attack. Kang {{suggests}} an aggressive frontal assault, which the Klingons agree to. Jadzia confronts him afterwards and finds <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> already been in contact with the Albino who offered him a glorious death at the hands of forty of his best men, and Kang accepted as he believes the Albino's defences are impenetrable. Dax creates an alternative plan to disable all energy weapons in the Albino's base, requiring them to use hand-to-hand combat only. Kang agrees to the new plan. They transport to the surface and find that the Albino attempted to booby trap the main gate to kill Kang and the others before a fight started. The four move through the compound and confront the Albino in his chambers. During the fight, Koloth is killed and Kang is mortally wounded. Jadzia disarms the Albino and allows Kang to kill him, before he dies himself. Kor and Jadzia leave the compound as the Klingon sings a song to his fallen comrades.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1932–33 series, several authors, {{including}} {{many of the}} players involved, released books expressing various points of view about bodyline. Many {{argued that it was}} a scourge on cricket and must be stamped out, while some did not see what all the fuss was about. The series has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history, and voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities. The MCC asked Harold Larwood to sign an apology to them for his bowling in Australia, making his selection for England again conditional upon it. Larwood was furious at the notion, pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been following orders from his upper-class captain, and that was where any blame should lie. Larwood refused, never played for England again, and became vilified in his own country. Douglas Jardine always defended his tactics and in the book he wrote about the tour, In Quest of the Ashes, described allegations that the England bowlers directed their attack with the intention of causing physical harm as stupid and patently untruthful. The immediate effect of the law change which banned bodyline in 1935 was to make commentators and spectators sensitive to the use of short-pitched bowling; bouncers became exceedingly rare and bowlers who delivered them were practically ostracised. This attitude ended after the Second World War, and among the first teams to make extensive use of short-pitched bowling was the Australian team captained by Bradman between 1946 and 1948. Other teams soon followed.|$|E

25|$|Spock's {{supporters}} {{countered that}} these criticisms betrayed an ignorance of what Spock had actually written, and/or a political bias against Spock's left-wing political activities. Spock himself, in his autobiography, pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never advocated permissiveness; also, that the attacks and {{claims that he}} had ruined American youth only arose after his public opposition to the Vietnam war. He regarded these claims as ad hominem attacks, whose political motivation and nature were clear.|$|E

It turned <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> surgically inserted a Penrose drain into his arm and filled it with foreign blood and anticoagulants.|$|E
25|$|To my {{knowledge}} {{there is only}} one top-flight professional gay footballer who came out – Justin Fashanu. He ended up committing suicide.

No, but if you go on the terraces and hear the way fans are, and also, that kind of general attitude that goes with football, it's almost like going back to the dark ages.|$|E
