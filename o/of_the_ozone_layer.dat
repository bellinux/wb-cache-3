5|$|The {{chlorine}} oxides are well-studied {{in spite of}} their instability (all of them are endothermic compounds). They are important because they are produced when chlorofluorocarbons undergo photolysis in the upper atmosphere and cause the destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer.</b> None of them can be made from directly reacting the elements.|$|E
5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's biosphere.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} organisms, {{increasing}} ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion {{and other factors}} may harm the DNA of amphibians, particularly their eggs. The amount of damage depends upon the life stage, the species type and other environmental parameters. Salamanders and frogs that produce less photolyase, an enzyme that counteracts DNA damage from UVB, {{are more susceptible to}} the effects of loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer.</b> Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 {{there were}} {{believed}} to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle. Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including habitat destruction and modification, over-exploitation, pollution, introduced species, climate change, endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> (ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and diseases like chytridiomycosis. However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon {{is known as the}} greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.|$|E

The Vienna Convention for the Protection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ozone</b> <b>Layer</b> did not cover bromofluoroalkanes as it was thought, at the time, that emergency discharge of extinguishing systems was too small in volume to produce a significant impact, and too important to human safety for restriction.|$|E

25|$|Models and {{observations}} (see figure above, middle) show that greenhouse gas results in warming {{of the lower}} atmosphere at the surface (called the troposphere) but cooling of the upper atmosphere (called the stratosphere). Depletion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> by chemical refrigerants has also resulted in a cooling effect in the stratosphere. If the sun was responsible for observed warming, warming of the troposphere at the surface and warming {{at the top of}} the stratosphere would be expected as increase solar activity would replenish ozone and oxides of nitrogen. The stratosphere has a reverse temperature gradient than the troposphere so as the temperature of the troposphere cools with altitude, the stratosphere rises with altitude. Hadley cells are the mechanism by which equatorial generated ozone in the tropics (highest area of UV irradiance in the stratosphere) is moved poleward. Global climate models suggest that climate change may widen the Hadley cells and push the jetstream northward thereby expanding the tropics region and resulting in warmer, dryer conditions in those areas overall.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Government's {{attitude}} {{began to}} change again in 1983, when William Ruckelshaus replaced Anne M. Burford as Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Under Ruckelshaus and his successor, Lee Thomas, the EPA pushed for an international approach to halocarbon regulations. In 1985 20 nations, including {{most of the major}} CFC producers, signed the Vienna Convention for the Protection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ozone</b> <b>Layer,</b> which established a framework for negotiating international regulations on ozone-depleting substances. That same year, the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole was announced, causing a revival in public attention to the issue. In 1987, representatives from 43 nations signed the Montreal Protocol. Meanwhile, the halocarbon industry shifted its position and started supporting a protocol to limit CFC production. However, this shift was uneven with DuPont acting more quickly than their European counterparts. DuPont may have feared court action related to increased skin cancer especially as the EPA had published a study in 1986 claiming that an additional 40 million cases and 800,000 cancer deaths were to be expected in the U.S. in the next 88 years. The EU shifted its position as well after Germany gave up its defence of the CFC industry and started supporting moves towards regulation. Government and industry in France and the UK tried to defend their CFC producing industries even after the Montreal Protocol had been signed.|$|E
