40|$|Traffic related {{trauma is}} {{the most common cause of}} {{fatality}} and severe injury to children in developed countries. The majority of these fatalities and injuries are caused by frontal and side impacts. Researchers agree that the head {{is the most}} important body region to protect for all ages of children, while the thorax is equally important for older children. Injury epidemiology has shown that special attention is needed for the 3 -year-olds in boosters and the 12 -year-olds in seat belts only. The aim of this thesis is to develop mathematical frontal and side impact models and to use them to investigate and define the beneficial characteristics of restraint systems and other crash-related car parameters. It must be emphasized that children are better protected in rear-facing child restraints; they should remain rear-facing for as long as possible. Most children have outgrown the large rear-facing restraints by the age of about 4 years. This work concentrates on injury mitigation for those who have transited to forward-facing restraints. Models for two load cases were developed and validated. One of them was a frontal impact type, and the other was a near-side impact type. The frontal model was used both for a parameter study, to define beneficial restraint system characteristics for 3 -year-olds, and for reconstructing three crashes in order to evaluate the head kinematics of the occupant model. The characteristics of the side impact load case were defined by analyzing real life crashes involving child occupants. The near-side impact model was used for a parameter study to define beneficial restraint system characteristics for 3 - and 12 -year-olds. It was also used to evaluate and propose improvements to the restraint systems within a range of common sitting positions for 12 -year-olds. The validations carried out here showed that the models developed were suitable tools for conducting comparative studies of injury mitigation systems in both frontal and near-side impacts. The parameter studies showed that several of the restraint systems for adults also reduced the values measured by the child model. In the near-side impact, a curtain airbag, a thorax-pelvis airbag and a seat belt with a pretensioner reduced the head and chest injury measures of the two occupant models. To help mitigate injuries resulting from a frontal impact, the upper belt anchor point should be positioned so that the belt is routed near mid-shoulder (slightly toward the neck) and encloses the shoulder (tight fit). The lap belt anchor points should be positioned to make the lap belt angle as horizontal as possible without inducing submarining. Seat belts with pretensioners and load limiters also reduced the head injury measures for the 3 -year-old occupant model. In side impacts, the results of the evaluation of common sitting positions suggested that extensive <b>outboard,</b> <b>inboard</b> and forward positions should be discouraged, while the restraint systems should be adapted to function with slight inboard, outboard and forward positions. This can be achieved with side supports integrated in the seat back, pre-impact (pre-brake) trigged seat belts, high performance full cell coverage curtain airbags, and/or thorax-pelvis airbags with an extended cover area. These findings are significant contributions to the continuous work of mitigating traffic accident induced injuries and fatalities to children...|$|E
2500|$|Boat rudders may {{be either}} <b>outboard</b> or <b>inboard.</b> <b>Outboard</b> rudders are {{hung on the}} stern or transom. Inboard rudders are hung from a keel or skeg and are thus fully {{submerged}} beneath the hull, connected to the steering mechanism by a rudder post which comes up through the hull to deck level, often into a cockpit. [...] Inboard keel hung rudders (which are {{a continuation of the}} aft trailing edge of the full keel) are traditionally deemed the most damage resistant rudders for off shore sailing. [...] Better performance with faster handling characteristics can be provided by skeg hung rudders on boats with smaller fin keels.|$|R

50|$|For 1975, the PRV {{engine was}} not {{available}} for the American market so the 164 was produced for one more year for America and Japan only.

The interior allowed up to 189 passengers, {{the same as the}} -120 and -220 series, but improved two-class capacity due to an 80-in fuselage stretch ahead of the wing (from 138 ft to 145 ft [...] ), with extensions to the fin and horizontal stabilizer extending the aircraft's length further. The longer wing carried more fuel, increasing range by 1600 mi and allowing the aircraft to operate as true transoceanic aircraft. The wing modifications included <b>outboard</b> and <b>inboard</b> inserts, as well as a kink in the trailing edge to add area inboard. Takeoff weight was increased to 302000 lb initially and to 312000 lb with the higher-rated JT4As and center section tanks.

40|$|A {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} on a flapped semi-span model to investigate the concept and viability of near-wake vortex management by means of boundary layer separation control. Passive control was achieved using a simple fairing and active control was achieved via zero mass-flux blowing slots. Vortex sheet strength, estimated by integrating surface pressures, was used to predict vortex characteristics based on inviscid rollup relations and vortices trailing the flaps were mapped using a seven-hole probe. Separation control {{was found to have}} a marked effect on vortex location, strength, tangential velocity, axial velocity and size over a wide range of angles of attack and control conditions. In general, the vortex trends were well predicted by the inviscid rollup relations. Manipulation of the separated flow near the flap edges exerted significant control over either <b>outboard</b> or <b>inboard</b> edge vortices while producing small lift and moment excursions. Unsteady surface pressures indicated that dynamic separation and attachment control can be exploited to perturb vortices at wavelengths shorter than a typical wingspan. In summary, separation control has the potential for application to time-independent or time-dependent wake alleviation schemes, where the latter can be deployed to minimize adverse effects on ride-quality and dynamic structural loading...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{proposes a}} multi-body dynamic {{simulation}} to numerically evaluate the generated axial force(G. A. F) and plunging resistant force(P. R. F) practically {{related to the}} shudder and idling vibration of an automobile. A numerical analysis of two plunging types of CV joints, tripod joint(TJ) and very low axial tripod joint(VTJ), is conducted using the commercial program DAFUL. User-defined subroutines of a friction model illustrating the contacted parts of the <b>outboard</b> and <b>inboard</b> joint are subsequently developed to overcome the numerical instability and improve the solution performance. The Coulomb friction effect is applied to describe the contact models of the lubricated parts in the rolling and sliding mechanisms. The numerical results, {{in accordance with the}} joint articulation angle variation, are validated with experimentation. The offset between spider and tulip housing is demonstrated to be the critical role in producing the 3 rd order component of the axial force that potentially causes the noise and vibration in vehicle. The VTJ shows an excellent behavior for the shudder when compared with TJ. In addition, a flexible nonlinear contact analysis coupled with rigid multi-body dynamics is also performed to show the dynamic strength characteristics of the rollers, housing, and spider...|$|R
