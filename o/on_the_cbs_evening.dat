40|$|Block {{copolymers}} {{that combine}} a side-group liquid crystalline polymer (SGLCP) block and a pH-responsivehydrophilic block, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), are shown to confer pH-dependent anchoring {{of the director}} orientation at the aqueous/LC interface. The SGLCP block, poly(4 -cyanobiphenyl- 4 -oxyundecylacrylate), was chosen based {{on its ability to}} influence the director field of <b>the</b> 5 <b>CB</b> (4 -cyano- 4 '-pentylbiphenyl). At low pH the PAA block collapses and the inherent, planar alignment tendency of 5 CB at a water interface prevails. As pH increases, the polyelectrolyte block becomes increasingly charged and expands, producing a change to homeotropic anchoring. The change in anchoring occurs as quickly as the buffer can be changed (within 2 s) and is reversible, with a response that is repeatable over as many cycles as were tested (approximately 20 cycles). The polymer-mediated anchoring persists for 6 days, indicating that the SGLCP block secures <b>the</b> self-assembled layer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 5 <b>CB,</b> <b>even</b> under conditions that cause repulsive interactions among the PAA blocks. Thus, SGLCP blocks can translate conformational changes of a responsive hydrophilic block into rapid, reversible changes in the director fiel...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{describe}} and compare scoring patterns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CB 2 ̆ 6 M) in healthy men and women between 30 and 59 years of age. Methods: Following criterion testing on 5 individuals, 90 healthy volunteers who met the inclusion criteria and consented to participate in the study were tested <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 ̆ 6 M. The subjects were recruited through quota sampling in three age categories: 30 to 39 years, 40 to 49 years, and 50 to 59 years, with 15 men and 15 women in each age category. The groups were not matched for any anthropometric variables. Results: Women within the age category of 50 to 59 years had significantly lower scores <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 ̆ 6 M compared with all other age and gender categories. Conclusions: The results from this study indicate that although <b>the</b> items <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 ̆ 6 M were appropriate for the 30 - to 59 -year age categories, some items still posed a challenge to healthy participants because most were unable to score full points <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 ̆ 6 M. The normative data from the present study could help clinicians put <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 ̆ 6 M scores of middle-aged patients into context.

25|$|North Dakota was {{far away}} from the centers of the hippie {{movement}} on the coasts of the United States, but this did not mean that the local students did not {{know what was going on}} with their peers at schools such as UC-Berkeley. The combination of tension between the students and the established powers, and the local and state governments' lack of experience in dealing with large gatherings of angry and drunk protesters led to the riot that would put Zap, North Dakota across the headlines of the U.S. newspapers and make it the lead story <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CBS</b> <b>Evening</b> News with Walter Cronkite.

He was told that if he had done anything other than what he did, NBC would have been at the mercy of Timex and Cline would have been fired.

500|$|In the United Kingdom, the Beatles had {{experienced}} popularity {{since the start}} of 1963. But in the United States, Capitol Records, owned by the band's record company EMI, had for most of the year declined to issue any of the singles. The phenomenon of Beatlemania in the UK was regarded with amusement by the U.S. press, once it made any comment. When newspaper and magazine articles did begin to appear towards the end of 1963, they cited the English stereotype of eccentricity, reporting that the UK had developed an interest in something that had come and gone a long time ago in the United States: rock and roll. Headlines included [...] "The New Madness" [...] and [...] "Beatle Bug Bites Britain", and writers employed word-play linking [...] "beetle" [...] with the [...] "infestation" [...] afflicting the UK. In late 1963, Capitol Records agreed to release the single [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] with a large accompanying promotional campaign, due to Ed Sullivan's agreement to headline the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show. The Beatles' American television debut was on 18 November 1963 on The Huntley-Brinkley Report, with a four-minute long piece by Edwin Newman. On 22 November 1963, the CBS Morning News ran a five-minute feature on Beatlemania in the UK which heavily featured their then current UK hit [...] "She Loves You". The evening's scheduled repeat was cancelled following the assassination of JohnF. Kennedy the same day.

40|$|In this study, {{the support}} vector machine (SVM) is applied as a {{learning}} machine for the secondary structure prediction. As an encoding scheme for training the SVM, position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) is adopted. To improve the prediction accuracy, three optimization processes such as encoding scheme, sliding window size and parameter optimization are performed. For the multi-class classification, the results of three one-versus-one binary classifiers (H/E, E/C and C/H) are combined using our new tertiary classifier called SVM_Represent. By applying this new tertiary classifier, the Q 3 prediction accuracy reaches 89. 6 % <b>on</b> <b>the</b> RS 126 dataset and 90. 1 % <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 513 dataset.

For a given protein sequence, PSI-BLAST is used to generate a profile that defines patterns for amino acid residues and their local sequence environments. By applying the PSI-BLAST to protein sequences with known secondary structures, we construct pattern databases.
