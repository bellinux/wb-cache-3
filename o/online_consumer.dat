40|$|Background: Population of <b>online</b> <b>consumers</b> {{increases}} rapidly, but {{the decision-making}} styles of <b>online</b> <b>consumers</b> and psychiatric denominators {{such as the}} personality correlates remain unclear. Subjects and methods: In 196 traditional, and 196 age-, education- and gender-matched <b>online</b> <b>consumers,</b> we have tested the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ) and the Consumer Style Inventory (CSI). Results: After exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, we have defined a five-factor model CSI with 24 items. <b>Online</b> <b>consumers</b> scored lower on ZKPQ Neuroticism-Anxiety and higher on Aggression-Hostility than traditional ones did, and scored higher on CSI Novelty-fashion consciousness and Brand consciousness, and lower on Time consciousness than the traditional consumers did. ZKPQ Neuroticism-Anxiety {{was positively correlated with}} CSI Confused by overchoice in both groups, Sociability was positively correlated with Novelty-fashion consciousness and negatively with Time consciousness in traditional group, and Impulsive Sensation Seeking was positively correlated with Novelty-fashion consciousness and Time consciousness in online group. Conclusions: Our study suggests that, regarding the decision-making styles, <b>online</b> <b>consumers</b> display curiosity that lacks security and need other ways to improve their social lives. It also calls further designs to address the contributions of other psychiatric features to the particular decision-making styles in <b>online</b> <b>consumers...</b>|$|R

This study examines the relationship between online merchants and <b>online</b> <b>consumers</b> focusing on how information is passed between the two. With consumers able to search and view dozens of stores in the time it used to take for many of them to drive to one, why are consumers not able to find the best price for the good they hope to buy? By examining past literature on information theory and consumer behavior, combined with considering a 3 x 3 sample of <b>online</b> <b>consumers</b> actually finding items in an online environment, this study will serve as a base for further research on what drives consumer interaction with electronic markets.

Yet, for firms that predominantly sell offline, existing research provides little guidance on online advertising decisions. In this study, the authors analyze the impact of banner advertising on consumers 2 ̆ 7 online and offline behavior across multiple distinct campaigns for one focal firm, which predominantly sells through the offline channel. Results suggest that banner and TV advertising increase website visit incidence for consumers who had not visited the focal firm 2 ̆ 7 s website in the previous four weeks (non-recent <b>online</b> <b>consumers).</b> For these consumers, banner and TV advertisements indirectly increase offline sales through website visits. For consumers who have visited the firm 2 ̆ 7 s website in the previous four weeks (recent <b>online</b> <b>consumers),</b> the authors find evidence for a cross-campaign, brand-building effect of banner advertising, and TV ads also directly affect offline purchases. Overall, the findings indicate that for firms which predominantly (or even exclusively) sell offline, banner advertising is most suitable to generate awareness for a firm 2 ̆ 7 s new products among non-recent <b>online</b> <b>consumers,</b> and to build their brand(s) among recent <b>online</b> <b>consumers...</b>|$|R

In addressing this question, in present study, we propose and empirically test a framework for explaining the relationships between offline channel attributes and <b>online</b> <b>consumers</b> 2 ̆ 7 intentions to shop in both channels. The results reveal that while cognitive offline channel attributes have a direct and positive impact on <b>online</b> <b>consumers</b> 2 ̆ 7 intentions to shop offline, relational offline channel attributes contribute to consumers 2 ̆ 7 patronage intentions online, given the contextual intervention.
