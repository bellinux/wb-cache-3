50|$|The Ahrens-Fox Fire Engine Company is an Ohio-based {{fire truck}} manufacturer. The company {{was founded in}} 1910 by John P Ahrens and Charles H Fox and built its first {{motorized}} fire engine in 1911. By {{the end of the}} following year production of horse-drawn fire apparatus ceased completely. Since then, over 1500 pieces of fire apparatus were built until 1977. Ahrens-Fox fire engines were recognizable by the chromed sphere above the pump that held air and smoothed the <b>outgoing</b> <b>pressure</b> fluctuations from the piston pump.|$|E
50|$|The {{wave motion}} {{through the air}} masses should not be {{confused}} with the separate motions of the masses themselves. At the start of deflagration, the pressure wave immediately moves through both air masses, while the gas expansion (due to combustion heat) is just beginning in the combustion zone. The intake air mass will be rapidly accelerated outward behind the pressure wave, because its mass is relatively small. The tailpipe air mass will follow the <b>outgoing</b> <b>pressure</b> wave much more slowly. Also, the eventual flow reversal will take place much sooner in the intake, due to its smaller air mass. The timing of the wave motions is determined basically by the lengths of the intake and main tube of the engine; the timing of mass motions is determined mostly by the volumes and exact shapes of these sections. Both are affected by local gas temperatures.|$|E

40|$|Electron diffraction, imaging, {{and energy}} loss provide {{evidence}} for unlayered graphene sheets {{in the core of}} certain interstellar graphite onions (from the meteorite Murchison) whose isotopes indicate formation in the atmosphere of late-stage asymptotic giant branch stars (like those which nucleo-synthesized much of the earth's carbon). The data are compared to structural models loosely associated with atom-by-atom, molecule-by-molecule, and dendritic-droplet solidification processes. In this context the observed density, diffraction peak-shapes, and edge-on sheet patterns, along with theoretical limits on time for growth in the presence of <b>outgoing</b> radiation <b>pressure,</b> suggest nucleation of hexagonal sheets from pentagons, perhaps from a supercooled melt. These results warrant a closer examination of specimen structure, the energetics of unlayered graphene nucleation, and processes such as jets in late star atmospheres.

40|$|Mass {{accretion}} onto {{black holes}} releases {{energy in the}} form of radiation and outflows. Although the radiative flux cannot substantially exceed the Eddington limit, at which the <b>outgoing</b> radiation <b>pressure</b> impedes the inflow of matter, it remains unclear whether the kinetic energy flux is bounded by this same limit. Here, we present the detection of a radio-optical structure, powered by outflows from a non-nuclear black hole. Its accretion disk properties indicate that this black hole is less than 100 solar masses. The optical-infrared line emission implies an average kinetic power of 3 × 1040 erg second– 1, higher than the Eddington luminosity of the black hole. These results demonstrate kinetic power exceeding the Eddington limit over a sustained period, which implies greater ability to influence the evolution of the black hole’s environment. Foran accreting black hole (BH) of massM,the Eddington luminosity [LEdd ≈ 1. 3 × 1038 (M/M⊙) erg s– 1; where M ⊙ is solar mass] is the maximum photon power achievable for spherically symmetric, radiatively efficient ac-cretion, and the Eddington accretion rate is the corresponding mass accretion rate. However, BHs can also release energy throughmechanical chan...|$|R
50|$|In a multi-arm spiral, {{outgoing}} gas meeting an arm would outweigh ingoing {{gas in the}} arm. This {{would tend}} to remove gas from the arm. In a two armed spiral, the gas in the arm has greater mass. Thus, a two-armed gaseous spiral can be stable, whereas multiarmed gaseous spirals cannot. <b>Outgoing</b> gas applies <b>pressure</b> to {{the trailing edge of}} a spiral arm with an inverse proportionality to radius. If one gaseous arm advances compared to the bisymmetric position, the pressure due to gas from the other arm will be reduced. At the same time, pressure on the retarded arm due to outgoing gas from the advanced arm will be increased. Thus gas motions preserve the symmetry of two-armed spirals.|$|R
40|$|Instabilities {{associated}} with fluid handling and operation in liquid rocket propulsion systems and test facilities usually manifest themselves as structural vibrations or {{some form of}} structural damage. While {{the source of the}} instability {{is directly related to the}} performance of a component such as a turbopump, valve or a flow control element, the associated pressure fluctuations as they propagate through the system have the potential to amplify and resonate with natural modes of the structural elements and components of the system. In this paper, the authors have developed an innovative multi-level approach that involves analysis at the component and systems level. The primary source of the unsteadiness is modeled with a high-fidelity hybrid RANS/LES based CFD methodology that has been previously used to study instabilities in feed systems. This high fidelity approach is used to quantify the instability and understand the physics {{associated with}} the instability. System response to the driving instability is determined through a transfer matrix approach wherein the incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>pressure</b> and velocity fluctuations are related through a transfer (or transmission) matrix. The coefficients of the transfer matrix for each component (i. e. valve, pipe, orifice etc.) are individually derived from the flow physics associated with the component. A demonstration case representing a test loop/test facility comprised of a network of elements is constructed with the transfer matrix approach and the amplification of modes analyzed as the instability propagates through the test loop...|$|E
40|$|At typical landing speeds, the {{cylindrical}} cavity ow {{that develops}} past an aircraft fuel vent displays tonal convective streamwise instabilities. The higher frequency {{range of the}} noise radiated by such a cavity compared to ap noise is perceived by a ground observer as louder with respect to what its amplitude in decibel would suggest, due to the dB(A) weighting. A three-dimensional time-dependent numerical model of a cylindrical cavity ow is obtained using an in-house three-dimensional compressible laminar solver. This simulation predicts the ow instability and gives a preliminary understanding of the inuence of the inow momentum thickness (µ) on the ow unsteadiness. Time-dependent cavity ow models are obtained at two different Reynolds numbers (Reµ) based on the inow momentum thickness, Reµ = 8850 and Reµ = 10750, for two diameter to depth ratios (L/D), 0. 71 and 2. 5. The near-eld sound pressure level (SPL), the pressure coefcient Cp, and the shear layer spanning the cavity are analyzed. The numerical experiments suggest that the deep cavity {{is characterized by a}} self-sustained instability and that the shallow cavity is characterized by a steady ow recirculation. The near-eld SPL was compared with past Euler predictions to study the inuence of the shear layer growth on the radiating pressure eld.

40|$|The {{effect of}} liquid {{compressibility}} on {{the dynamics of}} a single, spherical cavitating bubble is studied. While {{it is known that}} compressibility damps the amplitude of bubble rebounds, the extent to which this effect is accurately captured by weakly compressible versions of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation is unclear. To clarify this issue, partial differential equations governing conservation of mass, momentum, and energy are numerically solved both inside the bubble and in the surrounding compressible liquid. Radiated pressure waves originating at the unsteady bubble interface are directly captured. Results obtained with Rayleigh-Plesset type equations accounting for compressibility effects, proposed by Keller and Miksis [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 68, 628 - 633 (1980) ], Gilmore, and Tomita and Shima [Bull. JSME 20, 1453 - 1460 (1977) ], are compared with those resulting from the full model. For strong collapses, the solution of the latter reveals that {{an important part of the}} energy concentrated during the collapse is used to generate an <b>outgoing</b> <b>pressure</b> wave. For the examples considered in this research, peak pressures are larger than those predicted by Rayleigh-Plesset type equations, whereas the amplitudes of the rebounds are smaller.

5000|$|While the {{positive}} pressure isolator is most common, [...] "negative" [...] pressure devices also exist for very large industrial operations that handle toxic products. A simpler {{and more effective}} option for most toxicological containment applications {{is the use of}} [...] "closed isolator" [...] design (this positive pressure isolator is the most appropriate containment option unless a company is processing thousands of units per minute). When a negative isolator js used, its design is quite intricate as it must fulfill two objectives: protect workers outside of the isolator, and assure sterility of sterile drugs inside the isolator. As such, the term [...] "negative pressure" [...] isolator is somewhat of a misnomer, as contaminated ("polluted") room air must not be pulled into the main workstation isolator in a sterile operation. Thus, the actual workstation isolator is always maintained under substantial positive pressure. The [...] "negative" [...] pressure isolator does however include a separate buffer zone (an extra isolator compartment) that is designed to exhaust both incoming room air and <b>outgoing</b> positive <b>pressure</b> air from the main workstation. The main workstation isolator, in which the sterile product is exposed, is therefore protected from contaminated air and the toxic product is exhausted via the buffer zone before it reaches operators working outside of the isolation.|$|R
40|$|Structural grids (grid metastructures) {{supporting}} discrete pressure waves {{similar to}} the pressure waves in continuous media are considered. The grids consist of links capable of transmitting longitudinal pressure waves and nodes providing equal pressures {{on the ends of}} <b>outgoing</b> links. The <b>pressures</b> in the nodes are governed by finite-difference equations approximating, under certain conditions, the wave equation in free space. It is shown that the pressures in the nodes are determined by the acoustic velocities and impedances of links rather than by the coordinates of the nodes and the link lengths. Therefore, a grid approximating pressure waves in a region of uniform homogeneous space can be replaced by an equivalent “deformed” grid with other spatial coordinates of nodes but the same pressure waves in the nodes. In particular, a locally “stretched” equivalent grid can be found that, theoretically, provides a sufficiently large region free from nodes and links. This property makes it possible to use these grids to construct ultrabroadband acoustic cloaks...|$|R
40|$|Longitude-time {{evolution}} of sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) reveals a slow southeastward propagation {{from the western}} North Pacific (WNP) around 20 °N to the Niño- 3. 4 region in the equatorial Central Pacific. The propagation is manifested as a narrow, southwest-northeast oriented SSTA band across the subtropical North Pacific, and its journey takes about 2 – 3 years. The propagating SSTA appears to engage the initiation of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The anomalies of surface winds, sea level <b>pressure,</b> <b>outgoing</b> longwave radiation, and velocity potential all exhibit a concurrent and distinct eastward propagation, one {{that appears to be}} circumglobal and is coupled with the predominant 4 – 5 year frequency of the ENSO cycle. It is suggested that the previously found warming/cooling in the Indian Ocean induced by El Niño/La Niña, the progressive SSTA and wind anomalies across the Indian Ocean towards the WNP, and the predominant 4 – 5 -year frequency of the North Pacific Oscillation collectively contribute to the reported SSTA propagation. The findings implicate that monitoring the SSTA propagation from the WNP towards the tropical central Pacific could be useful in tracking the ENSO development...|$|R
40|$|By {{implementing}} widely-used equations {{of state}} (EOS) from Lattimer & Swesty (LS) and H. Shen et al. (SHEN) in core-collapse supernova simulations, we explore possible impacts of these EOS on the post-bounce dynamics {{prior to the}} onset of neutrino-driven explosions. Our spherically symmetric (1 D) and axially symmetric (2 D) models are based on neutrino radiation hydrodynamics including spectral transport, which is solved by the isotropic diffusion source approximation. We confirm that in 1 D simulations neutrino-driven explosions cannot be obtained {{for any of the}} employed EOS. Impacts of the EOS on the post-bounce hydrodynamics are more clearly visible in 2 D simulations. In 2 D models of a 15 M_sun progenitor using the LS EOS, the stalled bounce shock expands to increasingly larger radii, which is not the case using the SHEN EOS. Keeping in mind that the omission of the energy drain by heavy-lepton neutrinos in the present scheme could facilitate explosions, we find that 2 D models of an 11. 2 M_sun progenitor produce neutrino-driven explosions for all the EOS under investigation. Models using the LS EOS are slightly more energetic compared to those with the SHEN EOS. The more efficient neutrino heating in the LS models coincides with a higher electron antineutrino luminosity and a larger mass that is enclosed within the gain region. The models based on the LS EOS also show a more vigorous and aspherical downflow of accreting matter {{to the surface of the}} protoneutron star (PNS). The accretion pattern is essential for the production and strength of <b>outgoing</b> <b>pressure</b> waves, that can push in turn the shock to larger radii and provide more favorable conditions for the explosion.

At typical landing speeds, the cylindrical cavity flow that develops past an aircraft fuel vent displays tonal convective streamwise instabilities.

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} assess the {{suitability}} of the heating fileds in {{the latest version of}} the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model (CCM 2) for modeling the thermal forcing of atmospheric tides. Accordingly, diurnal variations of the surface <b>pressure,</b> <b>outgoing</b> longwave radiation (OLR), cloudiness, and precipitation are examined in the CCM 2. The fields of radiative, sensible, and latent heating are similarly analyzed. These results are subjectively compared with available data. Equatorial diurnal surface pressure tides are fairly well simulated by CCM 2. The model successfully reproduces the semidiurnal surface pressure tides; however, this may result in part from reflection of wave energy at the upper boundary. The CCM 2 large-scale diurnal OLR is generally consistent with observations. The moist-convective scheme in the model is able to reproduce the diurnally varying cloudiness and precipitation patterns associated with land-sea contrasts; however, the amplitudes of CCM 2 diurnal continental convective cloudiness are weaker than observations. The CCM 2 boundary-layer sensible heating is consistent with a very limited set of observations, and with estimates obtained from simple models of diffusive heating. Although the CCM 2 tropospheric solar radiative heating is similar in magnitude to previous estimates, there are substantial differences in the vertical structures. A definitive assessment of the validity of the CCM 2 diurnal cycle is precluded by the lack of detailed observations and the limitations of our CCM 2 sample. Nevertheless, the authors conclude that the global-scale components of the CCM 2 diurnal heating are useful proxies for the true diurnal forcing of the tides...|$|R
