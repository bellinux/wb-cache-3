40|$|The thesis investigates if {{the use of}} {{a reserve}} seat system of {{parliamentary}} quotas that has produced a substantial descriptive {{increase in the number of}} women in the Tanzanian parliament has translated into substantive representation for women in terms of either process or outcome. It utilized the Tanzanian parliamentary database as its primary source of empirical data. From this it draws biographical details on the members of the parliaments, their membership of committees and their contribution to parliamentary debates. The study finds that the increase in the number of women has not produced a significant enhancement of substantive representation. Although women contribute as frequently as men to the parliament they are disadvantaged in terms <b>of</b> their <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> leadership as they have a lower level representation in the ‘prestige’ ministries and committees. Also debates on the issues of direct concern to women remain at a very low level both in term of the volume of contributions and the progressiveness of the content. However the overwhelming majority of contributions on women’s issues are made by women. The small number of contributions made by men tends to be of a conservative nature seeking to limit women’s freedom of choice and action. In addition to this in contradiction of some of the current literature, the thesis found no evidence that the reserve seat system was a pathway for women into constituency seats. ...|$|R

5000|$|Proponents {{of status}} {{dynamics}} are centrally concerned with persons’ statuses—these positions that they occupy {{in relation to}} everything in their worlds—because they see them as crucial determinants {{of the range of}} behaviors in which these persons are able to participate. They maintain that the crucial point of focussing on persons' statuses is that the <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> certain <b>positions</b> expands a person's eligibilities, opportunities, and reasons to act in valued ways (termed their [...] "behavior potential"123), while the <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> others constricts such behavior potential. A favored analogy1 that they use to illustrate this point involves military hierarchies, in which an individual might occupy the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> [...] "private" [...] or of [...] "general." [...] The mere <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> the latter <b>position</b> by an individual, they point out, carries with it a greatly expanded power and range of possible behaviors relative to the former. For example, a general, unlike a private, can give orders to virtually everyone else in the chain of command, can enjoy a host of officers’ privileges, and can have a far greater voice in important decisions. Critically, SDT proponents note, this greater behavior potential is completely independent of all the factors historically targeted for change by the major schools of psychotherapy such as the general’s beliefs, behavioral skills, motives, and biochemical states. Proceeding from this analogy, SDT adherents maintain, and seek to therapeutically exploit the fact that, all relational positions convey varying degrees of behavior potential.|$|R

In order to evaluate {{the extent to which}} individuals are rich because they enjoy a differentiated family structure, this study tests three hypotheses concerning inequalities between the rich and the non-rich, relating the advantage of the rich to: a peculiar demographic structure (fertility levels, position in the life cycle, etc.); higher employment and greater yield of available labor (workforce participation and employment rates, length <b>of</b> workday); or <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> better <b>positions</b> in the work market (higher remuneration). The hypothesis testing is based on a breakdown of families' per capita income, using data from the Brazilian National Household Sample Surveys (PNADs) from 1997, 1998, and 1999.

40|$|Egalitarian liberal {{theories}} of justice – so this dissertation argues – {{fail to take}} into accountthe full implications of the way citizens’ socio-cultural backgrounds work to undermine theequal opportunities these same theories demand. While egalitarians support extensiveredistribution of income and wealth from the privileged to the less privileged, and advocateequal opportunities for all, they do not properly attend either to how our shared societalcultures structure social esteem and related advantages, or to how our individual socioculturalenvironments structure {{the very act of}} choice. They thus fail to acknowledge ourunequal opportunities to make choices which bring us esteem and related advantages,particularly the advantages that flow from our having established for ourselves lives thatothers consider good. Alternative approaches to the interplay between justice, culture, and choice are rejected forillegitimately restricting the right to go our own way (communitarianism), or for regulatingpolitically that which cannot legitimately be regulated politically (recognition theory). Against the former position it is argued that we should draw on our culturalunderstandings, not to restrict free choice, but to identify opportunities to be safeguarded. Against the latter it is argued that we should not renegotiate prevailing cultural structurespolitically, but rather acknowledge these same structures and ensure that no one falls too farbehind in the competition for the advantages they generate. Suggesting that one of the more thoroughgoing hierarchies of esteem and disesteem is thatattached to our occupational positions, broadly construed, the dissertation concretizes theclaims defended in relation to this hierarchy in particular. It is argued that the just societyowes it to its citizens to protect them from involuntary <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> that comewith potentially harmful disesteem attached. It is not for society to overrule theindependent choices of citizens, however, but rather to provide enduring opportunities totraining and education for more highly regarded positions, thus both equalizingopportunities to esteem and related advantages, and ensuring that those who continue tooccupy positions {{at the lower end of}} the hierarchy in question do so through their owngenuinely free choice...|$|R
