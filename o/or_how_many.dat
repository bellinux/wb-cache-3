Mints located in the old Danelaw, like York and Lincoln, contained a preponderance of moneyers with Scandinavian names, whilst one sometimes comes across moneyers all over the country with continental names, or even more exotic names in Old Irish.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{technical}} challenges {{depending on the}} subject, what the photographer wants to highlight, <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> subjects are in the frame. Therefore, photographing a single person and, for instance, if the photographer wants to highlight {{only half of the}} subject's face, a single light source placed laterally, at a certain distance and angle to the subject, and possibly a blend, will be usually used. Experimenting with different light intensities is performed until the desired effect is achieved. For photographing two people or a static scene, two or even three sources of light (one or two for contour, and a very low-intensity fill light) are usually used.|$|E

25|$|It {{was also}} the missions' {{responsibility}} to provide the Spanish forts, or presidios, with the necessary foodstuffs, and manufactured goods to sustain operations. It was a constant point of contention between missionaries and the soldiers as to how many fanegas of barley, <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> shirts or blankets the mission had to provide the garrisons on any given year. At times these requirements were hard to meet, especially during years of drought, or when the much anticipated shipments from the port of San Blas failed to arrive. The Spaniards kept meticulous records of mission activities, and each year reports submitted to the Father-Presidente summarizing both the material and spiritual status {{at each of the}} settlements.|$|E
25|$|This {{legal system}} of racial {{classification}} based on patrilineal descent had no parallel {{anywhere in the}} Spanish-ruled colonies in the Americas. In general, a son born of a sangley male and an indio or mestizo de sangley female was classified as mestizo de sangley; all subsequent male descendants were mestizos de sangley {{regardless of whether they}} married an India or a mestiza de sangley. A daughter born in such a manner, however, acquired the legal classification of her husband, i.e., she became an India if she married an indio but remained a mestiza de sangley if she married a mestizo de sangley or a sangley. In this way, a chino mestizo male descendant of a paternal sangley ancestor never lost his legal status as a mestizo de sangley no matter how little percentage of Chinese blood he had in his veins <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> generations had passed since his first Chinese ancestor; he was thus a mestizo de sangley in perpetuity.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics are}} autobiographical and portray Azalea's fame-seeking {{relocation}} from Mullumbimby to Miami {{at the age}} of 16, and deal with subjects of work ethic and dedication to craft. It specifically accounts for the events of Azalea growing up in Mullumbimby, juggling multiple occupations to save an income to independently start anew in Miami. The lyrics also serve as a celebration of Azalea's progression from being a struggling rapper as a rags to riches story and an underdog anthem. The line [...] "Who don't know shit 'bout where I was made / <b>Or</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> floors that I had to scrub," [...] was suggested to be directed at her [...] "haters".

500|$|Golubac's {{early history}} is uncertain. [...] Inscriptions and {{evidence}} of older defensive structures in the area show {{the presence of a}} Roman settlement, sometimes named [...] "Columbaria," [...] long before the creation of Golubac. From 803 to 1018, the area belonged to the First Bulgarian Empire, to the Byzantine Empire from then until 1193, and the Second Bulgarian Empire until 1257. The area remained in Serbian hands from then until the Ottoman conquest in the 15th century, with control of the region changing many times between Hungarians, Bulgarians and Serbs before then. It is also unclear whether the medieval fortress was built by Bulgarians, Serbs or Hungarians, <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> towers it had originally. However, an Orthodox chapel built as part of one tower shows that it, at least, was built by a local noble. There is also uncertainty about when construction started, although it is generally agreed {{that the majority of the}} fortress was built early in the 14th century.|$|E
500|$|Others have {{expressed}} more negative sentiments. The English pianist Ian Pace describes Sorabji's music {{as that of}} [...] "a massive ego thoroughly unaware of its crushing banality."; whilst it is unclear on which <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of Sorabji's works such a view might have been based, none appears to have entered his repertoire at any time, so it has not arisen from personal experience of performing any of them. The music critic Andrew Clements calls Sorabji [...] "just another 20th-century English eccentric... whose talent never matched [...] musical ambition." [...] The music journalist Max Harrison, in his review of Rapoport's book Sorabji: A Critical Celebration, heavily criticised Sorabji's compositions, piano playing, music criticism and personal conduct and implied that [...] "nobody cared except a few close friends", although such observations were {{in marked contrast to}} the enthusiastic reception of Yonty Solomon's London performances of some of those works in his published reviews in British newspapers.|$|E
500|$|Ring Mountain, a flow-dominated tuya lying at the {{northern}} portion of the Mount Cayley volcanic field, consists of a pile of at least five andesite lava flows lying on a mountain ridge.

This {{makes it impossible to}} measure its exact base elevation <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> lava flows constitute the edifice. With a summit elevation of , Ring Mountain had its last volcanic activity between 25,000and 10,000years ago when the Fraser Glaciation was close to its maximum. Northwest of Ring Mountain lies a minor andesite lava flow. Its chemistry is somewhat unlike other andesite flows comprising Ring Mountain, but it probably erupted from a volcanic vent adjacent to or at Ring Mountain. The part of it that lies higher in elevation contains some features that indicate lava-ice interactions, while the lower-elevation portion of it does not. Therefore, this minor lava flow was likely extruded after Ring Mountain formed but when glacial ice covered a broader area than it does to this day, and that the lava flowed beyond the region in which glacial ice existed at that time.|$|E
