5|$|Baker was {{promoted}} to temporary captain and made a flight commander in No.4 Squadron on 24 October. Two days later, Baker and Lieutenant Thomas Barkell led a formation of nine Snipes. As the patrol drew near Tournai in the afternoon, they intercepted a group of 15 Fokker D.VIIs. The Snipes swept towards the German aircraft, and Baker attempted to engage the formation leader, but the machine guns on his Snipe jammed. He brought in his aircraft for a second attempt, and managed to shoot the Fokker down <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> <b>In</b> all, the Australians destroyed five of the Fokkers before the engagement ended.|$|E
5|$|In 1980-81 {{representatives from}} the Eastern Bloc nations met at the Kremlin to discuss the Polish situation. Brezhnev {{eventually}} concluded on 10 December 1981 {{that it would be}} better to leave the domestic matters of Poland alone, reassuring the Polish delegates that the USSR would intervene only if asked to. This effectively marked the end of the Brezhnev Doctrine.

5|$|On 8 January 2010, CBC News Network's The Fifth Estate {{broadcast}} {{a documentary about}} the case titled <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control.</b> <b>In</b> the documentary, reporter Hana Gartner describes Smith as a fourteen-year-old placed in a youth facility for one month in 2003 after throwing crabapples at the mailman. Smith was placed in solitary confinement after disruptive behaviour on her first day. Her initial one-month sentence would last almost four years, entirely in isolation, until her death in 2007. Often violent and unpredictable, her behaviours and the force required to intervene were always filmed and recorded, then listed on daily logs. Behaviour that Smith exhibited included many attempts at choking herself into unconsciousness; guards responding were often attacked by Smith, sometimes with weapons she had manufactured and concealed.|$|E

Israel immediately sent three airtankers on 19 June, and an additional plane carrying 36 cubic meters of firefighting foam flew to the island on 20 June, per the Cypriot government request. Greece, Britain, Italy and France also sent helicopters and planes to aid in the firefighting efforts.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{planned to}} hold 300,000 refugees, the {{population}} eventually reached 160,000 in March 1980. Later, as KID became the main holding center for refugees awaiting third country visas, illegal {{entry to the}} camp became highly sought after by refugees desperate to escape from Cambodia, and smuggling, theft and violence spiraled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> <b>In</b> July and August 1980 UNHCR began transferring large numbers of refugees out of KID to Phanat Nikhom, Sa Kaeo II, Mairut, and Kap Choeng.

25|$|Beside {{the danger}} of people {{receiving}} burns from the fire or embers, campfires may spread into a larger fire. A campfire may burn <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>in</b> two basic ways: {{on the ground or}} in the trees. Dead leaves or pine needles on the ground may ignite from direct contact with burning wood, or from thermal radiation. If a root, particularly a dead one, is exposed to fire, it may smoulder underground and ignite the parent tree long after the original fire is doused and the campers have left the area. Alternatively, airborne embers (or their smaller kin, sparks) may ignite dead material in overhanging branches. This latter threat is less likely, but a fire in a branch is extremely difficult to put out without firefighting equipment, and may spread more quickly than a ground fire.|$|E

25|$|USS Ferret {{was part}} of a naval fleet that sailed to the Caribbean to subdue the {{occurrence}} of pirate raids on merchant ships that had increased to almost 3,000 by the early 1820s. The financial losses to the United States was great while murder and the practice of torture were common. Losses to American ships and merchants had increased to such proportions that the situation began making headlines in American newspapers. In little time merchants and shippers along with the American public were demanding that the U.S. Navy take definite action against piracy that was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. In November 1822 when the captain of the USS Alligator was killed in a battle with the notorious Cuban pirate Domingo that was the last straw. Response was quick and by 22 December President James Monroe authorized the creation of the West Indies squadron for purposes of seeking and routing out pirates and their numerous strongholds about the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. They were also directed to suppress the international slave trade which also operated out of this region and outlawed in the United States. Following Monroe's authorization the Secretary of the Navy, Smith Thompson, promoted David Porter to commodore, allocated $500,000 to him and appointed him to take commanded of and outfit the squadron for war against the pirates. British interests in the Caribbean also threatened, the West Indies squadron fought piracy in a concerted effort with the Royal Navy.|$|E
500|$|The 262-foot-long (80 m) Broadwalk is {{the main}} axis of the gardens and {{separates}} the glasshouses from the 328-foot-long (100 m) Oval Lawn, planted with lime trees and yews.

500|$|The Battle of the Nive {{ended on}} 13 December 1813 when Wellington's army repulsed {{the last of}} Soult's assaults. This ended the {{fighting}} for the year. Soult had found the Allied army divided by the Nive River but failed to inflict a damaging defeat. The French then pulled back within Bayonne's defenses and entered winter quarters. Heavy rains brought operations to a standstill {{for the next two}} months. [...] After the Battle of Nivelle on 10 November 1813, Wellington's Spanish troops had gone <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>in</b> seized French villages. Horrified at the idea of provoking a guerilla war by French civilians, the British commander imposed a vigorous discipline on his British and Portuguese soldiers and sent most of his Spanish troops home. Since his men were paid and fed by the British government, Pablo Morillo's Spanish division remained with the army. Wellington's policy paid dividends; his soldiers soon found that guarding the roads in his army's rear areas was no longer required.|$|E

Producer Daniel Lanois said, [...] "it was a long jam, and there was just this one section of it that had some kind of magic to it, and we just decided to turn it into something." [...] Producer Brian Eno edited the jam down to the end length. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "it started off as an exercise in playing together with a kind of mood and a place in mind. And it really, for me, it brought me there, it really did succeed as an experiment."

[...] On 19 March, many counter-revolutionary suspects were rounded up and the republicans inflicted their own massacres: in La Rochelle, six non-juring priests were hacked to death and their heads (and other body parts) shown throughout the city. [...] About a week later, the insurgents from Machecoul seized the neighboring harbor town of Pornic (approximately [...] to the northwest) on 23 March, [...] this time joined by some of the irregular army that had been forming elsewhere, and sacked it. [...] A republican patrol surprised the Vendeans, who were carousing on liberated cellars, and killed between 200 and 500 of them. [...] The angry peasants returned to Machecoul and in reprisal killed another dozen prisoners on 27 March. In total, about 200 died (not all in the battle), and when the survivors of Pornic returned to Machecoul, they pulled the detained [...] "blue coats" [...] out of the prisoner and shot them, a process that lasted over the next few weeks, into mid-April.|$|E

[...] "Maybe the group Sea Turtle Conservation with Guns should be formed to fight back." [...] An editorial published by the Tico Times asked why it took a murder to get the government to act. [...] "Mora reached out for help before he was killed, and no one came to the rescue, no matter what political spin is put on it", said the author. [...] Mora's death, suggested the author, shows that [...] "the drug traffickers are winning", that crime is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>in</b> Limón, and that [...] "the bad guys operate with near impunity."

500|$|On April 14, 2009, MTV News {{announced}} that Ellis had nearly finished {{the novel and}} it would be published in May 2010. At the time, Ellis revealed that all the novel's main characters would return. Prior to publication, Ellis had been convinced by his persuasive editor to remove some of the more graphic lines from Imperial Bedrooms torture scenes, which he later regretted. [...] "My most extreme act of self-censoring in Imperial Bedrooms," [...] he said, however, was to omit a three-line description of a silver wall, because he felt that Clay would never have written it. Ellis stated he had no plans to make changes to the book as it stands in a second edition. Months prior to the book's release, Ellis tweeted the first sentence of the novel, [...] "They had made a movie about us." [...] The Random House website later announced the on sale date of June 22, 2010 in both hardback and paperback. With it, they released a picture of the book's cover and a short synopsis, which described the book as focusing on a middle-aged Clay, now a screenwriter, drawn back into his old circle. Amidst this, Clay begins dating a young actress with mysterious ties to Julian, Rip and a recently murdered Hollywood producer; his life begins to spin <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> <b>In</b> Imperial Bedrooms, Los Angeles returns once again as the book's setting.

500|$|Kneale's concept {{concerned}} [...] "the {{world of}} the future, {{and a way of}} keeping the population happy without being active". According to Kneale, the notion for the play came from the [...] "worldwide dread of populations exploding out of all control" [...] leading him to devise a world where pornography hooks the population [...] "on a substitute for sex rather than the real thing and so keeping the population down". Kneale was also influenced by the dropout counterculture of the late 1960s, recalling [...] "I didn't like the Sixties at all because of the whole thing of 'let it all hang out' and let's stop thinking [...] which was the all too frequent theme of the Sixties which I hated". Dissatisfaction with the youth culture of the time was a preoccupation of Kneale's—in the mid-sixties he had worked on The Big, Big, Giggle, an unmade script about a teenage suicide cult, and following The Year of the Sex Olympics he returned to the theme of youth <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>in</b> his 1969 play Bam! Pow! Zapp!, and in the fourth and final Quatermass serial in 1979. Many cultural icons of the youth movement, including members of The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Monty Python, were fans of Kneale's work. For The Year of the Sex Olympics Kneale extrapolated the possible consequences of the youth movement's desire for freedom from [...] "traditional" [...] cultural inhibitions, asking as the academic John R. Cook puts it, [...] "In a world of no limits, will the result quickly be apathy if there is nothing any more to get excited about, nothing precious or illicit to fight for in the teeth of the censor?".|$|E
