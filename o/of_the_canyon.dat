5|$|State Route 133, locally called Laguna Canyon Road, {{winds through}} Laguna Canyon {{for the entire}} length of the gorge. California State Route 73 bisects the gorge east-west. The lower section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> is part of the Laguna Coast Wilderness, while the upper section also has a few smaller {{wilderness}} preserves. The upper section contains the Laguna Lakes, a series of small natural lakes formed by groundwater rising along a local fault line, which are the namesake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon.</b> A section of the lower canyon within the city limits of Laguna Beach is heavily developed. The northernmost extreme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> lies near a residential area that adjoins Interstate 405.|$|E
5|$|The Park {{contains}} several well-marked trails {{which allow}} visitors {{to view the}} geology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> and its surroundings, which spans millions of years.|$|E
5|$|As it {{continues}} through the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, SR 133 follows a four-lane alignment {{on the west}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon,</b> moved from the old two-lane road in the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> in late 2006. Laguna Canyon Road splits to the northwest where the canyon ends in Irvine. North of the park, the highway becomes the Laguna Freeway after crossing an at-grade intersection with Laguna Canyon Road, followed by an interchange at exit 8, San Diego Freeway (I-405). SR 133 then continues as a freeway and serves Barranca Parkway and the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5). After crossing I-5, SR 133 becomes part of the Eastern Toll Road along the northwest side of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, crossing an interchange with Irvine Boulevard at exit 12 before ending at SR 241.|$|E
50|$|Academy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canyons</b> (AOC) is {{a public}} middle college high school in Santa Clarita, California, United States. The school, which enrolls {{students}} from the 9th to the 12th grade, is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> William S. Hart High School District. It is located on <b>the</b> College <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canyons</b> campus where <b>the</b> students <b>of</b> AOC are concurrently enrolled. Those who are enrolled take high school classes on <b>the</b> College <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canyons</b> campus and take college courses at COC. During grades 9-12 students can earn up to 80 college units, enough to receive an associate degree. A few students at Academy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canyons</b> have also received multiple associate degrees by or before their high school graduation. A bonus is that high school students will also receive a College <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canyons</b> I.D. card and a 25 Score Card.

5|$|Geologically, {{the canyon}} likely {{originated}} {{millions of years}} ago as the result of San Diego Creek cutting through the San Joaquin Hills. Uplift diverted that stream to its present course, leaving Laguna Canyon as a wind gap. California State Route 133 runs the entire length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> connecting Laguna Beach and Irvine, while California State Route 73 crosses it, running southeast-northwest. A majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> is located within the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park; small portions are part of Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park and the cities of Irvine, Laguna Beach, Laguna Woods and Aliso Viejo.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} no major flood control dams on Aliso Creek itself, there are 19drop {{structures}}, and while doing nothing to reduce the creek's rainy season surges, the drop structures were constructed to mitigate the catastrophic erosion {{that came with the}} creek's increased flow. Although the creek has a wide floodplain throughout most of Aliso Canyon, a major bottleneck lies at the south end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> where a sharp bend in the creek is constricted between crowded development and steep cliffs. In flooding events, this area generally sustains heavy damage.|$|E
5|$|Heeding Bryant's advice, Palmer {{decided to}} route the {{railroad}} south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> and in March 1883, it completed its connection to Salt Lake City {{and for a}} brief period the canyon was on the main line of a transcontinental railroad system. While the railroad and early visitors used the canyon as a path to Utah and mines to the southwest, later visitors came to see the canyon as an opportunity for recreation and personal enjoyment.|$|E

5|$|Logging resumed in 1912 in {{the north}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon,</b> where The Boone's Ferry Wood and Tie Company had a site near what became Alfred Street. A sawmill and steam donkey engine {{operated}} near the future sites of Beaver Bridge and Obie's Bridge. The lumber was used chiefly for railroad ties, cordwood and flagpoles, and left huge cedar stumps that remain in the park. Intermittent logging continued through 1961, and a 1962 windstorm known as the Columbus Day Storm blew down many remaining trees.|$|E
5|$|Nankoweap Formation {{is around}} 1050million {{years old and}} {{is not part of}} a group. This rock unit is made of {{coarse-grained}} sandstone, and was deposited in a shallow sea on top of the eroded surface of the Cardenas Basalt. The Nankoweap is only exposed in the eastern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon.</b> A gap in the geologic record, an unconformity, follows the Nankoweap.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} moissanite {{is found}} in only minute quantities in certain types of meteorite and in corundum deposits and kimberlite. Virtually all the silicon carbide sold in the world, including moissanite jewels, is synthetic. Natural moissanite was first found in 1893 as a small component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canyon</b> Diablo meteorite in Arizona by Dr. Ferdinand Henri Moissan, after whom the material was named in 1905. Moissan's discovery of naturally occurring SiC was initially disputed because his sample may have been contaminated by silicon carbide saw blades that were already on the market at that time.|$|E

5|$|Fishers, {{medium-sized}} weasels, were reintroduced to Pine Creek Gorge {{as part of}} {{an effort}} to establish a healthy population of fishers in Pennsylvania. Prior to the lumber era, fishers were numerous throughout the forests of Pennsylvania. They are generalized predators and will hunt any smaller creatures in their territory, including porcupines. Elk have been reintroduced west of the gorge in Clinton County and occasionally wander near the west rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon.</b> Coyotes have come back on their own. Invasive insect species in the gorge include gypsy moth larvae, which eat all the leaves off trees, especially oaks, and hemlock woolly adelgids, which weaken and kill hemlocks. Invasive plant species include purple loosestrife and Japanese knotweed.|$|E
5|$|Opening of the firstand onlypiece of the Laguna Freeway {{was celebrated}} in Laguna Beach on October 1, 1952, {{connecting}} {{the north end}} of Laguna Canyon with a planned extension of the Santa Ana Freeway at a trumpet interchange and bypassing the old route on Sand Canyon Avenue. There were initially no other interchanges along the route. The state decided not to build the remainder of the freeway in late 1975, and in 1996 the portion south of SR 73 was removed from the Freeway and Expressway System. Widening of the part north of SR 73 to a four-lane expressway was completed in late 2006, moving the road out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> bottom and allowing better access to areas in Laguna Coast Wilderness Park.|$|E
5|$|Paintings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh were {{exhibited}} at the Saint Louis World's Fair in 1904, followed by a glowing article in Scribner's Magazine the next year. That, along with previously created photographs, paintings, and reports, led to President William Howard Taft's proclamation on July 31, 1909 that created Mukuntuweap National Monument. In 1917, the {{acting director of the}} newly created National Park Service visited the canyon and proposed changing its name from the locally unpopular Mukuntuweap to Zion, a name used by the local Mormon community. The United States Congress added more land and established Zion National Park on November 19, 1919. A separate Zion National Monument, the Kolob Canyons area, was proclaimed on January 22, 1937, and was incorporated into the park on July 11, 1956.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{historic}} environmental events <b>of</b> 1989, including <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Tell photographic mural, as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Laguna <b>Canyon</b> Project, and <b>the</b> subsequent “Walk to Save Laguna Canyon” that culminated at this outdoor public installation, a bond measure {{was passed in}} 1990 by Laguna Beach voters; after which <b>the</b> Laguna <b>Canyon</b> Foundation was formed to manage preservation <b>of</b> Laguna <b>Canyon.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Canyon</b> Foundation soon facilitated <b>the</b> purchase <b>of</b> additional sections of open space that had been slated for development, and in 1993, established Laguna Coast Wilderness Park.

40|$|<b>The</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{submarine}} <b>canyons</b> on <b>the</b> coastal sediments capture in <b>the</b> Gulf <b>of</b> Taranto In <b>the</b> {{submerged area}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gulf <b>of</b> Taranto many submarine canyons are located. They {{play an important}} role in <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> terrigenous deposits from coastal toward deeper basins. When the sediments, coming along the shelf, intersect <b>the</b> heads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyons,</b> fall down in his bed flowing toward greater depth as gravity flows. Moreover to such transfer <b>of</b> sediment, <b>the</b> erosion and <b>the</b> widening <b>of</b> <b>canyons,</b> as well as <b>the</b> progressive reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continental shelf, is occurred. <b>The</b> characters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sediments on the investigated areas underline the role that these forms have in the sedimentary dispersion; the slope and basin deposits show <b>the</b> same characteristics <b>of</b> shelf sediments to testify their origin in coastal areas and allows to suppose the transport ways conditioned by the narrow section shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyons.</b> <b>The</b> sandy deposits located in areas with narrow shelf are transported by coastal currents and captured by canyons heads, where they are trapped and used as source of periodic turbidity currents moving towards deeper areas...|$|R
5|$|The highway then ascends Ghost Rock Summit, {{the highest}} point for I-70 inside the swell. At the summit is another view area {{overlooking}} the Little Grand Canyon of the San Rafael River. The summit is named for unusual rock formations nearby. The Ghost Rocks themselves are at , although the freeway is slightly lower. I-70 meanders through a relatively flat portion of the swell until reaching Spotted Wolf Canyon, which provides the exit route to the swell. The eastern descent features one brake check area and two runaway truck ramps to aid trucks down. About halfway down is a view area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> narrowing as it approaches the eastern escarpment of the swell, the San Rafael Reef. Just as the highway exits the swell it passes {{to the north of}} Goblin Valley State Park. The highway exits the swell near Green River.|$|E
5|$|The temple is D-shaped, and its {{alignment}} is 10.7 degrees off true east-west. Its {{location and}} orientation indicate that its builders understood {{the cycles of}} both {{the sun and the}} moon. It is aligned to the major lunar standstill, which occurs once every 18.6 years, and the sunset during the winter solstice, which can be viewed setting over the temple from a platform {{at the south end of}} Cliff Palace, across Fewkes Canyon. At the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> is the Sun Temple fire pit, which is illuminated by the first rays of the rising sun during the winter solstice. Sun Temple is one of the largest exclusively ceremonial structures ever built by the Ancestral Puebloans.|$|E
5|$|When Bart, Lisa and Maggie {{come home}} from trick-or-treating, Marge {{switches}} out the candy with dental hygiene products and asks Homer to deliver the candy to a drive for the troops overseas. Homer instead runs off with the bag to eat its contents in privacy at a canyon cliff. Unfortunately, Homer trips and falls to the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> with his arm pinned. Fueled by his {{need to get the}} out-of-reach bag of candy, and reluctant to wait twenty minutes for help, Homer is forced to chew off his arm. Though he manages it after a few tries, Homer learns that he was carrying a bag of vegetables, as Bart, Lisa and Maggie had secretly stolen back their candy, inciting an upset Homer to scream in rage.|$|E
50|$|Eos Chaos {{is a part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>canyon</b> {{system in}} <b>the</b> solar system; this great canyon would go almost {{all the way across}} the United States. The name for <b>the</b> whole system <b>of</b> <b>canyons</b> is Valles Marineris. Starting at the west with Noctis Labyrinthus in the Phoenicis Lacus {{quadrangle}}, <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> system ends in the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle with Capri Chasma and Eos Chasma (in the south). The word Chasma has been designated by the International Astronomical Union to refer to an elongate, steep-sided depression. Valles Marineris was discovered by and named for the Mariner 9 mission. Moving east from Noctis Labyrinthus, <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> splits into two troughs, Tithonium and Ius Chasma in the south. In <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system are very wide valleys of Ophir Chasma (north), Candor Chasma, and Melas Chasma (south). Going farther to the east, one comes to Coprates Chasma. At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> Coprates Chasma, <b>the</b> valley gets wider to form Capri Chasma in the north and Eos Chasma in the south. <b>The</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> often contain many layers. <b>The</b> floors <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> contain large deposits of layered materials. Some researchers believe that the layers were formed when water once filled <b>the</b> <b>canyons.</b> <b>The</b> <b>canyons</b> are deep as well as long. In places they are 8-10 kilometers deep. Remember <b>the</b> Earth's Grand <b>Canyon</b> is only 1.6 kilometers deep.|$|R
50|$|All {{the trails}} {{dropping}} into <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> are moderate {{but they can}} be difficult, if not impossible, to find and follow until you reach <b>the</b> bottoms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyons.</b> Peavine Canyon contains a cherry-stem jeep trail.

5|$|Most of Thistle's {{residents}} were railroad employees sent {{to live in}} the town, but there were some who had settled before the railroads arrived. The first Europeans were part of the Mormon migration to Utah, and the first of these was the Pace family, who migrated from Nauvoo, Illinois, reaching Thistle in 1848. Fifth-generation descendants of the Pace settlers continued to operate a family-owned cattle ranch until the town was evacuated. Other settlers included Mormons who originally settled elsewhere in Utah but subsequently arrived to homestead fertile ground on Billies Mountain, on the north wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon.</b> Among them was the mountain's presumed namesake, William Johnson. Homesteading was practiced in Thistle until the early 1900s. Until the arrival of the railroads, the town's economy was based mainly on farming and ranching, although there was also some mining activity in the region, including a vein of asphaltum that was mined between 1892 and 1914.|$|E
5|$|SR57 {{begins at}} the Orange Crush {{interchange}} near downtown Orange, where it meets the northwest–southeast Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) and the east–west Garden Grove Freeway (SR22). The Orange Crush interchange, which had long been considered a major bottleneck, was rebuilt in the 1990s and 2000s. The freeway heads north from the junction and soon crosses to {{the west side of}} the Santa Ana River, continuing north through suburban portions of Anaheim and passing next to Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center, Angel Stadium and Honda Center. In northern Anaheim, SR57 meets the Riverside Freeway (SR 91). SR57 briefly passes through Placentia and Fullerton, providing access to California State University, Fullerton. As it crosses Imperial Highway (SR 90) near the Brea Mall and enters Brea, SR57 enters more rugged terrain before climbing through Brea Canyon, the gap between the Chino Hills and Puente Hills. Near the rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon,</b> the highway curves north out of the Brea Canyon, and descends slightly to a junction with the Pomona Freeway (SR 60) in Diamond Bar, right on the edge of the San Gabriel Valley.|$|E
5|$|The LaSalle Street {{canyon is}} home to other {{historic}} buildings including the Rookery Building, a National Historic Landmark {{considered to be the}} oldest standing high-rise. A 1907 renovation included a lobby remodeled by Frank Lloyd Wright in the Prairie School style. The name rookery comes from the previous building on the property which became home to many birds, especially pigeons. The nearby Reliance Building was the first skyscraper to have large plate glass windows comprise the majority of its surface area, and One North LaSalle was for some time one of Chicago's tallest buildings. Both the Reliance Building and One North LaSalle are on the National Register of Historic Places. Since 1853, the governments of Chicago and Cook County have shared three different buildings at the north end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon.</b> The current Chicago City Hall, built in a Classical Revival style, was designed to symbolize the strength, dignity, and vigor of the government. Completed in 2001, an award-winning green roof was incorporated into the structure. All of the structures are designated as Chicago Landmarks.|$|E
