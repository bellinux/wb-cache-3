40|$|Accessibility {{measures}} {{the potential of}} opportunities for interaction. This paper proposes a new flow-based accessibility measure, “place rank ” utilizing origin-destination information. Both impedance and value of opportunities are embedded in the dataset that includes <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destination</b> of each person utilizing the studied region. Individuals contribute to the accessibility level in their destination (work) zone with a different power. The power of the contribution depends on the attractiveness of the zone of origin. In this paper we demonstrate place rank measure of accessibility to three activities (Jobs, Resident Workers and Health Services) in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan region. In addition we compare the place rank measure to traditional gravity based and cumulative opportunity measures of accessibility. Since this measure is based on people’s actual choices of <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations</b> it is more comprehensive then previous accessibility measures in terms of impedance and opportunity calculations. Also {{it does not require}} the knowledge of travel time between <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations...</b>|$|R

25|$|Several {{factors may}} {{determine}} the extent to which circular migration is impactful upon the return of the migrant. First, the size of the returning population is important, as large numbers of migrants may form a critical mass necessary for true change to occur. Second, the duration of the absence of the migrants is influential, as too short of an absence brings little change and too long of an absence leads to difficulties in readjustment. Third, it is important to consider social class, as the elite may have a greater impact than unskilled workers. Fourth, the extent to which the <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> <b>destination</b> areas are different can have an effect, as those who migrate to metropolitan areas will have a greater impact if returning to an urban rather than a rural area. Lastly, the quantity and quality of the skills that the migrant acquires while abroad can determine the impact of migration.|$|E
25|$|Work is an {{important}} factor in determining the duration and frequency of the migration. The circular nature allows for a migrant worker to take advantage of employment opportunities in both the <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> <b>destination</b> countries, as they become available. The economy and job opportunities of the location of origin are often {{an important}} determinant of migration. In addition, circular migration is influenced by labor market segmentation, because the working populations in many high-income countries are less likely to be employed in low-wage and low-status jobs, instead leaving these positions to migrants. Employers often look for the cheapest labor in areas with little connection to the potential destination markets, and this expanding labor frontier is slowly linking the most rural of areas with urban centers. Furthermore, the variety of occupations in the international labor market has increased. For example, in many middle-income countries, migrants provide much of the labor in the agricultural, construction, and domestic service industries.|$|E
40|$|Territorial {{aggregation}} is {{an important}} issue in many traditional applications, such as political districting, plant location, health care zoning, and travel demand study. In particular, in travel demand analysis one is interested in estimating travel flows between <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations.</b> The number of trips performed between <b>origin</b> i <b>and</b> <b>destination</b> j is represented by the (i, j) -th entry of an Origin-Destination (OD) matrix. In order to define the OD matrix, a discrete set of <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations</b> is needed, <b>and</b> territorial aggregation methods are used precisely to choose these <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations.</b> Typically, a survey is performed to collect data on travel between the selected <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations.</b> However, when the survey OD matrix is large and sparse, problems in the estimation of travel demand may arise. This drawback can be avoided by further aggregating the <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations</b> on which travel demand is evaluated and by obtaining a new and smaller OD matrix where each cell entry carries a greater value. The corresponding map is then exploited to calibrate the statistical model used to estimate the original disaggregated travel flows. In this work, we first suggest a set of optimality criteria which can be used to find "good" territorial aggregations and we adopt the Old Bachelor Acceptance heuristic to identify them. In order to understand the trade-off between these criteria, we introduce appropriate optimality indexes and we minimize their weighted combinations with several different sets of weights. Our application refers to the city of Rome and the actual study, which involved statisticians, engineers and operations researchers, was supported by the local government (Comune di Roma). Our experimental results on the city of Rome show that the Old Bachelor Acceptance heuristic finds aggregations with low values for all the indexes simultaneously. In particular, our results lead to the conclusion that certain sets of weights must be adopted if one wants to be sure to find "good" aggregations...|$|R

The approach is then generalised to handle data collected at any number of <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations.</b> Finally, the performance of the proposed method is studied in applications to simulated data sets, where the solution yielded by the algorithm is compared with the (known) true matching of the data. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the demand for commodity transportation using the conventional sequential modelling approach. In this study, the amounts of productions and consumptions of commodities at various locations were obtained from a commodity flow survey (shipper and consignee type) conducted by Alberta Transportation, Edmonton, in 1977 and 1978. Optimized gravity model for distribution and Log-linear and Logit models for modal split were developed from the above survey data. These models are discussed in this paper. The above three stages of modelling process yield the demand for commodities between <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations</b> in the province of Alberta. Demands for commodities (flows) are represented graphically in the form of commodity flow diagrams (CFD) between the population centres (<b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations).</b> They also show the demand for commodities between <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations</b> by different modes, truck and rail. The CFDs for a few selected centres are shown to indicate the pattern of commodity flows across the province. They indicate that truck transport dominates the movement of all commodities. The modelling procedures and the results shown in this paper are applicable for transportation planning. ...|$|R

40|$|People travel between {{places of}} {{residence}} <b>and</b> work <b>destinations</b> via transportation networks. The relation between selection {{of home and}} work locations has been heavily debated in the transportation planning literature. In this paper we use circuity, the ratio of network to Euclidean distance, {{to better understand the}} choice of residential location relative to work. This is done using two methods of defining <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations</b> in twenty metropolitan regions in the United States, with more detailed analysis of Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota and Portland, Oregon. The first method of selection is based on actual choice of residence and work locations. The second is based on a randomly selected dataset of <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations</b> in the same regions, followed by a comparison between the two methods for these regions. The study shows circuity measured through randomly selected <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations</b> differs from circuity measured from actual <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations.</b> Workers tend to reside in areas such that the journey to work circuity is lower than random, applying intelligence to their location decisions. Consistent with traditional urban economic theory, this suggests locators wish to locate on the frontier with the largest residential lot at the shortest commute time, but in contrast with the classic model which simplifies transportation networks to be uniform, we cannot assume that all possible home-work pairs are on the frontier. This finding, developed from microscopic data not previously used for this question, reveals an important issue related to residence choice and location theory and how resident workers tend to locate with respect to network configuration in an urban context.
