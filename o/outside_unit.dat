50|$|Advantages of the {{ductless}} system include smaller {{size and}} flexibility for zoning or {{heating and cooling}} individual rooms. The inside wall space required is significantly reduced. Also, the compressor and heat exchanger can be located {{farther away from the}} inside space, rather than merely {{on the other side of}} the same unit as in a PTAC or window air conditioner. Flexible exterior hoses lead from the <b>outside</b> <b>unit</b> to the interior one(s); these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof. In addition, ductless systems offer higher efficiency, reaching above 30 SEER.|$|E
50|$|According to {{observers}} <b>outside</b> <b>Unit</b> 4, burning {{lumps of}} material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor. Some of them fell onto {{the roof of the}} machine hall and started a fire. About 25 percent of the red-hot graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected. Parts of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building. As a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core. The air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite fire.|$|E
50|$|In the early-mid 20th-century Zardana's {{houses were}} {{constructed}} of mud brick and wood, {{unlike most of}} the villages in the vicinity.

During the French Mandate period, a resident of Zardana attacked a French military vehicle, prompting a French army operation to search for weapons being stored in the village. During the operation, {{the western part of}} the village was burned down and several men were detained. Most were pardoned upon the orders of an <b>outside</b> <b>unit</b> commander, but two residents were made to be executed by firing squad. One was killed, while the other was pardoned as a result of the intervention of an elder from nearby Saraqib.|$|E

40|$|In {{adaptive}} control of systems with poles {{close to the}} unit circle, application of the recursive estimation techniques can lead to excursions of the poles of the identified model outside the unit circle even when the process is open loop stable These excursions can be of two types. The poles of the deterministic component of the model can drift <b>outside</b> <b>unit</b> circle even when the process has no unstable modes. Alternatively, the poles and/or zeros of the unmeasured disturbance (noise) model can drift outside the unit circle In either case, the identified model is not suitable for on-line controller adaptation In this work, a novel constrained recursive formulation is proposed for on-line parameter estimation based on the pseudo-linear regression (PLR) approach. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated by conducting experimental studies on a benchmark laboratory scale heater-mixer setup The analysis of the open and closed loop experimental results reveals that the proposed constrained parameter estimation scheme provides a systematic and computationally attractive approach {{to ensure that the}} identified model parameters are restricted to the feasible region (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
