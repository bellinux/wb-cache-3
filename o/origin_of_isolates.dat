40|$|Summary This study {{investigated}} the possible phenotypic and genotypic similarities and differ-ences between Salmonella isolates obtained from swine with clinical salmonellosis to isolates obtained from swine showing no clinical disease. Phenotypic analysis was done by antimicrobial resistance profiling and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting was employed for genotypic analysis. A total of 281 (140 clinical and 141 non-clinical) were included in this study. There was no association between the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolates</b> (clinical or non-clinical) and the antimicrobial resistance profiles with OR of 0. 77 and 95 %CI (0. 46 - 1. 27). However, there was association between AFLP profile and <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolates</b> (distinct genotypic clustering) between Salmonella strains of clinical and non-clinical origin with an odds ratio of 8. 7 and 95 % CI (4. 8 - 15. 9). Therefore, we concluded that a high resolution DNA fingerprinting approach such as AFLP may be helpful in differentiating strains of primary clinical importance. Introduction The prevalence of Salmonella in today’s swine production systems {{continues to be a}} threat to the health of both swine and human consumers in the United States. With the emer-gence and persistence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) isolates in the last few decades, the threat has become even greater.

40|$|Thirty-eight {{isolates}} of Fusarium solani from {{potato tubers}} originated from Ardabil, Tehran and Hamadan Provinces of Iran, were grouped in 15 Vegetative Compatible Groups (VCGs) using nitrate non-utilising (nit) mutants. Within the 15 VCGs, seven groups contained one member {{and the other}} eight groups had at least two members each. To discover any possible relationship between the Iranian VCGs determined in this research and those from New Zealand, these mutants were paired with nit mutants of 22 isolates from five plant species in New Zealand. Therefore, out of 60 studied isolates 24 VCGs were identified. The results revealed high genetic divergence among isolates studied.

40|$|We used pulsed-field gel {{electrophoresis}} to study the epidemiology and population structure of Haemophilus influenzae type b. DNAs from 187 isolates recovered between 1985 and 1993 from Aboriginal children (n = 76), non-Aboriginal children (n = 106), and non-Aboriginal adults (n = 5) in urban and rural regions across Australia were digested with the SmaI restriction endonuclease. Patterns of 13 to 17 well-resolved fragments (size range, ∼ 8 to 500 kb) defining 67 {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) types were found. Two types predominated. One type (n = 37) accounted for 35 (46 %) of the isolates from Aboriginals and 2 (2 %) of the isolates from non-Aboriginals, and the other type (n = 41) accounted for 2 (3 %) of the isolates from Aboriginals and 39 (35 %) of the isolates from non-Aboriginals. Clustering revealed seven groups at a genetic distance of ∼ 50 % similarity in a tree-like dendrogram. They included two highly divergent groups representing 50 (66 %) isolates from Aboriginals and 6 (5 %) isolates from non-Aboriginals and another genetically distinct group representing 7 (9 %) isolates from Aboriginals and 81 (73 %) isolates from non-Aboriginals. The results showed a heterogeneous clonal population structure, with the isolates of two types accounting for 42 % of the sample. There was no association between RFLP type and the diagnosis of meningitis or epiglottitis, age, sex, date of collection, or geographic location, but there was a strong association between the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolates</b> from Aboriginal children and RFLP type F 2 a and the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolates</b> from non-Aboriginal children and RFLP type A 8 b.

40|$|A novel {{category}} of variable tandem repeats (VNTR) called mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRUs) {{has been identified}} for Mycobacterium ulcerans (n = 39), M. marinum (n = 27), and one related organism. Fifteen MIRU loci were identified in the genome of M. marinum and were used to genotype M. ulcerans, M. marinum, and an M. marinum-like organism that is considered a possible missing link between M. marinum and M. ulcerans. Seven MIRU loci were polymorphic, and locus-specific PCRs for four of these loci differentiated seven M. ulcerans genotypes, four M. marinum genotypes, and a unique genotype for the missing link organism. The seven M. ulcerans genotypes were related to six different geographic <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolates.</b> All isolates from West and Central Africa, including old and recent isolates, belonged to the same genotype, emphasizing the great spatiotemporal homogeneity among African isolates.

In the present work, we studied the relationship between mating type and invasiveness in A. fumigatus. Statistical analysis of the results showed a significant association between the mating type MAT 1 - 1 and an invasive origin of the isolates. Similarly, when the clinical or environmental <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolates</b> was considered instead of their invasive or non-invasive origin, a significant association between the mating type MAT 1 - 1 and clinical origin was observed.

40|$|Fusarium oxysporum is a main {{agriculture}} pathogen {{which is}} responsible for wilting in cucumber, muskmelon and watermelon. In order to study the genetic relationship and phylogeny of Fusarium oxysporum, 36 isolates were obtained from Liaoning province. The genetic relationship of Fusarium was determined by using EF- 1 α and β-tubulin DNA sequencing as well as a universally primed polymerase chain reaction (UP-PCR) analyses. The results show that all 36 isolates were identified as being infected with F. oxysporum by using the specific primers FOF 1 and FOR 1. Based on the combined sequence and UP-PCR data, the 36 isolates and GenBank isolates were classified into three major groups (Lineage 1 - 3). These groups corresponded with the three clades of F. oxysporum. Inspection of the sequence data revealed Lineage 1 and Lineage 2 had similar sequences whereas Lineage 3 was significantly different from the other two.

40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the ability of}} Candida albicans isolates to invade an in vitro oral tissue model. The extent and pattern of isolate invasion was then correlated with the infection origin of the isolate to identify characteristics that may be restricted to specific forms of oral infection, particularly chronic hyperplastic candidosis (CHC). Reconstituted human oral epithelium was infected with C. albicans isolated from normal oral mucosa (n = 4), CHC (n = 7), non-CHC oral candidoses (n = 4) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; n = 4). After infection for 24 h, histological analysis revealed yeast adhesion, hyphal extension, and invasion of the epithelium. Differential patterns of invasion were evident and, whilst consistent for a given isolate, did not relate to the infection origin of the isolate. Two principal patterns of invasion were evident and described as either a 'localised' or a 'uniform' distribution of invading hyphae. Several isolates also exhibited superficial infection with limited hyphal invasion. In conclusion, {{the use of the}} in vitro tissue model allowed the assessment of the invasive capabilities of isolates of C. albicans.

40|$|Botrytis cinerea, {{considered}} {{for a long time}} as a generalist fungal pathogen of a multitude of plants, was recently shown to exhibit significant population structure in France according to the host, suggesting sympatric specialization. Recent models also showed that adaptation to new hosts may facilitate the process of sympatric speciation in fungal plant pathogens. The present work aimed at investigating if host plants, combined with geographic origin and growing systems, shape the diversity and structure of Tunisian populations of B. cinerea. We genotyped 153 isolates with 9 microsatellites. In all the investigated populations, the fungus reproduced mainly sexually. Gene flow was significantly reduced between greenhouses and open fields from strawberry but not from grapevine. Populations from tomatoes, sampled under greenhouses only, exhibited a low genotypic diversity. The effects of plant and geography from open fields were investigated on a sample of 74 isolates.

40|$|Enhanced {{understanding}} of the transmission dynamics and population genetics for Plasmodium vivax is crucial in predicting the emergence and spread of novel parasite phenotypes with major public health implications, such as new relapsing patterns, drug resistance and increased virulence. Suitable molecular markers are required for these population genetic studies. Here, we focus on two groups of molecular markers that are commonly used to analyse natural populations of P. vivax. We use markers under selective pressure, for instance, antigen-coding polymorphic genes, and markers that are not under strong natural selection, such as most minisatellite and microsatellite loci. First, we review data obtained using genes encoding for P. vivax antigens: circumsporozoite protein, merozoite surface proteins 1 and 3 &# 945;, apical membrane antigen 1 and Duffy binding antigen.

Hair cells in the bullfrog sacculus, unlike those in the utriculus and semicircular canals, did not stain for N-acetylglucosamine (WGA) or N-acetylgalactosamine (VVA). By contrast, WGA and, to a lesser extent, VVA, differentially stained utricular and semicircular canal hair cells, labeling hair cells located in peripheral, but not central, regions. In mammals, WGA uniformly labeled Type 1 hair cells while labeling, as in the bullfrog, Type 2 hair cells only in peripheral regions.

The <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolates</b> was established by analysis of agr gene, identifying the agr groups. Results: Eleven (26. 7 %) workers were colonized with S. aureus. The frequency of S. aureus was higher in health care personnel who were in the operating room (20 %; OR = 2. 077; P> 0. 05). Four antibiotypes were identified, this feature is compatible with community clones that have proven to be highly diverse with a large capacity to spread in the community. 36. 4 % of the isolates were resistant to cefotaxime and/or oxacillin, suggestive mrsa phenotype in these isolated the mecA gene was identified. Agr i was found primarily among isolates metillicin-sensitive S. aureus (mssa), compatible with community origin, and mrsa isolates belong to agr ii, with hospital waste. Conclusion: The prevalence of S. aureus resistant to antibiotics that colonize health care personnel was demonstrated, mainly in those working in the operating room.

In contrast to porcine isolates, molecular epidemiological traits of avian E. rhusiopathiae isolates are less well known. Thus, we aimed to (i) develop a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for E. rhusiopathiae, (ii) study the congruence of strain grouping based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and MLST, (iii) determine the diversity of the dominant immunogenic protein SpaA, and (iv) examine the distribution of genes putatively linked with virulence among field isolates from poultry (120), swine (24) and other hosts (21), including humans (3). Using seven housekeeping genes for MLST analysis we determined 72 sequence types (STs) among 165 isolates. This indicated an overall high diversity, though 34. 5 % of all isolates belonged to a single predominant ST-complex, STC 9, which grouped strains from birds and mammals, including humans, together. PFGE revealed 58 different clusters and congruence with the sequence-based MLST-method was not common. Based on polymorphisms in the N-terminal hyper-variable region of SpaA the isolates were classified into five groups, which followed the phylogenetic background of the strains. More than 90 % of the isolates harboured all 16 putative virulence genes tested and only intI, encoding an internalin-like protein, showed infrequent distribution. MLST data determined E. rhusiopathiae as weakly clonal species with limited host specificity.

For this purpose, we analyzed global evolutionary relationships of LAM strains in a large dataset (n =  1923 isolates from 35 countries worldwide) with concomitant spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR data, followed by a deeper analysis of LAM 9 sublineage (n =  851 isolates). Based {{on a combination of}} phylogenetical analysis and Bayesian statistics, a total of three different clusters, tentatively named LAM 9 C 1, C 2 and C 3 were described in this dataset. Closer inspection of the phylogenetic tree with concomitant data on <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolates</b> with genetic clusterization revealed LAM 9 C 3 being the most tightly knit group exclusively found in the Old World as opposed to LAM 9 C 2 being a loosely-knit group without any phylogeographical specificity; while LAM 9 C 1 appeared with a majority of strains being well-clustered despite some isolates that intermixed with unrelated LAM clusters. Subsequently, we hereby describe a new M. tuberculosis LAM sublineage named LAM 9 C 3 with phylogeographical specificity for the Old World. These findings open new perspectives to study respective migration histories and adaptation to human hosts of specific M. tuberculosis clones during the exploration and conquest of the New World. We therefore plan to reevaluate the nomenclature and evolutionary history of various LAM sublineages using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) ...|$|E
40|$|Study of DNA {{fingerprinting}} of genomic DNA of Australian Ralstonia solanacearum biovar 3 {{was characterized}} by a DNA BOX primer that correspond with repetitive sequence using PCR amplification (rep-PCR). Based on rep-PCR DNA profiles different band mobility were observed among Australian biovar 3. Most <b>of</b> <b>isolates</b> have shown common DNA amplification product at 600 bp. Cluster analysis to the DNA profiles showed two different DNA banding patterns that correlated with geographical <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> the <b>isolates.</b> Subgroup A correspond well with isolates from South Queensland/New South Wales, whilst subgroup B correspond with isolates from North Queensland origin. Key words: Ralstonia solanacearum, rep-PCR, marke...|$|R
40|$|Restriction {{fragment}} length polymorphism (RFLP) {{was used}} for the differentiation of 80 Coxiella burnetii isolates derived from animals and humans in Europe, USA, Africa and Asia. After NotI restriction of total C. burnetii DNA and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) 20 different restriction patterns were distinguished. The index of discrimination for this typing system was 0. 86. Comparison and phylogenetic analysis of the different RFLP patterns revealed evolutionary relationships among groups that corresponded to the geographical <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the <b>isolates.</b> This finding was confirmed by genetic mapping. No correlation between restriction group and virulence <b>of</b> <b>isolates</b> was detected...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the application of}} stable isotope analysis of proboscidean remains (collagen in bone/dentin/cementum and structural carbonate in enamel bioapatite) for genus-level identification <b>of</b> <b>isolated</b> specimens, assessment <b>of</b> geographic <b>origins,</b> and testing for nutritional stress. Mammoths (Mammuthus sp.) tended to have higher δ 15 Ncol and lower δ 13 Ccol than mastodons (Mammut americanum), but differences were not significant in every location. Determining the genus <b>of</b> <b>isolated</b> specimens may be possible for locations and time periods with good isotopic baselines, but environmental changes can confound interpretations. For example, an Alberta proboscidean with a δ 15 Ncol of + 1. 4 ‰ (characteristic of mastodons) ultimately {{proved to be a}} mammoth. Its surprisingly low nitrogen isotope composition is attributable to the recently deglaciated environment it inhabited. We provided a baseline for isotopic assessment <b>of</b> geographic <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolated</b> proboscideans in Western Canada. Bioapatite δ 13 Csc and δ 18 Osc can be used to distinguish specimens from Alberta, Klondike, Old Crow, Herschel Island, and further south (e. g., Arizona, Great Lakes). Finally, we found that an Alberta mammoth with morphological evidence of nutritional stress experienced a change in diet, environment, or physiology prior to death, but its isotopic compositions did not suggest a link to hypothesized starvation (catabolism of proteins or reliance on lipids) ...|$|R
