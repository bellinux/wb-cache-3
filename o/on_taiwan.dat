5|$|The Dutch period {{ended in}} 1662 when Ming loyalist forces of Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga) drove out the Dutch and {{established}} the short-lived Zheng family kingdom <b>on</b> <b>Taiwan.</b> The Zhengs brought 70,000 soldiers to Taiwan and immediately began clearing {{large tracts of}} land to support its forces. Despite the preoccupation with fighting the Qing, the Zheng family was concerned with aboriginal welfare <b>on</b> <b>Taiwan.</b> The Zhengs built alliances, collected taxes and erected aboriginal schools, where Taiwan's aborigines were first introduced to the Confucian Classics and Chinese writing. However, {{the impact of the}} Dutch was deeply ingrained in aboriginal society. In the 19th and 20th centuries, European explorers wrote of being welcomed as kin by the aborigines who thought they were the Dutch, who had promised to return.|$|E
5|$|The typhoon claimed 13lives in Taiwan. Around 2million {{people lost}} power {{due to the}} storm while greater than 20houses were destroyed. Over 59,895 ha (148,000acres) of crops were damaged. Monetary damage totaled $81million. In {{addition}} to effects <b>on</b> <b>Taiwan,</b> the extratropical remnants later brought heavy rains to Japan.|$|E
5|$|After the Qing {{government}} {{defeated the}} Ming loyalist forces {{maintained by the}} Zheng family in 1683, parts of Taiwan became increasingly integrated into the Qing Empire. Qing forces ruled areas of Taiwan's highly populated western plain for over two centuries, until 1895. This era was characterized by a marked {{increase in the number}} of Han Chinese <b>on</b> <b>Taiwan,</b> continued social unrest, the piecemeal transfer (by various means) of large amounts of land from the aborigines to the Han, and the nearly complete acculturation of the Western Plains Aborigines to Taiwanese Han customs.|$|E

5|$|Japanese ethnographer Ino Kanori {{was charged}} {{with the task of}} {{surveying}} the entire population of Taiwanese aborigines, applying the first systematic study of aborigines <b>on</b> <b>Taiwan.</b> Ino's research {{is best known for his}} formalization of eight peoples of Taiwanese aborigines: Atayal, Bunun, Saisiat, Tsou, Paiwan, Puyuma, Ami and Pepo (Pingpu). This is the direct antecedent of the taxonomy used today to distinguish people groups that are officially recognized by the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} for indigenous {{cultural and political}} resurgence in Taiwan traces its roots to the ideals outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Although the Republic of China was a UN member and signatory to the original UN Charter, four decades of martial law controlled the discourse of culture and politics <b>on</b> <b>Taiwan.</b> The political liberalization Taiwan experienced {{leading up to the}} official end of martial law on July 15, 1987, opened a new public arena for dissenting voices and political movements against the centralized policy of the KMT.|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} Okinawa, Sinlaku threatened northern Taiwan, {{which was}} previously affected by two deadly typhoons {{in the previous}} year. Officials enacted many preparations, although damage ended up being minimal on the island. Two people were killed <b>on</b> <b>Taiwan,</b> however. Sinlaku weakened slightly before making its final landfall in eastern China near Wenzhou on September7. There, the storm produced a record wind gust of 204km/h (127mph), and {{just south of the}} city, high waves destroyed several piers and a large boat. High rainfall and winds from Sinlaku destroyed 58,000houses, and large areas of crops were destroyed. Damage in China was estimated at $709million, and there were 28deaths there.|$|E

5|$|In July 1950, {{soon after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 Superfortress bombers to Guam as a deterrent to a Chinese attack <b>on</b> <b>Taiwan,</b> and possible future use in Korea. They were loaded with Mark 4 nuclear bombs, but without the fissile cores. Travis was one of twenty passengers and crewmen on board B-29 Superfortress 44-87651 when it commenced take off from Fairfield-Suisun at 2200 on 5 August 1950. The plane was piloted by Captain Eugene Q. Steffes, with First Lieutenant Carter W. Johnson as his co-pilot and Technical Sergeant Donald W. Moore as his flight engineer.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of China, {{which then}} governed the mainland, {{had joined the}} Olympic {{movement}} in 1924, when the China National Amateur Athletic Federation was recognized by the IOC as the nation's NOC. China participated in the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles, {{as well as in}} Berlin four years later and the first post-war Olympics at London in 1948. When the communists were successful in the Chinese Civil War and established the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, most NOC members fled the mainland for the island of Taiwan. This left China with two rival NOCs, one on the mainland and one <b>on</b> <b>Taiwan,</b> each claiming to represent the whole of China.|$|E
5|$|The {{complexity}} {{and scope of}} aboriginal assimilation and acculturation <b>on</b> <b>Taiwan</b> has led to three general narratives of Taiwanese ethnic change. The oldest holds that Han migration from Fujian and Guangdong in the 17th century pushed the Plains Aborigines into the mountains, where they became the Highland peoples of today. A more recent view asserts that through widespread intermarriage between Han and aborigines between the 17th and 19th centuries, the aborigines were completely Sinicized. Finally, modern ethnographical and anthropological studies have shown a pattern of cultural shift mutually experienced by both Han and Plains Aborigines, resulting in a hybrid culture. Today people who comprise Taiwan's ethnic Han demonstrate major cultural differences from Han elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|General Marshall was Truman's {{principal}} adviser {{on foreign policy}} matters, influencing such decisions as the U.S. choice against offering direct military aid to Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalist Chinese forces in the Chinese Civil War against their communist opponents. Marshall's opinion was contrary to the counsel of almost all of Truman's other advisers—Marshall thought propping up Chiang's forces would drain U.S. resources that were needed in Europe to deter the Soviets. When the communists {{took control of the}} mainland, establishing the People's Republic of China and driving the Nationalists to Taiwan, Truman would have been willing to maintain some relationship between the U.S. and the new government but Mao was unwilling. On June 27, 1950, after the outbreak of fighting in Korea, Truman ordered the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent further conflict between the communist government on the China mainland and the Republic of China (ROC) <b>on</b> <b>Taiwan.</b>|$|E

In 1841 during the First Opium War in the Battle of Keelung (1841-1842) the British attempted to attack in failed efforts three times against Keelung {{on the northeast}} coast of Taiwan under Qing rule. The ventures to seize Da'an and Keelung by the British failed. The successful defense was directed by Yao Ying who led the Chinese naval forces <b>on</b> <b>Taiwan.</b> <b>On</b> <b>Taiwan</b> some British were taken as prisoners by the taotai Yao Ying and interrogated {{for information on the}} west. Indian and European crew members of the Nerbudda, a British ship, were captured <b>on</b> <b>Taiwan</b> after being abandoned by their British officers and were executed by local Qing officials. Portuguese, Indian, American, and European crew members of the Ann, another British ship, were shipwrecked in Tamsui's vicinity in March 1842, captured, and then executed by the Chinese.
