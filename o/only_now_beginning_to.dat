500|$|Several {{critics have}} {{advocated}} for a reassessment of Hope's career. One is Chuck Berg, writing for Down Beat in 1980, who attributed the ignoring of Hope by most jazz fans and critics {{largely to the}} uniqueness of his style, which differed from that prevalent in jazz generally and in bebop in particular. Berg contrasted the [...] "aggressive assertiveness, massive outpourings of raw energy and displays of technical athleticism" [...] that, he argued, are valued in jazz, with Hope's more nuanced and intellectual approach, and suggested that the expansion of what is accepted in jazz since his death meant that his career should be re-evaluated. Seven years later, Palmer wrote on Hope and fellow pianist Herbie Nichols: [...] "they were practically categorized out of existence. Dismissed as second-stringers and copyists {{when they were both}} prolifically creative and highly original, they suffered a neglect that is <b>only</b> <b>now</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> be dispelled in the case of Nichols, and that still continues in the case of Hope."

60|$|Or, {{to take a}} case which affords {{a closer}} {{parallel}} with that of medicine. Agriculture has been cultivated from the earliest times, and, from a remote antiquity, men have attained considerable practical skill in the cultivation of the useful plants, and have empirically established many scientific truths concerning {{the conditions under which}} they flourish. But, it is within the memory of many of us, that chemistry on the one hand, and vegetable physiology on the other, attained a stage of development such {{that they were able to}} furnish a sound basis for scientific agriculture. Similarly, medicine took its rise in the practical needs of mankind. At first, studied without reference to any other branch of knowledge, it long maintained, indeed still to some extent maintains, that independence. Historically, its connection with the biological sciences has been slowly established, and the full extent and intimacy of that connection are <b>only</b> <b>now</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> be apparent. I trust I have not been mistaken in supposing that an attempt to give a brief sketch of the steps by which a philosophical necessity has become an historical reality, may not be devoid of interest, possibly of instruction, to the members of this great Congress, profoundly interested as all are in the scientific development of medicine.|$|E
60|$|If we may {{trust his}} own report, Henry James {{had reached the}} age of {{seventeen}} with a curiously vague understanding of his own talent. No doubt it is possible to read the 'Notes' too literally; and indeed I have the fortunate opportunity of giving a side-light upon this period of his youth which proves as much. But if he was not quite the indeterminate brooder he depicts, he was far from rivalling the unusual precocity and decision of his brothers, and he was <b>only</b> <b>now</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> take real stock of his gifts. He had been provided with almost none of the sort of training by which he might have profited; and it is not to be supposed that his always indulgent parent would have neglected the taste of a literary son if it had shewn itself distinctly. He had been left to discover his line of progress as best he might, and his advance towards literature was slow and shy. Yet it would seem that by this time he must have made up his mind more definitely than he suggests in recalling the Newport years. The side-light I mentioned is thrown by some interesting notes sent me by Mr. Thomas Sergeant Perry, who made the acquaintance of the family at Newport and was to remain their lifelong friend. His description shews that Henry James had now his own ambitions, even if he preferred to nurse them unobtrusively.|$|E
60|$|THERE is a {{difference}} between religion and the amazing circumstructure which, under the name of theology, the priesthoods have builded round about it, which for centuries they made the world believe was the true temple, and which, after incalculable mischiefs wrought, immeasurable blood spilled in its extension and consolidation, is <b>only</b> <b>now</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> crumble at the touch of reason.

It is unquestionable authority for setting aside any statute that any legislative body ever passed or can pass. In it are dictates of recognized validity for turning topsy-turvy every principle of justice and reversing every decree of reason. There is no fallacy so monstrous, no deduction so hideously unrelated to common sense, as not to receive, somewhere in the myriad pages of this awful compilation, a support that any judge in the land would be proud to recognize with a decision if ably persuaded. I do not say that the lawyers are altogether responsible for the existence of this mass of disastrous rubbish, nor for its domination of the laws. They only create and thrust it down our throats; we are guilty of contributory negligence in not biting the spoon.|$|E
40|$|The CRH {{receptor}} (CRH-R) is {{a member}} of the secretin family of G protein-coupled receptors. Wide expression of CRH-Rs in the central nervous system and periphery ensures that their cognate agonists, the family of CRH-like peptides, are capable of exerting a wide spectrum of actions that underpin their critical role in integrating the stress response and coordinating the activity of fundamental physiological functions, such as the regulation of the cardiovascular system, energy balance, and homeostasis. Two types of mammal CRH-R exist, CRH-R 1 and CRH-R 2, each with unique splicing patterns and remarkably distinct pharmacological properties, but similar signaling properties, probably reflecting their distinct and sometimes contrasting biological functions.

60|$|Such are {{the various}} classes of {{evidence}} that bear directly {{on the question of}} the distribution of organisms; but there are others of even a more fundamental character, and the importance of which is <b>only</b> <b>now</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> be recognised by students of nature. These are, firstly, the wonderful alterations of climate which have occurred in the temperate and polar zones, as proved by the evidences of glaciation in the one and of luxuriant vegetation in the other; and, secondly, the theory of the permanence of existing continents and oceans. If glacial epochs in temperate lands and mild climates near the poles have, as now believed by men of eminence, occurred several times over in the past history of the earth, the effects of such great and repeated changes, both on the migration, modification, and extinction, of species, must have been of overwhelming importance--of more importance perhaps than even the geological changes of sea and land. It is therefore necessary to consider the evidence for these climatal changes; {10} and then, by a critical examination of their possible causes, to ascertain whether they were isolated phenomena, were due to recurrent cosmical actions, or were the result of a great system of terrestrial development. The latter is the conclusion we arrive at; and this conclusion brings with it the conviction, that in the theory which accounts for both glacial epochs and warm polar climates, we have the key to explain and harmonize many of the most anomalous biological and geological phenomena, and one which is especially valuable for the light it throws on the dispersal and existing distribution of organisms. The other important theory, or rather corollary from the preceding theory--that of the permanence of oceans and the general stability of continents throughout all geological time, is as yet very imperfectly understood, and seems, in fact, to many persons in the nature of a paradox. The evidence for it, however, appears to me to be conclusive; and it is certainly the most fundamental question in regard to the subject we have to deal with: since, if we once admit that continents and oceans may have changed places over and over again (as many writers maintain), we lose all power of reasoning on the migrations of ancestral forms of life, and are at the mercy of every wild theorist who chooses to imagine the former existence of a now-submerged continent to explain the existing distribution of a group of frogs or a genus of beetles.|$|E
