Meanwhile, Sarah Jane and Rose, now getting on better than at their first meeting, try to unlock the programming on the school's computers; Mickey and K9 remain in Sarah Jane's car for surveillance. With the Doctor's help, they discover that the computers— bolstered by the students' enhanced intelligence— are part of a Krillitane effort to solve the [...] "Skasis Paradigm", a theory of everything. As the paradigm is nearly solved, which would allow the Krillitanes full control over time and space, they seal the school. Mr. Finch propositions the Doctor a second time, tempting him with the ability to save the Time Lords and override human mortality. With Sarah Jane's counseling, the Doctor refuses, and they run from Mr. Finch. After Kenny (a student who had not eaten the chips) alerts Mickey to the students' plight, Mickey crashes Sarah Jane's car through the school's doors and unplugs the computers, allowing the children to flee. The Doctor leads the Krillitanes to the kitchen. [...] Upon their arrival, K9 detonates the chip <b>oil</b> <b>container,</b> saturating the Krillitanes.

Later the system was tested with a Sisu K-141 4×2 together with a field cannon 130 K 54 and Vanaja KK-69 ET 6×6 coupled with a three-axle carriage powered by a separate aggregate-run pump. The test proved even these trucks, not designed for off-road use, could haul heavy cannons in rough terrain using the Nemo system.

50|$|While Tarak has had {{six months}} of {{peaceful}} leadership, {{a couple of his}} old rivals, Dhanna Lal and Zamir are back in action. Zamir is now a member of a city-based troop led by their leader named Vasu. With his food-finding abilities, Zamir leads a few members to a government office where Sher Singh is in charge. As soon as Sher Singh leaves the office unguarded, Zamir sends in minor members in search of food and later enters himself. Although they find no food, many confidential public tax-related government documents are thrown out open in the streets. This incident attracts Dhanna Lal to the site, setting up cages near the office. Dhanna Lal is back and now has his own supporting team consisting of his family members. The team does a long wait but sees no monkey to be trapped. Meanwhile, at 'Help In Suffering', Suresh Valmiki makes another attempt to reunite Kavi {{with the rest of the}} gang, having already fail in an earlier try. Kavi is left out in a cage where Bipin and many others try to investigate the familiar face. After spending some time, Kavi finally loses its fear and is set free by Suresh. By the time Suresh bids its farewell, it quickly runs away somewhere unseen between the streets. Some of the gang members try to chase him but it is too fast to be caught. It remains unknown why Kavi had to run away. In the other part of the city, Dhanna Lal is desperate to catch the infamous Zamir, one of his oldest targets. Dhanna's search for him leads to the city's grain market, where Vasu, Zamir and rest of the troop are set with a big plan in their minds. On spotting the macaques, the monkey catching team is set in action and cages are set up high on the roofs of the market. One of the members of the team hides near a cage in an <b>oil</b> <b>container.</b> Zamir precisely knows the plans of the team and cleverly decides to stay away from the traps. Yet Vasu and his troop aren't clever as Zamir is. Vasu and some of the powerful males of his troop are caught in a trap, leaving Zamir's troop without an alpha male. Vasu, just like it happened with some of the Galta Gang members, is taken far away from the city of Jaipur and left in exile in a forest.|$|E

40|$|This thesis´s aim is {{the design}} of an {{attitude}} control subsystem of an autonomous explorer submarine. This submarine has three attitude subsystems; thruster system for propulsion, ballast system for heave motion and the object of this thesis, the pendulum system for the pitch angle. The pitch angle control is managed by varying {{the position of the}} center of gravity of the submarine relatively from the buoyancy point. To do that, the system moves the batteries of the submarine. At the beginning of this thesis there were already some researches done about the batteries configuration and the motion system. A planetary gearbox outside the motion area of the pendulum and a stepper motor were considered to rotate the batteries and the <b>oil</b> <b>container</b> as a whole. After considering different layouts and their interactions with the other devices inside the submarine, the planetary gearbox and the movement of the <b>oil</b> <b>container</b> have been discarded. A stepper motor, located besides the batteries and rotating with them, moves the mechanism through a gearbox based on a worm-spur gear scheme. This gearbox provides a reduction of 180 : 1 and self-locking behavior, which means that no energy is needed to keeping a reached pendulum position. Due to the efficiently space use, it has been possible to increase the size of the batteries to add weight to the pendulum and increase the capacity, instead of 16. 000 mAh now the capacity of each battery is 20. 000 mAh. The pendulum system is able to rotate 90 ° in 6. 35 seconds and done simulations show that for a 20 ° target rotation the submarine will reach a stable equilibrium position in less than 30 seconds...|$|E
