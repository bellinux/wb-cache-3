5|$|At the airport, Cole {{leaves a}} last message telling the {{scientists}} that in following the Army of the Twelve Monkeys they are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>track,</b> {{and that he}} will not return. He is soon confronted by Jose, an acquaintance from his own time, who gives Cole a handgun and ambiguously instructs him to follow orders. At the same time, Railly spots Dr. Peters, and recognizes him from a newspaper photograph as an assistant at Goines' father's virology lab. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that match the locations and sequence of the viral outbreaks.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, Lau made a guest {{appearance}} {{in one of}} Susanna Kwan's music video and {{caught the eye of}} the manager Teddy Robin. Teddy Robin then gave Lau a chance to play a small role in the movie Once Upon a Rainbow. This was the first step in Lau's film acting career. He was then given a role in Ann Hui's 1982 film, Boat People. Later in 1983 he had his first leading role in a Shaw Brothers film called <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wrong</b> <b>Track.</b>|$|E

50|$|Zachs {{discovers that}} they are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>tracks</b> and <b>on</b> a {{collision}} course with a Southern Pacific freight train hauling gasoline tank cars. Since the trains are in dark territory, it was impossible for the train dispatchers to communicate with the trains' engineers to stop the trains to avoid collision. Casey kills the mercenaries one by one and releases the hostages, but Dane uses his computer skills to locate the stealth bombers and re-targets Grazer to knock them out before they can complete their mission. Meanwhile, Penn had previously captured Sarah and uses her as bait for Casey. Casey confronts Penn and breaks his neck after a fight that spills into the kitchen.|$|R

25|$|Throughout Dijkstra's career, {{his work}} was {{characterized}} by elegance and economy. A prolific writer (especially as an essayist), Dijkstra authored more than 1,300 papers, many written by hand in his precise script. They were essays and parables; fairy tales and warnings; comprehensive explanation and pedagogical pretext. Most were about mathematics and computer science; others were trip reports that are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited. It was his habit to copy each paper and circulate it to {{a small group of}} colleagues who would copy and forward the papers to another limited group of scientists. His love affair with simplicity came at an early age and under his mother's guidance. He once said he had asked his mother whether trigonometry was a difficult topic. She replied that he must learn all the formulas and that furthermore if he required more than five lines to prove something, he was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... interpretive {{schemes that}} {{dominated}} Canadian historical writing {{through the middle}} {{decades of the twentieth}} century were built on the assumption that history had a discernible direction and flow. Canada was moving towards a goal in the nineteenth century; whether this endpoint was the construction of a transcontinental, commercial, and political union, the development of parliamentary government, or the preservation and resurrection of French Canada, it was certainly a Good Thing. Thus the rebels of 1837 were quite literally <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>track.</b> They lost because they had to lose; they were not simply overwhelmed by superior force, they were justly chastised by the God of History.|$|E

40|$|The article {{looks into}} the {{emergence}} and the developments of a new approach in research that {{is interested in the}} sequences, continuities and discontinuities in the landscapes of attentiveness in public communication. This interest in research stems from the old problem of explanations for the discontinuing social changes in modern society, marked by disaster and upheaval. At the University of Zurich this has fallen within the responsibility of the research department Public and Society since 1997 (FÖG – Forschungsbereich Öffentlichkeit und Gesellschaft). The realization of the beginnings and conclusions sheds a light <b>on</b> <b>the</b> contingencies, as well as <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>tracks</b> and self-convincing mechanisms inherent in any research. In addition, this retrospective serves to recall the benefit of the capture of ever changing landscapes of attentiveness in and after 2008. Finally, there is also a benefit in the sociology of knowledge: research depends on context in which the fragile tissue of ideas and attempts is woven. This is ignored by academic culture, which focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> creative author. Initially, we see that new approaches in research start irritation. Irritation is the mother of all knowledge and has the remarkable quality of stimulating exchange between researchers of different disciplines. Naturally, this at first increases irritation. Then, irritation enforces rereading of the classics and leads to a meandering path from which – in time – the contours of a new approach in research become visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> horizon. Only then does work with the methodical tools of <b>the</b> trade <b>on</b> these contours begin and, maybe, constitute an approach in research that proves valid. In any case, it will give birth to new problems and irritations. Accordingly, this realization leads to the issue of the adequacy of the new approach in research with regard to the old and newly found questions concerning the causes and consequences of the latest dramatic structural change of the public and of the changes in quality in media-based communication...|$|R
50|$|The track {{began to}} dry and {{everyone}} pitted for dry tyres. Lehto was fifth, having started from the pit lane, but he retired with handling problems on lap 14. Berger took the place but he too retired with suspension problems six laps later. It rained {{again and the}} leaders now pitted for wets. Schumacher stayed out and was leading but spun off on lap 23 because he was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> tyres. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> began to dry and everyone pitted once again with Senna having a problem and losing 20 seconds. Prost now led Senna, Hill, Rubens Barrichello, Derek Warwick and Herbert.|$|R

6000|$|If you {{get into}} {{conversation}} with a stranger in Honolulu, and experience that natural desire to know what sort of ground you are treading on by finding out what manner of man your stranger is, strike out boldly and address him as [...] "Captain." [...] Watch him narrowly, and if you see by his countenance that you are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>track,</b> ask him where he preaches. It is {{a safe bet that}} he is either a missionary or captain of a whaler. I became personally acquainted with seventy-two captains and ninety-six missionaries. The captains and ministers form one-half of the population; the third fourth is composed of common Kanakas and mercantile foreigners and their families; and the final fourth is made up of high officers of the Hawaiian Government. And there are just about cats enough for three apiece all around.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lower track}} is blocked. A train going {{from left to}} right cannot use the regular track. It must use <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> exit-signal of the left station shows Hp0 (one or two red lights: [...] "Stop"), because there is no regular route to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> signal shows also Zs8 (three white {{flashing}} lights: [...] "Proceed <b>on</b> <b>wrong</b> track"). <b>The</b> signal cannot show Sh1 ("Shunting allowed") in this case, because the ride would end at the Ra10-plate ("Stop for shunting movements"). When approaching the next station, the train will find an Ne2-plate, which substitiutes a distant signal and in this case means [...] "Expect Stop". At the position of the entry-signal of the right station, a Ne4 plate shows that a signal is not where it is expected. Instead, the signal is mounted right of the track. This signal shows Sh1 (two white lights: [...] "Shunting allowed"), the train may enter the station. The signal could also stand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left side of the track, the Ne4 plate is not used then.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{indicated}} that the accident was caused by one train leaving a station without permission. Court proceedings before Amtsgericht Meißen confirmed that the scheduled train No. 3011, hauled by engine 99 1789, had left Friedewald Bad without permission despite <b>the</b> other train <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line. In addition, the train crew had failed to stop at a signalling board (an [...] "Ne 1" [...] trapezoid board) and used <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>track</b> in Friedewald Bad.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>tracks</b> {{of forming}} {{economic}} coordination {{and the ones}} considered as fortunate all suggest that different rationality types (full of conflicts) inevitably show themselves.

It is also certain that these changes cannot be overcome by economic policy through definition inventions. But neither its ability to adjust can be doubted...|$|R
