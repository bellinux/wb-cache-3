40|$|How is it {{that people}} manage to live side by side without incessant 2 ̆ 2 warre of every man against every man 2 ̆ 2 ? Thomas Hobbes, who won fame for posing this question, {{concluded}} that the legal system-the rules and might of Leviathan-is the wellspring of social order. Most law professors implicitly propagate this Hobbesian view, perhaps because it lends significance to what they teach. Law-and-economics scholars have been particularly prone to assert the centrality of legal doctrine. There is an opposing intellectual tradition, however, that emphasizes that social order can emerge without law. Its core theorists have been empirical sociologists and anthropologists who study stateless societies. Within the legal academy the law professors associated with the law-and-society movement have been the prime skeptics {{of the importance of}} law. A field study that I recently conducted in Shasta County, California, provides an empirical perspective on the sources of social order. The study investigated how rural residents resolve disputes arising over damage done by stray livestock. Much of the Shasta County evidence casts doubt on the Hobbesian view. In areas of Shasta County that are legally designated as 2 ̆ 2 closed range, 2 ̆ 2 a victim of cattle trespass is legally entitled to recover damages from the livestock owner on a strict-liability basis. In 2 ̆ 2 open-range 2 ̆ 2 areas, by contrast, a victim of trespass across an unfenced boundary has no rights to legal redress. I found that the rural residents of Shasta County (and even the insurance adjusters who settle minor trespass claims) pay almost no heed to these legal rules. The <b>operative</b> <b>rule</b> in both open- and closed-range areas is an informal norm that the owner of livestock is responsible for the conduct of his animals.

We used fMRI to investigate these limits {{in a series of}} multirule tasks involving different stimuli, rules, and response keys. Data were analyzed both during presentation of instructions and during later task execution. Between tasks, we manipulated the number of rules specified in task instructions, and within tasks, we manipulated the number of <b>rules</b> <b>operative</b> in each trial block. Replicating previous results, rule failures were strongly predicted by fluid intelligence and increased with the number of <b>operative</b> <b>rules.</b> In fMRI data, analyses of the instruction period showed that the bilateral inferior frontal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, and presupplementary motor area were phasically active with presentation of each new rule. In a broader range of frontal and parietal regions, baseline activity gradually increased as successive rules were instructed. During task performance, we observed contrasting fronto-parietal patterns of sustained (block-related) and transient (trial-related) activity. Block, but not trial, activity showed effects of task complexity. We suggest that, as a new task is learned, a fronto-parietal representation of relevant rules and facts is assembled for future control of behavior. Capacity limits in learning and executing new rules, and their association with fluid intelligence, may be mediated by this load-sensitive fronto-parietal network...|$|R

40|$|Rivers’ {{potential}} for satisfying growing water demands has always fascinated human beings. The current {{idea that a}} river’s natural flow should be reserved to conserve pristine dynamics is a utopian ideal, at least in countries having established {{a certain level of}} progress.

The case study is a 112 km long reach of the Po river in Italy, from Piacenza to Boretto. The Isola Serafini (IS) gate serves a large run-of-the-river hydroelectricity plant since 1962. The dam blocks a relevant amount of sediments and is cause, together with intense sand mining, for the river bed incision immediately downstream that has made several navigation and irrigation devices unusable during low flow periods, leading to expensive and recurrent works to restore their functionality.

An exploration of problems of optimal management of such green urban spaces and the related biogeochemical fluxes is presented, extending probabilistic ecohydrological models of the soil-plant system to the urban context, where biophysical and ecological conditions tend to be radically different from the surrounding rural and natural environment (e. g. heat islands, air and water pollution, low quality soils, etc).

We reviewed our experience in 622 patients, who underwent thyroid operation from January 2000 to September 2007. Among these ones, 76 were the patients who underwent reoperative thyroid surgery. Prior surgery in the 76 reoperations was: nucleo-resection in 9 pts (12. 9 %), lobectomy in 43 pts (55. 5 %), lobectomy+isthmectomy in 7 pts (9. 3 %), subtotal thyroidectomy in 17 pts (22. 2 %). Histologic examination revealed: benign lesions in 67 pts (88. 15 %), papillary cancer in 4 pts (5. 26 %), follicular cancer in 2 pts (2. 63 %), follicular adenoma in 1 pt (1. 32 %) and Hashimoto thyroiditis in 2 pts (2. 63 %).

40|$|Background Surgical {{approaches}} to the jugular foramen are often complex and lengthy procedures associated with significant morbidity based on the anatomic and tumor characteristics. In addition {{to the risk of}} intra-operative hemorrhage from vascular tumors, lower cranial nerves deficits are frequently increased after intra-operative manipulation. Accordingly, modifications in the surgical techniques have been developed to minimize these risks. Preoperative embolization and intra-operative ligation of the external carotid artery have decreased the intraoperative blood loss. Accurate identification and exposure of the cranial nerves extracranially allows for their preservation during tumor resection. The modification of facial nerve mobilization provides widened infratemporal exposure with less postoperative facial weakness. The ideal approach should enable complete, one stage tumor resection with excellent infratemporal and posterior fossa exposure and would not aggravate or cause neurologic deficit. The aim {{of this study is to}} present our experience in handling jugular foramen lesions (mainly glomus jugulare) without the need for anterior facial nerve transposition. Methods In this series we present our experience in Kasr ElEini University hospital (Cairo–-Egypt) in handling 36 patients with jugular foramen lesions over a period of 20 years where the previously mentioned preoperative and <b>operative</b> <b>rules</b> were followed. The clinical status, operative technique and postoperative care and outcome are detailed and analyzed in relation to the outcome. Results Complete cure without complications was achieved in four cases of congenital cholesteatoma and four cases with class B glomus. In advanced cases of glomus jugulare (28 patients) (C and D stages) complete cure was achieved in 21 of them (75 %). The operative complications were also related to this group of 28 patients, in the form of facial paralysis in 20 of them (55. 6 %) and symptomatic vagal paralysis in 18 of them (50 %). Conclusions Total anterior rerouting of the facial nerve carries a high risk of facial paralysis. So it should be reserved for cases where the lesion extends beyond the vertical ICA.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the issue of}} dichotomous growth and {{development}} is addressed by means of computer simulation. As previously remarked by many authors (see for example Marengo and Willinger [5], or McCain [6]), computer simulation is a key technique to model economic dynamics. The specific application of this study comes out from considerations related {{to the field of}} evolutionary economics. At the first corner of the ring we find the intuition of Kirman [2] which emphasises the importance of viewing to economy as an evolving network. In this context interaction is viewed as a leading aspect in modern economy, where individual behaviour arises as a synthesis of both previous personal experience and partnership effects. Although many different paths may be followed to approach this topic, this paper addresses to the specific field of simulations of interaction among individuals by means of spatial connections. In particular, we explore the emergence of dichotomous growth, when the spatial distribution is simulated through of connectivity structures well-known to topology representation theory and strictly related to the approach of self-organisation in neural models [3], [4]. The simulations have been performed starting from the two sector growth model suggested in McCain [6] with a few modification. As in McCain [6], we consider an overlapping generation system, where each individual lives for two periods. At each step the agent chooses how to allocate potential labour between work and study, and hence how to divide wages between consumption and savings which will be invested in physical capital {{to be used in the}} second part of his life. The production function for tangible goods is given by a Cobb-Douglas function: Q=(L K H) ^ 1 / 3 Where, Q,L,K, and H are, respectively, production, labour services, tangible and human capital. New generations acquire from the old one previous situation with changes induced by learning and neighbourhood effects. Our efforts have been concentrated in the task of modelling such learning and neighbourhood effects. Our contribution stands primarily in the fact that in our model spatial connections affect not only the level of human capital available (and hence production), but also propensity to save as well as propensity to study. The following rules have been adopted: - at each step, two leaders (cell) of the process emerge as individuals who have shown, respectively, better rate of production and allocation of wages. Hence each cell will set its <b>operative</b> <b>rules</b> and modify previous strategy by taking into account emerging leaders of the step as well as spatial distance from them according to a smoothing function as the one below: f [(i,j), l, csi,] = Exp[-csi d(l,(i,j)) ] where (ij) is the position of individual in the grid, l is the position of leader, csi is a positive constant arbitrarily chosen in (0, 1), and finally d(l,(i,j)) is a proper metrics which computes the distance between the leader and the cell under examination. -The leaders in turn will change their previous rules by perturbing them by a random factor. The model is studied by adopting both a classical cross neighbourhood with various radius amplitudes and various clique typologies [1]. All the simulations have been implemented using Wolfram's Mathematica. ...|$|R

40|$|In American {{constitutional}} law, {{the existence}} of a constitutional text appears essential for the derivation of judicial review. This textual derivation is considered either direct because the founders 2 ̆ 7 expectation of judicial review is explicitly inscribed in the Constitution, or indirect because the written character of the document itself implicitly establishes the text as a 2 ̆ 2 law 2 ̆ 2 that judges are both qualified and obliged to enforce against the other branches of government. 2 ̆ 7 In either case, the textuality of the Constitution is the key for the conventional justifications of American judicial review.

Following Thomas Jefferson 2 ̆ 7 s dictum that each generation should compose its own constitutional regime-and his calculation that for this purpose a generation was thirty-four years 2 -we might say that the second generation of Israeli judges has cautiously moved toward inventing a practice of judicial review. The contemporary Justices of the Israeli Supreme Court have not openly announced a new rule justifying judicial review; but, in the time-honored fashion of common law judges, their practices are increasingly in tension with the old rule. A new rule for judicial review might therefore emerge from these practices...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that recent influential contributions to monetary policy imply an emerging consensus whereby neither rigid rules nor complete discretion are found optimal. Instead, middle-ground monetary regimes based on <b>rules</b> (<b>operative</b> under 'normal' circumstances) to anchor inflation expectations {{over the long}} run, but designed with enough flexibility to mitigate the short-run effect of shocks (with communicated discretion in 'exceptional' circumstances temporarily overriding these rules), are gaining support in theoretical models and policy formulation and implementation. The opposition of 'rules versus discretion' has, thus, reappeared as the synthesis of 'rules cum discretion', in essence as inflation-forecast targeting. But such synthesis is not without major theoretical problems, as we argue in this contribution. Furthermore, the very recent real-world events have made it obvious that the inflation targeting strategy of monetary policy, which rests upon the new consensus paradigm in modern macroeconomics is at best a 'fair weather' model. In the turbulent economic climate of highly unstable inflation, deep financial crisis and world-wide, abrupt economic slowdown nowadays this approach needs serious rethinking to say the least, if not abandoning it altogethe...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{of legal}} {{pluralism}} have stressed how the <b>rules</b> <b>operative</b> in different semi-autonomous social fields are constituted by the interaction, mutual influence and situational use {{of state and}} non-state legal orders. Often, however, state law is treated not as semi-autonomous but (implicitly) as autonomous, as shaping but not as being shaped. The topic {{of this paper is}} how various actors involved in the field of conflict regulation, such as different state agencies, community organisations, NGOs, commercial (legal and illegal) enterprises etc. define legal institutions in their practices and thus shape an operative legal order. The organisations that are involved in governmental roles, be they administrative, charitable, judicial or others, are intent on “capturing the state ” and having their version of law endorsed by state agencies. They transform state law – by entering the “unnamed law ” generated in their operations into state practices rather than into legislation. My focus is on the practices of the Shivsena, a regional political party of the Hindu Right. The interactions of the Shivsena with state agencies show how the “unnamed law” generated in the organisation’s regulatory and judicial practices is introduced into the practices of state agencies. However, the party’s generation of rules and regulations is intricately shaped by it...|$|R
40|$|Seven {{experiments}} {{examined the}} effects of contingent reinforcement on complex responses in 115 undergraduates. To obtain reinforcement, Ss were required to press 2 keys 4 times each, in any order. 70 successful sequences were possible. Exp I showed that Ss developed stereotyped response sequences even when the reinforcement contingency did not require stereotypy. Exp II showed that extinction increased sequence variability. Exp III indicated that when a subclass of possible sequences was reinforced, Ss developed stereotyped responses that belonged to that subclass. Exp IV showed that when Ss were instructed to find the rule that determined whether their sequences would be reinforced, stereotypy did not develop. However, Exp V showed that a history of reinforcement for successful sequences interfered with subsequent rule discovery. When reinforcement was made dependent on sequence variability, higher-order stereotypies developed that satisfied the variability requirement with the least variation possible (Exp VI). Exp VII showed that a history of reinforced pretraining interfered with rule discovery regardless of whether the reinforcement contingencies were still <b>operative</b> in the <b>rule</b> discovery setting. Results suggest that contingent reinforcement may create functional behavioral units in people by encouraging repetition of what has worked in the past.
