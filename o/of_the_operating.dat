5|$|After Rolf Skår was {{appointed}} director of NSC, plans were launched {{to try to}} win the ground station contract for NASA's planned Earth Observing System (EOS). NASA was considering locating the ground station in Greenland, at McMurdo Station in Antarctica or at Esrange in Sweden. Skår invited a NASA delegation to visit Svalbard, and from 1996 NSC and NASA started negotiating a contract to establish a ground station at Longyearbyen. The first satellite to use SvalSat was Landsat 7, which was launched on 15 April 1999. NSC bought SSC's ownership in TSS and Lockheed Martin's ownership in SvalSat in 2001. On 1 February 2002, NSC and Kongsberg Spacetec merged their interests in satellite technology and operations into Kongsberg Satellite Station, which became the sole owner of both SvalSat and TSS. Legally, Kongsberg Satellite Services is a continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> company of TSS. KSAT opened Troll Satellite Station in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Commercial diving {{operations}} may {{expose the}} diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational {{health and safety}} legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical realities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.|$|E
5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} mostly used at {{frequencies}} above the VHF (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 MHz). At these frequencies, the physical length of passive components {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common {{rule of thumb is}} to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher {{as a result of these}} advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, in {{collaboration}} with numerous companies, Microsoft created a home computer system, MSX, which contained {{its own version of}} the DOS operating system, called MSX-DOS; this became relatively popular in Japan, Europe and South America.

The deal with IBM allowed Microsoft to have control of its own QDOS derivative, MS-DOS, and through aggressive marketing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> system to manufacturers of IBM-PC clones Microsoft rose from a small player to one of the major software vendors in the home computer industry. With the release of the Microsoft Mouse on May 2, 1983, Microsoft continued to expand its product line in other markets.

5|$|Significant change {{occurred}} when the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894. The tidal section of the river below Frodsham now flowed into the ship canal, rather than the River Mersey, and the exit lock from Weston Docks also joined the canal rather than the estuary.

The Weston Canal has been little used since.

BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader can be manipulated at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the boot process and Single User Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending on the operating system, may boot into a more basic command-line or text-based version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> system, to facilitate maintenance and recovery action.

5|$|To {{reduce the}} storage {{footprint}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> system, Windows 10 automatically compresses system files. The system {{can reduce the}} storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5GB for 32-bit systems and 2.6GB for 64-bit systems. The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by OEMs, which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance. Furthermore, the Refresh and Reset functions use runtime system files instead, making a separate recovery partition redundant, allowing patches and updates to remain installed following the operation, and further {{reducing the amount of}} space required for Windows 10 by up to 12GB. These functions replace the WIMBoot mode introduced on Windows 8.1 Update, which allowed OEMs to configure low-capacity devices with flash-based storage to use Windows system files out of the compressed WIM image typically used for installation and recovery. Windows 10 also includes a function in its Settings app that allows users to view a breakdown of how their device's storage capacity is being used by different types of files, and determine whether certain types of files are saved to internal storage or an SD card by default.|$|E
