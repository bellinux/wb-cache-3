5|$|Amir's brigade was {{now down}} to one {{battalion}}, which was to attack with Nir's brigade of 50 tanks. To Amir's surprise, a reserve armored battalion of 25 tanks commanded by Colonel Eliashiv Shemshi arrived in the area, en route to Keren's brigade. Short of forces, Amir, with Adan's approval, commandeered Shemshi's battalion, and <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> provide covering fire for Nir's assault on the Firdan bridge.|$|E
5|$|History {{may never}} know {{the true story of}} Lee's {{intentions}} at Gettysburg. He never published memoirs, and his after-action report from the battle was cursory. Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did not write reports. Pickett's report was apparently so bitter that Lee <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> destroy it, and no copy has been found.|$|E
5|$|In a climactic confrontation, Falco reveals to Susan {{that it was}} {{her brother}} who <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> destroy Dallas's {{reputation}} and their relationship.

5|$|A March 1779 {{letter from}} Washington to Scott, still on {{furlough}} in Virginia, <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> recruit volunteers in Virginia and join Washington at Middlebrook on May 1. Men and supplies proved difficult to obtain, delaying Scott's return; during the delay, Washington ordered the recruits to South Carolina to join Benjamin Lincoln, {{who was in}} command of the militia forces there. Reports of significant British troop movements toward Georgia had convinced Washington that the enemy was preparing an invasion from the south.|$|E
5|$|Bissell {{was arrested}} in 1981 in Bloomington, Indiana, and charged with public intoxication, disorderly conduct and pushing a policeman. He was given a 30-day jail sentence, however a plea bargain was made whereby the judge <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> arrange to give a {{performance}} at Indiana University with the proceeds {{to be given to}} charity. Bissell was also given a $100 fine. After being fired by the ABT (along with Gelsey Kirkland), they were re-hired and celebrated by doing a stash of cocaine they had smuggled in the lining of a ballet slipper.|$|E
5|$|By now Nir had {{disengaged}} at El-Qantarah, {{leaving a}} battalion behind, and arrived opposite the Firdan bridge at 12:30 with two tank battalions. While Amir and Nir discussed {{plans for an}} attack, Keren arrived and Adan <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> support Nir and Amir by attacking towards Purkan. Meanwhile, Sharon left Tasa and headed for Suez City, leaving a single reconnaissance company to hold vital ridges such as Hamadia and Kishuf, but not the hills to the north, such as Hamutal. Instead, Keren's brigade gained responsibility for these areas, but Sharon's action further endangered Adan's position.|$|E

5|$|Cho {{was able}} to pass both {{background}} checks and successfully complete both handgun purchases after he presented to the gun dealers his U.S. permanent residency card, his Virginia driver's permit to prove legal age and length of Virginia residence and a checkbook showing his Virginia address, in addition to waiting the required 30-day period between each gun purchase. He was successful at completing both handgun purchases {{because he did not}} disclose on the background questionnaire that a Virginia court had <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> undergo outpatient treatment at a mental health facility.|$|E
5|$|De la Rúa {{was also}} indicted {{for the police}} {{repression}} that {{took place during the}} crisis; he was tried by judge Claudio Bonadio, who declared him innocent in 2009. The Supreme Court overturned Bonadio's ruling and <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> further investigate the matter. De la Rúa and Cavallo were indicted for illegally benefiting the banks that took part in the Megacanje. They were declared innocent on October 6, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan {{soon became}} a {{favourite}} of the king and was the envy of {{other members of the}} court. A plot was hatched to disgrace him and Dunstan was accused of being involved with witchcraft and black magic. The king <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave the court and as Dunstan was leaving the palace his enemies physically attacked him, beat him severely, bound him, and threw him into a cesspool. He managed to crawl out and make his way to the house of a friend. From there, he journeyed to Winchester and entered the service of his uncle, Ælfheah, Bishop of Winchester.|$|E

5|$|Even after {{becoming}} a bishop, Bloet continued to witness royal writs, witnessing six of Rufus' writs while bishop, {{to add to}} his 11 witnessed writs during his chancellorship. Bloet {{was one of the}} bishops in 1097 that attempted to persuade Anselm when the archbishop was in a dispute with Rufus over travelling to Rome to consult with the papacy. When Anselm refused to be persuaded not to go, the king <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave the kingdom, with the support of most of the bishops and nobility.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the victory}} at Buna, for which Herring and Eichelberger were {{appointed}} Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Blamey <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return to Australia for a rest. While in Melbourne, Herring had {{an attack of}} malaria, but recovered to resume command in New Guinea in May. Blamey charged him with responsibility for {{the next phase of}} Operation Cartwheel, the capture of Lae. Herring would command I Corps, which would be part of New Guinea Force, under Blamey and later Mackay. Blamey intended to have Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead command the subsequent phase of the operation, the assault on Madang.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the very}} next day, Thiệu ordered Trưởng and General Lâm Quang Thi to abandon Huế and to {{concentrate}} only sufficient numbers of South Vietnamese units to hold Da Nang. On March 29, as Trưởng was about to board the navy transport ship HQ-404, he {{received a phone call}} from Thiệu, who <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> turn back and retake Da Nang from the North Vietnamese forces. By then, however, South Vietnamese units in I Corps had virtually disappeared, and their commanding officers had fled from their posts.|$|E

(Honorius wrote another letter on the same day to the Bishop-elect of Whithorn, <b>ordering</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be consecrated by Thurstan at York). However John remained unwilling, and the year 1127 was set to continue discussion about the archbishop's rights, effectively stalling Thurstan's claims.|$|R

5|$|In 1802, Nguyễn Ánh, who had {{declared}} himself Emperor Gia Long after capturing Phú Xuân (Huế), appointed Duyệt {{to the position}} of Khâm Sai Chưởng Tả Quân Dinh Bình Tây Tướng Quân ("Marshal of King's Left Division, Tây Sơn Pacification General") and <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> attack Tây Sơn-controlled northern Vietnam. In October 1802, Duyệt captured the north, and then renamed it from Bắc Hà ("Northern River") to Bắc Thành ("Northern Citadel") thus marking ultimate victory of the Nguyễn against the Tây Sơn.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} Pulaski {{was ordered to}} Little Egg Harbor, where in the {{engagement}} on October 15, known as The Affair at Little Egg Harbor, the legion suffered heavy losses. During the following winter Pulaski was stationed at Minisink, {{at that time in}} New Jersey. Ordered {{to take part in a}} punitive Sullivan Expedition against the Iroquois, he was dissatisfied with this command, and intended to leave the service and return to Europe, but instead asked to be reassigned to the Southern front. On February 2, 1779, Washington instead <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> South Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Prokofiev's latest opera projects, {{among them}} his {{desperate attempt to}} appease the {{cultural}} authorities, The Story of a Real Man, were quickly cancelled by the Kirov Theatre.

After a serious relapse in 1949, his doctors <b>ordered</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> limit his composing to an hour a day.|$|E
