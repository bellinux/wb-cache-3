5|$|A 300-page iPhone {{bill from}} AT Mobility mailed {{in a box}} {{was the subject of}} a viral video made by YouTube {{personality}} Justine Ezarik, best known as iJustine, which became an Internet meme in August 2007. Ezarik's video focused on the unnecessary waste of paper, as the detailed bill itemized all data transfers made during the billing period, including every email and text message. Stories of unexpected billing issues began to circulate in blogs and the technical press after the Apple iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release, but this video clip brought the voluminous bills to the attention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media.</b>|$|E

25|$|During Communist rule, {{the mass}} media in Czechoslovakia were {{controlled}} by the Communist Party. Private ownership of any publication or agency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> was generally forbidden, although churches and other organizations published small periodicals and newspapers. Even with this information monopoly {{in the hands of}} organizations under KSČ control, all publications were reviewed by the government's Office for Press and Information.|$|E
25|$|This model, then, focuses {{mostly on}} “structural factors” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media,</b> {{including}} “ownership and control, dependence on other major funding sources (notably, advertisers), and mutual interests and {{relationships between the}} media and those who make the news and {{have the power to}} define it and explain what it means” (xi). Though the importance of this model and its influence on media studies is not to be denied, later thinkers have criticized this emphasis on structure over agency, because it neglects the ability of audiences of this media to question the prevailing notions represented.|$|E

The 1972 Watergate disclosures, it is true, were made by only a score of the members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media,</b> but I remember Teapot Dome when only one of our 1,750 dailies (the Albuquerque Morning Journal) dared to tell the truth about White House corruption.

25|$|González {{had a long}} scar {{across his}} left cheek that, {{according}} to his autobiography, some members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> of the 1940s attributed to his being a Mexican-American pachuco and hence involved in knife fights. This was one more slur that embittered González towards the media in general. The scar was actually {{the result of a}} prosaic street accident in 1935 when he was seven years old: pushing a scooter too fast, he ran into a passing car and had his cheek gashed open by its door handle. He spent two weeks in the hospital as a result.|$|E
25|$|The 1971 {{elections}} were relatively free and honest. Both parties offered presidential candidates who were compromise choices {{of the major}} party factions. The PLH ran Jorge Bueso Arias, and the PNH nominated Ramón Ernesto Cruz. Most observers anticipated a PLH victory, but the PNH ran a more aggressive campaign, making use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> and of modern campaign techniques {{for the first time}} in Honduran history. On election day, Cruz scored an impressive victory, gaining 299,807 votes to 269,989 for Bueso Arias. However, a disturbing note for the PNH was that popular participation in the election had declined significantly from 1965. Only slightly over two-thirds of those registered to vote had done so, although the constitution made voting obligatory.|$|E

25|$|The West Japan Railway Company is {{very strict}} {{when it comes}} to punctuality, and commuters often depend on near-perfect timing on the part of trains to commute to and from work on time. This is because at {{stations}} (including the derailed train's next scheduled stop at Amagasaki Station) trains meet {{on both sides of the}} same platform to allow people to transfer between rapid and local trains running on the same line. As a result, a small delay in one train can significantly cascade through the timetable for the rest of the day due to the tightness of the schedule. Immediately after the rail crash occurred, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> pointed to the congested schedule of the Fukuchiyama Line as an indirect factor. In fact, cumulative changes over the previous three years had reduced the leeway in the train's schedule from 71 to 28 seconds over the 15minutes between Takarazuka and Amagasaki stations.|$|E

[...] He said he felt like he was in [...] "internal exile" [...] following September 11 attacks as the US media had become [...] "conservative and timid" [...] and did not welcome the provocative art that he felt the need to create. [...] Nevertheless, Spiegelman asserted he left not over political differences, as had been widely reported, but because The New Yorker was not interested in doing serialized work, which he wanted to do with his next project.|$|E

500|$|The {{period between}} 1950 and 1975 saw {{major changes in}} the way in which history and {{literature}} were approached in terms of interpretation and writing. It also produced a change in the self perception of Spanish American novelists [...] The development of the cities, the coming of age of a large middle class, the Cuban Revolution, the Alliance for Progress, an increase in communication between the countries of Latin America, the greater importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media,</b> and a greater attention to Latin America from Europe and the United States all contributed to this change. The most important political events of the period were the Cuban Revolution in 1959 and the Chilean coup d'état in 1973. [...] The fall of General Perón in Argentina, the protracted violent struggle of the urban guerrillas, brutally repressed in Argentina and Uruguay, and the unending violence in Colombia also affected writers, as they generated explanations, or testimonies, or provided a troubling background for their work.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, {{like many}} other U.S. media sources, the Times had {{suffered}} from a decline in public perceptions of credibility in the U.S. from 2004 to 2012. A Pew Research Center survey in 2012 asked respondents about their views on credibility of various news organizations.

Media analyst Brooke Gladstone of WNYC's On the Media, writing for The New York Times, says that the decline in U.S. public trust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> can be explained (1) by the rise of the polarized Internet-driven news; (2) by a decline in trust in U.S. institutions more generally; and (3) by the fact that [...] "Americans say they want accuracy and impartiality, but the polls suggest that, actually, most of us are seeking affirmation." ...|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> have <b>the</b> main {{function}} <b>of</b> {{serving as a}} mediator between society and the authorities and is, therefore, positioned to be a catalyst for change in society.

It is also a good reflection, or indicator, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pace <b>of</b> transition on <b>the</b> regional level, and an objective criterion <b>of</b> regional democratization. <b>The</b> regional media markets are not shaped entirely by the national government.
