This paper presents a simple model to study employment variability due to fluctuations in labor productivity. The study of a production function demonstrates that the firm’s use of a factor of production is inversely related to the productivity of that factor.

Immunoneutralization of endogenous TGF- � provided by serum or TGF-�-secreting cells, as e. g., neurons, in culture abolishes the neurotrophic effect of GDNF.

40|$|With a {{focus on}} a {{specific}} employment group this research attempted {{to add to the}} knowledge on the content of the psychological contract. Structured interviews with 35 managers generated 651 responses relating to the content of their psychological contracts.

One component (23 items) included the managers' expectations relating to the organisation's obligations. The other component (16 items) included the managers' obligations relating to the perceived organisation's expectations. Validation of the measure was based on a questionnaire completed by 124 managers. Participants considered all items to be important aspects of the contract.
