After cowing several police checkpoints {{on the edge of}} the capital with threats of machine-gun and artillery fire, the plotters put rebel sentries in their place to seal off Saigon from incoming or <b>outgoing</b> <b>traffic.</b> They then captured communication facilities in the capital, including the post office, to prevent messages from being sent in or out. As his troops took over the city, Phát sat in a civilian vehicle and placidly said [...] "We'll be holding a press conference in town this afternoon at 4 p.m." [...] He said [...] "This is nothing to worry about. Just a little operation against some politicians." [...] The rebels set up their command post in the Saigon home of General Duong Ngoc Lam, who had been removed from his post as Mayor of Saigon by Khánh. Lam had commanded the Civil Guard during Diệm's presidency and was one of his trusted supporters.|$|E

He promised to capture Khánh and pursue a policy of increased anti-communism, stronger government and military. Phát stated he would return to the crypto-fascist, Catholic integrist ideology of the Ngô family to lay the foundation for his junta. According to historian George McTurnan Kahin, Phát's broadcast was [...] "triumphant" [...] and may have prompted senior officers who were neither part of the original conspiracy nor fully loyal to Khánh to conclude that Phát and Đức would not embrace them if they rallied to their side.|$|E

2500|$|Web {{traffic is}} the amount of data sent and {{received}} by visitors to a web site. This necessarily does not include the traffic generated by bots. Since the mid-1990s, web traffic has been the largest portion of Internet traffic. [...] This is determined by the number of visitors and the number of pages they visit. Sites monitor the incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>traffic</b> to see which parts or pages of their site are popular and if there are any apparent trends, such as one specific page being viewed mostly by people in a particular country. There are many ways to monitor this traffic and the gathered data is used to help structure sites, highlight security problems or indicate a potential lack of bandwidth.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{network traffic}} behavior using correlation analysis {{of control and}} data planes. The Long-Range Dependence behavior (LRD) of the control and data planes traffic is examined on different directions {{with respect to the}} enterprise network. The approach is tested on the TCP traffic of the Network Intrusion Dataset provided by the Information Exploration Shootout project. Results show that network attacks in the dataset that affect the aggregate traffic cause the incoming control <b>traffic</b> or the <b>outgoing</b> data <b>traffic</b> to fail to exhibit LRD behavior, whereas the traffic as a whole still exhibits LRD behavior. These two subgroups are the only ones affected, as the attacks in the dataset are carried via the incoming control traffic, and the response to this traffic appears at the <b>outgoing</b> data <b>traffic.</b> These two subgroups have low traffic volume, hence they significantly reduce the amount of traffic analysis. In addition, correlation analysis of control and data planes traffic will enable the detection of abnormal behaviors that might not be detected by previous work that only look at the traffic as a whol...|$|R

50|$|With multiqueue NICs, {{additional}} performance improvements can {{be achieved}} by distributing <b>outgoing</b> <b>traffic</b> among different transmit queues.

Afterwards, packets of ten data points are transmitted to our data logging server every ten seconds over a pre-defined range of network ports.
