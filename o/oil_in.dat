30|$|Most of the <b>oils</b> <b>in</b> the Rewapu Block {{are light}} and normal oils, which are {{distinctly}} {{different from those}} heavy <b>oils</b> <b>in</b> {{the northern part of}} the Halahatang region. Significant biodegradation can be eliminated due to lack of 25 -norhopanes and the absence of a “hump” on the baseline of chromatograms. Exceptions are extremely heavy <b>oils</b> <b>in</b> Wells RP 7 and RP 101 C. These oils have an apparent chromatographic baseline “hump,” but no 25 -norhopanes. The alkylated dibenzothiophenes were apparently reduced. Therefore, biodegradation was not severe and water washing appears to be the principal factor causing the origin of heavy <b>oils</b> <b>in</b> Wells RP 7 and RP 101 C. The local geological background presents conditions that are favorable for water washing alteration in these wells.|$|R

5|$|By 1778 Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele stated firmly that molybdena was (indeed) neither galena nor graphite.

5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the <b>oil,</b> <b>in</b> turn sending the burning <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E

5|$|Emulsions are {{a type of}} colloid {{in which}} surface tension plays a role. Tiny {{fragments}} of oil suspended in pure water will spontaneously assemble themselves into much larger masses.
