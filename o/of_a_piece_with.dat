5|$|Seneb's {{dwarfism}} {{is depicted}} realistically in the sculpture. It portrays {{him with a}} large head but small arms and legs. This possibly indicates that he had achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism that most severely affects the fastest-growing {{parts of the body}} – particularly the femur and humerus, which become short and squat – and stunts the forearms and lower legs. It also affects the head, producing a relatively large skull with a bulging forehead and often a depressed nasal bridge. An alternative diagnosis is dysmelia – a condition that produces short arms and legs. Seneb's wife Senites is portrayed far less realistically; her depiction is <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> other contemporary portraits of high-ranking Egyptian women.|$|E

[...] In 1993 he had offered to escort Clinton on a speaking visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial at a time when some veterans were angrily challenging Clinton's moral right to go there. [...] He also struck up a friendship with an anti-war leader, David Ifshin, who had once traveled to Hanoi to make an anti-American propaganda broadcast that McCain had heard in his cell.|$|E

500|$|According to Shani D'Cruze of the Feminist Crime Research Network, {{the fact}} that she was Irish was a {{significant}} factor in the widespread revulsion felt towards Webster in Great Britain. Many Irish people had emigrated to England since the Great Famine of 1849, but met widespread prejudice and persistent associations with criminality and drunkenness. The Irish were at worst depicted as bestial and subhuman, and there were repeated episodes of violence between Irish and English workers as well as attacks by Fenians (Irish nationalists) in England. The demonisation of Webster as [...] "hardly human", as O'Donnell put it, was <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> the public and judicial perceptions of the Irish as innately criminal.|$|E
500|$|According to O'Fallon, [...] "More {{may have}} been part of a Federalist {{strategy}} to get the Court to intervene in the political struggle over the judiciary." [...] Given that Justice Samuel Chase was acquitted by the Senate in his impeachment case on March 1, 1805, the day before the release of the More decision, [...] "ne can imagine John Marshall passing a sigh of relief as he handed down the judgment in More." [...] "he dismissal of More marked the end of Federalist efforts to obtain a Supreme Court ruling, directly or by implication, that the repeal of the 1801 Judiciary Act was unconstitutional. [...] "More is <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> Marbury and Stuart v. Laird in its avoidance of an opportunity for an open clash with political critics of the courts. It further shares with Marbury the characteristic of declining an exercise of jurisdiction that the Court found to be unwarranted." [...] O'Fallon argues: ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{awarded the}} album {{a score of}} nine out of ten, the {{reviewer}} for NME said, [...] "At no point does [...] rock. It glides with a beautiful, uninhibited momentum." [...] The reviewer described McCulloch's voice as an [...] "instrument honed by years of life, love and all the shitty bits in between to a ravishing state of molten cashmere" [...] and the album as [...] "flawless" [...] for every [...] "second of its defiantly brief 38-and-a-half minutes". M. Tye Comer for CMJ said, [...] " [...] revisit the melancholia they've tussled with for nearly 20 years with a mature soul and a romantic urgency, having grown up without growing old." [...] Awarding the album {{four out of five}} stars, Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing for Allmusic said the album [...] "feels <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> their earlier albums, not only sonically, but in terms of quality." [...] Mark Richard-San for Pitchfork Media said, [...] "The over-the-top, bass-driven rockers of yore have been replaced with an album of introspective, acoustic songs appropriate for these aging geezers." [...] Richard-San also described McCulloch as having a [...] "rich, resonant voice", adding [...] "the quality of his singing is perfect – a weary voice transmitting from some abandoned studio of yesteryear." ...|$|E

500|$|Tim McCanlies {{was hired}} to write the script, though Bird was {{somewhat}} displeased with having another writer on board, as he wanted to write the screenplay himself. He later changed his mind after reading McCanlies' then-unproduced screenplay for Secondhand Lions. In Bird's original story treatment, America and the USSR were at war at the end, with the Giant dying. McCanlies {{decided to have a}} brief scene displaying his survival, stating, [...] "You can't kill E.T. and then not bring him back." [...] McCanlies finished the script within two months. McCanlies was given a three-month schedule to complete a script, and it was by way of the film's tight schedule that Warner Bros. [...] "didn't have time to mess with us" [...] as McCanlies said. The question of the Giant's backstory was purposefully ignored as to keep the story focused on his relationship with Hogarth. Bird considered the story difficult to develop due to its combination of unusual elements, such as [...] "paranoid fifties sci-fi movies with the innocence of something like The Yearling." [...] Hughes himself was sent a copy of McCanlies' script and sent a letter back, saying how pleased he was with the version. In the letter, Hughes stated, [...] "I want to tell you how much I like what Brad Bird has done. He’s made something all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece,</b> <b>with</b> terrific sinister gathering momentum and the ending came to me as a glorious piece of amazement. He’s made a terrific dramatic situation out of the way he’s developed The Iron Giant. I can’t stop thinking about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Quevedo {{produced}} a vast quantity of poetry.

2500|$|The {{discrepancy}} in William's accounts led Robinson {{to conclude that}} the appearance of the missionaries' names in the earlier book was a spurious addition by the abbey's scribes, <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> the passages in the present text that include a patently fraudulent [...] "Charter of StPatrick", that describe Abbot Henry of Blois (1171) as [...] "of blessed memory", and that mention a fire which occurred at the abbey in 1184. Robinson and Bartrum proceed to treat Fagan as an invention of Geoffrey subsequently taken up by others. Baring-Gould, Rees, and Mullins modify this somewhat: while admitting the general falsehood of the account in Geoffrey, they suggest that the names of Fagan and his companions were probably genuine but thatin the absence of more detailed surviving recordsthey had been taken up and added to the legendary accounts of King Lucius.|$|E
2500|$|Back at Cambridge, Charles studied {{hard for}} his Little Go {{preliminary}} exam, as a fail {{would mean a}} re-sit the following year. He dropped his drinking companions and resumed attending Henslow's Friday evening soirées. For the exam he slogged away at Greek and Latin, and studied William Paley's Evidences of Christianity, becoming so delighted with Paley's logic that he learnt it well. This was a text he also had to study for his finals, and he was [...] "convinced that I could have written out {{the whole of the}} Evidences with perfect correctness, but not of course in the clear language of Paley." [...] Later, on the Beagle expedition, he saw evidence which challenged Paley's rose-tinted view, but at this time he was convinced that the Christian revelation established [...] "a future state of reward and punishment" [...] which [...] "gives order for confusion: makes the moral world <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> the natural". As with Cambridge University, God gave authority and assigned stations in life, misconduct was penalised and excellence bountifully rewarded. Charles took the one-day verbal examination on 24 March 1830. There were three hours in the morning on the classics and three in the afternoon on the New Testament and Paley. The next day he was delighted to be informed that he had passed.|$|E
