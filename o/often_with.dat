Terns are in general medium to large birds, typically with gray or white plumage, <b>often</b> <b>with</b> black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. Skimmers are tropical and subtropical species.
