50|$|The sizing {{operation}} is a squeezing operation that minimizes {{the thickness of}} the metal. Sizing is performed in an <b>open</b> <b>die</b> and only the surface where the die and workpiece touch will be sized. Many ferrous metal castings are sized to sharpen corners and flatten holes around piercings. Sizing pressure is determined by area to be sized, the metal used, and the change in metal thickness from the operation. Sizing is usually performed on semi-finished parts or parts that require an accurate finish. Stop blocks are used to ensure close tolerances.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} thought of forging {{equipment}} is the hammer and anvil. The principles behind the hammer and anvil are still used today in drop-hammer equipment. The principle behind {{the machine is}} very simple, raise the hammer and then drop it or propel it into the workpiece, which rests on the anvil. The main variations between drop-hammers is {{in the way that}} the hammer is powered; the most common being air and steam hammers. Drop-hammers usually operate in the vertical position. The main reason for this is because excess energy (energy that isn't used to deform the workpiece) that isn't released as heat or sound needs to be transmitted to the foundation. Moreover, a large machine base is needed to absorb the impacts.To overcome some of the shortcomings of the drop-hammer the counterblow machine or impactor is used. In a counterblow machine both the hammer and anvil move and the workpiece is held between them. Here excess energy becomes recoil. This allows for the machine to work horizontally and consist of a smaller base. Other advantages include less noise, heat and vibrations. It also produces a distinctly different flow pattern. Both of these machines can be used for <b>open</b> <b>die</b> or closed die forging. A forging press, often just called a press, is used for press forging.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A new conical splay test is {{developed}} {{to assess the}} mechanisms of damage evolution {{in a range of}} stress states representative of hot rolling. The test consists of a bulk forming operation between <b>open</b> <b>dies,</b> during which plastic deformation occurs across a gradient of stress states from near-uniaxial tension to highly compressive. The transition between tensile and compressive stress state allows the microstructure to be accurately linked to the corresponding stress state. FE simulation of the new test is used to analyze the stress-state history dur-ing deformation. A low-carbon free-cutting steel, which is prone to edge cracking during hot rolling, is studied and the modes of damage evolution are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Only anecdotal {{reports of}} {{displaced}} fractures set by internal fixation predate Joseph Lister's 1865 introduction of antiseptic surgery, whereupon Lister reported silver wire on a displaced petellar fracture. Even before radiography, Lane found that conventional setting by manipulation and splints yielded poor outcomes—bone disunion and joint changes or wear in individuals under much physical activity—and Lane started with wires and screws in 1892. The conservative medical community was vehemently opposed, so revolutionary was Lane's approach that organizations certifying surgeons sometimes automatically dismissed students able {{to elaborate on}} such procedures, as nearly 50% of patients whose closed fractures were <b>opened</b> <b>died</b> by ensuing infections. Yet with aseptic surgical techniques previously unheard of, Lane forged ahead.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of internal voids is commonly observed throughout the casting and solidification of large size ingots. Their mechanical closure is generally achieved {{during the initial}} deformation of a hot forming process. The present work focuses on the determination of optimal forging conditions for void elimination in large steel ingots {{with respect to the}} involved materials and industrial processes. A state of the art is compiled as initial research in order to develop a solid background in void elimination theory. An extensive review of void closure models is presented and characterisation techniques are discussed. It is shown that current void closure models lack application to industrial scale forgings. An analysis of the industrial partner’s <b>open</b> <b>die</b> forging procedure ensues and characteristic forging sequences are introduced. Feasibility for further forging analysis using experimental data is evaluated and successfully proposed. A novel method for fast calculating void closure models is developed. Rational polynomial functions are established for the calculation of material dependant constants. 3 D mapping is used to evaluate the influence of the triaxiality state and material parameters. The void closure model is validated for use on high strength steels from the industrial partner. Void closure is modeled and simulated during an <b>open</b> <b>die</b> forging sequence. The effect of in-billet void positioning is studied and the forging sequence effectiveness for void closure is validated and characterized for different zones. An original combination of data from relative void closure and volumetric strain rate provides a way for forging optimisation. Novel software for successful <b>open</b> <b>die</b> slab forging, Forge Calculus, is developed based on large amounts of experimental data. The in-house code provides fundamental information for setting forging standards. Future development concerning real time prediction of forging quality is discussed...|$|E
