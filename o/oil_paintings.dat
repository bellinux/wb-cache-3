40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate whether the calming effect induced by viewing traditional Chinese landscape paintings would make disengagement from that mental state more difficult, as measured by performance on a cognitive control task. In Experiment 1 we examined the subjective experience of viewing traditional Chinese landscape <b>paintings</b> vs. realistic <b>oil</b> landscape <b>paintings</b> in a behavioral study. Our results confirmed that, as predicted, traditional Chinese landscape paintings induce greater levels of relaxation and mind wandering and lower levels of object-oriented absorption and recognition, compared to realistic <b>oil</b> landscape <b>paintings.</b> In Experiment 2 we used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to explore the behavioural and neural effects of viewing traditional Chinese landscape paintings on a task requiring cognitive control (i. e., the flanker task) —administered immediately following exposure to paintings. Contrary to our prediction, the behavioural data demonstrated that compared to realistic <b>oil</b> landscape <b>paintings,</b> exposure to traditional Chinese landscape paintings had no effect on performance on the flanker task. However, the neural data demonstrated an interaction effect such that there was greater activation in the inferior parietal cortex (IPC) and the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) on incongruent compared with congruent flanker trials when participants switched from viewing traditional Chinese landscape paintings to the flanker task than when they switched from realistic <b>oil</b> landscape <b>paintings.</b> These results suggest that switching from traditional Chinese landscape paintings placed greater demands on the brain’s attention and working memory networks during the flanker task than did switching from realistic <b>oil</b> landscape <b>paintings...</b>|$|R

40|$|Repentir is {{a mobile}} {{application}} that employs marker-less tracking and augmented reality to enable gallery visitors {{to explore the}} under drawing and successive stages of pigment beneath an <b>oil</b> <b>painting's</b> surface. Repentir recognises the position and orientation of a specific painting within a photograph and precisely overlays images that were captured during that painting's creation. The viewer may then browse through the work's multiple states and closely examine its painted surface {{in one of two}} ways: sliding or rubbing. Our current prototype recognises realist painter Nathan Walsh's most recent work, "Transamerica". Repentir enables the viewer to explore intermediary stages in the painting's development and see what is usually lost within the materially additive painting process. The prototype offers an innovative approach to digital reproduction and provides users with unique insights into the painter's working method...|$|R
