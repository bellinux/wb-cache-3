40|$|This work {{develops}} a performance analysis {{for a particular}} distribution of inertial sensors as they {{are assumed to be}} implemented on a prototype stabilized platform for a new UAV aircraft (under development at VTUL PVO and AVEKO now). The device to be stabilized is a 2 -axis gimbal – inner and <b>outer</b> <b>gimbal</b> <b>axis</b> - that will have an attached array of optical and electric sensors at one of its axis. Gyroscopes are planned to be used to sense the angular rates of this highly non-linear and coupled system. The whole set of equations for the complete system is introduced with a specific focus on the inner gimbal dynamics. The use of different observers to filter the data obtained by the sensors is analyzed along with the effectiveness of various types of controllers. The inner gimbal system is modeled and several simulations are performed to study the effect of different practical contraints -actuator saturation, sensor bandwidth, sampling frequency, etc., in addition to the performance for different disturbance frequencies and controller parameters.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration s (NASA) Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) {{launched}} on June 18, 2009 from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas V launch vehicle into a direct insertion trajectory to the Moon LRO, designed, built, {{and operated by}} the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD, is gathering crucial data on the lunar environment that will help astronauts prepare for long-duration lunar expeditions. During the mission s nominal life of one year its six instruments and one technology demonstrator will find safe landing site, locate potential resources, characterize the radiation environment and test new technology. To date, LRO has been operating well {{within the bounds of}} its requirements and has been collecting excellent science data images taken from the LRO Camera Narrow Angle Camera (LROC NAC) of the Apollo landing sites have appeared on cable news networks. A significant amount of information on LRO s science instruments is provided at the LRO mission webpage. LRO s Attitude Control System (ACS), in addition to controlling the orientation of the spacecraft is also responsible for pointing the High Gain Antenna (HGA). A dual-axis (or double-gimbaled) antenna, deployed on a meter-long boom, is required to point at a selected Earth ground station. Due to signal loss over the distance from the Moon to Earth, pointing precision for the antenna system is very tight. Since the HGA has to be deployed in spaceflight, its exact geometry relative to the spacecraft body is uncertain. In addition, thermal distortions and mechanical errors/tolerances must be characterized and removed to realize the greatest gain from the antenna system. These reasons necessitate the need for an in-flight calibration. Once in orbit around the moon, a series of attitude maneuvers was conducted to provide data needed to determine optimal parameters to load onboard, which would account for the environmental and mechanical errors at any antenna orientation. The nominal geometry for the HGA involves an <b>outer</b> <b>gimbal</b> <b>axis</b> that is exactly perpendicular to the inner <b>gimbal</b> <b>axis,</b> and a target direction that is exactly perpendicular to the <b>outer</b> <b>gimbal</b> <b>axis.</b> For this nominal geometry, closed-form solutions of the desired gimbal angles are simple to get for a desired target direction specified in the spacecraft body fame. If the gimbal axes and the antenna boresight are slightly misaligned, the nominal closed-form solution is not sufficiently accurate for computing the gimbal angles needed to point at a target. In this situation, either a general closed-form solution has to be developed for a mechanism with general geometries, or a correction scheme has to be applied to the nominal closed-form solutions. The latter has been adopted for Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) {{as can be seen in}} Reference 1, and the former has been used for LRO. The advantage of the general closed-form solution is the use of a small number of parameters for the correction of nominal solutions, especially in the regions near singularities. Singularities here refer to cases when the nominal closed-form solutions have two or more solutions. Algorithm complexity, however, is the disadvantage of the general closed-form solution...|$|R

40|$|This {{innovation}} is a miniature or micro sized semiconductor sensor design that provides two axis direct non-intrusive measurement of skin friction or wall shear stress in fluid flow. The sensor is fabricated by micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) technology, enabling small size and low cost reproductions. The sensors have been fabricated by utilizing MEMS fabrication processes to bond a sensing element wafer to a fluid coupling wafer. This layering technique provides for an {{out of plane}} dimension {{that is on the}} same order of length as the inplane dimensions. The sensor design has the following characteristics: a shear force collecting plate with dimensions that can be tailored to various application specific requirements such as spatial resolution, temporal resolution and shear force range and resolution.

The dual <b>axis</b> <b>gimbal</b> structure has torsional hinges with embedded piezoresistive torsional strain gauges which provide a voltage output that is correlated to the applied shear stress (and excitation current) on force collection plate that is located on the flow boundary surface (hence the transduction method). This combination of design elements create a force concentration and resolution structure that enables the generation of a large stress on the strain gauge from the small shear stress on the flow boundary wall.
