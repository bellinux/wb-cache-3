5|$|Among scientists, he {{is perhaps}} best known for his work on the {{ligament}} which bears his name. His work on the rare and vestigial Ligament of Struthers {{came to the attention of}} Charles Darwin, who used it in his Descent <b>of</b> <b>Man</b> <b>to</b> help argue the case that man and other mammals shared a common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the nature}} <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> build the most {{complicated}} cage of rules and regulations in which to trap himself, and then, with equal ingenuity and zest, to bend his brain {{to the problem of}} wriggling triumphantly out again. Lent was a challenge; the game was to ferret out the loopholes.|$|E
5|$|The {{term was}} first used in a {{scientific}} context by Charles Lyell in the third edition (1851) of his book Elements of Geology in relation to missing parts of the geological column, but it was popularized in its present meaning by its appearance on page xi of his book Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man of 1863. By {{that time it was}} generally thought {{that the end of the}} last glacial period marked the first appearance of humanity, but Lyell drew on new findings in his Antiquity <b>of</b> <b>Man</b> <b>to</b> put the origin of human beings much further back in the deep geological past. Lyell wrote that it remained a profound mystery how the huge gulf between man and beast could be bridged. Lyell's vivid writing fired the public imagination, inspiring Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) and Louis Figuier's 1867 second edition of La Terre avant le déluge ("Earth before the Flood"), which included dramatic illustrations of savage men and women wearing animal skins and wielding stone axes, in place of the Garden of Eden shown in the 1863 edition.|$|E

5|$|No.457 Squadron {{was formed}} at RAF Baginton in England on 16June 1941. It was {{equipped}} with Supermarine Spitfires and was the second RAAF fighter unit to be formed in England after No.452 Squadron. The establishment of both these squadrons formed part of an expansion of RAF Fighter Command which sought to improve its ability to defend Britain from a renewed German air offensive and to conduct offensive operations over occupied Europe. At {{the time of its}} formation the squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader Peter Malam Brothers, both flight commanders and all members of the ground crew were British, but most pilots were Australian. The squadron's ground crew component had been formed at RAAF Station Williamtown in Australia on 10June, and departed for England on 7August. On the same day No.457 Squadron moved to RAF Jurby and thence to RAF Andreas, which were both situated on the Isle <b>of</b> <b>Man</b> <b>to</b> undertake training. While at the Isle of Man the squadron trained both its own pilots and pilots from other squadrons for operational duties, and for a time functioned as an operational training unit at RAF Andreas. It also escorted Allied convoys in the Irish Sea, but did not make contact with German aircraft. By October all the British pilots other than Brothers and the flight commanders had been replaced by Australians. The squadron's ground crew arrived in Britain during October and November, making it an almost entirely Australian unit.|$|E

In one village, Sonah Creek, the population consisted solely <b>of</b> <b>men.</b> Similarly, gender ratios in Soso camp (17 times more males) and ULC (9 times more males) are highly skewed towards males.|$|R

In the ancient Sumerian story, The Epic of Gilgamesh, {{one of the oldest}} pieces of literature in the world, the cedars feature prominently.

25|$|The central {{thesis of}} Unto Caesar is that Communism and National Socialism were “revolutionary secular {{religions}} {{arising from the}} arrogant endeavour <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> transform religious promises directly into worldly reality” (Markus Huttner). Voigt argues that such 'secular religions' {{pose a threat to}} the fundamentals of European civilization by seeking to “render to Caesar what is God's” and can only be defeated if the western democracies, particularly Britain, stand up and actively defend Christianity and Civilization against the totalitarian onslaught.|$|E
25|$|The play is also full of {{constraint}} imagery. Hamlet describes Denmark as a prison, {{and himself}} as {{being caught in}} birdlime. He mocks the ability <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> bring about his own ends, and points out that some divine force molds men's aims into something other than what they intend. Other characters also speak of constraint, such as Polonius, who orders his daughter to lock herself from Hamlet's pursuit, and describes her as being tethered. This adds to the play's description of Hamlet's inability to act out his revenge.|$|E

25|$|For {{nearly a}} decade his work was {{directed}} mainly to the relationship <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> the apes. This led him directly into a clash with Richard Owen, a man widely disliked for his behaviour whilst also being admired for his capability. The struggle was to culminate in some severe defeats for Owen. Huxley's Croonian Lecture, delivered before the Royal Society in 1858 on The Theory of the Vertebrate Skull was the start. In this, he rejected Owen's theory that {{the bones of the}} skull and the spine were homologous, an opinion previously held by Goethe and Lorenz Oken.|$|E
25|$|When Caine {{was nine}} he lost {{two of his}} young sisters within a year. Five year old Sarah {{developed}} hydrocephaly after a fever.

He was put on a boat to Ramsey by his father, with a label pinned on his coat and assurances that his uncle would meet him. A fierce storm occurred preventing the ferry from reaching land. Caine was rescued by a large rowing boat. He would later draw on this experience when writing the scene in The Bondman in which Stephen Orry is cast ashore there.|$|E
25|$|During the pre-earth life, God the Father {{presented}} {{a plan to}} have a Savior {{make it possible for}} mankind to be saved. The purpose of an earth life was to give men the opportunity to demonstrate obedience to the commandments of God while outside of his presence. This is the central test of the evolution or eternal progression <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> godhood. Jesus Christ stepped forward as the chosen Savior. However, Lucifer, one of the spirits, proposed a rival plan whereby every soul would be saved, he would receive God's glory, and human agency would be eliminated. When God rejected that plan, the War in Heaven ensued, resulting in Lucifer and one-third part of the spirits being cast out and denied ever receiving physical bodies. Lucifer became Satan, or the devil.|$|E
