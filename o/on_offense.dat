In order to achieve the purpose of the study we have chosen the preparatory works to the new legislation <b>on</b> sexual <b>offenses</b> from 2005 until today. The study's empirical work has been further narrowed to the children, which means that a distinction is made in the new legislation <b>on</b> sexual <b>offenses</b> to 6 chapter 4 - 6 §§. The theoretical starting point is the childhood sociology and the method used is a content analysis. The result shows that the preparation of children in the new legislation <b>on</b> sexual <b>offenses</b> can be divided into continuous central themes: children 's agency, children than in adults and children's properties and responsibility. ...|$|R
