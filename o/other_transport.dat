5|$|Route98 is {{maintained}} by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), an Illinois state agency responsible for maintaining highways and <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> infrastructure in the state. IDOT is responsible for collecting traffic data on Illinois state highways; this data is {{measured in terms of}} annual average daily traffic, an estimate of the number of vehicles which use a road on any given day in a particular year. In 2009, IDOT estimated that 4400vehicles used the western portion of Route98, 3900 used the central portion, and 3700 used the eastern portion. No part of Route98 is included in the National Highway System, a network of roads considered significant to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 300 to 500 mercenaries, Katanga had approximately 14,000 to 17,000 gendarmes in its service, of whom around 7,000 had not received military training. Through reconnaissance, the UN had learned that these forces were concentrated on defending the southern tier of the province (much of the north was already under central government control), with about 5,150 troops {{in and around the}} towns of Jadotville, Kolwezi, and Bunkeya. Another 2,000 garrisoned Élisabethville. The UN also estimated that the Katangese Air Force possessed a number of Harvards, Magisters, and de Havilland Vampires, amounting to a dozen combat aircraft, as well as some <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> aircraft and small planes. However, they believed that many Katangese aircraft were unserviceable. ONUC intelligence observed limited stockpiles of ammunition, petroleum, oil, and lubricants at a few airfields.|$|E

25|$|The 'look' of the London Underground map (including 45 degree angles, evenly spaced 'stations', {{and some}} {{geographic}} distortion) has been emulated by many other subway systems around the world.

25|$|The {{specification}} {{recommends that}} RTP port numbers are {{chosen to be}} even and that each associated RTCP port be the next higher odd number. However, a single port is chosen for RTP and RTCP in applications that multiplex the protocols. RTP and RTCP typically use unprivileged UDP ports (1024 to 65535), but may also use <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> protocols, most notably, SCTP and DCCP, as the protocol design is transport independent.|$|E
25|$|Two <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> {{systems are}} {{believed}} to play subsequent roles in iminoglycinuria, when mutations in them are present. The neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 (affecting glycine, proline, and other neutral amino acids like cysteine and tryptophan), associated with Hartnup disease, {{plays a role in}} iminoglycinuria as a modifier to PAT2 mutations and is also directly affected by the actions of SIT1. The glycine-specific transporter, SLC6A18, also has an effect on the iminoglycinuria phenotype by either compounding or compensating for failures of glycine transport.|$|E
25|$|Virgin Trains {{suffered}} poor punctuality {{compared with}} some <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> operators between 2001 and 2006, according to Office of Rail Regulation statistics. Punctuality did gradually improve until {{the introduction of}} a new timetable (in December 2008), following the upgrade of the West Coast Main Line, which resulted in a dip in performance. Performance subsequently recovered and peaked during 2010-2011, but then fell again and reached a new low for the year ending 31 March 2013 of 83.6% (MAA).|$|E

25|$|A Government {{grant of}} $50,000,000 to {{municipal}} transport authorities in 1977 enabled the Board to purchase 96 Bristol buses that entered service between 1978 and 1981. Nearly {{a decade later}} the last major fleet upgrade was made when the Board, in conjunction with several <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> authorities around the country, ordered 90 MAN buses {{as part of a}} bulk order in 1986. Though an additional 9 were ordered later, they did not arrive until after the Board was disestablished.|$|E

50|$|WAMP {{requires}} a reliable, ordered, full-duplex message channel as a transport layer, and by default uses Websocket.

25|$|Historically very car-dependent, as of 2010, {{transport}} {{funding in}} New Zealand is still heavily dominated by money for road projectsthe National-led government proposes to spend $21billion on roading infrastructure after 2012, yet only $0.7billion on <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> projects (public transport, walking and cycling). This has been criticised by {{opponents of the}} current government strategy as irresponsible, in light of increasing fuel prices and congestion. Public transport is primarily a local government responsibility whereas state highways are the responsibility of central government.|$|E
25|$|Although Parliament {{has limited}} {{the amount that}} {{authorities}} can borrow, for some time it had been speculated that the regular income obtained from the congestion charge and other revenues {{could be used to}} securitise a bond issue that finances <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> projects across London. TfL issued their first bond for £200million in 2005, to be repaid at 5% interest over 30 years.
