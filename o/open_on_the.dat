5|$|Before the 2003 season, both Jason Whittle and Mike Rosenthal {{left the}} Giants via free agency, leaving two {{starting}} positions <b>open</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> offensive line. By {{the start of}} the Giants' pre-season minicamp, Allen was considered the favorite to start at right tackle, but he remained in competition with four other players for the two starting roles. The newly constructed right side of the offensive line played poorly in the first preseason game against the New England Patriots, but Allen showed enough improvement the following week against the Carolina Panthers to be named the starter going into the regular season.|$|E

5|$|Especially in warmer areas, {{the house}} sparrow may build its nests in the <b>open,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{branches}} of trees, especially evergreens and hawthorns, {{or in the}} nests of large birds such as storks or magpies. In open nesting sites, breeding success tends to be lower, since breeding begins late and the nest can easily be destroyed or damaged by storms. Less common nesting sites include street lights and neon signs, favoured for their warmth; and the old open-topped nests of other songbirds, which are then domed over.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} {{the site was}} <b>open</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first Saturday in April and October. Admission is free. There is a display on the Schmidt family in the house during each open house. In 2014, the White Sands Missile Range {{announced}} that due to budgetary constraints, the site would only be open once a year, on the first Saturday in April. In 2015, this decision was reversed, and two events were scheduled, in April and October.|$|E

5|$|The West Group {{consists}} of 21 structures on Terrace6, {{which was also}} artificially levelled. The structures are arranged around plazas that were left <b>open</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east side. Seven monuments {{have been found in}} this group. The West Group is bordered by the rivers Nima on the west and the San Isidro on the east. A notable find in the West Group was the discovery of some jade masks there. The West Group was occupied from the Late Preclassic through to at least the Late Classic.|$|E

5|$|Young {{birds have}} a yellowish-red gape. The feather follicles {{appear on the}} fourth day and pin {{feathers}} emerge after a week. Nestlings increase in weight steadily until they are 12 days old. The eyes <b>open</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eighth day, the iris reddish-black while the gape turns red. The young leave the nest after about 16 to 20 days after hatching. They do not have the fork in the tail until three weeks. The parents continue to feed and protect them for a month. Young birds may beg for food for longer, but are often ignored or chased away by the adults. Birds reach breeding condition in about two years.|$|E
5|$|American {{involvement}} in the Everglades began during the Second Seminole War (1836–42), a costly and very unpopular conflict. The United States spent between $30million and $40million and lost between 1,500 and 3,000lives. The U.S. military drove the Seminoles into the Everglades and were charged {{with the task of}} finding them, defeating them, and moving them to Oklahoma Indian territory. Almost 4,000Seminoles were killed in the war or were removed. The U.S. military was completely unprepared for the conditions they found in the Everglades. They tore their clothes on sawgrass, ruined their boots on the uneven limestone floor, and were plagued by mosquitoes. Soldiers' legs, feet, and arms were cut <b>open</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sawgrass and gangrene infection set in, taking many lives and limbs. Many died of mosquito-borne illness. After slogging through mud, one private died in his tracks of exhaustion in 1842. General Thomas Jesup admitted the military was overwhelmed by the terrain when he wrote to the Secretary of War in 1838, trying to dissuade him from prolonging the war.|$|E
5|$|As the {{sun rose}} on 14 September, pockets of Japanese {{soldiers}} remained scattered along {{both sides of the}} ridge. But with Tamura's battalion shattered after losing three-quarters of its officers and men, and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well, Kawaguchi's assault on the ridge had effectively ended. About 100 Japanese soldiers still remained in the <b>open</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south slope of Hill 80, perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill 123. At first light, three U.S. Army P-400 Airacobra fighters from the 67th Fighter Squadron at Henderson Field, acting on a request personally delivered by Bailey, strafed the Japanese near Hill 80 and killed most of them, with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle.|$|E

5|$|Following the German {{destroyer}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Collingwood and {{the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard the fleet flagship over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its night-time cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. Collingwood fired a total of 52 armour-piercing, capped and 32 HE shells from her main armament and 35 four-inch shells during the battle. Prince Albert was a sub-lieutenant commanding the forward turret during the battle and sat in the <b>open</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> turret roof during a lull in the action.|$|E
5|$|Sörenstam turned {{professional}} in 1992, but missed her LPGA Tour card {{at the final}} qualifying tournament by one shot, and began her professional career on the Ladies European Tour (LET), {{formerly known as the}} WPGET. She was invited to play in three LPGA Tour events in 1993, where she finished T38th, 4th, and T9th, earning more than $47,000. She finished second four times on the Ladies European Tour and was 1993 Ladies European Tour Rookie of the Year. By tying for 28th at the LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament she earned non-exempt status for the 1994 season. Sörenstam's first professional win came at the 1994 Holden Women's Australian <b>Open</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ALPG Tour.|$|E
5|$|The third {{practice}} session on Saturday morning was disrupted by two red flag periods. Twenty minutes into practice, Felipe Nasr {{lost control of}} his car when he weaved {{from side to side}} on track to increase his tyre temperatures while his drag reduction system (DRS) was <b>open</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first part of the Casino straight, and crashed into the barrier at the inside of the track. After the red flag was lifted, only twelve minutes of the session remained and all drivers took to the track to try out the super-soft compound. This did not last long however, as Jenson Button had to park his car at turn seven, reporting a problem with his power unit. This brought out the red flag once again, effectively ending the session. Nico Rosberg was fastest, half a second ahead of Räikkönen, while Hamilton drove just nine laps, ending the practice with the slowest time set.|$|E
