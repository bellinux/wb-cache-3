5000|$|When Company M, 1st U.S. Cavalry {{arrived in}} Yellowstone, Captain Moses Harris, a Civil War Medal of Honor recipient, {{on his own}} {{authority}} and initiative, promulgated {{a set of rules}} that his staff enforced to protect park resources still adhered to in the 21st century: 1) The cutting of green timber, or the removal or displacement of any mineral deposits or natural curiosities, is forbidden. 2) Hunting or trapping and the discharge of firearms within the limited of the Park is prohibited. Fishing is forbidden except with hook and line, and the sale of fish so taken is also disallowed. 3) Wagon tires on all wagons used for freighting purposes on roads ... are required to be a least four inches in width. 4) Camping parties will only build fires when actually necessary. 5) The sale of intoxicating liquors, except by hotel proprietors to their guests, for their own use, is strictly prohibited. 6) Trespassers within the Park for illicit purposes, or persons wantonly violating the foregoing rules, will be summarily removed from the Park. 8) No rocks, sticks, or other obstructions must be thrown into any of the springs or geysers within the park. ... It is enjoined upon all soldiers ... to be vigilant and attentive in the enforcement of the foregoing regulations. ... they will in the enforcement of their orders conduct themselves in a courteous and polite, but firm and decided manner. As quoted in How the U.S. Cavalry Saved <b>Our</b> <b>National</b> <b>Parks</b> Even though Harris and his soldiers vigilantly enforced the rules, arresting many violators, there was no legal authority for prosecution or punishment.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The {{significance}} of geology is commonly overlooked {{by the general}} public and underrepresented in free-choice learning environments including <b>national</b> <b>parks</b> that exhibit spectacular examples of geological features and processes. Parks are a major contributor to public learning, and a key way to teach how geology influences many aspects of <b>our</b> lives. Shenandoah <b>National</b> <b>Park</b> represents a snapshot of over a billion years of Earth's history. Phases of continental rifting and collision that formed the Appalachian Mountains reflect multiple "Wilson Cycles" of opening and closing ocean basins. Shenandoah's spectacular landscape is a product of past and ongoing geological processes that strongly influence the park's flora, fauna, and cultural history. Interpreting this landscape presents opportunities to increase public science literacy and draw attention to <b>national</b> <b>parks</b> as natural geological classrooms. By developing a geology-based training manual for Shenandoah <b>National</b> <b>Park</b> rangers, this thesis aims to increase ranger knowledge of the geological history of the Appalachian Mountains and thereby increase their ability to educate visitors about stories of the past, present, and future that these mountains have to tell. This thesis is the precursor to a condensed geology training manual for the interpretive staff at Shenandoah <b>National</b> <b>Park.</b> The thesis is intended as a more in-depth reference for park rangers to help them better understand the {{significance of}} Shenandoah's geology. Its format and content have been guided by the results of an informal survey of the park's interpretive staff and two seasons of employment with the <b>National</b> <b>Park</b> Service (NPS) as a Shenandoah interpretive ranger. The thesis is broken into five primary sections. The first two discuss the big-picture geological story of the Appalachian Mountains, putting the geology of Shenandoah <b>National</b> <b>Park</b> into a broader context. The third and fourth sections zoom in on Shenandoah, revealing specific links between the park's geologic features and other aspects of it's natural and cultural history. A final section reviews basic principles of NPS interpretation and discusses how park rangers can incorporate geology into their educational programs. As interpreters, <b>national</b> <b>park</b> rangers have the ability {{to bridge the gap between}} scientists and the general public. So often, important concepts that are explained by scientists do not reach the public because the public and the scientific community use two very different languages. Interpreters are the go-between. By speaking the language of both the scientist and the common public, interpreters can breach the language barrier and by doing so, greatly improve public science literacy, influence public policy, and increase environmental awareness. It is my hope that this thesis and the associated training manual will be used as an interpretive tool. By incorporating aspects of Shenandoah's fascinating geological story into their programs, park rangers can inspire the public to make intellectual and emotional connections to our country's natural history and its meanings. Ultimately, this will lead to greater appreciation and protection of <b>our</b> <b>national</b> <b>park</b> resources...|$|R
