5|$|On {{the east}} end of the roof, the church had a cupola which was topped with a large {{concrete}} pineapple. Pineapples were a feature of several buildings in Southampton as a symbol <b>of</b> <b>welcome,</b> an idea that originated in the Caribbean and which possibly reached the city {{as a result of the}} slave trade in the 16th century. The pineapple survived the bombing and has been used as an exhibited on special occasions, such as Black History Month.|$|E
5|$|Eager {{to spread}} {{information}} about Wicca throughout Britain, she {{also began to}} interact with press, sending a 1962 letter to the Spiritualist newspaper Psychic News, and in 1964 being interviewed for her involvement with Wicca by Brighton's Evening Argus. During the 1960s, she began producing articles about Wicca and other esoteric subjects on a regular basis, for such esoteric magazines as Light, Fate, and Prediction. In this capacity, she also began to make appearances on television and radio. She also involved herself in the newly formed Witchcraft Research Association (WRA), becoming its second President after the resignation of Sybil Leek. Valiente's letter <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> {{was included in the}} first issue of the WRA's newsletter, Pentagram, published in August 1964, while she also gave a speech at the WRA's Halloween dinner in October. It was at the speech that Valiente proclaimed the Wiccan Rede; this was its first public appearance in a recognisable form, with Doyle White arguing that it was Valiente herself who both created and named the Rede. It was through the WRA that Valiente came to communicate with the journalist Justine Glass, who was then conducting research for her book Witchcraft, the Sixth Sense, and Us.|$|E

5|$|In chapter 3, King Völsung {{is holding}} a {{marriage}} feast for his daughter Signy and King Siggeir at King Völsung's hall. At the hall, large fires are kindled in long hearths running {{the length of the}} hall, while {{in the middle of the}} hall stands the great tree Barnstokkr. That evening, while those attending the feast are sitting by the flaming hearths, they are visited by a one-eyed, very tall man whom they do not recognize. The stranger is wearing a hooded, mottled cape, linen breeches tied around his legs, and is barefooted. Sword in hand, the man walks towards Barnstokkr and his hood hangs low over his head, gray with age. The man brandishes the sword and thrusts it into the trunk of the tree, and the blade sinks to its hilt. Words <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> fail the crowd.|$|E
5|$|The {{last two}} stage plays Olivier {{directed}} were Jean Giradoux's Amphitryon (1971) and Priestley's Eden End (1974). By {{the time of}} Eden End, {{he was no longer}} director of the National Theatre; Peter Hall took over on 1 November 1973. The succession was tactlessly handled by the board, and Olivier felt that he had been eased out—although he had declared his intention to go—and that he had not been properly consulted about the choice of successor. The largest of the three theatres within the National's new building was named in his honour, but his only appearance on the stage of the Olivier Theatre was at its official opening by the Queen in October 1976, when he made a speech <b>of</b> <b>welcome,</b> which Hall privately described as the most successful part of the evening.|$|E
5|$|Week <b>of</b> <b>Welcome,</b> usually {{held the}} first or second week of the Fall {{semester}} holds many spirit events, such as Trail of the Torch. Trail of the Torch is another university tradition that has continued to grow annually, where a pep rally is held in the Housing Quad with music, food, giveaways and dancing. After the pep rally, the torch of knowledge is lit and blue and gold candles are distributed to the crowd for the procession around the campus, trailing the torch from the Housing Quad to the torch in front of the Primera Casa building. Rage Week and Homecoming Week are other major back-to-back spirit weeks held in the Fall semester. They include the Homecoming Parade, Greek Row parties, Homecoming football game, Blue/Gold Party, pep rallies and other Panther Rage events.|$|E

25|$|A Śvētāmbara {{initiation}} {{involves a}} procession {{in which the}} initiate symbolically disposes of his material wealth and makes donations. This is followed (or preceded) by another ritual in which the initiate receives an ogho (a small broom made of wool) from their mentor as a symbol <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> into the monastic order. The initiate then puts on monastic clothing and pluck out hairs by hand. Further rituals formally initiate them into the monastic order. The Śvētāmbara Terapanth sect requests written permission from a person's parents before initiating them into the ascetic order.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of the 99 {{responses}} to the survey show that the library {{is one of the}} last places that transgender people turn for information due to lack up to date health information, or an unwelcoming environment. Library collections meant to support the needs of transgender individuals were generally less comprehensive than those serving their gay and lesbian counterparts. The authors found that librarians should do more outreach to transgender communities to communicate a message <b>of</b> <b>welcome,</b> and that the internet could be a potentially powerful tool for outreach to these underrepresented populations.|$|E
