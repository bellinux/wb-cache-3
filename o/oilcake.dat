The {{demand for}} protein for {{human and animal}} {{nutrition}} in South Africa is increasing and it will continuously increase. The effect of replacing soybean <b>oilcake</b> meal as protein source for broilers and full-fat soybean meal for weaner pigs, with different levels of sweet lupins (Lupinus angustifolius), canola <b>oilcake</b> and full-fat canola was examined. A basal diet with soybean <b>oilcake</b> as protein source was mixed with a diet using either sweet lupins or canola <b>oilcake</b> or full-fat canola in ratios of 100 %, 67 % and 33 % respectively. In the broiler trial the test diets were fed {{for a period of}} six weeks with or without the enzyme Vegpro (Alltech). Pigs were fed the test diets, with and without Roxazyme® enzyme, ad libitum from 8. 5 to 25 kg live weight. The fatty acid content of the fat pads of the broilers raised on the different diets was determined. The pigs were kept in the trial up to the grower- finisher phase. The fatty acid content of the carcass fat and muscle of pigs raised on the different diets was determined. The inclusion of enzymes had no effect on the growth, feed intake or feed conversion ratio of broilers fed the test diets. The provision of external dietary enzymes to the weaner pig diets failed to improve either dry matter intake or growth rate, but improved the feed conversion ratio. Broiler weights at six weeks of age were significantly higher for the control diet compared to the 20 % lupin diet. There {{was no significant difference in}} the feed intake as the lupin content of the diets increased. The feed conversion ratio did not differ significantly between the control diet and the 6. 6 % lupin diet but became significantly poorer as the lupin content increased to 13. 2 % and 20 % of the test diet. There were no significant differences in production performance of the control diet and the canola <b>oilcake</b> containing diet. The broiler weights at six weeks decreased significantly with each increase in the canola <b>oilcake</b> content of the diets. The feed intake of the 20 % canola <b>oilcake</b> diet at week six was significantly less than the intake of the control diet, but not significantly less than the 6. 6 % and 13. 2 % canola <b>oilcake</b> diets. The feed conversion ratio of the control diet was significantly better than the 13. 2 % and 20 % canola <b>oilcake</b> diets. No significant differences were found in week six between the 6. 6 % full-fat canola diet and the control diet for broiler weights and feed intake. The feed conversion ratio of the broilers fed the 13. 2 % and 20 % full-fat canola diets was significantly poorer than the control diet. The final body weights of the weaner piglets fed the control diet were significantly higher than the final body weights of weaner piglets fed the lupin containing diets. The average daily gain of the weaner piglets fed the control diet was significantly higher than the gain of the weaner piglets fed the lupin containing diets. No significant differences in the feed intake and feed conversion ratio between the different lupin inclusion levels were detected. There were no significant differences in body weight, feed intake, average daily gain and the feed conversion ratio, between the various full-fat canola containing diets and the control diet. A significant difference in body weight was found between the weaner piglets fed the 20 % canola <b>oilcake</b> diet and the weaner piglets fed the control diet. There were no significant differences in feed intake between the various inclusion levels of canola <b>oilcake.</b> The control and 6. 6 % canola <b>oilcake</b> containing diets had significantly higher average daily gains than the 20 % canola <b>oilcake</b> containing diet. In the final trial the finisher pigs fed the test diet containing 25. 00 % lupins, had a final body weight significantly lighter than the final body weight of the finisher pigs fed the other test diets. The finisher pigs fed the test diet containing 25. 00 % lupins, also had a significantly reduced average daily gain and feed intake. The feed intake of the 25. 00 % canola <b>oilcake</b> diet was significantly lees than the feed intake of the 16. 75 % full-fat canola containing diet. The feed conversion ratio of the 25. 00 % lupin containing diet was significantly poorer than the feed conversion ratio of the 16. 75 % lupin containing diet, 8. 25 % lupin containing diet, 16. 75 % full-fat canola containing diet, 25. 00 % canola <b>oilcake</b> containing diet and the control diet. In a choice feeding trial growing pigs were offered four diets with four different protein sources: sweet lupins (25 % inclusion level), canola <b>oilcake</b> (25 % inclusion level), full-fat canola (25 % inclusion level) and soybean <b>oilcake</b> (25 % inclusion level), while their daily intakes were recorded. In a second choice feeding trial pigs were offered ten different diets with increasing levels (6. 6 %, 13. 2 %, 20 %) of either sweet lupins, canola <b>oilcake</b> meal or full-fat canola meal. The pigs consumed significantly more of the soybean <b>oilcake</b> containing diet compared to diets containing the alternative protein sources. Pigs consumed significantly less of the full-fat canola diet compared to the sweet lupin and canola <b>oilcake</b> diets. Ten different canola cultivars were collected from two different locations in the Mediterranean rainfall area of South Africa namely the Western Cape (Swartland) and Southern Cape (Rûens) grain producing areas. The sinapine and glucosinolate content of various canola cultivars was compared and the influence of locality on the sinapine and glucosinolate content of the canola cultivars was determined. There were no significant differences (P < 0. 05) in sinapine content when the canola produced in the Western and Southern Cape were compared. Varola 54 and Rainbow cultivars had significantly higher (P < 0. 05) sinapine contents compared to the Varola 50 cultivar. Samples of lupins, field peas, faba beans and narbon beans were collected and analysed for amino acids, alkaloids, non-starch polysaccharides, tannin and starch. The digestible energy value of these alternative protein sources for pigs was determined. Significant differences were found in the amino acid content of the various crops. The alkaloid content of the lupins varied significantly between the sweet and bitter lupin varieties. Sweet L. angustifolius cultivars contained ca 50 mg/kg and the bitter L. angustifolius cultivars ca 15000 mg/kg alkaloids. The mean alkaloid content of L. albus cultivars was ca 1300 mg/kg.

In medicine and in traditional pharmacopeia, these parts are used in the treatment of several diseases. Shea is also valued at the cultural,nutritional, agricultural, cosmetic, artisanal level...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} sorghum stover fodder quality in densified total mixed ration (DTMR) feed blocks was investigated. An experimental feed block {{with a low}} cost stover was compared with a commercial feed block produced by Miracle Feeds and Fodder Pvt. Ltd. that consisted of a premium sorghum stover (about 50 %) and concentrate in equal proportions. Concentrate component consisted of bran and husks/hulls (18 %), <b>oilcakes</b> (18 %), molasses (8 %) with the rest contributed by maize grain, urea, minerals and vitamins. In the experimental DTMR feed block the premium stover was replaced by low cost stover and rest of the composition was same. The two blocks were fed ad libitum to growing sheep measuring intake, digestibility and weight gain. No difference was observed in digestibility between the groups fed the commercial and the experimental block. Intake in the group fed the commercial block was 37 g/kg LW compared to 32. 8 g/kg LW in the experimental block group (P= 0. 07). Daily live weight gain in the former group was twice that of the latter (90 vs. 45 g; P= 0. 04). However, both feeding regimes were uneconomical, with the experimental feeding regime even resulting in monetary loss...|$|R

40|$|Magister Commercii - MComOilseed is {{the third}} most {{important}} export item in Ethiopian foreign trade. It has registered a high export growth rate over recent years {{both in terms of}} volume and value. Besides its growing share in export, it is widely used for the extraction of edible oil and <b>oilcake</b> that is supplied to the domestic market. Although farmers are the primary producers of oilseeds, they are not able to benefit from the growing market share of the product {{due to the fact that}} they find themselves at the end of an extended market chain. As a result they only receive a very small proportion of what the final buyers are paying for the oilseed products. In addition, there is not much experience on the part of the farmers to process oilseeds, change it to edible oil and <b>oilcake</b> and retain the value addition in the local economy. This thesis used the value chain approach to investigate the possibilities for the primary producers to increase their income share from the selling of their products either by directly selling to exporters or by processing oilseeds, producing edible oil and <b>oilcake,</b> and retaining the value addition in the local economy.

40|$|Development and {{introduction}} of new types of bakery products with increased nutritional value {{is one of the}} basic and urgent problems in the bakery industry. The solution of it is the use of whole grains, as well as secondary products of their processing. The use of by-products of wheat germ (oil, <b>oilcake,</b> <b>oilcake</b> flour), which are rich in proteins and enhances the nutritional value of products {{is considered to be a}} promising area in the bakery industry. At the same time the program objectives products, developed in the framework of the "Strategy of development of the food processing industry of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2020 "products, are expanding the production of cereal-based foods, and involving of secondary resources in the economy. These technologies are re-source efficient. They allow efficient use of by-products raw materials of the milling industry. The process for the preparation of grain bread on the basis of a thick sourdough from bioactivated wheat grain is known. However, despite all the advantages of grain breads with high amounts of dietary fiber, minerals and vitamins, they exhibit low levels of protein and lysine deficiency. At present larger preference is given to the raw materials of natural origin (millet, buckwheat and oatmeal flours, fruit puree, whole grains, oil, flour and wheat germ flakes, and etc.) for foods enrichment in modern food science. Products of processing of wheat germ: oil, flakes, <b>oilcake</b> and oil-cake flour are widely used in bakery technology. To improve the nutritional value flour from wheat germ <b>oilcake</b> was used in the work. In the course of the research its positive effect on the quality of semi-finished and finished products was found. They differed from the control sample in a high content of antioxidants and better digestibility of proteins bread crumb...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Taking {{into account}} the {{environmental}} impacts of biofuel production is essential to develop new and innovative low-emission processes. The assessment of life cycle GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emissions of biofuel is mandatory for the countries of the European Union. New biomass resources that hardly compete with food crops are been developed increasingly. Microalgae are an interesting alternative to terrestrial biomass thanks to their high photosynthetic efficiency and their ability to accumulate lipids. This article provides an analysis of potential environmental impacts of the production of algal biofuel for aviation using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Evaluated impacts are GHG emissions and the primary energy consumption, from extraction of raw materials to final waste treatment. This study compared two management choices for <b>oilcakes</b> generated after oil extraction from microalgae. In the first system, these cakes are treated by energetic allocation and in the second by anaerobic digestion. In both cases, the steps of cultivation and harvesting have the highest impact on the results. Sensitivity analyzes are performed on technical choices of operat-ing systems (choice of the type of nutrients, mode of harvesting, drying and oil extraction) as well as aMonte-Carlo analysis on key parameter values for GHG emissions (concentration of microalgae in ponds, productivity and oil content). The results highlight the impact of the use of chemical fertilizer...|$|R

40|$|According to {{nutritional}} recommendations, humans should consume 1. 8 g/day of {{alpha-linolenic acid}} (ALA) {{and have a}} dietary linoleic acid (LA) to ALA ratio of less than 4. However, in France, mean ALA consumption is 0. 9 g/day, and the mean dietary LA:ALA ratio is greater than 9. These trends {{are linked to the}} lower levels of ALA found in animal products currently on the market. To generate products containing recommended ALA levels and LA:ALA ratios, we should increase the amount of grass in the diets of ruminant livestock, give non-ruminant livestock greater access to grasslands, and provide all livestock with dietary supplements such as rapeseed <b>oilcakes</b> and flaxseed. However, to fully meet nutritional recommendations, consumers also need to make global changes to their diets in terms of the animal products and oils they eat. Here, we provide clear guidelines that consumers can follow {{to improve the quality of}} their diets and balance their intake of polyunsaturated fats. They involve eating foods produced in certain quality marks (e. g., via organic farming), favoring grass-fed products and certain types of edible oils. En nutrition humaine, les recommandations nutritionnelles sont pour l'ALA (acide alpha-linolénique) de 1, 8 g/j et pour le rapport LA (acide linoléique) /ALA de moins de 4, alors que la moyenne française est respectivement de 0, 9 g/j et plus de 9. Les produits animaux des élevages contemporains ont une faible teneur en ALA. L'augmentation de la part de l'herbe dans la ration (ruminants) ou l'accès à un parcours herbeux (monogastriques) avec utilisation de lin et de tourteau de colza permet de se rapprocher des recommandations pour la teneur en ALA et le rapport LA / ALA des produits.
