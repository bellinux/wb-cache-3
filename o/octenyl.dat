The antimicrobial activities of OSA-g-EPLs were also examined, and the minimum inhibitory concentrations of OSA-g-EPLs against Escherichia coli O157:H7 remained {{the same as that}} of EPL. Therefore, modified EPLs have the potential of becoming bifunctional molecules, which can be used either as surfactants or emulsifiers in the encapsulation of water-insoluble drugs or as antimicrobial agents.|$|E
40|$|The aim {{of present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of emulsifying starches used as additives in breadmaking. In order to achieve this, the partial replacement (5 - 10 %) of wheat flour with starch sodium <b>octenyl</b> succinate (OSA starch), pregelatinized starch sodium <b>octenyl</b> succinate (Pregel OSA starch) and hydrolyzed spray-dried starch sodium <b>octenyl</b> succinate (Hydrol OSA starch) was performed. The quality characteristics of obtained bread were compared to control wheat flour bread and bread containing 0. 5 % hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC). The obtained results indicated that addition of Pregel and OSA starches influenced the increase in water absorption, whilst addition of Hydrol OSA starch exhibited the opposite effect. Moreover, the addition of all chosen starches influenced the decrease in dough stability.

40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{the effects of}} concurrent ball milling (BM) and <b>octenyl</b> succinic anhydride (OSA) modification on the starch microstructure and physicochemical properties (swelling, emulsifying, and rheological). Unlike normal OSA-modified starches, the BM/OSA-modified starch displayed new features such as reduced viscosity and rigidity but increased paste stability during shearing, heating and cooling, regardless of the substitution degree. More interestingly, while the physicochemical properties could be regulated by simply altering the BM treatment time, BM/OSA was more efficient and effective at modulating starch properties during the initial period (approx. 10 h), as seen by the rapid evolutions in starch structural disruption and OSA esterification. Thus, the BM/OSA modification {{can serve as a}} viable and cost-effective approach for producing <b>octenyl</b> succinate starches where low viscosity (at relatively high concentrations) and high paste stability are desired...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The <b>octenyl</b> succinate starch is a stabilization-modified starch {{produced}} by esterification of native starch with <b>octenyl</b> succinic anhydride (OSA). When modified {{in this way}} the starch tends to improve its functional characteristics, can be used to tailor starch to specific food applications. Therefore, optimization of reaction conditions of <b>octenyl</b> succinate starch is critical for modification. The preparation of OSA starches from potato starch in an aqueous alkaline solution was investigated. The reaction conditions, including reaction temperature, OSA concentration, concentration of starch slurry, reaction time and pH, were studied and optimized, as they influence esterification. Under the optimization conditions, the degree of substitution (DS) could reach 0. 01862. The products were confirmed by the presence of the carbonxylate signal around 1558 cm- 1 in the fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra. By scanning electron microscope (SEM), OSA starch granules were proved to transfer to some smaller anomalistic ellipses and had slight rough on their surfaces. X-ray diffraction showed that esterification occurred primarily in the amorphous regions and the crystalline pattern of starches did not change. The thermal characteristics of the OSA starch were studied by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). TGA revealed that the OSA starch were thermally more stable than the native starch. The OSA starch exhibited 50 % weight loss at 320 °C, while the native starch underwent 50 % weight loss at 312 °C. The DSC results showed that amorphous region increased after esterification...|$|E
40|$|<b>Octenyl</b> succinate {{starches}} {{are commonly}} used as emulsifiers and texturizing agents in many food-systems. Rice, tapioca, corn, wheat and potato starches were modified with <b>octenyl</b> succinic anhydride (OSA) at 3 % level. Structural characterization, molecular weight, starch digestibility and physical properties of starch granule stabilized emulsions were studied for modified starches. Modified potato (0. 022) and wheat (0. 018) starches had the highest and lowest degrees of OSA substitution, respectively. For all starches, amylose and amylopectin molecular mass was significantly (P < 0. 05) lower for OSA starches. OSA modification may have hydrolyzed the small amylose and amylopectin chains, or caused rearrangement of the starch molecules. Although the starch modification improved emulsification properties, botanical source showed more influence on this parameter. Overall, botanical source had more influence on functional properties than degree of substitution.

40|$|A {{series of}} alkenylated inulin samples were {{synthesized}} {{in aqueous solution}} using alkenyl succinic anhydrides with varying alkenyl chain lengths (C 8 –C 18). The inulin derivatives (ASA–inulins) were characterized using NMR and FTIR and their degree of substitution determined. The solution properties of ASA–inulins were investigated using dye solubilization, surface tension, and dynamic light scattering, and all three techniques confirmed that the molecules aggregated in solution above a critical concentration (critical aggregation concentration, CAC). The value of the CAC {{was found to be}} reasonably consistent between the different techniques and was shown to decrease with increasing alkenyl chain length, from 0. 08 % for the <b>octenyl</b> succinylated sample to 0. 005 % for the octadecenyl succinylated sample. The hydrodynamic diameter of ASA–inulins above the CAC was determined from dynamic light scattering studies and was shown to increase with alkenyl chain length, from 4 nm for the <b>octenyl</b> derivative to 55 nm for the hexadecenyl derivative. All ASA–inulins were shown to be able to produce oil-in-water emulsions with a droplet size similar to that of emulsions prepared using Tween 20 on storing for 21 days.

The presence of SSOS provided important hints on particle formation and confirmed that submicronic particles resulted from nanocrystals oriented aggregation. The formation kinetics of layered structures was followed by SEM observations, suggesting that they result from a rapid aggregation of about 40 nm primary nanoparticles followed by rearrange into organized layered structures.

Analyses of the chemical composition, titratable acidity, water-holding capacity (WHC), yield, texture, microstructure, and electrophoretic profile of casein were conducted. Fat reduction increased the hardness and decreased the yield of the cheeses. Fat reduction also promoted a denser microstructure and less proteolysis. The concentration of starch that was added was insufficient to improve the yield and texture parameters of the reduced-fat cheese.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the rheological, pasting, and thermal properties of <b>octenyl</b> succinic anhydrate (OSA) -modified potato starch. Potato starch was modified using different concentrations of OSA (0, 1, 3, and 5 %, v/v). The degree of substitution (DS) for the OSA-modified starch ranged from 0. 0012 to 0. 0055. The amylose leaching values of native and OSA-modified potato starch with different DS levels were in the range of 47. 09 - 87. 32 %. The gel strength values of the OSA-modified starch were lower than those of native potato starch. Rapid Visco Analyzer data showed that peak, hot pasting, final and setback viscosities of the native starch decreased after OSA modification. Dynamic shear rheological tests, conducted at 4 °C, indicated that OSA-modified potato starch had weak gel-like behavior with the storage moduli (G') higher than the loss moduli (G”) over most of the frequency ranges (0. 63 - 63. 8 rad·s- 1) ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we studied}} the {{adsorption}} at emulsion droplets of potato starch, which was hydrophobically modified with <b>octenyl</b> succinate anhydride (OSA), a surface active macromolecule containing ultrahigh molar mass components. The {{results show that}} the substance works as an efficient emulsifier and that it can in some cases generate high surface loads (10 mg/m(2)). The results can be explained as an interplay between kinetic factors during the formation of the emulsion and the physical-chemical properties of the hydrophobically modified starch, such as the degree of substitution, molar mass, and radius. In turbulent flow fields, such as in a high-pressure homogenizer, the mass transport to the interface favors the adsorption of larger molecules as they are transported more rapidly to the interface. The larger molecules are also likely to have a higher substituent density and adsorption energy than smaller ones. This in turn is likely to give high surface loads and strengthen the effect of kinetic adsorption factors, as the large molecules will be overrepresented at the surface...|$|E

The gel hardness was higher with lower degree of substitution (DS) but lower with higher DS OSA compared to native starch. The swelling volumes (SV) of rice and wheat OSA starches were significantly higher compared to native starch, but the SV of potato OSA starch was slightly lower at high DS. The gelatinization temperature (GT) of rice OSA starches was sharply lower at low DS; for wheat OSA starch it was slightly lower even at high DS, but potato OSA starches had higher GT than the native starch.

The heat treated starch granules had a poor stabilizing ability and only the starch heated for the longest time (150 min at 120 [degree]C) had a better emulsifying capacity than the un-modified native starch granules. The effect of salt concentration was rather limited. However, an increased concentration of salt slightly increased the mean drop size and the elastic modulus...|$|E
40|$|Particle-stabilized emulsions, called Pickering emulsions, can be {{produced}} by using starch particles. In this work we studied how {{the properties of the}} starch particles affect the droplet size and creaming of such emulsions. In the study, various sizes of starch particles were generated by two different methods and used to stabilize Pickering emulsions. Sedimentation according to Stokes’ law was used to separate small and large starch granules. Acid hydrolysis was another method used to obtain smaller particles. All samples were modified with <b>octenyl</b> succinic anhydride (OSA) to increase their hydrophobicity with a level of OSA substitution between 1. 8 and 3. 1 %. The size of starch particles was the main factor influencing emulsion droplet sizes. Furthermore, the droplet size decreased as the starch concentration increased. Using small starch particles with sizes 10 μm. When subjected to acid hydrolysis, smaller starch particles were generally obtained, which could subsequently create smaller emulsion droplets. The emulsion index increased for the acid-hydrolyzed starch owing to the size reduction of starch particles. The shape of the starch seemed to have a minor impact on the droplet size and the creaming of Pickering emulsions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Octenyl</b> succinic {{anhydride}} modified starches (OSA-starches) {{are widely used}} as emulsifiers and stabilizers in the food industry. Selection of optimal OSA-starches for a given application would be facilitated with {{better understanding of the}} relations between performance and molecular structure, and the mechanistic reasons for observed correlations. Structural parameters, including molecular size distribution, chain-length distribution, degree of branching, degree of substitution (DS) and amount of small molecules such as maltose, were characterized using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC, also termed GPC) and H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and were correlated with the functional properties of viscosity, emulsion droplet size and emulsion stability. The observed correlations varied with the methods used to make the OSA-starch, which affects gross structural features. The viscosity of OSA-starch solutions was related to starch molecular size and the relative amounts of small molecules; the DS showed positive correlation with viscosity. Emulsion droplet size is mainly determined by the whole molecular size of the OSA-starch. Emulsion stabilization efficacy is mainly affected by the average chain length. These correlations can be rationalized by basic precepts of the behaviour of polymer chains in solution and the fundamentals of electrosteric stabilization...|$|E
40|$|Sodium (salt) was {{encapsulated}} {{within the}} inner water phase of w 1 /o/w 2 food emulsions externally stabilised by starch particles {{with the ultimate}} aim of enhancing saltiness perception. The physical properties of the starch particles were modified by <b>octenyl</b> succinic anhydride (OSA) treatment (0 - 3 %) to vary the degree of hydrophobicity of the emulsifying starch. During oral processing native salivary amylase hydrolysed the starch and destabilised the o/w emulsion releasing the inner w/o phase and subsequently sodium into the oral cavity, resulting in a salty taste. Whilst increasing OSA treatment levels increased {{the stability of the}} emulsion, intermediate or low levels of starch modification resulted in enhanced saltiness. It is therefore proposed that 1. 5 % OSA modified starch is optimal for sodium delivery and 2 % OSA modified starch is optimal for sodium delivery in systems that require greater process stability. It is also shown that sodium release was further enhanced by oral processing and was positively correlated with native amylase activity. The results demonstrate a promising new approach for the reduction of salt or sugar in emulsion based foods...|$|E
