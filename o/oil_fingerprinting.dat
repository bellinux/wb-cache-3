40|$|This thesis {{had been}} given the mandate of {{applying}} GCxGC coupled with different types of universal and selective detectors, such as flame ionisation detector (FID), quadrupole mass spectrometer (qMS), time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS), nitrogen-phosphorous detector (NPD) and electron capture detector (ECD)) for the analysis of various applications, including crude oils, incense smoke, particulate matters and unresolved complex mixtures (UCM). Through the experiments and findings presented in this thesis, it is proven that, once the GCxGC method is fully optimised, it approaches the attributes of the ultimate technique that could potentially provides a complete characterization of crude oil, UCM and many other complex samples, such as smoke generated during the incense burning process. The “inverted-phase” column combination (polar – non-polar) has been employed to provide an alternative and often improved separation in GCxGC. Additionally, it also significantly improves the separation of classes of non-polar compounds, which offers the possibility of facile and rapid <b>oil</b> <b>fingerprinting,</b> as well as sample comparison. A series of biodegraded oils ranging from whole crude oil to heavily biodegraded oils have been investigated by using the polar – non-polar column configuration. The results showed that different classes of compounds hidden under the UCM were separated from each other to form a number of bands on the 2 D plot. This technique was also employed for the application of incense smoke with the use of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) as a rapid and simple extraction method for the extraction of volatile compounds in both incense powder and smoke. The results obtained from this study showed that most of the compounds that are emitted into the atmosphere were generated during the combustion of incense. Moreover, various selective detectors, including TOFMS, NPD and ECD were also employed as tools for the analysis of nitrogen-containing and halogenated compounds in incense smoke. Overall, GCxGC has been successfully used as a new innovative tool for close to complete profiling analysis of UCM and incense smoke. This therefore strongly supports the proposal that GCxGC must be the method of choice for the analysis of complex environmental samples...|$|E

40|$|Preparing a {{defensible}} <b>oil</b> spill <b>fingerprinting</b> {{is always}} challenging. Presently available well established method {{for this purpose}} is a univariate method by comparison of diagnostic ratio using repeatability limit as suggested by European Committee for Standardization (CEN) -method. The consistency result of this method, however, tends {{to depend on the}} skill of the analyst who performs the analysis. The shortcoming of CEN-method was then demonstrated by the application of the method to the "MS Server" and "MV Full City" oil spill cases. The author s analysis result exposed some discrepancieswhen was compared with the one performed by SINTEF. Therefore, this thesis focuses on the effort of pursuing alternative or at least complimentary methods to ease the shortcoming of the CEN-method. The main investigation was then emphasized on the possibility of employing the multivariate analyses, i. e. principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis, and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The performance of those multivariate analyses were examined by applying to the case studies of "MS Server" and "MV Full City" oil spills. Later on, it was found that PCA failed to classify the samples properly according to the match or non-match with the reference samples. The power of the PCA was revealed when the method was combined with thecluster analysis. The PCA combined with the cluster analysis demonstrated to be faster and undoubtedly more objective (in term of the analyst skill and expertise) as compared to the CEN-method. PLS-DA also showed the same benefits. Moreover, the PLS-DA gives more similar result to the CEN-method applied by SINTEF (irrespective of the difference gaps of the analysts skill, i. e. the SINTEF researchers v. s. the author) as compared to the PCA combined with the cluster analysis. However, the main drawback of the PLS-DA is therequirement of quite large number of sample to obtain a good result.

40|$|Abstract. Commingling is {{employed}} in the petroleum industry to enhance oil recovery and reduce costs. It is of great importance to monitor the production of each oil well oilfields. Nowadays, more and more oilfields use chromatographic fingerprint to estimate single-zone production allocation. In order to insure the efficiency and affectivity of the commingled oil well exploiting, the productivity contribution of every single layer must be acquainted. Kernel partial least squares (KPLS) is a promising regression method for tackling nonlinear systems because it can efficiently compute regression coefficients in high-dimensional feature spaces by means of nonlinear kernel functions. Unlike other nonlinear partial least squares (PLS) techniques KPLS does not entail any nonlinear optimization procedures and has a complexity {{similar to that of}} linear PLS. Using the technology of crude <b>oil</b> chromatography <b>fingerprint,</b> an algorithm for predicting productivity contribution based on KPLS is proposed. The validity of the method is proved by laboratory artificial experiments. The maximum absolute error of predicted and real proportion is less than 10 %.

JonesPoor {{air quality}} in {{commercial}} aircraft cabins {{can be caused}} by volatile organophosphorus (OP) compounds emitted from the jet engine bleed air system during smoke/fume incidents. Tri-cresyl phosphate (TCP), a common anti-wear additive in turbine engine oils, is an important component in today’s global aircraft operations. However, exposure to TCP increases risks of certain adverse health effects. This research analyzed used aircraft cabin air filters for jet engine oil contaminants and designed a jet engine bleed air simulator (BAS) to replicate smoke/fume incidents caused by pyrolysis of jet engine oil. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) with X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and neutron activation analysis (NAA) were used for elemental analysis of filters, and gas chromatography interfaced with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to analyze used filters to determine TCP isomers. The filter analysis study involved 110 used and 74 incident filters. Clean air filter samples exposed to different bleed air conditions simulating cabin air contamination incidents were also analyzed by FESEM/EDS, NAA, and GC/MS. Experiments were conducted on a BAS at various bleed air conditions typical of an operating jet engine so that the effects of temperature and pressure variations on jet engine oil aerosol formation could be determined. The GC/MS analysis of both used and incident filters characterized tri-m-cresyl phosphate (TmCP) and tri-p-cresyl phosphate (TpCP) by a base peak of an m/z = 368, with corresponding retention times of 21. 9 and 23. 4 minutes. The hydrocarbons in jet oil were characterized in the filters by a base peak pattern of an m/z = 85, 113. Using retention times and hydrocarbon thermal conductivity peak (TCP) pattern obtained from jet engine oil standards, five out of 110 used filters tested had oil markers. Meanwhile 22 out of 74 incident filters tested positive for <b>oil</b> <b>fingerprints.</b> Probit analysis of jet engine oil aerosols obtained from BAS tests by optical particle counter (OPC) revealed lognormal distributions with the mean (range) of geometric mass mean diameter (GMMD) = 0. 41 (0. 39, 0. 45) [mu]m and geometric standard deviation (GSD), [sigma][subscript]g = 1. 92 (1. 87, 1. 98). FESEM/EDS and NAA techniques found a wide range of elements on filters, and further investigations of used filters are recommended using these techniques. The protocols for air and filter sampling and GC/MS analysis used in this study will increase the options available for detecting jet engine oil on cabin air filters. Such criteria could support policy development for compliance with cabin air quality standards during incidents...|$|R

Combining optical and wetting functions in multifunctional materials is critical for practical engineering applications such as energy harvesting, color generation, and operation of optical instrumentation in humid conditions. However, analyses of the functional design constraints of specified optical and wetting functions followed by integrative optimization have been rare, and limited to simple pairwise combinations from two distinct research disciplines. Furthermore, fabricating the desired multifunctional nanostructured materials remains a difficult engineering challenge due to the limitations of existing nanofabrication methods. The work in this thesis focuses on the joint control of light transport and surface wettability. It starts with analysis and design, followed by implementation of new multifunctional nanostructured materials using novel nanolithographic fabrication techniques. We first consider multifunctional silica surfaces consisting of conical nanostructures (nanocones) for enhanced omnidirectional broadband transmissivity in conjunction with structural superhydrophilicity or robust superhydrophobicity. This is achieved through a systematic approach to concurrent design of nanostructures in both domains and an innovative fabrication procedure that achieves the desired aspect-ratios and periodicities in the nanocones with few defects, high feature repeatability, and large pattern area. Enhanced optical transmissivity exceeding 98 % has been achieved over a broad bandwidth and range of incident angles independent of the polarization state. These nanotextured surfaces also demonstrate robust anti-fogging or self-cleaning properties, offering potential benefits for applications such as photovoltaic solar cells. As an extended function of this silica nanocone surface, we propose the systematic design and development of nanostructured transparent anti-fingerprint surface coatings that degrade <b>fingerprint</b> <b>oils</b> using photocatalytic effects. The TiO₂-based porous nanoparticle surfaces exhibit short timescales for decomposition of <b>fingerprint</b> <b>oils</b> under ultraviolet light, plus they have transparency comparable to typical glass with low optical haze (< 1 %), and are mechanically robust. These TiO₂ nanostructured surfaces are anti-fogging, anti-bacterial, compatible with flexible glass substrates, and remain photocatalytically active in natural sunlight Lastly, instead of eliminating all reflections over the broadband wavelengths of light for enhanced super-transmissivity, 2 -dimensional (2 D) periodic nanorod surfaces capable of generating vivid colors by wavelength-selective reflection have also been designed and developed. The geometry of the nanorod structures on top of a silicon substrate is optimized to obtain high contrast of colors while still allowing for scalable nanopatterning with the help of newly invented nanofabrication processes. By developing an integrated understanding of optical and wetting properties of nanostructured materials, {{we have been able to}} realize novel functionalities using nanostructured surfaces conceived by concurrent design in the two domains and created by new nanofabrication techniques. by Hyungryul Choi.

Mangroves harbour a large diversity of organisms, including microorganisms with important roles in nutrient cycling and availability. Due to tidal influence, mangroves are sites where crude oil from spills farther away can accumulate. The relationship between mangrove bacterial diversity and oil degradation in mangrove sediments remains poorly understood.

40|$|In this thesis, {{known and}} new iridium(III) cyclometalated {{complexes}} have been synthesized and investigated in a host-guest chemical context and in studies towards an application in {{the detection of}} peroxide-based explosives in fingerprints. The complexes [Ir(ppy-R) 2 (bpy) ]n+ studied here contain two cyclometalated ligands (ppy-R: R-substituted 2 -phenylpyridine), and one polypyridine ligand (bpy= 2, 2 -bipyridine). Substituent groups R included: R=H (Ir-H); R=CHO (Ir-CHO); R=CH 2 NH-Bu, Bu=n-butylamine, (Ir-CH 2 NH-Bu); R=CH 2 NH-Oct, Oct=n-octylamine (Ir-CH 2 NH-Oct); and R=CH 2 N-(Oct) 2 (Ir-CH 2 N-(Oct) 2). Chapter 2 demonstrated that the R group in the iridium(III) complexes significantly affects the photophysical properties. Luminescence and electrochemical studies confirmed that the CHO group acts as a strong electron withdrawing group (EWG), while Ir-CH 2 NH-Bu was more like Ir-H, as the n-butyl group (Bu) behaved as a mild EWG rather than an electron donating group (EDG). Ir-CHO and Ir-H both showed similar responses to solvent polarity, but the response of Ir-CH 2 NH-Bu was opposite to that observed for Ir-CHO and Ir-H. In the iridium alkylamine complexes, Ir-CH 2 N-(Oct) 2 displayed different emission properties from Ir-CH 2 NH-Bu and Ir-CH 2 NH-Oct. In the host-guest study reported in Chapter 3, all complexes (Ir-CHO, Ir-H and Ir-CH 2 NH 2 +-Bu) showed a similar accommodation mode within Q[10], where the ppy-R ligands sat deep within the cavity while the bpy ligand sat on the portal. In the presence of Q[10] the emission profiles of these complexes showed enhanced intensity with blue shifts and became more structured. The titration study showed that both Ir-CHO and Ir-H had similar binding behavior (1 : 2 portal bound and 1 : 1 cavity bound) while Ir-CH 2 NH 2 +-Bu only displayed 1 : 1 cavity bound associations. The emissions of encapsulated complexes {{were found to be}} very sensitive to temperature. In Chapter 4 this type of Ir(III) cyclometalated complex was applied toward a detection application for both fingerprints and peroxide-based explosives in the <b>oil</b> of <b>fingerprints.</b> Ir-CH 2 N-(Oct) 2 displayed the highest solubility in oleic acid (as an example of fatty acid that present in fingerprints). A boronic acid group (B(OH) 2) was introduced to the bpy ligand to form B(OH) 2 -Ir-H, which was used as a sensor for peroxide detection, based on the ability of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) to oxidize a boronic acid group and hence induce a change in the luminescence...|$|R
40|$|The Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR)  was {{applied for}} the {{discrimination}} of butter samples adulterated with solid fraction of palm <b>oil.</b> For FTIR <b>fingerprinting</b> of butter samples, with or without controlled additions of palm oil as adulterant was firstly obtained, using a Shimatsu Prestige 21 Spectrophotometer, including a horizontal diamond ATR accessory with reflection in the MIR region (3873 - 690) cm - 1. The spiked butter samples including 0 level and seven increasing concentrations of palm fats, up to 50 % were fingerprinted and the calibration curve was obtained (n= 19). In parallel, the validation was realized using different set of spiked butter samples ranging 1 - 44. 4 % of palm fat (n= 7). Finally, an independent set of commercial samples was analized (n= 14). Partial least squares (PLS) model was used for statistical data processing in accordance with standard method. The value of the correlation coefficient (R 2 = 0. 977) between actual and predicted values was statistically significant (p< 0. 001), considering the superposition of  "actual vs predicted” curves. This combined FTIR-PLS evaluation revealed that 3 out of  samples of butter were suspected of adulteration with palm oil, presented values 14 ranging 4 - 12 %. In conclusion, ATR-FTIR methodology may offer an rapid evaluation of  butter samples authenticity. The low value for detection limit (3 %palm oil in butter) and the low limit of quantification (9. 8 % palm oil in butter) confirms that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy  is a sensitive method to identify the adulteration of butter with  palm oil.    </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{preservative}} potential of Megaphrynium macrostachyum on fungi responsible for the deterioration of orange juice and corn Jell-O. The phytochemicals from plants’ leaves were extracted with four solvents: acetone, aqueous, ethanol and hexane. The solvents were differently and tested against fungi isolated from orange juice and corn Jell-O using disc diffusion method. Phytochemical screening of the extracts from the leaves was carried out, and the most active extract was tested via GC-MS for the essential <b>oils</b> and HPLC <b>fingerprinting.</b> The toxicity test of the extracts against brine shrimp was carried out after exposure for 24 hours. The toxicity test showed that the extracts were non-toxic on the Brine Shrimps at LC 50 (379. 21 μg/ml and 107. 21 μg/ml for aqueous and ethanol extracts). The qualitative phytochemical test reported the presence of alkaloids, tannins, saponins, flavonoids, steroids, and terpenoids in different extracts of the plant’ leaves. The quantitative phytochemical determination {{of the most active}} extract revealed alkaloids with the highest contents of 107. 48 mg/ 100 g. The GC-MS analyses of the fresh leaves of the plants revealed the presence of isodecane with the highest percentage at 15. 56 %. The GC-MS analyses of the dried leaves revealed isodecane with the highest percentage at 10. 43 %. The HPLC analysis revealed the presence of various phytochemical constituents in the dried leaves. This study has been able to establish the potency of Megaphrynium macrostachyum leaves on fungi associated with the spoilage of Citrus sinensis (orange) juice and Corn Jell-O (‘Eko’) which contribute to tremendous research towards the use and acknowledgment of natural antimicrobials for the preservation of food...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that petroleum and source rocks are enriched in Pt and Pd to the ppb level, {{and that the}} 187 Os/ 188 Os composition coupled with the Pt/Pd value permits the fingerprinting of petroleum to its source. Oils from the United Kingdom Atlantic Margin (sourced from the Upper Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay Fm.) as well as source rock samples have been analysed for Pt and Pd. When the Pt/Pd value is compared with 187 Os/ 188 Os (calculated {{at the time of}} oil generation; Osg) the values from both the known source and the oils are similar, demonstrating that they can be used as an <b>oil</b> to source <b>fingerprinting</b> tool. This inorganic petroleum fingerprinting tool is particularly important in heavily biodegraded petroleum systems where traditional fingerprinting techniques (e. g. biomarkers) are severely hampered, e. g. the world's largest oil sand deposit, the West Canadian Oil Sands (WCOS). This has caused the source of the WCOS to be hotly debated, with no present day consensus between inputs from potential source units e. g. Exshaw and Gordondale Fms. 187 Os/ 188 Os and Pt/Pd <b>fingerprinting</b> of the <b>oil</b> sands shows {{that the majority of the}} petroleum have similar 187 Os/ 188 Os and Pt/Pd values, supporting the hypothesis of one principal source. Analysis of the potential source rocks establishes that the principal source of the oil sands to be from the Jurassic Gordondale Fm., with a minor Exshaw Fm. input. Thus, the combination of previously pioneered Re–Os petroleum geochronology with 187 Os/ 188 Os and Pt/Pd values of petroleum permits both a temporal and spatial understanding of petroleum systems...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe consumers' {{interest}} in natural preservatives {{seemed to have}} increased because of the apathy and negative effect of synthetic preservatives. This study explored the use of Thaumatococcus daniellii leaves as potential preservatives against fungi responsible for the spoilage of orange juice and corn jell-o. The leaves of the plant were extracted with different solvents – acetone, aqueous, ethanol and hexane – and assayed against test fungi using disc diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory and fungicidal concentrations were determined. The qualitative and quantitative phytochemical analyses of leaves of the plants were carried out, the most active extract of the fresh and dried leaves was assayed via GC–MS for the essential <b>oils</b> and HPLC <b>fingerprinting</b> {{was used to determine}} the phytochemical constituents of the most active extracts. The toxicity test of the extracts against Brine shrimp was carried out after 24 hours of exposure. The ethanol extracts of the plants were the most active based on the antifungal assay. The toxicity test revealed that the extracts of the plants were non-toxic on the Brine shrimps at LD 50 (592. 95 [*]µg/ml and 281. 12 [*]µg/ml for aqueous and ethanol extracts). The qualitative phytochemical screening revealed the presence of alkaloid, tannin, saponins, flavonoids, steroids and terpenoids in the leaf of the plant. The quantitative phytochemical analysis of the most active extract in the plants revealed alkaloids with the highest content of 107. 48 [*]mg/ 100 [*]g. The GC–MS analyses of the fresh leaves of the plants revealed the presence of isodecane at 15. 16 %. The GC–MS analyses of the dried leaves revealed 1, 2, 3 -trimethylbenzene in T. danielli with the highest percentage of 15. 48 %. The HPLC analysis revealed the presence of various phytochemical constituents in the dried leaves of the plant. This study has been able to ascertain the potency of T. daniellii leaves on fungi responsible for spoilage of sweet Citrus sinensis (orange) juice and Corn Jell-O (‘Eko’) which contribute to continuous drive towards the use and total acceptance of natural antimicrobials...|$|R
