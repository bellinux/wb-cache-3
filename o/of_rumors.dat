In September 1754, the governor, Jacinto de Barrios y Jáuregui sent soldiers to investigate, and they captured five Frenchmen who had been living at an Indian village. To dissuade the French from returning, Spain built the presidio of San Agustín de Ahumada and the mission of Nuestra Señora de la Luz de Orcoquisac near the mouth of the Trinity at Galveston Bay. Conditions were awful at the new location, and both the presidio and the mission were closed in 1770.|$|E
5|$|President Arthur {{departed}} Haifa on April 4 for a ten-day excursion in the Mediterranean, calling at Jaffa, Beirut, Alexandria, and Naples, among others, before sailing for the United States from Haifa on April 17.

Five of the Blackshirts had broken noses and black eyes; five American seamen were arrested and a further 15 Americans swam out to their steamer to avoid arrest. After calling at Halifax, the liner docked at Pier 86 in New York on March 8, carrying among its cargo 75,000bags of onions from Alexandria, 16,000cases of lemons from Palermo, and two cases of Jaffa oranges for Nathan Straus. Only 500well-wishers greeted the ship, arriving as it did on the Jewish sabbath, but President Arthur was greeted by the largest police detail in many years because <b>of</b> <b>rumors</b> of a mutiny on board the ship.

40|$|Social media {{platforms}} {{are one of}} {{the fastest}} ways to disseminate information but they have also been used as a means to spread rumors. If left unchecked, rumors have serious consequences. Counter-rumors, messages used to refute rumors, are an important means <b>of</b> <b>rumor</b> curtailment. The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine the types <b>of</b> <b>rumor</b> and counter-rumor messages generated in Twitter in response to the falsely reported death of a politician, Lee Kuan Yew, who was Singapore’s first Prime Minister. Our content analysis of 4321 Twitter tweets about Lee’s death revealed six categories <b>of</b> <b>rumor</b> messages, four categories ofcounter-rumor messages and two categories belonging to neither type. Interestingly, there were more counter-rumor messages than rumor messages. Our results thus suggest that, at least in the context of our study, online users do make an attempt to stop the spread <b>of</b> false <b>rumors</b> through counter-rumors...|$|R

30|$|Undeniably, the {{influences}} of hesitating mechanisms also {{play an important role}} in the process <b>of</b> <b>rumor</b> spreading. Recently, in order to investigate the influence of heterogeneity of the underlying complex networks and hesitating mechanisms on rumor spreading, Liu et al. proposed a SEIR rumor propagation model on the heterogeneous networks [34]. They found that the spreading threshold significantly depends on the topology of the complex networks and analyzed globally dynamic behaviors <b>of</b> the <b>rumor.</b> Wan et al. presented a SEIR rumor spreading model with demographics on scale-free networks [35]. They proved the global asymptotic stability of rumor-free equilibrium and the permanence <b>of</b> the <b>rumor,</b> but the simulation of the experiment was not given, and the direct immunization <b>of</b> <b>rumor</b> spreading was not considered. However, in real life, some wise people or functional departments which realize the information is rumor will take appropriate measures to prevent its continued spreading in the early days when rumors begin to spread, i.e., direct immunization [36]. Furthermore, the initiative response of individual is not considered when rumors spreading prevail, i.e., feedback mechanism. In fact, once people know the harm <b>of</b> <b>rumor,</b> they will question and further verify the rumor, and thus reduce the trust and the spread <b>of</b> <b>rumor.</b> Obviously, the feedback mechanism can change the network topology structure [37, 38]. In this paper, considering the direct immunization, we focus on a SEIR rumor model in social networks, we comprehensively prove the permanence <b>of</b> the <b>rumor</b> spreading in detail. Meanwhile, the modified model with feedback mechanism in social networks is introduced.|$|R

40|$|Rumor {{discourse}} {{has been}} conceptualized {{as an attempt}} to reduce anxiety and uncertainty via a process of social sensemaking.

We propose a categorization <b>of</b> statements (the <b>Rumor</b> Interaction Analysis System) and find differences between dread rumors and wish rumors in anxiety-related content categories. Cluster analysis of these statements reveals a typology of voices (communicative postures) exhibiting sensemaking activities <b>of</b> the <b>rumor</b> discussion group, such as hypothesizing, skeptical critique, directing of activities to gain information, and presentation of evidence.

30|$|This {{paper is}} mainly {{focused on the}} {{dynamics}} <b>of</b> <b>rumor</b> spreading on the complex social networks. A detailed SEIR rumor spreading model with hesitating mechanism has been presented and simulated. By using mean-field theory, we obtained the basic reproduction number R_ 0 and the equilibrium. As the results indicate, the basic reproduction number in society networks is virtually correlated with the fluctuations of the degree distribution. Interestingly, R_ 0 bears {{no relation to the}} degree-dependent immigration b(k). The global stability of equilibrium and the permanence have been proved in detail. We get the conclusion that higher attractiveness and fuzziness <b>of</b> <b>rumor</b> contribute to rumor spreading. Furthermore, increasing feedback parameters can result in the weakness <b>of</b> <b>rumor</b> spreading and the decrease of the population finally is infected. The study may give us valuable guidance to prevent the rumor spreading.|$|R
40|$|A {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} disasters is {{the disruption of}} routine activities in a society. This disruption spurs novel activity {{from a variety of}} social units, from organizations to public officials to ordinary citizens. A major component of this response is informal communication among the public and this public communication increasingly occurs in online settings. Much of this online, informal communication falls under the formal definitions <b>of</b> <b>rumoring</b> and I harness the precision of Twitter's timestamped, geolocated messages to probe the spatial and temporal features <b>of</b> <b>rumoring.</b> A challenge <b>of</b> relying on streams of online data is finding signal amid the overwhelming volume of activity. To overcome this obstacle I use what is known about the spatial and temporal characteristics <b>of</b> both <b>rumoring</b> and disaster-related information transmission to develop a spatio-temporal filtering approach for measuring rumoring. I demonstrate in the first chapter that this approach offers strong increases in signal <b>of</b> hazard-related <b>rumoring</b> activity across a variety of events, both natural and anthropogenic. The results shed light onto the distribution <b>of</b> <b>rumoring</b> activity across large spatial scales. In the second chapter I use the same spatio-temporal filtering approach to identify surges in signal of content <b>of</b> hazard-related <b>rumoring</b> as I look for evidence of topical convergence and content evolution throughout the rumoring process. In the third chapter I test a variety <b>of</b> <b>rumor</b> theories by measuring which features of each U. S. county [...] -its demographics, history of tornado events, and volume interpersonal ties to the tornado-affected county [...] -determine its propensity to rumor about severe tornado events. Using data whose spatio-temporal precision and scope (both in geography and variety of events) have historically been infeasible, this dissertation makes several valuable contributions to rumor theories...|$|R
