The analysis of the data used in this research is a method of multiple linear regression with the dependent variable is profit and the independent variables are dormant account and third party funds. The result shows that the dormant account didn 2 ̆ 7 t have an effect on bank 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>profit.</b> Otherwise, the third party funds/deposit funds has an effect of bank 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>profit.</b> This result imply that bank should reduce the dormant account, if there is a decreasing in dormant account there will be an increasing too in third party funds, and if the third party funds is increasing the bank 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>profit</b> will be also increasingDOI: 10. 15408 /etk. v 14 i 1. 226...|$|R

We find evidence supporting {{the view that}} transfer pricing is used to (i) increase a listed firm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>profits</b> as the corporate income tax rate decreases, (ii) increase a listed firm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>profits</b> if its management 2 ̆ 7 s compensation is determined by reference to reported profits, and (iii) decrease a listed firm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>profits</b> {{as the percentage of}} shares owned by the government increases (i. e., the tunneling effect.)
