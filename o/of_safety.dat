Summing up, {{it should be noted that}} a distinctive feature of the organizational and economic mechanism of management <b>of</b> economic <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> FEA of machine-building enterprise is its basic element of object of influence, namely foreign economic activity and management process happens on the basis of previously carried-out assessment of level <b>of</b> economic <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> FEA on the basis of which are accepted administrative the decision on a choice of activities. The offered stages of management <b>of</b> economic <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> FEA of machine-building enterprises allow to operate more rationally processes of the analysis and a choice of the most expedient activity of the enterprise, and also to define possibility of transition of the enterprise to activity in the direction of FEA which purpose leadership in the market and maximize profits. Results of this research can be used in further scientific developments which will be connected with an assessment of level <b>of</b> economic <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> FEA of machine-building enterprise, formation of strategy and measures <b>of</b> ensuring economic <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> foreign trade activities...|$|R
