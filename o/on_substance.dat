5|$|After two years, Glidden {{abandoned}} {{production of}} cortisone to concentrate <b>on</b> <b>Substance</b> S. Julian developed a multistep process for conversion of pregnenolone, available in abundance from soybean oil sterols, to cortexolone. In 1952, Glidden, {{which had been}} producing progesterone and other steroids from soybean oil, shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an arrangement with Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by Russell Marker after leaving Syntex). Glidden's cost of production of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use progesterone, available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce cortisone and hydrocortisone.|$|E

25|$|The recent {{formulations}} of oxycodone, particularly Purdue Pharma's crush-, chew-, injection- and dissolve-resistant OxyNEO which replaced the banned OxyContin product in Canada in early 2012, {{have led to}} a decline in the abuse of this opiate but have increased the abuse of the more potent drug fentanyl. According to a Canadian Centre <b>on</b> <b>Substance</b> Abuse study quoted in Maclean's magazine, there were at least 655 fentanyl-related deaths in Canada in a five-year period.|$|E

But every showgirl needs a show. The Onyx Hotel tour hardly counts as one, with its arbitrary mishmash of Madonna-esque sex-bomb skits and Cirque du Soleil surrealism". The Seattle Timess Pamela Sitt said it [...] "was high on spectacle and low <b>on</b> <b>substance,</b> veering crazily from burlesque to fairy tale to peep show". Doug Elfman of the Las Vegas Review-Journal stated that the tour [...] "is an unfocused bore of false sexuality, horrible songs, trite choreography, unfocused themes and less ambition than a house cat that sits around licking itself all day". Darryl Morden of msnbc.com commented, [...] "at times it was entertaining but overall came off as {{a variation on the}} same show she's been doing for several years".|$|E

The magazine stated that the [...] "mesmerizing" [...] and [...] "stunning" [...] graphics and sound were [...] "not {{the star of the}} show ... the substance of the game is every bit as good as its packaging", and concluded that Myst [...] "is bound to set a new standard". Myst was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds 1993 [...] "Adventure Game of the Year" [...] award, which ultimately went to [...] and Day of the Tentacle (tie). In 1996, the magazine ranked it 11th on its list of the most innovative computer games.|$|E

[...] Time Out noted: [...] "The weight-watchers script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew that's enjoyably spicy but low <b>on</b> <b>substance.</b> So much story is squeezed into 131 minutes that little time's left for analysis or characterization." [...] Producer Dino De Laurentiis was asked why some characters, notably Jack Crawford, were left out of the film: [...] "I think if you get a book which is 600 pages, you have to reduce it to a script of 100 pages. In two hours of film, you cannot possibly include all the characters. We set ourselves a limit, and cut characters which weren't so vital." ...|$|E

2500|$|While it is {{important}} to note the effect of impulsivity <b>on</b> <b>substance</b> abuse, the reciprocating effect whereby substance abuse can increase impulsivity has also been researched and documented. [...] The promoting effect of impulsivity <b>on</b> <b>substance</b> abuse and the effect of substance abuse on increased impulsivity creates a positive feedback loop that maintains substance seeking behaviors. [...] It also makes conclusions about the direction of causality difficult. [...] This phenomenon has been shown to be related to several substances, but not all. [...] For example, alcohol has been shown to increase impulsivity while amphetamines have had mixed results.|$|E

2500|$|William B. Quandt, in the {{introduction}} of his book Peace Process, says: Sometime in the mid-1970s the term peace process became widely {{used to describe the}} American-led efforts to bring about a negotiated peace between Israel and its neighbors. The phrase stuck, and ever since it has been synonymous with the gradual, step-by-step approach to resolving one of the world's most difficult conflicts. In the years since 1967 the emphasis in Washington has shifted from the spelling out of the ingredients of [...] "peace" [...] to the [...] "process" [...] of getting there. … Much of US constitutional theory focuses on how issues should be resolved – the process – rather than <b>on</b> <b>substance</b> – what should be done. … The United States has provided both a sense of direction and a mechanism. That, at its best, is what the peace process has been about. At worst, it has been little more than a slogan used to mask the marking of time.|$|E

2500|$|John Ricciardi, {{writing for}} Electronic Gaming Monthly, called Nintendo's {{decision}} {{to stick with}} a cartridge format for the Nintendo 64 stubborn. The author called it {{a major contributor to}} the company's competitive disadvantages, even more so than the failed partnership with Sony to create a CD format and console. [...] EDN Magazine said that the Nintendo 64 Game Paks are [...] "bulky and expensive, eating into Nintendo’s profit margins compared with competitors’ inexpensive CD and DVD plastic discs". The Los Angeles Times praised Nintendo's choice of the cartridge medium with its [...] "nonexistent" [...] load times and [...] "continuous, fast-paced action CD-ROMs simply cannot deliver", concluding that [...] "the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 delivers blistering speed and tack-sharp graphics that are unheard of on personal computers and make competing 32-bit, disc-based consoles from Sega and Sony seem downright sluggish". Describing the quality control incentives associated with cartridge-based development, the Times cited Nintendo's position that cartridge game developers tend to [...] "place a premium <b>on</b> <b>substance</b> over flash", and noted that the launch titles lack the [...] "poorly acted live-action sequences or half-baked musical overtures" [...] which it says tend to be found on CD-ROM games.|$|E

Showing concern for a major console product launch during a sharp, several-year long, decline in the game console market, the review said that the long-delayed Nintendo 64 was [...] "worth the wait" [...] in the company's pursuit of quality. [...] Nintendo's [...] "penchant for perfection" [...] in game quality control was praised, though with concerns about having only two launch titles at retail and twelve expected by Christmas.

2500|$|On February 24, 2009, Jindal {{delivered}} the official Republican response to President Obama's address {{to a joint}} session of Congress. Jindal called the president's economic stimulus plan [...] "irresponsible" [...] and argued against government intervention. He used Hurricane Katrina to warn against government solutions to the economic crisis. [...] "Today in Washington, some are promising that government will rescue us from the economic storms raging all around us," [...] Jindal said. [...] "Those of us who lived through Hurricane Katrina, we have our doubts." [...] He praised the late sheriff Harry Lee for standing up to the government during Katrina. The speech met with biting reviews from some members of both the Democratic and the Republican parties. Referring to Jindal as [...] "devoid of substantive ideas for governing the country", political commentator Rachel Maddow summarized Jindal's Katrina remark as follows: [...] " [...] since government failed during Hurricane Katrina, we should understand, not that government {{should not be allowed to}} fail again, but that government...never works. That government can't work, and therefore we should stop seeking a functioning government." [...] David Johnson, a Republican political strategist criticized Jindal's mention of Hurricane Katrina, stating [...] "The one thing Republicans want to forget is Katrina." [...] While Jindal's speech was poorly received by several Democratic and Republican critics, others argued that the speech should be judged <b>on</b> <b>substance</b> rather than delivery style.|$|E

A morning came when I went on deck to survey spaces of a blue and white sea swept by the white March sunlight; to discern at length against the horizon toward which we sped a cloud of the filmiest and most {{delicate}} texture and design. Suddenly I divined that the cloud was France! Little by little, as I watched, it took <b>on</b> <b>substance.</b> I made out headlands and cliffs, and then we were coasting beside them. That night I should be in Paris with Maude. My bag was packed, my steamer trunk closed. I strayed about the decks, in and out of the saloons, wondering at the indifference of other passengers who sat reading in steamer-chairs or wrote last letters to be posted at Havre. I was filled with impatience, anticipation, yes, with anxiety concerning the adventure that was now so imminent; with wavering doubts. Had I done the wisest thing after all? I had the familiar experience that often comes just before reunion after absence of recalling intimate and forgotten impressions of those whom I was about to see again the tones of their voices, little gestures....|$|E
