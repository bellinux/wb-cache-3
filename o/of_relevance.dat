Much {{of the military}} training that was conducted concerned close order drill and equitation. Of the top 25 graduates {{of the class of}} 1915, 24 were commissioned into the Corps of Engineers. The exception, James A. Lester, who was ranked 23rd in the class, chose to go into the field artillery instead. He would also become major general.|$|E

5|$|Lucasfilm {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} a television adaptation of Maniac Mansion, the rights to which were purchased by The Family Channel in 1990. The two companies collaborated with Atlantis Films to produce a sitcom named after the game, which debuted in September of that year. It aired on YTV in Canada and The Family Channel in the United States. Based in part on the video game, the series focuses on the Edison family's life and stars Joe Flaherty as Dr. Fred. Its writing staff was led by Eugene Levy. Gilbert later said that the premise of the series changed during production until it differed heavily from the game's original plot. Upon its debut, the adaptation received positive reviews from Variety, Entertainment Weekly and the Los Angeles Times. Time named it one of the year's best new series. However, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly questioned the decision to air the series on The Family Channel, given Flaherty's subversive humor. Discussing the series in retrospect, Richard Cobbett of PC Gamer criticized its generic storylines and lack <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> to the game. The series lasted for three seasons; sixty-six episodes were filmed.|$|E

5|$|The {{plaintiff}} in Lines International {{argued that the}} guidelines adopted by the multi-agency committee {{set up by the}} PSA, STPB and GSB were invalid as the committee had no existence at law. The High Court held that there was nothing unlawful or even intrinsically wrong with these government agencies setting up such a committee to discuss matters <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> to their respective jurisdictions as long as each agency made its own decisions within the ambit of its own statutory powers. The notion that such a committee fettered PSA's discretion was dismissed by a further finding of fact that the ad-hoc committee had not acted as an entity in itself. Enforcement and appropriate action were left to the agencies. A meeting attended by the plaintiff's representatives at which the guidelines relating to cruises-to-nowhere were announced was facilitated by a moderator rather than a chairperson, and each of the agencies read out guidelines which they themselves would be adopting and implementing.|$|E

40|$|I want {{to thank}} Arthur Sullivan for his {{response}} (this issue) to my article, “Are Mental Properties Causally Relevant? ” (Raymont 2001). In that article, I argued {{that much of the}} recent debate about epiphenomenalism invokes a confused notion <b>of</b> causal <b>relevance.</b> While Sullivan also finds fault with this debate, he does so for different reasons, and is not convinced by my critique to abandon the notion <b>of</b> causal <b>relevance.</b> My response is {{complicated by the fact that}} I now believe that there is a notion <b>of</b> causal <b>relevance</b> that is not threatened by the argument that I offered in the final section of my (2001). I there argued that a prevalent notion <b>of</b> causal <b>relevance</b> is confused because it encapsulates mutually incompatible causal and explanatory requirements. Sullivan finds this critique convincing (Sullivan 2004, p. 5), but believes that the notion <b>of</b> causal <b>relevance</b> can be recuperated by purging it of any explanatory requirement. 1 I have recently moved in a different direction (Raymont 2003), aiming to salvage a notion <b>of</b> causal <b>relevance</b> by weakening the explanatory requirement to which it is subject (and arguing that on this weaker reading there is no reason to doubt the causal <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> mental properties).

If perceived <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> a text can be predicted from eye movements, eye movement signal must contain information on the relevance.
