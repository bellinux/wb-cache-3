5|$|Though {{initially}} {{perceived to}} be a potential threat to The Bahamas and Florida due to its westward motion, the hurricane curved northward on September13, mitigating any evacuation procedures. Despite the storm's change in track, the United States Weather Bureau cautioned shipping interests in the outlying islands of the Bahamas. Pan American World Airways was forced to postpone two transatlantic flights from New York City to Portugal due to the storm. After the hurricane recurved, the Weather Bureau advised caution to areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> coast, particularly in Nantucket and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where strong winds and waves were anticipated. Storm warnings were posted for coastal areas from Hatteras, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine on September16. The warnings were discontinued after the hurricane passed the warned areas.|$|E
5|$|When it {{appeared}} that the war would resume, four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> colonies (Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, New Haven, and Plymouth) formed a defensive compact known as the United Colonies of New England.

His experience in the United Provinces of the Netherlands during the Leiden years was key to organizing the confederation. John Adams later considered the United Colonies to be the prototype for the Articles of Confederation, which was the first attempt at a national government.|$|E
