The {{organizing}} committee had set up 15,000 tickets for the men's discipline on 19 February, but between 25,000 and 30,000 people attended the race, the surplus who did not pay for tickets. The large popularity was to see Norway's favoured Stein Eriksen.

The women's race held the following day was won by the American Andrea Mead-Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|Kemp was {{considered}} {{the star of the}} 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp {{was considered}} the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections, Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement {{by the end of the}} year. In January 1995, Kemp's stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limits, he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling a balanced budget amendment and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 Contract with America. Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell, Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.|$|E
5|$|During a siege on {{the kingdom}} of Doma, Kefka grows {{impatient}} with fellow Imperial General Leo and poisons the drinking water in the castle of Doma, resulting in mass casualties and a swift victory for the Empire. After the alliance of Espers and revolutionaries invade and destroy Vector, Gestahl feigns sorrow for the Empire's evils, and to gain {{the trust of the}} protagonists, Gestahl has Kefka imprisoned, citing the poisoning of Doma. Kefka later goes to the village of Thamasa to kill the espers congregated there, killing Leo when he tries to intervene. Using the power of the espers, Kefka helps Gestahl raise the espers' homeworld and create the Floating Continent, where they intend to awaken three entities known as the Warring Triad. Upon being confronted by the protagonists, Gestahl freezes them except for former Imperial general Celes, whom he orders to kill her friends to show her loyalty to the Empire. She instead stabs Kefka, who becomes enraged. Kefka and the Emperor then get in an argument as to what degree they will wield the power of the triad—the Emperor taking a more conservative approach, since he only wants enough power to rule the world, while Kefka wants to unleash the Warring Triad's full potential. The Emperor tries and fails to kill Kefka, who retaliates by having the Warring Triad strike Gestahl down and unceremoniously boots him off the Floating Continent to his death. Kefka then moves the statues of the Warring Triad <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>balance,</b> unleashing enough raw magical energy to reshape the face of the planet and bringing about the second act of the game.|$|E
5000|$|Professional {{identity}} formation {{is a complex}} process through which the sense of oneness with a profession is developed, {{with some of the}} difficulty arising <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> personal identity with professional identity. Professional identity begins to form while individuals gain their educational training for their profession. Drawing on community of practice theory, transitions between communities can lead to the individual experiencing tension or conflict in how the distinct communities' values and expectations differ, causing the individual to restructure the boundaries between their professional, personal, and private spheres of identity.|$|R

25|$|Yet law was {{not simply}} a matter of codes and procedures. Law was {{understood}} to reflect the moral universe, and a criminal or civil offense would throw that universe <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> in a way that only just punishment could restore. The official Five Punishments (wu xing) prescribed under the Qing Code included beating with the light bamboo, beating with the heavy bamboo, penal servitude, exile, and execution. In calibrating punishment, the magistrate had to take into account not only the nature of the offense but the relation between the guilty party and the victim. An offense by a son against a father was far more serious than one by a father against a son, likewise an offense by a wife or other member of the family.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{theory is}} that the neural {{functions}} that regulate sleep are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> {{in such a way that}} causes different sleep states to overlap. In this case, cholinergic sleep on neural populations are hyper activated and the serotonergic sleep off neural populations are under-activated. As a result, the cells capable of sending the signals that would allow for complete arousal from the sleep state, the serotonergic neural populations, have difficulty in overcoming the signals sent by the cells that keep the brain in the sleep state. During normal REM sleep, the threshold for a stimulus to cause arousal is greatly elevated. Under normal conditions, medial and vestibular nuclei, cortical, thalamic, and cerebellar centers coordinate things such as head and eye movement, and orientation in space.|$|E

25|$|The Roussanne vine ripens {{late and}} is {{characterized}} by its irregular yields that can decrease further due to poor wind resistance. The vine is also susceptible to powdery mildew and rot {{which makes it a}} difficult vine to cultivate. In recent years, the development of better clones has alleviated some of these difficulties. The grape prefers a long growing season but should be harvested before the potential alcohol reaches 14% which would result in the finished wine being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>balance.</b> If picked too soon, the grape can suffer from high acidity. During winemaking, Roussanne is prone to oxidation without care being taken by the winemaker. The wine can benefit from a controlled use of oak. In blends, Roussanne adds aromatics, elegance and acidity with the potential to age and further develop in the bottle.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of wine faults are detected by the nose and the distinctive aromas that they give off. However, the presence of some wine faults can be detected by visual and taste perceptions. For example, premature oxidation can be noticed by the yellowing and browning of the wine's color. The sign of gas bubbles in wines that {{are not meant to}} be sparkling can be a sign of refermentation or malolactic fermentation happening in the bottle. Unusual breaks in the color of the wine could be a sign of excessive copper, iron or proteins that were not removed during fining or filtering. A wine with an unusual color for its variety or wine region could be a sign of excessive or insufficient maceration or as well as poor temperature controls during fermentation. Tactile clues of potential wine faults include the burning, acidic taste associated with volatile acidity that can make a wine seem <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>balance.</b>|$|E

500|$|If all the {{obstacles}} of the Duat could be negotiated, the deceased would be judged in the [...] "Weighing of the Heart" [...] ritual, depicted in Spell 125. The deceased {{was led by}} the god Anubis into the presence of Osiris. There, the dead person swore {{that he had not}} committed any sin from a list of 42 sins, reciting a text known as the [...] "Negative Confession". Then the dead person's heart was weighed on a pair of scales, against the goddess Maat, who embodied truth and justice. Maat was often represented by an ostrich feather, the hieroglyphic sign for her name. At this point, there was a risk that the deceased's heart would bear witness, owning up to sins committed in life; Spell 30B guarded against this eventuality. If the scales balanced, this meant the deceased had led a good life. Anubis would take them to Osiris and they would find their place in the afterlife, becoming maa-kheru, meaning [...] "vindicated" [...] or [...] "true of voice". If the heart was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> with Maat, then another fearsome beast called Ammit, the Devourer, stood ready to eat it and put the dead person's afterlife to an early and unpleasant end.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Balancing is {{a common}} {{preprocessing}} step for the unsymmetric eigenvalue problem. If a matrix is badly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> scale, <b>balancing</b> can markedly improve {{the accuracy of the}} computed eigenvalues. This paper discusses a situation where balancing has the opposite effect. If a matrix that is not <b>out</b> <b>of</b> scale has been transformed to upper Hessenberg form, a subsequent <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> the Hessenberg matrix will cause the condition numbers of the eigenvalues to be degraded. Consequently the computed eigenvalues will be substantially less accurate than they would have been if the Hessenberg matrix had not been balanced...|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to characterizing individual people who exhibit destructive tendencies, the wendigo can also describe movements and events with similarly negative effects. According to professor Chris Schedler, {{the figure of}} the wendigo represents “consuming forms of exclusion and assimilation” through which groups dominate other groups." [...] This application allows Native Americans to describe colonialism and its agents as wendigos, since the process of colonialism ejected natives from their land and threw the natural world <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>balance.</b> DeSanti points to the 1999 horror film Ravenous as an illustration of this argument equating “the cannibal monster” to “American colonialism and manifest destiny”. This movie features a character who articulates that expansion brings displacement and destruction as side effects, explaining that “manifest destiny” and “western expansion” will bring “thousands of gold-hungry Americans [...] [...] [...] over the mountains in search of new lives [...] [...] [...] This country is seeking to be whole [...] [...] [...] Stretching out its arms [...] [...] [...] and consuming all it can. And we merely follow”. For a more detailed exploration linking wendigo attributes to colonialism, see Jack D.

2500|$|Most emphatically in The Sickness Unto Death, Kierkegaard's author {{argues that}} the human self is a {{composition}} of various aspects that must be brought into conscious balance: the finite, the infinite, a consciousness of the [...] "relationship of the two to itself," [...] and a consciousness of [...] "the power that posited" [...] the self.

2500|$|The first {{successful}} commercial production of California Chardonnay was from plantings in the Livermore Valley AVA. Wente Vineyards developed a Chardonnay clone {{that was used}} to introduce the grape variety in several Californian vineyards throughout the 1940s. In the 1950s, James David Zellerbach, one-time US Ambassador to Rome, started Hanzell Vineyards winery and dedicated it to making Burgundian-style Chardonnay. His success encouraged other Californian winemakers to follow suit and culminated in Chateau Montelena's victory over Burgundy Chardonnay in the 1976 blind tasting event conducted by French judges known as the Judgment of Paris. In response, the demand for Californian Chardonnay increased and Californian winemakers rushed to increase plantings. In the 1980s, the popularity of Californian Chardonnay increased so much, the number of vines planted in the state eclipsed that of France by 1988. By 2005, nearly [...] accounted for almost 25% of the world's total Chardonnay plantings. The early trend was to imitate the great Burgundy wines, but this soon gave way to more rich buttery and oaked styles. Starting with the 1970s, the focus was on harvesting the grapes at more advanced degrees of ripeness and higher Brix levels. New oak barrels were used to produce wines that were big in body and mouthfeel. Frank J. Prial of The New York Times was an early critic of this style, particularly {{because of the lack of}} [...] "food friendliness" [...] that was common with these massive wines. Another criticism of California Chardonnays, and one that has been levied against other Californian wines, is the very high alcohol levels which can make a wine seem <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>balance.</b> In recent years, California winemakers have been using process such as reverse osmosis and spinning cones to bring the alcohol levels down to 12 to 14%.|$|E

In an October 1972 issue, fellow critic Roger Greenspun panned it for not [...] "even reasonably try" [...] to make the rabbits scary, its reliance on [...] "tired clichés of monsterdom", [...] "technical laziness" [...] in its special effects, [...] "stupid story", and [...] "dumb direction that leaves the film in limbo" [...] between a horror film and a fairy tale. In the Monthly Film Bulletin, Tom Milne felt Night of the Lepus had a promising beginning before moving into a [...] "well-worn horror groove", such as the effort to trap Gerry and Amanda alone in a deserted area for a last-minute rescue. Noting that the film had [...] "a certain overall charm and several striking sequences", he felt the film would have been more successful if it [...] "had the courage of its convictions – and its realism". As an example, he points to the scene following the attack on the Calhoun ranch, in which Roy is walking into town, and tourists refuse to stop and pick him up because he has a gun. The tourists then go to the small town where the rabbits have killed everyone and are hiding in the buildings. Rather than becoming the next victims, the family call it a ghost town and leave. In the 1977 piece Dark Dreams 2.0: A Psychological History of the Modern Horror Film, Charles Derry compared it to the earlier successful works The Birds and Willard, particularly the former, noting that both featured a [...] "loveable creature".
