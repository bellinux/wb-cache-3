40|$|Abstract. The error-ranges of exact {{rational}} {{numbers and}} intervals can be guaranteed {{even during the}} arithmetic operations whereas we cannot rely on the error-ranges of floating-point <b>numbers.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we propose a novel number system, where the exact rational numbers are strictly separated from inexact floating point numbers and carefully in-tegrated with the inexact numbers. A three-valued logic is also shipped with <b>our</b> <b>number</b> system to appropriately deal with uncertainties due to the inexactness. A prototype implementation of <b>our</b> <b>number</b> system <b>in</b> Python is demonstrated. ...|$|R

By the time they have all assembled we can see what had best be done." ...|$|R

50|$|A protest permit or parade permit is {{permission}} {{granted by}} a governmental agency for a demonstration {{to be held}} in a particular venue at a particular time. Failing to obtain a permit may lead to charges of parading without a permit. The requirement of a permit is sometimes denounced as an infringement of free speech, as permits are denied on spurious grounds or protestors are corralled into free speech zones. Permits are sometimes denied on grounds that the protest will create a security risk. There seems to be evidence that the available venues for protests are shrinking in number; that citizens have experienced increasing difficulty in gaining unrestricted access to them; and that such venues are no longer where most people typically congregate <b>in</b> large <b>numbers.</b> <b>In</b> <b>Washington,</b> DC, the National Park Service Police, U.S. Capitol Police, and Metropolitan Police of the District of Columbia have an elaborate permitting system. Many famous people such as Martin Luther King, Jr. have been arrested for protesting without a permit.|$|R

60|$|The king having lodged {{his train}} of {{artillery}} and baggage in Donnington Castle, marched {{the next day}} for Oxford. There we joined him with 3000 horse and 2000 foot. Encouraged with this reinforcement, the king appears upon the hills on the north-west of Newbury, and faces the Parliament army. The Parliament having too many generals as well as soldiers, they could not agree whether they should fight or no. This was no great token of the victory they boasted of, for they were now twice <b>our</b> <b>number</b> <b>in</b> the whole, and their foot three for one. The king stood in battalia all day, and finding the Parliament forces had no stomach to engage him, he drew away his cannon and baggage out of Donnington Castle in view of their whole army, and marched away to Oxford.|$|R

From the outside, they observed the station's antenna inside a military facility, the Warrenton Training Center. The station hunter speculated that the antenna's transmitter at the facility was connected by a telephone wire pair to a source of spoken <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> the <b>Washington,</b> D.C. area. The author said the Federal Communications Commission {{would not comment on}} public inquiries about numbers stations on American territory.|$|R

Being of large frame {{and it may be}} of swifter foot than common, the young Captain saw fit to command Reuben Ring to flank one end of the line, and a man, who is nothing short of him in either speed, or strength, to do the same duty on the other. There was nothing particularly worthy of mention that took place on the flank I held, for the first two hours; unless indeed the fact, that three several times did I fall upon a maze of well-beaten deer-tracks, that as often led to nothing----" ...|$|R

Our passengers hailed from fifteen states; only a few of them had ever been to sea before; manifestly it would not do to pit them against a full-blown tempest until they had got their sea-legs on. Toward evening the two steam tugs that had accompanied us with a rollicking champagne-party of young New Yorkers on board who wished to bid farewell to one of <b>our</b> <b>number</b> <b>in</b> due and ancient form departed, and we were alone on the deep. On deep five fathoms, and anchored fast to the bottom. And out in the solemn rain, at that. This was pleasuring with a vengeance.|$|R

50|$|The {{persistent}} unpopularity of {{new area}} code creation, whether by split or overlay plans, {{led to a}} change in the rules of <b>number</b> block allocation, <b>in</b> order to conserve the pool of available telephone numbers. This change, which allowed for the assignment of smaller number blocks, is commonly known as number pooling. This has noticeably slowed the need for area code growth. For example, the western half of Washington, including Seattle, narrowly avoided the need for an overlay in 2001. Area code 564, originally planned for introduction in October 2001, was canceled in August 2001 after state regulators determined that the use of number pooling had allowed existing <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> western <b>Washington</b> to be used more efficiently.|$|R

It was thought best, however, to add two Indians to <b>our</b> <b>number,</b> <b>in</b> the double character of hunters and runners, or messengers. One of these red-skins was called Jumper, {{in the language of}} the settlement where we found them; and the other Trackless; the latter sobriquet having been given him on account of a faculty he possessed of leaving little or no trail in his journeys and marches. This Indian was about six-and-twenty years of age, and was called a Mohawk, living with the people of that tribe; though, I subsequently ascertained that he was, in fact, an Onondago [34] by birth. His true name was Susquesus, or Crooked Turns; an appellation that might or might not speak well of his character, as the Turns' were regarded in a moral, or in a physical sense.|$|R

If we can document <b>our</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> some tangible way, we will be in a stronger position to attain more credibility as a religion and as a community. Greater credibility would enable us to better address issues of religious discrimination and social prejudice (the Helms Bill, or movies such as The Craft, for instance); would give us more weight in addressing anti-Pagan stereotypes ... and it would give us greater access to influential forums (such as academia, interfaith councils, etc.) from which Pagans have mostly been excluded."
