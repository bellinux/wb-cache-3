25|$|Dermatological {{vascular}} laser (single wavelength) or intense {{pulsed light}} (broad spectrum) machines <b>offer</b> <b>one</b> of the treatments for rosacea, {{in particular the}} erythema (redness) of the skin. They use light to penetrate the epidermis to target the capillaries in the dermis layer of the skin. The light is absorbed by oxyhemoglobin, which heats up, causing the capillary walls to heat up to 70°C (158°F), damaging them, and causing them to be absorbed by the body's natural defense mechanism. With {{a sufficient number of}} treatments, this method may even eliminate the redness altogether, though additional periodic treatments will likely be necessary to remove newly formed capillaries.|$|E

In order to ensure that migrants have a better chance for jobs, it wants to deal firmly with discrimination, especially on the labour market. The party wants to decrease income differences by making child benefits. The party favours reform of government pensions: after 45 years of employment one should get the right to a pension. If one starts working young, one is able to stop working earlier than if one starts working when one is older. Receiving unemployment or disability benefits is counted as work, as is caring for children or family members. The system of mortgage interest deductions should be abolished over a forty-year period.|$|E

[...] They next approached Arthur, and Conkling advised him to also reject the nomination, believing the Republicans would lose. Arthur thought otherwise and accepted. [...] According to a purported eyewitness account by journalist William C. Hudson, Conkling and Arthur argued, with Arthur telling Conkling, [...] "The office of the Vice-President is a greater honor than I ever dreamed of attaining."

[...] He also made it clear that, were he posted to India, he would want the supreme military command in addition to civil control. When informed that Pitt was agreeable to this demand, he went {{through a period of}} soul-searching, torn between the conflicting demands of family and country. [...] This, however, was not the only troubling issue. [...] When Parliament took up consideration of assignments in India in August 1784, it was only prepared to <b>offer</b> <b>one</b> of the two posts, which he again refused to consider.

500|$|The {{television}} {{show that the}} Simpson family watches {{at the beginning of}} the episode, in which the two reviewers discuss the latest McBain film, is a parody of the American television series Siskel & Ebert & the Movies. In the flashback sequence, Homer is seen singing along to the 1973 song [...] "The Joker" [...] by the Steve Miller Band while driving to school. Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin posters hang on the wall of Homer's 1974 bedroom. The 1970 song [...] "(They Long to Be) Close to You" [...] by The Carpenters is heard when Homer sees Marge for the first time. Homer eats a bucket of Shakespeare Fried Chicken when he reveals his feelings towards Marge to Grampa. At the debate, Homer disagrees about the idea of lowering the United States national speed limit to 55mph (90km/h), arguing that [...] "Sure, it'll save a few lives, but millions will be late!" [...] This is a reference to the National Maximum Speed Law provision of the 1974 Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act that prohibited speed limits higher than 55mph. Barney asks a girl named Estelle if she wants to go to the prom with him, but she tells him that she would not go to the prom with him even if he were American actor Elliott Gould. Artie says he can think of a dozen highly cogent arguments to why Marge should accept his prom <b>offer,</b> <b>one</b> of which is from a Time magazine titled [...] "America's Love Affair with the Prom: Even wallflowers can look forward to one date a year," [...] a reference to the American magazine Time. Songs played in the episode include [...] "The Streak" [...] by Ray Stevens , [...] "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" [...] by Elton John, [...] "Colour My World" [...] by Chicago, [...] "Pick Up the Pieces" [...] by Average White Band, and [...] "The Hustle" [...] by Van McCoy.|$|E
500|$|Both AllHipHop and Billboard {{were very}} {{positive}} toward Gravity after a preview listening session, considering it Lecrae's strongest and most mainstream work to date. AllHipHop stated that [...] "overall, {{it appears that}} Lecrae is ready to <b>offer</b> <b>one</b> of his most broad and, dare-we-say, mainstream albums in terms of sound; yet, it still manages to capture the trueness {{of what he has}} always stood for and rapped about. If anything, Gravity is a giant step forward for his expanding career, and it will surely be a welcome addition to many 'Top 10' lists when 2012 comes to a close." [...] Indie Vision Music in announcing the cover of Gravity called the album [...] "likely the biggest Christian hip hop album yet". AllHipHop listed [...] "Mayday" [...] as one of the standout tracks on the album, noting the [...] "beautiful" [...] melody and hook by Ashthon Jones. The reviewer considered [...] "Violence" [...] a personal favorite, calling Lecrae's line [...] "Grew up under Tupac, bible verse and two glocks" [...] {{one of the most powerful}} lines on the album. Parlé Magazine also was favorable to the song, stating [...] "That track is definitely going places." [...] Jonathan Landrum of The Associated Press was favorable to the album, saying that [...] "in his sixth album 'Gravity,' Lecrae delivers a strong piece of work. He's not afraid to rap about his past mistakes, supplying inspirational rhymes filled with Christian values backed by well-produced secular hip-hop beats." [...] In its track-by-track review of the album, The Boombox stated that [...] "based on the warm reception to Church Clothes, this LP is set to stir the pot further in the realm of both of hip-hop and Christianity." [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars, declaring that Lecrae makes Gravitys various genre experiments and jumps in style [...] "sound effortless and natural". He asserted that [...] "while Rehab is the more rewarding album in the end, this one is more persuasive and immediate, making it an easy entry point into this gifted artist's discography." ...|$|E
