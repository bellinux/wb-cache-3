5000|$|The {{video for}} the song was {{directed}} by Mat Kirkby, who previously directed the duo's [...] "Good Luck" [...] video, which features a lookalike Queen Elizabeth II drinking, fighting and fleeing police during a night out in Soho, London. In an interview with Canadian music magazine The Record, Buxton stated:Because the song is called [...] "U Don't Know Me," [...] Kirkby {{thought it would be}} quite interesting for it to be about the Queen and to have her on a night <b>off,</b> <b>sort</b> of just going out, just leaving her bodyguards behind…so about do we really know the Queen, the people in the media, do we really know them? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It strikes me," [...] said Paget, [...] "the school haven't {{got over}} the {{holidays}} yet. I never saw such a lot of slackers. You ought to have taken thirty points <b>off</b> the <b>sort</b> of team you had against you today." ...|$|R
6000|$|Clive says, [...] "he {{will sit}} and smoke a cheroot with Mr. Binnie, if they please." [...] James's countenance falls. [...] "We have left <b>off</b> that <b>sort</b> of thing here, my dear Clive, a long time," [...] cries Mrs. Mackenzie, departing from the dining-room.|$|R
2500|$|In 1978 {{the team}} also {{published}} a book. These publications sparked <b>off</b> a <b>sort</b> of [...] "transit race" [...] in {{the same sort of}} fashion as the space race, with countries around the world rushing to join {{what appeared to be a}} future market of immense size.|$|R

"I {{feel the}} justice of what you say, my love," [...] {{returned}} the mournful voice of her governess, [...] "and yet am I so weak as to be unable entirely to shake <b>off</b> a <b>sort</b> of superstitious feeling on this subject.

6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} I said to Mrs. Aleshine," [...] said Mrs. Lecks, [...] "and that's {{the reason we}} let our irons cool, and come out here to talk to you. It's just like a young man to keep puttin' <b>off</b> that <b>sort</b> of thing, but this can't be put off." ...|$|R

60|$|Yes, {{that was}} it, {{the doctor was}} a chump. So far from doing him any harm, these nightly potations brightened Nutty up, gave him heart, and enabled him to endure life in this hole of a place. He felt a certain scornful amusement. Doctors, he supposed, had to get <b>off</b> that <b>sort</b> of talk to earn their money.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, as {{my views}} changed my course became very depressing. I found that I {{was trying to}} be like people who had hardly {{anything}} in common with myself. I was endeavouring to put <b>off</b> one <b>sort</b> of life for another sort of life, which was not better than the life I had known before. It was simply different." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I should say! I {{was one of}} the executors. He hadn't {{anything}} to leave but a wheelbarrow, and he left that to me. It hadn't any wheel, and wasn't any good.

5000|$|Del Rey {{would later}} {{respond to this}} in a 2017 interview, stating: [...] "I didn’t edit myself Born to Die when I could have, {{because a lot of}} it’s just the way it was. I mean, because I’ve changed a lot and a lot of those songs, it’s not that I don’t relate but… A lot of it too is I was just kinda nervous. I came <b>off</b> <b>sort</b> of nervously, and there was just a lot of dualities, a lot of juxtapositions going on that maybe just felt like {{something}} was a little off. Maybe the thing that was off was that I needed a little more time or something, and also my path was just so windy just to get to having a first record. I feel like I had to figure it out all by myself. Every move was just guesswork." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{were never}} more mistaken in your life, Mr. Burns," [...] I said quietly, duly smiling at him; and the trap drove <b>off</b> to a <b>sort</b> of sanatorium, a {{pavilion}} of bricks which {{the doctor had}} in the grounds of his residence.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{behaved like}} an idiot, that's all. My nerves were in rags. I was worried. We're the hysterical animal, Mr. Capes. I got myself locked up to cool <b>off.</b> By a <b>sort</b> of instinct. As a dog eats grass. I'm right again now." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Dylan, [...] "On a Night Like This" [...] was not {{a typical}} song for him to write, saying that it [...] "comes <b>off</b> as <b>sort</b> of like a drunk man whos {{temporarily}} sober.". [...] Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin found the song a disappointing start to Planet Waves. [...] However, he did acknowledge some positive features: that [...] "playing swings" [...] and that Dylan is in good voice. [...] He also acknowledges some clever lyrics.

60|$|Fred {{had gone}} <b>off</b> into a <b>sort</b> of doze, so he bore the {{inspection}} well, but Sam was only pretending to sleep, {{and when he}} peeped up at the old face that looked down on his with kindly interest and curiosity, he {{found it difficult to}} check a smile.|$|R
6000|$|I {{drew him}} aside, whispering, [...] "Shaynor seemed going <b>off</b> into some <b>sort</b> of fit when I spoke to you just now. I thought, {{even at the}} risk of being rude, it wouldn't do to take you off your {{instruments}} just as the call was coming through. Don't you see?" ...|$|R

5000|$|The name of {{the band}} derives from [...] "con safos," [...] a Chicano term meaning [...] "with safety," [...] used to mark graffiti.

50|$|At that time, the Yakuza {{were all}} about money and violence. If the Yakuza had any sort of {{problems}} they either paid people <b>off</b> or <b>sorted</b> out their problems with violence. However the way Ishii viewed things was different compared to the typical Yakuza. Ishii never favored violence and whenever he came across a problem he would always think and talk {{his way out of}} problems. Ishii did not use violence or money to solve any of his problems. Ishii also did not receive money from anyone when others wanted to resolve a problem with him or his clan. Ishii changed the overall image of the Japanese Yakuza with his words.|$|R
