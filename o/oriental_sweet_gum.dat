50|$|<b>Oriental</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> is a {{deciduous}} tree, 30-35 m {{in height}} with a trunk of 100 cm in diameter. The unisexual flowers bloom from March to April. The fruits ripen in November to December and the seeds are wind dispersed. The tree is very attractive and especially valued for its colourful autumn leafs. <b>Oriental</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> trees favour {{an elevation of}} between 0-400 m, a mean annual rainfall of 1000-1200 mm and a mean annual temperature of 18 C. The tree's optimal growth is on rich, deep and moist soils such as bogs, river banks and coastal areas {{but it is also}} able to grow on slopes and dry soil.|$|E

25|$|The {{imperfect}} fungus Tubakia dryina Sutton is a leaf parasite {{reported to}} occur {{on a wide}} range of host plants, including species of <b>Sweet</b> <b>Gum</b> (Liquidambar styraciflua L.). Limber and Cash reported that leaf spots produced by this pathogen on several different genera of forest trees were 2–5mm diameter with regular margins. During the summer of 1994 in the Nacogdoches County area of Texas, a prominent leaf spot on <b>Sweet</b> <b>Gum</b> was widespread. Infected leaves had numerous necrotic lesions, each surrounded by a reddish halo. The lesions tended to merge resulting in large areas of dead tissue. Infection and fungal development of D.dryina were investigated on leaves of <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> using a combination of microscopic techniques. D.dryina infection on <b>Sweet</b> <b>Gum</b> has been associated with the disease red leaf spot. Results of this investigation indicate that D.dryina can penetrate leaf tissue directly, thus having the ability to initiate infection on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. In other regions of the U.S., <b>Sweet</b> <b>Gum</b> populations may not be as susceptible to local populations of this fungus. Environmental stress factors may also be involved, as reports have indicated that herbicide application and chlorosis caused by iron deficiency may increase susceptibility of Dicarpella dryina. Tannins (a type of biomolecule found in trees to protect it from fire, insects, and bacteria) have been reported to occur in healthy tissue of a variety of plants including <b>sweet</b> <b>gum.</b> They may prevent pathogen invasion by inhibiting fungal enzyme activity. Although cells of healthy <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> tissue appear rich in tannins, these materials apparently were not effective in preventing fungal colonization by D.dryina.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{tolerance}} of woody plants to picloram (4 amino- 3, 5, 6 -trichloropicolinic acid) {{has been shown}} by field applications to vary from mild to extreme. A laboratory study was done to investigate the basic causes for this range of tolerance known to exist among three woody plant species, Fraxinus pennsylvanics, March, (green ash) resistant, Liquidambar styraoiflua L., (<b>sweet</b> <b>gum)</b> intermediate, and Acer saccharinum L., (silver maple) susceptible. Seedlings of each species were grown in a nutrient solution in a controlled environment room {{for at least three}} weeks prior to treatment with picloram. Comparable response curves of all three species were determined by measuring the change in CO₂ absorption and evolution rates as a function of picloram concentration in the nutrient solution. A second experiment measured the time-dependent change in plant CO₂ absorption and evolution at 0. 1 ppm picloram. Photosynthesis and respiratory rates were measured by monitoring the change in CO₂ concentration in a closed flow system with a CO₂ gas analyzer. For plants in a similar physiological state, it was postulated that picloram-induced changes in CO₂ absorption and evolution are comparable measures of special response. The results of the second experiment show a recovery in the photosynthetic rates of green ash (B) and <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> (I) following 6 - 12 days of steady decline. This seems to indicate a resistance mechanism resulting from a shift in the primary biochemical pathways. Such a mechanism is not evident in silver maple. The respiration rate of <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> is slightly stimulated by 0. 1 ppm picloram while that of silver maple is depressed to 30 per cent of its original value. This is further evidence for a relative biochemical {{tolerance of}} <b>sweet</b> <b>gum.</b> Also, an experiment designed to compare leaf absorption of 10 ppm picloram between <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> and silver maple showed no practical difference to exist. Inspection of the concentration-response curves (CO₂ absorption) indicates silver maple to be slightly less tolerant to picloram at 0. 3 and 1. 0 ppm than either <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> or green ash. However, the characteristic "dip" in the photosynthetic rates of <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> and green ash, as noted in experiment two, corresponds to the period (ten days) of picloram exposure. Therefore, <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> and green ash are shown to be less tolerant than is actually the case. Future work utilizing this means of measuring relative plant response among species should include a determination of this higher concentrations to damp the fluctuations. The picloram uptake pattern of each species was determined by sampling the nutrient solution at times corresponding to photosynthesis and respiration measurements. (Experiment tow) The picloram concentration was determined with gas chromatography. Green ash was shwed a slow accumulation of picloram while both silver maple and <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> showed similar patterns of initial picloram uptake followed by a release back to the nutrient solution. The release by silver maple is thought to be due to general plant deterioration with a resulting flow along the concentration gradient. The release from <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> is thought {{to be the result of}} active exudation processes which may also be a resistance mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{rainfall}} interception {{study was}} conducted in Oakland, California to determine the partitioning of rainfall and the chemical composition of precipitation, throughfall, and stemflow. Rainfall interception measurements were conducted on a gingko (Ginkgo biloba) (13. 5 mtall deciduous tree), <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> (Liquidambar styraciflua) (8. 8 m tall deciduous), and lemon tree (Citrus limon) (2. 9 m tall broadleaf evergreen). The lemon, ginkgo, and <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> intercepted 27. 0 %, 25. 2 % and 14. 3 % of gross precipitation, respectively. The lemon tree was most effective because it retained its foliage year-round, storing more winter rainfall than the leafless ginkgo and <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> trees. Stemflow was more important for the leafless <b>sweet</b> <b>gum.</b> Because of its excurrent growth habit and smooth bark, 4. 1 % of annual rainfall flowed to the ground as stemflow, compared to less than 2. 1 % for the lemon and 1. 0 % for the ginkgo. Water samples were collected from throughfall, stemflow, and a nearby control site to measure concentrations of nutrients and heavy metals. Compared to the control, samples from under trees had higher concentrations of nutrients and metals (e. g., N, P, K, Zn and Cr), indicating that atmospheric deposition to tree crowns was a major source of pollutants. Nutrient and metal concentrations were highest in gingko tree’s throughfall. Its rough stem surfaces and dense branching pattern appeared to trap more pollutions than the other two trees...|$|R
