Later that year, Cao Pi ended the Eastern Han dynasty and {{established}} the state of Cao Wei with him as its first emperor. Sun Quan pledged allegiance to Cao Pi in 221 and sent Yu Jin back to Wei in autumn. By then, Yu Jin was a pallid-looking <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> head full of grey hair. He knelt down, kowtowed and cried when he met Cao Pi. Cao Pi comforted him, told him about Xun Linfu and Mengmingshi, and then commissioned him as General Who Pacifies the Borders (安遠將軍).|$|E
25|$|The Prose Merlin {{contains}} many instances of Merlin's shapeshifting. He {{appears as a}} woodcutter with an axe about his neck, big shoes, a torn coat, bristly hair, and a large beard. He is later found in the forest of Northumberland by a follower of Uther's disguised as an ugly man and tending a great herd of beasts. He then appears first as a handsome man {{and then as a}} beautiful boy. Years later, he approaches Arthur disguised as a peasant wearing leather boots, a wool coat, a hood, and a belt of knotted sheepskin. He is described as tall, black and bristly, and as seeming cruel and fierce. Finally, he appears as an <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> long beard, short and hunchbacked, in an old torn woolen coat, who carries a club and drives a multitude of beasts before him.|$|E

25|$|A young Japanese {{professional}} {{is struck}} blind {{in his car}} at a crossing and is then approached by a few people, one offers to drive him home and steals his car. The blinded man describes his sudden affliction as an expanse of dazzling white. Upon arriving home and noticing her husband's blindness, the man's wife takes him to a local ophthalmologist who, after testing the man's eyes, can identify nothing wrong and recommends further evaluation at a hospital. Among the doctor's patients are an <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> black eye-patch, a woman with dark glasses, and a young boy. During a dinner with his wife, the doctor discusses the strange case. The woman with dark glasses, revealed to be a call-girl, becomes the third victim of the strange blindness after an appointment with a john in a hotel.|$|E
500|$|In addition, Bramshill House {{was cited}} by the {{historian}} William Page as a possible location for the Legend of the Mistletoe Bough, a ghost story associated with several English country mansions. This legend tells of a bride who supposedly hid in a wooden chest during a game of hide and seek on her wedding night. In the case of Bramshill House, the story has it that this happened at Christmas time, and that the bride was found fifty years later still wearing her wedding dress and with a sprig of mistletoe in her hand; the chest is {{on display in the}} entrance hall. The woman is sometimes identified as John Cope's daughter Anne, who married Hugh Bethell of Yorkshire. An alternative claim is that she was Genevre Orsini, who was married in 1727, and that her ghost came to Bramshill from Italy together with the chest. In his monograph on the house, the Victorian writer Sir William Cope preferred this theory and added that the chest on display was not the original, which had been proved large enough by [...] "a woman of comely proportions" [...] who had tested it by lying down in it, but which had been taken away by Sir Denzil Cope's widow in 1812. The ghost of the bride {{is referred to as the}} White Lady, and she is said by Legg to haunt the Fleur de Lys room. According to Legg, Michael I of Romania asked to be moved to another room during a stay there, in order to not be disturbed by the young woman in white who passed through his bedroom every night. An <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grey beard, thought by Legg to be the father or husband of the White Lady, is reported to stare through windows and at the Mistletoe Chest.|$|E

2500|$|Ford's brother Eddie was a {{crew member}} and they fought constantly; on one {{occasion}} Eddie reportedly [...] "went after the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pick handle". There was only a short synopsis written when filming began and Ford wrote and shot the film day by day. Production fell behind schedule, delayed by constant bad weather and the intense cold, and Fox executives repeatedly demanded results, but Ford would either tear up the telegrams or hold them up and have stunt gunman Edward [...] "Pardner" [...] Jones shoot holes through the sender's name. Despite the pressure to halt the production, studio boss William Fox finally backed Ford and allowed him to finish the picture and his gamble paid off handsomely—The Iron Horse {{became one of the}} top-grossing films of the decade, taking over US$2million worldwide, against a budget of $280,000.|$|E

2500|$|Puyi had a {{standard}} Confucian education, being taught the various Confucian classics and nothing else. Puyi later wrote: [...] "I learnt nothing of mathematics, let alone science, {{and for a}} long time I had no idea where Beijing was situated". When Puyi was 13, he met his parents and siblings, all of whom had to kowtow before him as he sat upon the Dragon Throne. By this time, Puyi had forgotten what his mother looked like. Such was the awe that the Emperor was held that his younger brothr Pujie never heard his parents refer Puyi as [...] "your elder brother", who was always just the Emperor. Pujie told Behr his image of Puyi prior to meeting him was that of [...] "...a venerable <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> beard. I couldn't believe it when I saw this boy in yellow robes sitting solemnly on the throne". It was decided that Pujie would join Puyi in the Forbidden City to provide him with a playmate, though Puyi was notably angry when he discovered his brother was wearing yellow [...] the color of the Qing [...] as he believed that only Emperors had the right to wear yellow, and it had to be explained to him that all members of the Qing family could wear yellow.|$|E
2500|$|The {{only two}} {{significant}} big-screen performances of Shakespeare's text {{date from the}} early 1970s: Grigori Kozintsev was working on his Korol Lir {{at the same time}} as Peter Brook was filming his King Lear. Brook's film starkly divided the critics: Pauline Kael said [...] "I didn't just dislike this production, I hated it!" [...] and suggested the alternative title [...] "Night of the Living Dead". Yet Robert Hatch in The Nation thought it as [...] "excellent a filming of the play as one can expect" [...] and Vincent Canby in The New York Times called it [...] "an exalting Lear, full of exquisite terror". The film drew heavily on the ideas of Jan Kott, in particular his observation that King Lear was the precursor of absurdist theatre: in particular, the film has parallels with Beckett's Endgame. Critics who dislike the film particularly draw attention to its bleak nature from its opening: complaining that the world of the play does not deteriorate with Lear's suffering, but commences dark, colourless and wintry, leaving (in Douglas Brode's words) [...] "Lear, the land, and us with nowhere to go". Cruelty pervades the film, which does not distinguish between the violence of ostensibly good and evil characters, presenting both savagely. Paul Scofield, as Lear, eschews sentimentality: this demanding <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> coterie of unruly knights provokes audience sympathy for the daughters in the early scenes, and his presentation explicitly rejects the tradition (as Daniel Rosenthal describes it) of playing Lear as [...] "poor old white-haired patriarch".|$|E
