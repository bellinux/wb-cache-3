5|$|In 2005, {{the body}} of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The body was bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, {{it was found that the}} head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At autopsy, medical examiners found that both the head and shoulders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as few medical practitioners have been able to observe and document the progress of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|Mammals {{include the}} biggest animals on the planet, the great whales. The basic body type is a {{terrestrial}} quadruped, but some mammals are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in trees, underground or on two legs.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{developed}} aiming to evaluate <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> maternal feed-restriction on development of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of bovine fetus at different gestational stages. Feed-restricted cows were fed 1. 2 times the maintenance level while {{the control group}} was fed ad libitum. Pregnant cows were slaughtered at 136, 189, 239, and 269 days of gestation and gastrointestinal tracts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fetuses</b> were evaluated. No effects of maternal nutrition on body weight (P= 0. 17) and body length (P= 0. 13) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fetuses</b> were observed. No major effects of feed restriction on GIT mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fetuses</b> were observed (P= 0. 51). However, <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> small intestine per unit of body weight was 11. 24 % greater (P= 0. 04) in fetuses from restricted dams. Additionally, <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> small intestine and its villi were 12. 93 % and 16. 44 % respectively greater (P<. 001) in fetuses from restricted dams compared to those from non-restricted dams. These data indicates that maternal feed-restriction does not affect <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> most of fetal gastrointestinal parts besides small intestine which in turn increases its surface area as a response of maternal feed restriction...|$|R
40|$|Female rabbits became immunized during {{pregnancy}} to the rabbit blood group factors G or g in {{five out of}} ten instances in which <b>the</b> red cells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fetuses</b> carried one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors absent in the mother.

40|$|Due to a {{surge in}} <b>the</b> {{availability}} <b>of</b> assisted reproductive techniques (ART), <b>the</b> incidence <b>of</b> multiple pregnancies is increasing. Preterm labor is a major complication in such pregnancies. Preterm delivery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>fetus</b> is often followed by delivery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining <b>fetuses.</b> However, conservative management and delayed interval delivery in <b>the</b> remaining <b>fetuses</b> might allow for fetal lung maturity and would reduce perinatal morbidities. A 32 -year-old female had a quadruplet pregnancy after receiving ART. Fetal reduction to triplet pregnancy was performed at 11 weeks <b>of</b> gestation. <b>The</b> remaining triplet pregnancy was stable until 29 weeks <b>of</b> gestation, when <b>the</b> first triplet was delivered after spontaneous rupture of membranes. Under intensive monitoring, <b>the</b> remaining 2 <b>fetuses</b> were delivered by cesarean section at 31 weeks <b>of</b> gestation. Only <b>the</b> first <b>fetus</b> had retinopathy after discharge. In conclusion, delayed interval delivery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining <b>fetuses</b> should be attempted after preterm delivery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>fetus...</b>|$|R
5|$|Another {{instance}} of population control is {{the prevalence of}} female infanticide. People in rural areas practiced female infanticide and selective neglect due to a preference of sons over daughters. Since the 1980s, roughly 200,000 female infants would be killed per {{year because of the}} preference for male children and the advancement in technologies such as ultrasound, which help to find out the sex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fetus.</b> In addition to female infanticide, girls are being unregistered or are abandoned by their families, which stops them from receiving education and legal benefits the government offered. These methods of controlling population have resulted in a huge gender gap in China.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the body}} of a 38-year-old woman, seven months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in an open field four days after she had disappeared from her residence in Panama. A plastic bag had been left over her head, and she had been gagged; the case was ruled a homicide. The body had suffered from the tropical heat and high humidity, and was bloated and highly discolored. At autopsy, the remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> were discovered in the woman's undergarments. Although the fetus was in a similar state of decomposition, the umbilical cord was intact and still attached to the placenta inside the uterus.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the silky shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryo exhausts its supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Relative to other viviparous sharks, the placenta of the silky shark is less similar to the analogous mammalian structure in that no interdigitation exists between the tissues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> and mother. Furthermore, the fetal red blood cells are much smaller than maternal blood cells, which is opposite the pattern seen in mammals. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right side) and two functional uteri, which are divided lengthwise into separate compartments for each embryo.|$|E
40|$|The safest {{and most}} {{practical}} method of administering long-term anticoagulants in pregnancy is uncertain because treat-ment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mother with vitamin K antagonists may be complicated by hemorrhage in <b>the</b> <b>fetus.</b> <b>The</b> effects on <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> <b>of</b> giving coumadin in preg-nancy was evaluated in rabbits.

5|$|There {{are also}} many {{cases where the}} remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> are found {{separate}} {{from the body of}} the mother, but expulsion was not through the birth canal, and separation of the two bodies may have been influenced by external environmental factors. The process of separation is so unusual that a specific term for the phenomenon may not have been proposed to the scientific community. These cases may have comparable results, but they are not cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
25|$|Cocaine, a small molecule, is able {{to cross}} the {{placenta}} into the bloodstream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fetus.</b> In fact it may be present in a higher concentration in the amniotic fluid {{than it is in}} the mother's bloodstream. The skin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> {{is able to}} absorb the chemical directly from the amniotic fluid until the 24th week of pregnancy.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{outbreak}} <b>of</b> infectious {{abortion in}} swine, {{probably the first}} reported from the eastern United States, {{was associated with a}} strain of Bacillus abortus growing rapidly on ordinary nutrient agar slopes without seal and presenting certain slight pathological deviations from <b>the</b> bovine form <b>of</b> disease in guinea pigs such as <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> necrotic, suppurating foci in spleen and lymph nodes. Agglutination tests, comprising both cross-agglutination and absorption procedures failed to distinguish the strain from the bovine type. <b>The</b> gross appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fetuses</b> from this outbreak was normal. <b>The</b> shreds <b>of</b> placentas obtainable indicated slight erosion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chorionic epithelium and some exudation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{quantified}} <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> diurnal rhythms {{in various}} computerized fetal heart rate parameters in normal pregnancies {{to assess their}} clinical relevance. STUDY DESIGN: Modified cosine analysis was applied to <b>the</b> outcomes <b>of</b> computerized analysis of continuous 24 -hour fetal heart rate recordings in 26 normal pregnancies. Diurnal rhythms in maternal heart rate and plasma hormones were assessed in 15 and 17 pregnancies, respectively. Correlations between maternal and fetal rhythms were calculated.
