50|$|While the Lebus family {{business}} continues to produce this equipment today, patents have expired and <b>other</b> <b>winch</b> manufacturers {{also use the}} Lebus system. Any drum with a parallel groove and two cross-over points is often generically called ‘a Lebus drum’, regardless of the manufacturer.|$|R
2500|$|Mechanised hauling {{devices are}} used on modern trawlers. Trawl winches, such as Gilson <b>winches,</b> [...] and <b>other</b> {{auxiliary}} <b>winches</b> are installed on deck {{to control the}} towing warps (trawling wires) and store them when not in use.|$|R
50|$|High lead logging is {{a method}} of cable logging using a spar, yarder and loader. It was {{developed}} by Oscar Wirkkala. It is accomplished with two lines (cables) and two winches (or cable drums). The mainline or yarding line extends out from one winch, while a second usually lighter line called the haulback line extends out from the <b>other</b> <b>winch</b> to a 'tail block' or pulley at the tail (back) end of the logging site, and passes through the tail block and connects to the main line. Butt rigging is installed where the two lines join and the logs are hooked to the butt rigging with chokers. The procedure is to wind up the main line and the logs are pulled in, wind up the haulback and the butt rigging is pulled out for more logs or another 'turn'.|$|R
2500|$|Departing Sydney on 16 July {{using only}} one engine to {{conserve}} fuel, Marion headed through the Strait of Belle Isle and began her oceanographic survey mission. Initially, only Smith and his executive officer, Lieutenant Noble Ricketts, had {{the knowledge of}} how to sample the Arctic waters for temperature and salinity but they trained additional men to handle the instruments used for the survey. At each stop the ship's position was noted and a sounding was made while the temperature and salinity samples were collected. With [...] of sample wire in the water, both winches that handled the sampling equipment failed on 27 July. The crew managed to retrieve the wire in the dark in three hours by using the anchor windlass to heave the line in. In the meantime, one failed winch was repaired using parts scavenged from a spare and the line was spooled back onto the winch. The repair evolution was completed by morning with one winch operational. By July 31, Danish officials in Greenland had radioed permission for Marion to put into Godthaab for repairs to the <b>other</b> <b>winch</b> and the crew worked through the day to remove the two ton winch to shore for repair and replace it on the deckhouse. Marion departed Godthaab that evening with repairs completed.|$|R
25|$|Tuna {{purse seiners}} are large purse seiners, {{normally}} over 45 metres, {{equipped to handle}} large and heavy purse seines for tuna. They have the same general arrangement as the American seiner, with the bridge and accommodation placed forward. A crows nest or tuna tower is positioned {{at the top of}} the mast, outfitted with the control and manoeuvre devices. A very heavy boom which carries the power block is fitted at the mast. They often carry a helicopter to search for tuna schools. On the deck are three drum purse seine winches and a power block, with <b>other</b> specific <b>winches</b> to handle the heavy boom and net. They are usually equipped with a skiff.|$|R
40|$|A wakeboard winch is a {{stationary}} device used to tow wakeboard riders through {{a body of}} water allowing riders to access locations that may be too shallow for boats or where motorboat restrictions apply. For this instance, the device will be intended to use on a small lake where motorized boats are prohibited but will also possess a transportable design so it may be used in <b>other</b> locations. <b>Winches</b> that can be purchased from manufacturers tend to be expensive and unaffordable for most people while many homemade winches tend to lack the same performance capabilities as manufactured winches. The principal investigator of this project will be responsible for designing, building, and analyzing a wakeboard winch that yields the performance of a manufactured device while being built with a minimal budget.

60|$|They {{were long}} pulling off to Mossamedes, {{and then were}} forced to wait for some minutes. She rolled, lifting her bilge-keels out of the water, and one must watch {{for a chance to}} hook on the tackles. At length a broken sea, smaller than the others, lifted the boat and Kit seized the {{swinging}} hook. The bowman was quick and got the <b>other</b> hook, a <b>winch</b> rattled, and the big boat went up. She struck the steamer's plates, but did not stop, and in a few moments the swivelling davits dropped her on the skids. Macallister and a steward lifted out the captain, and Kit went aft to see the launch hove up. Then he went to his room and for a time knew nothing more.|$|R
5000|$|Typhoon Gay {{is known}} to have passed {{directly}} over the Platong Living Quarters and then over the Seacrest. Both reported the calm during the eye of the storm. The Seacrest {{is known to}} have capsized after the eye passed over the ship and the weather abruptly turned severe again. At that time, the Seacrest was attached to one of its bow anchors and {{at least one of the}} other anchors in its eight anchor drilling mode anchor pattern. One of the survivors testified in his deposition that moments before the capsize, he had seen the ship's chief engineer at one of the ship's <b>other</b> anchor <b>winches.</b> The anchor winch was not working,so the chief engineer was trying unsuccessfully to cut through the anchor cable with a fire axe in an apparent attempt to free the ship from the anchor so that it could navigate and steam up the bow anchor cable thereby avoiding wind and waves on its beam. Caught by at least two anchors,the ship was left taking the predominant wind and the waves on its beam. The ship oscillated broadside to the predominant wind, and, during a series of high waves, coupled with gusty typhoon-strength wind, suddenly, but predictably, capsized to port.|$|R
25|$|The {{phrase is}} said to have {{originated}} one day when Coggeshall's town clock chimed 11 times at noon. When the villagers heard that the town clock at Lexden had struck 12 times at 11 o'clock, they rode to the town to collect the missing stroke. <b>Other</b> jobs included <b>winching</b> up a cow onto the church roof to eat the grass growing there, knocking down one of two windmills as there would not be enough wind for both of them, attempting to divert the course of the river with hurdles, hanging sheets over roads to prevent the wind from blowing disease into the town, chopping the head off a lamb to free it from a gate, removing stairs from a house to stop flood water entering and some appropriated from other 'fool centres', for example the classic 'fishing for the moon'.|$|R
40|$|As {{early as}} 1776, Thomas Pownall {{published}} {{a review of}} the Wealth of Nations {{in the form of a}} letter to its author, that may help us analyse a much-debated issue in our discipline: Adam smith's thought on colonies. Both friends and enemies of the empire took comfort in the Wealth of Nations. Accordingly, Smith's ambiguities on the subject have been pointed out by specialists, from Henry Brougham and Jeremy Bentham in the early days of the nineteenth century down to Bernard Semmel in 1970. On the <b>other</b> hand, Donald <b>winch</b> and <b>others</b> have forcibly argued that Smith's imperial 'project', so heartily supported later by J. S. Nicholson and the liberal imperialists, accounts for no more than a ballon d'essai. And the best textbooks in the history of economic thought at present coincide in placing Adam smith within the classical stream of hostility towards colonie...|$|R
50|$|Following {{military}} {{traction engine}} trials in 1902, the military authorities {{were looking for}} a tractor that could do what the steam tractor achieved without its demands on fuel and water. In 1903 the military held a competition with £1000 first prize for a tractor that must weigh under 13 tons ready for the road, could haul 25 tons for 40 miles at 3 mph average speed including gradients of 1 in 18, and should be capable of 8 mph with half load and be able to climb 1 in 6 slopes towing that half load. <b>Other</b> conditions included <b>winch</b> capability of 15 tons, and ability to cross 2 feet of water. The results of the trial were reported in The Automotor Journal. When the trials were held only one vehicle attended, the Hornsby Heavy Oil Tractor. Not only did it win the £1000 prize for meeting the criteria laid down, but it received a bonus of £180 for completing 58 miles towing its 25-ton load before requiring fuel or water.|$|R
60|$|Incapacity, {{declared}} {{by whatever}} authority, stands upon two principles: first, an incapacity {{arising from the}} supposed incongruity of two duties in the commonwealth; secondly, an incapacity arising from unfitness by infirmity of nature or the criminality of conduct. As to the first class of incapacities, they have no hardship annexed to them. The persons so incapacitated are paid by one dignity for what they abandon in another, {{and for the most}} part the situation arises from their own choice. But as to the second, arising from an unfitness not fixed by Nature, but superinduced by some positive acts, or arising from honorable motives, such as an occasional personal disability, of all things it ought to be defined by the fixed rule of law, what Lord Coke calls the golden metwand of the law, and not by the crooked cord of discretion. Whatever is general is better borne. We take our common lot with men of the same description. But to be selected and marked out by a particular brand of unworthiness among our fellow-citizens is a lot of all others the hardest to be borne, and consequently is of all <b>others</b> that act <b>winch</b> ought only to be trusted to the legislature, as not only legislative in its nature, but of all parts of legislature the most odious. The question is over, if this is shown not to be a legislative act.|$|R
