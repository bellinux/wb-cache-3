40|$|Abstract—This article {{presents}} a detailed overview and as-sessment of contact-free UV light discharge systems (UVDS) needed {{to control the}} variable electric charge level of free-flying test masses which are part of high precision inertial sensors in space. A comprehensive numerical analysis approach {{on the basis of}} experimental data is detailed. This includes UV light ray tracing, the computation of time variant electric fields inside the complex inertial sensor geometry, and the simulation of individual photo-electron trajectories. Subsequent data analysis allows to determine key parameters to set up an analytical discharge model. Such a model is an essential system engineering tool needed for requirement breakdown and subsystem specification, performance budgeting, <b>on-board</b> <b>charge</b> control software development, and instrument modeling within spacecraft end-to-end performance simulators. Different types of UVDS design concepts are presented and assessed regarding their robustness and performance. Critical hardware aspects like electron emission from air-contaminated surfaces, interfaces with other subsystems, and spacecraft operations are considered. The focus is on the modeling and performance evaluation of the existing UVDS on board LISA Pathfinder, an ESA technology demonstrator spacecraft to be launched in 2014. The results have motivated the design of a more robust discharge system concept for cubical test mass inertial sensors for future space missions. The developed analysis tools have been used for design optimization and performance assessment of the proposed design. A significant improvement of relevant robustness and performance figures has been achieved.

This charger is able to control the values of the load voltage and current and then, maintain them at a desirable value. A first converter is used to transform the grid 50 Hz electrical quantities into DC quantities. A second converter adjusts the levels to the values required by the battery and moreover, provides a galvanic isolation. The control of the first converter is realized by using a power factor corrector function. The control of the second converter allows supplying the battery with correct voltage and current values.

40|$|Electric Vehicle (EV) {{charging}} {{can only}} be conducted at specific places as of the dependence on the charging facilities. External charging facilities are usually bulky and expensive due {{to the use of}} low frequency modulation technique. For this reason, EV <b>on-board</b> <b>charging</b> system becomes a popular concept in nowadays due the improvement of high frequency (HF) power electronics [1].
