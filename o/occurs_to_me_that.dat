500|$|On May 3, Congressman George Smathers {{defeated}} liberal Senator Claude Pepper for the Democratic Senate {{nomination in}} Florida. Smathers' tactics included dubbing his opponent [...] "Red Pepper" [...] and distributing red-covered brochures, The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper, {{that included a}} photograph of Pepper with Marcantonio. Soon after Smathers' triumph in the primary, which {{in the days of}} the yellow dog South was tantamount to election, South Dakota Republican Senator Karl Mundt, who when in the House had served with Nixon on HUAC, sent him a letter telling him about Smathers' brochure. Senator Mundt wrote to Nixon, [...] "It <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> if Helen is your opponent in the fall, something of a similar nature might well be produced..." [...] Douglas wrote of Senator Pepper's defeat, [...] "The loss of Pepper is a great tragedy, and we are sick about it." [...] She also noted, [...] "What a vicious campaign was carried on against him. No doubt the fur will begin to fly out here too", and [...] "It is revolting to think of the depths to which people will go." ...|$|E

60|$|It <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you may perhaps know, or know of, {{a kind of}} {{man that}} I want to discover.|$|E
60|$|It never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{he could}} change. I felt so secure in his love. It never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> anyone could take him from me.|$|R
60|$|It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I {{also should}} like to know. In another thirty hours I was to find out.|$|R
60|$|It {{was just}} getting dark. The idea <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I might be {{followed}} again and attacked on the high-road.|$|R
6000|$|... "H-m-m!" [...] murmured Mr. Conant. [...] "It <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{a friend}} of Colonel Hathaway might desire a more luxurious home {{than that of the}} Widow Harrington." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> we {{must first}} find a chauffeur," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Merrick, [...] "and from my impressions of the inhabitants of Calais, that will prove a difficult task." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{look like}} it." [...] Gordon smiled. [...] "As it happened, I saw Miss Waynefleet {{crossing}} the clearing. It <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{she may have}} said something that set you thinking." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{think it}} <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I {{had already begun}} it, in my poor way: but it <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now, whether or no.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Miss Stanbury, she {{has given}} me an answer. But it has <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> young ladies are sometimes,--perhaps a little--" ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was such}} a very {{provoking}} question (for it had never in the most distant manner <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me),</b> <b>that</b> I said, snappishly,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "More am I," [...] he said, [...] "but I find I am dining {{with the}} Prime Minister at nine o'clock. It <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{you may have}} some {{influence}} with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{one of us}} is {{responsible}} for some irregularity in the work upon this ranch, and that the beast it a trifle uncertain in his moods," [...] said he.|$|E
6000|$|... "Agreed," [...] said Paul; [...] "but now it <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> our pork may be raw, {{and that}} we shall want fire to cook it. Have you got flint and steel in your pocket, Master Trench?" ...|$|E
60|$|She relapsed into silence. It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> having posted her {{thoroughly}} in my affairs, I {{was entitled}} to ask about hers.|$|R
60|$|It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I {{was in the}} {{presence}} of the aristocratic theory currently working as distinguished from my as yet unformulated intentions.|$|R

6000|$|Deringham {{laughed a}} little, {{somewhat}} mirthlessly. [...] "It <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> whatever our unknown relative may be he {{is a good}} rancher, if this is his handiwork," [...] he said. [...] "Well, we shall see him very shortly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I cannot claim {{any great}} {{experience}} in life," [...] the Saw-Horse answered for himself. [...] "but I seem to learn very quickly, and often it <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I {{know more than}} any of those around me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Why, hang it, it <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> by {{the time}} we reach New York you Twichells will be invading Europe and once more we shall miss the connection. This is {{thoroughly}} exasperating. Aren't we ever going to meet again? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, doctor; {{about your}} niece, you know: {{you must have}} views of some sort; that's of course. It <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> perhaps {{we are all in}} the dark together. If so, a little candid {{speaking}} between you and me may set it all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} heaven is like," [...] {{returned}} Ian musingly. [...] "It sometimes <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> we think and speak far too little of heaven, {{which is a}} strange thing, considering that we all hope to go there in the long-run, and expect to live there for ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was looking}} at the officer man, and {{scarcely}} noticed him. It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the attitude you complain of probably runs in the family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] he replied, [...] "it merely <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Mrs. Hunter {{wished to}} drive on. I thought I'd better point {{it out to}} you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was making}} these expressionist paintings, but it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I was more {{interested}} in jumping around the canvas than what was on the canvas." ...|$|R

Good, I've not brought evening dress or somebody else's footer clothes, as usually happens on these festive occasions.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your High and Mighty Spry and Flighty Majesty," [...] remarked the Captain respectfully, [...] "it <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{the weapons}} of the Pinkies are {{superior}} to our own.

6000|$|... "Do {{not feel}} it any more, sir; {{say what you}} wish, as you would have said it under any other circumstances; and pray believe this, the idea never <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> I have ground of {{complaint}} as regards the property; never.

6000|$|... "I am not aware, sir," [...] {{replied the}} wolf, [...] "that I require {{a pretext for}} loving chops; it never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> one was necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's less credible," [...] I said. And it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{the grey}} stretch of downland beyond {{must be the}} ridge {{to the west of}} Ridinghanger.|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} {{standing}} a little aside, seeing them both in profile. At <b>that</b> moment it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Razumov's face was older than his age.|$|R
