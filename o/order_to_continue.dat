When someone stole his guitar after he left it backstage overnight, Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro.|$|E
5|$|The most {{masculine}} {{women were}} not necessarily common, though they were visible so they tended to attract women interested in finding other lesbians.

Women who did not enter the military were aggressively called upon to take industrial jobs left by men, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> national productivity. The increased mobility, sophistication, and independence of many women {{during and after the}} war made it possible for women to live without husbands, something {{that would not have been}} feasible under different economic and social circumstances, further shaping lesbian networks and environments.|$|E

5|$|Bradstreet set {{out from}} Fort Schlosser in early August 1764 with about 1,200 {{soldiers}} and a large contingent of Native allies enlisted by Sir William Johnson. Bradstreet felt {{that he did not}} have enough troops to subdue enemy Native Americans by force, and so when strong winds on Lake Erie forced him to stop at Presque Isle on August 12, he decided to negotiate a treaty with a delegation of Ohio Native Americans led by Guyasuta. Bradstreet exceeded his authority by conducting a peace treaty rather than a simple truce, and by agreeing to halt Bouquet's expedition, which had not yet left Fort Pitt. Gage, Johnson, and Bouquet were outraged when they learned what Bradstreet had done. Gage rejected the treaty, believing that Bradstreet had been duped into abandoning his offensive in the Ohio Country. Gage may have been correct: the Ohio Native Americans did not return prisoners as promised in a second meeting with Bradstreet in September, and some Shawnees were trying to enlist French aid in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> the war.|$|E
5|$|Diarra {{earned his}} first call {{up to the}} under-21 team in August 2002 for a {{friendly}} match against Cyprus. He made his debut in the match as France cruised to a 1–0 victory.

5|$|In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> their efforts, the magnates took {{advantage}} of the earlier death of Tsarevich Dmitry (1591) under mysterious circumstances and of the appearance of False Dmitriy I, a pretender-impostor claiming to be the tsarevich. False Dmitriy was able to secure the cooperation and help of the Wiśniowiecki family and of Jerzy Mniszech, Voivode of Sandomierz, whom he promised vast Russian estates and a marriage with the voivode's daughter Marina. Dmitriy became a Catholic and leading an army of adventurers raised in the Commonwealth, with the tacit support of Sigismund III entered in 1604 the Russian state. After the death of Boris Godunov and the murder of his son Feodor, False Dmitriy I became the Tsar of Russia, and remained in that capacity until killed during a popular turmoil in 1606, which also eliminated the Polish presence in Moscow.|$|E
