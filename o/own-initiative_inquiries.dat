40|$|This article investigates {{whether the}} European Ombudsman {{acts as an}} ‘independent’ {{institution}} vis-à-vis the European Parliament (EP). This is a relevant question because while the Ombudsman is appointed by and reports to the EP, it can also conduct inquiries into {{the work of the}} EP, in instances of alleged maladministration. Based on the empirical examination of all decisions following an inquiry by the Ombudsman in cases against the EP for an eleven-year period (2004 – 2015), plus the review of two recent landmark <b>own-initiative</b> <b>inquiries,</b> we inductively construct three roles played by the Ombudsman in relation to the EP, namely: ‘arbitrator’, ‘transparency watchdog’, and ‘vessel for civil society concerns’. These roles are used to operationalize the concept of independence. We conclude that the Ombudsman acts independently and is not a mere auxiliary organ of the European legislature. This is most apparent in the ‘transparency watchdog’ role, where the European Ombudsman has ensured the release of information empowering citizens to hold the Parliament accountable, or—failing that—has stimulated debate concerning such information (for instance, on the MEPs’ financial allowances) both within the Parliament itself and in the wider public domain...|$|E

It also defines his relationship towards the European citizens and towards the various institutions at the European level. This thesis is focused on the description of the mechanisms of inquiries of the European ombudsman and on the characterization of various fields of these inquiries and also on more detailed description of the initiation, progress and conditions necessary for the successful conclusion of the case. Finally, this thesis deals with a specific <b>own-initiative</b> <b>inquiry</b> closed in 2011 as a demonstration of the work and achievements of this institution. Mainly English primary and secondary sources are used in this thesis. The sources basically consist of the Treaties on the European Union, the European Ombudsman's annual report, his publications, various articles on this subject or other Internet sources...|$|R
