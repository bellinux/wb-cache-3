500|$|As CNS, Vice Admiral Burrell had {{to contend}} with a threat by Defence Minister Athol Townley to disband the Navy's {{fixed-wing}} Fleet Air Arm capability by 1963, but gained approval for a major vessel re-equipment drive that was to include new submarines, destroyers, minesweepers, and auxiliaries. This led among other things to the procurement of British s, selected by Burrell when his original preference for an Australian-built craft proved too expensive, as well as s and the Navy's first purpose-designed hydrographic survey ship, [...] The re-equipment program also resulted in augmentation of the RAN's rotary-wing assets with Westland Wessex anti-submarine warfare helicopters. Most significant was the purchase of three [...] guided-missile destroyers, a decision of [...] "ingenuity and forethought" [...] on the part of Burrell and Navy Minister John Gorton, according to historian Tom Frame. The CNS and his minister enjoyed a close working relationship; Burrell declared that Gorton [...] "deserves <b>our</b> <b>thanks</b> for his efforts", and Gorton called Burrell [...] "one of the most honest, sincere and most dedicated sailors".|$|E
500|$|This was {{followed}} by an October 1801 anonymous review in the Monthly Mirror that argued, [...] "It is a matter to be lamented, that, in times like the present, a work of letters can rarely be reviewed upon the ground of its own proper merits... In the consideration of this romance, the judicious critic cannot but feel that one rule of good writing has been studiously observed. His work will not incur the censure passed by the late Mr. Collins upon his Persian Eclogues, namely, that, from erroneous manners, they were 'Irish.'" [...] The review continued, [...] "He tells us it is metrical... He will excuse our ears, but we cannot agree with him. Among the sins of our youth, we, like him, have traded in desultory versification, but have long been brought back to lyrical rhyme, and heroic blank verse. The reasons are obvious... We recommend his beauties to the esteem, and his faults to the forgetfulness, of every reader. Upon the whole, he has <b>our</b> <b>thanks</b> for much amusement, and some information." ...|$|E

2500|$|The QE2 {{returned}} to the UK in June 1982, where she was greeted in Southampton Water by The Queen Mother on board the Royal Yacht Britannia. Peter Jackson, {{the captain of the}} QE2 responded to the Queen Mother's welcome: [...] "Please convey to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth <b>our</b> <b>thanks</b> for her kind message. Cunard's Queen Elizabeth 2 is proud to have been of service to Her Majesty's Forces." [...] The ship underwent conversion back to passenger service, with her funnel being painted in the traditional Cunard orange with black stripes which are known as [...] "Hands" [...] for the first time, during the refit the hull's exterior was repainted an unconventional light pebble grey. [...] This colour proved unpopular with passengers, as well as difficult to maintain and so the hull reverted to traditional colours in 1983. Later that year, QE2 was fitted with a magrodome over her Quarter Deck pool.|$|E
