5|$|At {{the road}} bridge, German {{forces of the}} 9th SS had quickly {{surrounded}} Frost's battalion, cutting them {{off from the rest}} of the division. At around 09:00, the 9th SS Reconnaissance Battalion headed back toward Arnhem from south of the river, having concluded that it was not needed at Nijmegen. Though aware of the British troops at the bridge, it attempted to cross by force. In the resultant two-hour battle, it was beaten back with heavy losses; half of its armored vehicles were destroyed or knocked out and its commanding officer, Viktor Gräbner, was killed in action during the assault. German attacks carried <b>on</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> British perimeter at the Arnhem bridge for the rest of the day, but the British continued to hold.|$|E
5|$|Following his defeat, McCain {{returned}} to the Senate amid varying views about what role he might play there. In mid-November 2008 he met with President-elect Obama, and the two discussed issues they had commonality <b>on.</b> <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> same time, McCain indicated {{that he intended to}} run for re-election to his Senate seat in 2010. As the inauguration neared, Obama consulted with McCain on a variety of matters, to an extent rarely seen between a president-elect and his defeated rival, and President Obama's inauguration speech contained an allusion to McCain's theme of finding a purpose greater than oneself.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2004 {{victory in}} Allsvenskan, plans {{were made to}} {{construct}} a new stadium. In July 2005, Malmö FF announced that work was to begin on Swedbank Stadion, designed for 18,000 seated spectators and 6,000 standing. The stadium can also accommodate 21,000 as an all-seater for international and European games in which terracing is not allowed. Construction started in 2007 and was finished in 2009. The new stadium is located next to Malmö Stadion. Although there was still small-scale construction going <b>on</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> stadium at the time, the stadium was inaugurated on 13 April 2009 with the first home game of the 2009 season against Örgryte IS; Malmö FF's Labinot Harbuzi scored the inaugural goal in the 61st minute. The first Swedish championship won at the stadium occurred in 2010, when the club beat Mjällby AIF on 7 November in {{the final game of}} the season 2–0. Attendance at this game set the stadium record of 24,148. Swedbank Stadion is a UEFA category 4 rated stadium.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the very}} {{existence}} of the SPARTAN project and thus John's existence, was categorised as classified information. Many within the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), who were aware of this information, were strongly opinionated against the project, as the SPARTAN unit's proven versatility elevated them into direct competition with role-dedicated, established units. Since John emerged as the most exemplary Spartan from among the unit, he became the natural target of their sentiments. Antonio Silva, an officer from one such unit (ODSTs), exemplifies this attitude, and considers the Master Chief the freak product of an experiment that should never be repeated. Although the Chief resents Silva's dishonor to his fallen comrades' memory, he is also loyal to the chain of command, and remains quiet. Following the partial declassification of the SPARTAN project, John's heroic achievements caused the overall sentiment to lean in his favor. Despite these explorations of the character's personality, O'Connor {{said in an interview that}} revealing the face of the Chief is not as important as revealing the events going <b>on</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> character.|$|E
5|$|Written by Mervyn Haisman & Henry Lincoln, this storyline was {{considered}} around mid-1968. The story {{would be set}} in Scotland in Jamie's ancestral home, Castle McCrimmon, where the Doctor's old foe the Great Intelligence plans to use Jamie's body. At {{the end of the}} story Jamie would remain behind as the new laird. By late April 1968, it was clear that Frazer Hines would be leaving the series sometime during Season Six. One candidate for his departure story was Haisman and Lincoln's third Yeti serial, which they were working <b>on</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> start of June. Over the summer, however, the writers became embroiled in a dispute over copyright with the BBC regarding the Quarks, robot monsters which had appeared in their previous Doctor Who commission, The Dominators. The ensuing acrimony resulted in the abandonment of The Laird of McCrimmon during August 1968.|$|E

25|$|Although many hurling clubs exist worldwide, only Ireland has a {{national}} team (although it includes only players from weaker counties {{in order to}} ensure matches are competitive). It and the Scotland shinty team have played for many years with modified match rules (as with International Rules Football). The match is the only such international competition. However, competition at club level has been going <b>on</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world since the late nineteenth century thanks to emigration from Ireland, and the strength of the game has ebbed and flowed along with emigration trends. Nowadays, growth in hurling is noted in Continental Europe, Australia, and North America.|$|E
25|$|As senior {{artillery}} {{officer in}} the corps Smith acted as Chief of Artillery on numerous occasions from 1862 <b>on.</b> <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> same time the battery commanders of the division personally petitioned the Confederate States War Department, requesting a promotion for Smith. As the Confederate laws failed to provide enough field officers for the artillery, and lacked the urge {{to deal with the}} organisational shortages of its western armies, the petition was denied. By the Battle of Chickamauga in fall 1863 the five artillery batteries in the division were consolidated into a battalion under Smith's command; and he led his battalion into the Chattanooga Campaign.|$|E
25|$|Shenhav focuses his multiculturalist program mostly <b>on</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> postcolonialist discourse, {{but also}} {{includes}} the postmodernist and feminist ones. For Shenhav, identity is a dynamic, constructivist, random and non-primordial concept, and seeks to deconstruct {{the social and cultural}} constructions (which he sees as basically European) in order develop a perspective that would advance identity politics. Shenhav admits the existence of an asymmetry between the way in which he negates a substantive identity and criticizes the formation of a Hegemonic identity, while encouraging the formation of another substantive identity he wants to liberate within his identity politics. In his opinion, this can be morally justified since an analogy cannot be made between the oppressors and the oppressed and between the rulers and the ruled.|$|E

The episode twice refers to a fictional show Sports Shouting which features four panelists yelling at each other about sports.

500|$|The racecourse {{is shown}} on the map of 1848 as a roughly oval-shaped course {{extending}} around the west, north and east of the moor, crossing Moor Lane and carrying <b>on</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> ground that is now the home of Salford City F.C., roughly following the line {{of what is now}} Nevile Road. John Byrom (1692–1763), the owner of Kersal Cell, was greatly opposed to the racing and wrote a pamphlet against it, but the racing continued for fifteen years until, probably through Dr Byrom's influence, they were stopped in 1746, the year of the Jacobite rising. After this there is known to have been at least one race in 1750; regular fixtures recommenced in 1759, and were then held every year until 1846, when they were transferred to the New Barns racecourse. Racing carried on there until the new Castle Irwell Racecourse was built, just across the river from the moor, in Lower Broughton in 1847. Today part of the course can still be seen as a wide, well-worn path stretching from east to west along the northern side of the moor.|$|E

Coker and McKnight were added to nine prisoners who had been at a facility nicknamed [...] "Vegas": Jeremiah Denton, Harry Jenkins, Sam Johnson, James Mulligan, Howard Rutledge, Robert Shumaker, James Stockdale, Ronald Storz and Nels Tanner. While most of those among the Alcatraz 11 were senior officers, Coker was the youngest and most junior of those isolated from the other POWs. The 11, known as the [...] "Alcatraz Gang", were separated from other captives and placed in solitary confinement for their leadership in resisting their captors. In Alcatraz, each of the 11 men were kept in solitary confinement. Coker spent two years alone in a windowless concrete cell measuring 3 feet by 9 feet that had a light bulb kept <b>on</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> clock. He was locked each night in irons by a guard.
