5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution at the behest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Right.</b> Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E

In the years since Disco Demolition Night, some social critics have described the backlash as implicitly macho and bigoted, and an attack on non-white and non-heterosexual cultures.

25|$|Owing {{largely to}} the {{prominence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>right</b> in conservative politics in the United States, the Republican Party has taken positions regarded by many as outwardly hostile to the gay rights movement. Republicans have historically strongly opposed same-sex marriage (the party's overall attitude on civil unions is much more divided, with some in favor and others opposed), with the issue a galvanizing one that many believe helped George W. Bush win re-election in 2004. In both 2004 and 2006, congressional Republican leaders promoted the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposed constitutional amendment which would legally restrict the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples. In both attempts, the amendment failed to secure enough votes to invoke cloture, and thus, ultimately was never passed. As more states legalized same-sex marriage in the 2010s, Republicans increasingly supported allowing each state to decide its own marriage policy.|$|E

25|$|Goldwater {{returned}} to the Senate in 1969, and specialized in defense policy, bringing to the table {{his experience as a}} senior officer in the Air Force Reserve. In 1974, as an elder statesman of the party, Goldwater successfully urged President Richard Nixon to resign when evidence of a cover-up in the Watergate scandal became overwhelming and impeachment was imminent. By the 1980s, the increasing influence of the Christian right on the Republican Party so conflicted with Goldwater's views that he became a vocal opponent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>right</b> on issues such as abortion, gay rights, and {{the role of religion in}} public life. After narrowly winning re-election to the Senate in 1980, he chose not to run for a sixth term in 1986, and was succeeded by fellow Republican John McCain. A significant accomplishment in his career was the passage of the Goldwaterâ€“Nichols Act of 1986, which restructured the higher levels of the Pentagon by placing the chain of command from the President to the Secretary of Defense directly to the commanders of the Unified Combatant Commands.|$|E

40|$|The Lost Environmentalists? {{offers the}} first {{historical}} account delineating {{the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>right,</b> a major Christian fundamentalist led political movement and the hotly debated issue of environmental protection. Past scholars believe this political/religious group traditionally opposed environmental protection efforts due to their conservative militant culture and long-held theological interpretations that marginalized nature as a simple resource for humanity?s financial benefit. In contrast, I reveal new ways <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>right</b> understood nature while they promoted its protection throughout the 1970 s to the early 1990 s. During the latter decade, the movement ultimately adopted anti-environmentalist views. <b>The</b> <b>religious</b> <b>right?s</b> relationship with nature and environmental protection is indeed complex and evolved over time. In response to Earth Day 1970, fundamentalists initially wanted {{to participate in the}} Earth Day observance. However, the secular environmental movement drove fundamentalists away by blaming Christianity for the ecological crisis. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>right</b> continued promoting eco-friendly views as they built a national identity for themselves over the next twenty years. During this process, they portrayed nature sympathetically and in many cases understood it as equally important to economic prosperity. Accordingly, members participated in <b>the</b> twentieth anniversary <b>of</b> Earth Day in 1990. Almost simultaneously, <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>right?s</b> most powerful leaders adopted anti-environmental views from pro-business allies and sought to crush the eco-friendly groundswell. Successfully overturning the community?s nature sympathies took years and a variety of tactics including indirectly bullying congregants. This research reveals an entirely new understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>right?s</b> environmental views and also contributes a new caveat to the movement?s traditional definition as uncompromising religious militants. Furthermore, beyond filling a major gap in religious and environmental history and being of interest to political science, sociology and theology, ?The Lost Environmentalists? will enable the general public to understand why an important political group currently opposes environmental efforts...|$|R

40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{significant}} substantive challenges in <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Framework Convention concerns <b>the</b> effective protection <b>of</b> {{freedom of religion}} of minorities living in Europe. That <b>the</b> freedom <b>of</b> religion and political rights are among <b>the</b> founding pillars <b>of</b> democratic societies has been emphasized time and again by <b>the</b> European Court <b>of</b> Human Rights (ECtHR). <b>The</b> significance <b>of</b> these rights and freedoms for religious minorities is obvious due to <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> religion for their identity and existence. However, {{in an environment where}} both <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> minorities and <b>the</b> substantive scope <b>of</b> Articles 7 and 8 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Framework Convention are subject to debate, <b>the</b> effective protection <b>of</b> minoritiesâ€™ rights to exercise their religion individually and in association with the others is a major challenge to <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Advisory Committee. A discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>rights</b> and <b>the</b> corollary political rights of minorities in Europe raises at least two critical questions: <b>the</b> personal scope <b>of</b> application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Framework Convention and <b>the</b> substantive scope <b>of</b> freedom of religion protected under Articles 7 and 8 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Framework Convention. In other words, which groups should be deemed as religious minorities in this context and what kinds of rights should they be granted to be able to meaningfully exercise their freedom of religion? This chapter draws particular attention to <b>the</b> disconcerting implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ECtHRâ€™s judgment in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> Leyla Åžahin v.
