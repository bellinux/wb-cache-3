40|$|ABSTRACT. The net value (NV) of rice, as {{affected}} by drying costs and milling quality changes associated with harvesting rice at various moisture contents (MCs), was studied using a five‐year data set comprising eight cultivars harvested over {{a range of}} MCs from 11 southern U. S. locations. A quadratic relationship was used to characterize the change in NV across harvest MC (HMC); this relationship {{was due to the}} progressively‐increasing fee structure for commercial drying costs and the quadratic nature of head rice yield (HRY) changes with HMC. A sensitivity analysis revealed that as the price <b>of</b> <b>brokens</b> increased, there was a slight decrease in the HMC at which NV was maximized. Relative to the price <b>of</b> <b>brokens,</b> the optimum HMC was not influenced by fluctuations in head rice price. At a given HMC, the NV of a rice bulk increased with the price <b>of</b> <b>brokens,</b> and the extent of the increase was heavily influenced by the HRY versus HMC relationship. In all instances, the optimal HMC to maximize HRY (HMCopt‐HRY) was greater than the HMC corresponding to the maximum NV (HMCopt‐NV). When HMC, NV and HRY were plotted regardless of cultivar, location, or harvest year, the MC at which HRY was maximized was 21. 7 % whereas the MC at which NV was maximized was 18. 5 %, representing a 3. 2 percentage point difference between HMCopt‐HRY and HMCopt‐NV...|$|R
