5|$|Evangelis Zappas {{was often}} {{described}} as a solitary and eccentric personality, who had no children. On the other hand, {{he was a man}} of vision, determination and a patriot, who was well aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> his acts. His cousin, Konstantinos Zappas, was the executor of his will and he continued Evangelis Zappas philanthropic works through his legacy. Zappas's wish was to be initially buried in Romania, where he lived most of his life. But after four years his bones were exhumed and reinterred at the school's courtyard in Labovo where he was born, and his skull was enshrined beneath his memorial statue outside the Zappeion in Athens, Greece. A ceremony for the interment was held at 10am on 20 October 1888 at the Zappeion. Baron Pierre de Coubertin made a similar gesture by having his heart buried at Olympia.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} supply the boom in the iron and other industries, the output of mines {{increased}} massively. Near Bianjing, the Song capital, according to one estimate over one million households were using coal for heating, an indication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> coal use. Light industries also began to prosper during the Song, including porcelainwhich replaced potteryshipbuilding and textiles. Compared with the Tang, textile production increased 55%. The historian Xie Qia estimates that over 100,000 households were working in textile production by Song times, an indicator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the Song textile industry. The urbanisation rate of the Song increased to 12%, compared with 10% during the Tang.|$|E

25|$|The Cook Inlet region {{contains}} active volcanoes, including Augustine Volcano and Mount Redoubt. Volcanic eruptions in {{the region}} have been associated with earthquakes and tsunamis, and debris avalanches have resulted in tsunamis also.

25|$|The {{emerging}} picture {{here is that}} Abhinavagupta {{lived in}} a nurturing and protected environment, where his creative energies got all the support they required.

25|$|The case caused {{shock and}} concern {{among the public}} and in Parliament, partly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> Peter's injuries, and partly because Peter {{had lived in the}} London Borough of Haringey, North London, under the same child welfare {{authorities}} that had already failed seven years earlier in the case of Victoria Climbié leading to a public inquiry which resulted in measures being put in place in an effort to prevent similar cases happening.|$|E

25|$|Quantitative symbols give {{a visual}} {{indication}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the phenomenon that the symbol represents. Two major classes of symbols {{are used to}} portray quantity. Proportional symbols change size according to phenomenon’s magnitude, making them appropriate for representing statistics. Choropleth maps portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity (or value) of the color is evaluated by the eye {{as a measure of}} intensity or concentration.|$|E
25|$|The last {{column is}} the neutronicity of the reaction, the {{fraction}} of the fusion energy released as neutrons. This is an important indicator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> {{the problems associated with}} neutrons like radiation damage, biological shielding, remote handling, and safety. For the first two reactions it is calculated as (Efus-Ech)/Efus. For the last two reactions, where this calculation would give zero, the values quoted are rough estimates based on side reactions that produce neutrons in a plasma in thermal equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|On account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the Holocaust, many theologians have re-examined the {{classical}} theological views on God's goodness and {{actions in the}} world. Some believers and former believers question whether people can still have any faith in God after the Holocaust, {{and some of the}} theological responses to these questions are explored in Holocaust theology. Orthodox Jews have stated their reasons for why they believe the Holocaust happened and, to a more extreme degree, why they felt the Jews of Europe deserved to die.|$|E
30|$|More importantly, Fig.  6 and Table  2 {{show that}} <b>the</b> average <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ROCOF {{caused by the}} fault at {{different}} fault locations increases with <b>the</b> dispersion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inertia contributions. It {{can be seen from}} Fig.  6 and Table  2 that when the fault occurs at bus 30, 33, 35, or 36, <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ROCOF reduces with the increase in <b>the</b> dispersion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inertia contributions; however, when the fault occurs at bus 39, <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ROCOF increases with <b>the</b> dispersion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inertia contributions. Also, Fig.  6 shows that, in most of scenarios <b>of</b> inertia constants, <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ROCOF caused by the fault at bus 39 is much larger than that caused by the fault at bus 30, 33, 35, or 36. Thus, <b>the</b> average <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ROCOF caused by the fault at these buses increases with <b>the</b> dispersion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inertia contributions.|$|R
50|$|The 1932 Changma {{earthquake}} {{shows that}} apparently separate mapped intracontinental reverse faults may rupture simultaneously in an earthquake. Estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seismic hazard {{in an area}} based on <b>the</b> rupture <b>of</b> single reverse faults {{may lead to a}} major underestimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest possible earthquake.|$|R
30|$|For {{the passive}} overconstrained PMs, f {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitudes</b> <b>of</b> all constraint wrenches (including actuation wrenches), G_f^F is the coefficient matrix mapping the driving forces/torques and constraint forces/moments {{to the external}} loads, and the weighted matrix W is composed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stiffness matrices <b>of</b> each limb’s constraint wrenches, which cannot be actively selected. As a result, <b>the</b> solutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driving forces/torques and constraint forces/moments of passive overconstrained PMs are unique. For the active overconstrained PMs, f is composed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitudes</b> <b>of</b> all driving forces/torques, G_f^F is the coefficient matrix mapping the driving forces/torques to the generalized external loads, and <b>the</b> elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weighted matrix W can be actively given according to different optimization goals. Therefore, there are an infinite number <b>of</b> solutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driving forces/torques <b>of</b> active overconstrained PMs.|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} reasons why {{underwater}} archaeology can make {{a significant contribution to}} our knowledge of the past. In the shipwreck field alone, individual shipwrecks can be of significant historical importance either because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> loss of life (such as the Titanic) or circumstances of loss (Housatonic was the first vessel in history sunk by an enemy submarine). Shipwrecks such as Mary Rose can also be important for archaeology because they can form a kind of accidental time capsule, preserving an assemblage of human artifacts at the moment in time when the ship was lost.|$|E
25|$|By definition, if {{a current}} of one ampere flows {{in a pair}} of ideal {{infinitely}} long parallel conductors that are separated by a distance of one meter, then the magnitude of the force on each meter of those conductors will be exactly 0.2 micro-newtons. Furthermore, in general, the force will be proportional to the square <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the current and inversely proportional to the distance between the conductors. It also follows that, for railguns with projectile masses of a few kg and barrel lengths of a few m, very large currents will be required to accelerate projectiles to velocities of the order of 1000m/s.|$|E
25|$|Due to its link {{to other}} kinds of solar activity, sunspot {{occurrence}} {{can be used to}} help predict space weather, the state of the ionosphere, and hence the conditions of short-wave radio propagation or satellite communications. Solar activity (and the solar cycle) have been implicated in global warming, originally the role of the Maunder Minimum of sunspot occurrence in the Little Ice Age in European winter climate. Sunspots themselves, in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> their radiant-energy deficit, have a weak effect on terrestrial climate in a direct sense. On longer time scales, such as the solar cycle, other magnetic phenomena (faculae and the chromospheric network) correlate with sunspot occurrence.|$|E

25|$|A good {{description}} of the House as it stood before the siege {{is found in the}} Marquis's own Diary. Basing House stood on a rising ground, its form circular, encompassed with brick ramparts lined with earth, and a very deep ditch but dry. The lofty Gate-house, with four Turrets, looking Northwards, on the right hand thereof, without the ditch, a goodly building containing two fair courts; before them was the Grange, severed by a wall and common road, etc. Some idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the place may be founds when it is remembered that from a survey made in 1798 the area of the works including gardens and entrenchments, covered about fourteen and a half acres.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} rival {{tradition}} within Newtonian {{physics and}} engineering which sees weight as that which is measured when one uses scales. There the weight is a measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the reaction force exerted on a body. Typically, in measuring an object's weight, the object is placed on scales at rest {{with respect to the}} earth, but the definition can be extended to other states of motion. Thus, in a state of free fall, the weight would be zero. In this second sense of weight, terrestrial objects can be weightless. Ignoring air resistance, the famous apple falling from the tree, on its way to meet the ground near Isaac Newton, is weightless.|$|E
25|$|After a 1976 {{report by}} the United States National Academy of Sciences {{concluded}} that credible scientific evidence supported the ozone depletion hypothesis a few countries, including the United States, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, moved to eliminate the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans. At the time this was widely regarded {{as a first step}} towards a more comprehensive regulation policy, but progress in this direction slowed in subsequent years, due to a combination of political factors (continued resistance from the halocarbon industry and a general change in attitude towards environmental regulation during {{the first two years of}} the Reagan administration) and scientific developments (subsequent National Academy assessments that indicated that the first estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> ozone depletion had been overly large).|$|E
