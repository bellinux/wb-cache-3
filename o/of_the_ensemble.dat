5|$|Drive is a 2011 American neo-noir crime thriller film {{directed}} by Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. The screenplay by Hossein Amini {{was based on}} the eponymous 2005 novel by James Sallis. The film stars Ryan Gosling as an unnamed Hollywood stunt driver moonlighting as a getaway driver. He quickly grows fond of his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son, Benicio. Her debt-laden husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac), is released from prison, and hires him to take part in what {{turns out to be a}} botched million-dollar heist that endangers their lives.

5|$|In {{works from}} Jeux vénitiens, Lutosławski wrote long {{passages}} {{in which the}} parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> {{are not to be}} synchronised exactly. At cues from the conductor each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight on to the next section, to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined by the term aleatory are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski notated the music exactly; there is no improvisation, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.|$|E
5|$|Max Tegmark {{developed}} a four-part classification scheme {{for the different}} types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in various problem domains. An example of such a model is the chaotic inflation model of the early universe. Another is the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Parallel worlds are generated {{in a manner similar to}} quantum superposition and decoherence, with all states of the wave function being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, the multiverse evolves as a universal wavefunction. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> would be entangled in this sense.|$|E

5|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> lay in {{an amateur}} group of high-placed courtiers who {{performed}} {{for each other}} {{within the context of}} the Duke's informal musica secreta in the 1570s. The ensemble evolved into an all-female group of professional musicians, the concerto delle donne, who performed formal concerts for members of the inner circle of the court and important visitors. Their signature style of florid, highly ornamented singing brought prestige to Ferrara and inspired composers of the time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it began}} {{after the release}} of the first film, upon release of New Moon, Lautner and his co-stars Stewart and Pattinson transitioned to teen idol status, with Lautner {{particularly}} admired by teens for his new physical characteristics, becoming a sex symbol.

In between the second and third films in the Twilight series, Lautner was a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> cast in the movie Valentine's Day as Willy Harrington, acting alongside his rumored girlfriend at the time, American country pop singer Taylor Swift. The duo was nominated at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards for Best Kiss. Although it received generally negative reviews, the film grossed $213 million and had the second biggest opening in the United States for a romantic comedy film. Lautner presented at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and the 82nd Academy Awards. Lautner hosted Saturday Night Live on December 12, 2009, making him one of the youngest celebrity hosts in the show's history.|$|E
5|$|Game of Thrones has {{attracted}} record viewership on HBO {{and has a}} broad, active, international fan base.

The series has received 38 Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015 and 2016, {{more than any other}} primetime scripted television series. Its other awards and nominations include three Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation (2012–2014), a 2011 Peabody Award, and four nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama (2012 and 2015–2017). <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> cast, Peter Dinklage has won two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series (2011 and 2015) and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film (2012) for his performance as Tyrion Lannister.

5|$|In {{the early}} 13th century, 12th century {{characteristics}} remained prominent; however, many parts that were formerly plain became decorated. This change is {{observed in the}} Muktesvara Temple at Chaudayyadanapura (Chavudayyadanapura) and the Santesvara Temple at Tilavalli, both in the Haveri district. The Muktesvara Temple with its elegant vimana was renovated {{in the middle of}} the 13th century. In the Tilavalli Temple, all the architectural components are elongated, giving it an intended crowded look. Both temples are built with a dravida articulation. Apart from exotic dravida articulations, some temples of this period have nagara articulation, built in the stepped-diamond and the square plan natural to a nagara superstructure. Notable among temples with a stepped-diamond style are the Ganesha Temple at Hangal, the Banashankari temple at Amargol (which has one dravida shrine and one nagara shrine), and a small shrine that is a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> at the Mahadeva Temple. At Hangal, the architects were able to provide a sekhari superstructure to the shrine, while the lower half received a nagara articulation and depictions of miniature sekhari towers. The style of workmanship with a square plan is found at Muttagi and the Kamala Narayana Temple at Degoan.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang {{belongs to}} the larger unit/stratum of “knobbed gong-chime culture” {{prevalent}} in Southeast Asia. It {{is considered one of}} the region’s three major gong ensembles, alongside the gamelan of western Indonesia and piphat of Thailand, Burma, Cambodia and Laos, which use gongs and not wind or string instruments to carry the melodic part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ensemble.</b> Like the other two, kulintang music is primarily orchestral with several rhythmic parts orderly stacked one upon another. It is also based upon the pentatonic scale. However, kulintang music differs in many aspects from gamelan music, primarily in the way the latter constructs melodies within a framework of skeletal tones and prescribed time interval of entry for each instruments. The framework of kulintang music is more flexible and time intervals are nonexistent, allowing for such things as improvisations to be more prevalent.|$|E
5|$|Producer Orrin Keepnews {{attempted}} {{to record the}} quartet live at the Five Spot Café on two different occasions in 1958. His first recording <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> was of two sets during their July 9 show. Monk was disappointed with the recording and did not allow his label Riverside Records to release it, although it was released later after his death. Keepnews returned to the venue on August 7 when Monk performed an evening show in the club's overcrowded room set up with recording equipment. This yielded both Misterioso and Thelonious in Action, which was released first in 1958. The show {{was believed to be}} the first successful live recording of Monk's music, until the recording of his 1957 concert with Coltrane at Carnegie Hall was discovered and released in 2005. The two live albums from the Five Spot Café are the only recordings that document Monk's time with Griffin.|$|E

40|$|Recently we {{introduced}} {{a family of}} U(N) invariant random matrix ensembles which is a one-paramter (λ) extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> q-random matrix <b>ensembles</b> (RMEs), given by the asymptotic weak confining potential V(H) ∼ [H]^(1 +λ) cm-jpa 09. With numerical construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding orthogonal polynomials, we showed that <b>the</b> eigenvalue density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ensembles</b> deviates from <b>the</b> inverse power law and that <b>the</b> two-level kernel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ensembles</b> is qualitatively different from those <b>of</b> Gaussian and <b>the</b> critical <b>ensembles.</b> In this work, we make further efforts to characterize <b>the</b> two-level kernel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> λ-ensembles and discuss its various properties. To this end, we first show that <b>the</b> kernel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> λ-ensembles also possess an anomalous structure characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> critical <b>ensembles,</b> namely <b>the</b> ghost correlation peak. We then propose, albeit in a restricted regime, a form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two-level kernel which is distinct from <b>the</b> sine kernel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gaussian <b>ensembles</b> as well as <b>the</b> sinh kernel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> critical <b>ensembles.</b> We test <b>the</b> proposed form numerically and discuss its implications. In particular, we show that the case λ > 1 is qualitatively distinct from the case λ < 1, the latter decribing true fat-tail ensembles.

5|$|In January 2016, Wintory {{started a}} Kickstarter for a Journey Live concert tour, {{in which the}} fifteen-piece Fifth House Ensemble from Chicago will perform the music from the game while a player works {{their way through the}} game. The {{ensemble}} will react to the player's actions, using a specially-scored version of the soundtrack, composed by Patrick O'Malley with Wintory's oversight, that breaks the music into small pieces to enable this reaction. Wintory had wanted to do a performance of the Journey soundtrack in this interactive manner, but did not have the time to rework the soundtrack for this purpose. Wintory came to know Dan Visconti, the composer for Fifth House Ensemble, after Visconti published his praise for the Journey soundtrack and had encouraged other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> to play the game. The group saw how Journeys soundtrack had been used for various Video Games Live concerts and believed they could pull off Wintory's vision of an interactive concert, doing most of the reworking of the soundtrack under Wintory's direction. Sony has provided Wintory with a version of the game developed by Tricky Pixels that disables the music to allow the ensemble to provide this, and other modifications required for the concert performance. The Kickstarter was launched for $9,000 in funding for a four-city tour, but within a few days already surpassed its funding levels, allowing for more cities to be included.|$|E
