50|$|It {{was while}} {{serving in the}} army that O'Connor met comedian Red Skelton. The two became good friends and upon arrival back into the United States, Skelton offered O'Connor an announcing gig <b>on</b> <b>his</b> Raleigh <b>Cigarette</b> Program in 1945. O'Connor also stayed on when Skelton went to {{television}} with The Red Skelton Show.|$|R

50|$|The {{game was}} first {{described}} by the mathematicians Anatole Beck and David Fowler in the Spring 1969 issue of Manifold magazine (A Pandora's Box of Non-games page 32). Beck and Fowler note,It {{is clear that the}} ‘best’ time to say Finchley Central is exactly before your opponent does. Failing that it is good that he should be considering it.

50|$|Their {{first stop}} is Brest, where Moses goes to secure gigs {{for the band}} for money. Eventually, Johnson catches up with them {{at a hotel in}} Amiens and, posing as a record {{producer}} (under the name Raymond Lazar), provides them with money to play for a wedding at the hotel. Johnson goes to the bus to find the nose there, but is knocked unconscious by Igor. The next day, they learn of his real identity from the CIA logo <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cigarette</b> holder, and take him {{for the rest of the}} trip.|$|E
5000|$|The Farmer {{manages to}} toss Peter {{down into the}} cellar and slam the door shut. But Peter still has {{the end of the}} rope, and he {{continues}} tugging on it, eventually causing the Farmer to collapse on top of the trap door. With the weight of the body on top of the door, Peter is unable to escape. With nowhere else to go, he descends down into the cellar. He flicks <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cigarette</b> lighter to reveal the Farmer's equally insane and hideous wife and daughters standing all around him. He mutters defeated [...] "You must be joking" [...] before they set upon him, the lighter goes out and Peter screams as they attack him.|$|E
50|$|Claretie {{also wrote}} three operas {{for the music}} of Jules Massenet; La Navarraise (1894), based <b>on</b> <b>his</b> novel La <b>cigarette</b> and written with Henri Cain, Thérèse (1907), and Amadis (1922), a work begun by Massenet in 1895, but shelved and {{finished}} {{in the last years}} of his life and premiered posthumously.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are coming, aren't you?" [...] she said, {{looking over}} her {{shoulder}} into his eyes. And taking consent from his unchanging eyes, she let go his hand and slightly opened the door. He turned slowly, and taking his coat from a nail, slung it over his shoulders and drew it on. Then he picked up his hat, and put <b>his</b> foot <b>on</b> <b>his</b> half-smoked <b>cigarette,</b> which lay smoking still. He followed her out of the room, walking with his head rather forward, in the half loutish, sensual-subjected way of the Italians.|$|R

He played lap steel on Roger Alan Wades (songwriter for Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash) All Likkered Up (2005) record.

5000|$|Detective Flass - Once Jim Gordon's {{former police}} partner in Batman: Year One, Arnold Flass {{was one of}} the more corrupt {{officers}} on the force, only to get caught in criminal activity, fired and prosecuted for affiliating with the mob.

He was found dead outside, while <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cigarette</b> break, of a strip club called [...] "The Cheetah Room," [...] where he was working as a bouncer to make ends meet. Judging from scratches and bruises on his hands, it appeared that he attempted to put up a fight in his final moments. (Hangman Solution: Knows if you've been bad or good.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Several {{popular and}} {{well-known}} sweeteners were discovered by deliberate or sometimes accidental tasting of reaction products. Sucralose {{was discovered by}} a scientist mishearing the instruction to [...] "test" [...] the compounds as to [...] "taste" [...] the compounds. Fahlberg noticed a sweet taste on his fingers and associated the taste with {{his work in the}} chemistry labs at Johns Hopkins; out of that taste test came Saccharin. Cyclamate was discovered when a chemist noticed a sweet taste <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cigarette</b> that he had set down on his bench. Aspartame was also discovered accidentally when chemist Schlatter tasted a sweet substance that had stuck to his hand. Acesulfame potassium is another sweetener discovered when a chemist tasted what he had made.|$|E
5000|$|A similar {{game called}} [...] "Finchley Central" [...] was {{described}} in the Spring 1969 issue of the mathematical magazine Manifold, edited by Ian Stewart and John Jaworski at the University of Warwick. Douglas Hofstadter referred to the article in his book Metamagical Themas. The game {{is referred to as}} an [...] "English game" [...] in an article on [...] "non-games" [...] as follows:Two players alternate naming the stations of the London Underground.

6000|$|She {{was in a}} merry mood, {{and with}} {{surprise}} Dick observed her light a cigarette. He could count <b>on</b> <b>his</b> fingers the <b>cigarettes</b> she had smoked in a dozen years, and then, only under a hostess's provocation to give countenance to some smoking woman guest. Later, when he mixed a highball for himself and Graham, she again surprised him by asking him to mix her a [...] "wee" [...] one.|$|R
60|$|The haze {{about the}} sun was thicker. Puffs of fiery wind blew down the wady, a {{whirling}} pillar of dust broke and fell near the group, and the distant rumble of the surf got loud. It was very hot and the men were languid, but a sailor pulled a knife with an ornamented handle from his sleeve and began to sharpen it <b>on</b> <b>his</b> belt. Kit's <b>cigarette</b> had burned to a stump, {{and he looked at}} his watch. Juan got up.|$|R

5000|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by the same director as the Ghostbusters film, Ivan Reitman, and produced by Jeffrey Abelson. It features a young woman, played by actress Cindy Harrell, who is haunted by a ghost portrayed by Parker, roaming a nearly all-black house interior with vibrant neon designs outlining the sparse architectural and industrial features until the woman finally calls the service. It also contains footage from the film and features cameos from many celebrities of the day, including Chevy Chase, Irene Cara, John Candy, Melissa Gilbert, Ollie E. Brown, Jeffrey Tambor, George Wendt, Al Franken, Danny DeVito, Carly Simon, Peter Falk, and Teri Garr; all of whom exclaim the song's [...] "Ghostbusters!" [...] refrain when shown. Chase appears again after Garr, but chokes <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cigarette</b> {{when he tries to}} exclaim [...] "Ghostbusters!"; Franken also pops up in the house before the separately framed cameos begin.|$|E

6000|$|Beaton stopped biting <b>his</b> <b>cigarette</b> {{and looked}} at him. [...] "Don't want my letter? Oh, very good!" [...] he {{bristled}} up. He took <b>his</b> <b>cigarette</b> from <b>his</b> lips, and blew the smoke through his nostrils, and then looked at Fulkerson.|$|R
60|$|I did not. He fumbled {{again in}} <b>his</b> pockets for <b>cigarettes,</b> always refusing {{to switch on}} the light. I watched his face bowed to the match as he lighted <b>his</b> <b>cigarette.</b> He was still {{handsome}} in the ruddy light, but his features were coarser. I felt very sorry for him, but I saw that I could get no nearer to him, to relieve him. For some time I lay in the darkness watching the end of <b>his</b> <b>cigarette</b> like a ruddy, malignant insect hovering near his lips, putting the timid stars immensely far away. He sat quite still, leaning on the sofa arm. Occasionally {{there was a little}} glow <b>on</b> <b>his</b> cheeks as the cigarette burned brighter, then again I could see nothing but the dull red bee.|$|R
