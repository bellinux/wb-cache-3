Cochrane has developed his account in subsequent work, tying {{his work to}} cosmopolitan theory in a 2013 paper and developing an account of labour rights for animals in a 2016 paper. As of 2016, Cochrane {{is working on a}} book on the topic of animal rights and global justice, covering questions of cross-border obligations to nonhuman animals and the idea <b>of</b> <b>international</b> <b>politics</b> taking the rights of all sentient beings seriously.

25|$|Bullying: A bully may project his/her own {{feelings}} of vulnerability onto the target(s) of the bullying activity. Despite {{the fact that}} a bully's typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully's targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully's own sense of personal insecurity and/or vulnerability.

25|$|From {{the point}} of view <b>of</b> <b>international</b> <b>politics,</b> {{it has been argued that}} the end of the Cold War contributed to the break up of Yugoslavia because Yugoslavia lost its {{strategic}} international political importance as an intermediary between the Eastern and Western blocs. As a consequence, Yugoslavia lost the economic and political support provided by the West, and increased pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reform its institutions made it impossible for the Yugoslav reformist elite to respond to rising social disorder. The collapse of communism throughout Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union undermined the country's ideological basis and encouraged anti-communist and nationalist forces in the Western-oriented republics of Croatia and Slovenia to increase their demands.|$|E

Addressing the forum at its concluding session, he praised the WSF for demanding freedom in its most comprehensive form, and was happy that people had assembled under an important idea, rather than for narrow political ends; after reflecting on corporations displacing governments in various countries, and on how Mahatma Gandhi had fought British colonisers non-violently with {{the strength of the}} masses, he predicted that vocal masses the world over would successfully fight by non-violent means the capturing of the world's resources by a few corporations in the name of globalisation. He urged the people to struggle against power corporates and militarism and fight those aspects of globalisation which were against the interests of the people; he hailed people's power as a renascent factor <b>of</b> <b>international</b> <b>politics.</b>|$|E

500|$|The rise of Napoleon Bonaparte in France muted the [...] "revolutionary romanticism" [...] of Thomas Jefferson and his Democratic-Republican Party by {{the time}} he became {{president}} in 1800. Jefferson came to see the war between France and Britain as a battle between the [...] "tyrant of the land" [...] and the [...] "tyrant of the ocean", perceiving each state's military objective as the moral equivalent of the other. (The president was denounced by the 14-year-old William Cullen Bryant, who called him [...] "Napoleon's slave" [...] and a [...] "willing vassal to imperious France".) Jefferson's developing view <b>of</b> <b>international</b> <b>politics</b> led him to observe that the United States should retreat from intercession in European affairs (for which he had been a lukewarm advocate) and pursue a more-modest, less-committed course. He believed that American commercial power would allow it to pursue an independent course unfettered by conventional diplomacy, writing to a protégé: ...|$|E
500|$|During the Cold War, the {{modernization}} theory and development theory developed in Europe {{as a result}} of their economic, political, social, and cultural response to the management of former colonial territories. European scholars and practitioners <b>of</b> <b>international</b> <b>politics</b> hoped to theorize ideas and then create policies based on those ideas that would cause newly independent colonies to change into politically developed sovereign nation-states. However, most of the theorists were from the United States, and they were not interested in Third World countries achieving development by any model. They wanted those countries to develop through liberal processes of politics, economics, and socialization; that is to say, they wanted them to follow the liberal capitalist example of a so-called [...] "First World state". Therefore, {{the modernization}} and development tradition consciously originated as a (mostly U.S.) alternative to the Marxist and neo-Marxist strategies promoted by the [...] "Second World states" [...] like the Soviet Union. It was used to explain how developing Third World states would naturally evolve into developed First World States, and it was partially grounded in liberal economic theory and a form of Talcott Parsons' sociological theory.|$|E
500|$|In 2011 Cochrane {{became a}} {{founding}} member of the Centre for Animals and Social Justice (CASJ). The CASJ is a think tank that aims to bring academics and policy makers together with a view to understanding and furthering the social and political status of nonhuman animals. In January 2012 Cochrane became a faculty member in the Department of Politics at the University of Sheffield, first as a lecturer in political theory, and then as a senior lecturer in political theory. His second book, Animal Rights Without Liberation, was released that year by Columbia University Press. The book is based upon the research he completed during his PhD at LSE, and offers an extended defence of the theoretical basis and practical consequences of his interest-based rights account of animal ethics. In 2013 he edited a special section in the journal Global Policy entitled [...] "International Animal Protection"; the section included articles by the philosopher Oscar Horta, the environmental law scholar Stuart R. Harrop and the animal law scholar Steven White, with an introduction by Cochrane. He also contributed to the inaugural issue of the journal Law, Ethics and Philosophy as a part of a symposium on Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka's Zoopolis. Cochrane's paper argued for a [...] "cosmozoopolis", a cosmopolitan alternative to Donaldson and Kymlicka's proposal for a [...] "zoopolis"—a picture of a mixed human/nonhuman animal state with group-differentiated political rights for nonhuman animals. A reply to Cochrane's piece (as well as the other contribution, by Horta) from Donaldson and Kymlicka was also included. In 2014, he was named a BBC Radio 3 New Generation Thinker for his work on animal rights. As of 2016, Cochrane is working on a book on the topic of animal rights and global justice, covering questions of cross-border obligations to nonhuman animals and the idea <b>of</b> <b>international</b> <b>politics</b> taking the rights of all sentient beings seriously.
