5|$|Methods for {{controlling}} {{the spread of}} Armillaria root rot include physical removal of infected trees, stumps and large roots; fumigation of soil around infected hosts; and injection of fumigants directly into infected hosts. These methods are often not practical due to high cost, introduction of toxic chemicals that affect other organisms, or health and safety issues for the operator. Biological control is another method that has been investigated to control root rot caused by A.luteobubalina. In one study, thinning stumps of Eucalyptus diversicolor were simultaneously inoculated with A.luteobubalina {{and one of the}} saprobic wood decay fungi Coriolus versicolor, Stereum hirsutum and Xylaria hypoxylon; all three fungi significantly reduced infection by A.luteobubalinea. These results were echoed in another study of stumps in karri regrowth forests, where it was shown that the presence <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>wood</b> decay fungi suppressed the growth of A.luteobubalina on the stump base.|$|E

A study of the reproductive strategies of Xeris spectrum showed that the females often lay their eggs on wood where other wood wasps of species with symbiotic fungi have already laid their eggs. This allows the Xeris spectrum larvae to benefit from the fungi. In addition, adult Xeris spectrum emerge from their holes at two different times: one group emerges in summer with the species <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>wood</b> wasps, while the other group emerges the next spring.|$|E
500|$|The nest is {{in a tree}} cavity, {{usually an}} old {{woodpecker}} hole, but sometimes of natural origin. Occasionally the female will enlarge an existing hole in rotten wood. The nest site is typically [...] above the ground and has a deep base of pine bark or chips <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>wood,</b> rarely supplemented with dry plant material. If {{the entrance to the}} hole is too large, it is plastered with mud, clay and sometimes dung to make it smaller. A small entrance and large interior, together {{with the use of a}} deep layer of wood chips in which to bury the eggs and small young when the adults leave the nest, may be adaptations to reduce the chance of predation. Nests with small entrance holes are most successful. Locally, a small entrance may make it less likely that the nest will be taken over by common starlings. The female undertakes most of the work, and often plasters the inside of the cavity too, taking up to four weeks to complete the construction. A nest is often re-used in subsequent years.|$|E

Therefore, this is an important economic segment of the country. However, due to global economic trends, and also due to inadequately developed and low production efficiency, insuffi cient use of capacities and underdeveloped production of higher processing stages, the total income of the industrial wood processing is relatively low with respect to the potential of raw materials.
