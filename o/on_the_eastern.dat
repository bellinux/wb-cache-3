5|$|On {{his way to}} the Eastern Front, Müncheberg {{travelled}} to Berlin {{where he}} briefly served {{on the staff of the}} General der Jagdflieger Galland discussing air combat tactics and how to lead a fighter wing. On 26 July 1942 he participated in the German track and field championships, starting for the ASV Köln in the decathlon. Müncheberg finally arrived <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> Front in early August 1942 where he was welcomed by the Geschwaderkommodore of JG51, Major Karl-Gottfried Nordmann. Initially Müncheberg believed that combat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> Front was child's play in comparison to the Western Front. In the first four weeks his aircraft was twice severely damaged in combat. His first major task was re-equipping JG51 with the Fw190. Under his leadership JG51 became the first fighter wing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> Front to equip with this type. He claimed his first victories in the east on 3 August 1942, shooting down two Petlyakov Pe-2 dive bomber near Rzhev.|$|E
