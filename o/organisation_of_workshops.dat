50|$|As {{one size}} {{does not fit}} all, AITIC’s personalised {{approach}} to assist {{the representatives of the}} LACs to better understand the rules of the MTS has been its trademark. One of the best known examples of the tools AITIC has developed to assist the LAC representatives is its Glossary of Most Commonly Used International Trade Terms with Particular Reference to the WTO, which is in its second edition and has been translated into the three official languages of the WTO (English, French and Spanish) and also into Portuguese, Russian and Macedonian. The agency’s flexible structure allows it to provide tailor-made services to address the particular needs of the LACs for information and analysis {{on a wide range of}} issues concerning trade and development in the context of the WTO. Examples of such services are: <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>workshops</b> and “Flash Meetings”, on topics of interest to the LACs (i.e., Safeguards, Services, WTO Rules), publishing information notes (e.g., Aid for Trade, the Enhanced Integrated Framework for LDCs). In addition, its Official Fellowship Programme provides on-the-job training for LAC officials. AITIC’s recent capacity building programmes have included courses for Geneva-based delegates on Services and Agriculture. Most of the AITIC activities (and website) are provided in the three official languages of the WTO. Finally, LACs have unrestricted access to the facilities of the Non-Residents' Unit. AITIC was an initiative of Switzerland's federal authorities to assist resource constrained developing countries and economies in transition to have a more active trade diplomacy. Originally set up as an association under Swiss private law, AITIC was transformed into an intergovernmental organisation in 2004 and has been funded during its first five-year budgetary cycle by seven Sponsoring Members (Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK). At present, AITIC has 59 Participating Members and four in the process of accession. AITIC has been the subject of two external evaluations by a Dutch consultancy, ECORYS, one in 2004 and the most recent one in 2007. A “perception audit” was performed by Burson-Marsteller in 2007.|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: This study used the descriptive research strategy to describe the experience of information literacy among professional nurses in the Ho Municipality of Ghana. It used the purposive sampling method to select the various health facilities and the professional nurses. A total of 138 questionnaires out of 151 questionnaires that were administered were retrieved. The responses were presented and analysed based on the objectives of the study. Findings: The study discovered that nurses perceive EBP as good; and are privy to various information sources and resources but have some limitations that hinder the efficient and effective adoption of EBP in their profession. Research limitations/implications: Time constraints could not allow the researcher to cover all the professional nurses in the Municipality. Practical implications: The study recommends the introduction of information literacy course in the curriculum of the various nursing colleges/schools; the establishment of resourced libraries and information centres in the major health facilities; <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>workshops</b> on information literacy and EBP for practising nurses; subscription of medical databases by the major health facilities; and the encouragement of nurses to develop the culture of reading.

Although in recent years the approach to reduction of fertility has changed from narrow family planning to a broad based reproductive health approach, it is being increasingly felt that Bangladesh’s population policy should encompass other equally important issues which have wide implications for the development process and the quality of life of people of Bangladesh. To address some of the related pertinent issues the Centre for Policy Dialogue has initiated a programme which aims at undertaking a series of studies covering the broad area of Population and Sustainable Development. The major objective of these studies is to enhance national capacity to formulate and implement population and development policies and programmes in Bangladesh, and through close interaction with the various stakeholder groups, to promote advocacy on critical related issues. The programme which is scheduled to be implemented by the CPD between 1999 and 2002 shall address, inter alia, such issues as population dynamics and population momentum and their implications for education and health services, the nexus between population correlates, poverty and environment, impacts of urbanisation and slummisation and migration, as well as human rights.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{knowledge}} economies, research is recognised as a catalyst for accelerated national growth. Many countries are therefore investing hugely in university research. However, in developing countries especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, university research is fraught with a myriad of challenges making the research activities of academics weakened and sometimes neglected. Using mainly primary data gathered through interviews, this study sought to examine the perceptions and experiences of academic staff at the University of Ghana on their research activities. The findings of the study indicate that research organisation at the University of Ghana is faced with challenges arising out of the highly individualised research activities of the academics making coordination a big challenge which is compounded by the lack of research policy at the University. In addition to inadequate funding for research, the findings reveal that academics at the University of Ghana have little time to conduct research due to the heavy teaching load and sometimes academics engaging in extra jobs to augment their salaries. Poor research infrastructure was also found to be a major hindrance to the research activities of the academics. The study also found that attempts are being made by the University of Ghana to improve upon the research activities of academics through <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>workshops</b> to sharpen their research skills and the establishment of the Research and Conference Fund which offer grants to academics. On the whole, the study found that the research environment at the University of Ghana is not favourable for research and needs significant improvement. The study therefore recommends that the government as a matter of urgency should support the university’s research activities by providing budgetary support and investing in research infrastructure. Attempts should be made by the University of Ghana to lessen the heavy teaching loads of academics to give them time to conduct research...|$|E
40|$|M. Ed.) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2003 The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the possible training needs of the school governing bodies so that they can play their roles efficiently. Education can no longer be led by the producers, namely the academic theorists, the administrators and the educators' unions. Education must be shaped by the users, by what is good for the individual child and what hopes are held by parents. If power is to be moved, then it has to be managed, by implication, this management is to be by the users represented by the governors. Governing bodies have to take ownership of their schools to make sure that quality education is provided. In order to be effective democratically and managerially, the need for training should be recognized. The responsibilities for governing bodies are so important and complex that a governor cannot be expected to discharge them effectively without some training going beyond the normal process of picking up the job by doing it. The empirical investigation was employed to determine the training needs and strategies of the school governing bodies. Literature survey was also employed to determine the possible problems preventing the governing bodies to manage effectively. The population involved in this study was confined to principals, educator governors, parents, learners and co-opted members. The results of 210 respondents were analyzed. The findings revealed that the governing bodies did not know what to do and what not to do (i. e. they do not know their job description). Findings more over revealed that the governing bodies need to be empowered through extensive training. Recommendations made by the respondents on how training of school governing bodies should be done are also expounded.

Under the prospect of a warming climate (IPCC, 2007), it is important to assess the past and future stability of the cryosphere, particularly after ice core records identified a direct link between variations in CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere and palaeotemperatures. This special issue of Global and Planetary Change developed largely from contributions presented at the EGU meeting in Vienna, Austria ([URL] 13 – 18 April, 2008), and at the International Geological Congress (IGC) Conference in Oslo, Norway (www. 33 igc. org/; 6 – 14 August, 2008) where we organised sessions designed to investigate the many orders and scales of variation of Antarctic ice sheets and palaeoclimate from Antarctic and Subantarctic records, from outcrop studies, deep sea drilling, continental margin drilling and seismic investigations, permafrost and ice core drilling. This special issue of Global and Planetary Change continues a series of related special issues and a book (Florindo et al., 2003, 2005; Barrett et al., 2006; Florindo et al., 2008; Florindo and Siegert, 2009), all of which are linked to the Antarctic Climate Evolution (ACE) project.

40|$|Od prve bijenalne manifestacije MUVI: muzeji–video– film, održane 2006. godine, nastojali smo se razvijati ne prestajući stalno uključivati nove oblike komunikacije i prezentacije audio-vizualnih priloga. Prikazivački program, predavanja i susreti filmskih i muzejskih autora i kustosa bili su inicijalna platforma za razmjenu znanja. Potom se krenulo s prikazivanjem inozemnog programa, organizacijom radionica, od 2012. i s festivalom filmova snimljenih mobitelom MUVIMOBIL, a od posljednjeg MUVI-ja 2014. godine manifestacija je proširena multimedijskim blokom MUVI lab, kojim je prošireno istraživanje pokretnih slika i na multimedijske projekte (na web-stranice, igrice, 3 D animacije, holograme, mobilne aplikacije, audiovodiče, interaktivne kioske, online izložbe, virtualne muzeje, blogove [...] .). Tijekom pet MUVI-ja (2006., 2009., 2010., 2012., 2014.) u prikazivačkom dijelu programa sudionici su mogli vidjeti oko 250 videa nastalih u produkciji hrvatskih i inozemnih muzeja, a sudjelovalo je tridesetak vanjskih suradnika/suradnica iz Hrvatske i inozemstva. From {{the first}} of this {{biennial}} series, the 2006 MUVI: museums-video-film, the event was announced as a research project. MUVI has gone on along this path and developed through all the five events since then, without ceasing constantly to involve new forms of communication and presentation of audiovisual contributions. The screening programme, the lectures and the meetings of film and museum authors and curators were the initial platform for the exchange of knowledge. After that a start was made with the screening of a foreign programme, with the <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>workshops,</b> and from 2012 with a festival of films shot on mobile phones, MUVIMOBIL. From 2014 came the multimedia block MUVI lab, which expanded research into moving images to multimedia projects (Web sites, games, 3 D animations, holograms, mobile apps, audio guides, interactive kiosks, online exhibitions, virtual museums and blogs). During these five MUVIs, in the screening section of the programme, some 250 videos produced by Croatian and foreign museums have been shown, and in the programme of the project, some thirty consultants, from {{at home and abroad}} took part. The objective in the beginning was merely to start off research into the extent to which and in which way film was featured in museums, and above all to make the first contacts with heritage establishments that with their guidelines and suggestions {{might be able to help}} us preserve it. We are also of the opinion that the event itself, however much it has attempted to collect as many as possible of the films and videos created in the two-year intervals, did not alas manage to provide a complete image of the extent to which this medium is used in museums. It was observed that very often museums publish their videos on the many Internet hosting sites (Vimeo, YouTube, Facebook and so on). There can be no doubt that at the current time it is very desirable to use these free services and promote the work of the museums, although this writer concludes that publication on these sites does not provide a sufficiently professional archiving procedure, since they are not entirely reliable – there is always a chance that for some reason they will close down, and all the content will become inaccessible. With technological advances, we also have to face up to the nature of these very unstable media, and the problem of the readability of files and their usability in the future. As well as a synthesis of work on MUVI to date, the paper has also shown the results of research into information from the Online Register of Museums which is run by the Museum Documentation Centre, and collected by the means of a questionnaire. Analysis of the results provided an insight into the current situation related to documentation collections of AV holdings, the number of museum professionals dealing with processing them and the number of units that museums keep in these collections. At the end of the article a short review is made of projects in progress: from the pondering of a digital repository to a look at the test phase of a portal providing online access to museum films...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSigillated pottery {{is often}} used in {{archaeology}} to date sites but it also supplies information on the living customs and economic capacities of consumer communities {{as well as on}} interprovincial trading relationships. The stamps on smooth sigillated pottery provide valuable evidence on the <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>workshops</b> and their production. Their use varied from region to region and from period to period, both in terms of frequency (the proportion of smooth stamped vases) and nature (the types of stamped vases, the function of the stamps, the potter represented). They are also a very good indicator of the commercial relationships established in turn between the workshops of Gaul, Germany, the Danubian regions (chosen for this study) and Pannonia. From {{the time of the first}} research undertaken in Pannonia at the end of the 19 th century up until recent excavation work, the corpus of the stamps has been progressively enhanced, in particular thanks to studies of such large sites as Carnuntum, Salla, Brigetio, Poetovio, Budaörs, Baláca, Páty, Aquincum, Gerulata, Gorsium, and Vindobona, the sigillated pots of which have sometimes been the subject of systematic publication. However, though the data offer increasing study potential, it has not yet been possible to make a report on the entire province. As things stand, to look up the distribution of a potter's production in Pannonia necessitates trawling through a scattered and difficult to access bibliography. One of the purposes of this article was thus to gather the data pertaining to the whole province in one place, a development that I hope will be of particular help to foreign researchers. A total of 2043 stamps are presented here, of which approximately half are reproduced. Each is identified and classified by potter, followed by a detailed analysis of the commercialisation and use of sigillated pots made in western workshops. A statistical and cartographic study shows the trends of the numbers of stamps in circulation in the Province. The consumption of sigillated pots is initially studied in relation to the consumer societies. It required the analysis of the best known sites in Pannonia and comparison of the appearance of the sigillated pots in the different types of communities (civil, military, indigenous, rural, urban). It is noted that at certain moments the communities with strong economic and social ties to the army (especially on the ripa Pannonica) were those that had the greatest purchasing power and the greatest demand. A strong link can also be established with the location of the urban centres on the main routes by which sigillated pots were diffused in Pannonia. The question is then broached from a chronological point of view in order to retrace the history of the trade in sigillated pottery coming from different groups of western workshops. Several large workshops were favoured for trading purposes in Pannonia (La Graufesenque in particular during the reigns of Domitian and Trajan, Lezoux between 140 and 170, Rheinzabern between 180 and 250). They later dominated the Pannonian market even though workshops like Banassac, les Martres-de-Veyre, Heiligenberg, Westerndorf and Pfaffenhofen also played a role in imports. Changes that occurred in the organisation of the supply of the Pannonian markets were certainly linked to the dynamism of the workshops but they were also strongly influenced by the economic, social and historic conditions extant in the province. Military events were of major incidence : the wars against the Dacians, which followed the securing of the river trade and the construction of a line of fortifications on the ripa, entailed a concentration of the army on the Danube and created a favourable context for increasing imports from southern Gaul up the river. Conversely, the disturbances caused by the wars with the Marcomans and Sarmatians largely contributed to the fact that the products of the Lezoux workshops were no longer found in the markets of Pannonia. In other cases imperial policy reinforced the consumer communities, for example, through the urbanisation campaigns promoted during the reign of Hadrian (a period during which imports from Lezoux rose) and the Severan dynasty, and as a result of the favours bestowed and money spent by the emperors on the army in this strategically located region (which brought about the domination of Rheinzabern sigillated pots in the sites of Pannonia). At certain times during periods of particular prosperity demand was so great that it could not be fully satisfied by the workshops that controlled the market, and these favourable circumstances allowed other workshops to benefit. For instance, the workshops of eastern Gaul between the years 135 and 160 / 165. Westerndorf and Pfaffenhofen equally profited during the second golden age in the Severan dynasty and Pfaffenhofen benefited too from its position in the same taxation zone. All these developments in turn influenced the structure of the pottery's distribution channels, encouraging the development of certain routes, such as the amber route, the diagonal Aquincum-Poetovio way and the Danubian axis. In parallel, the dynamism of the centres of consumption on these routes increased : the rise of the Danubian axis reduced the importance of Neviodunum and Siscia, which were situated on the ancient trading routes out of Italy, while Aquincum and Carnuntum prospered as commercial ports. The rise and fall in intensity of consumption of sigillated pottery in urban centres is reflected in the proportions of stamps representing different groups of workshops : the composition of the goods varies greatly between sites in the south and the west of the province and those along the ripa. This study might be furthered by analysis of other aspects relating to the importation of sigillated pots in Pannonia, for example, from the standpoint of consumption, or the types of pots (forms, size, usage) used for living purposes and in the necropolises, or perhaps from the perspective of the manufacturers, and the commercial relations between the officina and the potters. La céramique sigillée est bien souvent utilisée en archéologie pour dater les sites, mais elle donne également des informations sur les modes de vie et les capacités économiques des communautés consommatrices ainsi que sur relations commerciales interprovinciales. Les estampilles sur les sigillées lisses sont des témoins précieux de l'organisation des ateliers et de la production. Leur utilisation a varié selon les régions et les époques, à la fois en fréquence (proportion des vases lisses estampillés) et en nature (types de vases signés, fonction de l'estampille, personne représentée). Elles sont également un très bon indicateur des relations commerciales établies tour à tour entre les ateliers de Gaule, de Germanie, des régions danubiennes (choisis pour cette étude) et la Pannonie. Depuis les premières recherches faites en Pannonie à la fin du XIXe siècle jusqu'aux fouilles récentes, le corpus des estampilles s'est progressivement enrichi, notamment grâce aux études de grands sites tels que Carnuntum, Salla, Brigetio, Poetovio, Budaörs, Baláca, Páty, Aquincum, Gerulata, Gorsium, Vindobona, dont les sigillées ont parfois fait l'objet de publications systématiques. Néanmoins, bien que le matériel soit de plus en plus riche, aucune synthèse n'a encore pu être faite pour la province entière. À l'heure actuelle, si l'on souhaite retrouver la distribution d'un potier en Pannonie, on est confronté au dépouillement d'une bibliographie dispersée et peu accessible. L'un des objectifs de cet article est donc de proposer un recueil regroupant les données pour l'ensemble de la province, qui pourrait notamment être utile aux chercheurs étrangers. 2043 estampilles sont présentées ici, environ la moitié avec leur reproduction. Chacune est identifiée et classée par potier, afin dans un second temps, de proposer une analyse fine de la commercialisation et de la consommation des sigillées provenant des ateliers occidentaux. Une étude statistique et cartographique permet de retracer les évolutions des quantités d'estampilles en circulation dans la Province. La consommation des sigillées est tout d'abord appréhendée du point de vue des sociétés consommatrices. Il s'agit d'analyser les sites les mieux connus de Pannonie et de comparer l'arrivée des sigillées dans les différents types de communautés (civiles, militaires, indigènes, rurales, urbaines). On remarque qu'à certains moments, les communautés fortement liées économiquement et socialement à l'armée (notamment sur la ripa Pannonica), étaient celles qui avaient le plus grand pouvoir d'achat et présentaient la plus forte demande. Un lien étroit peut également être établi avec la position des centres urbains sur les principaux axes de diffusion des sigillées en Pannonie. La question est ensuite abordée d'un point de vue chronologique afin de retracer l'historique de la commercialisation de la sigillée en provenance des différents groupes d'ateliers occidentaux. Quelques grands ateliers sont privilégiés pour le commerce en Pannonie (La Graufesenque particulièrement sous les règnes de Domitien et Trajan, Lezoux entre 140 et 170, Rheinzabern entre 180 et 250). Ils ont dominé successivement le marché pannonien, même si d'autres ateliers comme Banassac, les Martres-de-Veyre, Heiligenberg, Westerndorf et Pfaffenhofen ont également joué un rôle dans les importations. Les changements survenus dans l'organisation de l'approvisionnement des marchés pannoniens sont bien sûr liés au dynamisme des ateliers, mais ils ont également été fortement influencés par la conjoncture à la fois économique, sociale et historique en Pannonie. Les événements militaires ont joué un rôle majeur : les guerres contre les Daces, qui ont suivi la sécurisation du commerce fluvial, la construction d'une ligne de fortifications sur la ripa, ont entraîné une concentration de l'armée sur le Danube et créé un contexte favorable pour le développement des importations depuis la Gaule du Sud par la voie danubienne. À l'inverse, les perturbations causées par les guerres des Marcomans et des Sarmates ont largement contribué à la sortie des productions lezoviennes des marchés pannoniens. Dans d'autres cas, c'est la politique impériale qui a renforcé les communautés consommatrices, par exemple par les campagnes d'urbanisation sous le règne d'Hadrien (époque de développement des importations de Lezoux) et à l'époque sévérienne, ainsi que par toutes les faveurs et l'argent que les empereurs ont dépensé sur l'armée dans cette région qui avait une position stratégique (ce qui a eu pour effet la domination des sigillées de Rheinzabern dans les sites pannoniens). À certaines phases de prospérité particulière, la demande était si importante qu'elle ne pouvait être entièrement satisfaite par les seules productions venues des ateliers dominant le marché; cela a créé une ouverture pour l'arrivée des productions d'autres ateliers qui ont ainsi profité de ces circonstances favorables. C'est par exemple le cas des ateliers de Gaule de l'Est entre 135 et 160 / 165. Westerndorf et Pfaffenhofen ont également profité du second âge d'or de l'époque sévérienne et Pfaffenhofen était avantagée par sa position dans la même zone de taxation. Toutes ces évolutions ont à leur tour influencé la structure des réseaux de diffusion de la sigillée par le développement de certains axes comme la route de l'ambre, la voie diagonale Aquincum-Poetovio et l'axe danubien. En parallèle, cela a influencé le dynamisme des centres de consommation situés sur ces axes : le développement de la voie danubienne a réduit l'importance de Neviodunum et Siscia situés sur les anciennes routes commerciales depuis l'Italie, tandis qu'il a favorisé le rôle d'Aquincum ou Carnuntum comme ports de commerce. Les évolutions de l'intensité de la consommation de sigillée dans les centres urbains sont particulièrement visibles dans les proportions des estampilles provenant des différents groupes d'ateliers : la composition du mobilier varie fortement entre les sites du sud et de l'ouest de la province et ceux situés le long de la ripa. Cette étude peut être complétée par une analyse des autres aspects de l'importation des sigillées en Pannonie, par exemple du point de vue de la consommation, les choix des types de vases (formes, taille, utilisation) dans les habitats et dans les nécropoles, ou bien du point de vue des fabricants, les relations commerciales des officina et des potiers...|$|E
