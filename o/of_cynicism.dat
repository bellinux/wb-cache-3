25|$|Along with Antisthenes and Crates of Thebes, Diogenes is {{considered}} one of the founders <b>of</b> <b>Cynicism.</b> The ideas of Diogenes, like those of most other Cynics, must be arrived at indirectly. No writings of Diogenes survive even though he is reported to have authored over ten books, a volume of letters and seven tragedies. Cynic ideas are inseparable from Cynic practice; therefore what we know about Diogenes is contained in anecdotes concerning his life and sayings attributed to him in a number of scattered classical sources.|$|E

Thus, the aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the mediating role of perceived internal status on the effects of leader-member exchange on organizational <b>cynicism.</b> Findings <b>of</b> the study demonstrate that LMX negatively effects all sub dimensions <b>of</b> organizational <b>cynicism.</b> Specifically, it is found that perceived internal status partially mediates the relationship between LMX and both cognitive (beliefs) and affective (feelings) sub dimensions <b>of</b> organizational <b>cynicism</b> and fully mediates the relationship between LMX and behavioral (behaviors) sub dimension <b>of</b> organizational <b>cynicism...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} the levels <b>of</b> organizational <b>cynicism</b> and commitment <b>of</b> the primary and secondary school teachers, the relationship between both variables and the effect <b>of</b> organizational <b>cynicism</b> on organizational commitment. Two-scale questionnaires were used and applied to a population of 316 teachers who work in Akhisar in Manisa. According to research results: organizational cynicism’s cognitive and behavioural dimensions are medium whereas it is lower in affective dimension. Organizational commitment is medium throughout all scale and on identification and internalisation dimensions whereas it is low on adaptation dimension. In addition, there was medium-leveled negative relationship between organizational commitment and cynicism. It is also observed that cognitive and affective dimensions <b>of</b> organizational <b>cynicism</b> predict all dimensions of the organizational commitment...|$|R
25|$|After being {{captured}} by pirates and sold into slavery, Diogenes eventually settled in Corinth.

None of Diogenes' many writings have survived, but details of his life {{come in the form of}} anecdotes (chreia), especially from Diogenes Laërtius, in his book Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers. All that is available are a number of anecdotes concerning his life and sayings attributed to him in a number of scattered classical sources.|$|E
500|$|The ancient Cynics {{rejected}} conventional social values, {{and would}} criticise {{the types of}} behaviours, such as greed, which they viewed as causing suffering.

40|$|In this study, it {{is aimed}} to {{determine}} the reasons <b>of</b> organizational <b>cynicism</b> <b>of</b> {{the teachers in the}} secondary education and to reveal the effects <b>of</b> organizational <b>cynicism.</b> This study is important in terms of revealing the reasons and the effects <b>of</b> organizational <b>cynicism</b> which causes lots of negative attitudes and behaviours in organizations and in terms of providing suggestions to lessen its presence. It is a case study which belongs to qualitative design classification. The research sample consists of 21 teachers who have more than 10 years of teaching experience and are working in the secondary schools located in the center of Gaziantep province in 2012 - 2013 academic year. Data are gathered through interview method. Data are analyzed through descriptive and content analysis methods. In the data analysis process, a qualitative data analyze programme (ATLAS. ti 6) was utilized. Research results suggest that the reasons <b>of</b> organizational <b>cynicism</b> are originating from school administration (being unfair, not appreciating the teachers, not rewarding the teachers) and from teachers (not being pleased with the salary, the syndrome of being burnout, not having a suitable personality). In conclusion, it is revealed that education and instruction, cooperation in the school, the profession of teaching, commitment to school, motivation, professional burnout and performance are badly affected by organizational cynicism. Suggestions for practitioners and researchers are presented according to the findings of the study and the participants’ proposals in order to decrease organizational cynicis...|$|R

The sample of this study, designed as a survey research, consists of 436 teachers employed in schools in the city center of the province of Denizli, Turkey. The data of the study were collected through the administration of Teachers’ Occupational Professionalism Scale and Organizational Cynicism Scale to the sample group. In data analysis, descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA and regression analyses were conducted. The results of the study indicate that occupational professionalism of teachers was high and their organizational cynicism was close to medium level. Low and negative relations were found between occupational professionalism of teachers and their cognitive and affective cynicism levels. According to regression analysis, only contribution to organization as one of the four sub-dimensions of occupational professionalism was a significant predictor of cognitive and affective <b>cynicism</b> <b>of</b> teachers. Occupational professionalism of teachers was not observed to be significantly influential on the behavioral <b>cynicism</b> <b>of</b> teachers.

500|$|There {{is little}} record <b>of</b> <b>Cynicism</b> in the 2nd or 1st centuries BC; Cicero (c. 50 BC), who was much {{interested}} in Greek philosophy, had little to say about Cynicism, except that [...] "it is to be shunned; for it is opposed to modesty, without which there can be neither right nor honor." [...] However, by the 1st century AD, Cynicism reappeared with full force. The rise of Imperial Rome, like the Greek loss of independence under Philip and Alexander three centuries earlier, {{may have led to}} a sense of powerlessness and frustration among many people, which allowed a philosophy which emphasized self-sufficiency and inner-happiness to flourish once again. Cynics could be found throughout the empire, standing on street corners, preaching about virtue. Lucian complained that [...] "every city is filled with such upstarts, particularly with those who enter the names of Diogenes, Antisthenes, and Crates as their patrons and enlist in the Army of the Dog," [...] and Aelius Aristides observed that [...] "they frequent the doorways, talking more to the doorkeepers than to the masters, making up for their lowly condition by using impudence." [...] The most notable representative <b>of</b> <b>Cynicism</b> in the 1st century AD was Demetrius, whom Seneca praised as [...] "a man of consummate wisdom, though he himself denied it, constant to the principles which he professed, of an eloquence worthy to deal with the mightiest subjects." [...] Cynicism in Rome was both the butt of the satirist and the ideal of the thinker. In the 2nd century AD, Lucian, whilst pouring scorn on the Cynic philosopher Peregrinus Proteus, nevertheless praised his own Cynic teacher, Demonax, in a dialogue.|$|E

Christian writers would often praise Cynic poverty, although they scorned Cynic shamelessness: Augustine stating that they had, [...] "in violation of the modest instincts of men, boastfully proclaimed their unclean and shameless opinion, worthy indeed of dogs."
