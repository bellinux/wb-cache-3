5|$|Echmarcach mac Ragnaill (died 1064/1065) was a {{dominant}} {{figure in the}} eleventh-century Irish Sea region. At his height, he reigned as king over Dublin, the Isles, and perhaps the Rhinns of Galloway. The precise identity of Echmarcach's father, Ragnall, is uncertain. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this man {{was one of two}} eleventh-century rulers of Waterford. Another possibility is that Echmarcach's father was an early eleventh-century ruler of the Isles.

Another possibility is that its core has already completely solidified. The state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulfur, which is unknown at present.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could not be {{determined}} with certainty. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, {{and the opening of}} the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread. There is also a theory that the fire was set by burglars who tried to cover their tracks; however, {{there was no evidence of}} a burglary.|$|E
50|$|The inquiry did not {{determine}} a particular cause. The aircraft had flown {{into the ocean}} for no apparent reason, and so the board focussed on the altimeter. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the static pressure system or altimeter was malfunctioning and not allowing display of the correct altitude.|$|R
50|$|<b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the rocket}} {{had been a}} solitary missile with a radar-blocking {{electromagnetic}} pulse (EMP) payload launched from a Trident missile at sea in order to blind Russian radars {{in the first stage}} of a surprise attack. In this scenario, gamma rays from a high-altitude nuclear detonation would create a very high-intensity electromagnetic pulse that would confuse radars and incapacitate electronic equipment. After that, according to the scenario, the real attack would start.|$|R
50|$|The {{place of}} Luo's birth and date are a {{controversial}} question. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> from Taiyuan, {{and lived in}} the late Yuan Dynasty and early Ming Dynasty by the record of his contemporary, the playwright Jia Zhongming (賈仲明), {{who said that he}} had met him in 1364. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> born in Dongyuan, the province of Shangdong, in about 1280 - 1360. Literary historians suggest other possibilities for his home, also including Hangzhou and Jiangnan.|$|R
5|$|The prime {{motivation}} behind Magnús' {{cooperation with}} Ælfgar is uncertain. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he {{was attempting to}} establish Norwegian authority in the west {{as a means to}} prepare an invasion of England. In so doing, Magnús may have backed the cause of a local faction that opposed Echmarcach. Certainly, the thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann records that Ímar's apparent son, Gofraid Crobán (died 1095)a future ruler of Dublin and the Islesbacked the Norwegian invasion of England led by Magnús' father in 1066.|$|E
5|$|The unusually low {{metallicity}} of Vega {{makes it}} a weak Lambda Boötis-type star. However, {{the reason for the}} existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0-F0 stars remains unclear. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the chemical peculiarity {{may be the result of}} diffusion or mass loss, although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near the end of a star's hydrogen-burning lifespan. Another possibility is that the star formed from an interstellar medium of gas and dust that was unusually metal-poor.|$|E
5|$|Charles Messier {{measured}} {{the position of}} the cluster and included it as M45 in his catalogue of comet-like objects, published in 1771. Along with the Orion Nebula and the Praesepe cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets—something that seems scarcely possible for the Pleiades. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalogue than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.|$|E
5000|$|<b>One</b> final <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{this and}} other {{hospitals}} located on pilgrim routes or ancient drover’s roads were used by travellers {{might have had a}} similar religious function to bridge chapels where travellers [...] "rested" [...] and said prayers before continuing their journey.|$|R
25|$|<b>One</b> other <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the {{portrait}} shows Henry's Scottish niece, Lady Margaret Douglas, the mother-in-law of Mary, Queen of Scots. So, whilst debate continues about {{the identity of}} the Toledo portrait, the miniature shown above is very likely to be Henry's fifth queen.|$|R
30|$|<b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> can <b>be</b> <b>that</b> if the AV stative verb {{shifts to}} an NAV, it will complicate the {{argument}} structure. An NAV stative predicate implies <b>that</b> there will <b>be</b> an additional causer and causee. The sentence will be ungrammatical and unintelligible in this case. However, more investigation and tests {{are needed to}} explain this special restriction.|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that effects related to either electrostatic charging or discharging might be able to account for some of the transient lunar phenomena. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> electrodynamic effects related to the fracturing of near-surface materials could charge any gases that might be present, such as implanted solar wind or radiogenic daughter products. If this were to occur at the surface, the subsequent discharge from this gas might be able to give rise to phenomena visible from Earth. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the triboelectric charging of particles within a gas-borne dust cloud could give rise to electrostatic discharges visible from Earth. Finally, electrostatic levitation of dust near the terminator could potentially give rise to some form of phenomenon visible from Earth.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Dressel 20 amphora, the {{principal}} type found at Monte Testaccio, {{may have been}} unusually difficult to recycle. Many types of amphora could be re-used to carry {{the same type of}} product or modified to serve a different purpose—for instance, as drain pipes or flower pots. Fragmentary amphorae could be pounded into chips to use in opus signinum, a type of concrete widely used as a building material, or could simply be used as landfill. The Dressel 20 amphora, however, broke into large curved fragments that could not readily be reduced to small shards. It is likely that the difficulty of reusing or repurposing the Dressel 20s meant that it was more economical to discard them.|$|E
5|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. During the Soviet Venera program, the Venera 9 orbiter obtained spectroscopic evidence of lightning on Venus, and the Venera 12 descent probe obtained additional evidence of lightning and thunder. The European Space Agency's Venus Express in 2007 detected whistler waves further confirming {{the occurrence of}} lightning on Venus. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> ash from a volcanic eruption was generating the lightning. Another piece of evidence comes from measurements of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which dropped {{by a factor of}} 10 between 1978 and 1986, jumped in 2006, and again declined 10-fold. This may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions.|$|E
50|$|Alphonse's death without heirs {{raised some}} {{questions}} as to the succession to his lands. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they should revert to the crown, another <b>that</b> they should <b>be</b> redistributed to his family. The latter was claimed by Charles of Anjou, but in 1283 Parlement decided that the County of Toulouse should revert to the crown, {{if there were no}} male heirs. Alphonse's wife Joan (who died four days after Alphonse) had attempted to dispose of some of her inherited lands in her will. Joan was the only surviving child and heiress of Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse, Duke of Narbonne, and Marquis of Provence, so under Provençal and French law, the lands should have gone to her nearest male relative. But, her will was invalidated by Parlement in 1274. One specific bequest in Alphonse's will, giving his wife's lands in the Comtat Venaissin to the Holy See, was allowed, and it became a Papal territory, a status that it retained until 1791.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, most {{researchers}} agreed <b>that</b> P. becklesii <b>was</b> a member of the Titanosauriformes, possibly of the titanosauriform Titanosauria. In the latter case it would have been one of the oldest known European titanosaurs. The 2015 study performed some detailed cladistic analyses to establish the exact position of Haestasaurus in the evolutionary tree. Due to the limited material available however, it proved impossible to obtain a single solution to this problem. Two major alternatives presented themselves. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Haestasaurus <b>was</b> indeed a, basal, member of the Titanosauria. Alternatively, Haestasaurus was a basal member of the larger clade of the Macronaria, a close relative of Camarasaurus, Janenschia or Tehuelchesaurus. The authors favoured the last possibility because the traits pointing to a membership of the Titanosauria, such as a robust humerus and a robust ulna, could easily have been developed in a process of convergent evolution, as adaptations for weight-bearing. Haestasaurus would then represent a rare late-surviving basal macronarian.|$|R
50|$|The direct {{reason for}} an {{abnormally}} nose-up position {{was found to}} be an excessively high stabilizer trim setting (7.5 units ANU); likely, in the confusion due to switching seats, the pilots failed to reset the trim setting while performing takeoff checklists. (It was reported the first officer made this mistake occasionally.) Taking off at night, with no visual references, the inexperienced flight engineer did not manage to correct the attitude in time, leading to engine surges, aircraft banking and eventually an upset and an unrecoverable stall. It was not known why the captain did not manage to correct the situation; <b>one</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the flight engineer froze on the controls as he put the DC-8 into a gradual bank, and the opposite inputs from the captain had no effect on the movement of the stabilizer. The captain's decision to allow the flight engineer perform the takeoff was considered a contributing factor in the accident.|$|R
5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> although these animals indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E
5|$|Echmarcach {{was the son}} of a {{man named}} Ragnall. Whilst Echmarcach bore a Gaelic name, the name of his father is {{ultimately}} derived from Old Norse, a fact that serves to exemplify the hybrid nature of the eleventh-century Irish Sea region, The identity of Echmarcach's father is uncertain. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Ragnall was a member of the dynasty that ruled the Norse-Gaelic enclave of Waterford in tenth- and eleventh centuries. If so, Echmarcach may have been the son of one of two Waterfordian rulers: Ragnall mac Ímair, King of Waterford (died 1018), or this man's apparent son, Ragnall ua Ímair, King of Waterford (died 1035). Another possibility is that Echmarcach belonged to a family from the Isles, and that his father was Ragnall mac Gofraid, King of the Isles (died 1004/1005), son and possible successor of Gofraid mac Arailt, King of the Isles (died 989). As a descendant of either of the aforesaid families, Echmarcach would appear to have been a member of the Uí Ímair, a royal dynasty descended from the Scandinavian sea-king Ímar (died c.873).|$|E
5|$|How the ostensibly weak-swimming {{frilled shark}} captures active, {{fast-moving}} squid {{is a matter}} of speculation. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it takes advantage of injured squid, or those that are exhausted and dying after spawning. Alternatively, it may surprise its prey by curving its body and, bracing itself with its posteriorly positioned fins, launching a quick strike forward {{in the manner of a}} snake. It may also be able to close its gill slits and create negative pressure to suck prey into its mouth. The many small, sharp, recurved teeth of the frilled shark are functionally similar to squid jigs and could easily snag the body or tentacles of a squid, particularly as they are rotated outwards when the jaws are protruded. Observations of captive frilled sharks swimming with their mouths open suggest that the small teeth, light against the dark mouth, may even fool squid into attacking and entangling themselves.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>One</b> {{interesting}} <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the galactic}} center (GC) source HESS J 1745 - 290 is associ-ated with {{the galactic center}} source Sgr A*, the galactic center black hole, in which case we may expect variability as seen in IR and X-rays, with QPO frequencies predicted by Aschenbach et al. (2006). We will present {{the results of a}} search for such variable signatures using HESS observations of this source...|$|R
5000|$|The {{definition}} for Hamiltonian matrices {{can be extended}} to complex matrices in two ways. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> to say <b>that</b> a matrix [...] is Hamiltonian if , as above.

30|$|It <b>is</b> true <b>that</b> {{the width}} of the {{south-east}} dipping “cloud” of relocated hypocenters looks wider than the errors of the hypocenter determinations estimated in “Hypocenter relocation of the cluster activity”. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the errors <b>were</b> underestimated. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the earthquakes took place on a couple of parallel planes (e.g., Naoi et al. 2015). Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to investigate which would be the most plausible explanation from our results.|$|R
5|$|If Lǫgmaðr {{was indeed}} a crusader, it is {{uncertain}} which particular crusade he undertook. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he {{took part in the}} First Crusade, a movement that reached its climax with the successful siege and capture of Jerusalem in mid 1099. Lǫgmaðr could have embarked upon this enterprise in about 1096, the year the pope's calls reached England, and perhaps joined Robert's assembling forces that summer. Alternately, in light of Lǫgmaðr's capture by the Norwegians in 1098, it is conceivable that his release from custody was made conditional upon his exile and participation in the First Crusade. On the other hand, it is not impossible that Lǫgmaðr originally undertook a pilgrimage before catching wind of the crusade en route. Whatever the case, if Lǫgmaðr indeed participated and perished in the First Crusade, he may have met his end on campaign in Syria or Anatolia.|$|E
5|$|In Paynes Prairie, {{there was}} no {{significant}} difference in rate of infection between males and females, but only 4% of juveniles were infected, compared to 52% of adults. Most species of Capillaria occur in multiple hosts, but A.forresteri has been found only in the marsh rice rat, even though several other small mammals (the round-tailed muskrat, Neofiber alleni; cotton mouse, Peromyscus gossypinus; hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus; and marsh rabbit, Sylvilagus palustris) occur in Paynes Prairie. The rice rat eats more animal food than any of those, and perhaps A.forresteri has an intermediate host that is not eaten by the other species. A.forresteri is markedly more prevalent in the wet season (spring) than the dry season (autumn), perhaps because rainfall patterns influence the habits of the rice rat in some way. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the intermediate host is an earthworm or other oligochaete worm that moves to the surface when it rains.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} that the battle took place before Somairle and Guðrøðr struggled for the kingship. Guðrøðr is otherwise known to have married a granddaughter of Muirchertach, and seems to have had an earlier marriage to another member of the Uí Néill. These marital unions could be evidence of an alliance between Guðrøðr and Muirchertach in the 1150s. Mac Scelling's participation in Muirchertach's service, therefore, could have been undertaken during a period of cooperation between the Isles and the Uí Néill. Nevertheless, an alliance between Somairle and Muirchertach may be perceptible as late as 1164, when the former lost his life leading an invasion of mainland Scotland. According to the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, Somairle commanded troops from Dublin, a settlement which have recognised Muirchertach's overlordship at the time. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a pact between the two concerned Somairle's support of Muirchertach regarding the Irish high-kingship, and Muirchertach's support of Somairle via Dublin.|$|E
40|$|An {{entertaining}} {{debate in}} cancer genetics concerns {{the relative importance}} of selection for a growth advantage and genomic instability in tumorigenesis.

50|$|<b>One</b> last <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a {{procedure}} may <b>be</b> declared INLINE, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> when the compiler sees {{a reference to}} it the code for the procedure is generated inline to save the overhead of {{a procedure}} call; this is best done for small pieces of code. Inline functions are similar to parameterized macros such as C #defines, except you don't get the problems with parameters that you can with macros. This facility is available in NEWP.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of formulaic language on L 2 learners’ ability to decode words in listening texts. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> formulas would facilitate listening by reducing the need to process every word of the sequences. However, a contrasting <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the commonly reduced nature of formulaic words would hinder performance. Words from targeted sections of two texts of different levels of difficulty were identified as formulaic or non-formulaic. To gather the data, participants transcribed these targeted sections in the texts through a technique known as paused transcription. Analysis of these transcriptions suggested the presence of formulas did not advantage the listeners in identifying words in general. However, it did advantage them in identifying function words, but only on the more challenging text. It <b>was</b> concluded <b>that</b> in this cognitively demanding environment of the challenging text, where listeners’ attention likely shifted to the content words to extract meaning, their holistic processing of the formulas facilitated their decoding of the function words by helping them to bypass analyzing many of these words individually. Besides these outcomes, the study was innovative both in the questions it sought to address and the methods used to address these...|$|R
5|$|There is {{uncertainty}} {{concerning the}} political situation in the Isles {{in the last decade}} of the eleventh century. What is known for sure is that, before the end of the century, Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway (died 1103) led a marauding fleet from Scandinavia into the Isles, seized control of the kingdom, and held onto power in the Irish Sea region until his death in 1103. According to the Chronicle of Mann, when Guðrøðr died in 1095, Lǫgmaðr succeeded him as his eldest son, and went on to reign for seven years. The numerical calculations and chronology of this source are suspect, and it is uncertain if Lǫgmaðr's reign began before Magnús' arrival, during Magnús' overlordship, or even after Magnús' death. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Lǫgmaðr commenced his reign in the Isles immediately after his father assumed the kingship of Dublin in 1091. If so, this transfer of power would seem to evidence the eminent status of Dublin's kinship amongst the Norse-Gaelic elite.|$|E
5|$|Óláfr's {{time in the}} Isles is {{confirmed}} by several Icelandic sources which recount how, in 1202, Guðmundr Arason attempted to sail from Iceland to Norway to become consecrated as the Bishop of Hólar. These saga accounts relate how the Icelanders encountered a severe storm and were blown far off course before being forced to make landfall in the Hebrides. The island they landed upon was almost certainly Sanday, a tiny tidal island linked to its larger neighbour Canna, the westernmost of the Small Isles. According to the saga the Icelanders were pressured numerous times to pay a landing-tax to a king named Óláfr. The king encountered by the Icelanders is considered to have been Óláfr, although {{at this point in}} history the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles is not known to have encompassed the Small Isles. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Óláfr, like the Icelanders, may have been temporarily stranded on the tidal island, and that he may have taken advantage of the storm-stricken churchmen to offset the poverty that is assigned to him by the chronicle.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Knútr took other actions to contain Orkney. Evidence that Knútr installed Hákon as overlord of the Isles may be preserved by the twelfth-century Ágrip af Nóregskonungasǫgum. The historicity of this event is uncertain, however, and Hákon's authority in the Isles is not attested by any other source. Be that as it may, this twelfth-century text states that Hákon had been sent into the Isles by Óláfr, and that Hákon ruled the region {{for the rest of}} his life. The chronology outlined by this source suggests that Hákon left Norway at about the time Óláfr assumed the kingship in 1016. The former is certainly known to have been in Knútr's service soon afterwards in England. <b>One</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Knútr installed Hákon as overlord of Orkney and the Isles in about 1016/1017, before handing him possession of the Earldom of Worcester in about 1017. If this was the case, Hákon would have been responsible for not only a strategic part of the Anglo-Welsh frontier, but also accountable for the far-reaching sea-lanes that stretched from the Irish Sea region to Norway. It seems likely that Knútr was more concerned about Orkney and the Isles, and the security of the sea-lanes around Scotland, than surviving sources let on. Hákon's death at sea would have certainly been a cause of concern for Knútr's regime, and could have been directly responsible to the meeting between him and the three kings. If Hákon had indeed possessed overlordship of the Isles, his demise could well have paved the way for Echmarcach's own rise to power. Having come to terms with the three kings, it {{is possible}} that Knútr relied upon Echmarcach to counter the ambitions of the Orcadians, who could have attempted to seize upon Hákon's fall and renew their influence in the Isles.|$|E
30|$|An {{earthquake}} on January 30, 2011 {{that occurred}} {{a year before}} the 2012 cluster activity also had a small stress drop. Though the reason <b>is</b> unclear, <b>one</b> <b>possibility</b> would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the estimated stress drop of the earthquake was the least robust among the analyzed earthquakes because the earthquake had the largest standard deviation of estimated stress drop, which was calculated from individual corner frequencies of waveforms observed by the individual components of stations.|$|R

50|$|<b>One</b> {{suggested}} <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> anomalocaridids fed by grabbing one end {{of their}} prey in their jaws while using their appendages to quickly rock {{the other end of}} the animal back and forth. This produced stresses that exploited the weaknesses of arthropod cuticles, causing the prey's exoskeleton to rupture and allowing the predator to access its innards. This behaviour was originally thought to have provided an evolutionary pressure for trilobites to roll up, to avoid being flexed until they snapped.|$|R
