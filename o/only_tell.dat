5|$|The {{reasons for}} the runestone {{tradition}} are {{a matter of debate}} but they include inheritance issues, status and the honouring of the deceased. Several runestones explicitly commemorate inheritance such as the Ulunda stone and the Hansta stone, {{but the vast majority of}} the runestones <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> who raised the stone and in memory of whom.|$|E
5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 55,722, Ajax {{took the lead in}} the third minute when Cees de Wolf scored. They {{extended}} their lead in the 17th minute courtesy of a Johan Cruyff goal. Two more goals scored by forward Klaas Nuninga meant Ajax had a 4–0 lead at half-time. Liverpool responded late in the game when defender Chris Lawler scored in the 89th minute; however, Ajax scored a minute later through Henk Groot to win the match 5–1. The spectators could not really see much of the match due to the fog's density and at times could <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> by the celebration of the team when a goal was scored.|$|E
5|$|What then is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; I can <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> you my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too {{sure that it is}} right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|E

25|$|There are {{in total}} about 30 runestones that tell {{of people who}} went to England, see the England Runestones. Some {{of them are very}} laconic and <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> that the Viking was buried in London, or in Bath, Somerset.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} methods to {{determine}} whether a given number n is prime. The most basic routine, trial division, is of little practical use because of its slowness. One group of modern primality tests is applicable to arbitrary numbers, while more efficient tests are available for particular numbers. Most such methods <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> whether n is prime or not. Routines also yielding one (or all) prime factors of n are called factorization algorithms.|$|E

25|$|In {{retirement}} Eden {{corresponded with}} Selwyn Lloyd, coordinating {{the release of}} information and with which writers they would agree to speak and when. Rumours that Britain had colluded with France and Israel appeared, albeit in garbled form, as early as 1957. By the 1970s they had agreed that Lloyd would <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> {{his version of the}} story after Eden’s death (in the event, Lloyd would outlive Eden by a year, struggling with terminal illness to complete his own memoirs).|$|E
25|$|The Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre {{is located}} to the North of Montrose, Angus, Scotland. Montrose has the {{distinction}} of having the first operational military airfield in Great Britain and the Heritage Centre {{is located on the}} former airfield. It aims to show the human side of its history with a collection of contemporary photographs, artefacts and memorabilia. These not <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> {{of the history of the}} airfield but also the story of the men and women who served there and those who lived in the area.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} a 2000s {{consumer}} 3D pointing device is the Wii Remote. While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and direction of movement), Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the lights from the IR emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the nunchuk accessory lacks a camera, it can <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> its current heading and orientation). The obvious drawback to {{this approach is that}} it can only produce spatial coordinates while its camera can see the sensor bar. More accurate consumer devices have since been released, including the PlayStation Move, the Razer Hydra and the controllers part of the HTC Vive virtual reality system. All of these devices can accurately detect position and orientation in 3D space regardless of angle relative to the sensor station.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fourth}} season Brian Benben and Caterina Scorsone were {{upgraded}} to series regulars. The season {{begins with the}} aftermath of Dell's death, including his funeral {{and what happens to}} his daughter Betsey. Violet and Pete get married in the season premiere and finally begin a new life with their son Lucas. Addison and Sam reveal their romance to the staff of Oceanside Wellness, which causes Naomi to leave town to learn to accept their new relationship. Cooper and Charlotte's relationship continues to get stronger as they get engaged. Charlotte is raped and badly beaten by one of the patients at her hospital and decides to <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> Addison and make her keep it a secret. Charlotte later decides she does not want to tell anyone she was raped, not even Cooper. Later everyone finds out but Charlotte won't identify Lee McHenry, her rapist. Later we find out Violet was raped while she was in college. Charlotte finally decides to identify Lee because Sheldon tells her to do so. She goes to the police station, but since she did not accuse him and because of the long history of Charlotte not telling, the lawyer does not accept to charge Lee, who is later stabbed by his girl friend in self-defense. She tells the authorities about almost getting killed, which finally leads to Lee's arrest, but before this, he is saved at the surgeon's slab with Charlotte granting the procedure in spite of her being victimized by him. In the season finale it was decided that they will close down Oceanside Wellness and open another practice; and Naomi decides {{it would be best to}} move to New York to be with Gabriel.|$|E
500|$|In October 1957 Palewski was {{appointed}} as France's ambassador to Italy. Mitford's meetings with him, {{which had become}} increasingly rare because of [...] his many political and social commitments, were now reduced to a single visit a year, supplemented with occasional letters. [...] Mitford mainly concealed her true feelings on this separation, although one acquaintance noted her increasingly [...] "savage" [...] teasing of friends, which was perhaps a safety valve: [...] "If she would <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> one she is unhappy one would do what one could to comfort her". In March 1958 Mitford's father, Lord Redesdale, died. After the cremation, she informed her sister Jessica, [...] "the ashes were done up {{in the sort of}} parcel he used to bring back from London, rich thick brown paper & incredibly neat knots".|$|E
500|$|The refrain {{is based}} on a Gm–E(add2)–B–F/A chord progression. Fraser McAlphine of the BBC wrote that Rihanna feels {{confined}} [...] "in a cell of [...] own creation". She sings without vibrato, a pulsating musical effect used to add expression. One commentator, The New York Times David Brownie, wrote that despite this, her voice subtly shows grief and regret. Eminem then [...] "zap out into a ballady rap": [...] "I can't tell you what it really is/ I can <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> you what it feels like." [...] The verses follow a Gm–E(add2)B–Fsus/A chord progression. Eminem regrets an end to an abusive, failed relationship, describing mutual violence and expressing both fondness and anger. The two artists' characters are portrayed in a romantic relationship when he responds to Rihanna by concluding the verse: [...] "I laid hands on her. I'll never stoop so low again/ I guess I don't know my own strength." [...] Rihanna sings the chorus again, backed by an electric guitar and a piano.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft {{and other}} {{political}} radicals during {{the last quarter of}} the 18th century focused their reform efforts on education because they believed that if people were educated correctly, Britain would experience a moral and political revolution. Religious Dissenters, especially, embraced this view; Wollstonecraft's philosophy in Thoughts and elsewhere closely resembles that of the Dissenters she met while teaching in Newington Green, such as the theologian, educator, and scientist Joseph Priestley and the minister Richard Price. Dissenters [...] "were most concerned with molding children into people of good moral character and habits". However, political conservatives, who also believed that childhood was the crucial time for the formation of a person's character, used their own educational works to deflect rebellion by promoting theories of compliance. Liberals and conservatives alike subscribed to Lockean and Hartleian associationist psychology: that is, they believed that a person's sense of self was built up through a set of associations made between things in the external world and ideas in the mind. Both Locke and Hartley had argued that the associations formed in childhood were nearly irreversible and must thus be formed with care. Locke famously advised parents to keep their children away from servants, as they would <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> children frightening stories that would foster a fear of the dark.|$|E
500|$|Landing near Constantinople, Calafia {{meets with}} other Moslem warrior leaders who {{were unable to}} remove King Amadis and his Christian allies from the city, and she tells them all to hold back and watch her manner of combat—she says they will be amazed. The next morning, she and her women warriors mount their [...] "fierce beasts" [...] wearing gold armor [...] "adorned with the most {{precious}} stones", advancing to invest the city. Calafia orders the griffins forward and they, hungry from the long sea voyage, fly out and maul the city's defenders. Sating their hunger, the griffins continue to snatch Christian men in their claws and carry them high in air only to drop them to their deaths. The city's defenders cower and hide from the griffins. Seeing this, Calafia passes word to her Moslem allies that {{they are free to}} advance and take the city. The griffins, however, cannot tell Moslem from Christian; they can <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> man from woman. The griffins begin snatching Moslem soldiers and carrying them aloft, dropping and killing them. Calafia questions her pagan faith, saying, [...] "O ye idols in whom I believe and worship, what is this which has happened as favorably to my enemies as to my friends?" [...] She orders her woman warriors to take the city's battlements and they fight well, taking many injuries from arrows and quarrels piercing the soft gold metal of their armor. Calafia orders her allies forward to assist the Californians in battle, but the griffins pounce again, killing Moslem men. She directs the griffin trainers to call them off, and the griffins return to roost in the ships.|$|E

Singh {{brought her to the}} Modern Industrial Area police station. The local police, realizing that she was a {{probable}} victim of the [...] "baby killer", informed Manjari. Somani told her that she had been kidnapped by a dark-skinned bicyclist with a thin beard, and led police to the house across the train tracks where she was kept overnight. Satish's brother told police that he was at work at a tin factory, where he was arrested.|$|E
2500|$|The group later cited an Associated Press story {{stating that}} [...] "This year’s U.S. troop buildup {{has succeeded in}} {{bringing}} violence in Baghdad down from peak levels, but {{the death toll from}} sectarian attacks around the country is running nearly double the pace from a year ago." [...] The story also stated that [...] "The U.S. military did not get all the additional American forces into Iraq until June 15, so it would be premature to draw a final statistical picture of the effect of the added troops." [...] The group also cited an NPR article quoting former Army Colonel [...] calling Petraeus' statistics [...] "an illusion created by the White House". The article concluded by stating that [...] "So is the surge working? The short answer is that no one can know for certain because statistics <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> {{a small part of the}} story." ...|$|E
