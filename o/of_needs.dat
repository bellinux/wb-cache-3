The common denominator for any principle <b>of</b> <b>need</b> {{is that it will}} ascribe some kind of special normative weight to people being worse off. However, this common ground does not answer the question how a plausible principle <b>of</b> <b>need</b> should relate to the aggregation of benefits across individuals. Principles <b>of</b> <b>need</b> are sometimes stated as being incompatible with aggregation and sometimes characterized as accepting aggregation {{in much the same way}} as utilitarians do. In this paper we argue that if one wants to take principles <b>of</b> <b>need</b> seriously both <b>of</b> these positions have unreasonable implications.

40|$|Objective. To develop {{methods to}} produce small-area {{estimates}} <b>of</b> <b>need</b> for hip and knee replacement surgery to inform local health service planning. Methods. Multilevel Poisson regression modeling {{was used to}} estimate rates <b>of</b> <b>need</b> for hip/knee replacement by age, sex, deprivation, rurality, and ethnic mix using a nationally representative population-based survey (the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, n 11, 392 people age> 50 years). Estimates <b>of</b> <b>need</b> from the regression model were then combined with stratified census population counts to produce small-area predictions <b>of</b> <b>need.</b> Uncertainty in the predictions was obtained by taking a Bayesian simulation-based approach using WinBUGS software. This allows correlations in param-eter estimates to be appropriately incorporated in the credible intervals for the small-area predictions. Results. Small-area estimates <b>of</b> <b>need</b> for hip/knee replacement have been produced for wards and districts in England. Rates <b>of</b> <b>need</b> are adjusted for the sociodemographic characteristics of an area and include 95 % credible intervals. Need for hip/knee replacement varies geographically, dependant on the sociodemographic characteristics of an area. Conclusion. For the first time, small-area estimates <b>of</b> <b>need</b> for hip/knee replacement surgery have been produced together with estimates of uncertainty to inform local health planning. The methodologic approach described here could be reproduced in other countries and for other disease indicators. Further research is required to combine small-area estimates <b>of</b> <b>need</b> with provision {{to determine whether there}} is equitable access to care...|$|R

25|$|Maslow's {{hierarchy}} <b>of</b> <b>needs</b> is {{a pyramid}} depicting {{the levels of}} human needs, psychological, and physical. When a human being ascends {{the steps of the}} pyramid, he reaches self-actualization. Beyond the routine <b>of</b> <b>needs</b> fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as peak experiences, profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient, and yet a part of the world. This is similar to the flow concept of Mihály Csíkszentmihályi.|$|E

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>need</b> {{is often}} {{proposed}} as providing an additional or alternative criterion to cost-effectiveness in making allocation decisions in health care. If {{it is to}} be of practical value it must be sufficiently precisely characterized to be useful to decision makers. This will require both an account of how degree <b>of</b> <b>need</b> for an intervention is to be determined and a prioritization rule that clarifies how degree <b>of</b> <b>need</b> and the cost of the intervention interact in determining the relative priority of the intervention. Three common features of health care interventions must be accommodated in a comprehensive theory of need: the probabilistic nature of prognosis (with and without the intervention); the time course of effects; {{and the fact that the}} most effective treatments often combine more than one intervention. These common features are problematic for the concept <b>of</b> <b>need.</b> We outline various approaches to prioritization on the basis <b>of</b> <b>need</b> and argue that some approaches are more promising than others...|$|R

25|$|Alderfer, {{expanding}} on Maslow's hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>needs,</b> {{created the}} ERG theory. This theory posits {{that there are}} three groups of core needs — existence, relatedness, and growth, hence the label: ERG theory. The existence group is concerned with providing our basic material existence requirements. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group <b>of</b> <b>needs</b> are those of relatedness- the desire we have for maintaining important personal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others {{if they are to be}} satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs as an intrinsic desire for personal development. Maslow's categories are broken down into many different parts and there are a lot <b>of</b> <b>needs.</b> The ERG categories are more broad and covers more than just certain areas. As a person grows, the existence, relatedness, and growth for all desires continue to grow. All these needs should be fulfilled to greater wholeness as a human being. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization.|$|E
