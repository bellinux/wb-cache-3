But their own lack <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> the record and their growing concern that they were irrelevant started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and their style.|$|E

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> {{religious}} <b>beliefs</b> is distilled {{from the}} perspective <b>of</b> one’s <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> God. With regard to this <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> God we propose to distinguish between two dimensions: The personal versus the a-personal characte r of God and his transcendent versus his immanent nature. This leaves us with a plurality <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> God. Does this plurality <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> exist <b>in</b> the minds {{of people in the}} Netherlands and in South Africa? Together with this we explore the relationship between church involvement and plural religious <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> both countries. We have found a sharp contrast between the Dutch and a sample of church-going white South Africans regarding secularization and church involvement. Nevertheless, we have found a highly similar structure <b>of</b> religious <b>beliefs</b> among both people...|$|R
25|$|Within the Free Grace movement, {{there has}} been {{disagreement}} over the essential content of saving faith.

25|$|The Nicene Creed, {{largely a}} {{response}} to Arianism, was formulated at the Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople in 325 and 381 respectively, and ratified as the universal creed of Christendom by the Council of Ephesus in 431.

25|$|In the Bayesian (or epistemological) interpretation, {{probability}} measures a “degree of belief.” Bayes’ theorem then {{links the}} degree <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> a proposition {{before and after}} accounting for evidence.

If the coin is flipped a number of times and the outcomes observed, that degree of belief may rise, fall or remain the same depending on the results.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> procedural fairness, humanitarian values, and attitudes toward asylum seekers amongst a sample of first year university students in Western Australia (N = 148). <b>Beliefs</b> <b>in</b> procedural fairness were measured <b>in</b> terms <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> the fairness <b>of</b> decision making and <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> the fairness <b>of</b> treatment. Findings supported the hypotheses, <b>in</b> that <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> procedural fairness {{were significantly related to}} attitudes and humanitarian values. Regression analyses revealed that <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> the fairness <b>of</b> treatment and humanitarian values made unique contributions in predicting attitudes.

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} supports the importance <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> predicting positive outcomes in life. We examined the performance implications <b>of</b> the <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> free will as an abstract, philosophical belief that views {{the self as}} free from internal and external constraints and capable of choosing and directing one's own path. In Study 1 (N = 116, undergraduates), <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> free will was associated with higher performance on an academic proofreading task. In Study 2 (N = 614, undergraduates), we examined performance in real academic settings, and the <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> free will measured {{at the beginning of}} the semester predicted better course and semester grades at the end of the semester. Importantly, we found support for the distinctive contribution <b>of</b> the <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> free will in comparison to well-established predictors of academic performance trait self-control and implicit theories. We conclude that individual differences in the endorsement <b>of</b> the <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> free will are a significant and unique predictor of academic achievement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|There is also {{discussion}} among philosophers about mental supervenience and {{our experience of}} duration. If all mental properties supervene only upon some physical properties at durationless moments, then {{it may be difficult}} to explain our experience of duration.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} different formal representations <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> epistemic game theory.

Special attention is also paid to the decision-theoretic principle known as the thesis of no subjective probability for self-action. Conditions in cope with this principle are given which underlie the interrelationships between different models <b>of</b> <b>beliefs,</b> and it is shown that under these conditions different doxastic structures can be coherently unified.

The study has been criticised by scholars such as Durlauf, Kortellos and Tan (2006). There is a tendency to build megachurches since 2000, that leads some churches to financial debt.|$|E

According to sociologists Ariela Keysar and Juhem Navarro-Rivera's review of numerous global studies on atheism, there are 450 to 500 million positive atheists and agnostics worldwide (7% of the world's population), with China having the most atheists in the world (200 million convinced atheists).|$|E
25|$|Literally {{translatable}} as ‘faint (yū - 幽) spirit (rei - 霊),’ yūrei is {{just one}} of several Japanese words used to refer to spirit beings.
