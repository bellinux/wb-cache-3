25|$|Around this time, {{faces and}} heels became a {{generally}} more obvious and {{important part of}} wrestling. 'Gimmicks' were more popular, and it widely became a popular sport again. Wrestling was generally seen more as a form <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> entertainment, however, than an official sport. It was more about building up face/heel feuds such as Roddy Piper/Hulk Hogan and going into a big blow off match, which people loved. The WWF broke its way into mainstream entertainment and regularly brought in celebrities such as Muhammad Ali.|$|E
25|$|Flipnote Studio 3D has {{received}} mostly positive feedback since its release in Japan. A Nintendo World Report editorial {{stated that the}} now-removed Flipnote Gallery: Friends feature was not very well put together. However, it also praised Flipnote Gallery: World and the wealth of other sharing options available. Despite the current lack of Spotpass features, the editorial expressed that Flipnote Studio 3D {{is still a lot}} <b>of</b> <b>fun,</b> <b>and</b> Nintendo should still release the then-delayed application in the West. The stripped-down non-Japanese version of Flipnote Studio 3D was received with mixed reactions.|$|E

25|$|Matters slowly improved, with Mysore soon {{distracted by}} {{a war with}} the Marathas of Gingee, and both the Setupathis of Ramnad and the Marathas of Tanjore {{occupied}} by wars within their own countries. Emperor Aurangzeb in 1686–1687 conquered the kingdoms of Madura's old enemies, Golconda and Bijapur, and he was for many years engaged in an exhausting war with the Marathas. Moreover, the young Nayak of Madurai, though imbued with a boyish love <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> adventure which endeared him to his countrymen, also had a stock of sound sense and ability which evoked the admiration of his ministers, and he took advantage of his improving prospects.|$|E
25|$|At {{the centre}} of all Nambassa festivals lay the village marketplaces. These {{consisted}} of dozens of hand craft outlets and health food eateries. Here the hustle and bustle, the exuberant colour and relaxed atmosphere, prevalent at the various Nambassa village marketplaces, was a feature. These centers of community are where one found the main information centre or where folks simply culminated just to absorb the diverse quirky celebratory ambiance. Over the various festivals the marketplaces evolved and became major attractions in themselves. Not only a space for the enjoyment of bartering for the various eclective products and oddities, but they were a place <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> entertainment, spontaneous or otherwise. The idea of a marketplace servicing the local population, {{as a method of}} doing business, buying, selling and exchanging products, is as old as civilization itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{series was}} set {{at a time of}} change in the fashion of the {{so-called}} traditional British holiday. During the years after the Second World War, British holiday camps flourished, as people were celebrating with fun and laughter again after years of austerity and wartime hardship. The series was set towards the end of this period, when the original format of holiday camps was coming to an end. Despite the feeling amongst many staff that their brand <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> entertainment for the whole family was a tradition that would endure, the emerging popularity at the time (late 1950s / early 1960s) for self-catering and holidaying abroad meant the camp was unlikely to survive in its original format. The closing storyline of the series was the camp undergoing drastic changes to modernise with the times, meaning that many of the staff would lose their jobs as their particular talents were no longer required.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{theatrical}} release <b>of</b> <b>Fun</b> <b>and</b> Fancy Free, Walt Disney Productions' bank debt declined from $4.2 million to $3 million. Around this time, Walt acknowledged {{the need for}} sound economic policies, but emphasized to the loaners that slashing production would be suicidal. In order to restore the studio to full financial health, he expressed his desire to return to producing full-length animated films. By then, three animated projects—Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, and Peter Pan—were in development. Walt felt the characters in Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan were too cold while Cinderella contained elements similar to Snow White and decided to greenlit the project. Selecting his top-tier animation talent, Ben Sharpsteen was assigned as supervising producer while Hamilton Luske, Wilfred Jackson, and Clyde Geronimi became the sequence directors. Nevertheless, production on Alice resumed so that both animation crews would effectively compete against each other to see which film would finish first.|$|E
