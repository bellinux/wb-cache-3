40|$|Abstract The ageing society poses {{significant}} {{challenges to}} Europe’s economy and society. In {{coming to grips}} with these issues, we must be aware of their ethical dimensions. Values are the heart of the European Union, as Article 1 a of the Lisbon Treaty makes clear: ‘‘The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity…’’. The notion of Europe as a community of values has various important implications, including the development of inclusion poli-cies. A special case of exclusion concerns the gap between those people with effective access to digital and informa-tion technology and those without access to it, the ‘‘digital divide’’, which in Europe is chiefly age-related. Policies to overcome the digital divide and, more generally speaking, e-inclusion policies addressing the ageing population raise some ethical problems. Among younger <b>senior</b> <b>citizens,</b> say those between 65 and 80 years old, the main issues are likely to be universal access to ICT and e-participation. Among the <b>older</b> <b>senior</b> <b>citizens,</b> say those more than 80 years old, the main issues are mental and physical deterioration and assistive technology. An approach geared towards the protection of human rights could match the different needs of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> and provide concrete guidance to evaluate information technologies for them...|$|R
40|$|The aged {{population}} is increasing in Malaysia. Malaysia was categorized as an ageing nation when the elderly population reached 7. 2 % (1. 8 million) by 2005. In {{a society where}} aging is progressing, and where even among elderly people there is an increasingly larger class of <b>older</b> <b>senior</b> <b>citizens,</b> {{the increasing number of}} elderly people requiring appropriate housing and personal care (board or personal care) will be an even greater issue of importance. To cope with the increase in elderly, Malaysia needs to have a careful housing and social policy plan to fulfill the housing needs, especially for the aging citizens. However, it seems as if there an ambiguous relationship between housing and social policy in Malaysia towards the elderly society. Hence, this paper seeks to discuss the provision of housing and social policy structure for the elderly to be housed in Malaysia. Past and current propositions on housing for the elderly will also be reviewed...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} {{connected with the}} placement of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> into homes for the elderly. The objectives of the thesis are {{to find out how}} long the waiting period for the placement into a home for <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> is and which obstacles and problems connected with the placement into homes for the elderly appear. The theoretical part of the thesis is focused on some demographic trends, the opinion of the Czech population about the <b>old</b> age and <b>senior</b> <b>citizens,</b> history of social services for <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> in the Czech Republic and abroad, and the current offer of social services for <b>senior</b> <b>citizens.</b> In this part, I also describe the process of placing of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> into homes for the elderly and the services which homes for the elderly offer to their clients; I also focus on the senior citizens´ financial reimbursement of board and lodging in homes for the elderly. The research was conducted by means of quantitative and qualitative methods and techniques. In the qualitative research, I deal with the second part of my goal identifying obstacles to placement in homes for the elderly. Firstly, I set the following research questions: 1) What are the obstacles and problems in the process of placing <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> into homes for the elderly? and 2) Do <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> have any other options of care instead of the care in homes for the elderly? Then, I conducted semi-standardized interviews with 3 social workers, 8 <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> and with 3 members of families which put their <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> into homes for the elderly. I asked all of them almost identical questions to be able to compare their responses later. The results show that nowadays, dependent <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> who have no other option of care {{are more likely to be}} placed into homes for the elderly. The answers to the question "What are the obstacles and problems when placing <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> into homes for the elderly?" were rather variable and they cannot be generalized. The quantitative part of my research relates to the first part of my goal. Here I primarily focused on the waiting period. The following two hypotheses were set for the research. H 1 : <b>Senior</b> <b>citizens</b> negatively evaluate the waiting period for their placement into homes for the elderly. H 2 : <b>Senior</b> <b>citizens</b> know only one possibility of care homes for the elderly. To verify the above hypotheses, I used the method of secondary analysis of the data taken from the client's documentation and the method of controlled conversation. Therefore, I conducted my research in the following homes for the elderly: Home for the elderly Light in Písek, Home for the elderly Bechyně, Home for the elderly Diaconia Centre ČCE Blanka in Písek, Home for the elderly Centre for Social Assistance Vodňany. Social workers in each facility advised me to use the greatest possible number of clients who were oriented and able to answer my questions. In total, I analyzed 100 files of personal documentation and then I conducted the structured interviews with the analysed clients in the homes for the elderly which are mentioned above. The average waiting period was 243 days. In the category of the waiting period shorter than 1 month there were 26 senior citizens; from 1 to 2 months 33 senior citizens; from 3 to 4 months 11 senior citizens; longer than 5 months 30 <b>senior</b> <b>citizens.</b> 79 <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> rated their waiting periods positively, but 21 <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> rated their waiting periods negatively. 56 <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> had some knowledge about other possibilities of care; most of them reported the nursing service (54 responses); homes with nursing (8 responses); personal assistance (3 responses); pensions for <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> (1 response) ...|$|R
40|$|New {{perspectives}} need to {{be gained}} on the roles of older adults and older workers in the new millenium. Because today's adult is healthier, policies concerning social security, retirement, and work {{need to be}} changed. There {{is a need for}} acceptance of various types of aging. Rather than mandating specific retirement, the individual should have more control over when he or she wants to retire. <b>Old</b> notions of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> and demeaning stereotypes of older adults must be eliminated. Social constructionists focus on understanding and explaining the individual process of aging as influenced by social definitions and structures. Understanding the social construction of age will enable those who work with older adults to include various expressions of aging. Adult, continuing, and community education must incorporate these new ideas and examine their own ideas about aging and the older worker.

In the present study, 451 volunteers enrolled in the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) completed surveys including questions regarding their volunteer experiences and how these experiences have affected their health and quality of life. The results suggest that volunteering through RSVP is associated with improvements in health and quality of life across a variety of dimensions.

40|$|A {{working paper}} on Citizen Education in Zimbabwe. Citizenship Education {{is a subject}} that bothers me and should do so to all conscientised Zimbabweans. For no nation that neglects Citizenship Education expects to endure long. In other more {{appropriate}} terms, no democracy such as ours, that disregards Citizenship Education can expect to remain free and democratic. The reasons for the necessity of Citizenship Education are numerous and obvious. The fact that Zimbabwe’s political Independence is just ten years old is common knowledge. For about a century the majority of this nation could not vote; the population was then fairly homogeneous and now, Zimbabwe has rapidly become multi-cultural and non-racial. More people are eligible to vote from the eighteen-year <b>olds</b> to the <b>senior</b> <b>citizens,</b> and yet fewer people than eligible dare vote during national and local elections.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the legibility of doctors’ handwriting in both private and public hospitals in Quezon City, Philippines. To comprise the prescription, error-prone drugs, abbreviations and symbols in prescriptions were collected based on related literature and were divided into prescription components (medicine name, numbers, abbreviations, and text). A randomly selected pool of licensed doctors from Quezon City hospitals were asked to write these and were classified either in the surgical, medical and intensive care category. Each prescription was assessed by a pharmacist, a young adult (20 - 34 years old), a middle-aged adult (35 - 49 years <b>old),</b> and a <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> (50 years <b>old</b> and up). The assessors’ misinterpretations of the prescriptions were tabulated. The factors significantly affecting the legibility of the handwriting of doctors were then subjected to an analysis of variance (ANOVA).

40|$|At present, {{the whole}} world has one {{characteristic}} feature in common, which is {{an increasing number of}} people reaching a high age. In this respect, the Czech Republic is no exception. As a result, the percentage of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> is also steadily increasing. Most of these <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> will be threatened by a low income, especially those who live alone. At present there is no statistics that would show the numbers of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> in specific age groups concerning the amount of pensions, and there is no statistics that would show the numbers in territorial units at lower levels than regions. It is surprising that, with the present alarming prognoses of the numbers of <b>senior</b> <b>citizens,</b> statistical data concerning pensions are not analysed in detail. Some of them rank in the group of poor and problematic <b>senior</b> <b>citizens,</b> as a result, for instance, of paying a low social insurance of failing to pay any social insurance at all.
