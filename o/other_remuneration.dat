40|$|As patent {{licensing}} {{has become the}} prime driver of technology trade, understanding the rationales behind a properly-deﬁned payment structure of the agreements is essential. Speciﬁcally, among the <b>other</b> <b>remuneration</b> components, upfront fees are critical in license negotiations since they imply a signiﬁcant initial investment y the licensee and represent a source of liquidity for the licensor. We investigate how contractual ﬂexibility, market uncertainty and technical uncertainty shape pfront fees from the licensee’s perspective. Upfront fees are shown to be positively associated with contractual ﬂexibility and market uncertainty, while technical ncertainty is positively associated with upfront fees only if the license warrants contractual ﬂexibility to the licensee. Licensees therefore do not necessarily see ncertainty as a negative attribute of a patent license, {{but rather as a}} potential value, above all if in presence of contractual ﬂexibility...|$|E
40|$|Agency logic {{assumes that}} {{executives}} are greedy and opportunistic, which implies that monetary incentives {{are necessary to}} ensure they act {{in the best interests}} of shareholders; whereas corporate logic assumes that executives are trustworthy professionals, which implies that they will act {{in the best interests of}} shareholders irrespective of the use of monetary incentives. Prior qualitative research on executive remuneration is reviewed in this paper in order to ascertain how these logics influence the decision making of remuneration committees. Given that agency logic and corporate logic are opposites, there is a tension between the remuneration principles of pay-for-performance and competitive pay. However, corporate logic trumps agency logic as remuneration committees prioritise competitive pay ahead of other principles, so that talented executives will be retained. The paper also discusses a range of <b>other</b> <b>remuneration</b> principles and practices as well as the remuneration processes that have diffused both logics amongst remuneration committees...|$|E
40|$|Using {{detailed}} {{administrative data}} linking French firms and workers {{over the years}} 2002 - 2007, we document a distinct U-shaped pattern in worker-level wages surrounding the time their employer is acquired by a foreign firm, with a dip in earnings observed for several years before domestic firms switch to MNE status. This pre-acquisition decline in earnings can partly explain why prior evidence found no impact of foreign ownership on worker-level wages. Accounting for the pre-acquisition earnings dip and other confounding wage dynamics we find that MNEs increase remuneration to workers by 4. 8 % initially, and by 6 %- 8 % after several years. Unique information about in-kind payments reveals that bonuses and <b>other</b> non-monetary <b>remuneration</b> also exhibit a U-shaped pattern surrounding foreign acquisition...|$|R
40|$|Forced truancy is a {{risk factor}} that {{influences}} juvenile behavior, requiring the joint efforts of school authorities, parents, and courts to address. It is a phenomenon where students desire attending school, but for reasons beyond their control, they are prohibited from attending classes. Some of these reasons are teachers 2 ̆ 7 strike action, students 2 ̆ 7 poverty, lack of educational infrastructures, and unsafe educational environment. Teachers 2 ̆ 7 strike is a frequent occurrence in southeastern Nigeria caused by irregular payment of teachers 2 ̆ 7 wages, benefits, and <b>other</b> <b>remunerations.</b> This case study of 3 secondary schools in southeastern Nigeria sought to understand the impact of forced truancy by examining the relationship between forced truancy and youth delinquency. Although previous studies have explored the causes of truancy, few studies have addressed the effect of forced truancy created by incessant teachers 2 ̆ 7 strike. The theoretical framework that guided this study included Hirschi 2 ̆ 7 s social bond theory and Merton 2 ̆ 7 s social structure. Case studies were developed {{using data from the}} participants and review of documents. A maximum variation method was used for data collection through semi-structured that resulted in a review of archival records and open-ended interviews with students (S = 9), teachers (T = 8), and principals (SP = 4). Descriptive case analysis were used to identify common themes and patterns using constant comparative techniques. Implications for positive social change include identifying areas that need improvement and recommending to legislators and education policy makers for the best approach to addressing the problem, where {{it has the potential to}} eliminate teachers 2 ̆ 7 strike, reduce youth truancy, and improve student 2 ̆ 7 s academic performance...|$|R
40|$|Although {{fee-for-service}} payment {{may create}} {{an incentive for}} some physicians to make inappropriate clinical decisions that will maximize income, physicians are no more prone {{to this kind of}} behaviour than <b>other</b> professionals. <b>Remuneration</b> methods do not necessarily have a predictable effect upon practice, as shown by Hutchison and associates' report in this issue (see pages 653 to 661) that the capitation system used by Health Service Organizations in Ontario has not had the intended effect of reducing hospital utilization. However, many essential activities performed by physicians do not fit in a fee-for-service system.

The qualitative case methodology employed interviews and biographical questionnaires data collection methods. Data was gathered through interviewing student teachers and lecturers. Qualitative data analysis began by defining a priori themes and identifying parts of the interview transcripts that were relevant to these a priori themes. The initial coding was then refined by adding additional codes which emerged from the data to create a final coding template to interpret findings. Data analysis methods revealed that student teachers were motivated to join teaching by chance, important <b>other,</b> <b>remuneration,</b> vocation and interest developed through work experience. However prospective candidates did not get places to train as teachers {{on the basis of}} their motivation to become teachers. Further the study revealed that motives influenced “what”, “where”, and “how ” student teachers were learning.

Nongovernmental organization observers suggested that deeply embedded psychological and tribal bonds also made it difficult for many individuals whose forbearers had been slaves for generations, to break their bonds with former masters or their tribes. Some persons continued to link themselves to former masters because they believed their slave status had been divinely ordained and they feared religious punishment if that bond were broken.

40|$|Abstract Background Rewards are {{important}} in attracting, motivating and retaining the most qualified employees, and nurses are no exception to this rule. This makes {{the establishment of an}} efficient reward system for nurses a true challenge for every hospital manager. A reward does not necessarily have a financial connotation: non-financial rewards may matter too, or may even be more important. Therefore, the present study examines nurses' reward perceptions, in order to identify potential reward options. Methods To answer the research question "What do nurses consider a reward and how can these rewards be categorized?", 20 in-depth semi-structured interviews with nurses were conducted and analysed using discourse and content analyses. In addition, the respondents received a list of 34 rewards (derived from the literature) and were asked to indicate {{the extent to which they}} perceived each of them to be rewarding. Results Discourse analysis revealed three major reward categories: financial, non-financial and psychological, each containing different subcategories. In general, nurses more often mentioned financial rewards spontaneously in the interview, compared to non-financial and psychological rewards. The questionnaire results did not, however, indicate a significant difference in the rewarding potential of these three categories. Both the qualitative and quantitative data revealed that a number of psychological and non-financial rewards were important for nurses in addition to their monthly pay and <b>other</b> <b>remunerations.</b> In particular, appreciation for their work by others, compliments from others, presents from others and contact with patients were highly valued. Moreover, some demographical variables influenced the reward perceptions. Younger and less experienced nurses considered promotion possibilities as more rewarding than the older and more senior ones. The latter valued job security and working for a hospital with a good reputation higher than their younger and more junior colleagues. Conclusion When trying to establish an efficient reward system for nurses, hospital managers should not concentrate on the financial reward possibilities alone. They also ought to consider non-financial and psychological rewards (in combination with financial rewards), since nurses value these as well and they may lead to a more personalized reward system. </p...|$|R
