He admitted that he'd spent 4 months in treatment for the addiction, and publicly stated that the habit almost killed him at least once.

25|$|Recording {{became a}} natural process for all parties involved, {{although}} Madonna found difficulty {{in working with}} Benny Benassi who did not speak fluent English and had to use Alle Benassi as interpreter. A pop and EDM record, MDNA consisted of both introspective as well as upbeat songs. Lyrically the record explores themes such as partying, love for music, infatuation, as well as heartbreak, revenge and separation. The album's title is a triple entendre and makes allusion to the drug MDMA, thus facing negative reception from <b>anti-drug</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Heroin chic fashion drew much {{criticism}} and scorn, especially from <b>anti-drug</b> <b>groups.</b> Fashion designers, models such as Kate Moss and Jaime King, and movies such as Trainspotting were blamed for glamorizing heroin use. Then-U.S. president Bill Clinton condemned the look. Other commentators denied that fashion images made drug use itself more attractive. [...] "There {{is no reason}} to expect that people attracted to the look promoted by Calvin Klein and other advertisers... will also be attracted to heroin, any more than suburban teen-agers who wear baggy pants and backward caps will end up shooting people from moving cars", wrote Jacob Sullum in Reason magazine.|$|R

5000|$|In Northern Ireland, {{there have}} been {{hundreds}} of pipe bomb attacks since the mid 1990s (towards {{the end of the}} [...] "Troubles"). Most of the attacks have been launched by loyalist paramilitaries opposed to the 1994 ceasefires, especially the Red Hand Defenders (RHD) and Orange Volunteers (OV). However, they have also been used by Irish republican paramilitaries and by <b>anti-drugs</b> vigilante <b>group</b> Republican Action Against Drugs (RAAD). They are also used extensively in the south of Ireland by feuding criminals, including drug dealers, mainly in the capital city of Dublin.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Few {{investigations}} have assessed risk behaviours and social-structural contexts of risk among injecting drug users (IDUs) in Northeast India, where injecting {{drug use is}} the major route of HIV transmission. Investigations of risk environments are needed to inform development of effective risk reduction interventions. Methods This mixed methods study of HIV-positive IDUs in Manipur included a structured survey (n = 75), two focus groups (n = 17), seven in-depth interviews, and two key informant interviews. Results One-third of survey participants reported having shared a needle/syringe in the past 30 days; among these, all the men and {{about one-third of the}} women did so with persons of unknown HIV serostatus. A variety of social-structural contextual factors influenced individual risk behaviours: barriers to carrying sterile needles/syringes due to fear of harassment by police and "anti-drug" organizations; lack of sterile needles/syringes in drug dealers' locales; limited access to pharmacy-sold needles/syringes; inadequate coverage by needle and syringe programmes (NSPs); non-availability of sterile needles/syringes in prisons; and withdrawal symptoms superseding concern for health. Some HIV-positive IDUs who shared needles/syringes reported adopting risk reduction strategies: being the 'last receiver' of needles/syringes and not a 'giver;' sharing only with other IDUs they knew to be HIV-positive; and, when a 'giver,' asking other IDUs to wash used needles/syringes with bleach before using. Conclusions Effective HIV prevention and care programmes for IDUs in Northeast India may hinge on several enabling contexts: supportive government policy on harm reduction programmes, including in prisons; an end to harassment by the police, army, and <b>anti-drug</b> <b>groups,</b> with education of these entities regarding harm reduction, creation of partnerships with the public health sector, and accountability to government policies that protect IDUs' human rights; adequate and sustained funding for NSPs to cover all IDU populations, including prisoners; and non-discriminatory access by IDUs to affordable needles/syringes in pharmacies. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: The {{development}} of anti-drug antibodies against tumor necrosis factor inhibitors is a likely {{explanation for the}} failure of TNF-inhibitors in patients with spondyloarthritis. Our study determined the existence and clinical implications of ADAbs in axial spondyloarthritis patients. Methods: According to the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society classification criteria for axial spondyloarthritis, patients treated with adalimumab or infliximab were recruited consecutively. Serum samples were collected at enrollment to measure anti-drug antibodies and drug levels. Results: Of 100 patients, the mean duration of current TNF inhibitor use was 22. 3 ± 17. 9 months. Anti-drug antibodies were detected in 5 of 72 adalimumab users compared to 5 of 28 infliximab users (6. 9 % vs. 17. 9 %). Anti-drug antibodies-positive patients had a significantly higher body mass index than anti-drug antibodies-negative patients among both adalimumab (28. 4 ± 5. 9 kg/m 2 vs. 24. 3 ± 2. 9 kg/m 2, respectively, p = 0. 01) and infliximab users (25. 9 ± 2. 8 kg/m 2 vs. 22. 6 ± 2. 8 kg/m 2, respectively, p = 0. 02). During the median 15 -month follow-up period, drug discontinuation occurred more frequently in the <b>anti-drug</b> antibodies-positive <b>group</b> than the <b>anti-drug</b> antibodies-negative <b>group</b> (30. 0 % vs. 6. 5 %, respectively, p = 0. 04). In logistic regression, anti-drug antibodies positivity (OR = 5. 85, 95 % CI 1. 19 - 28. 61, p = 0. 029) and body mass index (OR = 4. 35, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 18. 69, p = 0. 048) were associated with a greater risk of stopping TNF inhibitor treatment. Conclusions: Our result suggests that the presence of anti-drug antibodies against adalimumab and infliximab as well as a higher body mass index can predict subsequent drug discontinuation in axial spondyloarthritis patients...|$|R
2500|$|The album {{title was}} {{announced}} by Madonna as MDNA {{during an interview}} on The Graham Norton Show on January 11, 2012. Solveig revealed that it was M.I.A. who had suggested the name to the singer, noting [...] "We were {{having a lot of}} fun with the initials. M.I.A. said, 'You should call your album MDNA because it would be a good abbreviation and spelling of your name.'" [...] It was then they realized that the initials proposed different explanations of the name, one of them being the DNA of Madonna. When discussing the album on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Madonna explained that the title is a triple entendre, representing both her name and her DNA, as well as a reference to the drug MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. The name MDNA as album title was condemned by Lucy Dawe, a spokesperson for the <b>anti-drugs</b> campaign <b>group</b> Cannabis Skunk Sense, who felt that Madonna's choice of the title was [...] "an ill advised decision".|$|R
