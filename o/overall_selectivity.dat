The order present in the LC phases has measurable effects on solute sorption, diffusivity, permeability, and selectivity, and can thus be used to tune the transport and separation of different species. The current work has focused on polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC), linear butadiene diol based side chain liquid crystalline polymer (LCP), and linear and crosslinked acrylate based LCP membranes. The focus was primarily on the separation of propylene and propane, a separation of significant industrial interest that is not easily achieved with current membrane technology. Polysulfone (Psf) and 4 -cyano- 4 ’-octylbiphenyl (8 CB) were used to fabricate polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) membranes.

Cell culture, immunoaffinity purification, polymerase chain reaction, and hybrid-capture detection were performed in the microtiter format to facilitate increased throughput by automation. The high sensitivity afforded by the assay provided quantitative detection of less than 0. 5 fg of extracellular HBV DNA from 25 microliters of cell culture supernatants, and drug-induced reductions in HBV titers greater than 100 -fold were easily measured. Fluorometric determination of total cellular DNA from the same 96 -well proliferating cell cultures allowed simultaneous evaluation of inhibition of cell growth, thus providing the ability to assess the <b>overall</b> <b>selectivities</b> of candidate compounds in a single experiment.

For the first time, multicomponent composite/hybrid asymmetric membrane was prepared by unifying two prominent concepts in gas separation membranes: (1) sealing or caulking asymmetric membrane imperfections by means of coating a highly permeable polymer layer, and (2) the incorporation of selective inorganic particle in polymer matrix generally known as the mixed matrix membrane. Asymmetric hollow fiber membranes (polysulfone (PSF)) was externally coated by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) solution containing suspended Cu 3 (BTC) 2 metal organic framework (MOF) by dip-coating technique. FESEM–EDS mapping confirmed the increase in Cu 3 (BTC) 2 adherence with increasing number of coating. The pure gas permeation experiment with CO 2, N 2 and CH 4 corroborated the contribution of Cu 3 (BTC) 2 particle to the overall composite/hybrid membrane performance. The gas permeation rates were increased with increasing number of PDMS–Cu 3 (BTC) 2 coating applied. CO 2 permeance increased from 69. 7 to 109. 2 × 10 − 6 cm 3 (STP) /cm 2 s cmHg after 5 consecutive coatings. In addition, the CO 2 /CH 4 and CO 2 /N 2 selectivities {{were found to be}} increased as well. Cu 3 (BTC) 2 contributed to higher affinity toward CO 2 due to the coordinatively unsaturated copper sites in its crystal network, which provide exceptionally high adsorptive capability for polar molecules, hence resulted in the increase of the <b>overall</b> <b>selectivities</b> and gas permeation rates across the membrane. Further development based on this study will create vast opportunities for future improvement on any commercially available gas separation membranes by implementing the method described herein...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Involved or {{implicated in}} a wide {{spectrum}} of diseases, trypsin-like serine proteases comprise well studied drug targets and anti-targets that can be subdivided into two major classes. In one class there is a serine at position 190 at the S 1 site, as in urokinase type plasminogen activator (urokinase or uPA) and factor VIIa, and in the other there is an alanine at 190, as in tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) and factor Xa. A hydrogen bond unique to Ser 190 protease–arylamidine complexes between OγSer 190 and the inhibitor amidine confers an intrinsic preference for such inhibitors toward Ser 190 proteases over Ala 190 counterparts. Results: Based on the structural differences between the S 1 sites of Ser 190 and Ala 190 protease–arylamidine complexes, we amplified the selectivity of amidine inhibitors toward uPA and against tPA, by factors as high as 220 -fold, by incorporating a halo group ortho to the amidine of a lead inhibitor scaffold. Comparison of Ki values of such halo-substituted and parent inhibitors toward a panel of Ser 190 and Ala 190 proteases demonstrates pronounced selectivity of the halo analogs for Ser 190 proteases over Ala 190 counterparts. Crystal structures of Ser 190 proteases, uPA and trypsin, and of an Ala 190 counterpart, thrombin, bound by a set of ortho (halo, amidino) aryl inhibitors and of non-halo parents reveal the structural basis of the exquisite selectivity and validate the design principle. Conclusions: Remarkable selectivity enhancements of exceptionally small inhibitors are achieved toward the uPA target over the highly similar tPA anti-target through a single atom substitution on an otherwise relatively non-selective scaffold. <b>Overall</b> <b>selectivities</b> for uPA over tPA as high as 980 -fold at physiological pH were realized. The increase in selectivity results from the displacement of a single bound water molecule common to the S 1 site of both the uPA target and the tPA anti-target because of the ensuing deficit in hydrogen bonding of the arylamidine inhibitor when bound in the Ala 190 protease anti-target...|$|R

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and lipo-peptides such as daptomycin offer themselves as a new potential class of antibiotics; however, further optimization is needed if AMPs are to find broad use as antibiotics. In the present work, eight analogues of mastoparan-X (MPX) were investigated, having side chain modifications in position 1, 8 and 14 to modulate peptide hydrophobicity. The self-association properties of the peptides were characterized, and the peptide-membrane interactions in model membranes were compared with the bactericidal and haemolytic properties. Alanine substitution at position 1 and 14 resulted in higher target selectivity (red blood cells versus bacteria), but also decreased bactericidal potency. For these analogues, the gain in target selectivity correlated to biophysical parameters showing an increased effective charge and reduction in the partitioning coefficient for membrane insertion.

We found that tuning to {{the orientation of the}} test stimulus depends {{on the size of the}} stimulation area. A significant sharpening of orientation tuning was induced by nCRF stimulation, with the magnitude of the effect increasing with the size of stimulation. The effect of the nCRF on the temporal dynamics of orientation tuning was also investigated by examining the tuning over a range of delays from stimulus onset. We found small but detectable changes in both the preferred orientation and the bandwidth of tuning over time when the classical receptive field (CRF) was stimulated alone. Stimulation in nCRF significantly increased the magnitude of these temporal changes. Thus, nCRF stimulation not only enhances the <b>overall</b> orientation <b>selectivity,</b> but also enriches the temporal dynamics of cortical neurones, which may increase the computational power of the visual cortex in information processing...|$|R
