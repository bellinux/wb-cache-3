25|$|Dual-sports, {{sometimes}} called dual-purpose or on/off-road motorcycles, are street legal machines {{that are also}} designed to enter off-road situations. Typically based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> bike chassis, they have added lights, mirrors, signals, and instruments that allow them to be licensed for public roads. They are higher than other street bikes, with a high center of gravity and tall seat height, allowing good suspension travel for rough ground.|$|E

25|$|On November 18, {{rebel forces}} stopped their advance on Kanyabayonga and withdrew, as {{to create a}} buffer zone between them and {{government}} forces and give a chance for peace talks. Following the halt in fighting between the rebels and the Army, government soldiers started looting the towns of Kirumba and Kayna, but were attacked by the local Mai-Mai group Pareco. The Mai-Mai had been helping the government forces {{since the start of}} the conflict in their fight against the rebels. The fighting left five Mai-Mai militiamen and one government soldier dead. The Army said the conflict was the fault of the Mai-Mai, who were attempting to hamper a routine deployment. Following the fighting government soldiers laid out two charred bodies of militiamen <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> track in Kirumba.|$|E
25|$|During 2010, Johnson {{managed to}} win his fifth {{consecutive}} championship, becoming the third driver who made up points to win the title since 1975. During the season, he scored two poles, 17 top fives, 23 top tens and six victories. He also remained the only driver {{to qualify for the}} Chase every year since its inception in 2004. He became the 12th, and currently the last driver, to win 50+ NASCAR races when he won at Bristol in March, and went up to 10th on the all-time wins list. Johnson was also named Driver of the Year for the fourth time in his career, joining Gordon as the only drivers to win the award that many times. He also managed to win Tony Stewart's charity race, the Prelude to the Dream, his first victory <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> oval.|$|E
25|$|These birds patrol open {{areas or}} scan for prey from a perch; {{they may also}} catch insects in flight. They take {{advantage}} of insects turned up by farm equipment or driven out by fire. A hunting Swainson's hawk will use several strategies. It hunts insects such as dragonflies or dobsonflies while in flight, flapping little as it rides a wind current and stoops upon a fly, grabbing it with its foot and immediately transferring the prey to its bill. It uses a similar strategy to grab individual free-tailed bats from flying streams of bats. Also, when dragonfly hordes are grounded by weather, Swainson's hawk will stand near groups sheltering from the wind and pluck at individual insects. Swainson's hawk closely follows both tractors and wild fires for injured or fleeing food. It will also run down insect prey on the ground. Occasionally a hawk will stand still <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> bank or elevated mound waiting for prey to appear. It commonly hunts from elevated perches such as telephone poles, stooping on prey when it is sighted.|$|E

25|$|Swayze, {{who was an}} FAA {{licensed}} pilot with {{an instrument}} rating, made the news on June 1, 2000, while flying with his dogs in his twin-engine Cessna 414 N414PS, from Van Nuys, California to Las Vegas, New Mexico. His plane developed a pressurization problem, causing Swayze to make a precautionary landing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> road in a housing complex in Prescott Valley, Arizona. The plane's right wing struck a light pole, but Swayze was unharmed. He locked the cockpit, left the aircraft in the subdivision, and obtained a ride—with his dogs—from a passing vehicle driven by Gary Bruso, in order to telephone the authorities. According to the police report, witnesses said that Swayze appeared to be extremely intoxicated and asked for help to remove evidence—an open {{bottle of wine and}} a 30-pack of beer—from the crash site. He made himself unavailable to police for several hours. It was later determined that the alcohol in question was not in the cabin, but stored in external storage compartments inaccessible in flight and that the probable cause of the accident was Swayze's physical impairment due to the cumulative effects of carbon monoxide from engine exhaust by-products, carbon monoxide from heavy tobacco use, and the loss of an undetermined amount of cabin pressurization, resulting in hypoxia.|$|E
25|$|On 20 May 1965, BirdAir pilot Ernest C. Brace landed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> {{landing strip}} in Laos {{that had just}} been overrun by the communists. He was {{promptly}} captured. Ambassador William H. Sullivan demanded information on Brace's status from the CIA station. Meanwhile, Lair commandeered a Beechcraft Baron to lead a rescue effort. Once in flight, he rounded up an improvised force of an Air America helicopter for the rescue, a Caribou for radio relay duties, and US-piloted T-28s for firepower. Ambassador Leonard Unger had previously granted Lair the authority to commandeer air assets and order air strikes in emergencies. As the Air America helo landed on the strip, {{for the first time}} ever, Lair directed strafing runs of the forests {{on either side of the}} runwayfirst the T-28s, then US F105 fighter-bombers. Sullivan was unaware of Unger's prior permission, and was angered by Lair's impromptu one-time use of air power. Sullivan demanded Lair be reprimanded. Station Chief Douglas Blaufarb, who was Lair's superior, backed Lair. This incident was not the only one concerning unauthorized air strikes. Ambassador Sullivan insisted on his authority to order and approve all air strikes within Laos. However, innocent civilians were being accidentally bombed. And American air power arrived according to the military's schedule, not the ambassador's.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} victim was 45-year-old Laquetta Gunther, who {{was found in}} an alley on December 26, 2005. She {{had been shot in}} the back of the head. DNA was {{recovered}} from the scene. The second victim was 34-year-old Julie Green, found January 14, 2006. She had also been shot in the back of the head. No DNA was recovered, but tire tracks were found. The tires were for a 2003 Taurus or Sable and in fact the exact tires were later found. Just over a month later, on February 24, 2006 police found the body of Iwana Patton, 35, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> road. She had been shot, but not in the back of the head, and possibly had struggled with her killer. DNA was recovered, along with a shell casing that allowed police to identify the make and model of pistol used. (.40-caliber Smith & Wesson Sigma Series VE.) Ballistics from recovered bullets and recovered DNA matched. Authorities received an anonymous telephone call describing the location of Patton's body, but the caller was eventually identified and questioned, and is not a suspect in the killings. All three women are believed to have worked as sex workers in the Daytona Beach area. Police believe the victims voluntarily accompanied their killer, possibly in a vehicle, and were subsequently murdered and dumped in the same area of Daytona Beach. The killer did not attempt to conceal the bodies.|$|E

500|$|The rink {{was built}} on the fairgrounds in front of a 15,000-seat {{permanent}} grandstand <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> auto racing track and leveled with what was described as [...] "tons of granite". With demands for over the 15,000 seats occupancy of the grandstands, the Crunch rented additional temporary bleachers. Since there was no scoreboards on or near the track Syracuse rented two large video screens to show the score, time remaining, penalty times, and other information. The installation of the temporary rink cost an estimated $400,000 and took {{a month and a half}} to complete.|$|E
