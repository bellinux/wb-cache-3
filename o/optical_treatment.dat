40|$|Infantile {{nystagmus}} (IN), previously {{known as}} congenital nystagmus, is an involuntary to-and-fro {{movement of the}} eyes that persists throughout life. IN {{is one of three}} types of early-onset nystagmus that begin in infancy, alongside fusion maldevelopment nystagmus syndrome and spasmus nutans syndrome. Optometrists may also encounter patients with acquired nystagmus. The features of IN overlap largely with those of fusion maldevelopment nystagmus syndrome, spasmus nutans syndrome, and acquired nystagmus, yet the management for each subtype is different. Therefore, the optometrist’s role is to accurately discern IN from other forms of nystagmus and to manage accordingly. As IN is a lifelong condition, its presence not only affects the visual function of the individual but also their quality of life, both socially and psychologically. In this report, we focus on the approaches that involve optometrists in the investigation and management of patients with IN.

40|$|Peripheral nerve {{injuries}} are common, and functional recovery is very poor. Beyond surgical repair of the nerve, {{there are currently}} no treatment options for these patients. In experimental models of nerve injury, interventions (such as exercise and electrical stimulation) that increase neuronal activity of the injured neurons effectively enhance axon regeneration. Here, we utilized optogenetics to determine whether increased activity alone is sufficient to promote motor axon regeneration. In thy- 1 -ChR 2 /YFP transgenic mice in which a subset of motoneurons express the light-sensitive cation channel, channelrhodopsin (ChR 2), we activated axons in the sciatic nerve using blue light immediately prior to transection and surgical repair of the sciatic nerve. At four weeks post-injury, direct muscle EMG responses evoked with both optical and electrical stimuli {{as well as the}} ratio of these optical/electrical evoked EMG responses were significantly greater in mice that received <b>optical</b> <b>treatment.</b> Thus, significantly more ChR 2 + axons successfully re-innervated the gastrocnemius muscle in mice that received <b>optical</b> <b>treatment.</b> Sections of the gastrocnemius muscles were reacted with antibodies to Synaptic Vesicle Protein 2 (SV 2) to quantify the number of re-occupied motor endplates.

40|$|Aims. Homonymous {{hemianopia}} (HH), {{a severe}} visual consequence of stroke, causes difficulties in detecting obstacles on the nonseeing (blind) side. We conducted {{a pilot study}} to evaluate the effects of oblique peripheral prisms, a novel development in <b>optical</b> <b>treatments</b> for HH, on detection of unexpected hazards when driving. Methods. Twelve people with complete HH (median 49 years, range 29 – 68) completed road tests with sham oblique prism glasses (SP) and real oblique prism glasses (RP).

The proportion of satisfactory responses to unexpected hazards on the blind side was higher in the RP than the SP drive (80 % versus 30 %; P= 0. 001), but similar for unexpected hazards on the seeing side. Conclusions. These pilot data suggest that oblique peripheral prisms may improve responses of people with HH to blindside hazards when driving and {{provide the basis for}} a future, larger-sample clinical trial.

40|$|Myopia is a {{condition}} in which the eye grows too long to match its optical focal length and represents a failure in both structure and function. Because of the potential risks of vision loss associated with high myopia, and also with corrective treatments such as refractive surgery and occasionally also with contact lenses, myopia should not be considered a benign condition. The hypothesis that hyperopic defocus from under-accommodation during near work is the driving stimulus in the progression of myopia, motivated studies of bifocal spectacles and progressive addition lenses, as <b>optical</b> <b>treatments</b> for the control of myopia progression, with limited success. In contrast, multifocal (MF) soft contact lenses (SCL) and orthokeratology (ortho-k) have proven to be more beneficial although the mechanisms underlying their anti-myopia effects are not understood. This dissertation, which describes 4 main studies, represents efforts to understand how spherical aberration influences the accommodative response and examines as an explanation for the myopia control effects of MF SCLs and ortho-k the possibility that induced changes in ocular spherical aberration decreases the lag of accommodation. First the effects of bifocal (BF) SCLs on the accommodative responses of young adult emmetropes and myopes were measured using a refractometer. Interpretation of these results proved to be problematic because direct measurements could not be made through the BF SCLs necessitating an assumption to be made about the effective add provided by the lenses. To address the above issues, in a follow-up study MF SCLs were used in conjunction with a wavefront sensor, allowing direct measurements of accommodative responses through the lenses. To analyze the collected data, the problem of determining a suitable method for calculating accommodative responses from wavefront aberrations had to be solved. Thus a second complementary study evaluated some of the methods used to calculate objective refractions from wavefront aberrations. The best results were obtained with a through-focus procedure, which used an optical quality metric to determine the best image plane and then calculated the accommodative error relative to this plane. The latter findings enabled a comprehensive analysis of the accommodative response data obtained in the MF SCL study, which demonstrated that spherical aberration and pupil diameter independently influence the accommodative response. Both center-distance and center-near MF lenses produced myopic shifts in the best image plane, the former by adding positive spherical aberration and the latter with the added power of the near addition. For pupils larger than approximately 5 mm, both MF lenses resulted in increased accommodative responses determined by a neural sharpness metric compared with those for a single vision distance lens. A fourth study measured the change in ocular aberrations induced by ortho-k and assessed the long term effect of ortho-k on the accommodative response of young adult myopes. This study found that ortho-k had similar effects to the center-distance MF SCL on aberrations and accommodative responses. An intriguing long-term outcome of this treatment was a dramatic increase in pupil size for all tested vergences. Explanations in terms of changes in both the pupillary light and near reflexes were considered. In summary, the studies reported in this dissertation point to complex interactions between spherical aberration, pupil size and the accommodative response, which may be deliberately manipulated in designing novel <b>optical</b> <b>treatments</b> for the control of myopia progression...|$|R

30|$|The above <b>optical</b> <b>treatment</b> can {{reflect the}} total {{absorption}} and overall photocurrent {{characteristics of the}} tandem SCs to some extent. However, perfect carrier transportation is generally not possible. A realistic device-oriented simulation for SCs requires performing an optical-electrical simulation by connecting the electromagnetic and carrier transport calculations simultaneously (see[9, 17, 18] for details). For the tandem cells, we need the optical-electrical simulations for both top and bottom junctions with carrier generation, recombination, transport, and collection mechanisms totally included. The carrier generation profile in each junction is from the electromagnetic calculation. This way, the actual external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) and short-circuit photocurrent densities (JaSi and JμcSi) of the two junctions can be achieved, yielding the Jsc[*]=[*]min(JaSi, JμcSi). With the dark current response calculated[18], we can construct the current–voltage (J-V) curve for the tandem TFSCs and carefully evaluate the cell performance, such as open-circuit voltage (Voc) and light-conversion efficiency (η) under various nanophotonic designs.|$|E

40|$|Results of {{a series}} of {{experiments}} designed to investigate the properties of thermally transferred optically stimulated luminescence (TT-OSL) in fine-grained quartz from Chinese loess are reported. This signal is confirmed as having two sources, recuperation and basic transfer, as proposed by earlier workers. The combined TT-OSL signal is shown to be due to electrons being ejected from electron traps that are very similar to the main OSL traps, and may indeed be identical to them. However, the dose dependences of the main OSL signal and the recuperated TT-OSL signal behave in a different way, with the TT-OSL signal showing slower onset of saturation. This behavior is interpreted in terms of the OSL production being limited by the number of available luminescence centres, rather than electron traps. This opens up the possibility of a new OSL dating procedure capable of extending the age range by almost an order of magnitude. The thermal and optical stabilities of the two sources of electrons that give rise to the TT-OSL signal are investigated. The basic TT-OSL signal {{is the result of the}} direct thermal transfer of electrons from a trap that is thermally deeper than the main OSL trap and which is optically insensitive. The recuperated TT-OSL is directly derived from an optically insensitive refuge trap which trapped electrons during the initial optical stimulation following irradiation. These two signals can be separated easily by a sequence of repeated thermal and <b>optical</b> <b>treatments</b> (or a single isothermal treatment). It is found that the recuperated TT-OSL signal is the major contributor to the TT-OSL signal when these procedures are carried out at 260 degrees Celsius for the fine-grained quartz studied here.
