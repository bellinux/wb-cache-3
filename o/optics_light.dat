2500|$|In {{physical}} <b>optics,</b> <b>light</b> {{is considered}} to propagate as a wave. This model predicts phenomena such as interference and diffraction, which are not explained by geometric optics. The speed of light waves in air is approximately 3.0×108m/s (exactly 299,792,458m/s in vacuum). The wavelength of visible light waves varies between 400 and 700nm, but the term [...] "light" [...] is also often applied to infrared (0.7–300μm) and ultraviolet radiation (10–400nm).|$|E

2500|$|In {{classical}} <b>optics,</b> <b>light</b> {{is thought}} of as electromagnetic waves radiating from a source. Often, coherent laser light is {{thought of as}} light that is emitted by many such sources that are in phase. Actually, the picture of one photon being in-phase with another is not valid in quantum theory. [...] Laser radiation is produced in a resonant cavity where the resonant frequency of the cavity {{is the same as}} the frequency associated with the atomic electron transitions providing energy flow into the field. [...] As energy in the resonant mode builds up, the probability for stimulated emission, in that mode only, increases. [...] That is a positive feedback loop in which the amplitude in the resonant mode increases exponentially until some non-linear effects limit it. [...] As a counter-example, a light bulb radiates light into a continuum of modes, and there is nothing that selects any one mode over the other. The emission process is highly random in space and time (see thermal light). In a laser, however, light is emitted into a resonant mode, and that mode is highly coherent. Thus, laser light is idealized as a coherent state. (Classically we describe such a state by an electric field oscillating as a stable wave. [...] See Fig.1) ...|$|E

50|$|Conventional lenses are {{ultimately}} limited by geometry.

Since the design space of conventional optics {{is limited to a}} combination of refractive index and surface structure, correcting for aberrations (for example through the use of achromatic or diffractive optics) leads to large, heavy, complex designs, and/or greater losses, lower image quality, and manufacturing difficulties.|$|E

Newton and most of his contemporaries, with the notable exception of Christiaan Huygens, hoped that classical mechanics would be able to explain all entities, including (in the form of geometric <b>optics)</b> <b>light.</b> Newton's own explanation of Newton's rings avoided wave principles and supposed that the light particles were altered or excited by the glass and resonated.|$|E
50|$|The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System {{was built}} as first next {{generation}} IACT {{in the western}} hemisphere.

This was perceived as a significant step up from the previous generation of instruments such as Whipple, HEGRA, and Cherenkov Array at Themis. The original VERITAS prototype telescope was installed in April 2003 and saw first light in February 2004.|$|E
50|$|If the {{refractive}} index of a medium is not constant, but varies gradually with position, {{the material is}} known as a gradient-index or GRIN medium and is described by gradient index <b>optics.</b> <b>Light</b> traveling through such a medium can be bent or focused, and this effect can be exploited to produce lenses, some optical fibers and other devices. Introducing GRIN elements in the design of an optical system can greatly simplify the system, reducing the number of elements by as much as a third while maintaining overall performance. The crystalline lens of the human eye {{is an example of a}} GRIN lens with a {{refractive index}} varying from about 1.406 in the inner core to approximately 1.386 at the less dense cortex. Some common mirages are caused by a spatially varying refractive index of air.|$|E

It has been demonstrated that pico projectors integrated in headsets could be used as interaction devices, e.g., using additional hand and finger tracking. The MIT Media Lab proposed a wearable gestural interface device named SixthSense. Chris Harrison developed a working system called Omnitouch. Finally, the Light Blue <b>Optics</b> <b>Light</b> Touch is yet another similar device. Lisa Cowan from UCSD showed a proof of concept of gesture recognition using shadow-occluding of the projector, called ShadowPuppets. A modified laser projector has been used to perform gesture recognition and finger tracking using laser-based active tracking techniques at the University of Tokyo (Smart Laser Scanner and Laser Sensing Display).|$|E
5000|$|A succinct {{expression}} of the diffraction limit is given in the spatial-frequency domain. In Fourier <b>optics</b> <b>light</b> distributions are expressed as superpositions {{of a series of}} grating light patterns in a range of fringe widths, technically spatial frequencies. It is generally taught that diffraction theory stipulates an upper limit, the cut-off spatial-frequency, beyond which pattern elements fail to be transferred into the optical image, i.e., are not resolved. But in fact what is set by diffraction theory is the width of the passband, not a fixed upper limit. No laws of physics are broken when a spatial frequency band beyond the cut-off spatial frequency is swapped for one inside it: this has long been implemented in dark-field microscopy. Nor are information-theoretical rules broken when superimposing several bands, [...] disentangling them in the received image needs assumptions of object invariance during multiple exposures, i.e., the substitution of one kind of uncertainty for another.|$|E

This model predicts phenomena such as interference and diffraction, which are not explained by geometric optics. The speed of light waves in air is approximately 3.0×108 m/s (exactly 299,792,458 m/s in vacuum). The wavelength of visible light waves varies between 400 and 700 nm, but the term [...] "light" [...] is also often applied to infrared (0.7-300 μm) and ultraviolet radiation (10-400 nm). [...] The wave model {{can be used to}} make predictions about how an optical system will behave without requiring an explanation of what is [...] "waving" [...] in what medium. Until the middle of the 19th century, most physicists believed in an [...] "ethereal" [...] medium in which the light disturbance propagated. The existence of electromagnetic waves was predicted in 1865 by Maxwell's equations. These waves propagate at the speed of light and have varying electric and magnetic fields which are orthogonal to one another, and also to the direction of propagation of the waves. Light waves are now generally treated as electromagnetic waves except when quantum mechanical effects have to be considered.|$|E
