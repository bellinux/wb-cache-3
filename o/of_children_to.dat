5|$|The ability <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> extract {{information}} from their environment rests on understandings of attentional {{behaviors such as}} pointing. Episodes of joint attention provide children {{with a great deal}} of information about objects by establishing reference and intention. Joint attention occurs within particular environments. The items and events in that environment provide a context that enables the child to associate meaning with a particular utterance. Joint attention makes relevant aspects of the context salient, helping children comprehend what is taking place.|$|E
5|$|Among Hindus, Shashthi {{is widely}} {{regarded}} the benefactor and protector of children and tutelary deity of every household. She is also worshipped as a bestower <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> the childless, and regarded as the foremost goddess for blessing children. One of the earliest scriptural sources to describe a ritual in her honour is the second century BCE composition Manava Grhya Sutra, appended to the Yajurveda (written between the 14th and 10th centuries BCE), which describes a ritual called Shashthi-kalpa. In the Shashthi-kalpa rite, which was described as performed on the sixth lunar day of every fortnight, Shashthi was invoked to provide sons, cattle, treasures, corn, and the fulfilment of wishes. Today, Shashthi continues to be worshipped on the sixth day {{of each of the}} twelve lunar months of the Hindu calendar, {{as well as on the}} sixth day after childbirth in the lying-in chamber where the birth has taken place. Shashthi is worshipped in a different form in each of these lunar months as the deities Chandan, Aranya, Kardama, Lunthana, Chapeti, Durga, Nadi, Mulaka, Anna, Sitala, Gorupini or Ashoka.|$|E
5|$|As the Game Boy Advance {{was able}} to handle newer, {{enhanced}} graphics, Ruby and Sapphire were the first games in the series that allowed up to four people to share information at one time, {{as opposed to the}} previous limit of two.

The team wanted the games to appeal to a large audience, so the game was designed to be easy enough for younger generations <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> play, but new features were added to bring the veteran gamers back.|$|E

She was born to Thomas Fermor, 1st Earl of Pomfret and his wife Henrietta Louisa Jeffreys, both of whom held court appointments. The couple were educated and frequently travelled with their growing brood <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> the continent. Charlotte, like her sisters, was well-educated; in 1746, she married the Hon. William Finch and had issue including George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{performed}} on data from large populations <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> study {{the relationship between the}} use of vaccines containing thiomersal, and autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Almost all of these studies have found no association between thiomersal-containing vaccines (TCVs) and autism, and studies done after the removal of thiomersal from vaccines have nevertheless shown autism rates continuing to increase. The only epidemiologic research that has found a purported link between TCVs and autism has been conducted by Mark Geier, whose flawed research has not been given any weight by independent reviews.|$|E

5|$|The Nixon {{presidency}} {{witnessed the}} first large-scale integration {{of public schools}} in the South. Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites. Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.|$|E
5|$|Whorf's views {{have been}} {{compared}} to those of philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and the late Ludwig Wittgenstein, both of whom considered language to have important bearing on thought and reasoning. His hypotheses have also {{been compared to}} the views of psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, whose social constructivism considers the cognitive development <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> be mediated by the social use of language. Vygotsky shared Whorf's interest in gestalt psychology, and he also read Sapir's works. Others have seen similarities between Whorf's work and the ideas of literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, who read Whorf and whose approach to textual meaning was similarly holistic and relativistic. Whorf's ideas have also been interpreted as a radical critique of positivist science.|$|E
