25|$|The {{appearance}} of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species in 1859 {{changed the way}} that taxonomists considered plant classification, incorporating evolutionary information into their schemata. The Darwinian approach led {{to the concept of}} phylogeny (tree-like structure) in assembling classification systems, starting with Eichler. Eichler, having established a hierarchical system in which the flowering plants (angiosperms) were divided into monocotyledons and dicotyledons, further divided into former into seven orders. Within the Liliiflorae were seven families, including Liliaceae and Amaryllidaceae. Liliaceae included Allium and <b>Ornithogalum</b> (modern Allioideae) and Asparagus.|$|E
500|$|Lock {{number one}} on the Kennet and Avon Canal is Hanham Lock, first opened [...] as part of the Avon Navigation in 1727. It is the first lock east of Netham, the {{upstream}} limit of the Floating Harbour, beyond the suburbs of the city of Bristol. A colliery wharf was sited just west of the lock, but the nearby coal mines closed in the 19th century. The river below Hanham Lock is considered to be tidal, as high tides often pass over the weir at Netham. Some spring tides pass over the weir at Hanham, making the river tidal up to Keynsham Lock. Heading east, the river passes the Somerdale Factory, on its southern bank, which was a chocolate production factory for Cadbury – originally built by the Fry family in the 1920s and 1930s. On the northern bank is Cleeve Wood, the primary scientific importance of which lies in its particularly large population of Bath asparagus (<b>Ornithogalum</b> pyrenaicum).|$|E
500|$|The Avon Gorge {{has been}} {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest because it supports some rare fauna and flora, including species unique to the gorge. There are a total of 24 rare plant species and two unique trees: the Bristol and Wilmotts's whitebeams. Other notable plants include Bristol Rock-cress, Bristol onion, Spiked Speedwell, Autumn Squill and Honewort. Other areas along the river which have this designation include Bickley Wood, Cleeve Wood, Hanham for its large population of Bath Asparagus (<b>Ornithogalum</b> pyrenaicum). Stidham Farm near Keynsham contains at least At least [...] of Pleistocene terrace-gravels, consisting of limestone clasts mainly, but also with Millstone Grit, Pennant Sandstone, flint and chert clasts. The site is of considerable importance for studies relating to the possible glaciation of the area, and of the terrace stratigraphy, particularly as {{it is one of}} only two accessible terrace deposits {{in this part of the}} Avon valley. Newton St Loe SSSI is also listed for geological reasons as it represents the only remaining known exposure of fossiliferous Pleistocene gravels along the River Avon. In conjunction with other sites within the wider area, they have aided the development of a scientific understanding of the history of early glaciation within South West England.|$|E

50|$|Later, in the United Kingdom, Bentham and Hooker {{published}} their {{volume on}} the Liliaceae in Latin in 1883. They divided the family into 20 tribes and placed <b>Ornithogalum</b> in the Scilleae tribe with 19 other genera, and indicated 70 species existed. In the German literature the taxonomic system of Engler completed its classification of the Liliaceae in 1888. He divided the family into 12 subfamilies and subordinate tribes. <b>Ornithogalum</b> was then placed in the Lilioideae subfamily and Scilleae tribe together with 21 other genera. The 70 species of <b>Ornithogalum</b> were then further divided into six sections, with section Heliocharmos corresponding to Baker's subgenus.|$|E

50|$|By the 1870s, as Baker {{describes}} in his {{revision of the}} family, the taxonomy of Liliaceae had become vast and complicated. Baker placed <b>Ornithogalum</b> in the tribe Scilleae, one of eight tribes into which he divided the Liliaceae. He then further subdivided the genus into seven subgenera. Of those, the first, Heliocharmos, corresponds to the modern <b>Ornithogalum</b> sensu stricto, with 23 species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ornithogalum</b> was {{originally}} described by Linnaeus in 1753, with 12 species, which he {{placed in the}} Hexandria Monogynia (six stamens, one carpel). When Adanson formed the Liliaceae family in 1763, he placed <b>Ornithogalum</b> there, where it largely remained till this very large family was dismembered {{towards the end of}} the 20th century.

50|$|There {{are also}} {{heterotypic}} synonyms, including <b>Ornithogalum</b> belgicum, described by Alexandre Louis Simon Lejeune in 1824 and renamed in Gagea belgica by Barthélemy Charles Joseph Dumortier in 1829.

50|$|Subsequently an {{alternative}} approach was suggested combining plastid gene sequences with nuclear DNA sequences, morphology and biogeography. This supported Manning et al.s Clade C within which <b>Ornithogalum</b> was contained, but the very large subgenus <b>Ornithogalum</b> was noted to still be heterogeneous, an issue which those authors had managed by treating the subgenus in seven sections. In contrast Martinez-Azorin et al. suggested reversing the sensu lato (lumping) approach of Manning et al., reverting to separate genera (splitting), thus resurrecting Galtonia and eighteen other genera.|$|E
50|$|Further {{analysis}} with wider sampling (70 compared to 40 taxa) {{and a third}} plastid region (matK) revealed the presence of three clades (A, B and C) within Ornithogaleae/Ornithogalum. Consequently, a new classification was proposed with three tribes and four genera, <b>Ornithogalum</b> corresponding to clade C, placed in tribe Ornithogaleae, but further subdivided into subgenera and sections, with 160 species. Galtonia was retained as a taxon, but at the subgenus level. An alternative approach was suggested by combining plastid gene sequences with nuclear DNA sequences, morphology, and biogeography. This supported Manning's clade C within which <b>Ornithogalum</b> was contained, but the very large subgenus <b>Ornithogalum</b> was noted to still be heterogeneous, which they had managed by treating it as seven sections.
