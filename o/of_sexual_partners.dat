5|$|Henry had a {{considerable}} sexual appetite and enjoyed {{a substantial number}} <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners,</b> resulting in {{a large number of}} illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many of whom he appears to have recognised and supported. It was normal for unmarried Anglo-Norman noblemen to have sexual relations with prostitutes and local women, and kings were also expected to have mistresses. Some of these relationships occurred before Henry was married, but many others took place after his marriage to Matilda. Henry had a wide range of mistresses from a range of backgrounds, and the relationships appear to have been conducted relatively openly. He may have chosen some of his noble mistresses for political purposes, but the evidence to support this theory is limited.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} caused by {{bacteria}} that spread from the vagina and cervix. Infections by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis are present in 75 to 90 percent of cases. Often multiple different bacteria are involved. Without treatment about 10 percent of those with a chlamydial infection and 40 percent of those with a gonorrhea infection will develop PID. Risk factors {{are similar to those}} of sexually transmitted infections generally and include a high number <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> and drug use. Vaginal douching may also increase the risk. The diagnosis is typically based on the presenting signs and symptoms. It is recommended that the disease be considered in all women of childbearing age who have lower abdominal pain. A definitive diagnosis of PID is made by finding pus involving the fallopian tubes during surgery. Ultrasound may also be useful in diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|The {{preference}} {{to seek out}} a <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> <b>of</b> the opposite sex is robust and ensures reproduction and survival of the species. Development of female-directed partner preference in the male is dependent on exposure of the developing brain to gonadal steroids synthesized during critical periods <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> differentiation <b>of</b> the central nervous system. In the absence of androgen exposure, a male-directed partner preference develops. The development and expression <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> preference has been extensively studied in rat, ferret, and sheep model systems. From these models {{it is clear that}} gonadal testosterone, often through estrogenic metabolites, cause both masculinization and defeminization of behavior during critical periods of brain development. Changes in the steroid environment during these critical periods result in atypical <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> preference. In this manuscript, we review the major findings which support the hypothesis that the organizational actions of sex steroids are responsible for <b>sexual</b> differentiation <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> preferences in select non-human species. We also explore how this information has helped to frame our understanding of the biological influences on human sexual orientation and gender identity...|$|R

In total, 35 men were interviewed individually and 43 men took part in five discussion groups. The grounded theory approach was used to analyse the data. Disclosure <b>of</b> HIV-status to <b>sexual</b> <b>partners,</b> regardless <b>of</b> condom use, was uncommon among the participants. The main reasons for not disclosing were: having sex with condom, fear <b>of</b> ruining the <b>sexual</b> encounter, fear <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> rejection, and fear of being stigmatized. Among those who disclosed their serostatus, certain considerations were taken into account when taking the decision to do so: the age <b>of</b> the <b>sexual</b> <b>partner,</b> the type <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partner,</b> and the intensity of the bond. Asking about and/or disclosing HIV status to <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> as a prevention strategy was rejected by most participants as stigmatizing.

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{examines}} exposure to perceived discrimination and {{its association with}} depression among low-income, Latina male-to-female transgender {{women as well as}} evaluates the impact <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> violence and mistreatment on depression. Methods A total of 220 Latina male-to-female transgender women who resided in Los Angeles, California, were recruited through community based organizations and referrals. Participants completed individual interviews using a structured questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 9). Perceived discrimination was assessed using a fifteen-item measure that was designed to assess the experiences of maltreatment of transgender individuals. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the association between perceived discrimination and depression after controlling for the presence of other variables. Results Of the sample, 35 % reported significant depressive symptoms (PHQ- 9 [*]â‰¥[*] 15). Additionally, one-third of the participants indicated that in the two weeks prior to the interviews they had thought either of hurting themselves or that they would be better off dead. The extent of perceived discrimination in this population was extensive. Many of the participants experienced discrimination on a daily basis (14 %) or at least {{once or twice a week}} (25 %) as demonstrated by a positive response to at least 7 of 15 items in the measure of perceived discrimination. Almost six out of ten participants admitted that they had been victims <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> violence. Those who reported more frequent discrimination were more likely to be identified with severe depression. There was also a notable association between self-reported history <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> violence and depression severity. Conclusions A significant association between depression severity and perceived discrimination was identified. How exposure to discrimination leads to increased risk of mental health problems needs additional investigation. Models investigating the association between perceived discrimination and depression among transgender women should include <b>sexual</b> <b>partner</b> violence as a potential confounding variable. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: In Tanzania is {{now more}} than two decades since the first cases of AIDS were {{reported}} in 1983. HIV infection has rapidly spread throughout the country, affecting all sectors of the society. Most infections are transmitted through hetero-sexual intercourse. The motorcyclists have multiple <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> and rarely did not use condoms regularly during the sexual intercourse with their <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> not their spouses. Problem that lies ahead of the motorcyclist community is the practice of unsafe sex, which puts them at risk of HIV/AIDS. Objective: To explore the extent to which personal, client and sexual desire factors influence acquisition <b>of</b> multiple <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> among the motorcyclist in Kinondoni Municipality. Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted along Bagamoyo road in Kinondoni Municipality in June 2016. This study employed both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. A total of 480 motorcyclists from 20 motorcycleâ€™s parking points were interviewed using a survey while an in-depth interview was used 10 respondents to get deeply information from the motorcyclists in their respective parking points. Results: Half of 480 motorcyclists interviewed (54. 2 %) reported to have had multiple <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> in the past 12 months prior the study. About 61. 7 % of the respondents did not use condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with a casual <b>sexual</b> <b>partner.</b> It was found that motorcyclist clients have a great influence on acquisition <b>of</b> multiple <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> among the motorcyclists. Also the clientâ€™s bodyâ€™s shape and good responses from the clients have great influence on acquisition <b>of</b> multiple <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> among the motorcyclist. In additional, sexual desire seems tempting to influence acquisition <b>of</b> multiple <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> among the motorcyclists. The opinions from the motorcyclist are as follows; to avoid multiple <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> among the motorcyclist reported as 49. 4 said motorcyclists should avoid all kinds of influences from their clients, 40. 2 % said health education should be provided to the motorcyclists and 10. 4 % of the respondents said motorcyclists should engage in sports to avoid sexual influence. Conclusion: This study found that the majority of commercial motorcyclists have multiple <b>sexual</b> <b>partners.</b> Also majority <b>of</b> them did not use condoms regularly with casual partners. It was reported that the motorcyclistâ€™s clients have great influence in the acquisition <b>of</b> multiple <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> among the motorcyclist. The study also reveals that sexual desire contributes to the acquisition <b>of</b> multiple <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> among the motorcyclists. Recommendations: Special efforts intervention such as health education should be done to the motorcyclists so that they can change their behaviour <b>of</b> having multiple <b>sexual</b> <b>partners.</b> The district government, Institutions, NGOs and other stakeholders should work together to make condoms are available and affordable, also to sensitizing and encourage the motorcyclists on the use of condoms regularly and consistently. Further research should be conducted to assess the sexual relationship between multiple <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> and their clients...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to the mentioned health risks (like unwanted pregnancies and infection transmissions), other risks {{have been associated with}} early sexual activity. For example, a recent study (2017) found that those who start having sex at an earlier age have higher risks of: not using a condom; not having good memories of that first experience; and having had that relationship for non-autonomous reasons (such as partner pressure, peer pressure or the influence of substance use). This article also summarizes other risks (found in previous studies) associated with earlier sex: having an increased number <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> or of casual sexual partners; perpetrating or being a victim of forced sex; engaging in paid sex; depression and behavior problems.|$|E
25|$|The most {{effective}} way of preventing STIs is by not having sex. Some vaccinations may also decrease the risk of certain infections including hepatitis B and some types of HPV. Safer sex practices such as use of condoms, having a smaller number <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners,</b> and being in a relationship where each person only has sex with the other also decreases the risk. Circumcision in males may be effective to prevent some infections. Most STIs are treatable or curable. Of the most common infections, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis are curable, while herpes, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, and HPV are treatable but not curable. Resistance to certain antibiotics is developing among some organisms such as gonorrhea.|$|E
