40|$|The {{question}} of how exposure to dioxins might affect only males and why it affects preferentially male embryos in the Seveso data presented by Mocarelli et al. remains intriguing. This enigma {{can be explained by}} the ovopathy concept, which addresses the determination of both the sex and the condition of the progeny. Antiandrogenic properties of dioxin alter the sperm-transit time and mating behavior, which provoke delay of fertilization of the oocyte (postovulatory <b>overripeness</b> of the oocyte). Antiestrogenic properties of dioxin during mid-cycle compromise both mucus liquefaction and maturation of the oocyte (preovulatory <b>overripeness</b> ovopathy). A positive dose–response of male-biased pathologic conceptuses is often followed by a negative one due to “vanishing male conceptuses. ” This dose–response fallacy is present in animal experiments and explains many otherwise unexplained phenomena related to dioxin contamination and other high-risk conceptions. Key words: Seveso, dose–response fallacy, postovulatory <b>overripeness</b> ovopathy, preovulatory <b>overripeness</b> ovopathy, vanishing male conceptuses.

40|$|Seasonal Preovulatory <b>Overripeness</b> Ovopathy (SPOO) is one {{explanation}} for seasonal variations in the occurrence of congenital anomalies. This concept entails that during some seasons the preovulatory phase {{of the development of}} the human egg is lengthened, causing congenital anomalies. Although the concept of SPOO provides an innovative explanation for the etiology of congenital anomalies, its dissemination in the scientific world has been limited. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explain this limited dissemination through a critical examination of the concept itself. To do this we analyzed the degree in which this concept has a sufficient informative content and explanatory power, following criteria formulated by Popper. It is concluded that descriptions of the concept of SPOO are ambiguous. Thus the concept cannot be tested and has a limited informative content. The explanatory power of the SPOO concept remains unclear, in itself and relative to competing explanations. Further one of its basic assumptions, seasonal variation of the length of the preovulatory phase due to an endogenous mechanism, has been refuted. Future research should better be directed to causes of preovulatory <b>overripeness</b> ovopathy (OO) other than seasonality. This preovulatory OO offers an innovative view on the etiology of congenital anomalies...|$|E
40|$|The {{aroma of}} sweet Fiano wine, the most {{representative}} non-aromatic white wine variety in southern Italy, was evaluated by sensory and instrumental analysis {{to determine the}} influence of grape <b>overripeness,</b> drying and Botrytis cinerea infection. Sensory descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the sensory properties of wines. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography/olfactometry (GC/O) techniques were used to identify and to determine the content of free and bound volatile compounds and their odour impact. A sensory descriptive analysis had revealed that the sensory descriptors such as citrus jam, dried apricot, dried figs, prune, honey and coconut, occur in sweet Fiano wine more than in base Fiano wine. Thirty five free volatile compounds had higher levels in sweet Fiano wine than in base Fiano wine, these components were mostly terpenes, β-damascenone, lactones, aldehydes and ketones. Moreover higher levels of terpenes, β-damascenone, benzyl alcohol and 2 -phenylethanol were found in the bound volatile fraction of sweet Fiano wine. The main odour impact compounds in sweet Fiano wine were nerol, geraniol and linalool (orange flowers), vitispirane (camphor), lactones such as γ-nonalactone (coconut), δ-decalactone and γ-decalactone (apricot) and 1 -octen- 3 -ol (mushroom).

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the opinion of Yovich et al, who documented Goldenhar syndrome in one of possibly monozygous twin brothers conceived by in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer, I suggest that ovopathy {{is the cause of}} this anomaly. The eight criteria which have to be met before a condition can be said to be caused by <b>overripeness</b> ovopathy are shown to be satisfied. My conclusion remains that, in general, sporadically occurring Goldenhar variants, as distinct from familial cases, should be considered to be just casualities in the broad 'continuum of reproductive wastage' seen in high risk conceptions, one of which is IVF. This concept increases our understanding of human variation not satisfactorily explained by Mendelian inheritance...|$|E

Several internal defects may deteriorate greatly this fruit: (a) creases and/or large voids in the flesh, (b) <b>overripeness</b> and (c) bruises due to impact. The objective {{of this research was}} to develop a feasible non-destructive procedure for detecting these defects in individual fruits, based on acoustic impulse response. A device consisting of a microphone, structural elements and a mechanical impact generator was designed and tested. Good and defective seedless watermelons were tested with the acoustic device. Spectral parameters were examined as potential non-destructive predictors of internal disorders. Waveband magnitude parameters, obtained by summing the magnitude of the spectrum between two frequencies in a specified band width (always including between 40 and 500 Hz), were the acoustic parameters showing the best ability to detect internal disorders...|$|E
40|$|A {{great number}} of case reports on {{concordant}} and discordant twins with oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS) suggest {{that there might be}} an association between reproductive abnormalities, twinning and OAVS. The etiology of OAVS is unknown, but may involve epigenetic dysregulation of the oocyte or early embryo. We collected data on fertility and pregnancy outcome of 72 parents of patients with sporadic OAVS. We also evaluated prospective follow-up data on 3. 372 fetuses and children conceived by intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). Parental age, duration of menstrual cycle and the incidence of spontaneous abortion was not different when compared to the German population. However, there is an excess of parents who have used assisted reproductive techniques (ART; retrospective P = 0. 038, prospective P = 0. 023) and an excess of twins among naturally conceived patients with OAVS (P = 0. 0025). An excess of ART conceptions and monozygotic twinning in OAVS is compatible with the concept of <b>overripeness</b> ovopathy as proposed by Jongbloet (Maandschr Kindergeneeskd 36 : 352 - 367, 1968) ...|$|E
40|$|Plums (Prunus salicina {{cultivar}} 'Songold') were harvested {{on three}} dates, 7 days apart, from {{top and bottom}} sectors of trees trained on a palmette system. Fruit maturity at harvest, assessed in terms of skin ground colour, flesh firmness, soluble solids, titratable malic acid and soluble solids to acid ratio, was significantly affected by harvest date and canopy position. Delayed harvest was associated with advanced maturity, and, within trees, bottom fruit were more mature than top fruit. Similarly, these parameters measured after storage at - 0. 5 °C for 10 days, followed by 18 days at 7. 2 °C and 7 days at 10 °C, indicated that fruit quality was also affected by harvest date and canopy position. Other quality indices affected were gel breakdown, <b>overripeness</b> and decay. Best overall fruit quality was obtained in earlier harvested fruit with a ground colour of 2. 6 as measured with an apple colour meter and a flesh firmness of 5. 2 kg. More mature fruit developed the most gel breakdown, and in fruit harvested last, concentrations of N, P, K, Ca and Mg were lower than in earlier harvested fruit, and were least optimal for good fruit quality. Susceptibility to post-harvest decay was also highest in fruit harvested at the later date. © 1993. Articl...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the associations of fecundity and childlessness with month of conception {{and to find}} a causal mechanism for these associations, we reanalyzed some of our previous data according to the predictions of the seasonal optimal ripening oocyte (SOptRO) and seasonal preovulatory <b>overripeness</b> ovopathy (SPrOO) hypotheses. Prime and minor SOptRO months as well as high-risk, no-risk, and very high risk SPrOO months were defined {{on the basis of}} a priori knowledge of the existence of ovulatory and anovulatory seasons in mammals and of the general birth distribution in Europe. The month of birth was assessed among 899 mothers with three or more children and 388 childless women extracted from a 1 % sample of the Austrian population. The women with three or more children were born in excess during the prime and less often during the minor SOptRO months (χ 2 = 2. 81; p= 0. 045; relative risk = 1. 16; 95 % CI = 1. 01 – 1. 33). This is in line with the SOptRO predictions. The childless women were more frequently born during the highrisk SPrOO months compared to the no-risk months but less often during the very high risk months. The linear trend (χ 2 = 8. 43; p = 0. 009) is in line with the SPrOO predictions. We suggest that fecundity and childlessness are dependent on the gradient of oocyte maturation reflected by mother’s month of birth, which may modulate future constitution...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Several {{conditions}} apparent at birth, e. g., neural tube defects (NTDs) and cardiac anomalies, {{are associated}} with polymorphisms in folate-related genes, such as the 677 C [...] > T polymorphism of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. Similar associations have been established for several constitutional chronic diseases in adulthood, such as schizophrenia, cardiovascular diseases, dementia, and even neoplasias in different organ systems. This spectrum of developmental anomalies and constitutional diseases {{may be linked to}} high-risk conceptions related to preovulatory <b>overripeness</b> ovopathy (PrOO). Some developmental anomalies, such as NTDs, are to a large extent prevented by supplementation of folic acid before conception, but supplementation does not seem to prevent cardiovascular disease or cognitive decline. These diverging results can be elucidated by introduction of the PrOO concept, as MTHFR polymorphisms and inherent low folate levels induce both non-optimal maturation of the oocyte and unsuccessful DNA methylation and demethylation, i. e. epigenetic mutations. The PrOO concept is testable and predicts in a random population the following: (1) female carriers of specific genetic MTHFR variants exhibit more ovulatory disturbances and inherent subfecundity traits, (2) descendents from a carrier mother, when compared with those from a wild-type mother, are more frequently conceived in PrOO high-risk conditions and, thus, (3) disadvantaged in life expectancy. If so, some MTHFR polymorphisms represent a novel, genetically determined, PrOO high-risk conception category comparable to those which are environmentally and behaviorly influenced. These high-risk conditions may cause developmental anomalies and defective epigenetic reprogramming in progeny. The interaction between genetic and environmental factors is a plausible mechanism of multifactorial inheritance...|$|E
40|$|Ruth {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{examples}} of literary decadence in Estonian literature, a manifestation of the discourse of decadence that dominated the fin-de-siècle period. The function of this discourse was on the one hand the expression of the experience of modernity, and on the other, its critique. Just as in the majority of examples of literary decadence, Ruth is a ”studied composition”, relying more on cultural intertexts than on direct observation of the world of experience. Many of the explicit or implicit allusions latent in Ruth can be traced back to the texts of writers who generated syntheses of decadent sensibility: T. Gautier, C. Baudelaire, P. Bourget, F. Nietzsche, and O. Weininger. This article focuses on traces of the idea of affirmative aesthetic decadence in the Gautier-Baudelaire tradition, and Bourget’s ambivalent treatment of decadence as these are made visible in Ruth. Ruth exhibits the idea of affirmative aesthetic decadence of the German variety, though the negative connotations of decadence come to overwhelm the positive at the end of the 19 th century. Negative nuances are mediated through Bourget’s ambivalent renderings of decadence, and specifically through his model of the decadentdilettante. While Bourget admired the decadent-dilettante as a symbol of European culture’s high level of refinement, it also signals <b>overripeness</b> and cultural decline. The veiled opposition to the decadent-dilettante attitude to life is carried in Ruth both by the narrator and the protagonist Ruth herself. The function of the opposition is to critique both the negative concept of decadence and more broadly, an overmodernized, therefore declining Europ...|$|E
40|$|As first shown {{more than}} 100 years ago, {{fertilization}} of an aged (overripe) egg increases {{the rate of}} malformations and embryonic loss in several vertebrates, including possibly humans as well. Since the molecular events in aging eggs may be similar in these species, we established in the frog Xenopus tropicalis a defined protocol for delayed fertilization of eggs. A three-hour delayed fertilization led to {{a dramatic increase in}} malformation and mortality. Gene expression profiling revealed that 14 % of the polyadenylated maternal transcripts were downregulated upon aging. These transcripts were not degraded, but rather deadenylated as shown for specific maternal mRNAs. The affected transcripts are characterized by a relatively short 3 ′UTR and a paucity of cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPE) and polyadenylation signals (PAS). Furthermore, maternal mRNAs known to be deadenylated during egg maturation as well as after fertilization were preferentially deadenylated in aged eggs. Taken together our analysis of aging eggs reveals that unfertilized eggs are in a dynamic state that was previously not realized. On the one hand deadenylation of transcripts that are typically deadenylated during egg maturation continues and this implies <b>overripeness</b> of the aged egg in the truest sense of the word. On the other hand transcripts that normally are deadenylated after fertilization loose their poly(A) in the aged egg and this implies that the egg awaiting fertilization starts processes that are normally only observed after fertilization. Based on our novel finding we postulate that the imbalance of the polyadenylated maternal transcripts upon egg aging contributes to the loss of developmental potential. Based on this hypothesis the developmental consequences of downregulation of specific transcripts can be analyzed in future...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{preponderance}} of births between April and June {{in patients with}} anorexia nervosa (AN) and other eating disorders (EDs) has recently been explained by a higher environmental temperature at conception. This hypothesis, however, does not explain some other irregularities {{in the month of}} birth distribution in contrast to the seasonal preovulatory <b>overripeness</b> ovopathy (SPrOO) and seasonal optimally ripened oocytes (SOptRO) hypotheses. METHOD: The month of birth distribution of 408 patients with EDs from Southeast England and of 199 patients from Australia has been reassessed in relation to previously determined high-risk and low-risk months based on a priori knowledge from mammals and on the physiologic birth peaks and troughs in humans at population level. The differences between high-risk and low-risk months were assessed by conventional chi-square analyses and by relative risks (RRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: In England, fewer AN patients (n = 259) were born at the peaks of the total birth pattern, that is, during the 2 low-risk months, and more were born during the transitional stages, that is, during the remaining 10 high-risk months (p =. 004; RR = 1. 66 [95 % CI = 1. 13 - 2. 41]). After the addition of 149 other ED patients (n = 408), this result remained (p =. 005; RR = 1. 47 [95 % CI = 1. 10 - 1. 97]). Similar results were found in 199 ED patients from Australia (p =. 009; RR = 1. 70 [95 % CI = 1. 09 - 2. 64]). CONCLUSION: ED patients appear to be more frequently conceived during the transitional stages of the ovulatory pattern due to SPrOO and less frequently at the ovulatory peaks due to SOptRO. The pathophysiologic processes of oocyte maturation in estrous animals and the circumstantial evidence of similar phenomena in humans are more appropriate to explain these coincidences than the temperature at conception hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] breakdown (GB) and <b>overripeness</b> (OR) remain the biggest internal Problems with Prunus armeniaca L. ‘Imperial’, which makes the biggest contribution to the total volume of apricots exported from South Africa per annum. Prunus salicina L. ‘Pioneer’, an early season South African plum cultivar, ripens quickly {{on and off the}} tree which results in rejections for soft fruit at packing and on arrival overseas. ‘Songold’, a yellow, midseason plum cultivar tends to develop GB and OR during cold-storage in some seasons, which renders the fruit inedible and results in high rejection rates. Prompt cooling and good temperature management are essential to lower the rate of physiological deterioration of stone fruit. In some commercial depots in South Africa, forced air cooling (FAC) of stone fruit can take as long as 48 to 72 h, {{depending on the type of}} packaging. Consequently, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of the rate and duration of FAC on the fruit quality of different stone fruit cultivars. Fruit was subjected to the following FAC rates at a delivery air temperature of - 1. 0 °C to a pulp temperature of 0 °C for 6 h, 12 h, 24 h stepwise cooling and 48 h stepwise cooling for the apricot, and 12 h, 24 h, 48 h stepwise cooling, and 72 h stepwise cooling for the two plum cultivars. The fruit was evaluated after cold-storage and a simulated shelf-life period. The trial was conducted in two consecutive seasons. ‘Imperial’ apricots had the best internal quality after 6 h of FAC, ‘Pioneer’ plums were not affected by FAC rate or duration, and ‘Songold’ plums had the best internal quality when FAC was applied for 12 h and longer. These results on plums demonstrate that cultivar differences must be considered when drawing up handling protocols for stone fruit, as a blanket recommendation may lead to the induction of quality defects...|$|E
