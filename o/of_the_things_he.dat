One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> did {{to give a}} helping hand to his home town was to {{convince}} RCA to open a record-pressing plant there. Those who needed {{to raise funds for}} local projects like Boys' and Girls' Clubs found him always ready to do whatever was needed.|$|E

25|$|In 1923 Sundar Singh {{made the}} last of his regular summer visits to Tibet and came back exhausted. His preaching days were {{apparently}} over, and in the next years, in his own home or those of his friends in the Simla hills he gave himself to meditation, fellowship, and writing some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> had lived to preach.|$|E

25|$|Jerry Only and Doyle, meanwhile, {{moved to}} Vernon, New Jersey {{to work at}} their father's machine parts factory full-time. Jerry Only had married and had a {{daughter}} and became more serious about his Christian faith, regretting some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> had done with the Misfits. In 1987 he and Doyle formed the short-lived Kryst the Conqueror, a Christian heavy metal band with barbarian imagery.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} {{to issues of}} Civil Rights, Fonda has been an opponent of oil developments and their adverse effects on the environment. In 2017, while on a trip with Greenpeace to protest oil developments, Fonda criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying at the summit on climate change in Paris, known as the Paris agreement, Trudeau [...] "talked so beautifully of needing {{to meet the requirements}} of the climate treaty and to respect and hold to the treaties with indigenous people...and yet he has betrayed every one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> committed to in Paris." ...|$|E
500|$|Mankiewicz {{had thought}} of turning Solitaire into a black woman, with Diana Ross as his primary choice. However, Broccoli and Saltzman decided to stick to Fleming's {{description}} of a white woman, and after thinking of Catherine Deneuve, Jane Seymour, {{who was in the}} TV series The Onedin Line, was cast for the role. Yaphet Kotto was cast while doing another movie for United Artists, Across 110th Street. Kotto reported one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> liked in the role was Kananga's interest in the occult, [...] "feeling like he can control past, present and future".|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a sign he {{has missed}} him," [...] remarked Hockins, {{beginning}} {{to fill his}} pipe--the tobacco, not the musical, one! [...] "I've always observed that when Ebony becomes desperate, and knows he can't git hold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he's</b> arter, he makes a reckless plunge, with a horrible yell, goes right down by the head, and disappears like a harpooned whale." ...|$|R
60|$|Morris put {{his hands}} in his pockets and looked down on them both, with a curious feeling of having done {{something}} which he might repent of. He felt in a way cut off from <b>the</b> satisfactory ending <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> had planned.|$|R

500|$|Bill Veeck said of Stengel in 1966, {{soon after}} the manager's retirement, [...] "He was never {{necessarily}} the greatest of managers, but any time he had a ball club that {{had a chance to}} win, he'd win." [...] Stengel's American League rival, Al Lopez, once said of him [...] "I swear I don't understand some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> does when he manages". Though platooning survives, Stengel's intuitive approach to managing is no longer current in baseball, replaced by the use of statistics, and the advent of instant replay makes obsolete Stengel's tendency to charge from the dugout to confront an umpire over a disputed call.|$|E
500|$|English actor Chris Coxon {{played the}} role of SpongeBob. Coxon was a fan of the series and said [...] "If I'd been told a year ago that I would be playing SpongeBob today I would have loved it, {{although}} I'm not sure I would have believed it." [...] Coxon admitted it was difficult to adapt the show into a musical. He remarked [...] "It is difficult because you are trying to recreate this character that is so fluid on screen. For example I'm just getting used to my square costume, although it does have an incredible design, so that, although I am restricted, I can do a lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> does in the cartoon." ...|$|E
500|$|To-date, Deja remains {{best known}} for animating several of Disney's most famous villains, admitting to preferring animating villains over heroes. However, after The Lion King, Deja finally {{decided to take a}} break from animating villains in order to avoid repeating himself, {{subsequently}} refusing to animate villain Judge Claude Frollo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) in favor of working on Hercules from Hercules (1997), along with Mickey Mouse in the animated short Runaway Brain (1995). Comparing Scar to other villains that he has played, Irons said that he [...] "measures very highly," [...] having [...] "charm," [...] "Machiavellian qualities" [...] and being [...] "iconic in some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> says." ...|$|E

60|$|Peter asked 'im {{to listen}} to reason, {{but it was all}} no good. He'd got the pawn-ticket, and at last Peter, forgetting all he'd said to Ginger Dick about using bad langwidge, took 'is clothes off, one by one, and dashed 'em on the floor, and told Isaac some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>'e</b> thought <b>of</b> 'im.|$|R
60|$|Affonso Henriques {{was very}} pleased with himself. He made a jest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affair, and invited his intimates to laugh with him. But Emigio Moniz and <b>the</b> elder members <b>of</b> his council refused to laugh. They looked with awe upon a deed that went perilously near to sacrilege, and implored him to take their own sober view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> had done.|$|R
500|$|BBC News {{reported}} that [...] "According to , his storyboard led to delays, disputes over broadcast standards and a threatened walk {{out by the}} animation department." [...] However, Al Jean disputed this, saying [...] " [...] didn't walk out. Obviously they didn't. We've depicted the conditions in a fanciful light before." [...] Commenting on hiring Banksy to create the titles, Jean joked, [...] "This {{is what you get}} when you outsource." [...] Although conceding to the fact that The Simpsons is largely animated in South Korea, Jean went on to state that the scenes shown in titles are [...] "very fanciful, far-fetched. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> depicts are true. That statement should be self-evident, but I will emphatically state it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Caught Up" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} contemporary critics. Andrew McGregor of BBC called the song [...] "meaty" [...] and [...] "hip-grinding". Jon Caramanica of Blender magazine {{referred to the}} song like a [...] "Southern marching band performing late-'80s R". He characterized Usher's voice playing like a rhythm instruments. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine complimented Dre and Vidal for producing an old-sounding music without sampling records, calling it [...] "super-tight" [...] alongside [...] "Follow Me", another song from the album. Andy Kellman of Allmusic complimented the song as one of Usher's best moments in the album, together with [...] "Burn". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called it a [...] "thunderous song" [...] from the album, adding that it gave Usher [...] "a chance to do two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> does best: strut and pander".|$|E
500|$|Friday's {{behaviour}} on Reading away trips was {{unpredictable and}} erratic: {{in the words}} of teammate John Murray, [...] "Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> did were funny but other times they were just mad". On the way back from one away match, the team bus pulled over and Friday noticed that they were beside a cemetery. Friday jumped over the wall and stole some stone angels from a grave, intending to place them beside the club chairman Frank Waller, who was sleeping on the coach. When he returned, Hurley sternly told him that [...] "you must never ever desecrate a graveyard"—Friday dutifully returned the statues. On another occasion, Friday reacted to the news that a teammate had smuggled a girl into his hotel room by kicking the door in. Later on the same night he walked into the bar carrying a swan that he had found in the hotel grounds.|$|E
60|$|His arm {{was passed}} beneath Terkoz's arm {{from behind and}} his hand and forearm encircled <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> Terkoz's neck. It was <b>the</b> half-Nelson <b>of</b> modern wrestling which the untaught ape-man had {{stumbled}} upon, but superior reason showed him in an instant <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> had discovered. It was the difference to him between life and death.|$|R
60|$|Ian {{is on the}} {{staircase}} now, in the punt, and out upon the flood with a stout rope fast to the stern and to the door-post. Panting from his recent exertions, and half-wild with the mingled excitement, danger, novelty, and fun <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>he</b> draws two or three long breaths as he grasps the sculls and looks quickly round.|$|R
6000|$|... "I desire no immunity," [...] flashed {{back the}} young seminarist, stung by this fresh goad. After all, he was nobly born, and <b>the</b> traditions <b>of</b> his class were strong upon him--stronger far than the seminarist {{schooling}} in humility. He {{owed it to}} himself, to his honour, to be killed rather than avoid <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> had done.|$|R
500|$|When Locke {{began writing}} {{the letters that}} would {{eventually}} become Some Thoughts on Education, he was addressing an aristocrat, but the final text appeals to a much wider audience. For example, Locke writes: [...] "I place Vertue [...] as {{the first and most}} necessary of those Endowments, that belong to a Man or a Gentleman." [...] James Axtell, who edited the most comprehensive edition of Locke's educational writings, has explained that although [...] "he was writing for this small class, this does not preclude the possibility that many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> said about education, especially its main principles, were equally applicable to all children" [...] (Axtell's emphasis). This was a contemporary view as well; Pierre Coste, in his introduction in the first French edition in 1695, wrote, [...] "it is certain that this Work was particularly designed for the education of Gentlemen: but this does not prevent its serving also for the education of all sorts of Children, of whatever class they are." ...|$|E
500|$|Both men {{are portrayed}} as very incompetent, in [...] "Nob and Nobility", it takes Prince George a week {{to put on a}} pair of {{trousers}} by himself, eventually putting them on his head. George relies heavily on Blackadder in the third (Mr. E. Blackadder) series, even while Blackadder despises George for his immense wealth and complete inability to rectify problems in his life. While George is considered [...] "moronic" [...] and [...] "idiotic", he is helpful, loyal, and is aware he is not very intelligent, describing himself as [...] "thick as a whale omelette". In a 2008 retrospective, co-star Stephen Fry said George's keenness for self-improvement was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> felt made the character likeable. In [...] "Duel and Duality," [...] the final episode of the third series, after a sexual encounter with the Duke of Wellington's nieces, this princely incarnation of George is struck by a point-blank shot from the vengeful Wellington's pistol and killed. George briefly awakes, believing that he may have a cigarillo case on him that deflected the blow, but when he realises that he must have left the case at home, promptly falls dead again in Baldrick's arms.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his summer}} {{times when he}} was a teenager, he {{attended}} several drawing classes titled [...] "Center for Character Animation" [...] where he studied under famous cartoonist Brian Mitchell. Mitchell taught him most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> never got at school. He graduated from Catskill High School in 1997 and in the Art Institute of Philadelphia in 1999.|$|E

60|$|Haley, {{accustomed}} to strike <b>the</b> balance <b>of</b> probabilities between lies of {{greater or lesser}} magnitude, thought that it lay in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dirt road aforesaid. <b>The</b> mention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> thought he perceived was involuntary on Sam's part at first, and his confused attempts to dissuade him he set down to a desperate lying on second thoughts, as being unwilling to implicate Liza.|$|R
60|$|The situation, name, {{and history}} of Mrs. Fitzgerald were never {{mentioned}} by the Moseleys in public; but Jane, in <b>the</b> confidence <b>of</b> her affections, had told her lover who <b>the</b> inmate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cottage was. <b>The</b> idea <b>of</b> her being kept there by Denbigh immediately occurred to him, and although he was surprised at <b>the</b> audacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>he</b> was determined to profit by the occasion.|$|R
2500|$|Horne and King {{regarded}} {{each other}} with respect and mutual suspicion. Horne told a friend that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> could do for the Navy was to keep King under control, while King admired Horne's intelligence and administrative skill but distrusted his ambition. [...] "Horne was a [...] ", King mused later, [...] "but a very able man all the same... I have never liked him and never knew why." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 60 Minutes {{interview}} that aired during May 2000, Farrakhan stated that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> said {{may have led}} to the assassination of MalcolmX. [...] "I may have been complicit in words that I spoke", he said. [...] "I acknowledge that and regret that any word that I have said caused the loss of life of a human being." [...] A few days later Farrakhan denied that he [...] "ordered the assassination" [...] of MalcolmX, although he again acknowledged that he [...] "created the atmosphere that ultimately led to MalcolmX's assassination." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> left as his legacy, some of {{the most}} memorable and still robust are [...] {{completing}} the nationalization of hydroelectricity through Hydro-Québec, the Quebec Charter of the French Language, the political party financing law, and the Parti Québécois itself. His government was the first in Canada to prohibit {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation in the province's Charte des droits de la personne in 1977. He also continued the work of the Lesage government in improving social services, in which social needs were taken care of by the state, instead of the Catholic Church (as in the Duplessis era) or the individual. Lévesque is still regarded by many as a symbol of democracy and tolerance.|$|E
5000|$|Duterte's verbal attacks {{especially}} to the US and EU is viewed by many Filipinos {{as a threat to}} their jobs especially those working for foreign companies. Mark Williams, chief of Asia economist at Capital Economics said that [...] "Certainly, investors are worried by some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he's</b> saying, he's really unnerved people". The Philippine government, however, expects that employment, especially in BPO industries, will continue to keep on rising.|$|R
60|$|From what hath been said, it is {{manifest}} that God did never command us to believe, nor his {{ministers to}} preach, any doctrine which {{is contrary to}} the reason he hath pleased to endow us with; but for his own wise ends has thought fit to conceal from us <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> commands; thereby to try our faith and obedience, and increase our dependence upon him.|$|R
