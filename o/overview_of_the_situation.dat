40|$|In {{recent years}} {{considerable}} portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> computer science community has focused its attention on understanding living cell biochemistry {{and efforts to}} understand such complication reaction environment have spread over wide front, ranging from systems biology approaches, through network analysis (motif identification) towards developing language and simulators for low level biochemical processes. Apart from simulation work, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> efforts are directed to using mean field equations (equivalent to <b>the</b> equations <b>of</b> classical chemical kinetics) to address various problems (stability, robustness, sensitivity analysis, etc.).

40|$|Lagged {{variables}} play {{an important}} role in cross-sectional models in geography and regional sciences. This paper starts with an <b>overview</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> in which they may be required. Lagged variables also pose serious problems from a statistical point of view: multicollinearity and <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lag. Some common approaches to these two problems are discussed and evaluated. As an alternative a linear structural equation approach is presented, where the lagged variables are compressed to latent variables in a measurement model. The relationship between the lagged variables, thus compressed, and the dependent variable is expressed in the structural model. Both the measurement model and the structural model are estimated simultaneously. The paper ends with an application. A model of urban immigration for the thirty-three largest Dutch cities is estimated. ...|$|R

50|$|Initially, BoB mostly {{remained}} an online group with sporadic, closely guarded, offline social events for its selected members, staying {{devoid of any}} political edge. It was not until May 2005 when it attempted to assert itself politically by sending a letter to The Daily Star newspaper, regarding the first International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia. The letter, which presented a brief <b>overview</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> of gay community in Bangladesh and highlighted its main problems, met mostly with negative response, caused BoB to decide to stay apolitical. Around the same time, a safe sex campaign was initiated, offering HIV testings at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research in Dhaka, and Boys of Bangladesh knotted co-operation with a Bangladeshi human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) for a survey on sexual diversity. The number of group members had significantly grown by 2006, however, {{the state of emergency}} introduced in the country stopped BoB from organising any events for some period of time.|$|E

50|$|Scholars such as Bernard Faure and Miranda Shaw are in {{agreement}} that Buddhist studies is in its infancy in terms of addressing gender issues.

Two articles have seriously broached the subject of women in Indian tantric Buddhism, while somewhat more attention has been paid to Tibetan nuns and lay yoginis.However Khandro Rinpoche, a female lama in Tibetan Buddhism, downplays the significance of growing attention to the topic:When there is a talk about women and Buddhism, I have noticed that people often regard the topic as something new and different. They believe that women in Buddhism has become an important topic because we live in modern times and so many women are practicing the Dharma now. However, this is not the case. The female sangha has been here for centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition. The roots are there, and we are simply re-energizing them.|$|E
5000|$|Joseph Forbes {{comments}} that: [...] "The complex, conflict-filled {{interaction between}} Rommel and his superiors over logistics, objectives and priorities {{should not be}} used to detract from Rommel's reputation as a remarkable military leader", because Rommel was not given powers over logistics, and because if only generals who attain strategic-policy goals are great generals, such highly regarded commanders as Robert E. Lee, Hannibal, Charles XII would have to be excluded from that list. General Siegfried F. Storbeck, Deputy Inspector General of the Bundeswehr (1987-1991), remarks that, Rommel's leadership style and offensive thinking, although carrying inherent risks like losing the <b>overview</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> and creating overlapping of authority, have been proved effective, and have been analysed and incorporated in the training of officers by [...] "us, our Western allies, the Warsaw Pact, and even the Israel Defense Forces." [...] Maurice Remy and Samuel Mitcham both defend his strategic decision regarding Malta as, although risky, the only logical choice. Mitcham also takes note {{of the fact that the}} British C-in-C actually feared that the German leadership would embark on Rommel's strategic plans regarding the Suez Canal instead of that of Hitler.|$|E
5000|$|The initial aim of {{counselling}} {{and support}} is therefore {{to create a}} protected space for parents and the newborn, so as to facilitate a close bond. In addition, the parents need to be enabled to take the necessary decisions on the child's behalf calmly and after due reflection. In this process, {{they should not be}} subjected to time or social pressures. Parents' rapid requests for medical advice or for corrective surgery are often a result of initial feelings of helplessness, which need to be overcome so as to permit carefully considered decision-making.It is important to bear in mind and also to point out to the parents that a diagnosis does not in itself entail any treatment or other medical measures, but serves initially to provide an <b>overview</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> and a basis for subsequent decisions, which may also take the form of watchful waiting....interventions have lasting effects on the development of identity, fertility, sexual functioning and the parent-child relationship. The parents' decisions should therefore be marked by authenticity, clarity and full awareness, and based on love for the child, so that they can subsequently be openly justified vis-à-vis the child or young adult.|$|E
