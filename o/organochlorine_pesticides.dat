5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon became {{an endangered species}} primarily due {{to the use of}} <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides,</b> especially DDT, the breakdown of which lowered estrogen levels in the bloodstream of female {{peregrine falcon}}s and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to grow thinner by up to 20 percent. Since peregrine falcons lay their eggs on rocky ledges rather than nests, the thinned shells break under the stress of both the rocky ledge and the weight of the parents during incubation. Following 1970, recovery efforts for the peregrine falcon population have been successful. The agricultural use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1972, and recovery teams in the eastern United States were successful in breeding and training peregrines in captivity to later release to the wild, a procedure called hacking. In 1999, the peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E
5|$|Because it is {{a common}} estuarine fish, it has been used in studies of heavy metal {{contamination}} in coastal waters. Fish tested around Sydney showed uptake was highest in the gonads, then muscle, gills and liver. It is unclear why metal concentrations were lower in toadfish livers (compared with studies of contamination in other fish) but their liver cells may be more effective at removing these elements. Lead, cadmium and nickel levels corresponded with those in the sediment from which the fish were taken, suggesting dietary intake. The gonads of male fish had twenty times as much arsenic as those of females, while the gills of female fish contained thirty times as much lead as those of males. Raised levels of arsenic, cobalt, cadmium and lead in gills suggested the fish absorbed these from the surrounding water. An experiment exposing smooth toadfish to radioactive cadmium and selenium in either food or water found that cadmium in food was taken up in and excreted by the liver, while cadmium in water was taken up in the gut lining and excreted in liver, gills and kidney, indicating the fish were consuming a lot of water. Selenium was taken up in the gills, kidneys and liver regardless of whether it was in food or water.Cd and 75Se from Water and Food by an Estuarine Fish (Tetractenos glaber) | journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity| doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.07.012| pmid=17884259}} Fieldwork in Sydney waterways showed that higher arsenic, lead, cadmium and cobalt corresponded with decreased lipid levels in liver and gonadal tissue, and raised cobalt and nickel correspond to increased protein levels in muscle, liver and gonadal tissue. Raised lead levels were consistent with smaller egg size. A study of asymmetry of fish bones in smooth toadfish in various parts of Sydney and Hawkesbury River estuaries showed a relationship between exposure to <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> but not heavy metals, indicating the finding may correlate to stress from organic toxicity.|$|E
25|$|In general, a {{pesticide}} is {{a chemical}} or biological agent (such as a virus, bacterium, antimicrobial, or disinfectant) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests. Target pests can include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, molluscs, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy property, cause nuisance, or spread disease, or are disease vectors. Although pesticides have benefits, some also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other species.

The main way of human exposure to the OCP contamination is through food, especially the food products of animal origin. The aims of this study were to determine the presence and concentration of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticide</b> residues in milk and dairy products samples collected from Bacau district area and to assess human exposure to OCPs through the consumption of these products. A total number of 54 samples of milk and dairy products were analysed for their residual content of hexaclorocyclohexane isomers (HCHs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its analogues. The levels of OCP residues were determined by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method. The results indicated that all the analysed samples were contaminated with alpha-HCH, beta-HCH and gamma-HCH, respectively. In all the analysed samples, DDT and its analogues were non-detectable. The presence of gamma-HCH (Lindane) was detected in the range of 0. 0042 to 0. 2124 (mg kg(- 1) fat) for raw cow milk, of 0. 0028 to 0. 1408 (mg kg(- 1) fat) for pasteurised cow milk and of 0. 0042 to 0. 2682 (mg kg(- 1) fat) for sour cream.

The generation of ROS results in DNA double-strand breaks either directly or in a replication-dependent manner, both in mice and human cells. Importantly, ES-induced DNA damage evokes DNA damage response, resulting in elevated levels of classical non-homologous DNA endjoining (NHEJ), the predominant double-strand break repair pathway in higher eukaryotes. Sequence analyses of NHEJ junctions revealed that ES treatment results in extensive processing of broken DNA, culminating in increased and long junctional deletions, thereby favoring erroneous repair. We also find that exposure to ES leads to significant increase in microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), a LIGASE III-dependent alternative repair pathway. Therefore, we demonstrate that ES induces DNA damage and genomic instability, alters DNA damage response thereby promoting erroneous DNA repair...|$|R
