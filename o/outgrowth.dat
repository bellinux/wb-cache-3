(i) Tissue- fragment explants from NLAL {{areas of the}} gland produced abnormal lobuloalveolar (LA) <b>outgrowths</b> in 3 of 10 fat pads. (ii) Transplantation of dissociated cells of NLAL-derived LA <b>outgrowths</b> into 36 fat pads showed 100 % LA <b>outgrowths</b> and 3 (8 %) of these 36 <b>outgrowths</b> produced mammary carcinomas. (iii) The explants of dissociated cells from whole mammary glands treated with DMBA in culture produced full or partial LA structures in 2 of 56 <b>outgrowths.</b> (iv) The explants of dissociated cells prepared from <b>outgrowths</b> derived from explants as in iii produced 9 LA <b>outgrowths</b> in 16 instances; mammary tumor incidence in these <b>outgrowths</b> was 3 of 16 (18 %). (v) The explants of tissue fragments from LA <b>outgrowths</b> as in iv produced LA <b>outgrowths</b> in 20 of 20 fat pads; mammary carcinomas appeared in 16 of 20 (80 %) of these <b>outgrowths.</b> No NLAL was detectable in control glands treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (solvent for DMBA); explants of the control glands consistently produced ductal <b>outgrowths</b> and no tumor.

40|$|NGC 4921 and 7049 are two spiral galaxies {{presenting}} narrow, distinct dust features. A {{detailed study}} of the morphology of those features {{has been carried out}} using Hubble Space Telescope archival images. NGC 4921 shows a few but well-defined dust arms midway to its centre while NGC 7049 displays many more dusty features, mainly collected within a ring-shaped formation. Numerous dark and filamentary structures, called <b>outgrowths,</b> are found to protrude from the dusty arms in both galaxies. The <b>outgrowths</b> point both outwards and inwards in the galaxies. Mostly they are found to be V-shaped or Y-shaped with the branches connected to dark arm filaments. Often the stem of the Y appears to consist of intertwined filaments. Remarkably, the <b>outgrowths</b> show considerable similarities to elephant trunks in H II regions. A model of the <b>outgrowths,</b> based on magnetized filaments, is proposed. The model provides explanations of both the shapes and orientations of the <b>outgrowths.</b> Most important, it can also give an account for their intertwined structures. It is found that the longest <b>outgrowths</b> are confusingly similar to dusty spiral arms. This suggests that some of the <b>outgrowths</b> can develop into such arms. The time-scale of the development is estimated to be on the order of the rotation period of the arms or shorter. Similar processes may also take place in other spiral galaxies. If so, the model of the <b>outgrowths</b> can offer a new approach to the old winding problem of spiral arms. Comment: 35 pages, 16 figure...|$|R

Materials and methods: In total, 162 twins (81 twin pairs) were analyzed for the presence or absence, type, and size of oral bony <b>outgrowths.</b> Statistical analysis was carried out to find the prevalence of bony protuberances and the relationship between zygosity and occurrence of oral bony enlargements. Zygosity of twins was confirmed by DNA analysis. Results: 59. 9 % of the subjects had oral bony <b>outgrowths.</b> Mandibular tori were found in 56. 8 % and palatal tori in 1. 8 % of the sample. Palatal exostoses and mandibular exostoses were present in 1. 8 % and 3. 1 % of the sample, respectively, whereas maxillary exostoses were not found. A higher percentage of tori and exostoses were found in the group of older subjects (> 18 years old, p = 0. 025). No significant difference was found between men and women in the prevalence of bony <b>outgrowths.</b> High k and r values (0. 91 0. 062) showed very good concor- dance of oral bony <b>outgrowths</b> between monozygotic and moderate concordance (0. 58 0. 141) between dizygotic co-twins (p < 0. 001).

To model dormant breast cancer in vivo, we employed a transgenic mouse model in which Wnt 1 -initiated mammary cancer is doxycycline dependent. After regression of Wnt-dependent cancers, subclinical disease lesions were propagated in vivo using classical tissue recombination techniques. Surprisingly, <b>outgrowths</b> derived from dormant malignant tissue reconstituted morphologically normal ductal trees in wild-type mammary fat pads. Whereas hyperplasia-derived <b>outgrowths</b> remained benign, <b>outgrowths</b> derived from dormant malignancy underwent a morphological transition suggesting single-step transformation following reactivation of Wnt signaling and rapidly yielded invasive mammary tumors. Remarkably, <b>outgrowths</b> derived from dormant malignancy could be serially propagated in vivo and retained the potential to undergo lobuloalveolar differentiation in response to hormones of pregnancy. Matching somatic H-Ras mutations shared by antecedent tumors and descendant mammary ductal <b>outgrowths</b> confirmed their clonal relatedness. Thus, propagation of epithelium that possesses a latent malignant growth program reveals impressive regenerative and developmental potential, supporting the notion that dormant mammary cancers harbor transformed mammary progenitor cells.
