5|$|The {{simplest}} form of {{an organic}} molecule is the hydrocarbon—a large family of <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> that are composed of hydrogen atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms. Chain length, side chains and functional groups all affect the properties of <b>organic</b> <b>molecules.</b>|$|E

Once the prey is digested, the stomach reopens, allowing the elimination of waste products {{and the beginning of}} the next hunting cycle.

5|$|Catabolism is {{the set of}} {{metabolic}} {{processes that}} break down large molecules. These include breaking down and oxidizing food molecules. The purpose of the catabolic reactions is to provide the energy and components needed by anabolic reactions which build molecules. The exact nature of these catabolic reactions differ from organism to organism, and organisms can be classified based on their sources of energy and carbon (their primary nutritional groups), {{as shown in the}} table below. <b>Organic</b> <b>molecules</b> are used as a source of energy by organotrophs, while lithotrophs use inorganic substrates, and phototrophs capture sunlight as chemical energy. However, all these different forms of metabolism depend on redox reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor molecules such as <b>organic</b> <b>molecules,</b> water, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide or ferrous ions to acceptor molecules such as oxygen, nitrate or sulfate. In animals, these reactions involve complex <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> that are broken down to simpler molecules, such as carbon dioxide and water. In photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and cyanobacteria, these electron-transfer reactions do not release energy but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Chauvin {{achieved}} a breakthrough when {{he described the}} mechanism by which a metal atom bound to a carbon atom in one group of atoms causes the group to shift places {{with a group of}} atoms in another molecule and explained metathesis in detail. He showed that the reaction involves two double bonds. One of the double bonds connects two parts of an <b>organic</b> <b>molecule.</b> The other double bond connects a metal-based catalyst to a fragment of an <b>organic</b> <b>molecule.</b> In metathesis, these two double bonds combine and split to make four single bonds. The single bonds form a ring that connects the metal catalyst, the organic fragment, and the two parts of the <b>organic</b> <b>molecule.</b> The metal catalyst then breaks off from the ring, carrying away part of the <b>organic</b> <b>molecule.</b> This process leaves the fragment attached to the remainder of the <b>organic</b> <b>molecule</b> with a double bond, forming a new organic compound. Scholars have compared this reaction to a dance in which two sets of partners join hands to form a ring and then split apart again to form two new partnerships.|$|R

5|$|A model {{suggests}} that Enceladus's salty ocean (-Na, -Cl, -CO3) has an alkaline pH of 11 to 12. The high pH is interpreted to be {{a consequence of}} serpentinization of chondritic rock {{that leads to the}} generation of H2, a geochemical source of energy that can support both abiotic and biological synthesis of <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> such as those that have been detected in Enceladus's plumes.|$|E
5|$|A {{planet that}} can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not {{originate}} there. Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism. The distance of Earth from the Sun, {{as well as}} its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.|$|E
5|$|Cassini has {{provided}} {{strong evidence that}} Enceladus has an ocean with an energy source, nutrients and <b>organic</b> <b>molecules,</b> making Enceladus {{one of the best}} places for the study of potentially habitable environments for extraterrestrial life. By contrast, the water thought to be on Jupiter's moon Europa is located under a much thicker layer of ice.|$|E

5|$|Most solids {{used are}} {{engineering}} materials consisting of crystalline solids {{in which the}} atoms or ions are arranged in a repetitive geometric pattern which {{is known as a}} lattice structure. The only exception is material that is made from glass which is a combination of a supercooled liquid and polymers which are aggregates of large <b>organic</b> <b>molecules.</b>|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Podoserpula pusio grow on the ground, on well-rotted stumps, or among {{decaying}} tussock grass. They are {{presumed to be}} saprobic, and obtain nutrients by breaking down larger <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> found in the soil or in decaying wood. P.miranda in contrast, {{is thought to be}} ectomycorrhizal, as it appears to associate with Arillastrum gummiferum, the predominant canopy tree in the forests where it is found.|$|E
5|$|All {{living things}} on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid {{water as a}} solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane. Water is a {{stronger}} solvent than methane. Water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{and plants}} {{have evolved to}} {{synthesise}} {{a vast array of}} poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{originally}} {{supposed that}} the entire trans-Neptunian population would show a similar red surface colour, as they were thought to have originated in the same region and subjected to the same physical processes. Specifically, SDOs were expected to have large amounts of surface methane, chemically altered into complex <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> by energy from the Sun. This would absorb blue light, creating a reddish hue. Most classical objects display this colour, but scattered objects do not; instead, they present a white or greyish appearance.|$|E

Complex DNA and RNA organic {{compounds}} of life, including uracil, cytosine, and thymine, have also been formed in the laboratory under conditions mimicking those found in outer space, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar cosmic dust and gas clouds.|$|E

5|$|In {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, {{the electrons}} removed from <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> {{in areas such}} as the protagon acid cycle are transferred to oxygen and the energy released is used to make ATP. This is done in eukaryotes by a series of proteins in the membranes of mitochondria called the electron transport chain. In prokaryotes, these proteins are found in the cell's inner membrane. These proteins use the energy released from passing electrons from reduced molecules like NADH onto oxygen to pump protons across a membrane.|$|E
5|$|In {{the form}} of {{chloride}} ions, chlorine is necessary to all known species of life. Other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living organisms, and artificially produced chlorinated organics range from inert to toxic. In the upper atmosphere, chlorine-containing <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> such as chlorofluorocarbons have been implicated in ozone depletion. Small quantities of elemental chlorine are generated by oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite in neutrophils {{as part of the}} immune response against bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} can {{be divided}} into thermotropic, lyotropic and metallotropic phases. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of <b>organic</b> <b>molecules,</b> although a few minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a phase transition into the liquid-crystal phase as temperature is changed. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and concentration of the liquid-crystal molecules in a solvent (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules; their liquid-crystal transition depends not only on temperature and concentration, but also on the inorganic-organic composition ratio.|$|E

5|$|Organisms differ {{according}} {{to the number of}} constructed molecules in their cells. Autotrophs such as plants can construct the complex <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> in cells such as polysaccharides and proteins from simple molecules like carbon dioxide and water. Heterotrophs, on the other hand, require a source of more complex substances, such as monosaccharides and amino acids, to produce these complex molecules. Organisms can be further classified by ultimate source of their energy: photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophs obtain energy from light, whereas chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs obtain energy from inorganic oxidation reactions.|$|E
5|$|Outer {{space is}} sparsely filled with several dozen types of <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> {{discovered}} to date by microwave spectroscopy, blackbody radiation {{left over from}} the big bang and the origin of the universe, and cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles. There is also some gas, plasma and dust, and small meteors. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this debris re-enters the atmosphere periodically.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} set of catabolic {{reactions}} in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first stage, large <b>organic</b> <b>molecules,</b> such as proteins, polysaccharides or lipids, are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to smaller molecules, usually acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on the CoA is oxidised to water and {{carbon dioxide in the}} citric acid cycle and electron transport chain, releasing the energy that is stored by reducing the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) into NADH.|$|E
