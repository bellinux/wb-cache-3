Schnyder Woods are in close relation with 3 -dimensional orthogonal surfaces and {{my work in}} this field is aimed at improving the understanding of this relation.

The {{theme of}} this article is the {{connection}} between the pro-unipotent fundamental group π 1 (X; <b>o)</b> of <b>a</b> <b>pointed</b> algebraic curve X, algebraic cycles, and special values of L-functions. The extension of mixed Hodge structures arising in the second stage in the lower central series of π 1 (X; o) gives rise to a supply of complex points on the Jacobian Jac(X) of X indexed by Hodge cycles on X × X. The main results of this note relate these points to the Abel-Jacobi image of Gross-Kudla-Schoen’s modified diagonal in X 3, and express this Abel-Jacobi image in terms of iterated integrals. The resulting formula is the basis for the practical complex-analytic calculations of these points when X is a modular (or Shimura) curve, a setting where the recent work [YZZ] of X. Yuan, S.
