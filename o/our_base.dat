25|$|Babylonian {{mathematics}} (also {{known as}} Assyro-Babylonian mathematics) was any mathematics developed or {{practiced by the}} people of Mesopotamia, from the days of the early Sumerians to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC. Babylonian mathematical texts are plentiful and well edited. The Babylonians were able to make great advances in mathematics for two reasons. Firstly, the number 60 is a superior highly composite number, having factors of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60 (including those that are themselves composite), facilitating calculations with fractions. Additionally, unlike the Egyptians and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values (much as, in <b>our</b> <b>base</b> ten system, 734 = 7×100 + 3×10 + 4×1).|$|E

They're exactly wrong. There had been no reelected Republican majority since 1928. Part of the reason we got reelected... is <b>our</b> <b>base</b> thought we were serious. And they thought we were serious because when it came to a show-down, we didn't flinch." [...] In a 2011 op-ed in The Washington Post, Gingrich said that the government shutdown led to the balanced-budget deal in 1997 and the first four consecutive balanced budgets since the 1920s, as well as the first re-election of a Republican majority since 1928.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study dual bases {{functions}} in subspaces. These are bases which are dual to functionals on larger linear space. Our goal is construct and derive properties of certain bases {{obtained from the}} construction, with primary focus on polynomial spaces in B-form. When they exist, <b>our</b> <b>bases</b> are always affine (not convex), and we define a symmetric configuration that converges to Lagrange polynomial bases. Because of affineness of <b>our</b> <b>bases,</b> {{we are able to}} derive certain approximation theoretic results involving quasi-interpolation and a Bernstein-type operator. In a broad sense, it is the aim of this paper to present a new way to view approximation problems in subspaces. In subsequent work, we will apply our results to dual bases in subspaces of spline and multivariate polynomial spaces, and apply this to the construction of blended function approximants used for approximation in the sum of certain tensor product spaces.

2500|$|China Everbright Group, the Henan Working Group and AirAsia Berhad have {{announced}} {{the signing of}} a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a low-cost carrier in China as a joint venture. AirAsia China will be based in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, where the new low-cost carrier also {{plans to build a}} dedicated low-cost carrier terminal, an aviation training academy and a MRO facility. AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes said, “We chose Zhengzhou as <b>our</b> <b>base</b> due to its strategic location and importance as a logistics hub. As China’s gateway to Europe, Zhengzhou sits at the centre of a vast rail, highway and air transport network that forms the linchpin of China’s development plans for its central and western regions. With President Xi Jinping’s vision for One Belt, One Road, Zhengzhou is set to become even more important, not least as the heart of low-cost air travel in North Asia." [...] China Everbright Group is a conglomerate focused on financial services and controlled by the state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council. Henan Working Group represents the Henan state government. AirAsia already operates joint ventures in India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand and is about to relaunch its activities in Japan. It also has recently announced plans for a JV in Vietnam. AirAsia Group already serves 15 destinations in China, but does not yet operate from/to Zhengzhou, where China Southern Airlines is the dominant carrier today controlling approximately 23% of weekly capacity according to the ch-aviation capacity module.|$|E
