5|$|A left-handed opening batsman, Morris {{played in}} all five Tests, partnering the {{right-handed}} Sid Barnes in three Tests; Barnes {{was injured in}} the Third and Fourth Tests.

In those matches, Australia fielded its first-choice team; Brown played out of position in the middle order, while Morris and Barnes opened.
