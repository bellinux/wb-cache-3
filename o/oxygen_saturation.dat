5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter. These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> level on a pulse oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{complications}} {{are associated}} with a bad prognosis. Examples are hypotension (low blood pressure), hypoxia (low blood <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation),</b> lower cerebral perfusion pressures and longer times spent with high intracranial pressures. Patient characteristics also influence prognosis. Factors thought to worsen it include abuse of substances such as illicit drugs and alcohol and age over sixty or under two years (in children, younger age at time of injury may be associated with a slower recovery of some abilities). Other influences that may affect recovery include pre-injury intellectual ability, coping strategies, personality traits, family environment, social support systems and financial circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{habitats}} include rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, {{marshes and}} bogs. Although some organisms are found across {{most of these}} habitats, the majority have more specific requirements. The water velocity, its temperature and <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> are important factors, but in river systems, there are fast and slow sections, pools, bayous and backwaters which provide a range of habitats. Similarly, aquatic plants can be floating, semi-submerged, submerged or grow in permanently or temporarily saturated soils besides bodies of water. Marginal plants provide important habitat for both invertebrates and vertebrates, and submerged plants provide oxygenation of the water, absorb nutrients and {{play a part in}} the reduction of pollution.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} oxygen present in {{seawater}} depends primarily upon its temperature and the photosynthetic organisms living in it, particularly algae, phytoplankton, and {{plants such as}} seagrass. During the day, their photosynthetic activity produces oxygen, which dissolves into the seawater and is used by marine animals. The water's <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> is lower during the night and much lower in the deep sea. Below a depth of about , there is insufficient light for photosynthesis and consequently little dissolved oxygen. Below this, anaerobic bacteria break down falling organic material, producing hydrogen sulfide (H₂S). It is projected that global warming will reduce oxygen both in surface and deep waters, due to oxygen's decreased solubility as temperatures increase and increased oceanic stratification.|$|E
5|$|The {{water quality}} of the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} is generally poor due to high temperatures, sedimentation, and <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> levels which occur throughout the region. Most of these problems are created by human activity; forests and riparian zones have been cleared {{to make way for}} agriculture, and high road densities cause slope failures. Hydraulic mining near Sterlingville devastated the surrounding landscape, leaving the slopes bare and sending rocks and gravel downstream. Cattle and sheep were introduced to the area in the late 19th century; they have since overgrazed some areas of the watershed, reducing native grasses and allowing noxious weeds to spread. Overgrazing also contributes to soil erosion. Large amounts of water is diverted from the river and its tributaries, sometimes {{to such an extent that}} the mouth is left nearly dry.|$|E
5|$|Intubation may be {{necessary}} for a patient with decreased oxygen content and <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> of the blood caused when their breathing is inadequate (hypoventilation), suspended (apnea), or when the lungs are unable to sufficiently transfer gasses to the blood. Such patients, who may be awake and alert, are typically critically ill with a multisystem disease or multiple severe injuries. Examples of such conditions include cervical spine injury, multiple rib fractures, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or near-drowning. Specifically, intubation is considered if the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is less than 60millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) while breathing an inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) of 50% or greater. In patients with elevated arterial carbon dioxide, an arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) greater than 45mm Hg {{in the setting of}} acidemia would prompt intubation, especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening respiratory acidosis. Regardless of the laboratory values, these guidelines are always interpreted in the clinical context.|$|E

40|$|Patients {{with acute}} leukaemia may have spuriously low {{arterial}} oxygen tensions (PaO 2). The markedly increased numbers of {{white blood cells}} in these patients rapidly consume dissolved plasma oxygen resulting in dramatically decreased PaO 2 and calculated <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturations.</b> The case history is reported of a patient with a white blood count of 191 000 /mm 3 in whom multiple arterial blood gas measurements documented hypoxaemia {{out of proportion to}} the clinical picture. Pulse oximetry was used to confirm higher haemoglobin <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturations</b> and to establish the spuriously low plasma oxygen tensions in this patient. ...|$|R
50|$|Supplemental oxygen is {{recommended}} {{in those with}} low oxygen levels at rest (a partial pressure of oxygen of less than 50-55 mmHg or <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturations</b> of less than 88%). In this group of people it decreases {{the risk of heart}} failure and death if used 15 hours per day and may improve people's ability to exercise. In those with normal or mildly low oxygen levels, oxygen supplementation may improve shortness of breath when given during exercise, but may not improve breathlessness during normal daily activities or impact the quality of life. There is a risk of fires and little benefit when those on oxygen continue to smoke. In this situation some recommend against its use. During acute exacerbations, many require oxygen therapy; the use of high concentrations of oxygen without taking into account a person's <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturations</b> may lead to increased levels of carbon dioxide and worsened outcomes. In those at high risk of high carbon dioxide levels, <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturations</b> of 88-92% are recommended, while for those without this risk recommended levels are 94-98%.|$|R

25|$|Those {{individuals}} {{with the lowest}} initial partial pressure of end-tidal pCO2 (the lowest concentration of carbon dioxide {{at the end of}} the respiratory cycle, a measure of a higher alveolar ventilation) and corresponding high <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> levels tend to have a lower incidence of acute mountain sickness than those with high end-tidal pCO2 and low <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> levels.|$|E

30|$|Thirty five {{successive}} {{patients with}} severe sepsis/septic shock in whom a CVC was inserted were {{the subject of}} this study.

25|$|The {{effects of}} high {{altitude}} on humans are considerable. The percentage <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> of hemoglobin determines {{the content of}} oxygen in blood. After the human body reaches around 2,100 m (7,000 feet) above sea level, the saturation of oxyhemoglobin begins to plummet.|$|E
25|$|In May 2007, the Caudwell Xtreme Everest {{undertook}} a medical study of oxygen levels in human blood at extreme altitude. Over 200 volunteers climbed to Everest Base Camp where various medical tests {{were performed to}} examine blood oxygen levels. A small team also performed tests {{on the way to}} the summit. Even at base camp, the low partial pressure of oxygen had direct effect on blood <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> levels. At sea level, blood <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> is generally 98–99%. At base camp, blood saturation fell to between 85 and 87%. Blood samples taken at the summit indicated very low oxygen levels in the blood. A side effect of low blood oxygen is a greatly increased breathing rate, often 80–90 breaths per minute as opposed to a more typical 20–30. Exhaustion can occur merely attempting to breathe.|$|E

25|$|For {{uncomplicated}} births, {{care can}} include suctioning of newborns airway, cord cutting, collection of afterbirth, obtaining an APGAR score, keeping the newborn warm, and monitoring of vital signs such as respiratory rate and effort, pulse, blood pressure(rarely taken on newborns in the pre-hospital setting) <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation,</b> blood sugar, and EKG monitoring.|$|E
25|$|The complex {{nature of}} cardiothoracic surgery necessitates extra {{training}} {{to acquire the}} skills needed to be a cardiothoracic anesthesiology consultant. Fellows are trained to achieve expertise in the advanced monitoring techniques including invasive blood pressure, arterial blood gas analysis, cardiac output monitoring, jugular venous <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation,</b> cerebral oximetry, Bispectral Index (BIS), Transcranial doppler (TCD), and Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).|$|E
25|$|One further {{development}} {{in recent years}} has been the invention of a catheter with a fiber-optic based probe which is extended and lodged into the ventricle wall providing instant readings of SvO2 or <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> of the ventricle tissues. This technique has a finite life as the sensor becomes coated with protein and it can irritate the ventricle via the contact area.|$|E
40|$|Sulfhemoglobinemia {{is a rare}} {{condition}} in which a sulfur atom oxidizes the heme moiety in hemoglobin, making the hemoglobin incapable of carrying oxygen and leading to hypoxia and cyanosis. This condition has been described in patients taking sulfur medications or who have cultured hydrogen sulfide producing intestinal bacteria such as Morganella morganii. This case describes a pediatric patient who {{was found to have}} cyanosis on two occasions of urinary tract infection in the setting of chronic constipation, with confirmed sulfhemoglobinemia during the second admission. Sulfhemoglobinemia due to increases in sulfur producing intestinal bacteria led to cyanosis and low <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturations.</b> The patient had an incidental finding of a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM) but had a normal PAO 2 so was not hypoxemic though she was cyanotic. Low <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturations</b> by pulse oximetry may be explained by dyshemoglobinemia as opposed to true arterial hypoxemia; the importance of measuring an arterial blood gas in cases of cyanosis is paramount...|$|R

5000|$|White in 1999 {{proposed}} a [...] "fast-track criteria" [...] {{to determine if}} patients can be transferred straight from theatre to Phase II recovery.

This does not include bleeding or urine output. This was used by Song et al. 2004.|$|R
25|$|Patients {{under general}} {{anesthesia}} must undergo continuous physiological monitoring to ensure safety. In the US, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) have established minimum monitoring guidelines for patients receiving general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or sedation. This includes electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, inspired and expired gases, <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> {{of the blood}} (pulse oximetry), and temperature. In the UK the Association of Anaesthetists (AAGBI) have set minimum monitoring guidelines for general and regional anesthesia. For minor surgery, this generally includes monitoring of heart rate, <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation,</b> blood pressure, and inspired and expired concentrations for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and inhalational anesthetic agents. For more invasive surgery, monitoring may also include temperature, urine output, blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, cardiac output, cerebral activity, and neuromuscular function. In addition, the operating room environment must be monitored for ambient temperature and humidity, {{as well as for}} accumulation of exhaled inhalational anesthetic agents, which might be deleterious to the health of operating room personnel.|$|E
25|$|At high altitude, , {{the onset}} of {{physiological}} effects of diminished inspiratory oxygen pressure (PiO2) includes decreased exercise performance and increased ventilation (lower arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide- PCO2). While arterial oxygen transport may be only slightly impaired the arterial <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation,</b> SaO2, generally stays above 90%. Altitude sickness is common between 2,400 and 4,000m {{because of the large}} number of people who ascend rapidly to these altitudes.|$|E
25|$|High {{concentrations}} of oxygen can cause oxygen toxicity such as lung damage or result in respiratory failure {{in those who}} are predisposed. It can also dry out the nose and {{increase the risk of}} fires in those who smoke. The target <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturation</b> recommended depends on the condition being treated. In most conditions a saturation of 94-98% is recommended, while in those at risk of carbon dioxide retention saturations of 88-92% are preferred, and in those with carbon monoxide toxicity or cardiac arrest they should be as high as possible. Air is typically 21% oxygen by volume. Oxygen is required by people for proper cell metabolism.|$|E

Irregularities in the heart beat and abnormal lowering of the blood pressure may be observed.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{assess the}} {{medium-term}} results of total cavopulmonary shunt operations {{in children with}} left atrial isomerism, interrupted inferior vena cava, and complex congenital heart defects. BACKGROUND [...] Creation of a total cavopulmonary shunt provides very good interim palliation for children with interrupted inferior vena cava and complex congenital heart disease; however, longer term results after this operation have not been reported. METHODS [...] Detailed follow up of six children who underwent creation of a total cavopulmonary shunt at a tertiary referral centre. RESULTS [...] There were no early or late deaths. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>saturations</b> at discharge ranged from 89 % to 92 % (mean 90 %). At last follow up (mean 4. 7 years) saturations at rest ranged from 73 % to 81 % (mean 77 %) (P < 0. 05). All patients underwent exercise stress testing. At peak exercise <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturations</b> ranged from 62 % to 87 % (mean 71. 5 %) and during recovery from 68 % to 85 % (mean 78 %). Cardiac catheterisation was performed in five patients with saturations of less than 80 % at rest or peak exercise. No patient had pulmonary arteriovenous fistula. Systemic venous to hepatic venous collaterals were documented in four patients. These were localised below the diaphragm in three and above the diaphragm in one patient. The collateral vessel was successfully embolised in three of these patients, with a rise in resting <b>oxygen</b> <b>saturations</b> from 6 to 10 % (mean 7 %). CONCLUSIONS [...] The development of systemic venous to hepatic venous collaterals is a common complication in patients who undergo a total cavopulmonary shunt operation. This can lead to significant desaturation at rest and during exercise. Detailed angiographic studies of the infradiaphragmatic system veins is required for diagnosis. Transcatheter embolisation of such vessels gives good relief...|$|R
