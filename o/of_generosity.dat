5|$|Although {{the most}} {{powerful}} individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with {{the concerns of the}} plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means <b>of</b> <b>generosity</b> and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.|$|E

25|$|Total depravity {{does not}} mean, however, {{that people are}} as evil as possible.

Thus, even acts <b>of</b> <b>generosity</b> and altruism are in fact egoist acts in disguise. All good, consequently, is derived from God alone, and in no way through man.|$|E

25|$|While the Sandinistas {{encouraged}} grassroots pluralism, {{they were}} perhaps less enthusiastic about national elections. They argued that popular support was {{expressed in the}} insurrection and that further appeals to popular support {{would be a waste}} of scarce resources. International pressure and domestic opposition eventually pressed the government toward a national election. Tomás Borge warned that the elections were a concession, an act <b>of</b> <b>generosity</b> and of political necessity. On the other hand, the Sandinistas had little to fear from the election given the advantages of incumbency and the restrictions on the opposition, and they hoped to discredit the armed efforts to overthrow them.|$|E
25|$|The second niche has {{a statue}} of St Agnes, by Vincenzo Felici. The bust {{on the left is}} a {{portrait}} of Baldassare Peruzzi, derived from a plaster portrait by Giovanni Duprè. The tomb of King Umberto I and his wife Margherita di Savoia is in the next chapel. The chapel was originally dedicated to St Michael the Archangel, and then to St. Thomas the Apostle. The present design is by Giuseppe Sacconi, completed after his death by his pupil Guido Cirilli. The tomb consists of a slab of alabaster mounted in gilded bronze. The frieze has allegorical representations <b>of</b> <b>Generosity,</b> by Eugenio Maccagnani, and Munificence, by Arnaldo Zocchi. The royal tombs are maintained by the National Institute of Honour Guards to the Royal Tombs, founded in 1878. They also organize picket guards at the tombs.

25|$|The {{church has}} one central nave. Similar to the Church of the Gesù in Rome, the narrow side aisles are turned into {{interconnecting}} chapels. There are four chapels: Women's or Queens', Saint Augustine's, Saint Ursula's, and Soldiers' or Knights'. The Queens' chapel was originally dedicated to Saint Petronilla, traditionally identified as daughter of Saint Peter. The chapel has four figures representing women's virtues: piety, generosity, purity, and assiduousness. The figure <b>of</b> <b>generosity</b> presents a stark social contrast between a wealthy lady and a pauper. Some art historians attempted to associate these figures with Queens of Poland. Painting of Saint Monica, mother of Saint Augustine, {{hangs in the}} chapel. The ceiling has scenes of executions and torture of early Christian martyrs, including Saint Fausta and Saint Theodora. The Knights' chapel has four figures of soldiers who became early Christian martyrs, including Saint Martinian, who helped Saint Peter to escape prison, and Saint Florian. The chapel also has a scene of Saint Casimir miraculously helping Lithuanians in the Siege of Polotsk and Saint Wenceslaus fighting with his brother Boleslaus the Cruel. This chapel clearly reflects Pac's interests: he dedicated {{most of his life}} to military and thought of himself as a knight. The chapel of Saint Ursula has more figures of early martyrs (Saint Apollonia, Saint Barbara, and Saint Catherine of Alexandria) that emphasize purity. The chapel of Saint Augustine emphasizes his teachings on Holy Trinity as undivided unity.|$|E

The Queen had a relatively balanced view of the conflict, and condemned atrocities on both sides. She wrote of [...] "her feelings of horror and regret at {{the result of this}} bloody civil war", and insisted, urged on by Albert, that an official proclamation announcing the transfer of power from the company to the state [...] "should breathe feelings <b>of</b> <b>generosity,</b> benevolence and religious toleration".

500|$|Nevertheless, {{some critics}} were less appreciative; John Wirt, in The Advocate, praised the album's {{sense of humor}} and [...] "delicious" [...] irreverence but noted that [...] " [...] musicianship in Motorcade <b>of</b> <b>Generosity</b> {{suggests}} the Cake guys are mediocre players". Mindy LaBernz, in The Austin Chronicle, described the album as [...] "cover-free, and, since we're on the subject, genre-free. A quartet made five by a trumpet player, Cake carry themselves with the snittiness of technically proficient, lyrically aware music lovers, who are almost anachronistically untrendy and brazenly proud of it". The signing to Capricorn and re-release of Motorcade led to both French and Nelson leaving the band, citing their dislike of [...] "the prospect of extensive national touring"; they were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani respectively.|$|E
500|$|Cake {{was formed}} in 1991 by McCrea, DiFiore, Greg Brown, Frank French and Shon Meckfessel, who soon left and was {{replaced}} by Nelson. Following the self-release of its debut album, Motorcade <b>of</b> <b>Generosity,</b> the band was signed to Capricorn Records in 1995 and released its first single, [...] "Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle", which hit number35 on the Modern Rock Tracks music chart and was featured on MTV's 120 Minutes; French and Nelson then left the band, and were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani. Cake's second album, 1996's Fashion Nugget, went platinum on the strength of its lead single, [...] "The Distance". Following a tour of Europe and the United States, both Brown and Damiani announced they were leaving Cake, which led to speculation about the band's future; McCrea eventually recruited Xan McCurdy to take over on guitar, and persuaded Nelson to return.|$|E
500|$|Of all the {{treatments}} {{of the story}} of Troilus and, especially, Cressida in the period between Chaucer and Shakespeare, it is Robert Henryson's that receives the most attention from modern critics. His poem The Testament of Cresseid is described by the Middle English expert C. David Benson as the [...] "only fifteenth century poem written in Great Britain that begins to rival the moral and artistic complexity of Chaucer's Troilus". [...] In the Testament the title-character is abandoned by Diomedes and then afflicted with leprosy so that she becomes unrecognizable to Troilus. He pities the lepers she is with and is generous to her because she reminds him of the idol of her in his mind, but he remains the virtuous pagan knight and does not achieve the redemption that she does. Even so, following Henryson Troilus was seen as a representation <b>of</b> <b>generosity.</b>|$|E
