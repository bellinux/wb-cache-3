[...] Swedish athletes Emma Green Tregaro and Moa Hjelmer painted her fingernails in rainbow colors as a symbolic protest. However, Tregaro was forced to re-paint them after they were deemed a political gesture that violated {{the rules of the}} IAAF. In response, she re-painted them red as a symbol of love. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbaeva criticized Tregaro's gesture as being disrespectful to the host country, stating in a press conference that [...] "we have <b>our</b> <b>law</b> which everyone has to respect. When we go to different countries, we try to follow their rules. We are not trying to set our rules over there. We are just trying to be respectful."

2500|$|Following {{the passage}} of Arizona's Support <b>Our</b> <b>Law</b> Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act in April 2010, which authorizes police {{officials}} to question persons on their immigration status if there is reasonable suspicion that they are illegally in the country or committing other violations not related to their immigration status, numerous polls showed widespread support for the law.

Finally, our results show that operational analysis—an approach to performance analysis traditionally associated with commercial transaction processing systems—usefully complements existing parallel performance analysis techniques...|$|R

And if somebody’s gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody else any harm, then perhaps there are other things that our cops should be looking at to engage in and try to clean up some of the other problems that we have in society that are appropriate for law enforcement to do and not concentrate on such a, relatively speaking, minimal problem that we have in the country." ...|$|E
