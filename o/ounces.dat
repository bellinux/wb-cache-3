5|$|In 18th century France, {{there was}} a {{national}} weight standard, the marc de Paris of 8 <b>ounces.</b> The civil pound of 16 <b>ounces</b> was equivalent to 2 marks, {{and it was also}} used as the apothecaries' pound. With 30.6g, the <b>ounces</b> were considerably heavier than other apothecaries' <b>ounces</b> in Romance countries, but otherwise the French system was not remarkable. Its history and connections to the English and Flemish standards are discussed below under Weight standards named after Troyes.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic form}} of the apothecaries' system is {{essentially}} {{a subset of the}} Roman weight system. An apothecaries' pound normally consisted of 12 <b>ounces.</b> (In France this was changed to 16 <b>ounces,</b> and in Spain the customary unit was the marco, a mark of 8 <b>ounces.)</b> In the south of Europe and in France, the scruple was generally divided into 24 grains, so that one ounce consisted of 576 grains. Nevertheless, the subdivision of an ounce was somewhat more uniform than that of a pound, and a common feature of all variants is that 12 <b>ounces</b> are roughly 100 drachms (96–128 drachms) and a grain is roughly the weight of a physical grain.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the modern}} (English, American and Imperial) troy <b>ounces</b> are roughly 1.5% {{heavier than the}} late Paris ounce, the exact {{historical}} relations between the original marc de Troyes, the French poids de marc, the Flemish trooisch pond and the English troy pound are unclear. It is known, however, that the numerical relation between the English and French troy <b>ounces</b> was exactly 64:63 in the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, hard-rock mining {{wound up}} {{becoming}} {{the single largest}} source of gold produced in the Gold Country. The total production of gold in California from then till now is estimated at 118 million <b>ounces</b> (3700 t).|$|E
5|$|It is most {{convenient}} {{to compare the}} various local weight standards by the metric weights of their <b>ounces.</b> The actual mass of an ounce varied by ±17% (5g) around the typical value of 30g. The table only shows approximate values for the most important standards; even the same nominal standard could vary slightly between one city and its neighbour. The range from 25g to 31g is filled with numerous variants, especially the Italian range up to 28g. But there is a relatively large gap between the troy <b>ounces</b> of 31g and the Habsburg ounce of 35g. The latter {{is the product of}} an 18th-century weight reform.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were also}} two {{varieties}} of refiners' carats once {{used in the}} United Kingdom — the pound carat and the <b>ounce</b> carat. The pound troy was divisible into 24 pound carats of 240 grains troy each; the pound carat was divisible into four pound grains of 60 grains troy each; and the pound grain was divisible into four pound quarters of 15 grains troy each. Likewise, the <b>ounce</b> troy was divisible into 24 <b>ounce</b> carats of 20 grains troy each; the <b>ounce</b> carat was divisible into four <b>ounce</b> grains of 5 grains troy each; and the <b>ounce</b> grain was divisible into four <b>ounce</b> quarters of [...] grains troy each.|$|R

5000|$|Interest {{in silver}} mining {{increased}} {{in recent years}} because of an increased price for the metal: the average silver price increased from $4.39 per troy <b>ounce</b> for the year 2001, to $13.45 per troy <b>ounce</b> for 2007. In 2011, silver prices rose to almost $49 per troy <b>ounce</b> in April before dropping to around $34 per troy <b>ounce</b> in late June. In March 2016, the silver price was around $15 per troy <b>ounce.</b>|$|R

5|$|Silkies are {{considered}} a bantam breed in some countries, but this varies according to region and many breed standards class them officially as large fowl; the bantam Silkie is actually a separate variety most of the time. Almost all North American strains of the breed are bantam-sized, but in Europe the standard-sized is the original version. However, even standard Silkies are relatively small chickens, with the males weighing only four pounds (1.8kg), and females weighing three pounds (1.36kg). The American Standard of Perfection calls for males that are 36 <b>ounces</b> (1kg), and females that are 32 <b>ounces</b> (910grams).|$|E
5|$|The apothecaries' system {{often used}} the same <b>ounces</b> as the {{precious}} metals system, although even then the number of <b>ounces</b> in a pound could be different. The apothecaries' pound was divided into its own special units, which were inherited (via influential treatises of Greek physicians such as Dioscorides and Galen, 1st and 2nd century) from the general-purpose weight system of the Romans. Where the apothecaries' weights and the normal commercial weights were different, {{it was not always}} clear which of the two systems was used in trade between merchants and apothecaries, or by which system apothecaries weighed medicine when they actually sold it. In old merchants' handbooks the former system is sometimes referred to as the pharmaceutical system, and distinguished from the apothecaries' system.|$|E

5|$|Both Houses of Congress were majority-Republican, {{but their}} {{solutions}} differed. The House {{passed a bill}} in June 1890 requiring the government to purchase 4.5 million <b>ounces</b> of silver each month (in addition to the $2– $4 million required to be coined under Bland–Allison). The Senate passed a bill by Republican Preston B. Plumb of Kansas for free coinage of silver at the legal (16:1) ratio. Sherman voted against Plumb's bill, but {{was appointed to the}} conference committee to produce a compromise bill that, now called the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, passed that July. The Treasury would buy 4.5 million <b>ounces</b> of silver and would issue Treasury Notes to pay for it, which would be redeemable in gold or silver. The law also provided that the Treasury could coin more silver dollars if the Secretary believed it necessary to redeem the new notes. Sherman thought the bill was the least harmful option. Harrison believed it would end the controversy, and he signed it into law. The effect of the bill, however, was the increased depletion of the nation's gold supply.|$|E
5|$|Due {{in part to}} the {{political}} conditions in what would become a united Kingdom of Italy only in 1861, the variation of apothecaries' systems and standard weights in this region was enormous. (For background information, see History of Italy during foreign domination and the unification.) The libbra (pound) generally consisted of the standard twelve <b>ounces,</b> however.|$|E

5|$|In {{the most}} complex placer mining, groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire river into a sluice {{alongside}} the river, and then dig for gold in the newly exposed river bottom.
