5000|$|Women {{artists have}} <b>often</b> <b>been</b> mis-characterized in {{historical}} accounts, both intentionally and unintentionally; such misrepresentations have <b>often</b> <b>been</b> {{dictated by the}} socio-political mores of the given era.

5|$|Stability {{constants}} of complexes: {{formation of}} a complex can <b>often</b> <b>be</b> seen as a competition between proton and metal ion for a ligand, which {{is the product of}} dissociation of an acid.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} recovered is analysed {{to reconstruct}} events or actions and to reach conclusions, work that can <b>often</b> <b>be</b> performed by less specialised staff.

50|$|Sorbitol <b>often</b> <b>is</b> used {{in modern}} {{cosmetics}} as a humectant and thickener. Sorbitol <b>often</b> <b>is</b> used in mouthwash and toothpaste. Some transparent gels {{can be made}} only with sorbitol, as it has a refractive index sufficiently high for transparent formulations.|$|R
50|$|It has <b>often</b> <b>been</b> {{described}} as gigantic flying snake which produced strange whistling sounds, while its gaze could paralyse an intended victim and permit it to suck its blood. It has <b>often</b> <b>been</b> reported {{as the cause}} of sucking blood from sheep.|$|R
50|$|Speakers of Surgujia have <b>often</b> <b>been</b> conflated {{with those}} of Chhattisgarhi. Furthermore, {{as is the case}} with many Hindi {{languages}} and other regional languages, Surgujia has <b>often</b> <b>been</b> subsumed under the all-encompassing bracket of Standard Hindi due to erroneous, arbitrary or politically-motivated categorisation.|$|R
5|$|An {{individual}} {{killer whale}} can <b>often</b> <b>be</b> identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and {{the pattern of}} white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.|$|E
5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} can <b>often</b> <b>be</b> {{traced to}} antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many {{can be detected}} through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} {{carnivorous}} {{nature and the}} beauty of their glistening traps, sundews have become favorite ornamental plants; however, the environmental requirements of most species are relatively stringent and can be difficult to meet in cultivation. As a result, most species are unavailable commercially. A few of the hardiest varieties, however, have made their way into the mainstream nursery business and can <b>often</b> <b>be</b> found for sale next to Venus flytraps. These most often include D. capensis, D. aliciae, and D. spatulata.|$|E

30|$|A general {{problem is}} that {{investments}} in rolling stock <b>often</b> <b>are</b> done by operators from a business perspective and investments in infrastructure <b>often</b> <b>are</b> done by the state from a socio-economic perspective.

5000|$|SRO landlords have <b>often</b> <b>been</b> called [...] "slumlords" [...] {{for failing}} to fix problems, and {{illegally}} evicting tenants.

5|$|Black-shouldered kites spiral {{into the}} wind like a kestrel. They soar with {{v-shaped}} up-curved wings, the primaries slightly spread and the tail widely fanned. In level flight progress is rather indirect. Their flight pattern {{has been described as}} 'winnowing' with soft steady beats interspersed with long glides on angled wings. They can most <b>often</b> <b>be</b> seen hovering with wings curved and tail pointing down.|$|E
5|$|Caprella mutica inhabit shallow {{protected}} marine {{bodies of}} water. They can <b>often</b> <b>be</b> found in dense colonies attached to submerged artificial structures, marine macroalgae, and other organisms. They are primarily omnivorous detritivores, but can adapt to other feeding methods depending on food availability. They are preyed upon by fish, crabs, {{and several other}} predators.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{does not}} react with water, {{but it does}} slowly react with {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can <b>often</b> <b>be</b> seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E

5|$|Gastrointestinal upset {{can cause}} severe discomfort; {{it is most}} common when {{metformin}} is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can <b>often</b> <b>be</b> avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually but even with low doses 5% of people {{may be unable to}} tolerate metformin. Use of slow- or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability.|$|E
5|$|In Iran, as of May 2014, {{according}} to its Yoga Association, there were approximately 200 yoga centres in the country, a quarter {{of them in the}} capital Tehran, where groups can <b>often</b> <b>be</b> seen practising in parks. This has been met by opposition among conservatives. In May 2009, Turkey's head of the Directorate of Religious Affairs, Ali Bardakoğlu, discounted personal development techniques such as reiki and yoga as commercial ventures that could lead to extremism. His comments were made in the context of reiki and yoga possibly being a form of proselytization at the expense of Islam.|$|E
5|$|In a {{practical}} implementation, the variables {{used to represent}} the indices will <b>often</b> <b>be</b> of fixed size, and this can result in an arithmetic overflow for very large arrays. If {{the midpoint of the}} span is calculated as (L + R) / 2, then the value of L + R may exceed the range of integers of the data type used to store the midpoint, even if L and R are within the range. If L and R are nonnegative, this can be avoided by calculating the midpoint as L + (R minus& L) / 2.|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} to Kogami's {{character has}} <b>often</b> <b>been</b> positive {{due to his}} traits and role in the series while his rivalry with Makishima has <b>often</b> <b>been</b> praised.

5000|$|The European jaguar has <b>often</b> <b>been</b> {{thought to}} be a forest-dwelling cat, similar in habits to the modern jaguar, {{although}} recent work suggests that the association between the European jaguar and forested habitats is not as strong as has <b>often</b> <b>been</b> assumed. It was probably a [...] animal.|$|R
5|$|In {{computer}} science, integer sorting is the algorithmic {{problem of}} sorting {{a collection of}} data values by numeric keys, {{each of which is}} an integer. Algorithms designed for integer sorting may also <b>often</b> <b>be</b> applied to sorting problems in which the keys are floating point numbers, rational numbers, or text strings. The ability to perform integer arithmetic on the keys allows integer sorting algorithms to be faster than comparison sorting algorithms in many cases, depending on the details of which operations are allowed in the model of computing and how large the integers to be sorted are.|$|E
5|$|Like many ink caps, {{it grows}} in tufts. It is {{commonly}} associated with buried wood and is found in grassland, meadows, disturbed ground, and open terrain from late spring to autumn. Fruiting bodies {{have been known to}} push their way up through asphalt and even tennis courts. It is also common in urban areas and appears in vacant lots, and tufts of fungi can be quite large and fruit several times a year. If dug up, the mycelium can <b>often</b> <b>be</b> found originating on buried dead wood.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} fish, shellfish, and {{crustaceans}} frequent both the local rivers and sea, notably crayfish and paua. Nugget Point {{in the northern}} Catlins hosts a particularly rich variety of marine wildlife. The establishment of a marine reserve off the coast here, discussed in 1992, 2004 and 2015, has been controversial. Hector's dolphins can <b>often</b> <b>be</b> seen close to the Catlins coast, especially at Porpoise Bay near Waikawa, which is protected {{as part of the}} Catlins Coast Marine Mammal Sanctuary, established in 2008. Migratory southern right whales and humpback whales can be spotted along the coastline during winter.|$|E
