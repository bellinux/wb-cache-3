5|$|The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which {{maintained}} its normal Saturday service schedule, announced that Metrorail ridership set a Saturday record of 825,437 trips, {{as compared to}} about 350,000 <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> Saturday, and beating out the previous record set in 1991 of 786,358 trips during the Desert Storm rally.|$|E
5|$|F-Zero GX is {{the first}} F-Zero game to feature a Story mode. Its story has the player {{assume the role of}} F-Zero pilot Captain Falcon in nine {{chapters}} of various racing scenarios; such as Falcon's training regiment, a race against a rival through a canyon with falling boulders, attack and eliminate a rival's gang, and escape from a collapsing building through closing blast doors. Each chapter can be completed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal,</b> hard, and very hard difficulty setting. Toshihiro Nagoshi, one of the game's co-producers, stated that this mode was included because the development team felt that the F-Zero universe was unique and they wanted to explain some of the characters' motivations and flesh out the game world.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} this interaction, Presley and Jackson spoke on the telephone almost every day, forging a strong friendship. The two came to realize they had much in common: both had been protected and sheltered from the real world, both felt they had missed out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> childhood, both were mistrustful of outsiders having {{spent most of their}} lives feeling exploited by them, and both had problems with the media. Presley was raised in Graceland, while Jackson lived at Neverland.|$|E

They agree {{when faced}} with the threat of having to talk to each other, and arrive at a Fortune Megastore, a venture of wealthy Arthur Fortune (modelled on British {{entrepreneur}} Richard Branson). Fortune easily charms the crowd and hands out dollar bills to his customers. This embarrasses the unpopular Mr. Burns, who asks Homer to help him be loved by all.|$|E
5|$|A US {{version of}} the music video was {{directed}} by Tim Hope. The video employs a dream-like animated world, with woodland glades, cartoon flowers which bloom instantly and the air full of clockwork-like insects and birds, but with real people embedded within it. On top of a mountain, a woman (Nerys Davies) waters plants inside a house. The band are aboard a horse carriage that travels through a rural landscape. A small coloured bird flies from the carriage up to the house, lands on the woman's windowsill and flaps its wings as if delivering a message. It transforms into a crow and then into a huge black menacing bird. The bird flies over the house and turns into a black cloud, which pours rain onto the land. The rain burns holes on the things it falls on, and crow feathers protrude from the holes. Finally a tornado lifts up the house, spinning it across the sky and then dropping it precisely <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> suburban street. The video's acclaimed visuals earned Hope an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002. It was also nominated for Breakthrough Video.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many other}} schools in Kyrgyzstan, Alisher Navoiy Secondary School {{is a double}} shift school where two streams of {{students}} (morning shift and evening shift) share the same facility.

25|$|With the {{introduction}} of the 1955 summer timetables, the services between London and Tunbridge Wells were entirely revised and the number of stopping passenger trains increased. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> weekday 136 trains called at Tunbridge Wells West: 66 departures and 70 arrivals; there were also nine goods trains (five in and four out) daily. In an 18-hour period between 6am and midnight, on average one passenger train departed or arrived every eight minutes.|$|E

25|$|Choline is a {{precursor}} to trimethylamine, which some persons {{are not able to}} break down due to a genetic disorder called trimethylaminuria. Persons suffering from this disorder may suffer from a strong fishy or otherwise unpleasant body odor, due to the body's release of odorous trimethylamine. A body odor will occur even <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> diet i.e., one that is not particularly high in choline. Persons with trimethylaminuria are advised to restrict the intake of foods high in choline; this may help to reduce the sufferer's body odor.|$|E
25|$|The piano had 44 notes, {{half the}} number of keys found <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> piano keyboard. It was played by regular hammers using a {{standard}} player piano action. The hammers were activated by electromagnets. The piano frame was made of iron, shaped like a shield, and symmetrically strung. The bass strings were at {{the centre of the}} frame and the treble strings radiated out to the edges from the centre. This arrangement distributed the string pressure more evenly across the frame and helped keep the piano in tune.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of the}} p-value in {{statistics}} was {{popularized by}} Ronald Fisher, and it plays {{a central role in}} his approach to the subject. In his influential book Statistical Methods for Research Workers (1925), Fisher proposes the level p = 0.05, or a 1 in 20 chance of being exceeded by chance, as a limit for statistical significance, and applies this to a normal distribution (as a two-tailed test), thus yielding the rule of two standard deviations (<b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> distribution) for statistical significance (see 68â€“95â€“99.7 rule).|$|E

25|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony was}} held at St. Nicholas Avenue and 123rd Street on March 14, 1925. The majority of the Eighth Avenue Line, from Chambers Street north to 207th Street, was {{opened to the public}} just after midnight on September 10, 1932 after three days of operation <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> schedule but without passengers. The Cranberry Street Tunnel, extending the express tracks east under Fulton Street to Jay Streetâ€“Borough Hall in Brooklyn, was opened for the morning rush hour on February 1, 1933. The Jayâ€“Smithâ€“Ninth Street Line opened on March 20, 1933, extending the line beyond Jay Streetâ€“Borough Hall.|$|E
25|$|The result (in seconds) for a {{prothrombin}} time performed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> individual will {{vary according to}} the type of analytical system employed. This is due to the variations between different types and batches of manufacturer's tissue factor used in the reagent to perform the test. The INR was devised to standardize the results. Each manufacturer assigns an ISI value (International Sensitivity Index) for any tissue factor they manufacture. The ISI value indicates how a particular batch of tissue factor compares to an international reference tissue factor. The ISI is usually between 0.94 and 1.4 for more sensitive and 2.0-3.0 for less sensitive thromboplastins.|$|E
25|$|In {{the average}} person, the {{diaphragm}} should be intersected by the 5th to 7th anterior ribs at the mid-clavicular line, and 9 to 10 posterior ribs should be viewable <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> PA inspiratory film. An {{increase in the}} number of viewable ribs implies hyperinflation, as can occur, for example, with obstructive lung disease or foreign body aspiration. A decrease implies hypoventilation, as can occur with restrictive lung disease, pleural effusions or atelectasis. Underexpansion can also cause interstitial markings due to parenchymal crowding, which can mimic the appearance of interstitial lung disease. Enlargement of the right descending pulmonary artery can indirectly reflect changes of pulmonary hypertension, with a size greater than 16mm abnormal in men and 15mm in women.|$|E
