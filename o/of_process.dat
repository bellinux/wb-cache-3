5|$|The {{book was}} hailed as an {{important}} addition to the literature in both environmental ethics and process philosophy. Garland offered two challenges to Palmer's claims. First, he challenged her linking <b>of</b> <b>process</b> ethics with individualist consequentialism, arguing that it is instead somewhere between individualist consequentialism and deep ecology. Second, he challenged Palmer's claim that process philosophers will always favour human ends over nonhuman ends. Cobb and Menta, though both welcoming her consideration <b>of</b> <b>process</b> philosophy, challenged Palmer's interpretation of the philosophy of Whitehead and Hartshorne {{on a number of}} points.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} is {{most commonly used}} to weld stainless steel and nonferrous materials, such as aluminum and magnesium, {{but it can be}} applied to nearly all metals, with a notable exception being zinc and its alloys. Its applications involving carbon steels are limited not because <b>of</b> <b>process</b> restrictions, but because of the existence of more economical steel welding techniques, such as gas metal arc welding and shielded metal arc welding. Furthermore, GTAW can be performed in a variety of other-than-flat positions, depending on the skill of the welder and the materials being welded.|$|E

5|$|Seymour Cray {{began the}} design of the Cray-3 in 1985, as soon as the Cray-2 reached production. Cray {{generally}} set himself the goal of producing new machines with ten times the performance of the previous models. Although the machines did not always meet this goal, this was a useful technique in defining the project and clarifying what sort <b>of</b> <b>process</b> improvements would be needed to meet it. For the Cray-3, he decided to set an even higher performance improvement goal, an increase of 12x over the Cray-2.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} part of a large reform {{movement}} to prevent equitable courts such as the Court of Chancery from undermining their business. It was far cheaper and faster than the older equivalents used by the Chancery and Common Pleas, leading to a drop in their business and an increase in that of the King's Bench. As such, the Chancery issued injunctions in an ineffective attempt to prevent its use. The Bill was finally abolished by the Uniformity <b>of</b> <b>Process</b> Act 1832.|$|E
30|$|Cognition is the information-handling {{aspect of}} behaviour.

To these four groups <b>of</b> <b>processes</b> may be added “attention”. Attention differs from the other four classes <b>of</b> <b>processes</b> because it underlies and energizes the activity of all cognitive functions.|$|R

5|$|Wider {{management}} failings {{were found}} by the investigation to {{have contributed to the}} explosion: management safety checks at the site were found to be deficient and not properly followed.

Further, overall throughput had increased, reducing wait times further and shifting the emphasis to process operations instead <b>of</b> <b>process</b> safety.|$|E

Hindley's release seemed imminent and plans were made by supporters for her to be given a new identity. Home Secretary David Blunkett ordered Greater Manchester Police to find new charges against her, to prevent her release from prison. The investigation was headed by Superintendent Tony Brett, and initially looked at charging Hindley with the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, but the advice given by government lawyers was that because of the DPP's decision taken 15 years earlier, a new trial would probably be considered an abuse <b>of</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

40|$|Large {{companies}} {{often use}} standardized template devel-opment <b>processes.</b> Project-specific adaptation <b>of</b> tem-plates must address aspects such as: project resources (time / staff), standards, regulations, etc. Adapting tem-plates {{is a particularly}} manual process requiring skill and for large companies {{a large proportion of}} the devel-opment cost. Integrating locally gained experiences and updating the template process is tedious work and re-sources for such updates are rarely available. Fortu-nately, formal representation <b>of</b> <b>processes</b> and process components enables reuse, analysis and comparison <b>of</b> <b>processes</b> and parts <b>of</b> <b>processes.</b> We use a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach which permits identification and reuse <b>of</b> <b>processes</b> or parts <b>of</b> <b>processes.</b> The formal notation allows the user to sketch new processes or adapt template processes. These sketches / adaptations are used in a matching process which identifies and suggest the reuse <b>of</b> similar <b>processes</b> and process components stored in the library. Once an adaptation has been successfully used, it is automatically added to the case library. 1...|$|R

40|$|Several Web {{process and}} {{workflow}} specification languages and {{systems have been}} developed to ease the task of modeling and supporting business processes. In a competitive e-commerce and e-business market, organizations want Web processes and workflows to be simple, modular, easy to understand, easy to maintain and easy to re-engineer. To achieve these objectives, one can calculate the complexity <b>of</b> <b>processes.</b> The complexity <b>of</b> <b>processes</b> is intuitively connected to effects such as readability, understandability, effort, testability, reliability and maintainability. While these characteristics are fundamental in the context <b>of</b> <b>processes,</b> no methods exist that quantitatively evaluate the complexity <b>of</b> <b>processes.</b> The major goal of this chapter is to describe a measurement to analyze the control-flow complexity <b>of</b> Web <b>processes</b> and workflows.

40|$|The V kernel {{supports}} {{an abstraction}} <b>of</b> <b>processes,</b> with operations for interprocess communication, process management, and memory management. This abstraction {{is used as}} a software base for constructing distributed systems. As a distributed kernel, the V kernel makes intermachine boundaries largely transparent. In this environment <b>of</b> many cooperating <b>processes</b> on different machines, there are many logical groups <b>of</b> <b>processes.</b> Examples include the group of tile servers, a group <b>of</b> <b>processes</b> executing a particular job, and a group <b>of</b> <b>processes</b> executing a distributed parallel computation.
