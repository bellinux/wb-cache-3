25|$|A {{thousand}} {{years after the}} death of Sorangath, The Apparitor appeared, heralding the return of The Leveler. Inhabiting the long dead body of Tireces, and assuming all his knowledge, The Leveler became known as Moagim. However, humanity had grown strong, and Moagim knew defeat was imminent. Using black magic, he <b>opened</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> into another realm, and found a race of fearless monsters known as Myrkridia. Shortly thereafter, he was captured by the Avatara, and drawn and quartered. However, he had already brought the Myrkridia into the world. Humanity were unprepared for such a vicious foe, and was hunted to near extinction. Only Llancarfan remained of the Cath Bruig Empire. In the mountainous lands of Gower, refugees {{from other parts of the}} world banded together for survival. One {{thousand years}} since the Myrkridia appeared, they remain undefeated in battle, and their numbers continue to grow. Meanwhile, a necromancer calling himself Moagim Reborn has emerged. However, in the western skies, The Apparitor heralds the coming of a new hero.|$|E
500|$|Members of Ferraro's {{family were}} indeed facing legal issues. Her husband John Zaccaro had {{pleaded guilty in}} , to fraudulently obtaining bank {{financing}} in a real estate transaction and had been sentenced to 150hours of community service. Then in , he was indicted on unrelated felony charges regarding an alleged 1981 bribery of Queens Borough President Donald Manes concerning a cable television contract. A full year later, he was acquitted at trial. The case against him was circumstantial, a key prosecution witness proved unreliable, and the defense {{did not have to}} present its own testimony. Ferraro said her husband never would have been charged had she not run for vice president. Meanwhile, in , the couple's son John had been arrested for possession and sale of cocaine. He was convicted, and in , sentenced to four months imprisonment; Ferraro broke down in tears in court relating the stress the episode had placed on her family. Ferraro worked on an unpublished book about the conflicting rights between a free press and being able to have fair trials. Asked in , whether she would have accepted the vice-presidential nomination had she known of all the family problems that would follow, she said, [...] "More than once I have sat down and said to myself, oh, God, I wish I had never gone through with it... I think the candidacy <b>opened</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> for women in national politics, and I don't regret that for one minute. I'm proud of that. But I just wish it could have been done in a different way." ...|$|E
500|$|Rambhadracharya {{is widely}} popular in Chitrakoot.

2500|$|A {{generation}} later, the Irish Anglican bishop, George Berkeley (1685–1753), {{determined that}} Locke's view immediately <b>opened</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> {{that would lead}} to eventual atheism. In response to Locke, he put forth in his Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710) an important challenge to empiricism in which things only exist either {{as a result of their}} being perceived, or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving. (For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.) [...] In his text Alciphron, Berkeley maintained that any order humans may see in nature is the language or handwriting of God. Berkeley's approach to empiricism would later come to be called subjective idealism.|$|E
2500|$|The Princess {{unveiled}} the medallion plaque of Edward VII in the vestibule. [...] Carved by Emil Fuchs, it {{was described as}} a [...] "most lifelike portrait of the late king." [...] The medallion itself was carved from Carrara marble and fixed to a framed panel of reddish-brown and white-veined rosso antico marble. The frame was described as being [...] "of a fine white free stone of a classical design." [...] The inscription on the panel said: [...] "This medallion was unveiled, and this building formally opened, by Her Royal Highness Princess Henry of Battenburg on behalf of Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Alexandra by whose gracious permission it was named The King Edward VII Memorial Hall, July 10th 1913." [...] F.W.J. Palmer presented her with a gold key; she <b>opened</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> to the Hall and declared it open.

2500|$|In August 1989, {{less than}} a month before the shooting, Wesbecker had started taking Prozac. The wounded and the {{families}} of those killed filed a lawsuit against the drug's manufacturer, Eli Lilly and Company, claiming that Wesbecker's use of Prozac contributed to his actions. The case went to jury trial. Midway through, defense testimony <b>opened</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> that would have allowed plaintiffs to make known to the jury Lilly's 1985 conviction for failing to report to the federal Food and Drug Administration adverse reactions to Oraflex, another Lilly drug. [...] The plaintiffs and Lilly then negotiated an agreement, which they concealed from the trial judge, John W. Potter. The trial continued, and plaintiffs never introduced the precedent of Lilly's conduct with respect to Oraflex. [...] The jury decided in Lilly's favor, and when plaintiffs failed to appeal, a suspecting Judge Potter uncovered the concealed agreement. With unanimous authorization from Kentucky's Supreme Court, he succeeded in amending the court record to show that the case was resolved by settlement rather than jury verdict.|$|E
