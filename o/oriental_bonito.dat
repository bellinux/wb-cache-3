40|$|A few {{specimens}} of the <b>Oriental</b> <b>Bonito,</b> Sarda orientalis were obtained on 28 - 7 - 1966 {{during one of}} my routine visits to the fish landing place at Ayodhyakuppam in Madras city. This species continued to occur for nearly a week in small quantities in the gill net landings which also brought good catches of the Indian Mackerel, Rastrelliger kmagurta. It is quite likely that the <b>Oriental</b> <b>Bonito</b> constitutes a sporadic fishery along {{the east coast of}} India also during June to September which is the season for its fishery along the West coast...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the species Wahoo, Acanthocybium solandri,landed by purse siene, was observed ffirst time in the inshore waters of the west coast other than at Vizhinjam and Colachel situated at the extreme southwest coast of India showing a northern extenision of along the west coast. The pursesiene landing of <b>Oriental</b> <b>bonito,</b> Sarda orientalis and bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus were also monitored and illustrated...|$|E

40|$|The <b>oriental</b> <b>bonito</b> (Sarda Orientalis T. and S.), locally {{known as}} thora-baleya, {{is the least}} {{abundant}} species of the bloodfish group commercially exploited from the inshore waters of Ceylon. The occurrence of this species in Ceylon waters has not been reported and hence it was considered valuable to present, the observations on this species, made {{in the course of}} the investigations into the more abundant relatives of this fish, in this preliminary report. In 1964 not more than few hundred pounds of this species was caught from the inshore waters of Ceylon. Since the popularisation of drift-nets for bloodfish fishery in the south, south-west and/west coasts of Ceylon, it is estimated that the annual production has risen to about one ton...|$|E
