40|$|<b>Mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> of {{groundnuts}} and maize in East Java was {{studied by}} means of a survey of farming practice and by field experiments. The influence of different sowing times and plant density of maize on the development and yield of groundnuts and maize were the main topics in this thesis. Plant arrangement, light use efficiency, and economic aspects were also investigated. The normal farming practice in East Java for <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> of groundnuts and maize was to sow the crops simultaneously {{at the end of the}} rainy season. The average plant densities used were: 190, 000 plants per hectare (167, 000 - 214, 000) for groundnuts (95 % of the plant density of the sole crop) and 40, 000 plants per hectare (31, 000 - 50, 000) for maize (53 % of the sole crop density). Average yields were 1140 kg/ha of groundnuts (80 % of the sole crop yield) and 900 kg/ha of maize (43 % of the sole maize yield). The average LER of the <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> was 1. 23, which means a 23 % higher productivity than the sole crops of groundnuts and maize. In the field experiments, the density of groundnuts was 160, 000 plants per hectare, and the density of sole maize was 125, 000 plants per hectare (80 x 20 cm, 2 plants per hill). In each of the experiments 3 to 7, the plant density of maize in the <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> was varied. in experiments 1 and 2, however, the maize density was 83, 000 plants per hectare (80 x 30 cm, 2 plants per hill), both in sole and <b>mixed</b> <b>crops.</b> In experiments 1 and 2, the sowing date of maize (sown at 100 % density) in the <b>mixed</b> <b>crop</b> was varied. Later sown maize plants were less developed and gave lower yields than simultaneouslysown maize. Groundnuts in the <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> showed a better development and yield when maize was sown later, but not as good as sole groundnuts. In experiment 2, the sole crop yields were much higher, and the response to a delay in sowing time of the maize was much stronger than in experiment 1. The higher yield was due to better nutrient availability and freedom from water stress in the beginning of the growing period. The most equal yield distribution between groundnuts and maize in <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> was reached when maize was sown about 10 days later than groundnuts. In experiments 3 to 5 the plant density of maize in the <b>mixed</b> <b>crop</b> was varied, with maize sown 10 days later than the groundnuts. At higher plant densities, the development and yield of the groundnut crop and of the individual maize plants was less than at lower maize densities. When maize was sown 10 days later than the groundnuts (100 % density), maximum maize yields in <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> were obtained at maize densities between 80 % and 150 % of the sole crop density, but the highest LER values for the <b>mixed</b> <b>crop</b> were reached with slightly lower maize densities between 70 % and 100 %. This was higher than the usual maize density in farmers' fields of about 50 % in <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> with simultaneously- sown groundnuts and maize. The effect of the arrangement of maize plants in <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> was small compared with the effect of plant density. only at extremely high maize densities, plant arrangement had a substantial effect (experiment 5). The interaction of sowing time effect and plant density effect, studied in experiments 6 and 7, showed that the longer the delay in sowing time of the maize, the higher the plant density of maize had to be, to reach maximum LER values for the <b>mixed</b> <b>crop.</b> The higher productivity of the <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> compared to sole maize can be explained by the higher percentage of intercepted light (67 % against 43 %), and compared to sole groundnuts by the better utilization of the intercepted light (1. 0 % against 0. 6 %). The revenues from the <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> were much higher than from sole maize and only slightly lower than from sole groundnuts. Delaying the sowing of maize in the <b>mixed</b> <b>crop</b> resulted in higher revenues. A change in the price ratio between groundnuts and maize from 4 : 1 to 2 : 1 would result in higher revenues for the <b>mixed</b> <b>crop</b> than for each of the sole crops (chapter g). In <b>mixed</b> <b>crops,</b> a higher share of the work was done by women (57 %) than in sole groundnuts (53 %) and sole maize (27 %). A 10 -day delay in the sowing time of maize resulted in a better spreading of the labour demand over the growing period. Sowing maize 10 days later than groundnuts at a density of 75 % of the normal sole crop density can be an improvement of the normal farming practice to sow maize at 50 % density simultaneously with the groundnuts. In <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> with 10 days delay in sowing time of maize and 70 % to 100 % maize density, the marketable yield was 1070 kg/ha of groundnuts and 1840 kg/ha of maize, averaged over the 7 field experiments. The groundnut yield in the experiments was similar to that in the farmers' practice with simultaneous sowing and 50 % maize density, and the maize yield was twice as high. In experiment 2, with its high fertility level and its adequate water supply, the LAI of sole maize was higher than 4, and sole maize yield was over 4 tons per hectare. In <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> with LAI values of maize higher than 4, the shading of the groundnut crop is too heavy, and no yield advantage can be expected from the <b>mixed</b> <b>crop</b> compared to the sole maize crop. Relay cropping can be a proper practice of intensive crop production when high yield levels are obtained with sole <b>crops.</b> <b>Mixed</b> <b>crops</b> are more secure than sole crops in situations of marginal farming, low soil fertility, unreliable water supply and low input level.

40|$|Since {{the green}} revolution, {{agricultural}} production has increased tremendously due to synthetic fertilizers, chemical crop protectants and high yielding plant varieties. However, soilborne pathogens remain yield-limiting factors in agricultural production. Hardly any sustainable solutions {{are available to}} control soilborne diseases and effective chemicals are limited and often have unwanted environmental side effects. Therefore, more sustainable ways of cultivating crops and agricultural production are needed. The general goal of this thesis research {{was to investigate the}} effect of <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> on soilborne diseases in organically managed soils and to unravel the mechanism(s) involved. First, the disease suppressiveness of organically managed soils against the soilborne fungal pathogen Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici and the role of antagonistic Pseudomonas bacteria were investigated. Take-all disease severity was lower in organically compared to conventionally managed soils. Naturally occurring populations of 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol producing pseudomonads were lower in organically managed soils. The initial establishment of an introduced fluorescent pseudomonad was hampered in these soils and its biocontrol efficacy was lower in the organically than in the conventionally managed soils, indicating that these pseudomonads do not {{play an important role in}} disease suppression in organically managed soils. Rather, microbial activity was likely important for disease suppression in the organically managed sandy soils. Disease levels are often lower in <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> compared to single crops. In this thesis we present an overview of soilborne pathogens in <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> and discuss the disease suppressive mechanisms that are involved. Furthermore, we studied the effects of <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> (Brussels sprouts-barley and triticale-white clover) in organically managed soils on suppressiveness against three soilborne pathogens. <b>Mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> did not result in enhanced disease suppressiveness compared to the single-cropped soils. Also soil microbial community structure and activity in <b>mixed</b> <b>cropped</b> soils were indistinguishable from single-cropped soils. Finally we investigated the effects of <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> triticale-clover on the development of Take-all disease under field and greenhouse conditions and the mechanisms involved. Under field conditions, Take-all disease severity increased for both single- and mix-cropped triticale over three consecutive years. Disease increase tended to be lower in the mixed- than in the single-cropped triticale. In the fourth year this trend was however reversed, probably due to bad clover establishment. In the greenhouse, Take-all disease was lower in the mix- than in the single-cropped triticale during five consecutive cycles. In both the field and greenhouse experiments clover biomass was negatively correlated with Take-all disease severity. Potential disease suppressive mechanisms stimulated by the clover biomass could be a change in triticale root architecture, host dilution, enhanced microbial activity, stimulation of antagonists in the rhizosphere and possibly increased ammonium concentrations in the rhizosphere. We conclude that effects of <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> systems on soilborne pathogens depend more on the crops or cultivars growing at that moment than on the <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> grown previously. Disease suppression in <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> is therefore a plant-driven process and effects are mainly observed in the rhizosphere and not in the bulk soil. Root architecture might have a large influence on the interactions that can take place in <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> and the selection of the crops or cultivars to be included in the mixture should be made with great care to have significant effects on soilborne plant pathogens...|$|R

Cereals benefit from the nitrogen fixing ability of legumes, which also result in higher protein levels in the cereal crop, improving its quality as fodder and potentially also as food. Grain legumes benefit from the reduced weed pressure in cereal crops. In the past 10 years, various combinations of cereal (particularly wheat, barley, oats and triticale) and legume (faba bean, peas and lupins) crops have been tested by the Louis Bolk Institute. To optimise the crop mixtures, each combination requires specific traits of the cereal and legume crop. So far, breeding has focused on mono-cropping. Including traits important for <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> will improve the potential of <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping.</b> In this poster we describe the advantages of each cereal legume combination and the traits on which breeding is needed to optimise its potential...|$|R
40|$|Oil crops can be {{integrated}} in organic <b>crop</b> rotations in <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> with <b>other</b> crops. The cropping system achieves only low oilseed yields but increases productivity per area in total yield. In theory soil nutrients in <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> systems can be used more efficiently due to different root architecture and growing times of the plants. But even the nutrient demand should increase with higher productivity. In the study nutri¬ent content and uptake of seeds and straw of mixtures of winter rape with winter-barley, peas, or rye, of spring peas with spring rape, mustard or false flax, of blue lupine with safflower or false flax, of spring wheat with linseed or false flax and of linseed with false flax were screened. Productivity per area was increased in many cases and nutrient contents of plants in the mixtures were frequently elevated com-pared to sole cropping systems. Nutrient demand of <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> is elevated due to its higher productivity and often determined by the suppressive partner...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>mixed</b> <b>{{cropping}}</b> on disease suppressiveness of soils was tested for two cropping systems, Brussels sprouts¿barley and triticale¿white clover. Disease suppressiveness of field soils was evaluated in bioassays for the soilborne pathogens Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini, and Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. For both <b>cropping</b> systems, <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> did not enhance disease suppressiveness of the soils. In some cases, soil cropped to barley alone was significantly more suppressive to F. oxysporum f. sp. lini than soils cropped to Brussels sprouts or {{the mixture of}} Brussels sprouts and barley. Analyses {{of the diversity of}} the indigenous bacterial and fungal microflora by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of amplified 16 S- and 18 S-rDNA fragments, respectively, revealed, in most cases, no significant differences between mixed and mono-cropped soils. In conclusion, in this study, <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> of soils with Brussels sprouts and barley or with triticale and white clover did not enhance microbial diversity or disease suppressiveness of soils to three different soilborne plant pathogens...|$|R

40|$|<b>Mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> {{systems with}} oil crops are of growing {{interest}} in organic farming. They can offer agricultural advances like competition against weeds, support against lodg¬ing and buffering of yield fluctuations. The aim of the cultivation method is to gain additional oil yields for energy or feed purposes. The reported higher land-efficiency-ratios of those <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> systems should lead to higher nutrient requirements. But it is unknown if the different crops just compete for rare soil nutrients or if comple¬mentary effects in <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> systems lead to higher nutrient efficiency. In a field study N-contents in plants and N uptake of diverse <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> systems were compared to sole cropping systems. In linseed (Linum usitatissivum) or false flax (Camelina sativa) in combination with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) the oil crops showed lower N contents during stem elongation. The N concentrations in wheat tissue were not affected by competition. Wheat was dominating the mixtures. In mix-tures of peas (Pisum sativum) with false flax elevated N concentra¬tions in plant tissue of both component crops were determined. In non-leguminous mixtures with RYT > 1 (spring wheat x false flax), N uptake exceeded the N-require¬ment of the sole crops. In mixtures of legumes with oil crops with RYT > 1 (peas x false flax), the N-uptake of the mixtures was equivalent to or exceeded the N uptake of sole-cropped oil crops...|$|R
