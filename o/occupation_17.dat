40|$|OBJECTIVE: Treatment of {{depression}} {{should result in}} the absence of symptoms, i. e. remission, in order to restore the functional status of the patient and reduce the risk for relapse. The study assessed the current remission rates in primary care and determined the influencing factors. METHODS: 10 consecutive depressive patients treated by antidepressants for at least 3 months and not more than 12 months were screened by each investigator. Remission rates were defined using the Hamilton-Depression scale 7 items (score of 3 or less) as well as the Carroll self rating scale (score of 7 or less). In addition, patients completed the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Initial severity {{of depression}}, type of treatment and socio-economic factors were collected. RESULTS: 292 general practitioners screened a total of 2630 patients. Results indicated low remission rates: 28. 3 % according to the clinician and 17. 1 % according to the patient. Absence of remission was associated with higher impairment in work, social and family life. The most frequently reported residual symptoms in nonremitters were general somatic symptoms (92 %), depressed mood (92 %), psychic anxiety (91 %) and impaired work and activities (89 %). No differences were observed in remission rates between men and women. Remission rates were significantly lower in patients living alone as compared to those living in couple or family (25. 1 % vs 30. 2 %, p= 0. 03), in patients with lower education (21. 3 % vs 32. 3 %, p< 0. 001), in patients speaking French as compared to Dutch (24. 0 % vs 34. 0 % p< 0. 001), and unemployed patients compared to patients having an <b>occupation</b> (<b>17.</b> 1 % vs 39. 0 %, p< 0. 001). Higher initial severity and number of previous episodes decreased remission rates (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSION: This study shows low remission rates in depressed patients treated in general practice. The absence of remission is associated with impairment in work, social and family life. Special attention should be given to identify patients who do not reach remission. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Palynological and archaeological studies at Ahanve, a settlement in the BCA were undertaken recently to improve the understanding of past human exploitation of aquatic resources. Collected data revealed contrasts in the availability and utilisation of aquatic resources between a first occupation phase (9 th- 17 th centuries AD) and a second <b>occupation</b> phase (<b>17</b> th century AD to present). The environment during the first phase was characterised by secondary forest and freshwater swamp. During this period, the inhabitants consumed cat-fish (Clariidae) and bivalves (Anodonta sp.), and engaged in salt production. The salt was produced from brine obtained from the Atlantic Ocean. Aquatic food resources were supplemented with terrestrial animal and plant foods. During the second occupation phase, aquatic resources (cat-fish and bivalves) declined and subsequently disappeared; salt production was discontinued while terrestrial foods, particularly plant-based types, increased significantly. These events coincided with the arrival of European travellers. Oral sources suggest that the decline in the exploitation of aquatic resources was in part due to the fear of being taken captive while on fishing expeditions, restrictions by Europeans who controlled the water-ways, and the massive importation of salt which replaced local production...|$|R

40|$|Given {{the clear}} benefit for {{both public and}} private {{finances}} of extending work lives, many policymakers are interested in finding and promoting ways to accomplish this objective while balancing concerns for work ability at older ages. At the same time, retirement itself is transforming from a simple transition from full-time work to full and permanent retirement to more of a process, potentially occurring in several stages over a number of years. We consider a set of work transitions at ages when the largest numbers of people are retiring and potentially pursuing different paths to full and permanent retirement. Among workers who transition between occupations, the most common transitions are between those that are closely related. However, even within closely related occupations, there are no large pipelines between any two. By age 62, 57 percent of workers are no longer in the labor force, 26 percent are still in their “career” <b>occupation,</b> and <b>17</b> percent have changed from their career occupation to another occupation. Beginning at age 66, however, the percentages in different occupations, which may be bridge employment or unretirement, are very similar to the percentages remaining in career occupations.

40|$|For {{more than}} two years, the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) {{has been working with}} Navy Recruiting Command in an effort to {{increase}} the recruitment of quality people from community colleges for the enlisted ranks. Part of this effort concentrates on the recruitment of pre-trained people in order to reduce or eliminate the cost of Navy training. Employment trends are increasing the need for technically trained people to fill jobs that require more training than a high school diploma but less than a four-year college degree. Both the state and federal governments are promoting incentives to help young people prepare for the workforce. Two of these incentive programs, the School-to-Work Opportunities Act (STWOA) and the Tech Prep Act, could benefit the Navy by forming partnerships to create tailor-made courses of study around training curricula that have civilian overlap. More than 60 % of U. S. businesses with 1, 000 or more employees participate in STW programs, and 91 % of those businesses provide work-based learning to students.

40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} how class origin shapes earnings in higher professional and managerial employment. Taking advantage of newly released data in Britain’s Labour Force Survey, {{we examine the}} relative openness of different high-status occupations and the earnings of the upwardly mobile within them. In terms of access, we find a distinction between traditional professions, such as law, medicine, and finance, which are dominated by the children of higher managers and professionals, and more technical occupations, such as engineering and IT, that recruit more widely. Moreover, even when people who are from working-class backgrounds are successful in entering high-status <b>occupations,</b> they earn <b>17</b> percent less, on average, than individuals from privileged backgrounds. This class-origin pay gap translates to up to £ 7, 350 ($ 11, 000) lower annual earnings. This difference is partly explained by the upwardly mobile being employed in smaller firms and working outside London, but it remains substantial even net {{of a variety of}} important predictors of earnings. These findings underline the value of investigating differences in mobility rates between individual occupations as well as illustrating how, beyond entry, the mobile population often faces an earnings “class ceiling” within high-status occupations...|$|R

The following substances exhibited moderately strong associations: metallic dust, liquid fuel combustion products, lubncating oils and greases, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons from coal.

At least some of the workers who claim they prefer PT work, in reality choose full-time jobs when available, as shown during the latest economic expansion when voluntary PT work declined from 18. 4 % in the second quarter of 1995 to 16. 9 % in the second quarter of 1999.

The MOF  15 and 17 have comparably lower stayer rates of 39 % and 43 %, respectively, because their labour can be applied in very diverse fields.

The students occupying the building made a list of demands, including [...] "greater student representation in Senate meetings" [...] and [...] "That the Vice-Chancellor, Eric Thomas, write and send an open letter to the Government condemning cuts in the education budget and appealing to them not to implement these policies, and to publicly call for Vice-Chancellors across the country to unite against these cuts, any rise in tuition fees and the removal of Educational Maintenance Allowance and Aimhigher." [...] The occupiers received a considerable amount of support from members of staff. The <b>occupation</b> ended on <b>17</b> December 2010, with students leaving voluntarily and stating: [...] "Although the occupiers’ main demand [...] was not met, the occupation has, in many ways, yielded much more meaningful outcomes than being granted particular requests by senior management." ...|$|R
