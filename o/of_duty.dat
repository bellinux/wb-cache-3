The framework leverages existing control frameworks and guidelines to build best practices for segregating duties in each major business cycle. The framework has implications for companies looking to automate the resolution <b>of</b> segregation <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> and reduce costs. From an assurance standpoint, auditors can benefit from the framework to increase efficiency and reduce audit costs. We provide extensions of the current study.

40|$|<b>Duty</b> <b>of</b> Care in Czech and German Civil Law Abstract The thesis {{deals with}} the {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> to prevent damages (<b>duties</b> <b>of</b> care) in Czech civil law. It focuses on detailed analysis of a few provisions of the Czech Civil Code. The main {{attention is focused on}} s. 415 of the Civil Code (Act No. 40 / 1964 Coll, the Civil Code, as amended; "OZ") establishing "the general <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care". Findings about <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> care in the Civil Code are compared to a system <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> care in German law of delict and additionally discussed using tools of economic analysis of law. The paper results in recommending changes in wording and interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> care and their comparison with the wording established by Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., Civil Code ("NOZ"), effective from 1 January 2014. Chapter One examines development of interpretation of main provisions <b>of</b> OZ establishing <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> care. It briefly analyzes basic aspects of law of delict of OZ. It makes use of these findings in order to describe a position <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> care in law of delict and limits of their interpretation. The main imperfections of their interpretation are illustrated on a couple of judicial decisions. Chapter Two briefly describes the system of law of delict under the German Civil Code ("BGB").

This thesis comprehensively explains <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> members of Limited Liability Company in terms of Business Corporations Act and, where appropriate, compares them with those contained in the Commercial Code. After the brief discourse about Limited Liability Company, its nature and its position among the business corporations, the thesis provides characteristics of a share with emphasis on its qualitative aspect. In the second chapter the schemes <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> members in works of various authors are first of all compared and critically assessed, and subsequently the own division <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> members is created. A criterion for the division <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> is the fact, whether they are governed by general or special regulation and in the latter whether the duties arise on the basis of the act, or the Memorandum of Association. The characteristics <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> itself is included in the third to sixth chapters, which successively explain the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, the contributory duty, the liability <b>duty,</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> additional contribution, the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> personal participation on a company, the duty to contribute to the [...] ...|$|R

5|$|In {{his paper}} The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories, philosopher Michael Stocker {{challenges}} Kantian ethics (and all modern ethical theories) {{by arguing that}} actions from duty lack certain moral value. He gives the example of Smith, who visits his friend in hospital out <b>of</b> <b>duty,</b> rather than because of the friendship; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing. Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point. After presenting {{a number of reasons}} that we might find acting out <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> objectionable, she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is. Acting out <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> is not intrinsically wrong, but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do. Duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal: one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships. Baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motive—that is, a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done, rather than prompt specific actions. She argues that, seen this way, duty neither reveals a deficiency in one's natural inclinations to act, nor undermines the motives and feelings that are essential to friendship. For Baron, being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act; rather, it entails that considerations <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> are always action-guiding. A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions, such as questions of character. These should guide moral agents to act from duty.|$|E
