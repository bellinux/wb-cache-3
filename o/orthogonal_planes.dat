2500|$|Like Archipenko and Csaky, both Lipchitz and Henri Laurens {{were aware}} of {{primitive}} African art, though hardly evident in their works. Lipchitz collected African art from 1912 on, but Laurens, in fact, {{appears to have been}} entirely unaffected by African art. Both his early reliefs and three-dimensional sculptures attach problems posed by Cubist painters first. Lipchitz and Laurens were concerned with giving tangible substance to idea first pronounced by Jean Metzinger in his 1910 Note sur la peinture of simultaneous multiple views. [...] "They were", as Goldwater notes, [...] "undoubtedly impressed with the natural three-dimensionality of African sculpture and with its rhythmic interplay of solid and related void. But in its frontality and mass, though often composed of cubic shapes, it was anything but cubist, and was indeed, fundamentally anti-cubist in conception". The African sculptor, writes Goldwater, [...] "whether his forms were rectangular, elliptical, or round in outline, and whether he cut back little or much into the cylinder of fresh wood with which he began, was content to show one aspect of his figure at a time". Goldwater continues: :"He achieved his [...] "instinctive" [...] three-dimensional effect by calculated simplification and separation of parts that allowed the eye to grasp each one as a unified, coherent mass. The cubist sculptor, on the other hand, wished to [...] "make his figure turn" [...] by simultaneously showing or suggesting frontal and <b>orthogonal</b> <b>planes,</b> by flattening diagonals, and by swinging other hidden surfaces into view." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Primary heat {{dissipation}} method of IC Chip is still air-cooling at present. This paper presents a new machining method of air-cooled plate fin heat sinks, namely <b>orthogonal</b> <b>planing.</b> The surface of plate fins machined by this method are rough enough to augment its specific surface area; the rough surface can also disturb laminar sub-layer of turbulent thermal boundary layer, thus the thermal resistances of thermal boundary layer are reduced. Therefore, {{heat dissipation}} efficiency of heat sink {{can be enhanced}} further. The focus of plate fin heat sinks forming by <b>orthogonal</b> <b>planing</b> is how to machine flat chips. A new pattern of chip curl that is called down-curl can be observed when rake angle of tool is rather large and cutting thickness is very thin. As cutting thickness increases, down-curl chips become flat and then up-curling. There is a transition area that chips are not curled between down- and up-curl. The conditions that chips are not curled are obtained through investigating influences of rake angle and cutting thickness on chip curl, and flat plate fins with rough surface are produced...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE Standard two-dimension (2 D) {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) clinical acquisition protocols utilize <b>orthogonal</b> <b>plane</b> images which contain slice gaps (SG). The purpose of this work is to introduce a novel interpolation method for these <b>orthogonal</b> <b>plane</b> MRI 2 D datasets. Three goals can be achieved: (1) increasing the resolution based on a priori knowledge of scanning protocol, (2) ameliorating the loss of data {{as a result of}} SG and (3) reconstructing a three-dimension (3 D) dataset from 2 D images. METHODS MRI data was collected using a 3 T GE scanner and simulated using Matlab. The procedure for validating the MRI data combination algorithm was performed using a Shepp–Logan and a Gaussian phantom in both 2 D and 3 D of varying matrix sizes (64 – 512), as well as on one MRI dataset of a human brain and on an American College of Radiology {{magnetic resonance}} accreditation phantom. RESULTS The squared error and mean squared error were computed in comparing this scheme to common interpolating functions employed in MR consoles and workstations. The mean structure similarity matrix was computed in 2 D as a means of qualitative image assessment. Additionally, MRI scans were used for qualitative assessment of the method. This new scheme was consistently more accurate than upsampling each orientation separately and averaging the upsampled data. CONCLUSION An efficient new interpolation approach to resolve SG was developed. This scheme effectively fills in the missing data points by using <b>orthogonal</b> <b>plane</b> images. To date, there have been few attempts to combine the information of three MRI plane orientations using brain images. This has specific applications for clinical MRI, functional MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging/diffusion tensor imaging and MR angiography where 2 D slice acquisition are used. In these cases, the 2 D data can be combined using our method in order to obtain 3 D volume...|$|R
