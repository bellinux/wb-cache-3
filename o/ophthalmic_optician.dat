40|$|Case {{notes of}} 1113 {{consecutive}} new patients {{referred to a}} consultant ophthalmologist at a district general hospital were reviewed to determine the source and efficacy of referrals and the current screening practices of general practitioners and <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>opticians.</b> General practitioners initiated referral in 546 cases (49 %) and <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>opticians</b> referral in 439 (39 %). Visual loss or visual disturbance {{was the most important}} single reason for referral (345 cases; 31 %), followed by suspected glaucoma (145 cases; 13 %), abnormalities of binocular vision (140; 12. 5 %), disorders of eyelids or ocular adnexa (127; 11 %), and red eye (86; 8 %). General practitioners referred many more patients with disorders of the eyelids and adnexa and <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>opticians</b> many more patients with suspected glaucoma. <b>Ophthalmic</b> <b>opticians</b> were far more likely than general practitioners to refer patients with suspected glaucoma correctly. A total of 180 patients (16 %) were referred from ocular screening, in 149 cases by <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>opticians</b> and in 10 by general practitioners. Seventy patients had glaucoma or incomplete features of glaucoma, all of them referred by <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>opticians.</b> Of eight diabetic patients referred by <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>opticians,</b> three had asymptomatic disease and in two diabetes was diagnosed as a result of ocular screening. No patient was referred for asymptomatic diabetic retinopathy from screening by general practitioners. <b>Ophthalmic</b> <b>opticians</b> were more likely than general practitioners to diagnose retinopathy requiring photocoagulation.

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is a {{major cause}} of blindness in England and Wales in those aged between 30 and 64. Photocoagulation can frequently prevent blindness provided the retinopathy is detected at an appropriate stage but unfortunately the benefits are small if the changes are advanced. Early detection of diabetic retinopathy by regular examination is needed. We have shown that <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>opticians</b> have the skill to detect retinal changes at a treatable stage. Out of 844 eye checks, 80 were reported by <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>opticians</b> to justify referral to an ophthalmologist and 20 of these required photocoagulation treatment. Of a sample of 197 patients rechecked by an ophthalmologist reported by <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>opticians</b> not to justify referral, only one needed treatment. With local agreement this system of detecting retinopathy could be easily applied anywhere in the United Kingdom. No extra personnel or facilities are needed...|$|R

40|$|In {{the period}} of 1982 - 1984, a cross sectional, {{prevalence}} study of eye disease in the elderly population of Melton Mowbray was carried out. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the prevalence of the three major blinding conditions in the elderly, namely senile cataract, chronic open-angle glaucoma and age related macular degeneration. The study population was a random sample of the surviving cohort of the Household Survey, which had previously been carried out by the Department of Community Health. Participants were asked to attend a special eye clinic in Melton Mowbray, where each was examined by an Ophthalmologist and an <b>Ophthalmic</b> <b>Optician.</b> The examination included measurement of visual acuity, refraction slit-lamp examination and fundus examination and photography after mydriasis. 529 persons from a study population of 677, participated in the study a response rate of 78 %. The prevalence of senile cataract was 55. 9 %, chronic open angle glaucoma 4. 5 % and age-related macular degeneration 42 %. Only 1. 1 % of the study participants had diabetic retinopathy. Significant associations for senile cataract were increasing age (p 0. 05) and the female sex (p 0. 001); for open angle-glaucoma, family history (p 0. 001) and the absence of arcus senilis (p 0. 05) and for macular degeneration, increasing age (p 0. 02) and the absence of arcus senilis (p 0. 001). A quarter of all participants had a corrected visual acuity of less than 6 / 18 in their better eye but over 80 % had a reading vision of at least N 8.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a sociological {{study of the}} {{ophthalmic}} optical profession in Britain. It includes {{a survey of the}} development of ophthalmic optics as an occupation and three questionnaire, surveys, one each of first and final year ophthalmic optics students, and one of practising opticians. The developmental survey showed that four themes have been important in the occupation's process of professionalisation - the actions of the opticians' leaders, the gradual unification of the bodies, representing segments of the profession, the struggle with medicine and the involvement of <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>opticians</b> in state-organised optical welfare schemes. The student surveys showed that the profession is now recruiting largely from middle class, state educated groups, and increasingly from women, who hold significantly different attitudes to income, independence and career commitment. In general, both first and final year students considered service to be rather more important than furthering knowledge. Practising opticians have been recruited increasingly, from middle class backgrounds, mostly from state selective secondary schools, but with a large minority from non-state schools. The self-recruitment rate of the profession (18. 9 %) is very similar to that for British medical students. Significant differences in concepts of professionalism were found among <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>opticians</b> of different ages, sexes and types of practice but few among those in different areas of practice. In general, <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>opticians</b> seemed to stress service more·than furthering knowledge. It is suggested that the leaders of the profession have 'negotiated' considerable autonomy for its members and that the possibilities for commercialism within the ophthalmic optician's professional role are intrinsically no greater than those in more 'established' professions...|$|R

50|$|Optometry is {{a health}} care {{profession}} which involves examining the eyes and applicable visual systems for defects or abnormalities {{as well as the}} medical diagnosis and management of eye disease. Traditionally, the field of optometry began with the primary focus of correcting refractive error through the use of spectacles. Modern day optometry, however, has evolved through time so that the educational curriculum additionally includes intensive medical training in the diagnosis and management of ocular disease in countries where the profession is established and regulated. Optometrists (also known as Doctors of Optometry in the US and Canada for those holding the O.D. degree or <b>Ophthalmic</b> <b>Opticians</b> in the UK) are medical professionals who provide primary eyecare through comprehensive eye examinations to detect and treat various visual abnormalities and eye diseases. Being a regulated profession, an optometrist's scope of practice may differ depending on the location. Thus, disorders or diseases detected outside the treatment scope of optometry are referred out to relevant medical professionals for proper care, more commonly to ophthalmologists who are medical doctors that specialize in advanced medical and surgical care of the eye. Optometrists typically work closely together with other eye care professionals such as ophthalmologists and opticians to deliver quality and efficient eyecare to the general public.|$|R

40|$|THIS {{investigation}} was {{initiated by the}} clinical observation that patients with angle-closure glaucoma appeared to exhibit {{a higher incidence of}} inverse astigmatism than normal. In order to determine the significance or otherwise of this observation, the spectacle refraction of 150 patients with angle-closure glaucoma was noted over a period of 5 years. The diagnosis of these cases was {{made on the basis of}} the history, clinical picture, and gonioscopy findings. 60 per cent. of the patients presented with acute congestive glaucoma; 14 per cent. with symptoms of haloes; 3 per cent. with a unilateral semi-dilated pupil; 2 per cent. with retinal artery pulsation; 2 per cent. with venous thrombosis. so _ so I The patients were grouped in 10 -yearly 40 -age group intervals so that a comparison with the normal could be made and a o 30 frequency polygon was constructed (Fig. S l 1).

40|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} is {{an important}} cause of blindness in the Western World. A review of the randomised trials of laser photocoagulation of the retina {{as a method of}} preventing blindness from this disorder showed that this treatment is very effective, reducing the risk of blindness by 61 % in a treated eye. As only one eye is needed for sight the reduction in blindness in a population will be greater than 61 % because the effect of treatment in one eye is not always identical with the effect in the other eye. For analysis this reduction was taken as 73 %, representing the average of the minimum and maximum estimates (61 % and 85 %). The effectiveness of this treatment suggests that there is the potential for a national screening programme to bring about a major reduction in blindness from this cause. A quantitative assessment of the effect of screening indicated that a programme in which patients with diabetes mellitus are systematically referred to <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>opticians</b> for a retinal examination could detect 88 % of all diabetics with serious retinopathy and that 87 % of these cases would be treatable. Screening and early treatment of retinopathy would prevent deterioration of visual acuity and could reduce the risk of blindness due to diabetic retinopathy by an estimated 56 % (0. 73 X 0. 88 X 0. 87). The findings suggest that an effectively managed community based screening programme encompassing detection, referral, treatment, and follow up would prevent about 260 new cases of blindness in diabetics under the age of 70 each year in England and Wales. This would represent over 10 % of all cases of blindness in adults in this age group...|$|R
40|$|Soft {{hydrophilic}} (gel) {{contact lenses}} {{have been in}} use for a decade since they were introduced by Wichterle, Lim, and Max Dreifus, but their de-velopment as a commercial enterprise has taken place only {{during the past five}} years. It is now estimated {{that more than half of}} new patients being fitted with contact lenses have hydrophilic soft lenses. Statistics were prepared to show the clinical pattern in soft contact lens wear regarding visual acuity, keratometry, state of lids, conjunc-tivae, cornea, atopy, and contraceptive pill impli-cations. Some data have previously been given (Chaston and Morris, I 975; Brown and Lobascher, 1975; Ruben, 1975; Chaston, I 974). The data have been programmed by computer but the results will be discussed in the light of clinical experience. This report is concerned chiefly with the analysis of clinical data. Data concerning lens behaviour, visual acuity, and wearing patterns were given previously (Chaston, 1974). Population A total of I 5 I volunteers were fitted with five types of hydrophilic soft lenses and studied for one year by ophthalmologists and <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>opticians.</b> Patients were allowed to wear the lenses for the maximum tolerable times daily; care and disinfection of the lenses were as advised by the manufacturers.

40|$|YesAim: To {{assess the}} ability of {{critical}} flicker frequency (CFF) and optimal reading speed (ORS) to predict the potential vision in patients with cataract with and without ocular comorbidity. Methods: The two novel tests were compared with two well established potential vision tests (PVTs), the potential acuity meter (PAM) and the laser interferometer (LI). Measurements were made preoperatively in 1 eye of 88 subjects using the battery of 4 PVTs. Postoperative measurements were made with the CFF and the ORS. The subjects studied were consecutive cases over a 12 -month period who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and {{agreed to participate in}} this study. Results: CFF was the PVT most resistant to the presence of cataract. Both CFF and ORS give a similar predictive precision in the presence of cataract and ocular comorbidity, although CFF seems more precise when the cataract is dense. Conclusions: The PAM and the LI showed a limited clinical capability in predicting postoperative visual acuity, particularly with dense opacities. The CFF shows the most promise as a PVT, particularly with dense cataract. Further evaluation is required for both CFF and ORS. Federation of <b>Ophthalmic</b> and Dispensing <b>Optician...</b>|$|R
40|$|YesThis article {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on how blurred vision contributes to falls, gait, and postural control and discusses how these are influenced by spectacle correction. Falls are common and represent a very serious health risk for older people. They are not random events {{as studies have shown}} that falls are linked to a range of intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. Vision provides a significant input to postural control in addition to providing information about the size and position of hazards and obstacles in the travel pathway and allows us to safely negotiate steps and stairs. Many studies have shown that reduced vision is a significant risk factor for falls. However, randomized controlled trials of optometric interventions and cataract surgery have not shown the expected reduction in falls rate, which may be due to magnification changes (and thus vestibuloocular reflex gain) in those participants who have large changes in refractive correction. Epidemiological studies have also shown that progressive addition lens and bifocal wearers {{are twice as likely to}} fall as non-multifocal wearers, laboratorybased studies have shown safer adaptive gait with single-vision glasses than progressive addition lenses or bifocals, and a randomized controlled trial has shown that an additional pair of distance vision single-vision glasses for outdoor use can reduce falls rate. Clinical recommendations to help optometrists prevent their frail, older patients from falling are suggested.

40|$|YesPurpose. A {{recent study}} {{suggested}} that updated spectacles could increase falls rate in older people. We hypothesized {{that this may}} be due to changes in spectacle magnification and this study assessed the effects of spectacle magnification on adaptive gait. Methods. Adaptive gait and visual function was measured in 10 older adults (mean age 77. 1 ¿ 4. 3 years) with the participants¿ optimal refractive correction and when blurred with + 1. 00 DS, + 2. 00 DS, - 1. 00 DS and - 2. 00 DS lenses. Adaptive gait measurements for the lead and trail foot included foot position before the step, toe clearance of the step edge and foot position on the step. Vision measurements included visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and stereoacuity. Results. The blur lenses led to equal decrements in visual acuity and stereoacuity for the + 1. 00 DS and - 1. 00 DS and the + 2. 00 DS and - 2. 00 DS lenses. However, they had very different effects on adaptive gait compared to the optimal correction: Positive blur lenses led to an increased distance of the feet from the step, increased vertical toe clearance and reduced distance of the lead heel position on the step. Negative lenses led to the opposite of these changes. Conclusion. The adaptive gait changes did not mirror the effects of blur on vision, but were driven by the magnification changes of the lenses. Steps appear closer and larger with positive lenses and further away and smaller with negative ones. Magnification likely explains the mobility problems some older adults have with updated spectacles and after cataract surgery. Federation of <b>Ophthalmic</b> and Dispensing <b>Optician...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} how visual information is organised in perceptual short term memory, with special interest in colour, spatial frequency and velocity. Previous studies of VSTM have indicated the existence of specific memory mechanisms for visual attributes such as orientation, spatial frequency, velocity, contrast and colour. The retention of information in visual short term memory for these basic visual attributes can be disrupted by the presentation of masking stimuli during inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs), which are outside the range of traditional sensory masking. We exploited this memory masking effect {{in order to examine}} the organisation of visual information in VSTM. Four groups of experiments were conducted in which participants carried out a delayed discrimination paradigm that employed a two-alternative forced choice (2 -AFC) procedure in conjunction with a method of constant stimuli. The fidelity of VSTM was measured by performance markers such as discrimination thresholds and point of subjective equalities. We have found selective memory masking effects, which serve as further evidence in favour of the modular organisation in VSTM, namely, that human visual perceptual memory is based upon multiple, tuned channels in case of colour, spatial frequency and speed, similar to those found in the earliest stages of visual processing for spatial frequency. Moreover, each of these storage mechanisms are tuned to a relatively narrow range of stimulus parameters that are closely linked to visual discrimination mechanisms. These findings add further support to the view that low-level sensory processing mechanisms form the basis for the retention of colour, spatial frequency and velocity information in perceptual memory. We also found evidence for the broad range of transfer of memory masking effects across spatial location, which indicates more long range, long duration interactions between channels that are likely to rely upon contributions from neural processes located in higher visual areas. In conclusion, the experiments presented in this thesis provide significant insight into the organization of visual information in perceptual short term memory.
