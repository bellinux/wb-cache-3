5|$|The {{first episode}} <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> in the North gained 5.1 million viewers on its {{original}} transmission, {{and the first}} six episodes each gained between 4.5 and 5.5 million viewers. In terms of viewing figures, the series became BBC Two's most successful weekly drama for five years.|$|E
5|$|The scale <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> in the North {{required}} BBC Two controller Michael Jackson {{to devote}} {{a budget of}} £8 million to the production, which was half of his channel's drama serials budget for the entire year. Producer Charles Pattinson attempted to gain co-production funding from overseas broadcasters, but none was interested. Pattinson believed {{it was because the}} story was so much about Britain and had limited appeal to other countries. BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm which sells its programmes overseas, offered only £20,000 of funding towards the production. The speaking cast <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> in the North numbered 160; more than 3,000 extras were used, and filming took place across 40 weeks, from November 1994 until September 1995.|$|E

5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>friends.</b> In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E
5|$|Our Friends in the North was {{originally}} {{written by the}} playwright Peter Flannery for the theatre, {{while he was a}} writer in residence for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). The idea came to Flannery while he was watching the rehearsals for the company's production of Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2 at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1980; the scale of the plays inspired him to come up with his own historical epic. The original three-hour long theatre version <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> in the North, directed by John Caird and featuring Jim Broadbent and Roger Allam among the cast, was produced by the RSC in 1982. It initially ran for a week at The Other Place in Stratford before touring to the city in which it was set, Newcastle upon Tyne, and then playing at The Pit, a studio theatre in the Barbican Centre in London. In its original form, the story went up only to the 1979 general election and the coming to power of the new Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. The play also contained a significant number of scenes set in Rhodesia, chronicling UDI, the oil embargo and the emergence of armed resistance to white supremacy. This plot strand was dropped from the televised version, although the title Our Friends in the North, a reference to how staff at BP in South Africa referred to the Rhodesian government of Ian Smith, remained.|$|E

The security of all waterways is vital to peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region, and we applaud the ongoing efforts of regional nations in combating maritime threats. Additionally, we feel that personal relationships built during these types of opportunities are mutually beneficial.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> in the North, Flannery {{proposed}} a [...] "kind of prequel" [...] to the serial {{under the title}} <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> in the South. This would have {{told the story of}} the Jarrow March. Although the BBC initially took up the project, it did not progress to script stage and was eventually abandoned.|$|E
500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Gavin Bowden, was first released December 7, 2000 on Vh1.com. It {{served as an}} official video for the song, after an unofficial version was released by DreamWorks as a [...] "temporary video" [...] that was played on MTV2. In an interview with MTV Radio, Wade explained {{the process of making}} the music video, and said, [...] "We shot the video at this really cool place in Crenshaw, in L.A., that was a bowling alley upstairs and a roller rink downstairs. It had this really weird, retro vibe to it. When they were setting up the different sets, we'd have to stop every 10 seconds because a bowling league would walk in. It was the coolest thing. At night, we got all <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>friends</b> to come down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] we breathed, sadly, at {{the sight}} of the wilted {{offering}} in the hands <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>friend.</b> [...] "What is it he won't take now?" ...|$|R

500|$|Contemporary {{popular music}} was used {{throughout}} the production to evoke {{the feel of the}} year in which each episode was set. The BBC's existing agreements with various music publishers and record labels meant that the production team was easily able to obtain the rights to use most of the desired songs. A particular piece of synchronicity occurred in the final episode, 1995, which Cellan Jones had decided to close with the song [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger" [...] by Oasis. While the serial was in production, it was just another track from their (What's the Story) Morning Glory? album. However, during transmission <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> in the North, it was released as a single, and to Cellan Jones's delight, it {{was at the top of}} the UK Singles Chart in the week of the final episode's transmission.|$|E
500|$|By 1989, Wearing {{had been}} {{recalled}} {{to the central}} BBC drama department in London where he was made Head of Serials. This new seniority eventually allowed him to further the cause <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> in the North. Flannery wrote to the BBC's then Managing Director of Television, Will Wyatt, [...] "accusing him of cowardice for not approving it." [...] The BBC was concerned {{not only with the}} budget and resources that would be required to produce the serial, but also with potential legal issues. Much of the background story was based on real-life events and people, such as Smith and Poulson and former Home Secretary Reginald Maudling, upon whom another character, Claud Seabrook, was based. According to The Observer newspaper, one senior BBC lawyer, Glen Del Medico, even threatened to resign if the production was made. Others tried to persuade Flannery to reset the piece [...] "in a fictional country called Albion rather than Britain." [...] Both Smith and Poulson died before the programme aired.|$|E
500|$|The {{conclusion}} of the serial in March brought similar praise. [...] "Our Friends in the North confounded the gloomier predictions about its content and proved {{that there was an}} audience for political material, provided that it found its way to the screen through lives imagined in emotional detail... It will be remembered for an intimate sense of character, powerful enough to make you forgive its faults and stay loyal to the end," [...] was the verdict of The Independent on the final episode. Writing in the same newspaper the following day, Jeffrey Richards added that [...] "Monday night's final episode <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> in the North has left many people bereft. The serial captivated much of the country, sketching a panoramic view of life in Britain from the sixties to the nineties... At once sweeping and intimate, both moving and angry, simultaneously historical and contemporary, it has followed in the distinguished footsteps of BBC series such as Boys from the Blackstuff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must all}} {{sympathize with the}} sincerity and {{to a certain extent}} with the {{intention}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>friend</b> {{in the body of the}} hall. But we must ask ourselves: ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Walk the Line" [...] is {{darker than}} the other songs on the album, and {{according}} to Johnson [...] "is inspired lyrically by the tragic loss <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>friend</b> Tim Saunders".|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold your hands, men!" [...] shouted Gunrig. [...] "I {{know that}} voice--ay, {{and the face}} too. Is it not the white beard <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>friend</b> the Hebrew that I see?" ...|$|R
500|$|The stage version <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> in the North {{was seen}} by BBC {{television}} drama producer Michael Wearing in Newcastle in 1982, and he was immediately keen on producing a television adaptation. At that time, Wearing was based at the BBC English Regions Drama Department at BBC Birmingham, which had a specific remit for making [...] "regional drama", and had established his reputation by producing Alan Bleasdale's Boys from the Blackstuff in 1982. Wearing initially approached Flannery to adapt his play into a four-part television serial for BBC Two, with each episode being 50 minutes long and the Rhodesian strand dropped for practical reasons. A change of executives meant that the project did not reach production, however, Wearing persisted {{in trying to get}} it commissioned. Flannery extended the serial to six episodes, one for each United Kingdom general election from 1964 to 1979. However, by this point in the mid-1980s, Michael Grade was Director of Programmes for BBC Television, and he had no interest in the project.|$|E
2500|$|Since the beginning, the CIA {{has been}} {{suspected}} of involvement. After the incident, Ali Kocaman, {{chair of the}} trade union Oleyis, stated that police officers and Americans {{had been in the}} Intercontinental Hotel that had been closed to the public for that day. Bülent Uluer, the then Secretary General of the Revolutionary Youth Federation (...) said on 2 May 1977: [...] "Most victims were among us. About 15 <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>friends</b> died. This was a plan of the CIA, but not the beginning nor the end. To solve these incidents, one has to look at it from the angle." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 17 September 1950, India officially {{recognised}} the State of Israel. Following India's {{recognition of}} Israel, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru stated, [...] "we would have [...] long ago, because Israel is a fact. We refrained {{because of our}} desire not to offend the sentiments <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>friends</b> in the Arab countries." [...] In 1953, Israel was permitted to open a consulate in Bombay (now Mumbai). However, the Nehru government {{did not want to}} pursue full diplomatic relations with Israel as it supported the Palestinian cause, and believed that permitting Israel to open an embassy in New Delhi would damage relations with the Arab world.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't you {{see that}} what he wanted was to get rid <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>friend</b> Hamilton by dodging {{him in front of}} you for that job? That would have removed him for good. See?" ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2005, Joey Daub {{informed}} on {{his website}} joeydaub.com {{that he had}} begun writing new Believer material with Bachman. This announcement was reported widely, most notably through Blabbermouth.net, which called Believer a [...] "much missed late 80s and early 90s technical thrash metal band." [...] In an interview, Bachman explained that he {{moved closer to the}} studio near where Joey Daub lives. Daub was working on mixing Fountain of Tears' new album and invited Bachman to help: [...] "We just got together and started playing and having fun," [...] Bachman stated, [...] "nothing serious, but the chemistry was still there and stuff started clicking. We wrote some tunes, played them for some people and then some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>friends</b> in the industry said 'you guys should put this out, maybe there’s one or two Believer fans still out there that wouldn’t mind hearing it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|With their {{previous}} contract with Warner Bros. Records having expired in 2011, the band re-signed to Warner Bros. for the United States and to Bella Union in Europe in early 2012. The first release under these new deals was The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends, initially released as a limited edition vinyl-only package for Record Store Day on April 21. The album features collaborations with {{artists such as}} Kesha, Nick Cave, and Erykah Badu. In an interview with American Songwriter, Coyne stated that [...] "Since we were releasing music every month, {{we thought it would}} be a little bit boring for us each month to say 'Well here's four more Flaming Lips songs.' We just thought 'Well we'll get some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>friends,</b> and we'll do collaborations and see what happens.'" [...] The album later received a wider release on CD and digitally on June 26 in the US and July 30 in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{release date}} {{was once again}} pushed back to January or March 2005 while a final {{recording}} session was held in Mississauga, Ontario to re-record most of the songs {{that would make the}} album. During these sessions, guitarist Joel Shearer of the band Pedestrian visited with them and contributed his guitar playing to several tracks. [...] "He [...] came {{in the last couple of}} sessions to help us out and to get a little different guitar perspective on there." [...] Duncan Coutts explained, [...] "We had a couple <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>friends</b> that came and played. One guy, Adam, played a little B3, and Jason Lader played on that song. He was also our Pro Tools engineer for part of it—not the whole thing, part of it, doing Pro Tools editing. He played on a song that never made the record." [...] Coutts recounted the atmosphere of the final recording session. [...] "It was kind of like a musical community, like friends and musicians would stop by and people that were working there, part of the recording team. Bob sang vocals; Bob played guitar. Eric Helmkamp, Bob’s assistant engineer and Pro Tools engineer—he sang on some stuff. It was just about a musical team." [...] These sessions brought the whole project back into focus for the band, easing many of the tensions that had arisen earlier. According to Coutts, [...] "I don't know what would have happened if not for that time." ...|$|E
