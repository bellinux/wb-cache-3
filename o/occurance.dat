Daiļliteratūras tulkošana ir viena no inetresantākajām, bet arī sarežģītākajām tulkošanas jomām, jo, tulkojot daiļliteratūru, tulkotājam jāspēj atveidot ne tikai teksta pamatinformācija, bet arī emocionālās īpašības un mākslinieciskais efekts. Daiļliteratūras tulkotājam savā ziņā jābūt rakstniekam, jo viņa darbā nepieciešams tieši tikpat daudz iedvesmas, atjautības un talanta. Daiļliteratūras stilu visspilgtāk raksturo izmantotās stilistikas parādības. Autores maģistra darba mērķis ir identificēt stilistikas parādības kriminālromānā „Melno sapņu Deksters”, pētīt to funkcijas, kā arī to, vai tulkotājam ir izdevies tās veiksmīgi atveidot latviešu valodā. Darbā izmantota aprakstošā un analītiskā pētīšanas metode. Teorētiskās un praktiskās analīzes rezultātā autors ir apkopojis pētāmajā darbā biežāk izmantotās stilistikas parādības un to atveidojumus mērķa valodā un tādējādi var secināt, ka darbā sastopamas gan fonētiskās, gan leksiskās, gan sintaktiskās stilistikas parādības.

The {{author of}} the present master paper studies stylistic <b>occurances</b> in Jeff Lindsay’s book ‘Darkly Dreaming Dexter’. Translation of fiction is both {{one of the most}} {{interesting}} and one of the most difficult fields of translation because when you are translating fiction you have to not only render the basic information but also the emotional qualities and easthetic effect. In a way a fiction translator must also be a writer because his work needs the same amount of inspiration, wit and talent. Fiction is best characterized by the use of stylistic devices. The goal of this paper is to identify stylistic <b>occurances</b> in the crime novel ‘Darkly Dreaming Dexter’, to study their functions as well as whether or not the translator has managed to successfuly render them in latvian. The methods used in the present paper are descriptive and analytical method. As a result of the theoretical and practical analysis, the author has summarized the most common stylistic devices of the examined work as well as their rendtions in the target language un therefore can conclude that the book contains phonetical, lexical and sintactical stylistic <b>occurances.</b> The author can also conclude that the translator has not managed to find the balance between the rendition of the contents of the text and the stylistics.

However, instead of forcing the patrol routes to pass exactly in those locations, as would happen in a TSP, the proposed method uses the locations as density estimators for where the patrol effort should be placed.

We show the behaviour of the proposed method on artificial data, and then apply the method to some data from the Portuguese Navy, obtaining possible routes for its patrol vessels. I...|$|R
