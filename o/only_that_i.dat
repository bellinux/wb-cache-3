I can say <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wish there were more imitators -- we need them -- and that all imitations of so great an original must necessarily be inferior." [...] In a commentary for The New York Times Book Review, Frank Herbert, author of the science fiction novel Dune, also defended Brooks, saying: ...|$|E

Fear so intense that I remember nothing more, <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> stumbled out of the store in possession of what I knew I must have, a book as necessary to me as air... I found it when I was eighteen years old. It opened the door to my soul and told me who I was." ...|$|E

500|$|The lecture {{upon which}} Eureka was based also {{received}} negative reviews. Poe's friend Evert A. Duyckinck {{wrote to his}} brother that the lecture bored him to death {{and that it was}} [...] "full of a ludicrous dryness of scientific phrase—a mountainous piece of absurdity." [...] A local newspaper called it [...] "hyperbolic nonsense". though one publication, the Courier and Enquirer, called it [...] "a nobler effort than any other Mr. Poe has yet given the world". Audience members said it was not persuasive or simply too long. Even so, Poe considered Eureka to be his masterpiece. He believed the work would immortalize him because it would be proven to be true. In the Preface, Poe said: [...] "It is as a Poem <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wish this work to be judged after I am dead." ...|$|E
500|$|Priestley {{continued}} the educational projects {{that had been}} important to him throughout his life, helping to establish a [...] "Northumberland Academy" [...] and donating his library to the fledging institution.

[...] Of all of the religious works Priestley published in the United States, and there were many, it was his four-volume General History that was the most important. Stretching from 475 CE to Priestley's present, he tracked and explained what he saw as the history of Christianity and its [...] "corruptions", referencing his own An History of the Corruptions of Christianity (1772–74). However, he ended it by praising American religious toleration.|$|E
500|$|An {{enhanced}} remake titled Mega Man Powered Up — {{known as}} [...] in Japan — was released worldwide for the PSP in 2006. The game features a graphical overhaul with 3D chibi-style character models with large heads and small bodies. Inafune had originally planned to make Mega Man look this way, {{but could not}} due to the hardware constraints of the NES. Producer Tetsuya Kitabayashi stated that redesigning the character models {{was a result of}} the PSP's 16:9 widescreen ratio. The larger heads on the characters allowed the development team to create visible facial expressions. [...] "The concept for these designs was 'toys'. We wanted cute designs geared towards little kids ... the kinds of characters that you'd see hanging off of keychains and such," [...] character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa explained. [...] "Not <b>only</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> made sure to tell the designers not to skimp on any of the original Mega Man details. We wanted their proportions and movements to be accurately reflected in these designs as well." [...] As the size of the remake's stages are not proportional to those of the original, the widescreen ratio also presented the developers with more space to fill.|$|E
