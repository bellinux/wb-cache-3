40|$|We study {{dynamics}} of a nonlinear pendulum under a periodic force with small amplitude and slowly decreasing frequency. It {{is well known}} that when the frequency of the external force passes through the value of the frequency of the unperturbed <b>pendulum's</b> <b>oscillations,</b> the <b>pendulum</b> can be captured into the resonance. The captured pendulum oscillates {{in such a way that}} the resonance is preserved, and the amplitude of the oscillations accordingly grows. We consider this problem in the frames of a standard Hamiltonian approach to resonant phenomena in slow-fast Hamiltonian systems developed earlier, and evaluate the probability of capture into the resonance. If the system passes the resonance at small enough initial amplitudes of the pendulum, the capture occurs with necessity (so-called autoresonance). In general, the probability of capture varies between one and zero, depending on the initial amplitude. We demonstrate that a pendulum captured at small values of its amplitude escapes from the resonance in the domain of oscillations close to the separatrix of the pendulum, and evaluate the amplitude of the oscillations at the escape...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Galileo, in the XVII century, {{observed}} that the small <b>oscillations</b> of a <b>pendulum</b> seem to have constant period. In fact, the Taylor expansion of the period map of the pendulum is constant up to second order in the initial angular velocity around the stable equilibrium. It is well known that, for small <b>oscillations</b> of the <b>pendulum</b> and small intervals of time, {{the dynamics of the}} pendulum can be approximated by the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. We study the dynamics of a family of mechanical systems that includes the pendulum at small neighbourhoods of the equilibrium but after long intervals of time so that the second order term of the period map can no longer be neglected. We analyze such dynamical behaviour through a renormalization scheme acting on the dynamics of this family of mechanical systems. The main theorem states that the asymptotic limit of this renormalization scheme is universal: it is the same for all the elements in the considered class of mechanical systems. As a consequence, we obtain an universal asymptotic focal decomposition for this family of mechanical systems. This paper is intended to be {{the first of a series}} of articles aiming at a semiclassical quantization of systems of the pendulum type as a natural application of the focal decomposition associated to the two-point boundary value problem. 1...|$|R
