5|$|For most of Scott's {{tenure as}} governor, {{tensions}} between the U.S. and Great Britain escalated. Sentiment {{in favor of a}} U.S. declaration of war against the British was particularly strong in Kentucky. Most Kentuckians resented the replacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Embargo</b> Act of 1807 with the weaker Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 and Macon's Bill Number 2. Kentucky Senator Henry Clay became the acknowledged leader of the war hawks in Congress. During an address to the General Assembly on December 4, 1810, Scott expressed little hope of peacefully resolving U.S. grievances against Great Britain. He reminded the General Assembly, however, that France had also violated the United States' maritime rights and urged equal treatment of the two countries for their offenses.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln ran for {{election}} as governor {{in his own}} right in 1809, but he was perceived by moderate Federalists as overly partisan and lacked the charisma of Sullivan. His support for Jefferson's economic policy, particularly that of embargoing trade with Great Britain and France (who were then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars) was costly. Federalists, who had regained control of the Massachusetts legislature in 1808, attacked his statements in support of Jefferson, and he lost the election to Christopher Gore, amid a complete Federalist takeover of the Massachusetts government (the outgoing Jefferson administration's repeal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>embargo</b> before the election notwithstanding).|$|E

5|$|Utica's {{location}} on the Erie and Chenango canals encouraged industrial development, allowing the transport of anthracite from northeastern Pennsylvania for local manufacturing and distribution. Utica's economy centered around the manufacture of furniture, heavy machinery, textiles and lumber. The combined effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Embargo</b> Act of 1807 and local investment enabled further expansion of the textile industry. Like other upstate New York cities, mills in Utica processed cotton from the Deep South, a slave society. Much of the New York economy was closely involved with slavery; in the antebellum period, half of New York's exports were related to cotton.|$|E

50|$|Embargoed is a UK-based {{human rights}} {{organisation}} campaigning {{to bring an}} immediate and unconditional end to all <b>embargoes</b> against <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> Northern Cyprus.

It does not consider itself a nationalist organisation, and its manifesto commits it to being multi-cultural, and avoiding politics. The group also campaigns for 1964 to be recognised as <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>embargoes,</b> this being <b>the</b> year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breakdown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power sharing between Greek and Turkish Cypriots (see Cyprus dispute).|$|R
25|$|On 10 October 2006, the United States {{announced}} {{the creation of}} a task force made up of officials from several U.S. agencies to pursue more aggressively American violators of the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba, with penalties as severe as 10 years of prison {{and hundreds of thousands of}} dollars in fines for violators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>embargo.</b>|$|E
25|$|At present, the embargo, {{which limits}} American {{businesses}} from conducting business with Cuban interests, {{is still in}} effect and is the most enduring trade embargo in modern history.

Cuba must, however, pay cash for all imports, as credit is not allowed.|$|E
25|$|In 1981 President Ronald Reagan’s new {{administration}} announced a tightening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>embargo.</b> The U.S. also re-established the travel ban, prohibiting U.S. citizens from spending money in Cuba.

25|$|Western {{central banks}} decided to sharply cut {{interest}} rates to encourage growth, deciding that inflation was a secondary concern. Although this was the orthodox macroeconomic prescription at the time, the resulting stagflation surprised economists and central bankers. The policy is now considered by some to have deepened and lengthened the adverse effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>embargo.</b> Recent research claims that in the period after 1985 the economy became more resilient to energy price increases.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>embargo</b> imposed upon Palestinian belligerents—Jewish and Arab alike—and the dire lack of goods in Palestine, Soviet premier Joseph Stalin's {{decision}} to not {{adhere to the}} embargo and to support the country by exporting Czechoslovakian goods to it {{played a role in}} the war that was differently appreciated. However, Syria too bought from Czechoslovakia a quantity of arms for the Arab Liberation Army but the shipment never arrived due to Hagana force intervention.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the real}} impetuses for United States {{entering}} the Industrial Revolution was the passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Embargo</b> Act of 1807, the War of 1812 (1812–14) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803–15) which cut off supplies of new and cheaper Industrial revolution products from Britain.

Cuba also amassed substantial debts owed to its Japanese, European, and Latin American trading partners during the years of abundant Soviet aid.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson's {{popularity}} further {{suffered in}} his second term due to his response to wars in Europe. Positive relations with Great Britain had diminished, due partly to the antipathy between Jefferson and British diplomat Anthony Merry. After Napoleon's decisive victory at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, Napoleon became more aggressive in his negotiations over trading rights, which American efforts failed to counter. Jefferson then led the enactment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Embargo</b> Act of 1807, directed at both France and Great Britain. This triggered economic chaos in the U.S. and was strongly criticized at the time, resulting in Jefferson having to abandon the policy a year later.|$|E

25|$|Between 1954 and 1958, {{trade between}} Cuba and the United States {{was at a}} higher level than what it is today. 65% of Cuba's total exports were sent to the United States while imports from the U.S. totaled to 74% percent of Cuba's {{international}} purchases. After the formal implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>embargo</b> and the passage of Proclamation 3355, there was a 95% decrease in Cuba's sugar quota, which canceled roughly 700,000 tons of the 3,119,655 tons previously allotted to the United States. A year later, Cuba's sugar quota was reduced to zero when President Eisenhower issued Proclamation 3383. This substantially effected Cuba's total exports as Cuba was one of the world's leading sugar exporters at the time.|$|E
