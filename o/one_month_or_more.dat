Balinese funerals are very expensive and the body may be interred until the family can afford it or until there is a group funeral planned by the village or family when costs will be less. The purpose of burying the corpse is for the decay process to consume the fluids of the corpse, which allows for an easier, more rapid and more complete cremation.|$|E

The cases being studied consist of cases with no prior treatment and cases with history of <b>one</b> <b>month</b> treatment <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> Sputum AFB confirmation and susceptibility testing had done at Persahabatan Hospital and 10 % cross check at Laboratory of Microbiology University of Indonesia. A total of 226 cases out of 330 cases from 10 HCs, met the requirement of the inclusion criteria. More than 50 % of the cases were people of productive age. Among the study cases with no prior treatment 15. 2 % were resistant to at least 1 drug. Among the cases with history of <b>one</b> <b>month</b> treatment <b>or</b> morefefhe resistance prevalence to at least one drug was 4. 7 %. The total resistance prevalence at 10 HCs was 19. 9 % (38 cases). Total resistance to isoniazide (INH) was 15. 2 % and the multi drug resistance (MDR) was 4. 7 %. The conversion rate of all study cases was 59. 3 %, 70. 8 % completed the full course of anti tuberculosis drugs and 20. 8 % drop out. Among the resistant cases (38 cases), the conversion rate was 47. 4 % and 63. 2 % completed the full course.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} {{left ventricular}} dysfunction in patients who had been treated with anthracycline based chemotherapy.  METHODS—Autonomic function was compared with left ventricular diastolic function in 20  asymptomatic women with normal systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >  0. 50) treated for breast cancer with high dose anthracycline based chemotherapy, and 20  age matched healthy controls. Left ventricular diastolic function was assessed echocardiographically by measuring the early peak flow velocity to atrial peak flow velocity ratio, isovolumic relaxation time, and deceleration time. Heart rate variability analysis was assessed for time domain and frequency domain parameters.  RESULTS—The mean (SD) age of the patients was 45  (7) years and the mean LVEF was 0. 59  (0. 06). The time interval {{after the end of}} chemotherapy was 29  (27) <b>months.</b> <b>One</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> diastolic variables were abnormal in 50 % of the patients. Heart rate variability was abnormal in 85 % of patients. Mean values of both time domain and frequency domain parameters were decreased (p <  0. 05), in particular the parasympathetic indices.  CONCLUSIONS—Autonomic impairment occurs in a large proportion of asymptomatic patients with normal systolic left ventricular function after high dose anthracycline based chemotherapy. In particular, heart rate variability analysis may be a sensitive tool to identify the first signs of cardiotoxicity in these patients.    Keywords: anthracycline; cardiotoxicity; heart rate variability; echocardiography; chemotherap...|$|R

40|$|Differences in {{microbial}} {{fuel cell}} (MFC) architectures, materials, and solution chemistries, have previously hindered direct comparisons of improvements in power production due to new cathode materials. However, one common reactor design has now been used in many different laboratories around the world under similar operating conditions based on using: a graphite fiber brush anode, a platinum cathode catalyst, a single-chamber cube-shaped (4 -cm) MFC with a 3 -cm diameter anolyte chamber, 50 mM phosphate buffer, and an acetate fuel. Analysis of several publications over 10 years from a single laboratory showed that even under such identical operational conditions, maximum power densities varied by 15 %, {{with an average of}} 1. 36 ± 0. 20 W m– 2 (n= 24), normalized to cathode projected area (34 W m– 3 liquid volume). In other laboratories, maximum power was significantly less, with an average of 1. 03 ± 0. 46 W m– 2 (n= 11), despite identical conditions. One likely reason for the differences in power is cathode age. Power production with Pt catalyst cathodes significantly declined after <b>one</b> <b>month</b> of operation <b>or</b> <b>more</b> to 0. 87 ± 0. 31 W m– 2 (n= 18) based on studies where cathode aging was examined, while in many studies the age of the cathode was not reported.

40|$|Abstract One {{important}} {{task for the}} mental health services is to prevent suicidal behaviour, especially among persons at high risk, e. g. those who have attempted suicide. In two follow-up samples, <b>one</b> and three <b>months</b> after a suicide attempts, both n= 97, we found that 32 % and 38 % of the patients respectively had no treatment and 30 % in each sample had suicidal thoughts. In a randomised controlled study (n= 216) we investigated the effects of two telephone interventions in addition to ordinary treatment on attendance to treatment, suicidal behaviour and psychosocial functioning 1 - 12 months after a suicide attempt. There were no general main effects. Among patients who initially had other treatment than psychiatric attendance to such treatment was higher in the intervention group as compared to controls at 12 months. Further, subjects in the intervention group who had no initial treatment contact reduced certain psychological symptoms more than controls. In all patients an improvement in global functioning, psychological symptoms, suicide ideation {{and a reduction in}} number of needs were found, with no differences between the intervention and the control group. Initially needs were very common in health, basic and social needs. At follow-up, a significant reduction was found in health aspects, but not in social and basic needs. An analysis of predictive factors for repetition of suicide attempts during follow-up showed that reattempts within <b>one</b> <b>month</b> and three <b>or</b> <b>more</b> suicide attempts before the index attempt were highly predictive for repetition 1 - 12 months thereafter. It is concluded that telephone follow-up could be useful in patients without psychiatric contact. A special attention should be put to patients who make several suicide attempts...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{successful}} {{treatment of}} patients with active tuberculosis {{is one of the}} priorities in the Tuberculosis Control Programs. AIM: The aim was to establish whether there was a statistically significant difference in the treatment outcome in patients with tuberculosis who began their initial treatment phase and/or pursued it as inpatient, as opposed to patients with tuberculosis who underwent their entire treatment regime as outpatient. Moreover, our goal was to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in the outcome from the treatment between patients with tuberculosis who were hospitalized up to <b>one</b> <b>month,</b> two <b>months,</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> than two <b>months.</b> MATERIALS AND METHOD: The study includes 355 patients, divided into two groups. The first group, which consists of 219 patients, began their initial treatment phase as inpatient, and then they continued the treatment as outpatient. The second group, 136 patients, underwent their entire treatment as outpatient. The treatment outcome is determined with every patient (cured, treatment completed, treatment default, treatment failed, died, treatment in progress). For the statistical data analysis and for establishing the significance of the findings regarding {{the differences between the two}} groups we used the Pearson Chi-Square Test and the Yates Corrected Test. RESULTS: The statistical analysis with the Pearson Chi-Square Test showed that the treatment outcome does not significantly depend on the model of treatment (p = 0. 31). The statistical data analysis showed that there is no statistically significant difference in the achievement of conversion of the bacterial result of the sputum at the end of the initial phase of treatment regarding the studied groups (p = 0. 89). The statistical data analysis showed that the length of inpatient treatment affects the outcome of the treatment and that the difference is statistically highly significant (p < 0. 00005). CONCLUSION: There are no statistically significant differences in the sputum conversion and the treatment outcome among inpatient/outpatient with tuberculosis or outpatient only; however, the length of inpatient treatment is statistically significant regarding its effect on the treatment outcome...|$|R

40|$|In the {{epiphysis}} of long bones, {{different patterns}} of development of ossification processes {{have been described}} in different species. The development of the vascularisation of the femoral head {{has not yet been}} fully clarified, although its role in the ossification process is obvious. Our aim was to investigate ossification and vascular proliferation and their relationship, in growing rat femoral heads. Male Wistar rats aged ∼ 1, 5 and 8 wk and 4, 8 and 12 mo were used. Light microscopy frontal sections and vascular corrosion casts observed by scanning electron microscopy were employed. In the rat proximal femoral epiphysis, ossification develops from the medullary circulation of the diaphysis, quickly extending to the neck and the base of the head. Hypertrophic chondrocytes occupy the epiphyseal cartilage, and a physeal plate with regular cell columns is present. Starting from {{about the end of the}} third <b>month</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> points of fibrovascular outgrowth, above the physeal line, can be observed in each sample. They are often placed centrally or, sometimes, peripherally. The fibrovascular outgrowths penetrate deeply into the cartilage and extend laterally. At age 8 mo, large fibro-osseous peduncles connect the epiphysis to the diaphyseal tissue. At 12 mo, the entire epiphysis appears calcified with an almost total absence of residual cartilage islands. This situation differs in man and in other mammals due both to differing thickness of the cartilage and to the presence of more extensive sources of blood vessels other than the diaphyseal microcirculation, as supplied by the teres ligament and Hunter's circle. In young rats, subchondral vessels and the synovial fluid could play a role in feeding the ossifying cartilage. Later, a loss of resistance of the physis due to marked degeneration of the cell columns, and extensive chondrocyte hypertrophy permit fibrovascular penetration starting from diaphyseal vessels rather than neighbouring vascular territories, such as those of the periosteum and capsule...|$|R
