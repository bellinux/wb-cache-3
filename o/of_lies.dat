5|$|Brown began {{researching and}} writing Bodyguard <b>of</b> <b>Lies</b> in 1961. Most of the {{material}} is based on oral testimony from Second World War intelligence personnel, as well as records from the National Archives and declassified American records (although Brown says {{that most of the}} book was written before he was able to access the latter, in 1974). Brown wrote Bodyguard <b>of</b> <b>Lies</b> at a time when details of both cryptography and deception during the war were still classified. His attempts at research was resisted by the British and American governments; he was denied access to British war records and had to undertake considerable work to obtain US records via Freedom of Information requests.|$|E

Later, we show the equivalence of the category of smooth actions <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> group-groupoids on Lie groups and the category of smooth cov- erings <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> group-groupoids.

50|$|The mapping from Lie {{groups to}} Lie algebras is functorial, which implies that homomorphisms <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groups lift to homomorphisms <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras, and various {{properties}} are satisfied by this lifting: it commutes with composition, it maps Lie subgroups, kernels, quotients and cokernels <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groups to subalgebras, kernels, quotients and cokernels <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras, respectively.|$|R

50|$|The {{notion is}} closely related to that of a {{representation}} <b>of</b> a <b>Lie</b> group. Roughly speaking, the representations <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras are the differentiated form <b>of</b> representations <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groups, while the representations of the universal cover <b>of</b> a <b>Lie</b> group are the integrated form of the representations <b>of</b> its <b>Lie</b> algebra.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{demonstrate}} that the notions of derivative representation <b>of</b> a <b>Lie</b> algebra on a vector bundle, of semi-linear representation <b>of</b> a <b>Lie</b> group on a vector bundle, and related concepts, may {{be understood in terms}} <b>of</b> representations <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebroids and Lie groupoids, and we indicate how these notions extend to derivative representations <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebroids and semi-linear representations <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groupoids in general...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Non-abelian {{homology}} <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras with coefficients in Lie algebras {{is constructed}} and studied, generalising the classical Chevalley-Eilenberg homology <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras. The relation of cyclic homology with Milnor cyclic homology of non-commutative associative algebras is established {{in terms of}} the long exact non-abelian homology sequence <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras. Some explicit formulas for the second and the third non-abelian homology <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras are obtained. Using the generalised notion <b>of</b> the <b>Lie</b> algebra <b>of</b> derivations, we introduce the second non-abelian cohomology <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras with coefficients in crossed modules and extend the seven-term exact non-abelian cohomology sequence of Guin to nine-term exact sequence...|$|R
5|$|Body <b>of</b> <b>Lies</b> was Alexander Witt's first credit as a {{director}} of photography; he had collaborated with Ridley Scott on six feature films previously, beginning as a second unit camera operator on Black Rain (1989). He shot the film in the Super 35 format with spherical lenses, and explained that these lenses offer more flexibility for interior and night pictures than the anamorphic alternative. They used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 instead of Technicolor's OZ process, which did not perform well in tests in the Moroccan desert.|$|E
5|$|Bodyguard <b>of</b> <b>Lies</b> is a 1975 non-fiction {{book written}} by Anthony Cave Brown, {{his first major}} {{historical}} work. Named for a wartime quote of Winston Churchill, it is a narrative account of Allied military deception operations during the Second World War. The British and American governments resisted Brown's attempts to research the book. Many of the topics were still classified and he was denied access to British war records. The material {{in the book is}} predominantly based on oral testimony as well as some American records, declassified toward the end of Brown's research.|$|E
5|$|David Ignatius, a {{columnist}} for the Washington Post {{and the author of the}} book Body <b>of</b> <b>Lies,</b> opined that the CIA had become careless out of desperation. According to Ignatius, it would be obvious that the CIA would have been so eager to acquire knowledge about the location of Osama bin Laden that it would take every available opportunity to get information. Shoshana Bryen, a U.S. security expert, said that the bombing would make Israel and the U.S. wary in their future dealings with Jordan.|$|E
40|$|In this survey, {{we report}} {{on the state of the}} art of some of the {{fundamental}} problems in the <b>Lie</b> theory <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groups modeled on locally convex spaces, such as integrability <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras, integrability <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> subalgebras to Lie subgroups, and integrability <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebra extensions to Lie group extensions. We further describe how regularity or local exponentiality <b>of</b> a <b>Lie</b> group can be used to obtain quite satisfying answers to some of the fundamental problems. These results are illustrated by specialization to some specific classes <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groups, such as direct limit groups, linear <b>Lie</b> groups, groups <b>of</b> smooth maps and groups of diffeomorphisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show how central {{extensions}} <b>of</b> (possibly infinite-dimensional) <b>Lie</b> algebras integrate to central extensions <b>of</b> étale <b>Lie</b> 2 -groups. In finite dimensions, central extensions <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras integrate to central extensions <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groups, a fact which is due to the vanishing of pi 2 for each finite-dimensional Lie group. This fact was used by Cartan (in a slightly other guise) to construct the simply connected Lie group associated to each finite-dimensional Lie algebra. In infinite dimensions, there is an obstruction for a central extension <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras to integrate to a central extension <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groups. This obstruction comes from non-trivial pi 2 for general Lie groups. We show that this obstruction may be overcome by integrating central extensions <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras not to Lie groups but to central extensions <b>of</b> étale <b>Lie</b> 2 -groups. As an application, we obtain a generalization <b>of</b> <b>Lie’s</b> Third Theorem to infinite-dimensional Lie algebras...|$|R

5|$|Fowles's {{presentation}} of Sarah, {{one of the}} most enigmatic female characters in literary history, is also psychoanalytically informed. Fowles himself was interested in the psychology of men and women.The enigma of femininity, myth of masculinity, and impossibility of man-woman relationship are some of the crucial themes. Through Sarah's deliberate spreading <b>of</b> <b>lies</b> about herself and her relationship with Charles, Fowles brilliantly brings about the various aspects of femininity that has the potential to authenticate, threaten, and expose the vanity of the male subjects.|$|E

Directed by Ridley Scott, DiCaprio dyed his hair brown and wore brown contacts for the role, which he chose to pursue because he considered it a throwback to political films of the 1970s such as The Parallax View (1974) and Three Days of the Condor (1975). The film received mixed reviews from critics, and at a budget of US$67.5 million, became a moderate box office success, grossing US$115 million worldwide.|$|E

40|$|We prove a {{generalization}} <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>Lie’s</b> Theorems in {{the context}} of Lie-like algebras 2 −nd.
