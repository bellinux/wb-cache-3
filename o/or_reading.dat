5|$|Hans Asperger {{described}} common symptoms {{among his}} patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene {{has yet been}} identified, multiple factors are believed {{to play a role}} in the expression of autism, given the phenotypic variability seen in children with AS. Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, <b>or</b> <b>reading).</b> Most behavioral genetic research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism. There is probably a common group of genes where particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.|$|E

In addition, some television programming uses Jawi, such as announcements, advertisements, news, social programs, or Islamic programs.|$|E

5000|$|The CPU {{communicates}} {{with the}} VDC through an 8-bit bus. A pin {{controlled by the}} CPU separates this bus into two [...] "ports", a control port and a data port. To write <b>or</b> <b>read</b> a byte of video memory, the CPU first has to write two bytes on the VDC's control port to the VDC's internal address register. Next, the CPU performs the actual write <b>or</b> <b>read</b> on the VDC's data port. As a data byte is written <b>or</b> <b>read,</b> the TMS9918 automatically increments the internal address register. This auto-increment feature accelerates writes and reads of blocks of data. The control port {{is also used to}} access various internal registers.|$|R

The community organizes charitable events and volunteer meals. The festival is an occasion for moral reflection for many Hindus.

25|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{with tape}} leaders {{was that the}} sound recording or playback did not {{start at the beginning}} of the tape, forcing the user to cue forward to the start of the magnetic section. For certain applications, such as dictation, special cassettes containing leaderless tapes were made, typically with stronger material and for use in machines that had more sophisticated end-of-tape prediction. Home computers that made use of cassettes prior to the advent of floppy discs (i.e. Apple II, Commodore PET) were designed to not start writing <b>or</b> <b>reading</b> data until leaders had spooled past.|$|E
25|$|In compounds, okurigana {{may be omitted}} {{if there}} is no {{ambiguity}} in meaning <b>or</b> <b>reading</b> – in other words, if that compound is only read a single way. If okurigana occur after several characters (esp. both {{in the middle of the}} compound and at the end of the compound, as in 2-character compounds), either only the middle okurigana, or both the middle and the final okurigana may be omitted; omitting only the final okurigana but retaining the middle okurigana is rather unusual and somewhat questionable, though not unknown (marked with “?” below).|$|E
25|$|According {{to items}} of {{experiences}} involved, two subdivisions are made: general meditation, which aims at the mental assimilation of the Divine Truths (through philosophical thinking, hearing discourses from the Masters, <b>or</b> <b>reading</b> the written expositions of the Masters), and specialized meditation (meditation {{concerned with the}} object of experience, meditation concerned with the subject of experience and meditation concerned with mental processes), in which the mind is exclusively concerned with some definite experience it selects. In this system of classification are also mentioned two types of meditation of the Spiritually Perfect: Nirvana (or absorption) and the Nirvikalpa State (or divinity in expression).|$|E

25|$|In the {{language}} mode framework, language processing mechanisms and languages {{as a whole}} can be achieved to different extents. The relative activation state of language is called language mode, and it is influenced by many factors, such as the person spoken or listened to, users’ language proficiency, the nonlinguistic context and so on. Language users can be in a bilingual mode if they are talking to other bilinguals <b>or</b> <b>reading</b> text with mixed languages. However, if they listen {{to someone who is}} monolingual or is just speaking one language, the activation state would switch to a more monolingual mode. Based on this model, the bilinguals' language mode depends on {{the language}} users' expectation and by language environment.|$|E
25|$|According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study {{released}} in January 2009, 14% of Lakeland School District graduates required remediation {{in mathematics and}} <b>or</b> <b>reading</b> before {{they were prepared to}} take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years. Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.|$|E
25|$|When {{questioned}} about Ridgway after his arrest, {{friends and family}} described him as friendly but strange. His first two marriages resulted in divorce because of infidelities by both partners. His second wife, Marcia Winslow, claimed that he had placed her in a chokehold. He had become religious during his second marriage, proselytizing door-to-door, reading the Bible aloud at work and at home, and insisting that his wife follow the strict teachings of their pastor. Ridgway would also frequently cry after sermons <b>or</b> <b>reading</b> the Bible. Ridgway continued to solicit the services of sex workers during this marriage. He also wanted his wife to participate in sex in public and inappropriate places, sometimes even in areas where his victims' bodies were later discovered.|$|E
