5|$|A recent test <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>model</b> {{involved}} a reciprocal transplants of seedlings of 20 species of trees between clay soils (nutrient rich) and white sand (nutrient poor) {{to determine whether}} trade-offs between growth rate and defenses restrict species to one habitat. When planted in white sand and protected from herbivores, seedlings originating from clay outgrew those originating from the nutrient-poor sand, but {{in the presence of}} herbivores the seedlings originating from white sand performed better, likely due to their higher levels of constitutive carbon-based defenses. These finding suggest that defensive strategies limit the habitats of some plants.|$|E

Thus, we introduce the features <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>modeling</b> language by examples. We show that extensibility {{is one of the}} key features <b>of</b> <b>this</b> type <b>of</b> domain specific language and describe the principle idea of its implementation in the second part of the paper. ...|$|R

5|$|According to Walter Bolliger, {{development}} of the Floorless Coaster began between 1995 and 1996. In 1999, the world's first Floorless Coaster opened at Six Flags Great Adventure as Medusa. In 2009, the coaster was renamed Bizarro and re-themed. After the success of Bolliger & Mabillard's prototype Floorless Coaster, SeaWorld, Cedar Fair, Six Flags, and independent parks, Janfusun Fancyworld, Parque Warner Madrid, Tivoli Gardens, and Ocean Park Hong Kong have built other coasters <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>model</b> at their parks.

5|$|The first 747-100s {{were built}} with six upper deck windows (three per side) to {{accommodate}} upstairs lounge areas. Later, as airlines {{began to use}} the upper deck for premium passenger seating instead of lounge space, Boeing offered a ten-window upper deck as an option. Some early -100s were retrofitted with the new configuration. The -100 was equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3A engines. No freighter version <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>model</b> was developed, but many 747-100s were converted into freighters. A total of 167 747-100s were built.|$|E
5|$|The {{neutral theory}} of {{molecular}} evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes {{are the result}} of the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift. Hence, in this model, most genetic changes in a population {{are the result of}} constant mutation pressure and genetic drift. This form of the neutral theory is now largely abandoned, since {{it does not seem to}} fit the genetic variation seen in nature. However, a more recent and better-supported version <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>model</b> is the nearly neutral theory, where a mutation that would be effectively neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a large population. Other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution, such as genetic hitchhiking, also known as genetic draft.|$|E

5|$|The truck-mounted Katyushas were {{installed}} on ZiS-6 6×4 trucks, {{as well as}} the two-axle ZiS-5 and ZiS-5V. In 1941, a small number of BM-13 launchers were mounted on STZ-5 artillery tractors. A few were also tried on KV tank chassis as the KV-1K, but this was a needless waste of heavy armour. Starting in 1942, they were also mounted on various British, Canadian and U.S. Lend-Lease trucks, in which case they were sometimes referred to as BM-13S. The cross-country performance of the Studebaker US6 2½ ton truck was so good that it became the GAU's standard mounting in 1943, designated BM-13N (normalizovanniy, 'standardized'), and more than 1,800 <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>model</b> were manufactured by the end of World War II.

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{approach}} to Petri net modeling of programmable logic controller (PLC) programs is presented. The modeling approach is a simple extension of elementary net systems, and a graphical design tool that supports the use <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>modeling</b> approach is provided. A key characteristic of the model is that the binary sensory inputs and binary actuation outputs of the PLC are explicitly represented. This leads to the following two improvements: outputs are unambiguous, and interaction patterns are more clearly represented in the graphical form. The use <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>modeling</b> approach produces programs that are simple, lightweight, and portable.
