40|$|Introduction. One of the {{important}} sources of therapeutic and prophylactic agents of modern medicines are essential <b>oils</b> <b>of</b> medicinal plants. Essential oils are the main group of biologically active substances {{of a number of}} plants belonging to Lamiaceae Juss. Family. Antibacterial activity of medicinal plants belonging to Lamiaceae Family many scientists associated with containing <b>of</b> essential <b>oils.</b> In this regard, considerable interest presents the comparative analysis of the antimicrobial properties <b>of</b> essential <b>oils</b> <b>of</b> Lamiaceae Family representatives. Material and methods. The antimicrobial activity <b>of</b> essential <b>oils</b> <b>of</b> investigated plants was studied with using in vitro condition. The essential oils derived from the aerial parts of cultivated plants of Ocimum, Hyssopus, Dracocephalum, Lophanthus, Monarda and Satureja genus harvested during flowering period (in terms of Ternopil region). The antimicrobial activity <b>of</b> essential <b>oils</b> studied plants was studied by serial dilution method and disk diffusion assay. It has been applied on standard microorganism test strains: Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and Candida albicans ATCC 885 - 653. Results and discussion. It was conducted a comparative study of the influence <b>of</b> some essential <b>oils</b> <b>of</b> cultivated plants belonging to Lamiaceae family on microorganisms in conditions in vitro. It was found that essential <b>oils</b> <b>of</b> the studied plants were most effective in the maximum concentration (1 : 10). Gram-positive cocci S. aureus and yeast C. albicans were the most sensitive to influence <b>of</b> investigated essential <b>oils.</b> It was analyzed the relationship of the biological activity with the component composition <b>of</b> essential <b>oils</b> <b>of</b> plants. Essential <b>oils</b> <b>of</b> L. anisatus, M. fistulosa and S. hortensis characterized by the dominance of aromatic compounds and had shown stronger antimicrobial activity than essential <b>oils</b> <b>of</b> other species. Therefore, essential <b>oils</b> <b>of</b> these species are very promising source of antibacterial and antifungal drugs, especially in the treatment and prevention of skin diseases, upper respiratory tract inflammations and vaginitis. Conclusion. Obtained results indicate promising further study of antibacterial properties <b>of</b> essential <b>oils</b> <b>of</b> plants species L. anisatus, M. fistulosa and S. hortensis (Lamiaceae family). It was discovered that Gram-positive cocci, including S. aureus, and yeast Candida were the most sensitive to these oils. Along with the prospect of creating antimicrobial drugs which include essential <b>oils</b> <b>of</b> studied plants these oils can be recommended as active ingredients of preservatives in the composition of cosmetic products or dietary supplements also...|$|R

More than 1600 such organobromine compounds were identified by 1999. The most abundant is methyl bromide (CH3Br), of which an estimated 56,000 tonnes is produced by marine algae each year. The essential <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> the Hawaiian alga Asparagopsis taxiformis consists of 80% bromoform. Most of such organobromine compounds in the sea are made by the action of a unique algal enzyme, vanadium bromoperoxidase.|$|E
5|$|Nonpolar {{antioxidants}} such as eugenol—a {{major component}} of <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> cloves—have toxicity limits that can be exceeded with the misuse of undiluted essential oils. Toxicity associated with high doses of water-soluble antioxidants such as ascorbic acid are less of a concern, as these compounds can be excreted rapidly in urine. More seriously, very high doses of some antioxidants may have harmful long-term effects. The beta-carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) study of lung cancer patients found that smokers given supplements containing beta-carotene and vitamin A had increased rates of lung cancer. Subsequent studies confirmed these adverse effects.|$|E

Likewise, it became one of the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads competed fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company offering special deals to bulk customers like Standard Oil, outside the main oil centers.

Analysis of the plant's essential oil has identified over two dozen compounds, although the compounds detected and their relative prevalence have not been consistent. Most analyses have identified various monoterpenes and monoterpenoids as the dominant components, such as carene, eucalyptol, limonene, γ-terpinene, and (+)-β-thujone, although the essential <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> a sample from the Orto Botanico dell'Università di Torino had camphor as its most prevalent component. Other monoterpenes, camphene, α-pinene, and β-pinene are also present, as are sesquiterpenes such as γ-cadinene, δ-cadinene, trans-caryophyllene, and α-humulene. Several terpenoid alcohols—borneol, cedrol, and menthol—have been extracted from P.atriplicifolia, as have caffeic acid and ferulic acid.

In 1887, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission which was tasked with enforcing equal rates for all railroad freight, but by then Standard depended more on pipeline transport. More threatening to Standard's power was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, originally used to control unions, but later central to {{the breakup of the}} Standard Oil trust.

Kublai received the brothers with hospitality and asked them many questions regarding the European legal and political system. He also inquired about the Pope and Church in Rome.

Kublai Khan requested that an envoy bring him back <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> the lamp in Jerusalem. The long sede vacante between the death of Pope Clement IV in 1268 and the election of his successor delayed the Polos in fulfilling Kublai's request. They followed the suggestion of Theobald Visconti, then papal legate for the realm of Egypt, and returned to Venice in 1269 or 1270 to await the nomination of the new Pope, which allowed Marco to see his father for the first time, at the age of fifteen or sixteen.|$|E
