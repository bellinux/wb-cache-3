5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens {{to shoot the}} victim, but the victim is aware that the gun is not loaded or fake.

Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms <b>of</b> <b>assault.</b>|$|E

5|$|By late 1989, the Communist Parties of {{the republics}} of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania had largely been {{weakened}} in power. In Nagorno-Karabakh, the intercommunal relations between Armenians and Azerbaijanis had worsened due to violence and pogroms. Gorbachev's policies hastened {{the collapse of the}} Soviet system and many Armenians and Azerbaijanis sought protection by arming themselves with Soviet military weaponry. His preoccupation in dealing with the numerous demands by the other republics saw the disappearance of vast amounts <b>of</b> <b>assault</b> rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and other small arms munitions stored in caches throughout Armenia and Azerbaijan.|$|E
50|$|Individuals who are {{raped by}} strangers {{are more likely}} to {{acknowledge}} their status as a rape victim.

Acquaintance rape is highly prevalent and represents the majority <b>of</b> sexual <b>assault</b> cases. Therefore,a majority of victims are at an increased likelihood of being unacknowledged.|$|R

5|$|During the trial, {{the defense}} {{presents}} evidence that Deng {{was convicted of}} prostitution two years ago. Deng denies the charge and says she had been gang-raped by the soldiers who killed her husband.

The jury reached verdicts {{on two of the}} three charges, finding DiStasio guilty of unlawful imprisonment and not guilty <b>of</b> <b>assault</b> but deadlocks on the rape charge, and Benson says that he will likely serve a year in prison.|$|E

50|$|Estimating the {{prevalence}} of sexual violence in Finland is difficult, because a considerable number <b>of</b> <b>assaults</b> go unreported to the police. The several different estimates {{for the number of}} rapes occurring in Finland each year are based on research on the victims <b>of</b> the <b>assaults,</b> calls and contacts the Rape Crisis Center Tukinainen has received, and also from police estimates. For example, according to the Rape Crisis Center, they receive 1000-1200 calls and attempted calls each month. People have become more likely to report an assault to the police in recent years.In 2000, there were 579 cases of rape and 504 cases <b>of</b> sexual <b>assault</b> <b>of</b> a child reported. These numbers have increased significantly since then, and in 2013, there were 975 cases of rape and 1657 cases <b>of</b> sexual <b>assault</b> <b>of</b> a child reported. Younger people are at increased risk of violent victimization. The risk <b>of</b> physical <b>assault</b> is highest between the ages 15 and 34 years.|$|R
