50|$|With no {{modification}} to the microscope, i.e. with {{a simple}} wide field light microscope, the quality of <b>optical</b> <b>sectioning</b> is governed by the same physics as the depth of field effect in photography. For a high numerical aperture lens, equivalent to a wide aperture, the depth of field is small (shallow focus) and gives good <b>optical</b> <b>sectioning.</b> High magnification objective lenses typically have higher numerical apertures (and so better <b>optical</b> <b>sectioning)</b> than low magnification objectives. Oil immersion objectives typically have even larger numerical apertures so improved <b>optical</b> <b>sectioning.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>sectioning</b> is {{the process}} by which a {{suitably}} designed microscope can produce clear images of focal planes deep within a thick sample. This is used to reduce the need for thin sectioning using instruments such as the microtome. Many different techniques for <b>optical</b> <b>sectioning</b> are used and several microscopy techniques are specifically designed {{to improve the quality of}} <b>optical</b> <b>sectioning.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>sectioning</b> is {{underdeveloped}} in non-light microscopes. X-ray and electron microscopes {{typically have}} a {{large depth of field}} (poor <b>optical</b> <b>sectioning)</b> and so thin sectioning of samples is still widely used.|$|R
50|$|In certain cases, {{illumination}} by <b>optical</b> <b>section</b> {{does not}} yield sufficient information or is impossible. This is the case, for example, when larger, extensive zones or {{spaces of the}} ocular media are opaque. Then the scattered light that is not very bright normally is absorbed. A similar situation arises when areas behind the crystalline lens are to be observed. In this case the observation beam must pass a number of interfaces that may reflect and attenuate the light.|$|E
50|$|Observation with an <b>optical</b> <b>section</b> {{or direct}} focal {{illumination}} {{is the most}} frequently applied method. It is achieved by directing a full-height, hairline to medium width, medium-bright beam obliquely into the eye and focusing it on the cornea so that a quadrilateral block of light illuminates the transparent medias of eye. Viewing arm and illuminating arm are kept parfocal. This type of illumination is useful for depth localization.Direct focal illumination is used for grading cells and flare in anterior chamber by shortening height of beam to 2-1 mm.|$|E
5000|$|If media, {{especially}} {{that of the}} cornea, are opaque, <b>optical</b> <b>section</b> images are often impossible depending on severity.

To achieve specular reflection, the examiner directs a medium to narrow beam of light (it must be thicker than an <b>optical</b> <b>section)</b> toward the eye from the temporal side. The angle of illumination should be wide (50°-60°) relative to the examiners axis of observation(which should be slightly nasal to the patients visual axis).
