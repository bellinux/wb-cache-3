5|$|Maintaining {{the same}} {{interval}} {{of three years}} between Germanicus' and Drusus' first and second term as consul, Drusus was given the consulship again in AD 21, which he held with his father. The hardship {{of the last two}} years <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> had made him reclusive. For Tiberius, Drusus holding the consulship was a welcome sight, and with the state of his health, he retreated to Campania, leaving Drusus alone in carrying out the obligations of the consulship. Tiberius' retreat lasted about twenty months.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, {{while working}} on Ghare Baire (Home and the World), Ray {{suffered}} a heart attack; it would severely limit his productivity in the remaining 9 years of his life. Ghare Baire was completed in 1984 {{with the help of}} Ray's son (who operated the camera from then on) because of his health condition.

In 1987, he made a documentary <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> Sukumar Ray.|$|E

5|$|His father, Calvin T. Underwood, was a peach {{farmer in}} his home town of Gaffney who {{died at the age}} of 43 of a heart attack. The Underwoods lived in poverty, and nearly lost the farm when Frank was a child; to get a bank loan and avoid foreclosure, his father {{attended}} a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, of which the bank manager was a member. Underwood speaks fondly of his father in public, but this is a political ploy; in his asides to the audience, Underwood describes his father as a weak man who accomplished nothing with his life. He even urinates on his father's grave in season 3. Despite disliking his father, however, Underwood was influenced by him. Calvin was an abusive alcoholic and caused his wife and son years of misery. Underwood has said that when he was 13, he walked in <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> putting a shotgun in his mouth. Calvin asked him to pull the trigger, which he refused to do. He has stated that his biggest regret is not killing his father when he had the chance.|$|E

25|$|The Great American Ass was a {{critical}} failure, but despite Edson's complaint, better editing would not have disposed critics more kindly to the story he chose to tell. The book catalogs the pretentious and petty tendencies of the narrator's Puritan ancestors, focusing <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> as the main villain. Edson also ascribes these traits to his New York colleague Franklin P. Adams, exposing him as a Chicago native who adopted the tastes, dress, and accent of the Harvard elite only upon arrival in New York. Adams was a popular columnist {{at the time and}} {{one of the founders of}} the Algonquin Round Table.|$|E

Ezio uses it to overwhelm Cesare's forces and gradually withdraw the backing of his supporters; Cesare is finally arrested by Pope Julius II's Papal Army after Ezio and the Assassins confront him and kill his remaining followers.|$|E
