25|$|After {{receiving}} fresh {{information regarding}} Ottoman deployments on 10 April, Dobell modified {{his plan to}} incorporate a more flexible approach. While the first stage would remain unchanged, during {{the second stage of}} the battle he might attack directly by swinging his line slightly northeast, with only one division attacking Gaza to create a gap for Desert Column, depending on whether the hostile Atawineh defences were reinforced by units from the Hareira detachment. <b>Or</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> send most of his force to the coastal side of Gaza to make an attack there.|$|E
25|$|And {{upon their}} first {{introduction}} (as hath formerly been observed), though every man {{was obliged to}} pay tithes in general, yet he might give them to what priests he pleased; which were called arbitrary consecrations of tithes: <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> pay them {{into the hands of}} the bishop, who distributed among his diocesan clergy the revenues of the church, which were then in common. But, when dioceses were divided into parishes, the tithes of each parish were allotted to its own particular minister; first by common consent, or the appointment of lords of manors, and afterwards by the written law of the land.|$|E
25|$|Gordon's {{ideas on}} Sudan were radically {{different}} from Gladstone's: {{he believed that the}} Mahdi's rebellion had to be defeated, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> gain control of the whole of Sudan, and from there sweep over Egypt. His fears were based on the Mahdi's claim to dominion over the entire Islamic world and on the fragility of the Egyptian army, which had suffered several defeats {{at the hands of the}} Sudanese. Gordon favoured an aggressive policy in Sudan, in agreement with noted imperialists such as Sir Samuel Baker and Sir Garnet Wolseley, and his opinions were published in The Times in January 1884.|$|E

500|$|Emerson's first logo or {{stamp on}} these knives was [...] "Emerson Knives" [...] {{surrounding}} {{the outline of}} a Bowie knife; accordingly this {{is referred to as the}} rare [...] "Bowie Logo", appearing on only a very small number of knives. When a knife collector asked Emerson if he made Bowie knives, Emerson informed him that he did not. The collector then advised him to change his logo <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> confuse the knife-buying public, as they would ask for Bowie knives instead of linerlock folders. Emerson agreed with this assessment, dropping the knife outline and the word [...] "knives" [...] from his stamp, using just his name in a half-circle on the blade as a logo. This marking is known among collectors as the [...] "Half-Moon Logo" [...] and would appear again as a transitional mark between the Viper and Specwar lines of knives.|$|E
2500|$|So perhaps Mr Louch {{joined the}} Royal Navy, always likely given his home town?

[...] <b>Or</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have gone to India to make his fortune, for he does seem to have been quite well off during his later career, despite having had an {{apparently}} modest upbringing.|$|E
2500|$|... "La Llorona" [...] is Spanish for [...] "The Crying Woman" [...] and is {{a popular}} legend in Spanish-speaking {{cultures}} in the colonies of the Americas, with many versions extant. The basic story is that La Llorona was a beautiful woman who killed her children {{to be with the}} man that she loved and was subsequently rejected by him. He might have been the children's father who had left their mother for another woman, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been a man she loved but who was uninterested in a relationship with a woman with children, and whom she thought she could win if the children were out of the way.|$|E

2500|$|Patrons were few, {{and most}} had {{to compete with}} their peers to attract the best, most useful clients. Clients were many, and those of least {{interest}} to the patron had to scrabble for notice among the [...] "togate horde" [...] (turbae togatae). One in a dirty or patched toga would likely be subject to ridicule; <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>might,</b> if sufficiently dogged and persistent, secure a pittance of cash, or perhaps a dinner. When the patron left his house to conduct his business of {{the day at the}} law courts, forum or wherever else, escorted (if a magistrate) by his togate lictors, his clients must form his retinue. Each togate client represented a potential vote: to impress his peers and inferiors, and stay ahead in the game, a patron should have as many high-quality clients as possible; or at least, he should seem to. Martial has one patron hire a herd (grex) of fake clients in togas, then pawn his ring to pay for his evening meal.|$|E
2500|$|Body {{contact between}} runner and fielder is {{frequent}} in baseball, particularly at home plate. This is driven {{to a large}} extent by the manner in which a runner is put out. In both sports, rules prohibit interfering with runners. However, in baseball, the runner himself (or the base he is advancing to, if forced) must be tagged by a fielder holding the ball, to be put out. The catcher awaiting a throw will often stand between the plate and the runner. Once he catches it, the runner might try to go around the catcher, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> simply bowl the catcher over, if he thinks he can dislodge the ball by such contact; and if the catcher does not have the ball, the runner may still bowl the catcher over, which is considered fair because by rule a fielder without a ball cannot impede a runner. By contrast, in cricket, the stumps are the target for [...] "tagging" [...] rather than the runner. No contact with the runners is either necessary or allowed. Contact between opposing sides is rare, and is usually not deliberate. Violent contact between players was once even greater in baseball, as before the Knickerbocker Rules it was permitted in some versions of the game to literally [...] "throw out" [...] a runner by hitting him (or [...] "soaking" [...] him) with a thrown ball (in lieu of hitting a base or stake that would equate to cricket's wickets). This rule still exists in some versions of the baseball variant called kickball, which is played with a soccer ball and thus is much less injurious. Except when played batting in a hands-down position, kickball also calls for literal [...] "bowling" [...] of the ball, underhand, as with the old rules of both cricket and baseball. [...] "All 'round hands down" [...] kickball leagues exist, but in most of these, the ball is pitched with the face or shoulders.|$|E

60|$|Such as she was, Harry Gilmore's {{passion for}} her much {{astonished}} his friends. Those {{who knew him}} best had thought that, as regarded his fate matrimonial,--or non-matrimonial,--there were three chances before him: he might carry out their presumed intention of marrying money; <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> become the sudden spoil of the bow and spear of some red-cheeked lass; <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> walk on as an old bachelor, too cautious to be caught at all.
