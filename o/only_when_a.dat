5|$|Western jackdaws become {{sexually mature}} {{in their second}} year. Genetic {{analysis}} of pairs and offspring shows no evidence of extra-pair copulation {{and there is little}} evidence for couple separation even after multiple instances of reproductive failure. Some pairs do separate in the first few months, but almost all pairings of over six months' duration are lifelong, ending <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> partner dies. Widowed or separated birds fare badly, often being ousted from nests or territories and unable to rear broods alone.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, the District Court granted Apple's {{motion to}} dismiss for lack of Article III {{standing}} and failure to state a claim, but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, thereby not shutting out the claims permanently. The court ruled that without a showing of legal damages compensable under current law, the plaintiffs had not shown they sustained injury in fact by the defendants' actions. The problem facing the plaintiffs is {{the current state of}} electronic privacy law, the issue being that there is no national privacy law that provides for compensatory damages for breach of privacy, and this is the same issue faced by victims of data breaches, as breaches, per se, sustain no legal damages without a showing of actual and measurable harm such as monetary loss. Under U.S. law as of July 2012, it is <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> data breach results in actual loss as defined by applicable law that compensable damages arise. The case remained on the California court's docket as of July 2012.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, Alexander S. Douglas created OXO, a {{software}} program for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of tic-tac-toe. The EDSAC {{was one of the}} first stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35×16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human–computer interaction, Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game. The player entered input using a rotary telephone controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear on the screen, and then the computer's move would follow. The game was not available to the general public, and was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory, by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be moved. Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded. Around the same time, Strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer, the Manchester Mark 1, culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952, which had a CRT display. Like OXO, the display was mostly static, updating <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> move was made. OXO and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen.|$|E
25|$|Writer's cramp and musician’s cramp is a task-specific dystonia, {{meaning that}} it only occurs when {{performing}} certain tasks. Writer’s cramp is a contraction of hand and/or arm muscles that happens <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> patient is writing. It does not occur in other situations, such as when a patient is typing or eating. Musician’s cramp occurs <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> musician plays an instrument, {{and the type of}} cramp experienced is specific to the instrument. For example, pianists may experience cramping of their hands when playing, while brass players may have cramping or contractions of their mouth muscles.|$|E
