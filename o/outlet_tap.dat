In the BMT unit the filters eliminated the fungi from the water on day 1 but due to particles present in the water the filters occluded, which prevented further evaluations.

30|$|Before {{preparing}} {{coffee in}} the pots, the aluminum content of the coffee itself was determined. To this end, 1.5  kg ground coffee (3  ×  0.5  kg packets) {{was placed in a}} dry plastic tray that had been rinsed with tap water. The ground coffee was then stirred to homogeneity with a plastic spoon that had also been rinsed with tap water and dried. Care was taken when purchasing the coffee to make certain that all packets had the same batch number. After stirring, three samples of this coffee were removed to be used for determination of aluminum content of the coffee itself. All necessary laboratory equipment was rinsed with tap water before use in order to remove any residual aluminum contamination. Tap water was also used for preparation of the coffee. Thirty liters of tap water were stored in a PE canister with <b>outlet</b> <b>tap</b> that had previously been rinsed with tap water. Coffee was prepared in the aluminum moka pots in exactly the same manner as in the stainless steel pots: 12 -g portions of ground coffee were measured out with an accuracy of two decimal places into the strainer basket of the moka pot. The 150  mL water for brewing was drawn from the canister mentioned above through the <b>outlet</b> <b>tap,</b> measured in a graduated cylinder, and poured into the bottom chamber of the coffee maker. Coffee was prepared a total of six times in a row per moka pot. The brewing time was 7  min for all moka pots heated on an electric plate with a temperature of 270  °C. After brewing was complete, the coffee was left in the collecting chamber of the pots for 5  min before transfer to 250 -mL sample bottles for subsequent analysis. Allowing the coffee to stand before transfer served to let any particulate coffee to settle in the finished drink. Of the original 150  mL, aliquots of 100  mL were poured through a funnel into the sample bottles. This method assured that no residual coffee particles would find their way into the samples. The remaining {{coffee in the}} collection chambers was disposed of and the complete moka pots were rinsed three times each by shaking for 30  s. After the 5 th brewing cycle, the moka pots were washed in a standard household dishwasher for 22  min at 50  °C (normal wash cycle with standard household dishwasher detergent tablets). This treatment is specifically not recommended by the manufacturers of the pots and serves as a worst-case condition. Before the pots were reused, they were also rinsed three times each in tap water by shaking for 30  s in order to remove any residue from the dishwasher detergents and to assure that the conditions were the same as for the other brewing cycles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Microbial safe {{tap water}} {{is crucial for}} the safety of {{immunosuppressed}} patients. Methods To evaluate the suitability of new, reusable point-of-use filters (Germlyser ®, Aquafree GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), three variations of a reusable filter with the same filter principle but with different outlets (with and without silver) and inner surface coating of the filter encasements (with and without nano-crystalline silver) were tested. The filter efficacy was monitored over 1, 4 and 8 weeks operating time in a haematological oncology transplantation unit equipped with 18 water <b>outlets</b> (12 <b>taps,</b> 6 showers). Results The filtered water fulfilled the requirements of absence of pathogens over time. From 348 samples, 8 samples (2. 3 %) exceeded 100 cfu/ml (no sample ≥ 500 cfu/ml). As no reprocessed filter exhibited 100 % filter efficacy in the final quality control after each reprocessing, these contaminations could be explained by retrograde contamination during use. Conclusion As a consequence of the study, the manufacturer recommends changing filters after 4 weeks in high risk areas and after 8 weeks in moderate infectious risk areas, together with routine weekly alcohol-based surface disinfection and additionally in case of visible contamination. The filter efficacy of the 3 filters types did not differ significantly regarding total bacterial counts. Manual reprocessing proved to be insufficient. Using a validated reprocessing in a washer/disinfector with alkaline, acid treatment and thermic disinfection, the filters were effectively reprocessable and now provide tap water meeting the German drinking water regulations as well as the WHO guidelines, including absence of pathogens. </p...|$|R
40|$|Entry of contaminants, such as {{metals and}} non-metals, into {{rainwater}} harvesting systems can occur directly from rainfall with contributions from collection surfaces, accumulated debris and leachate from storage systems, pipes and taps. Ten rainwater harvesting systems {{on the east}} coast of Australia were selected for sampling of roof runoff, storage systems and <b>tap</b> <b>outlets</b> to investigate the variations in rainwater composition as it moved throughout the system, and to identify potential points of contribution to elemental loads. A total of 26 elements were screened at each site. Iron was the only element which was present in significantly higher concentrations in roof runoff samples compared with tank tap samples (P < 0. 05). At one case study site, results suggested that piping and tap material can contribute to contaminant loads of harvested rainwater. Increased loads of copper were observed in hot tap samples supplied by the rainwater harvesting system via copper piping and a storage hot water system (P < 0. 05). Similarly, zinc, lead, arsenic, strontium and molybdenum were significantly elevated in samples collected from a polyvinyl chloride pipe sampling point that does not supply household uses, compared with corresponding roof runoff samples (P < 0. 05). Elemental composition was also found to vary significantly between the tank tap and an internal cold tap at one of the sites investigated, with several elements fluctuating significantly between the two outlets of interest at this site, including potassium, zinc, manganese, barium, copper, vanadium, chromium and arsenic. These results highlighted the variability in the elemental composition of collected rainwater between different study sites and between different sampling points. Atmospheric deposition was not a major contributor to the rainwater contaminant load at the sites tested.

40|$|Higher Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Research in {{the field}} of {{rainwater}} harvesting and harvested rainwater quality has increased substantially over the past decade, as countries explore alternative water sources to supplement mains water supplies. Despite the increased interest in rainwater harvesting, there remain several gaps in the literature with regard to both external sources of contamination of rainwater tanks (e. g. atmospheric deposition), and components of the rainwater harvesting system (RWHS) itself. Previous studies have focussed either on relatively few study sites, low sample numbers, or have investigated only a handful of organic or inorganic contaminants. This research project comprised a relatively large number (41) of RWHSs located in eastern and southern Australia. Samples were collected from the available sampling points of RWHSs, including: a downpipe for the collection of roof runoff, a tap located close {{to the base of the}} rainwater tank (‘tank tap’), an indoor cold tap supplied by the RWHS, and an indoor hot tap supplied by the RWHS. Samples were then analysed for a range of organic and inorganic contaminants. A method was developed that allowed harvested rainwater samples to be screened for a large number of organic compounds from different classes, using gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (GC-MS). These compounds included fatty acids, sterols, phthalate esters, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Inorganic contaminants of interest included a suite of 26 metals and non-metals, analysed by high resolution inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (HR ICP-MS). A number of statistical comparisons were undertaken to determine whether organic and inorganic composition of roof-harvested rainwater differed significantly at the regional and individual site level. Organic and inorganic composition of roof-harvested rainwater was found to be highly variable, resulting in large standard error values. Roof-harvested rainwater samples contained organic compounds consistent with or indicative of biological debris and decay, faecal contamination from birds and small mammals, pollutants from atmospheric deposition and compounds leached from catchment surfaces. High variances meant that there were no significant differences in organic composition of roof-harvested rainwater at the regional level. Variations did, however, occur between urban, rural and industrial locations, and between RWHSs located in the same regions. This was assumed to be a result of differences in the micro-climates in which individual RWHSs were located, in addition to differences in individual system components (e. g. roofing / tank materials). Roof-harvested rainwater collected from sites located in industrial areas contained significantly higher levels of barium, copper and lead than samples collected from urban and rural areas (P< 0. 05). When inorganic composition of roof-harvested rainwater was compared between sampling points of all 41 RWHSs included in the large-scale study, only cobalt was found to differ significantly, with hot tap samples containing significantly higher levels of this element than tank tap and cold tap samples (P< 0. 05). However, a number of case studies were also carried out, in order to characterise potential variations in composition between sampling points at the individual site level. These case studies indicated that inorganic composition could indeed differ consistently and significantly between sampling points. Levels of zinc and manganese were elevated in roof runoff samples compared with samples from other available sampling points, from 1 case study site (Tank 7). This may have been the result of atmospheric deposition and/or leaching from roofing materials. In-tank processes such as sedimentation, flocculation, dilution and actions of biofilm bacteria may then act to reduce levels of these elements in tank tap samples and other outlets downstream of the storage tank. Many elements were lower in concentration in surface runoff samples compared with various sampling points for the stored rainwater at another case study site (Site E), suggesting that atmospheric deposition may not always represent the major contribution to the total contaminant load of stored rainwater. Copper piping was shown to contribute to levels of copper, and old PVC piping was shown to contribute to levels of lead, nickel and zinc in roof-harvested rainwater. Tank construction materials did not appear to significantly affect elemental composition of roof-harvested rainwater, when Aquaplate™, concrete and plastic tanks were compared. Levels of copper, zinc, lead and nickel were also shown to differ significantly between the tank <b>tap</b> <b>outlets</b> of 4 plastic RWHSs located on the same site and fed by the same roof catchment surface (P< 0. 05). Possible explanations for these site-level differences include variations in climatic factors such as temperature and time spent in full sun versus full shade, due to the differences in aspect of each of the RWHSs. Usage patterns may also influence elemental composition of harvested rainwater in these 4 rainwater tanks. Although studies investigating the quality of harvested rainwater have often been criticised for including too few study sites, large-scale studies were shown by this research to mask differences between regions, or sampling points, due to the high variability associated with harvested rainwater composition contributed by RWHS design, plumbing and construction. The end user of a RWHS exists at the individual site level. It is therefore at this level that contaminant sources and harvested rainwater quality are most important. Large scale studies should therefore be combined with several case studies, comprising replicate samples collected from all available sampling points, in order to accurately determine harvested rainwater quality and potential contaminant sources at the level of the end user. These case studies will ultimately provide guidance on RWHS design and maintenance optimisation, for the collection of higher quality rainwater, which can then replace mains water supplies for a greater number of uses...|$|R
