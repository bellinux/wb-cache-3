5|$|A {{struggle}} over {{the power of the}} purse brought Adams back into the political limelight. Traditionally, the Massachusetts House of Representatives paid the salaries of the governor, lieutenant governor, and superior court judges. From the Whig perspective, this arrangement was an important check on executive power, keeping royally appointed officials accountable to democratically elected representatives. In 1772, Massachusetts learned that those officials would henceforth be paid by the British government rather than by the province. To protest this development, Adams and his colleagues devised a system of committees <b>of</b> <b>correspondence</b> in November 1772; the towns of Massachusetts would consult with each other concerning political matters via messages sent through a network of committees that recorded British activities and protested imperial policies. Committees <b>of</b> <b>correspondence</b> soon formed in other colonies, as well.|$|E

In 360, Libanius invited Domninus to leave Beirut and teach {{with him at}} the rhetoric school of Antioch. Domninus {{apparently}} declined the offer, since later correspondence to him from Libanius, between 361 and 364, served as recommendations for law school candidates.|$|E

5|$|Adams and the {{correspondence}} committees promoted {{opposition to the}} Tea Act. In every colony except Massachusetts, protesters were able to force the tea consignees to resign or to return the tea to England. In Boston, however, Governor Hutchinson was determined to hold his ground. He convinced the tea consignees, two of whom were his sons, not to back down. The Boston Caucus and then the Town Meeting attempted to compel the consignees to resign, but they refused. With the tea ships about to arrive, Adams and the Boston Committee <b>of</b> <b>Correspondence</b> contacted nearby committees to rally support.|$|E

5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{became known}} to Western scholars {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>correspondence</b> between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library. Portions of the codex were collated by several scholars, but numerous errors were made during this process.

5|$|What {{had begun}} as a Salt Satyagraha quickly {{grew into a}} mass Satyagraha. British cloth and goods were boycotted. Unpopular forest laws were defied in the Maharashtra, Karnataka and Central Provinces. Gujarati peasants refused to pay tax, under threat of losing their crops and land. In Midnapore, Bengalis took part by refusing to pay the chowkidar tax. The British responded with more laws, {{including}} censorship <b>of</b> <b>correspondence</b> and declaring the Congress and its associate organisations illegal. None of those measures slowed the civil disobedience movement.|$|E

50|$|A table <b>of</b> <b>correspondences</b> is an esoteric {{table that}} lists purported magical, supernatural, occult, {{medicinal}} or similar advice {{in connection with}} the subjects being indexed.

A table <b>of</b> <b>correspondences</b> {{can be as simple as}} a list of colors and their associated magical properties. A more sophisticated examples might include multiple columns and indexes. For example, a summary of ritual advice by auspicious time and place might include: alchemical or symbolic formulae to influence plants, animals, spirits or deities. Although distinct from sympathetic magic, examples can be found in ancient Greek medical theory, (the four humours), and Traditional Chinese Medicine.|$|R

Texians elected delegates to the Consultation, which created a provisional government. The provisional government soon collapsed from infighting, and Texas was without clear governance for the first two months of 1836.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{was born}} in Boston, {{brought up in a}} {{religious}} and politically active family. A graduate of Harvard College, he was an unsuccessful businessman and tax collector before concentrating on politics. He was an influential official of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and the Boston Town Meeting in the 1760s, and he became a part of a movement opposed to the British Parliament's efforts to tax the British American colonies without their consent. His 1768 Massachusetts Circular Letter calling for colonial non-cooperation prompted the occupation of Boston by British soldiers, eventually resulting in the Boston Massacre of 1770. Adams and his colleagues devised a committee <b>of</b> <b>correspondence</b> system in 1772 to help coordinate resistance to what he saw as the British government's attempts to violate the British Constitution {{at the expense of the}} colonies, which linked like-minded Patriots throughout the Thirteen Colonies. Continued resistance to British policy resulted in the 1773 Boston Tea Party and the coming of the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Ahmad Maymandi's father, Hasan Maymandi, {{was from}} a town named Maymand in Zabulistan, a region known for its popular traditions about the mythological Iranian warrior Rostam. Hasan was the {{governor}} of Bust under Mahmud's father, Sabuktigin, whose kingdom was then a vassal state of the Samanids, who were the lords of Khorasan, and ruled much of the region through their vassals. During Hasan's governorship of Bust, Sabuktigin crucified him, an action which Sabuktigin later regretted. Maymandi was the foster brother and school-fellow of Mahmud, who was also from Zabulistan on his maternal side. Maymandi began his administrative career in 994 {{as head of the}} department <b>of</b> <b>correspondence</b> during Mahmud's governorship of Khorasan under his Samanid overlords. Maymandi was later promoted to chief accountant and head of the military department. He was also appointed as governor of Bust and Rukhkhaj.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between multiple cameras viewing {{the same scene}} may be discovered automatically by finding corresponding points in the two views and then solving for the camera geometry.

This paper presents a method for extracting a larger number <b>of</b> <b>correspondences</b> from an initial set <b>of</b> putative <b>correspondences</b> without any knowledge of the scene or camera geometry.

40|$|We {{study the}} formal {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>correspondences</b> <b>of</b> curves without a core, {{focusing on the}} case <b>of</b> étale <b>correspondences.</b> The motivating examples come from Hecke <b>correspondences</b> <b>of</b> Shimura curves. Given a correspondence without a core, we construct an infinite graph G_gen together with {{a large group of}} "algebraic" automorphisms A. The graph G_gen measures the "generic dynamics" <b>of</b> the <b>correspondence.</b> We construct specialization maps G_gen→G_phys to the "physical dynamics" <b>of</b> the <b>correspondence.</b> We also prove results on the number of bounded étale orbits, in particular generalizing a recent theorem of Hallouin and Perret.
