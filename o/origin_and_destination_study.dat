40|$|Social {{media and}} big data have emerged to {{be a useful}} source of {{information}} {{that can be used for}} planning purposes, particularly transportation planning and trip-distribution studies. Cities in developing countries such as South Africa often struggle with out-dated, unreliable and cumbersome techniques such as traffic counts and household surveys to conduct <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> <b>destination</b> <b>studies.</b> The emergence of ubiquitous crowd sourced data, big data, social media and geolocation based services has shown huge potential in providing useful information for <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> <b>destination</b> <b>studies.</b> Perhaps such information can be utilised to determine the <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> <b>destination</b> of commuters using the Gautrain, a high-speed railway in Gauteng province South Africa. To date little is known about the <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations</b> of Gautrain commuters. Accordingly, this study assesses the viability of using geolocation-based services namely Facebook and Twitter in mapping out the network movements of Gautrain commuters. Explorative Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA), Echo-social and ArcGis software were used to extract social media data, i. e. tweets and Facebook posts as well as to visualize the concentration of Gautrain commuters. The results demonstrate that big data and geolocation based services have the significant potential to predict movement network patterns of commuters and this information can thus, be used to inform and improve transportation planning. Nevertheless use of crowd sourced data and big data has privacy concerns that still need to be addressed...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we relax}} {{one of the}} general {{assumptions}} in the hub location literature by allowing routed flows between nonhub nodes. In hub networks, different flows are consolidated and routed via collection, interhub, and distribution arcs. Due to consolidation, some flows travel long paths despite closeness of their <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> <b>destination.</b> In this <b>study,</b> we allow direct flows by penalizing by a scalar factor of original cost of transshipment between these arcs. We present mathematical models for median, center, and set covering versions of the problem for single- and multi-allocation cases. We test the models with the CAB and TR data sets. We discuss the properties of established direct connections for different models by using another mathematical model where the number of direct flows is bounded and interpret the effect of changes in problem parameters. © 2015 by The Ohio State University...|$|R

[22] and Goldstone and Robert [55] {{studied the}} nature of {{collective}} behavior of human crowds in forming trail system patterns in the compound topology of <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> <b>destination</b> nodes. To <b>study</b> this phenomenon, they developed a software platform for tracking the virtual movements of the participants between several predefined nodes (i.e., destination points) in their virtual experiment. In this situation, a participant used the keyboard to navigate a virtual pedestrian in a virtual system to simulate the movement behavior of a real person in the real world. In this multi-user network game, a participant can observe his moment-by-moment movement {{as well as the}} movement tracks of other participants in the system. The designed virtual environment in this system was homogeneous, flat, obstacle-free and has a uniform surface that was constructed from a 150 × 100 grid to simulate the walking environment.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates at an {{aggregated}} (macroscopic) {{scale the}} effects of route patterns on a road network. Four main variables are considered: the production, the mean speed, the outflow and the mean travel distance. First, a simple network with heterogeneous travel distances between <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations</b> is <b>studied</b> by simulation. It appears that the mean travel distance is not only very sensitive to {{the changes in the}} origin-destination (OD) matrix but also to the internal traffic conditions within the network. When this distance is assumed constant as usual in the literature, significant errors may appear when estimating the outflow at the network perimeter. The OD matrix also modifies the shape of the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) to a lesser extend. Second, a new modelling framework is proposed to account for multiple macroscopic routes within reservoirs (spatial aggregates of road network) in the context of MFD simulation. In contrast to existing works, partial accumulations are defined per route and traffic waves are tracked at this level. This leads to a better representation of wave propagation between the reservoir frontiers. A Godunov scheme is combined to a HLL Riemann approximate solver in order to derive the model numerical solutions. The accuracy of the resulting scheme is assessed for several simple cases. The new framework is similar to some multiclass models that have been elaborated in the context of link traffic dynamics...|$|R

Integration as a Three-way Process - Immigrants, Countries of Emigration and Countries of Immigration as Actors of IntegrationThe fulltext pdfs are {{available}} upon request to migration@EUI. eu during the embargo period (until 6 October 2019) Recent developments in migration {{studies have shown}} {{how important it is}} to consider multiple actors, both at <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> <b>destination,</b> in <b>studying</b> migrants’ integration processes. In light of these developments, the INTERACT survey provides a new tool to research migrant integration. Its novelty lies in offering a cross-national approach to civil society organisations at both <b>destination</b> <b>and</b> <b>origin.</b> These organisations are taken as actors relevant for migrant integration in EU destination countries. Upon completion the survey gathered over 900 responses from organisations working predominantly (but not only) in employment, education, language and social relations. These organisations had different levels of reach, but their voices give us a better understanding of how they support migrants in their efforts to integrate in the EU. Although the exploratory character of the survey does not allow for generalisations about all civil society organisations, it sheds light on how these actors’ activities affect migrant integration between <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> <b>destination,</b> <b>and</b> how organisations perceive states of <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> their policies in the context of the day-to-day reality of migrant incorporation in the receiving society. In this methodological paper, we will present the survey’s rationale and structure, before moving onto a description of fieldwork and the challenges faced there. This paper will thus contribute to the multisite cross-national survey literature and map out migrant civil society organisations.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, {{there has been a}} renewed {{interest}} in remittances of international migrants, as their strong recent increase shed more light on the effects at both micro and macro level. The remittances not only contribute to the well-being of the receiving households, but are also a large source of external financing, second only to FDI. The remittances are particularly important for Romania as in 2010 it was on the 5 th place in the European top of emigration countries and on the 4 th place as remittance recipient country. Therefore the determinants of remittance behavior need to be better understood. Following increasing interest and significant public debate on migration in Romania, our paper examines the significance of selected economic and demographic factors associated with the remittance behavior of Romanian international migrants, as characterized by the propensity to remit and the amount remitted. In particular we address the question of the role played by the geographic distance, as potentially affecting the immigrants' ties with their homeland and consequently the remittance decisions. Our present work builds on a recent source of data on immigrant cohort resulting from an online survey conducted during August-December 2010. Respondents were asked questions on a variety of topics including income, employment, remittances, regions of <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> <b>destination,</b> graduated <b>studies</b> both in Romania and in emigration country, length of migration and intention to return to Romania. The final database consisted of 1514 Romanian immigrants from 55 destination countries. We developed several multivariate models to study the determinants of remittances by employing regression analysis. Among the main findings is that the geographic distance is not related to the remittances. Although contrasting with the existing literature, this result can be explained by factors such as modern instant communication and fast travel supporting very strong and resilient transnational links despite geographic distance...|$|R
40|$|Although walking {{has been}} {{considered}} as an important transport mode, pedestrian modelling has received little attention in either academic or practising circles. There is an increasing need for methods {{that can be used}} to help the planning, design and management of pedestrian traffic systems. This paper presents a nonlinear programming formulation of the dynamic pedestrian equilibrium assignment problem based on the following assumptions. The pedestrian traffic system in a congested urban area can be modelled as a capacitated network with alternative walkway sections. People in this pedestrian network make such decisions as selecting departure time and walking path between <b>origins</b> <b>and</b> <b>destinations</b> (OD). The <b>study</b> horizon is divided equally into shorter time intervals of 5 - 10 minutes each, for which the pedestrian departure time matrices are given by a logit formula. It is dependent on the predetermined departure time costs and the equilibrium OD walking costs. In the proposed model, a 'quasi-continuous' technique is adopted to smooth out the transitions of various variables between time intervals and to satisfy the first-in-first-out discipline. A heuristic algorithm that generates approximate solutions to the model is presented. The numerical results in a real network shows that the model and algorithm proposed in this paper are able to capture the main characteristics of the departure time and route choices in congested unidirectional pedestrian traffic systems.

50|$|The {{impact of}} {{foreclosure}} goes beyond just homeowners but also expands to towns and neighborhoods as a whole. Cities with high foreclosure rates often experience more crime and thefts with abandoned houses being broken into, garbage collecting on lawns, {{and an increase}} in prostitution. Foreclosures also impact neighboring housing sales on two levels—space and time. For any given time frame, foreclosures have a greater negative impact when they are closer to the property attempting to be sold. The conventional view suggested is that the increase in foreclosures will cause declines in the sales value of neighboring properties, which, in turn, will lead to an extension of the housing crisis. Another significant impact from increased foreclosure rates is on school mobility of children. In general, research suggests that switching schools is damaging for children, although this does significantly depend {{on the quality of the}} <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> <b>destination</b> schools. A <b>study</b> done in New York City revealed that students who changed schools most often entered a school with lower, on average, test scores and overall school performance. The effect of these moves on academic performance for individual students requires further research. Foreclosures also have an emotional and physical effect on people. In one particular study of 250 recruited participants who had experienced foreclosure, 36.7% met screening criteria for major depression.|$|R
40|$|We study road supply by {{competing}} firms {{between a}} single <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> <b>destination.</b> In previous <b>studies,</b> firms simultaneously set their tolls and capacities while taking {{the actions of}} the others as given in a Nash fashion. Then, under some widely used technical assumptions, firms set a volume/capacity ratio that is socially optimal, and thus the level of travel time or service quality is socially optimal. We find that this result does not hold if capacity and toll setting take place in separate stages, as then firms want to limit the toll competition by setting lower capacities; or when firms set capacities one after another in a Stackelberg fashion, as then firms want to limit their competitors' capacities by setting higher capacities. In our Stackelberg competition, the firms that act last have few if any capacity decisions to influence. Hence, they are more concerned with the toll-competition substage, and set a higher volume/capacity ratio than sociall y optimal. The firms that act first care more about their competitors' capacities that they can influence: they set a lower volume/capacity ratio. So the first firms to enter have a too short travel time from a social perspective, and the last firms a too long travel time. The average private travel time is shorter than socially optimal. Still, in our numerical model, for three or more firms, welfare is higher under Stackelberg competition than under Nash competition, because of the larger total capacity and lower tolls.
