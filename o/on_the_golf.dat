5|$|No.4 EFTS's {{strength}} as at 1February 1941 was twenty officers, 101 airmen, and sixty-two aircrew trainees. Two Tiger Moths collided over the Lakes Golf Club on 6April, killing the instructor and his pupil {{in one of}} the aircraft; the pilots of the other plane survived after crash-landing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>golf</b> course. Owing to urgent requirements to house elements of the United States Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA), No.4 EFTS was disbanded on 24April 1942, and its operations transferred to No.6 Elementary Flying School at Tamworth, New South Wales. No.4 EFTS's graduates included Clive Caldwell, who became Australia's top-scoring fighter ace of World WarII.|$|E

25|$|The Prime Minister {{became a}} target for militant suffragists as they {{abandoned}} hope of achieving the vote through peaceful means.

25|$|On March 27, the California Air Resources Board {{modified}} their regulations, requiring {{automobile manufacturers}} to produce 58,000 plug-in hybrids during 2012 through 2014.

On June 26, Volkswagen announced {{that they would be}} introducing production plug-ins based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golf</b> compact. Volkswagen uses the term 'TwinDrive' to denote a PHEV. In September, Mazda was reported to be planning PHEVs.

25|$|As {{they are}} not {{organized}} by the PGA Tour itself, certain events (such as the major championships) {{are not part of}} the overall broadcast contracts, but are broadcast under separate contracts with their respective organizers. CBS carries the Masters Tournament and the PGA Championship, the first and last majors of the year, over broadcast television, with ESPN serving as its Masters cable partner for early round action and TNT serving that role for the PGA Championship. As of 2015, as part of an agreement with the United States Golf Association, the year's second major, the U.S. Open, is carried by Fox Sports and is usually carried over broadcast television each day of the tournament. Beginning in 2016, The Open Championship, the year's third major, airs on NBC, with cable coverage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golf</b> Channel (previously, ESPN had carried the entire tournament).|$|E
25|$|Langston {{was twice}} {{threatened}} with destruction in the 1960s. In 1964, Washington, D.C., officials proposed closing {{the first nine}} holes of Langston Golf Course and building the Barney Circle Freeway on the land, but the National Park Service (which owned and managed the island at the time) refused {{to turn over the}} land to the city. In 1969, the city of Washington proposed closing all of Langston Golf Course and building extensive low-income public housing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>golf</b> course and the rest of Kingman Island. The National Park Service rejected that plan as well. Perhaps the biggest threat to the course was a study by the Park Service in the mid-1960s which called for a new federally owned golf course to be built at Oxon Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm (just over the District line in Maryland). This study showed that D.C. golfers would be better served by the new course, and that Langston should be closed. But by 1977, the Oxon Cove course had yet to be built, and the plan died.|$|E

500|$|Even {{though the}} Butcher brothers' farming {{operations}} continued until January 1911, {{the government began}} preparations for subdivision. John Hall was sent to Avondale in April 1910 to locate all improvements and draw subdivision lines following existing fencing where possible.

500|$|Leaf related poorly to {{both the}} media and his teammates, whom he tended to blame for his poor play. In a locker-room {{incident}} during Leaf's rookie year, he was caught on camera screaming [...] "Don't talk to me, alright? KNOCK IT OFF!" [...] to San Diego Union Tribune reporter Jay Posner, and was physically restrained by Junior Seau. He soon developed a reputation for a poor work ethic {{to the point of}} occasionally being found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>golf</b> course while the other quarterbacks were studying film. After Leaf's rookie season ended, Charger safety Rodney Harrison described it as [...] "a nightmare you can't even imagine," [...] adding: [...] "If I had to go through another year like that, I'd probably quit playing." ...|$|E

In 2005, Jordan talked to Ed Bradley of the CBS evening show 60 Minutes about his gambling and admitted that he made some reckless decisions. Jordan stated, [...] "Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it.

500|$|Based on {{his junior}} college {{performance}} and increased bulk, Mitchell was recruited by several major college programs, but he originally committed to John McKay at the University of Southern California. While <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>golf</b> course with University of Alabama coach Paul [...] "Bear" [...] Bryant, McKay casually {{mentioned that he}} had received a commitment from an Alabama native. McKay assumed that Bryant wouldn't be interested in Mitchell because he was black and Alabama had no black players on their roster. Bryant swooped in and recruited Mitchell aggressively. Although Mitchell originally was a bit nervous about the reception he would receive at Alabama, {{as well as the}} amount of playing time he could garner, his family encouraged him to return home and accept Bryant's scholarship offer. Besides his family's encouragement and Bryant's assurances that his race would not be a problem, Mitchell's opinion that Alabama's School of Social Work was one of the country's best was a big factor in his decision.|$|E
500|$|Wilbur Clark was {{the first}} to build a home <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>golf</b> course in the 1950s. Additional homes were added to the Desert Inn Country Club Estates from the 1960s on. During his {{ownership}} of the hotel, Howard Hughes built 100 residential units on the property. After Steve Wynn purchased the resort in 2000 and announced that the real estate was too valuable to leave as a golf course, homeowners were forced to sell their properties to Wynn and his property developer Irwin Molasky. Molasky bought homes closest to the golf course for $2 million each, and homes on the perimeter of the resort for $900,000 to $1.2 million each. The Junior League of Las Vegas convinced Wynn to save one house from demolition and moved it to a lot in downtown Las Vegas to serve as its headquarters. This was the Morelli House, designed by architect Hugh Taylor for Antonio Morelli, a [...] "rare example of modernist architecture in Las Vegas". The house was subsequently listed on the City and State historic registers.|$|E
500|$|Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV {{reviewed}} each mobisode. [...] "The Watch" [...] {{was called}} [...] "a fun couple minutes of character work", but [...] "relatively worthless".

[...] "King of the Castle" [...] was reviewed better than the previous two mobisodes and the reviewer noted that [...] "it's a testament to ... Fox and ...

[...] While Dahl [...] "always like what Juliet brings to the table", he thought that [...] "Operation: Sleeper" [...] "serves little purpose". [...] "Room 23" [...] was called the [...] "best mobisode ever". [...] In regard to [...] "Arzt and Crafts", Dahl wrote that [...] "Lindelof wrote this mobisode ... and as a result ... it has the best dialogue of any mobisode so far". [...] He commented that [...] "Tropical Depression" [...] is [...] "not totally superfluous, though the new information isn't very enlightening". [...] Dahl [...] "liked" [...] "Jack, Meet Ethan. [...] Ethan? [...] Jack", but decided [...] "that it's not 's best work". [...] Dahl wrote that [...] "Jin Has a Temper-Tantrum <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golf</b> Course" [...] is [...] "a nice little scene", but the reviewer pointed out an inaccuracy in the scene's golf gameplay. [...] When reviewing [...] "The Envelope", Dahl wrote that [...] "The people over at Lost have cheated a little bit ... it's still a pretty cool deleted scene". [...] After seeing [...] "So It Begins", Dahl was [...] "not entirely sure what to think" [...] because the reviewer liked [...] "showing the moments before the pilot began" [...] and [...] "doing a mobisode from Vincent's perspective, but adding a supposed-to-be-dead Christian to the mix is confusing".|$|E
