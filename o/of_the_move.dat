5|$|Galbraith, Eide and Kerestedjiants {{agreed to}} deliver the plan to Croatia and the RSK on 21 October, opposed by Owen and Stoltenberg. Owen also asked Vitaly Churkin to {{instruct}} his envoy to oppose the delivery. As instructed by Moscow, Kerestedjiants pulled out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> and Galbraith accused Owen of sabotaging the Z-4 Plan.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, the Museum of London {{revealed}} {{plans to}} vacate its Barbican site {{and move into}} the General Market Building. The cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> {{is estimated to be}} in the region of £70 million and, if funding can be achieved, would be complete by 2021.|$|E
5|$|The Electronic Frontier Foundation {{acknowledged}} that the companies were within their legal rights to terminate their contracts with The Daily Stormer, but that the move set a dangerous precedent in which other political views including left-wing ones could be denied legal protection. Several news outlets also published editorials discussing the free speech implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move.</b>|$|E

5|$|The palace was {{the first}} and most {{important}} structure to be erected at the new capital of Heian-kyō, where the court moved in 794 following Emperor Kanmu's order. The palace was not completely ready by the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> however—the Daigokuden was completed only in 795, and the government office in charge of its construction was disbanded only in 805.|$|E
5|$|After {{the cathedral}} in Gamla Uppsala was damaged by fire in 1204, the Chapter sought {{permission}} from the Holy See to move the building to a larger site. Pope Alexander IV granted this request in 1258 on condition that the name of Uppsala be maintained. At a meeting in Söderköping in September 1270, Archbishop Fulco Angelus and the cathedral chapter decided the site should be in Östra Aros. Formal authorization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> was issued in 1271 by Bishop Carolus of Västerås whom the Pope had appointed to oversee the case.|$|E
5|$|After this, the 22nd Brigade {{moved back}} towards the {{junction}} of Holland and Ulu Padan Roads. Moving while under heavy fire, the battalion established itself in its new position before 9:00am, but in the confusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> some men found themselves separated from the main body and cut off. In the afternoon, after the brigade position was reoriented to the west, the battalion was placed in reserve. The battalion's positions in the north, situated on the high ground, experienced heavy attack from Japanese aircraft and artillery, as the brigade—supported by Australian and British artillery—fought off two regiments from the Japanese 18th Division {{during the course of}} the night of 11/12 February.|$|E

5|$|Helene Bresslau Schweitzer {{was born}} to the Bresslau family on January 25, 1879 in Berlin. Her {{maternal}} family was of Jewish descent, but she was baptized into the Christian religion {{as a result of}} widespread anti-semitism. The Bresslaus moved to Alsace, France when she was eleven because of a new job opportunity for her father. Her father, Harry Bresslau, began working at the University of Strasbourg and eventually became chancellor. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> Schweitzer adopted French, becoming fluent rather quickly.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} match Rey Mysterio (managed by Jorge Paez), defended his WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Chavo Guerrero (managed {{by his father}} Chavo Guerrero, Sr.) During the fight, Mysterio {{performed}} a 619 on Guerrero, leading to an attack by Paez on Guerrero, Sr. The referee ordered Paez backstage. Both fighters wrestled inconclusively until Mysterio delivered a second 619. During the second sequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> Guerrero grabbed Mysterio's legs and achieved a position with his shoulders spread so as to win both a pinfall and the WWE Cruiserweight title.|$|E
5|$|Once in Adenau, the {{regiment}} dispersed to many {{villages in the}} area, while Colonel Middleton stayed in a large home in Adenau where the owners continued to live as well. During the stay in Adenau, the 47th continued with its training, building a rifle range, running combat problems, and practicing lessons learned from its recent combat operations. In early March 1919, after nearly four months in Adenau, the 47th was ordered {{to the area of}} Remagen on the Rhine. On the morning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> Middleton had breakfast with General Pershing's aide, Colonel George Marshall, who had come to Adenau the day before to inform Middleton of his regiment's new orders.|$|E

5|$|The Daniels {{family moved}} to Indiana from Pennsylvania in 1959 when his father {{accepted}} {{a job at the}} Indianapolis headquarters of the pharmaceutical company Pittman-Moore. Then 11-year-old Daniels was accustomed to the mountains, and he at first disliked the flatland of central Indiana. He was still in grade school at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> and first attended Delaware Trail Elementary, Westlane Junior High School, and North Central High School. In high school he was student body president. After graduation in 1967, Daniels was named one of Indiana's Presidential Scholars—the state's top male high school graduate that year—by President Lyndon B. Johnson.|$|E
5|$|The ground {{has also}} held non-football events. It hosted a music concert in September 1979 and a grand {{fireworks}} display in October 1982 {{to celebrate the}} centenary of the Yorkshire Evening Press. Sporting events {{to have taken place}} include an American football match in the summer of 1988, and a rugby league match between York and Leeds in the Challenge Cup before a crowd of 11,347 on 29 January 1989, which was won 28–9 by Leeds. York City Knights have played at Bootham Crescent since 2016, ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> to the Community Stadium. Beer festivals, organised by the York Minstermen supporters' group, were held at the ground's social club from 2008 to 2012.|$|E
5|$|To {{accommodate}} {{members who}} had moved away from Jackson's downtown, in 1940 the congregation commenced {{construction of a new}} building on Woodrow Wilson Drive, while holding services at Galloway Memorial Methodist Church. The congregation moved into the new building in 1941, and dedicated it in January 1942. The sanctuary had solid walnut pews that sat 300. At the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> Beth Israel's old building at South State and South was the oldest building used for religious purposes in Jackson.|$|E

5|$|When a pawn {{advances}} to the eighth rank, {{as a part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> it is promoted and must be exchanged for the player's choice of queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. Usually, the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen, {{but in some cases}} another piece is chosen; this is called underpromotion. In the animated diagram, the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted to an allowed piece. There is no restriction placed on the piece that is chosen on promotion, so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than {{at the start of the}} game (for example, two queens).|$|E
5|$|When the NFL and AFL merged in 1970, the Patriots {{were placed}} in the American Football Conference (AFC) East division, where they still play today. The {{following}} year, the Patriots moved to a new stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which would serve as their home for the next 30 years. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> they announced they would change their name from the Boston Patriots to the Bay State Patriots. The name was rejected by the NFL and on March 22, 1971, the team officially announced they would change its geographic name to New England.|$|E
5|$|Andrić was {{appointed}} Yugoslavia's ambassador to Germany in late March or early April 1939. This appointment, Hawkesworth writes, shows he was highly regarded by his country's leadership. In 1934, Yugoslavia's King Alexander had been assassinated in Marseille. He was succeeded by his ten-year-old son Peter, and a regency council led by Peter's uncle Paul {{was established to}} rule in his place until he turned 18. Paul's government established closer economic and political ties with Germany. In March 1941, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact, pledging support for Germany and Italy. Though the negotiations had occurred behind Andrić's back, {{in his capacity as}} ambassador he was obliged to attend the document's signing in Berlin. Andrić had previously been instructed to delay agreeing to the Axis powers' demands for as long as possible. He was highly critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> and on 17 March, wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking to be relieved of his duties. Ten days later, pro-Western Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers overthrew the regency and proclaimed Peter of age. This led to a breakdown in relations with Germany and prompted Adolf Hitler to order Yugoslavia's invasion. Given these circumstances, Andrić's position was an extremely difficult one. Nevertheless, he used the little influence he had and attempted unsuccessfully to assist Polish prisoners following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939.|$|E

5|$|As {{the rift}} between {{the players and}} Brown and between Modell and Brown grew, Modell fired Brown on January 7, 1963. A {{controversy}} developed over {{the timing of the}} decision amid a local newspaper strike, which limited discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move.</b> A printing company executive, however, got together a group of sportswriters and published a 32-page magazine fielding players' views on the firing. Opinions were mixed; Modell came in for his share of criticism, but tackle and team captain Mike McCormack said he did not think the team could win under Brown. Blanton Collier, Brown's longtime assistant, was named the team's new head coach, and Brown began to plan his next move as he continued to receive an $82,500 salary under his eight-year contract.|$|E
5|$|Dual Destinies was {{the first}} game in the main series to be {{developed}} for the Nintendo 3DS; this move from the Nintendo DS to the Nintendo 3DS {{was the most difficult}} part of the development, with the development team being unsure of whether to use 2D graphics like with previous games or to use 3D models. Eventually they decided to use 3D graphics, because of the stereoscopic 3D effect being a selling point for the Nintendo 3DS system. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> to 3D, the in-house artist Takuro Fuse was in charge of the art direction, rather than the series regular Tatsuro Iwamoto, so that they could have meetings about the art more often. This was Fuse's first work on the main series, so he initially had problems with making character designs that fit the series, and had to get a lot of feedback from Eshiro. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, they put effort into the graphics, wanting to ensure that Dual Destinies graphics looked better than those of Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.|$|E
5|$|Having {{recognized}} {{one of the}} men {{living in}} the safe house as former small-time criminal Mustaffa Karami (Kais Nashef), Salaam takes Karami into the desert and coerces him into working for Jordanian intelligence, threatening to set him up as a collaborator if he does not co-operate. Hoffman asks Salaam to use Karami, but he refuses, believing a greater return will come later. Unknown to Ferris and Salaam, Hoffman tells Ferris' CIA subordinate (Skip) to follow Karami and kidnap him. Karami escapes and notifies the terrorists in the safe house that it is being watched, and they abandon it. Ferris's partner is caught and Salaam accuses Ferris of having had knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> on Karami, and blames Ferris's duplicity with him for the destruction of the safe house. He exiles Ferris from Jordan.|$|E
