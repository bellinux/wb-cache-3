We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this method on a solid-state ensemble system consisting of one electron and one nuclear spin. Comment: RevTeX 4, 8 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

Gas-to-wall heat transfer in the ullage is the dominant mode of energy exchange, with more than 50 percent of the pressurant energy being lost to tank wall heating in expulsions and the long duration pressurizations.

Surface analysis of the electrode surfaces indicated the presence on the tungsten emitter of only oxygen, carbon, and silicon.

Using tick-data for FTSE 100 futures, we show that normality is not always recovered by conditioning on the re-centered number of trades, and instead demonstrate that a non-linear function of the number of trades and/or volume will provide a better stochastic clock of the market. ...|$|R

40|$|With {{the launch}} of Gaia satellite, {{detection}} of {{many different types of}} transient sources will be possible, one of them being optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Using the knowledge of the satellites dynamics and properties of GRB optical afterglows we performed a simulation in order to estimate an average GRB detection rate with Gaia. Here we present the simulation results for two types of GRB optical afterglows, differing in the observer's line-of-sight compared to a GRB jet axis: regular (on-axis) and orphan afterglows. Results show that for on-axis GRBs, less than 10 detections in five years of foreseen Gaia <b>operational</b> <b>time</b> <b>are</b> expected. The orphan afterglows simulation results are more promising, giving a more optimistic number of several tens of detections in five years. Comment: 14 pages, 10 figures, accepted to PAS...|$|R
