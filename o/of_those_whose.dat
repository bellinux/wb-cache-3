5|$|Memories of {{more than}} a score of years of devoted service enhance the sense of {{personal}} loss which Miss LeHand's passing brings. Faithful and painstaking, with charm of manner inspired by tact and kindness of heart, she was utterly selfless in her devotion to duty. Hers was a quiet efficiency, which made her a real genius in getting things done. Her memory will ever be held in affectionate remembrance and appreciation, not only by all the members of our family but by the wide circle <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>whose</b> duties brought them into contact with her.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to racial}} {{segregation}} at the time, the coffins provided {{were used for}} the white victims, most of whom received a proper burial at Woodlawn Cemetery in West Palm Beach. The bodies of the African Americans who were killed and some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>whose</b> race could not be identified were disposed of by other means. Some were burned in funeral pyres, while many were placed into mass graves, including about 1,600 in Port Mayaca, 674 at the pauper's cemetery, at least 22 in Miami Locks (now known as Lake Harbor), 28 in Ortona, and 22 in Sebring. There were also unconfirmed reports of bodies buried at Loxahatchee. After the burials were complete, then-Mayor of West Palm Beach Vincent Oaksmith proclaimed an hour of mourning on October1 for those who died during the storm. A funeral service was hosted by several local clergymen and attended by about 3,000people, including educator Mary McLeod Bethune. A memorial was placed at Woodlawn Cemetery in memory of the victims of the storm, but no such marker was placed at the pauper's cemetery.|$|E

They cannot be verified to the minds <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>whose</b> field of consciousness does not include religious insight.

25|$|This slide led to {{the first}} {{fatality}} at the park, a head injury suffered in 1980 by an employee whose sled ran off the track; he then fell down a large embankment and hit his head on a rock, which killed him.

According to state records, in 1984 and 1985 the alpine slide produced 14 fractures and 26 head injuries. While park officials regularly asserted its safety, saying that 90-year-old grandmothers could and did ride it, {{in the early years}} of the park the slide was responsible for the bulk of the accidents, injuries, lawsuits, and state citations for safety violations.|$|E

25|$|With {{the final}} Incursion {{imminent}} during the Secret Wars storyline, Doom usurps {{the power of}} the Beyonders with the aid of Doctor Strange and the Molecule Man, collecting what he can of the destroyed multiverse and forming a new Battleworld consisting of different alternate realities. He also assumes the role of God and claims complete dominion of this new world and its inhabitants, controlling them into thinking he was always the almighty force of creation; he takes Sue as his wife, Franklin, and Valeria as his children, condemns the Human Torch to be the sun and Ben Grimm to be the Shield wall - he also rewrites his own history to resurrect the majority <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>whose</b> deaths he caused. Richards and a ragtag collection of heroes and villains that survived the destruction of all universes are able to challenge him and, with the help of Molecule Man, are able to take his power and restore the multiverse. Opting to heal rather than harm, Reed finally uses the Beyonder's power to heal Doom's face and fully turn him into a good man.|$|E
25|$|Philosophers, {{like all}} {{men at the}} time had to make ways of {{bringing}} food to the table. The most common occupation in the Byzantine Empire would have either been agriculturally based or earlier on in the Empire, trade based so this came about naturally through their own work. However Philosophers needed Patronage in order to live. The most important came from the Imperial court, especially before the destructive civil wars that were characterized by Andronikos III and his son John V. Other sources were from minor courts, from the rich and from the Church, if not from individual Church clergy. Of course, only Bishops had such resources. As the Empire descended into chaos, it could not spare any finances {{in its efforts to}} defend her borders and so the need to study in the fields of science and mathematics would have naturally disappeared from the minds <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>whose</b> lands were raided and seized. It would be this lack of Patronage that led to many of these scholars fleeing to the West. Remarkable travels were recorded by John Argyropoulos, Constance, Manuel Chrysoloras who between them all had travelled to Florence, Pavia, Rome, Padua and Milan. It could be said {{that the end of the}} Byzantine Empire coincided with the beginning of the Renaissance — what little influence the Byzantine Church had over Rome was more than made up for by their philological preaching and mass conversion to humanism.|$|E
