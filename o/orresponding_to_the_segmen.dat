Most importantly, reduplication or truncation that does exhibit right edge correspondence ii with the base must be compelled; in terms of edge correspondence, only left edge correspondence can function as the default. Second, violation of Marantz’s Generalization cannot be required merely in order to satisfy reduplicant alignment constraints.

The purpose of this research has been <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> requirements for providing banking products and services <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unbanked market segment and the challenges that the banks face in this regard. The research was qualitative and exploratory in nature. In-depth interviews were conducted with a sample of twenty representatives from retail banking institutions and institutions that provide research or consulting support in the banking industry.

SegMan is currently limited to operation in user interfaces for Microsoft Windows 95 / 98 / 2000 /XP. Internally, SegMan uses simple computational vision routines {{to pick out}} features {{of interest in the}} Microsoft Windows graphical interface. The basic architecture of <b>the</b> <b>SegMan</b> system has a dynamic-link library (DLL), which is able <b>to</b> capture <b>the</b> screen as a bitmap and then process the bitmap into lists of pixel groups. A pixel group is a region of the screen where all pixels are like-colored. All pixels on the screen are assigned to non-overlapping pixel groups. In Figure 2, in the diagram on the left, Group 1 is a pixel group composed of the pixels in the letter 'F'. Group 2 is the pixel group composed of the pixels in the dot. Group 3 is the pixel group composed of the pixels in the stem of the 'i'. Group 4 is the pixel group consisting of the background pixels. Pixel groups can be examined for specific shapes and for relationships between shapes. For shapes that consist of a single pixel group, such as the letter 'F', recognition is simple. One could either look at the arrangement of pixels within the group, or one could look at the pixel neighbour numbers. Figure 2. Pixel pattern...|$|R
40|$|Hedgehog {{proteins}} constitute one of {{the major}} classes of intercellular signals that control inductive interactions during animal development. These proteins undergo unusual lipid modiÞcations and signal through an unconventional transmembrane protein receptor that is characterized by a sequence motif implicated in sterol sensing. Recent studies suggest that the lipid adducts regulate the range and potency of the signals, whereas the sterol-sensing domain is essential for receptor activity. The role of inductive interactions in animal development has long been recognized, but only recently have the signaling molecules mediating these interactions been identified. Prominent among these are the Hedgehogs (Hh), a group of closely related secreted pro-teins encoded by a gene family originally discovered through <b>the</b> Drosophila <b>segmen...</b>|$|R

Context-dependent segment models and improved pronunciation modeling are shown to reduce word error rates in a telephone -based, conversational system by over 18 %, while the technique of Gaussian selection reduces overall computation {{by more than a}} factor of two. 1. INTRODUCTION Since its deployment in 1997 [1], the number of calls made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jupiter telephone-based conversational weather information system has been steadily increasing. Currently, an average of about 200 calls, yielding 1000 new utterances, are made each day. This continuous influx of real data {{from a wide variety of}} users and channel conditions is an invaluable resource for our research in robust speech recognition and understanding. In this paper we report on recent refinements in acoustic modeling which have improved performance, and reduced computational requirements. <b>The</b> SUMMIT <b>segmen</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|NHCH 3 (X = Gly 1, Ala 2, Aib 3, Leu 4 and D-Ala 5), {{have been}} {{investigated}} by Raman and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Solid state Raman spectra are consistent with β-turn conformations in all five peptides. These peptides exhibit similar conformations of the disulfide segment in the solid state with a characteristic disulfide stretching frequency at 519 ± 3 cm- 1, indicative of a trans-gauche-gauche arrangement about the Cα—Cβ—S—S—Cβ—Cα bonds. The results correlate well with the solid state conformations determined by X-ray diffraction for peptides 3 and 4. CD studies in chloroform and dimethylsulfoxide establish solvent dependent conformational changes for peptides 1, 3 and 5. Disulfide chirality has been derived using the quadrant rule. CD results together with previously reported nuclear magnetic resonance (n. m. r.) data suggest a conformational coupling between the peptide backbone and <b>the</b> disulfide <b>segmen...</b>|$|R
