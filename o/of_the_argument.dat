5|$|Critics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> include Averroes, who {{objected to}} its methodology, Al-Ghazali, who {{disagreed}} with its characterization of God, and modern critics who state that its piecemeal derivation of God's attributes {{allows people to}} accept parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> but still reject God's existence. There is no consensus among modern scholars on the classification of the argument; some {{say that it is}} ontological while others say it is cosmological.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 {{a team of}} Mayanists {{including}} Coe {{published a}} review of the evidence and presented further arguments in support of the authenticity of the document; in 2017, a critical review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> by Bruce Love concluded that the alleged codex's authenticity remains doubtful.|$|E

5|$|The frailty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> is that {{it implies}} that God, a being which does not suffer from transworld depravity by the {{assumption}} of omnibenevolence, is unable to recreate a transworld-depravity-free being, which is seemingly contradictory to the assumption of omnipotence.|$|E

5|$|All {{variations}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> from morality {{begin with}} an observation about moral thought or experiences and conclude with the existence of God. Some of these arguments propose moral facts which they claim evident through human experience, arguing that God is the best explanation for these. Other versions describe some end which humans should strive to attain, only possible if God exists.|$|E
5|$|Arguments {{about the}} {{taxability}} of compensation for personal services, whether called wages, salary, {{or some other}} term, may be either constitutional arguments as in United States v.

The rest of this section explains these arguments in more detail.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, even single neurons {{appear to}} be complex and capable of {{performing}} computations. So, brain models that don't reflect this are too abstract to be representative of brain operation; models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational resources. However, the Human Brain Project is {{trying to build a}} realistic, detailed computational model of the entire human brain. The wisdom of this approach has been publicly contested, with high-profile scientists on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument.</b>|$|E

5|$|Plantinga argued that, {{although}} the first premise is not rationally established, {{it is not}} contrary to reason. Michael Martin argued that, if certain components of perfection are contradictory, such as omnipotence and omniscience, then the first premise is contrary to reason. Martin also proposed parodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument,</b> suggesting {{that the existence of}} anything can be demonstrated with Plantinga's argument, provided it is defined as perfect or special in every possible world.|$|E
5|$|Some {{critics argue}} that Swift {{did not need to}} defend himself, and To Viscount Molesworth was written to gloat. However, the essence of the letter {{encourages}} the Irish to remember the actions of Walpole, Wood, and the British Parliament. By willingly throwing himself before the judgement of his fellow Irishmen and before the final judgement of God, the Drapier claims that he is and always will be on the correct side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument.</b>|$|E
5|$|The book {{produced}} {{a wide range}} of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation. The issues raised were complex and there was a large middle ground.

5|$|The {{extinction}} {{of the dinosaurs}} {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period is generally thought to have been caused by the Cretaceous–Paleogene impact event, which created the Chicxulub crater, demonstrating that impacts are a serious threat to life on Earth. Astronomers have speculated that without Jupiter to mop up potential impactors, extinction events might have been more frequent on Earth, and complex life might not have been able to develop. This is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> used in the Rare Earth hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} secrecy of the case, which was criticised by some {{contemporary}} observers, {{meant that it}} was not properly recorded or published, and the exact facts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> were not known for some time.

5|$|The {{limitation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> {{so far is}} that it only {{shows the}} existence of a necessary existent, and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped in Islam. An atheist might agree that a necessary existent exists, but it could be the universe itself, or there could be many necessary existents, none of which is God. Avicenna is aware of this limitation, and his works contains numerous arguments to show the necessary existent must have the attributes associated with God identified in Islam.|$|E
5|$|This {{contains}} {{the notion of}} a being that cannot be conceived not to exist. He argued that if something can be conceived not to exist, then something greater can be conceived. Consequently, a thing than which nothing greater can be conceived cannot be conceived not to exist and so it must exist. This can be read as a restatement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> in Chapter 2, although Norman Malcolm believed it to be a different, stronger argument.|$|E

The team found various sections of the game interesting, such as the references to Facebook and Halloween, as the characters are unaware of their meaning.|$|E
