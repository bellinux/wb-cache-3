40|$|A {{device for}} {{calibrating}} and testing echotomographic equipment comprises an electric motor, a pair screw-female, screw, wherein the screw {{is connected to}} an <b>outlet</b> <b>shaft</b> of the motor and the female screw is mobile With respect to a supporting plane, so as to transform a rotary motion of the motor shaft into a linear motion, a piston connected to the female screw and linearly mobile, coherently to the female screw, a membrane stressed by the piston, means apt to allow propagating ultrasound waves towards/from said membrane...|$|E
40|$|Lysholm-Smith torques {{converters}} has {{a special}} importance, {{due to the fact}} that this kind of machine can realize a continuously variation of the torque and of the rotational speed to the <b>outlet</b> <b>shaft</b> as function of the resistant torque and, in the same time, an amortization of the shocks and vibrations. This type of torque converter has three turbine stages, intercalated by two stages of reactors (having stationary blades). The present paper presents theoretical and experimental results obtained on a Lysholm-Smith torque converter CHC- 380 in the laboratory of Hydraulic Machinery Department from "POLITEHNICA" University of Timişoara, ROMÂNIA. Theoretical, was studied the behavior of the torque converter, expressed by the characteristic curves. Experimentally, was studied the variation of the temperature inside the torque converter with and without the cooling system and, also, the influence of the filling degree on the characteristic curves. The paper discusses, in the same time the definition and the variation of the degree of transparency for this particular torque converter...|$|E
50|$|The {{fuel supply}} to the fire was so rich {{that some of the}} {{combustibles}} were unable to find oxygen inside the tunnel with which to burn; they were instead ejected from vent shafts 8 and 9 as superheated, fuel-rich gases that burst into flame the moment they encountered oxygen in the air outside. At the height of the fire, pillars of flame approximately 45 m high rose from the <b>shaft</b> <b>outlets</b> on the hillside above.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This {{paper is}} an attempt to present the new concept of {{utilizing}} the exhaust generated from the two and four wheeler during the exhaust and through this system the recovery of the waste heat from the conventional commercial two wheeler and four wheeler is done. In this project a 125 cc engine bike is used and its exhaust manifold is coupled to the turbine inlet {{with the help of an}} injector nozzle and the <b>outlet</b> of turbine <b>shaft</b> is connected to the generator to produce electricity, this generated ac current is converted into dc and stored in the battery. Experimental analysis is done on the such designed and developed hybrid vehicle system and observed that the results which was better than the earlier developed systems...|$|R
