5|$|However, the Russian Army's {{transformation}} into a professional army was not deemed as successful. In September 2008, General Vladimir Boldyrev acknowledged {{that many of}} the professional soldiers did not have better training than the conscripts. Russian Airborne Troops and special forces conducted most of the land fighting. Due to the Russian Air Force's inability to penetrate Georgian air defence, airborne troops could not be airlifted behind Georgian lines. An ambush of a ground-troop commander, in which <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> thirty vehicles in his convoy survived, indicated intelligence and surveillance negligence. Many Russian land units reportedly had an insufficient ammunition supply.|$|E
5|$|<b>Only</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> the sieges {{resulted}} in a change of rule. Seven were fought between Muslims and Catholics during Muslim rule, four between Spain and Britain from the Anglo-Dutch capture in 1704 {{to the end of}} the Great Siege in 1783, two between rival Catholic factions, and one between rival Muslim powers. Four of Gibraltar's changes in rule, including three sieges, took place over a matter of days or hours, whereas several other sieges had durations of months or years and claimed the lives of thousands without resulting in any change in rule.|$|E

He was the {{youngest}} of fifteen children of Colonel Major Francis Downes—a British Army officer—and his wife Helen Maria, formerly Chamberlin, <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> whom survived to adulthood. After service in the Crimean War, Colonel Francis Downes served as commandant of the Colonial forces of South Australia and Victoria and retired with the rank of major general in the Australian Army in 1902.|$|E
5|$|The first {{uprising}} {{was supported}} by Duke Swietopelk II, Duke of Pomerania. The Prussians were successful at first, reducing the Knights to <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> their strongest castles. Conversely, the duke suffered a series of military defeats and was eventually forced {{to make peace with}} the Teutonic Knights. With Duke Swietopelk's support for the Prussians broken, a prelate of Pope Innocent IV then negotiated a peace treaty between the Prussians and the Knights. However, this treaty was never honored or enforced, especially after the Battle of Krücken at the end of 1249.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood {{and most of}} the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> the seven movements on that occasion.|$|E

5|$|Winston Churchill and {{his wife}} Elizabeth Drake had at least nine children, <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> whom survived infancy. The eldest daughter, Arabella Churchill, was born on 28 February 1649. John Churchill, the eldest son, was born on 26 May 1650 (O.S.). The two younger sons were George Churchill (1654–1710), an admiral in the Royal Navy, and Charles Churchill (1656-1714), a general who served on {{campaign}} in Europe with his eldest brother John.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Scheer sailed in October 1940 on {{her first}} combat sortie. On the night of 31 October she slipped through the Denmark Strait and broke into the open Atlantic. Her B-Dienst radio {{intercept}} equipment identified the convoy HX-84, sailing from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Admiral Scheers Arado seaplanes located the convoy on 5 November 1940, The armed merchant cruiser , the sole escort for the convoy, issued {{a report of the}} German raider and attempted to prevent her from attacking the convoy. The convoy was ordered to scatter under cover of a smoke screen. Admiral Scheers first salvo scored hits on Jervis Bay, disabling her wireless equipment and steering gear. Shells from her second salvo struck the bridge and killed her commander, Edward Fegen VC. Admiral Scheer quickly sank Jervis Bay, but the delay allowed the majority of the convoy to escape. The Admiral Scheer sank <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> the convoy's 37 ships, though a sixth was sunk by the Luftwaffe following the convoy's dispersal.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} members of its genus, C.cinnabarinum is {{generally}} considered inedible by field guides. Because the fruit bodies begin development underground, they are too tough for consumption {{by the time they}} are visible, and their appearance may be considered unappetizing. A study of the cultural practices of mestizo descendants of the Otomi people in Tenango de Doria, Mexico, reported that immature specimens of C.cinnabarinum, known locally as yemitas, were frequently eaten raw in the past, especially by children. Consumption of the species was no longer commonplace, with <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> the 450 locals interviewed familiar with the practice. The gleba of C.cinnabarinum has been described as having a mild taste and, despite a local recollection to the contrary, is not sweet. C.cinnabarinum has also been used in traditional medicine. A 1986 ethnomycological study of native traditions in Veracruz identified this use of huang noono, which locals roasted, then consumed as a powder with mineral water to treat gastrointestinal distress. Unlike these Mexican traditions, Hunan folk beliefs hold that the mushroom is poisonous on account of its bright color.|$|E

5|$|Examples of Beonna's coins {{are known}} from two {{separate}} hoards, {{as well as}} from a number of individual finds. Until 1968, <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> his coins were known. Several more coins came to light over the next decade, before a hoard of sceattas and other coins were discovered in 1980 at Middle Harling, north-east of Thetford and close to the border between the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. In all, fifty-eight coins have been excavated from Middle Harling, fourteen were found at Burrow Hill (Suffolk) and thirty-five from other places in East Anglia and elsewhere. Over a hundred 'Beonnas' are now known: most of them have been acquired by the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|Fishermen of the Canary Islands had {{to return}} to and remain in port for several days while {{weathering}} the storm, and this disruption was blamed for a 10–15% reduction of the islands' tuna catch. Tropical Storm Delta also had some further-reaching effects. The political opposition Popular Party challenged that the impact of Tropical Storm Delta proved the need for the island to prepare an emergency plan to deal with natural and man-made disasters. <b>Only</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> the island's many municipalities had an emergency plan, and there was no coordination across the entire island chain. Delta also served to highlight the islands' aging power grid, prompting the regional director general of industry and energy to consider building another power plant on the archipelago. The storm sparked a vigorous debate on the island about the effects of global climate change, how they will affect the islands, and how these effects can be avoided.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, forty {{prefabricated}} {{houses were}} built on adjacent {{land on a}} former holiday camp to rehouse residents {{of some of the}} most dilapidated properties. Despite winning several architectural awards and being praised by the local council, <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> the older properties were demolished. The original development along Brooklands has faced demolition, particularly with respect to dilapidated properties, and vacant sites nearby have been purchased to provide new homes. New permanent residences in Brooklands are prohibited by council regulations. Tendring District Council hope that by 2026, the area will change sufficiently to be attractive for development, and to provide a self-sufficient service based economy for tourism.|$|E

5|$|Pat Holland, an FA Cup {{winner in}} 1975 with West Ham, served as Millwall {{assistant}} manager to Willie Donachie in 2006. After Donachie {{was fired in}} 2007, he continued on as chief scout until 2009. In June 2011 former Millwall player Sam Allardyce was appointed as manager of West Ham. In June 2013 Millwall appointed former Hammers captain Steve Lomas as their new manager. Lomas joined ex-West Ham defender Tim Breacker, who was Millwall's first-team coach. As a former West Ham player, Lomas' appointment was unpopular with many Millwall fans. Lomas was sacked on 26 December 2013, after winning <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> his 22 games in charge.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the operation, {{a raid on}} the French {{coastal town}} of Dieppe had placed the German occupying forces on a high state of alert, and this {{ultimately}} contributed to Aquatint's failure. The commandos were also unable to identify their correct landing place due to the darkness. Within minutes of landing, the raiding party was ambushed by a German patrol and forced {{to try to reach}} their Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) transport. The MTB was located and engaged by the German shore batteries, which damaged one of its engines. It was forced to withdraw, leaving the commandos behind. At the end of the raid those commandos who had not been killed all became prisoners of war. <b>Only</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> the raiding force would survive the war; one was killed in captivity and the fate of the other two is uncertain.|$|E

5|$|Sixteen indictments were {{returned}} {{in connection with}} Goebel's assassination, including one against deposed governor Taylor. In May 1900, Taylor fled to Indianapolis, Indiana, and the governor, James A. Mount refused to extradite him for trial. Three others charged in the assassination turned state's evidence. <b>Only</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> the sixteen went to trial; two of those were acquitted. Three men were eventually convicted for playing roles in Goebel's assassination. Kentucky's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers, was accused of being the mastermind behind the assassination. Henry Youtsey, the State Auditor of Kentucky, {{was said to have}} aided the assassin. James B. Howard, a participant in a bloody feud in Clay County was charged with being the actual assassin.|$|E
5|$|The archdiocese assumed {{control of}} the orphanage in 1920, and began {{accepting}} orphans from the Juvenile Court of Cook County, most of whom came from broken homes whose parents did not pay the fines imposed by the court. This discouraged donations and strained the orphanage financially. Archbishop Samuel Cardinal Stritch, discovering that only 12 of the 255 children were actually orphans and <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> them were Slavs, closed the orphanage in 1956. The 12 true orphans were moved to Holy Angels Orphanage in Des Plaines. Bishop of Joliet Martin Dewey McNamara gave the former orphanage buildings to St. Procopius Academy, which {{was at that time}} still combined with the college.|$|E
5|$|The first airstrike {{attacked}} the ships of TF 16 which was initially defended by fighters from VF-6.

They {{claimed to have}} shot down a dozen Wildcats although the Americans lost <b>only</b> <b>five,</b> <b>of</b> which two belonged to VF-5; some of the American losses were reportedly due to friendly anti-aircraft fire. In turn, the American fighters claimed to have shot down 52 Japanese aircraft, 15 more than the Japanese committed to the attack.
