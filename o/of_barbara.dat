5|$|Moore's {{early work}} {{is focused on}} direct carving, in which {{the form of the}} {{sculpture}} evolves as the artist repeatedly whittles away at the block. In the 1930s, Moore's transition into modernism paralleled that <b>of</b> <b>Barbara</b> Hepworth; the two exchanged new ideas with each other and several other artists then living in Hampstead. Moore made many preparatory sketches and drawings for each sculpture. Most of these sketchbooks have survived and provide insight into Moore's development. He placed great importance on drawing; in old age, when he had arthritis, he continued to draw.|$|E

5|$|Various {{alterations}} <b>of</b> <b>Barbara</b> Gordon as Batgirl {{have appeared}} in storylines published {{in and out of}} mainstream continuity titles. Variants of the character within continuity often appear in stories which involve time travel, such as the crossover limited series , a follow-up story preceded by the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths which altered mainstream continuity. Notable imprints of DC Comics such as Elseworlds and All Star DC Comics have also featured alternate versions of the character.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on May14. After emerging into the eastern Pacific on May25, the system acquired enough organization {{to be considered}} a tropical depression at 1800UTC on May29, about 115mi (185km) south-southeast of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Within an environment of weak steering currents, the storm became better organized as evidenced by an improving satellite appearance, with the formation of a curved band in the southeast quadrant. At 1200UTC on May30, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm; by 0000UTC on June1, however, increased northerly wind shear caused Barbara to weaken back to a tropical depression. After re-intensifying into a tropical storm for a second time six hours later, Barbara attained its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1000mb (hPa; 29.53inHg) at 1800UTC. Drifting northeast, the storm maintained this intensity until landfall just northwest of the Mexico-Guatemala border at 1300UTC on June2. Rapid weakening ensued thereafter, with the system weakening to a tropical depression at 1800UTC. The low-level circulation dissipated six hours later, marking the dissipation <b>of</b> <b>Barbara.</b>|$|E

5|$|Alfred also {{assisted}} {{his own son}} {{by promoting}} men who could be relied on to support him, and by giving him opportunities for command in battle once he was old enough. In the view <b>of</b> <b>Barbara</b> Yorke, the compilation of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which magnified Alfred's achievements, may have been partly intended to strengthen {{the case for the}} succession of his own descendants. However, Yorke also argues that Æthelwold's position was not fatally undermined by Alfred's will. His mother had witnessed a charter as regina, whereas Alfred followed West Saxon tradition in refusing to have his wife consecrated as queen, and Æthelwold's status as the son of a queen may have given him an advantage over Edward. Æthelwold was still the senior ætheling, and the only surviving charter he witnessed shows both him and Edward as filius regis (son of a king), but lists Æthelwold above Edward, implying that he ranked above him.|$|E
5|$|Barbara {{strengthened}} into {{a hurricane}} around 1800UTC on May29 while located about 65mi (105km) east-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. At its peak intensity {{as it was}} making landfall, it had maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a barometric pressure estimated at 983mbar (hPa; 29.03inHg). With this intensity, Barbara made landfall {{on the coast of}} Tonalá, Chiapas at approximately 1950UTC. This marked both the easternmost and second earliest landfalling hurricane in the basin since reliable records began in 1966. As Barbara moved inland within the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, rapid dissipation occurred. The cloud tops warmed and Barbara degenerated into a tropical storm at 0000UTC on May30. This was followed by a downgrade to tropical depression nine hours later as Barbara's low-level circulation was disrupted by the mountainous terrain. Very early on May 31, the surface circulation <b>of</b> <b>Barbara</b> soon dissipated about 25mi (40km) north-northwest of Coatzacoalcos, Mexico, prior to emerging into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm's associated leftover moisture partially contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Andrea in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|By 1967, Ballard {{would not}} show up for {{recording}} dates, or would arrive at shows too inebriated to perform. For some early 1967 shows, she was replaced by Marlene Barrow. Looking for a more permanent replacement, Gordy once again thought <b>of</b> <b>Barbara</b> Randolph, possibly believing that Randolph could be groomed as lead singer for the group once {{it was decided to}} take Ross solo. However, Ross did not receive Randolph well. In April 1967, Gordy then contacted Cindy Birdsong, a member of Patti LaBelle & the Blue Belles who superficially resembled Ballard, with plans to bring her in as Ballard's replacement. He made his plans clear to Ballard and her group mates at a mid-April meeting, and Birdsong was brought in to begin rehearsals. Gordy did not fire Ballard outright at that time, asking Ballard instead to quit on her own.|$|E

5|$|In the 2015 {{video game}} , {{which is the}} sequel to Batman: Arkham City, while under the {{influence}} of Scarecrow's latest toxin, Batman hallucinates the Joker's shooting <b>of</b> <b>Barbara</b> Gordon after she is kidnapped by the mysterious Arkham Knight, a hallucination of Joker noting that he merely got lucky when he shot Barbara as he was ignorant of her true ties to Batman, and also claimed that he had actually been aiming for Barbara's head. In addition, the DLC side story Batgirl: A Matter of Family had various similarities to the story of The Killing Joke, including Joker kidnapping and holding Police Commissioner Gordon hostage at a run-down amusement park as well as the backstory revealing that Joker had conned and murdered the original person who owned the park into granting him control.|$|E

During her final years, McClintock led a more public life, especially after Evelyn Fox Keller's 1983 biography of her, A Feeling for the Organism, brought McClintock's story to the public. She remained a regular presence in the Cold Spring Harbor community, and gave talks on mobile genetic elements and the history of genetics research for the benefit of junior scientists.

5|$|U-30s third patrol {{was much}} more successful. Having left Wilhelmshaven on 23 December 1939, she journeyed into the North Sea.

That same day, she hit a much bigger target, the British battleship HMS Barham. Following the sinking <b>of</b> <b>Barbara</b> Robertson, U-30 fired a torpedo at the battleship and damaged her, killing four crew members. U-30s next three victims were sunk by mines laid by the U-boat: El Oso, sunk on 11 January; Gracia, damaged on 16 January and Cairnross, sunk on 17 January.
