5|$|Important {{theoretical}} work on {{the physical}} structure <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> occurred during {{the first decades of}} the twentieth century. In 1913, the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram was developed, propelling the astrophysical study <b>of</b> <b>stars.</b> Successful models were developed to explain the interiors <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> and stellar evolution. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin first proposed that stars were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her 1925 PhD thesis. The spectra <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> were further understood through advances in quantum physics. This allowed the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere to be determined.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of a tidal shock, streams <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> can be pulled away from the cluster halo, leaving only the core part of the cluster. These tidal {{interaction}} effects create tails <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> that can extend up to several degrees of arc away from the cluster. These tails typically both precede and follow the cluster along its orbit. The tails can accumulate significant portions of the original mass of the cluster, and can form clumplike features.|$|E

5|$|At Princeton University, Henry Norris Russell was {{following}} a similar course of research. He was studying {{the relationship between}} the spectral classification <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> and their actual brightness as corrected for distance—their absolute magnitude. For this purpose he used a set <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> that had reliable parallaxes and many of which had been categorized at Harvard. When he plotted the spectral types of these stars against their absolute magnitude, he found that dwarf stars followed a distinct relationship. This allowed the real brightness of a dwarf star to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} surface {{photometry}} <b>of</b> <b>star</b> clusters {{in the nearby}} dwarf elliptical galaxies NGC 185 and NGC 205, obtained from deep HST WFPC 2 F 555 W (V) and F 814 W (I) images. We have obtained surface brightness and color profiles <b>of</b> six <b>star</b> clusters in NGC 185, seven star clusters in NGC 205, and one recently discovered non-stellar object in NGC 205. The surface brightness profiles <b>of</b> ten <b>star</b> clusters are fitted well by the King model, and those <b>of</b> four <b>star</b> clusters are fitted well by the power-law. Three out <b>of</b> ten <b>star</b> clusters fitted well with King model show signs of tidal tails. It is essential to understand the structures <b>of</b> <b>star</b> clusters in studying the dynamical evolutions <b>of</b> <b>star</b> clusters. There have been several studies on the structures <b>of</b> <b>star</b> clusters in nearby galaxies (LMC, SMC, Fornax dwarf spheroidal, WLM, M 31, and NGC 5128). However, there is to date no study of the structures <b>of</b> <b>star</b> clusters in dwarf elliptical galaxies.

5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy. The new-found clusters contain hundreds of thousands <b>of</b> <b>stars,</b> a similar number <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> {{that can be found}} in globular clusters. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger—several hundred light-years across—and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters.|$|E

5|$|In the Local Supercluster it is {{possible}} to see star clusters, and current telescopes could in principle observe faint individual stars in the Local Group (see Cepheids). However, outside the Local Supercluster of galaxies, neither individual stars nor clusters <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> have been observed. The only exception is a faint image of a large star cluster containing hundreds of thousands <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> located at a distance of one billion light years—ten times further than the most distant star cluster previously observed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, {{information}} about the types and distances <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> became more readily available. The spectra <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> were shown to have distinctive features, which allowed them to be categorized. Annie Jump Cannon and Edward C. Pickering at Harvard College Observatory developed a method of categorization that became known as the Harvard Classification Scheme, published in the Harvard Annals in 1901.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of a disk <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> in an eccentric orbit around the central black hole.

The A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.|$|E

When studies were first made of the stars' proper motions, it was found that they are all moving in the same direction across the sky, at the same rate, further demonstrating that they were related.|$|E

5|$|The {{globular}} cluster Palomar 5, for example, {{is near the}} apogalactic point of its orbit after passing through the Milky Way. Streams <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> extend outward toward {{the front and rear}} of the orbital path of this cluster, stretching out to distances of 13,000 light-years. Tidal interactions have stripped away much of the mass from Palomar 5, and further interactions as it passes through the galactic core are expected to transform it into a long stream <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> orbiting the Milky Way halo.|$|E
5|$|The study <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> and stellar {{evolution}} {{is fundamental to}} our understanding of the Universe. The astrophysics <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior. Star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a protostar. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{fate of a}} {{globular cluster}} must be either to accrete stars at its core, causing its steady contraction, or gradual shedding <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> from its outer layers.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} how the properties <b>of</b> escaping <b>stars</b> {{are related to}} the initial conditions of their birth clusters. We find that the number <b>of</b> escaping <b>stars,</b> their spatial distribution, and their kinematics show a dependence on the initial conditions of the host cluster (substructure and virial ratio). Thus the properties <b>of</b> escaping <b>stars</b> can be used to inform us of the initial conditions <b>of</b> <b>star</b> formation, and also provide a window into the dynamical history <b>of</b> <b>star</b> clusters. The ESA Gaia mission will make observations of the positions and proper motions <b>of</b> these escaping <b>stars</b> at the required accuracy to allow us to investigate the dynamical evolution <b>of</b> local <b>star</b> clusters and provide an important insight into the initial conditions <b>of</b> <b>star</b> formation.
