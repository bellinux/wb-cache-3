40|$|Using a {{combination}} of different oligonucleotides and restriction enzymes we have examined the gross organisation <b>of</b> <b>repeats</b> within the most distal region of human chromosomes. We demonstrate here that human telomeres do not contain a pure uniform 6 base pair repeat unit but that {{there are at least}} three types <b>of</b> <b>repeat.</b> These three types <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> are present at the ends of most or all human chromosomes. The distribution of each type <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> appears to be non-random. Each human telomere has a similar arrangement <b>of</b> these <b>repeats</b> relative to the ends of the chromosome. This could reflect differences in the functions that they perform, or might result from the mutation and correction processes occurring at human telomeres. The number <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> units, the repeat types and arrangement differ at mouse telomeres. Analysing the change in length <b>of</b> the telomeric <b>repeat</b> region between an individuals blood and germline DNA reveals that this is due to variable amounts <b>of</b> the TTAGGG <b>repeat</b> and not the other repeat types. This organisation <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> units at human telomeres will only be confirmed upon the isolation and sequencing of full length (10 - 15 kn), intact human telomeres...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{need for}} {{patients}} on long-term medication to be periodically reviewed is well documented, but until now {{there have been}} no large-scale systematic studies of the process <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> prescribing. AIM: To propose a model for the process and control <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> prescribing in general practice, and to use this model to evaluate the management control and clinical control <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> prescribing in 50 practices. METHOD: Interviews were conducted with practice staff and the process <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> prescribing was observed in consenting practices from 57 randomly selected practices in Leeds. A batch <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> prescriptions was identified in each practice, and the patients' records were examined for evidence of clinical authorization and review. The records of 427 patients taking 556 drugs within three drug groups were studied. A subjective scoring system was used to assess quality of management control. Clinical control was assessed by noting {{the presence or absence of}} evidence in general practitioner records of doctor authorization <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> status, and <b>of</b> clinical review of therapy for each drug. RESULTS: Management control-Many practices had inadequate controls <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> prescribing, leading to unauthorized repeat prescriptions, poor compliance checks (or none at all), and inadequate systems, if any, for identifying patients in need of medication review, and for bringing them to prescribers' attention. Clinical control- 66 % <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> drugs showed no evidence of authorization by a doctor; 72 % showed no evidence of having been reviewed by a doctor in the previous 15 months. CONCLUSION: Inadequate control <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> prescribing is wasteful and potentially dangerous. Major improvement is required in the management and clinical aspects of the control <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> prescribing in many practices. This will need changes in procedures and training, and may require more resources and the imaginative use of nurses and pharmacists...|$|R
5|$|Behind Royal Sovereign was Marlborough, {{inextricably}} {{tangled with}} Impétueux. Badly damaged {{and on the}} verge of surrender, Impétueux was briefly reprieved when Mucius appeared through the smoke and collided with both ships. The three entangled ships continued exchanging fire for some time, all suffering heavy casualties with Marlborough and Impétueux losing all three of their masts. This combat continued for several hours. Captain Berkeley of Marlborough had to retire below with serious wounds, and command fell to Lieutenant John Monkton, who signalled for help from the frigates in reserve. Robert Stopford responded in HMS Aquilon, which had the assignment <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> signals, and towed Marlborough out of the line as Mucius freed herself and made for the regrouped French fleet to the north.

5|$|As Cimaron emerged {{over the}} South China Sea, {{officials}} in Vietnam began preparing for possible {{effects from the}} storm. Authorities began evacuating residents in flood-prone areas along the coast from Quảng Bình Khánh Hòa, including 12,500 in Thừa Thiên–Huế Province. Fishermen were urged to seek shelter at nearby ports until the storm subsided. The Vietnamese Government also requested the deployment of the nation's Army, Coast Guard, and Navy to assist in evacuation efforts. Residents still recovering from Typhoon Xangsane in early October were forced to secure their homes and evacuate once again. An estimated 218,000people were planned to be relocated across Vietnam: 68,000 in Quảng Nam, 60,000 in Quảng Trị, 50,000 in Thừa Thiên–Huế, and 40,000 in Quảng Bình. Appeals were made to roughly 3,500vessels, with a collective crew count of 32,285, to return to port. The Navy deployed 42ships for possible search and rescue missions. Following Cimaron's change in course and cessation of movement, the Vietnamese Government suspended all evacuation plans on November2; however, fishermen were urged to remain at port in fears <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> the incidents during Typhoon Chanchu in May of that year where over 200fishermen lost their lives.|$|E
500|$|Trinucleotide CAG repeats over 28 are {{unstable}} during replication, {{and this}} instability increases {{with the number}} <b>of</b> <b>repeats</b> present. This usually leads to new expansions as generations pass (dynamic mutations) instead of reproducing an exact copy <b>of</b> the trinucleotide <b>repeat.</b> This causes the number <b>of</b> <b>repeats</b> to change in successive generations, such that an unaffected parent with an [...] "intermediate" [...] number <b>of</b> <b>repeats</b> (28–35), or [...] "reduced penetrance" [...] (36–40), may pass on {{a copy of the}} gene with {{an increase in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>repeats</b> that produces fully penetrant HD. Such increases in the number <b>of</b> <b>repeats</b> (and hence earlier age of onset and severity of disease) in successive generations is known as genetic anticipation. Instability is greater in spermatogenesis than oogenesis; maternally inherited alleles are usually <b>of</b> a similar <b>repeat</b> length, whereas paternally inherited ones have a higher chance of increasing in length.

Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her.

5|$|Bagramyan's 11th Guards Army (the renamed 16th Army) was tasked to {{take part}} in the {{offensive}} and was given an additional three infantry divisions and two tank corps, a force composed of fifteen divisions. Bagramyan, however, argued to STAVKA that its planning was too audacious in the hopes <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> a successful encirclement like that in Uranus. He claimed that his forces would be overstretched and would have difficulty in attacking the entrenched German positions in Bolkhov. To avoid a repetition of the failure in Kharkov the previous year, he instead asked that the 61st Army from the Bryansk Front aid his 11th Guards in destroying the German forces in Bolkhov, thus eliminating the Ninth Army's protection from the north. He appealed to his front commander Vasily Sokolovsky as well the Bryansk's M. A. Reyter, both of whom rejected his proposal. In April, STAVKA recalled the main commanders of the Fronts and Armies to Moscow on a briefing of the preparations for the battle. Against the protestations of Sokolovsky and Reyter, Bagramyan proposed his alternative plan to Stalin, who agreed that it would be the more correct course to follow. Bagramyan was given twenty days to prepare the 11th Guards Army and on 24 May reported that his forces were ready. The 11th Guards now was composed of 135,000 men, 280 armored fighting vehicles, 2,700 artillery pieces and several hundred planes to lend air support for the ground forces. Stalin, however, felt it necessary to further wear thin the fighting abilities of the German forces and delayed the offensive.|$|E
