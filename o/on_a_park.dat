5|$|Benn met Caroline Middleton DeCamp (born 13 October 1926, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States) over tea at Worcester College, Oxford, in 1949 {{and just}} nine days after meeting her; he {{proposed}} to her <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> bench in the city. Later, he bought the bench from Oxford City Council and installed it {{in the garden of}} their home in Holland Park. Tony and Caroline had four children – Stephen, Hilary, Melissa, a feminist writer, and Joshua – and ten grandchildren. Caroline Benn died of cancer on 22 November 2000, aged 74, after a career as an educationalist.|$|E
5|$|Greek Revival residences {{were first}} built in Troy along Second Street {{in the late}} 1820s. In 1839, six local {{businessmen}} bought a parcel of land between Second and Third {{at the south end}} of what was then the developed area of the city and created Washington Park. Modeled on contemporary British residential squares such as those found in London's Bloomsbury neighborhoods, its first phase, on Washington Place, featured rows of townhouses with a unified facade fronting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> reserved exclusively for residents, whose deeds require a monthly maintenance fee. It retains its integrity despite some later alterations and damage, and is one of only two privately owned urban parks in New York.|$|E
5|$|More of {{his later}} works are the Jewish {{community}} center in Duisburg (1996–1999), and with Rafi Segal, the Palmach Museum in Tel Aviv (1995–2000). The Duisburg Jewish community center is located <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park,</b> the Garten der Erinnerung designed by Dani Karavan. The community center shares a similar concept to the Page Memorial in its likening {{to the open}} pages of a book, and symbolically the Torah of Moses. The Palmach Museum has an angular zig-zag plan positioned around the preservation of trees on the site. It is clad in a local sandstone that was found in excavations for the project. It was exhibited at the Venice Biennale.|$|E

25|$|The squad {{moves to}} London {{to track down}} Ali Hassan Salameh, who orchestrated the Munich Massacre, but the {{assassination}} attempt is interrupted by several drunken Americans. It is implied that these are agents of the CIA, which, according to Louis, protects and funds Salameh {{in exchange for his}} promise not to attack U.S. diplomats. Meanwhile, attempts are made on the assassins themselves. Carl is killed by an independent Dutch contract killer. In revenge, the team tracks her down and executes her at a houseboat in Hoorn, Netherlands. Hans is found stabbed to death <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> bench, while Robert is killed by an explosion in his workshop. Avner and Steve finally locate Salameh in Spain, but again their assassination attempt is thwarted, this time by Salameh's armed guards. It is implied that Louis has sold information on the team to the PLO.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} railway works, the 'Dalry Road Depot' also existed {{to the east}} of Dalry, {{including}} a goods yard and several engine sheds. These were demolished in the 1960s (with the main engine shed being demolished in October 1965). The site is part of the West Approach Road and a park. The railway works served the former Wester Dalry Branchline, which {{was a part of the}} Caledonian Railway to Leith via the now defunct Edinburgh Princes Street railway station. The railway had two stops in Dalry; 'Dalry Road' and 'Dalry Junction'. The Dalry Road Stop was a passenger station, built to meet demand following the tenement building boom in Dalry, and it opened in 1894. The station closed on 30 April 1962. The line is now closed and removed; a small section of the platform is visible <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> path near Orwell Terrace. The section of the line between Haymarket West Junction and the Dalry Junction station is now a roadway, the West Approach Road which takes traffic directly into the city centre.|$|E

The statue, popular with tourists, was erected by the Bond Street Association to commemorate 50 years {{since the end of}} World War II, and was unveiled in May 1995 by Princess Margaret. In 2013, maquettes of the sculpture (which are replicas, as Holofcener did not make any as part of the original artwork or design) were sold at Bonhams.|$|E
500|$|From 1956 to 1958, Ochs was {{a student}} at the Staunton Military Academy in rural Virginia, and when he {{graduated}} he returned to Columbus and enrolled in the Ohio State University. Unhappy after his first quarter, he took a leave of absence and went to Florida. While in Miami, the 18-year-old Ochs was jailed for two weeks for sleeping <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> bench, an incident he would later recall: [...] "Somewhere during the course of those fifteen days I decided to become a writer.

500|$|... "Baby Don't Cry" [...] {{was used}} as the theme song for the Japanese {{television}} drama series, Himitsu no Hanazono (2007). Alongside this, it was included in three Japanese commercials: the Avex Trax [...] "Myu-Umo" [...] music commercial, the Pokemero Joysound commercial, and for the Fuji TV television series, Secret Garden. An accompanying music video was shot in Japan by Masashi Muto. It opens with Amuro running on outdoor steps, and walking along a pavement bridge. As the chorus starts, intercut scenes of trees are shown, as she walks through the city. The second verse has her walking through a park, with yellow-ish leaves on the ground. She witnessed two small children <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> bench, holding the chain to a dog. The third chorus then has her walking through a city square, and ends with her standing on a beach front at sunset. A short version of the video was uploaded on Amuro's YouTube page on November 16, 2011, whilst a full version was uploaded one month later.|$|E
500|$|The show's writers {{spent time}} researching local California {{politics}} and attending Los Angeles City Council meetings. Schur said they observed that many community hearings were attended only by those opposed, often angrily, to the proposals under consideration. This confirmed his existing impression: [...] "I've been to some community meetings in my life, {{and it is}} often this feeling of utter sparseness. That nobody cares." [...] The depiction of public hearings in several Parks and Recreation episodes was inspired by this perspective, which was also {{the basis for the}} entire [...] "Canvassing" [...] episode. Schur asked urban planners in Claremont, California, whether efforts to turn a construction pit into a park could realistically take several months or longer. They told him that was entirely plausible, and that they had recently broken ground <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> that had been in various planning stages for 18 years. Schur said the pit project was conceived as a device to bring all the characters together, which was partially inspired by the way various characters in The Wire were brought together to work toward a common goal or project. The writers originally envisioned the pit becoming a park only in the series finale, although those plans were later changed and the pit was filled in during the second season.|$|E
500|$|Bookends {{contains}} many of Paul Simon's major themes, including [...] "youth, alienation, life, love, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality". Simon's work on Bookends is loosely autobiographical, designed {{to function as}} both a personal and artistic statement. Simon, [...] "feeling especially auteurist in the Dylan style of the day", had planned out the album's concept before he began writing, telling Garfunkel [...] "I'm going to start writing a whole side of an album—a cycle of songs. I want the early ones to be about youth and the last song to be about old age, and I want the feel of each song to fit." [...] Bookends, originally released primarily as a vinyl LP, opens and closes side one of the disc with the [...] "Bookends Theme", a brief acoustic piece (once compared to English rock band the Moody Blues) that evokes [...] "a time of innocence". [...] "Save the Life of My Child" [...] is a dramatic story involving drugs, violence and a mother and child relationship. According to James Bennighof, the song [...] "deals with individual crises in crowded urban settings, along with references to larger societal forces {{and at least a}} hint of some transcendent perspective". The song crossfades into [...] "America", which follows two young lovers—"an apparently impromptu romantic traveling alliance"—as they board a Greyhound bus [...] "to look for America". It is a protest song that [...] "creates a cinematic vista that tells of the singer's search for a literal and physical America that seems to have disappeared, along with the country's beauty and ideals". [...] "Overs" [...] includes themes regarding the disintegration of love and marriage. [...] "Old Friends" [...] paints a portrait of two old men reminiscing on the years of their youth. The two men [...] "sit <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> bench like bookends", and ponder how strange it feels to be nearing their lifetime. The song is joined with the [...] "Bookends Theme", this time with vocal accompaniment from the duo. The piece closes the entire suite with the [...] "resigned admonition" [...] to [...] "Preserve your memories / They're all that's left you".|$|E

2500|$|In 2005 {{a bronze}} statue of Albany's 73rd mayor Thomas Whalen III (served 1983-93) and his golden {{retriever}} named Finn McCool {{was installed in}} the park. The statue is seated <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> bench {{with his right hand}} on top of the dog's head. Mayor Whalen is the only mayor of Albany to have a statue erected in his honor in the city. A statue for Mayor Corning was proposed and commissioned though it was never cast, a clay model of which sat in Mayor Whalen's office for many years. The statues of Mayor Whalen and his dog are life-size, and including the bench the monument is [...] long and [...] wide, it was designed by Hy Rosen.|$|E

To the north and northwest of Stamp and Hornbake Plaza are the North Campus communities, Maryland Stadium, the Eppley Recreation Center (the main gym on campus), the XFINITY Center, and the Wooded Hillock, a [...] forest located next to the XFINITY Center; Stadium Drive runs between the more southern Maryland Stadium and the rest of these.

2500|$|This song {{had been}} {{announced}} {{as the third}} single from The Red Album. Spike Jonze {{was said to be}} directing a video for the song. In the end, the video was not filmed and instead skiing and snowboarding film director Warren Miller used the song in a film called Children of Winter. The Weezer blog stated that it should not be considered official: [...] "Note that while this [...] 'THE' music video for 'Greatest Man' - it's 'a' music video - [...] nonetheless very cool indeed!" [...] However, Weezer did film a video for the song through MTV, when they were selected as the MTV Artist of the Week. The video has the band sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> bench lip syncing to their song playing through a boom box.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to painting portraits and full-length figurative works, [...] Chase began painting landscapes in earnest {{in the late}} 1880s. His interest in landscape art may have been spawned by the landmark New York exhibit of French impressionist works from Parisian dealer Durand-Ruel in 1886. Chase is best remembered for two series of landscape subjects, both painted in an impressionist manner. The first was his scenes of Prospect and Central Parks in New York; the second were his summer landscapes at Shinnecock. Chase usually featured people prominently in his landscapes. Often he depicted woman and children in leisurely poses, relaxing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> bench, on the beach, or lying in the summer grass at Shinnecock. The Shinnecock works in particular {{have come to be}} thought of by art historians as particularly fine examples of American Impressionism.|$|E
2500|$|Gould was {{averse to}} cold and wore heavy {{clothing}} (including gloves), even in warm places. He was once arrested, presumably {{mistaken for a}} vagrant, while sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> bench in Sarasota, Florida, dressed in his standard all-climate attire of coat(s), hat and mittens. He also disliked social functions. He hated being touched, and in later life he limited personal contact, relying on the telephone and letters for communication. On one visit to Steinway Hall in New York City in 1959, the chief piano technician at the time, William Hupfer, greeted Gould by giving him {{a slap on the}} back. Gould was shocked by this, and complained of aching, lack of coordination, and fatigue because of the incident. He went on to explore the possibility of litigation against Steinway & Sons if his apparent injuries were permanent. He was known for cancelling performances at the last minute, which is why Bernstein's above-mentioned public disclaimer opens with, [...] "Don't be frightened, Mr. Gould is here... will appear in a moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|The writers {{spent time}} researching local California {{politics}} and attending Los Angeles City Council meetings. Schur said they observed that many community hearings were attended only by those opposed, often angrily, to the proposals under consideration. This fact {{became a major}} component of town hall scenes, and was the basis for the [...] "Canvassing" [...] episode. The writers consulted with real-life government officials such as urban planners and elected officials. Scott Albright, a California city planner, provided direct feedback for the Mark Brendanawicz character, and the inspiration for Ron Swanson's anti-government convictions came from a real-life encounter Schur had in Burbank with a Libertarian government official who admitted, [...] "I don't really believe in the mission of my job." [...] The concept of turning a construction pit into a park was seen as a device to bring all the characters together working toward a common goal. The writers originally envisioned the pit becoming a park only in the series finale, although those plans were later changed and the pit was filled in during the second season.
