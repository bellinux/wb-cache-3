5|$|Argyle {{lost three}} of their next nine matches to give {{themselves}} a chance of avoiding relegation, but their win at Doncaster Rovers {{proved to be the}} last game that they would collect any points in. Defeats at home to Middlesbrough and away to Watford left the club <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> return to England's third tier, and that was confirmed in their next game. Newcastle United won 2–0 at Home Park to secure the Championship title, and relegated the home side at the same time. The club finished 23rd in the league table after defeat by bottom club Peterborough United {{on the final day of}} the season, eight points adrift of safety. Jamie Mackie finished as the club's top scorer with eight goals in all competitions, and captain Carl Fletcher was voted Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Republican William S. Taylor {{defeated}} both Democratic {{candidates in}} the general election, but his margin over Goebel was only 2,383 votes. Democrats in the General Assembly began making accusations of voting irregularities in some counties, but in a surprise decision, the Board of Elections created by the Goebel Election Law and manned by three hand-picked Goebel Democrats, ruled 2–1 that the disputed ballots should count, saying the law gave them no legal power to reverse the official county results and that under the Kentucky Constitution the power to review the election lay in the General Assembly. The Assembly then invalidated enough Republican ballots to give the election to Goebel. The Assembly's Republican minority was incensed, as were voters in traditionally Republican districts. For several days, the state hovered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible civil war.|$|E

25|$|His {{activities}} came to {{an abrupt}} end when the 1880 United Kingdom general election was announced for April and he returned to fight it. The Conservatives were defeated by the Liberal Party; William Gladstone was again Prime Minister. Sixty-three Home Rulers were elected, including twenty-seven Parnell supporters, Parnell being returned for three seats: Cork City, Mayo and Meath. He chose to sit for the Cork seat. His triumph facilitated his nomination in May in place of Shaw as leader of a new Home Rule League Party, faced with a country <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> land war.|$|E
25|$|Third {{and most}} {{important}} match in the group came against England. England batted first and scored 171/4 with Jos Buttler's magnificent fifty. Sri Lanka in the chase, again looked so poor, where 50 runs for 5 wickets after 9 overs. The defending champions were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> huge defeat in the match, Angelo Mathews came to the crease. He with Kapugedera smashed England spinner in all corners where the match {{went down to the}} wire at the end. With falling wickets in regular intervals, Sri Lanka lost the match by 10 runs at the end, where skipper Mathews played a gem of an innings with a hamstring injury. But his 54 ball 73 was not enough at the end and Sri Lanka along with South Africa were eliminated from the World Twenty20.|$|E

25|$|The {{showcasing}} and unorthodoxy of Dilshan {{was best}} highlighted against India on 15 December 2009, where Sri Lanka chased a mammoth target of 414 posted by India. The pitch at Rajkot looked {{so nice to}} bat on, Dilshan started the run chase with Tharanga, instead of Jayasuriya. The blistering knock reached fifty from 38 balls and then hundred from 73 balls. His first 150 came from 115 balls and Sri Lanka <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sensational win. The knock of 160 was full of hooks, pulls and many scoops of his variety, leading the way to victory. But after Dilshan falls bowled by Harbhajan Singh, the match opened for Indians. They took all the advantages and Sri Lanka bowled out for 411 runs, in an eye margin for the victory. This was Dilshan's third century in ODIs, where the match was described by commentators {{as one of the}} best chases in World Cricket.|$|E
25|$|Amtrak {{commenced}} {{operations in}} 1971 with $40million in direct federal aid, $100million in federally insured loans, and a somewhat larger private contribution. Officials expected that Amtrak would break even by 1974, but those expectations proved unrealistic and annual direct federal aid reached a 17-year high in 1981 of $1.25billion. During the Reagan administration, appropriations were halved and by 1986, federal support fell to a decade low of $601million, {{almost none of}} which were capital appropriations. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Congress continued the reductionist trend even while Amtrak expenses held steady or rose. Amtrak was forced to borrow to meet short-term operating needs, and by 1995 Amtrak was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cash crisis {{and was unable to}} continue to service its debts. In response, in 1997 Congress authorized $5.2billion for Amtrak {{over the next five years}} – largely to complete the Acela capital project – on the condition that Amtrak submit to the ultimatum of self-sufficiency by 2003 or liquidation. While Amtrak made financial improvements during this period, it did not achieve self-sufficiency.|$|E
25|$|Upon his re-election, Wallace {{indicated}} {{his intention}} to undertake a three-month review the club's business operations and it was revealed this included cuts to the first-team wage budget. The Rangers manager signed off on a wage reduction on 11 January, {{the same day as}} the club hired Philip Nash as a financial consultant to assist with the business review. Following this the club unsuccessfully asked the first-team squad to take pay cuts of around 15% until summer 2015 and as greater scrutiny was focused on the club's finances, Rangers financial director Brian Stockbridge resigned on 24 January. Indeed, in early February Wallace was forced to deny claims that the club was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second insolvency event, however, two-weeks later Rangers borrowed £1.5m from shareholders Sandy Easdale and Laxey Partners for working capital. The loan agreement was widely criticised, as Laxey Partners stood to make £150,000 in either interest or shares {{by the time it was}} repaid and also the Albion Car Park and Edmiston House were being used as security. Despite this, prior to his court case, former director Imran Ahmad has failed to ring-fence cash at the club ahead of his now £500,000 lawsuit.|$|E

25|$|His Test career {{highlights}} include 329 against New Zealand in Lahore in the 2001–02 season, {{which is the}} second highest Test score by a Pakistani and the twelfth highest overall. He also scored a century (184 runs) in his 100th Test, becoming only the fifth player to do so (after Colin Cowdrey, Alec Stewart, Gordon Greenidge and Javed Miandad; Ricky Ponting subsequently emulated the feat). Inzamam made a century in each innings of the second Test match against England in 2005, to become Pakistan's leading centurion with 24 centuries, breaking Javed Miandad's record. His 25th century in the 2nd Test against India on 22 January 2006 made him the 10th player to score 25 or more centuries. He also managed 138 not out when the team was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> humiliating defeat against Bangladesh, eventually saving the Test match and leading his team to victory. His 92 not out against South Africa in late 2006 again showed his ability to bat in a crisis in a match winning manner. He scored twin half centuries when all appeared lost to draw the first test in Mohali against India in 2005, and also scored 184 runs in his 100th test match in the same away series causing the series to be drawn. He still holds the record for most consecutive half centuries against a country with nine in nine innings against England. This streak started from 31 May 2001 and lasted till 13 July 2006. He scored {{a century and a}} half century at Lords in 1996. His 118 against Australia in Hobart almost won the test for Pakistan but Adam Gilchrist's match winning 149 not out made the difference. His average in matches won is second only to Donald Bradman and Kumar Sangakkara.|$|E
500|$|In 1888 Henson {{was ordained}} priest.

At twenty-five he was the youngest vicar in the country, and had a large staff of curates to manage. An All Souls colleague Cosmo Lang, himself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Church career, visited Henson at Barking and noted, [...] "He came six months ago to a parish dead– 250 a good congregation in the church; and now, when he preaches, every seat is filled– 1100!" ...|$|E
500|$|Jim Morrison, a self-professed [...] "acid-evangelist of rock", {{had been}} {{fascinated with the}} public media outlets and {{frequently}} coined buzzwords and phrases to generate attention for the Doors. The band's rise to stardom and publications drawing Morrison as a sex symbol, however, drastically modified his outlook on pop culture. Throughout 1968, Morrison's behavior became increasingly erratic: he began drinking heavily and distanced himself from studio work to focus on his more immediate passions, poetry and film making. At the time, Morrison was also struggling with anxiety, and {{felt like he was}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nervous breakdown. He considered quitting the Doors, but was persuaded by Ray Manzarek to finish recording The Soft Parade before making such a decision.|$|E

Navarro never felt he fit properly in the band and the chemistry just wasn't there with him. Following attempts to write and rehearse for their seventh studio album, in April 1998, it was announced that Navarro had been fired from the band due to creative differences; Kiedis stated that the decision was [...] "mutual". With the band <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> break-up, Kiedis informed Flea that he felt the only way the band could continue is if Frusicante would return. Flea surprised Kiedis by stating he had been in contact with Frusciante and had a feeling he might be open to rejoining. That same month after Navarro's departure, Flea visited Frusciante and invited him to rejoin the band. An emotional and now sober Frusciante readily accepted the invitation. With Frusciante back, the band went on to release three of their most successful albums; 1999's Californication, 2002's By the Way and 2006's Stadium Arcadium.|$|E
500|$|In November, Benfica had a busy {{schedule}} with six matches, {{two for the}} UEFA Cup. They began with a visit to Estádio D. Afonso Henriques, home of Vitória de Guimarães. David Suazo's 14th-minute goal was Benfica's 5,000th goal in competition. Sidnei made the score 2–0, with Guimarães scoring a goal. The win gave Benfica second place, one point shy of leader Leixões. Sánchez Flores attributed the victory to his players' commitment. The following Thursday, Benfica hosted Galatasaray in match-day two of the UEFA Cup. They lost two-nil, with second-half goals from Emre Aşık and Ümit Karan. It was the club's first European loss to a Turkish team, and their largest home loss in European competition since 6 March 1997. With one point in two games, Benfica had to earn points in their next match {{to remain in the}} competition. On 10 November, the club romped over Desportivo das Aves in the Portuguese Cup. The Liga de Honra side was helpless against Benfica's offence, trailing three-nil at the 30-minute mark. Almost a week later, Benfica hosted a league game against Estrela da Amadora. After a first half in which they struggled to beat Estrela goalkeeper Nélson, in the 51th minute Nuno Gomes assisted Sidnei for the game's only goal. Sánchez Flores called the win important because it held Benfica's lead over their rivals. The club continued to win domestically, with an away victory over Académica on the 23rd. Earning 21 points in nine match days was a club high for the 2000s, matched only in 2000–01. Four days later, Benfica visited Karaiskakis Stadium to play Olympiacos. With a 39th-second goal from Luciano Galletti, the club trailed from the beginning. They conceded three more goals {{in the first half and}} a fifth in the second half, losing 5–1. The result left Benfica <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> UEFA Cup exit, and was a dark remembrance of their worst European defeat nine years before in Vigo. Their performance was criticised; according to Luís Avelãs it was [...] "extremely poor, full of beginner's mistakes, inadmissible distractions and multiple poor choices", and Sánchez Flores apologised to the fans.|$|E

2500|$|Clark Reservation State Park is a {{state park}} in Onondaga County, New York. [...] The park is in the Town of DeWitt, south of Syracuse. [...] It {{was the site of}} a large {{waterfall}} {{at the end of the}} last Ice Age; the plunge basin at the base of the old falls is now a small lake. James Macfarlane described the area in 1879, [...] "On approaching the lake from the turnpike on the south side, the tourist is startled at finding himself, without any notice, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> yawning gulf, precisely like that of the Niagara River below the Falls, and nearly as deep."

2500|$|At {{the age of}} eighteen, Siqueiros {{and several}} of his colleagues from the School of Fine Arts joined Venustiano Carranza's Constitutional Army {{fighting}} Huerta's government. When Huerta fell in 1914, Siqueiros became enmeshed in the [...] "post-revolutionary" [...] infighting, as the Constitutional Army had to battle the diverse political factions of Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata for control. His military travels around the country exposed him to Mexican culture and the raw everyday struggles of the working and rural poor classes. After Carranza's forces had gained control, Siqueiros briefly returned to Mexico City to paint before traveling to Europe in 1919. First in Paris, he absorbed the influence of cubism, intrigued particularly with Paul Cézanne and the use of large blocks of intense color. While there, he also met Diego Rivera, another Mexican painter of [...] "the big three" [...] just <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> legendary career in muralism, and traveled with him throughout Italy to study the great fresco painters of the Renaissance.|$|E
