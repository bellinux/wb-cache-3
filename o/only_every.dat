5|$|Because the kakapo is long-lived, with {{an average}} life {{expectancy}} of 58years and the maximum at about 90 years, it tends to have an adolescence before it starts breeding. Males start booming at about 5years of age. It was thought that females reached sexual maturity at 9 years of age, but this idea was debunked in the 2008 breeding season when two 6-year-old females named Apirama and Rakiura laid eggs. Generally females do not seek out males until they are between 9 and 11 years old. The kakapo does not breed every year and {{has one of the}} lowest rates of reproduction among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply. Rimu mast occurs <b>only</b> <b>every</b> three to five years, so in rimu-dominant forests such as those on Codfish Island, kakapo breeding occurs as infrequently.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Richards {{preferred}} to arrange his rotation so that Pierce started <b>only</b> <b>every</b> fifth or sixth day, holding him back against weaker teams but using him more often for big {{games against the}} powerful Yankees and Indians. Catcher Sherm Lollar later observed that although it was essentially a compliment to Pierce's ability, he might have picked up more victories and won 20 games sooner in his career had he faced each opponent more equally. With a 1–0 two-hitter at Washington on August 3, in which the White Sox won on an unearned run {{in the ninth inning}} with a hit batter, error and sacrifice fly, Pierce began a streak of 39⅔ consecutive scoreless innings – the longest such streak in the AL between 1926, when Ted Lyons had a 41-inning streak for the White Sox, and 1968; it remains the fifth longest ever by a left-hander, and the longest by an AL southpaw since 1905. The streak ended when he allowed two unearned runs against the Browns in the sixth inning on August 19; two additional earned runs in the tenth inning ended his streak, dating to July 29, of 49⅔ innings without an earned run, and gave him a 4–3 loss. He led the league in strikeouts (186) and was second in ERA (2.72), and on September 27 started for the White Sox in the final game in Browns history, winning 2–1 in 11 innings at St. Louis. His seven shutouts that season were the second most by an AL left-hander since 1916, matched only by Hal Newhouser's 1945 total of eight.|$|E

25|$|A {{four-stroke}} cylinder {{produces a}} power stroke <b>only</b> <b>every</b> other {{rotation of the}} crankshaft, with three strokes being pumping losses. This doubles the real surface-to-volume ratio for the four-stroke reciprocating piston engine and the displacement increased. The Wankel, therefore, has higher volumetric efficiency and lower pumping losses through the absence of choking valves. Because of the quasi-overlap of the power strokes, that cause the smoothness of the engine and the avoidance of the four-stroke cycle in a reciprocating engine, the Wankel engine is very quick to react to power increases, giving a quick delivery of power when the demand arises, especially at higher rpm's. This difference is more pronounced when compared to four-cylinder reciprocating engines and less pronounced when compared to higher cylinder counts.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{variations}} to this basic cycle occur. In North America, the females of some species store sperm in their oviducts {{for at least}} eight months, and the males (all species of which undergo spermatogenesis during the summer) store sperm in the vas deferens {{for at least a}} year. Thus, species that store sperm for a shorter duration mate in the spring and store sperm in the vas deferens, while those that do so for a longer duration mate in the fall and store sperm in the oviduct over the winter, after which fertilization occurs the following spring. In addition, species that occur further north, where it is colder during much of the year and the feeding and growing season is short, may reproduce <b>only</b> <b>every</b> other year or less. Those found in central and southern Mexico or the tropics have reproductive cycles that correspond mostly with the rainy season.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} factors {{contributing}} to {{the decline in the}} population of the sand tigers. Sand tigers reproduce at an unusually low rate, {{due to the fact that}} they do not have more than two pups at a time and because they breed <b>only</b> <b>every</b> second or third year. This shark is a highly prized food item in the western northern Pacific, off Ghana and off India and Pakistan where they are caught by fishing trawlers, although they are more commonly caught with a fishing line. Sand tigers' fins are a popular trade item in Japan. Off North America, it is fished for its hide and fins. Shark liver oil is a popular product in cosmetic products such as lipstick. It is sought by anglers in fishing competitions in South Africa and some other countries. In Australia it has been reduced in numbers by spear fishers using poison and where it is now protected. It is also prized as an aquarium exhibit in the United States, Europe, Australia and South Africa because of its docile and hardy nature. Thus, overfishing is a major contributor to the population decline. All indications show that the world population in sand tigers has been reduced significantly in size since 1980. Many sand tigers are caught in shark nets, and then either strangled or taken by fishermen. Estuaries along the United States of America's eastern Atlantic coast houses many of the young sand tiger sharks. These estuaries are susceptible to non-point source pollution that is harmful to the pups.|$|E
25|$|Moreover {{at a spot}} in the Park {{where there}} is a charming wood he has another Palace built of cane, of which I must give you a description. It is gilt all over, and most elaborately {{finished}} inside. It is stayed on gilt and lackered columns, on each of which is a dragon all gilt, the tail of which is attached to the column whilst the head supports the architrave, and the claws likewise are stretched out right and left to support the architrave. The roof, like the rest, is formed of canes, covered with a varnish so strong and excellent that no amount of rain will rot them. These canes are a good 3 palms in girth, and from 10 to 15 paces in length. They are cut across at each knot, and then the pieces are split so as to form from each two hollow tiles, and with these the house is roofed; <b>only</b> <b>every</b> such tile of cane has to be nailed down to prevent the wind from lifting it. In short, the whole Palace is built of these canes, which (I may mention) serve also for a great variety of other useful purposes. The construction of the Palace is so devised that it can be taken down and put up again with great celerity; and it can all be taken to pieces and removed whithersoever the Emperor may command. When erected, it is braced against mishaps from the wind by more than 200 cords of silk.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the true}} teeth of Mesozoic birds like Archaeopteryx or Aberratiodontus, the pseudoteeth of the Pelagornithidae {{do not seem}} to have had {{serrated}} or otherwise specialized cutting edges, and were useful to hold prey for swallowing whole rather than to tear bits off it. Since the teeth were hollow or at best full of cancellous bone and are easily worn or broken off in fossils, it is surmised they were not extremely resilient in life either. Pelagornithid prey would thus have been soft-bodied, and have encompassed mainly cephalopods and soft-skinned fishes. Prey items may have reached considerable size. Though some reconstructions show pelagornithids as diving birds in the manner of gannets, the thin-walled highly pneumatized bones which must have fractured easily judging from the state of fossil specimens make such a mode of feeding unlikely, if not outright dangerous. Rather, prey would have been picked up from immediately below the ocean surface while the birds were flying or swimming, and they probably submerged only the beak in most situations. Their quadrate bone articulation with the lower jaw resembled that of a pelican or other birds that can open their beak widely. Altogether, the pseudotooth birds would have filled an ecological niche almost identical to that of the larger fish-eating pterosaurs, whose extinction {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous may well have paved the way for the highly successful 50-million-year reign of the Pelagornithidae. Like modern albatrosses (but perhaps unlike pterosaurs in the different climate and plate tectonics of the Mesozoic), the pseudotooth birds could have used the system of ocean currents and atmospheric circulation to take round-track routes soaring over the open oceans, returning to breed <b>only</b> <b>every</b> few years. Unlike albatrosses today, which avoid the tropical equatorial currents with their doldrums, Pelagornithidae were found in all sorts of climate, and records from around 40 Ma stretch from Belgium through Togo to the Antarctic. It is conspicuous that penguins and plotopterids – both wing-propelled divers that foraged over the continental shelf – are almost invariably found in the company of pseudotooth birds. Thus, pseudotooth birds seem to have gathered in some numbers in upwelling regions, presumably to feed but perhaps to breed nearby also (see below).|$|E
