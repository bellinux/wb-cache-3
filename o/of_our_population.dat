2500|$|According to the Commonwealth Treasury, {{immigration}} {{can reduce}} {{the average age of}} the Australian population: [...] "The level of net overseas migration is important: net inflows of migrants to Australia reduce the rate of population ageing because migrants are younger on average than the resident population. Currently, around 85 per cent of migrants are aged under 40 when they migrate to Australia, compared to around 55 per cent for the resident population." [...] Ross Gittins, an economics columnist at Fairfax Media, has said that the Government's focus on skilled migration has in fact reduced the average age of migrants. [...] "More than half are aged 15 to 34, compared with 28 per cent <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>population.</b> Only 2 per cent of permanent immigrants are 65 or older, compared with 13 per cent of our population." [...] Because of these statistics, Gittens claims that immigration is slowing the ageing of the Australian population and that the [...] "net benefit to the economy is a lot more clear-cut." ...|$|E
2500|$|The largest {{hindrance}} {{to effectively}} organizing the militia was the scattered population of only 14,273; and of this number, {{the majority were}} scattered around the state on isolated farms. The only real town in Arkansas in 1820 was Arkansas Post, a tiny village {{of no more than}} forty houses. To make matters worse, there were few roads in Territorial Arkansas, thereby making communication with the militiamen very difficult. Adjutant General A. P. Spencer noted that some militia units were unable to drill since [...] "the extent of Territory they cover is [...] great to muster them at one point..." [...] As late as 1827, Governor George Izard was complaining of the difficulty of organizing the rural Arkansans into a cohesive militia force: [...] "The scattered state <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>Population</b> here and the constant changes of Residence among the Inhabitants make it impractical to organize the Militia in such a manner as may render their Service prompt and efficient".|$|E

But even supposing we were to offer reasonable wages for teachers; an average all-round wage of £1,000 a year or so, and respect and dignity; it does not follow that we should get as many as we should need--using the methods that are in use to-day--to provide this ideal schooling for most <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>population,</b> or, indeed, for any large section <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Needle {{decompression}} of {{a tension}} pneumothorax {{can be a}} lifesaving procedure. It requires an adequate needle length to reach the chest wall to rapidly remove air. With adult obesity exceeding {{one third of the}} United States population in 2010, we sought to evaluate the proper catheter length that may result in a successful needle decompression procedure. Advance Trauma Life Support (ATLS) currently recommends a 51 millimeter (mm) needle, while the needles stocked in our emergency department are 46 mm. Given the obesity rates <b>of</b> <b>our</b> patient <b>population,</b> we hypothesize these needles would not have a tolerable success rate of 90 %. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 91 patient records that had computed tomography of the chest and measured the chest wall depth at the second intercostal space bilaterally. Results: We found that 46 mm needles would only be successful in 52. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>our</b> patient <b>population,</b> yet the ATLS recommended length of 51 mm has a success rate of 64. 8 %. Therefore, using a 64 mm needle would be successful in 79 % percent <b>of</b> <b>our</b> patient <b>population.</b> Conclusion: Use of longer length needles for needle thoracostomy is essential given the extent of the nation’s adult obesity population.
