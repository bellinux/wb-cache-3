50|$|The {{fuel system}} is a very simple design. A {{mechanical}} or electric fuel lift pump feeds a Stanadyne Rotary Distributor <b>Injection</b> <b>pump</b> at low pressure. The distributor <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> controls both metering, via an internal centrifugal governor, and high pressure fuel delivery to the fuel injectors via internal precision hydraulic pumps. Near {{the top of the}} compression stroke fuel is atomized at high pressure into a hemispherical Inconel prechamber in the cylinder heads using Bosch pintle and seat mechanical fuel injectors. This is called Indirect injection. GM used fully mechanical DB2 series <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> on all military HMMWVs and 1982-1993 6.2's and 6.5's. From 1994 till end of production GM used the electronically controlled Stanadyne DS4 series of <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> in their light trucks. A mechanical DB4 series <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> can be found on some 6.5L marine engines.|$|R

40|$|<b>Injection</b> <b>pumps</b> {{constitute}} {{an essential component}} for many industrial applications. The main focus {{of this study is}} to predict the effect of the size of the pipeline on the cross flow injection process. A test-rig was designed, built and equipped with three different pipelines, 1 ½", ¾" and ½" diameters. Comparison was made under constant line pressure of 40 -bar and line flow rate of 5 liter/min, with a fixed <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> rotational speed of 100 rpm. The main parameter tested was the injection dose capacity at different pump displacements. Cross flow mixing process is also theoretically studied using 3 D-CFD analysis to show the injection cross flow behavior for the same geometry and parameters used for experimental test. Results show that increasing the size of the pipeline increases <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> doses ability. This effect is insignificant at lower <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> displacements, while the effect of the size of the pipeline becomes dominant when increasing the displacement. By changing the size of the pipeline from ½" to 1 ½" diameter <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> dose capacity increases by 3. 24 % at 100 % pump displacement. Selecting larger pipe sizes for injection ports is recommended whenever possible...|$|R

The PMD contains two power transistors that should be cooled by proper contact with the <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> body.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method to predict the <b>oil</b> <b>injection</b> time of fluid dynamic {{bearings}} (FDBs) with a tied shaft by applying Kirchhoff&# 39;s pressure law. Since the oil is injected by capillary phenomenon, the volume flow rate can be calculated by utilizing Kirchhoff&# 39;s pressure law. Then, we calculated the <b>oil</b> <b>injection</b> time of the FDBs with a tied shaft by dividing the volume flow rate by the clearance volumes of the journal bearing, the thrust bearing, and the recirculation channel (RC), respectively. We generated simulation models of the FDBs used in a 2. 5 aEuro(3) HDD spindle motor with a tied shaft. The total <b>oil</b> <b>injection</b> times of the FDBs with and without a RC were 0. 302 and 0. 335 s, respectively.
