25|$|Animism {{encompasses}} the beliefs that all material phenomena have agency, that there exists no {{hard and fast}} distinction between the spiritual and physical (or material) world and that soul or spirit or sentience exists not only in humans, but also in other animals, plants, rocks, geographic features such as mountains or rivers or <b>other</b> <b>entities</b> <b>of</b> the natural environment, including thunder, wind and shadows.
