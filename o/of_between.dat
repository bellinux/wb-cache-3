5|$|Although {{white dwarf}} {{material}} is initially plasma—a fluid composed of nuclei and electrons—it was theoretically predicted in the 1960s {{that at a}} late stage of cooling, it should crystallize, starting at its center. The crystal structure {{is thought to be}} a body-centered cubic lattice. In 1995 it was suggested that asteroseismological observations of pulsating white dwarfs yielded a potential test of the crystallization theory, and in 2004, observations were made that suggested approximately 90% of the mass of BPM 37093 had crystallized. Other work gives a crystallized mass fraction <b>of</b> <b>between</b> 32% and 82%. As a white dwarf core undergoes crystallization into a solid phase, latent heat is released which provides a source of thermal energy that delays its cooling.|$|E
5|$|Any {{tropical}} cyclone that develops within the North Indian Ocean between 100°E and 45°E is {{monitored by the}} India Meteorological Department (IMD, RSMC New Delhi). Within the region a {{tropical cyclone}} is defined as being a non frontal synoptic scale cyclone, that originates over tropical or subtropical waters with organized convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation. The lowest official classification used in the North Indian Ocean is a Depression, which has 3-minute sustained wind speeds <b>of</b> <b>between</b> 17–27kn (20–31mph; 31–49km/h). Should the depression intensify further then {{it will become a}} Deep Depression, which has winds between 28–33kn (32–38mph; 50–61km/h). The system will be classified as a cyclonic storm and assigned a name by the IMD, if it should develop gale-force wind speeds <b>of</b> <b>between</b> 34–47kn (39–54mph; 62–88km/h). Severe Cyclonic Storms have storm force wind speeds <b>of</b> <b>between</b> 48–63kn (55–72mph; 89–117km/h), while Very Severe Cyclonic Storms have hurricane-force winds of 64–89kt (73–102mph; 118–166km/h). Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storms have hurricane-force winds of 90–119kn (166–221km/h, 104–137mph). The highest classification used in the North Indian Ocean is a Super Cyclonic Storm, which have hurricane-force winds of above 120kn (138mph; 222km/h).|$|E
