60|$|When I {{travelled}} in South-West Africa, at {{one part}} of my journey a plague of bush-ticks attacked the roots of my oxen's tails. Their bites made festering sores, which ended {{in some of the}} tails dropping bodily off. I heard such accidents were not at all uncommon. The animals did not travel the worse for it. Now <b>ox-tail</b> soup is proverbially nutritious.|$|E
60|$|They {{sat down}} to dinner, and ate their <b>ox-tail</b> soup. It is terrible {{to think of the}} subtlety with which the Evil One can insinuate himself among the most pious; for soup at middle-day is one of his most {{dangerous}} wiles, and it is precisely with the simple-minded inhabitants of the country and of the suburbs that this vice is most prevalent.|$|E
6000|$|They {{escaped with}} a reprieve to Conrade, {{and the loss}} of one tooth of Francis's, and when the rewards had been laid out, and {{presents}} chosen for all the stay-at-home children, including Rose, Lady Temple became able to think about other matters. The whole party were in a little den at the pastrycook's; the boys consuming mutton pies, and the ladies <b>ox-tail</b> soup, while waiting to be taken up by the waggonette which had of late been added to the Myrtlewood establishment, when the little lady thus spoke-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you know," [...] {{observed}} Gildart in a {{burst of}} reckless humour, [...] "we could not get on very well, Miss Stuart, without some sorts of details. <b>Ox-tails,</b> for instance, are absolutely necessary to the soup which we have just enjoyed so much. So, in like manner, are pig-tails to Chinamen." ...|$|R
50|$|Pelau, a rice-based dish, is a {{very popular}} dish in Trinidad and Tobago, as well as stewed chicken, breadfruit oil down, {{macaroni}} pie, <b>ox-tails,</b> among many others. One {{of the most popular}} Trinidadian dishes is curried duck served with either roti or rice. Local curried duck cooking competitions are often held with multiple variations being created. A simple dish to make, but difficult to master, curried Muscovy is regarded as a delicacy which can be served at all times.|$|R
6000|$|Hardly had her {{invocation}} {{trailed off}} into the [...] "Ou, ou, ou, ai, ai, ai," [...] with which it had opened, when there rushed {{over the edge of}} the hill, hard by, another figure scarcely less wild, but not so repulsive in appearance. This last was a finely-built warrior arrayed in the full panoply of savage war. With his right hand he grasped his spears, and on his left hung his large black ox-hide shield, lined on its inner side with spare assegais. From the [...] "man's" [...] ring round his head arose a single tall grey plume, robbed from the Kafir crane. His broad shoulders were bare, and beneath the arm-pits was fastened a short garment of strips of skin, intermixed with <b>ox-tails</b> of different colours. From his waist hung a rude kilt made chiefly of goat's hair, whilst round the calf of the right leg was fixed a short fringe of black <b>ox-tails.</b> As he stood before us with lifted weapon and outstretched shield, his plume bending to the breeze, and his savage aspect made more savage still by the graceful, statuesque pose, the dilated eye and warlike mould of the set features, as he stood there, an emblem and a type of the times and the things which are passing away, his feet resting on ground which he held on sufferance, and his hands grasping weapons impotent as a child's toy against those of the white man,--he who was the rightful lord of all,--what reflections did he not induce, what a moral did he not teach! ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were five}} guests, and three silver tureens of soup: viz., mock-turtle soup, <b>ox-tail</b> soup, and giblet soup. Next came a great piece of salmon, {{likewise}} {{on a silver}} dish, a roast goose, a roast saddle of mutton, roast game, {{and all sorts of}} adjuncts. In this way can a gentleman live in a spunging-house if he be inclined; and over this repast (which, in truth, I could not touch, for, let alone having dined, my heart was full of care)--over this meal my friend Gus Hoskins found me, when he received the letter that I had despatched to him.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the sun was}} up, a {{sight for}} which I thanked Heaven, for, at any rate, we {{could no longer be}} surprised. Also, with the daylight, some of my fear passed away, since {{darkness}} always makes danger twice as terrible to man and beast. Whilst we were still eating and fortifying the window-places as best we could, so as to make them difficult to enter, a single Kaffir appeared, waving above his head a stick to which was tied a white <b>ox-tail</b> as a sign of truce. I ordered that no one should fire, and when the man, who was a bold fellow, had reached the spot where the dead captain lay, called to him, asking his business, for I could speak his language well.|$|E
60|$|Still, Miss Tox was lonely, {{and at a}} loss. Her attachments, however ludicrously shown, {{were real}} and strong; and she was, as she {{expressed}} it, 'deeply hurt by the unmerited contumely she had met with from Louisa.' But {{there was no such}} thing as anger in Miss Tox's composition. If she had ambled on through life, in her soft spoken way, without any opinions, she had, at least, got so far without any harsh passions. The mere sight of Louisa Chick in the street one day, at a considerable distance, so overpowered her milky nature, that she was fain to seek immediate refuge in a pastrycook's, and there, in a musty little back room usually devoted to the consumption of soups, and pervaded by an <b>ox-tail</b> atmosphere, relieve her feelings by weeping plentifully.|$|E
60|$|At daybreak dense {{masses of}} Zulus {{were seen in}} the distance, and at six o'clock they {{approached}} the camp. They came on in their usual order, with a massive centre and advanced horns on either flank. The British were kept lying down behind the shallow trenches they had thrown up. The Zulus advanced in splendid order {{with a sort of}} dancing step. Their white and coloured shields, their crests of leopard skins and feathers, and the long <b>ox-tails</b> dangling from their necks gave them a wild and strange appearance. Every ten or fifteen yards the first line would halt, a shot would be fired, then a loud yell burst forth, and they again advanced with a humming sound, in time to which their dancing movement was kept up. The 60th, who lay opposite to the point against which they advanced, withheld their fire until the first line of skirmishers came to within 300 yards. Then a deadly sheet of flame flashed along the ridge of the shelter-trench, and a number of the Zulu warriors fell.|$|R
6000|$|I {{suppose it}} was this {{peculiarity}} of Jerusalem that had won old Petto's regard. He liked as much of anything as he could have for his money; and the expense of this creature, generally speaking, was no {{greater than that of}} a brief succinct bull pup. But there were times when he was costly. All dogs are sometimes [...] "off their feed"--will eat nothing for a whole day but a few <b>ox-tails,</b> a pudding or two, and such towelling as they can pick up in the scullery. When Jerusalem got that way, which, to do him justice, was singularly seldom, it made things awkward in the near future. For in a few days after recovering his passion for food, the effect of his former abstemiousness would begin to reach his stomach; but of course all he could then devour would work no immediate relief. This he would naturally attribute to the quality of his fare, and would change his diet a dozen times a day, his menu in the twelve working hours comprising an astonishing range of articles, from a wood-saw to a kettle of soft soap--edibles as widely dissimilar as the zenith and the nadir, which, also, he would eat. So catholic an appetite was, of course, exceptional: ordinarily Jerusalem was as narrow and illiberal as the best of us. Give him plenty of raw beef, and he would not unsettle his gastric faith by outside speculation or tentative systems.|$|R
6000|$|We {{rose and}} dressed {{ourselves}} for the fray, each {{putting on his}} chain armour shirt, for which garments at the present juncture we felt exceedingly thankful. Sir Henry went the whole length about the matter, and dressed himself like a native warrior. [...] "When you are in Kukuanaland, do as the Kukuanas do," [...] he remarked, as he drew the shining steel over his broad breast, which it fitted like a glove. Nor did he stop there. At his request Infadoos had provided him with {{a complete set of}} native war uniform. Round his throat he fastened the leopard-skin cloak of a commanding officer, on his brows he bound the plume of black ostrich feathers worn only by generals of high rank, and about his middle a magnificent moocha of white <b>ox-tails.</b> A pair of sandals, a leglet of goat's hair, a heavy battle-axe with a rhinoceros-horn handle, a round iron shield covered with white ox-hide, and the regulation number of tollas, or throwing-knives, made up his equipment, to which, however, he added his revolver. The dress was, no doubt, a savage one, but I am bound to say that I seldom saw a finer sight than Sir Henry Curtis presented in this guise. It showed off his magnificent physique to the greatest advantage, and when Ignosi arrived presently, arrayed in a similar costume, I thought to myself that I had never before seen two such splendid men.|$|R
60|$|Then the {{gigantic}} figure {{slipped off the}} karross and stood up before us, a truly alarming spectacle. It was that of an enormous man with the most entirely repulsive countenance we had ever beheld. This man's lips were as thick as a Negro's, the nose was flat, he had but one gleaming black eye, for the other was represented by a hollow in the face, and his whole expression was cruel and sensual to a degree. From the large head rose a magnificent plume of white ostrich feathers, his body was clad in a shirt of shining chain armour, whilst round the waist and right knee were the usual garnishes of white <b>ox-tail.</b> In his right hand was a huge spear, about the neck a thick torque of gold, and bound on the forehead shone dully a single and enormous uncut diamond.|$|E
6000|$|The {{weapons that}} each man bore were simple, but most effective, {{consisting}} of a short and very heavy two-edged spear with a wooden shaft, the blade being about six inches across at the widest part. These spears are not used for throwing but like the Zulu [...] "bangwan," [...] or stabbing assegai, are for close quarters only, when the wound inflicted by them is terrible. In addition to his bangwan every man carried three large and heavy knives, each knife weighing about two pounds. One knife was fixed in the <b>ox-tail</b> girdle, {{and the other two}} {{at the back of the}} round shield. These knives, which are called [...] "tollas" [...] by the Kukuanas, take the place of the throwing assegai of the Zulus. The Kukuana warriors can cast them with great accuracy to a distance of fifty yards, and it is their custom on charging to hurl a volley of them at the enemy as they come to close quarters.|$|E
60|$|The mode {{of vision}} {{is not one}} and final. The mode of vision is manifold. And the optical image is a mere {{vibrating}} blur to a child--and, indeed, to a passionate adult. In this vibrating blur the soul sees its own true correspondent. It sees, in a cow, horns and squareness, and a long tail. It sees, for a horse, a mane, and a long face, round nose, and four legs. And in each case a darkly vital presence. Now horns and squareness and a long thin <b>ox-tail,</b> these are the fearful and wonderful elements of the cow-form, which the dynamic soul perfectly perceives. The ideal-image is just outside nature, for a child--something false. In a picture, a child wants elemental recognition, and not correctness or expression, or least of all, what we call understanding. The child distorts inevitably and dynamically. But the dynamic abstraction is more than mental. If a huge eye sits {{in the middle of}} the cheek, in a child's drawing, this shows that the deep dynamic consciousness of the eye, its relative exaggeration, is the life-truth, even if it is a scientific falsehood.|$|E
6000|$|My {{guests were}} no sooner gone, than I sent for the landlady, to inquire if any court-dresses {{were to be}} had in the neighborhood. She told me plenty might {{certainly}} be had, that were suited to the monikin dimensions, but she much doubted {{whether there was a}} tail in all Leaphigh, natural or artificial, that was at all fit for a person of my stature. This was vexatious; and I was in a brown study, calling up all my resources for the occasion, when Mr. Poke entered the inn, carrying in his hand two as formidable <b>ox-tails</b> as I remember ever to have seen. Throwing one towards me, he said the lord high admiral of Leaphigh had acquainted him that there was an invitation out for the prince and himself, {{as well as for the}} governor of the former, to be present at court within an hour. He had hurried off from what he called a very good dinner, considering there was nothing solid (the captain was particularly fond of pickled pork), to let me know the honor that was intended us; and on the way home, he had fallen in with Dr. Reasono, who, on being acquainted with his errand, had not failed to point out the necessity of the whole party coming en habit de cour. Here was a dilemma, with a vengeance; for the first idea that struck the captain was, [...] "the utter impossibility of finding anything in this way, in all Leaphigh, befitting a lord high admiral of his length of keel; for, as to going in an ordinary monikin queue, why, he should look like a three-decked ship, with a brig's spar stepped for a lower mast!" [...] Dr. Reasono, however, had kindly removed the embarrassment, by conducting him to the cabinet of natural history, where three suitable appendages had been found, viz., two fine relics of oxen, [Footnote: Cauda Bovum.--BUF.] and another, a capital specimen, that had formerly been the mental lever, or, as the captain expressed it, [...] "the steering oar" [...] of a kangaroo. The latter had been sent off, express, with a kind consideration for the honor of Great Britain, to Prince Bob, who was at a villa of one of the royal family, in the neighborhood of Aggregation.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} there was more and more noise in the pile of fish, and the sound of them being torn was heard both by night and day. Some time after this it was {{necessary}} to take down some of the fish, and the man who went up on the pile saw this strange thing, that up out of the pile there came a tail, in appearance like a singed <b>ox-tail.</b> It was black and covered with hair like a seal. The man laid hold of it and pulled, and called on the others to come and help him. Others then got up on the heap, both men and women, and pulled at the tail, but all to no purpose. It seemed to them that the tail was dead, but while they tugged at it, it flew out of their hands taking the skin off the palms of those who had been holding it hardest, and no more was ever seen of the tail. The fish were then taken up and every one was found to be torn out of the skin, yet no living thing was {{to be found in the}} pile.|$|E
60|$|As {{our state}} of health varies greatly from time to time, however, so do the {{warnings}} of this last sympathetic adviser change and flicker. Sweet things are always sweet, and bitter things always bitter; vinegar is always sour, and ginger always hot in the mouth, too, whatever our {{state of health}} or feeling. But our taste for roast loin of mutton, high game, salmon cutlets, and Gorgonzola cheese varies immensely from time to time, with the passing condition of our health and digestion. In illness, and especially in sea-sickness, one gets the distaste carried to the extreme: you may eat grapes or suck an orange in the chops of the Channel, {{but you do not}} feel warmly attached to the steward who offers you a basin of greasy <b>ox-tail,</b> or consoles you with promises of ham sandwiches in half a minute. Under those two painful conditions it is the very light, fresh, and stimulating things that one can most easily swallow--champagne, soda-water, strawberries, peaches; not lobster salad, sardines on toast, green Chartreuse, or hot brandy-and-water. On the other hand, in robust health, and when hungry with exercise, you can eat fat pork with relish on a Scotch hillside, or dine off fresh salmon three days running without inconvenience. Even a Spanish stew, with plenty of garlic in it, and floating in olive oil, tastes positively delicious after a day's mountaineering in the Pyrenees.|$|E
50|$|Oxtail (occasionally spelled ox tail or <b>ox-tail)</b> is {{the culinary}} {{name for the}} tail of cattle. Formerly, it {{referred}} only to the tail of an ox or steer, a bullock (a castrated male). An oxtail typically weighs 2 to 4 lbs. (1-1.8 kg) and is skinned and cut into short lengths for sale.|$|E
50|$|He had won various {{bodybuilding}} titles such as Mr Penang Health Culture League in 1959, 1960 and 1961, Mr Body Beautiful in 1963 and Mr Penang in 1966. Mat Tarzan {{was also}} a good cook in his own right, having picked up some useful culinary skills from his father, specialising in Malay dishes such as mee bandung, <b>ox-tail</b> soup and satay which he ran a chain of food stalls in Malaysia since the 1960s to the present day.|$|E
50|$|Other popular dishes {{brought from}} Southeast Asian, and Spanish {{influences}} include afritada, asado, chorizo, empanadas, mani (roasted peanuts), paksiw (fish or pork, cooked in vinegar and water with some spices like garlic and pepper), pan de sal (bread of salt), pescado frito (fried or grilled fish), sisig, torta (omelette), kare-kare (<b>ox-tail</b> stew), kilawen, pinakbet (vegetable stew), pinapaitan, and sinigang (tamarind soup {{with a variety}} of pork, fish, or prawns). Some delicacies eaten by some Filipinos may seem unappetizing to the Western palate include balut (boiled egg with a fertilized duckling inside), longanisa (sweet sausage), and dinuguan (soup made from pork blood).|$|E
5000|$|Captain A. H. Bogardus, the {{champion}} shot, {{arrived in the}} city yesterday morning, and immediately repaired to the Louisville Hotel, where his rival, Dr. Carver is stopping. Neither of them [...] "recognized" [...] the other, although they met {{several times during the}} morning and dined at adjoining tables. Captain Bogardus remarked to a friend in a fatherly way that the [...] "young 'un" [...] seemed to be in fine form, and Dr. Carver was overheard saying as he blushed before a plate of potato salad, that [...] "the old man was looking pretty well himself." [...] Once or twice they glared politely at each other, and the scene was rather amusing. Captain Bogardus would transfix a baked apple with his fork, and then cast a quick glance at Carver, who at that moment was sipping his <b>ox-tail</b> soup, timidly eyeing the Captain over the rim of the bowl.|$|E
40|$|Duration 23 minutes. Precis: Professor Colin Hughes {{interviews}} Reginald Pollard, Labor MP, about Prime Ministers Curtin and Chifley. First {{learned of}} Curtin in 1914 in Melbourne in trade union and political circles. Curtin was a contemporary of M Blackburn, J Cain and R. S. Ross. Actually met Curtin {{when he entered}} State Parliament in 1924. In 1914 Curtin had contested the Federal seat of Balaclava against W. A. Watt. Went to Western Australia to edit "West Australian Worker". In Victoria had been active as a trade union secretary {{and editor of the}} "Timber Worker". Was a member of the socialist Party as were Blackburn, Cain, Ross and D Cameron, all who later became prominent members of the ALP and held high office in both Federal and State Government. They all realised there were better prospects of helping workers by relinquishing the Socialist party and joining the Labor Party. Curtin was a serious man. Sometimes met opposition in caucus and always handled it courteously and accepted decisions graciously. Could be withering. Was a first class leader in handling caucus. Tells story of issue of conscription during Second World War and how Curtin persuaded him to change his vote in favour of conscription. Curtin always said he owed his position as Prime Minister to those men who influenced and helped him. A modest man, never claimed anything as due to his own inherent virtues. Chifley greatly admired Stafford Cripps and Nehru, the two keenest minds he had 4 ever met. In the post-war period Chifley was prepared to go to the limit to lighten the burden for Britain whose people had suffered so much during the war. Wiped off 45 million pounds debt. Also continued the butter ration in order to help Britain and imperiled his own position in doing so. Chifley had a lively wit and great sense of humour. Food: Liked <b>ox-tail</b> and potatoes in their jackets and had an arrangement with the cook at Parliament House to be informed when thes...|$|E
