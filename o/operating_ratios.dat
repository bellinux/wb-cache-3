[...] The TG directors reacted tardily, causing many complaints about the backlogs of traffic. Eventually they did buy substantial numbers of new locomotives and freight cars, just in time to suffer the devastating effects of poor grain harvests and the business recession of the mid-late 1870s.

The gross TG profit was barely equivalent to 4-5% on its outstanding bonds, which had been sold with a guaranteed return of 7-8%. This left nothing for renewals of equipment and trackage or for the stockholders. The Grey extension to Owen Sound carried a vigorous traffic in passengers and freight, for onward carriage to the Lakehaead by steamers. The Bruce extension to Teeswater was very sparsely used in the 1870s and there were continuous efforts to devise an economic passenger service to suit the circumstances.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of Cartagena, the World Bank has {{estimated}} efficiency gains by comparing {{the evolution of the}} ratio of collected revenues to operational costs (<b>operating</b> <b>ratio)</b> on the one hand to that of the average tariff level on the other hand. The <b>operating</b> <b>ratio</b> is driven essentially by two factors: the evolution of operational costs and collection rates, which are controlled by the private operator, and the evolution of the average tariff, which is exogenous. Whenever the <b>operating</b> <b>ratio</b> increases faster than the tariff, efficiency gains are taking place. The Cartagena privatization achieved significant improvements in efficiency. This is reflected in the doubling over a decade (1995 - 2005) in the ratio of collected revenues to operational costs. At the same time, the average tariff was halved in real terms, suggesting that {{a significant portion of the}} savings achieved through efficiency gains was passed to customers.|$|R

The project capital costs together with the estimated cost of rail operation plus the cost of repaying the capital infrastructure debt were identified in a Pro Forma Income Statement for the improved railway enterprise (a designed railway company) at a given future year 2017 tonnage. The project design was built around an attempt to resolve for the lowest possible bulk cargo rates to reach a new proposed bulk cargo port south of Dakar. The target rate was <$32 a metric ton at standard gauge and somewhat higher at meter gauge.

A railway authority is recommended as a means of attracting private capital using the bonding and commercial structure of such a government of Senegal and Mali chartered body rather than a conventional concession approach. The railway feasibility was based on a variety of engineering and economic possible designs that used different rail mode market shares and different levels of railway operating efficiency (<b>operating</b> <b>ratios)</b> and different track structure safety standards. Naturally, the local African leaders will have to make the final design choices. From an economic point of view, subsidies and doners are not necessary if the traffic market share and the engineering and train operational designs are correctly matched.USTDA financed The next step is for the large shippers to meet collectively or individually with UEMOA and test the feasibility study against their specific (and often private) shipper requirements. Either the authors or UEMOA should be contacted. In the meantime, rail service is continuing in the corridor under the existing concession arrangement.|$|E

40|$|The <b>operating</b> <b>ratio</b> (OPR) {{is a key}} {{statistic}} {{in several}} modes of transportation. Historically it {{had been used to}} set rates for motor carriers and to judge railroad performance. As a basic measure of carrier profitability, it was useful in the past air transportation as a measure of airline efficiency and as a compliment to the so-called “fair rate of return ” standard used by the now defunct Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), which sunset in 1985. Defined as the <b>ratio</b> of <b>operating</b> expenses to operating revenues, it was an alternative to that standard set in the several past fare investigations when the airlines were heavily regulated. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the use of the <b>operating</b> <b>ratio</b> for a different purpose. It can be used as an indicator of air carrier risk at the operating level as it can be input into an equation that will gauge the operating volatility of a carrier or the industry. That equation states that the volatility of operating profit given a change in revenues can be measured by the following: e = 1 %/[1 -OPR] Where e is defined as the percentage change in operating profit given a 1 % change in operating revenues and t is the tax rate faced by the carrier. It is an alternative measure to the concept of the degree of financial leverage (DOL) discussed in many financial management textbooks. This paper will examine the <b>operating</b> <b>ratio</b> for the US airline industry and compare its volatility to that a large sample of other industrial and transportation firms. It will be shown that the airline industry is very high in what financial theory defines as business risk. As such, the OPR can be useful in making decisions on optimal and operating financial strategies to be followed by the carriers...|$|R
