5|$|For the new attack, Nelson was to {{take three}} ships of the line, three frigates, {{including}} Emerald, and 200 marines, for an amphibious landing outside the Spanish stronghold. The frigates would then engage the batteries to the north-east <b>of</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> while the marines stormed the town. However, a combination of strong currents and heavy Spanish fire forced the British to abandon the attack. Several further attempts were made between 22 and 25 July; although the British were able to land troops, Spanish resistance was too strong and the British had to ask for an honourable withdrawal.|$|E

5|$|While {{the mission}} towns in Paraguay flourished, the evangelization of the Guaraní (Chiriguanos) in Bolivia proved difficult. With {{encouragement}} from Agustín Gutiérrez de Arce, the governor <b>of</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz,</b> the Jesuits focused {{their efforts on}} the Chiquitania, where the Christian doctrine was more readily accepted. Between 1691 and 1760 eleven missions were founded in the area; however, fires, floods, plagues, famines and attacks by hostile tribes or slave traders caused many missions to be re-established or rebuilt. The Chiquitos missions were spared large-scale epidemics, unlike those in Paraguay, mainly because of their remote locations {{and the lack of}} transportation infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the city}} <b>of</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> already {{exhibited}} a strong conservation ethic before {{the founding of}} the university, the coincidental rise of the counterculture of the 1960s with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area. The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc. A large and growing population of politically liberal UCSC alumni changed the electorate of the town from predominantly Republican to markedly left-leaning, consistently voting against expansion measures {{on the part of both}} town and gown.|$|E

5|$|In December 1987, the Conservancy {{performed}} one of {{its first}} breed rescues when it removed a viable population <b>of</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> sheep from Santa Cruz Island. The sheep {{were in danger of}} being eradicated by The Nature Conservancy, which was working to save indigenous vegetation that the breed used as food. The first twelve lambs were removed from the island in 1988, with further animals brought to the mainland in 1991. The population now stands at 125 animals and is considered an important genetic resource due to its island heritage, which kept it isolated from other breeds and forced it to adapt to adverse conditions.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1830s and early 1840s, Rosas faced {{a series of}} major threats to his power. The Unitarians found an ally in Andrés de Santa Cruz, the ruler of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation. Rosas {{declared}} war against the Peru–Bolivian Confederation on 19 March 1837, joining the War of the Confederation between Chile and Peru–Bolivia. The Rosista army played a minor role in the conflict, {{which resulted in the}} overthrow <b>of</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> and the dissolution of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation. On 28 March 1838, France declared a blockade of the Port of Buenos Aires, eager to extend its influence over the region. Unable to confront the French, Rosas increased internal repression to forestall potential uprisings against his regime.|$|E
