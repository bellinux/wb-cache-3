Laboratory skill performance test score is correlated with higher education entrance exam score but not with students’ high school laboratory back ground. There is no significant difference in instructor’s manipulative skills among universities (p ≥ 0. 09) and instructors manipulative skills is neither correlated with qualification nor teaching experience (P≥ 0. 056). The most common method of assessment instructors’ use in the laboratory is laboratory report and identification of specimen examination (46. 4 %) and written exam and identification of specimen examination (35. 7 %). <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> courses having laboratory manuals is as low as 14. 3 %, in the new university.

40|$|The {{implemented}} algorithm uses forward based {{search that}} extends a partial feasible solution towards a complete solution. The next solution {{is derived from}} the previous solution by allocating some event and removing conflicting events from the partial schedule. Every step is guided by a heuristic that aims minimal violation of soft constraints requirements. The algorithm works in iterations. It uses two basic data structures: a set of events that are not scheduled and a partial feasible timetable. At each iteration step, the algorithm tries to improve the current partial timetable towards a complete timetable. The timetabling starts with an empty partial timetable (which is a feasible timetable), i. e. all the events are in <b>the</b> list <b>of</b> non-scheduled events. Then it goes repeatedly from one partial solution to another feasible solution until all the events are scheduled. Look now {{what is going on in}} the iteration step. First, the algorithm selects one non-scheduled event and computes the locations where the event can be allocated (locations with the hard constraint are not assumed). Every location is described by a start time (<b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slot for the event) and by a selected room. Then every location is evaluated using a heuristic function over the current partial timetable. Finally, the event is placed to the best location that may cause some conflicts with already scheduled events. Such conflicting events are removed from the timetable and they are put back to <b>the</b> list <b>of</b> non-scheduled <b>activities.</b> <b>The</b> <b>below</b> algorithm schema (Fig. 1.) is parameterised by two functions: event selection and location selection.

There exists a direct competition between NO and O 2 for Pt free sites which is very much in favour of NO, and therefore, NO reduction selectively takes place over hydrocarbon combustion. NO and C 3 H 6 are involved in <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> partially oxidised hydrocarbon species. O 2 is essential for <b>the</b> oxidation <b>of</b> these intermediates closing the catalytic cycle. NO 2 is not observed in the gas phase. Above Tmax, at 230 °C, C 3 H 6 ads coverage is negligible and the surface is mainly covered by Oads produced by <b>the</b> dissociative adsorption <b>of</b> O 2. NO 2 is observed in gas phase and carbon deposits are formed at the catalyst surface. From these results, <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> Pt-beta catalyst at Tmax is inferred. The reaction proceeds through <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> partially oxidised active intermediates (CxHyOzNw) from C 3 H 6 ads and NOads. <b>The</b> combustion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intermediates with O 2 (g) frees the Pt active sites so the reaction can continue. Temperature has a positive effect on the surface reaction producing active intermediates. On <b>the</b> contrary, formation <b>of</b> NOads and C 3 H 6 ads are not favoured by an increase in temperature. Temperature has also a positive effect on <b>the</b> dissociation <b>of</b> O 2 to form Oads, consequently, <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> NO 2 is favoured by temperature through the oxygen dissociation.

50|$|After their {{apparent}} success the Girrmann group commandeered {{the path}} and refined the process with professionalism. They executed a complicated plan that included two students, Dieter Wohlfahrt and a student codenamed ‘Langer’ (tall in German). ‘Langer’ would ride a Vespa to the East, and Wohlfahrt would drive a vehicle over <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manhole cover (to conceal <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>below).</b> They then together would remove the manhole cover {{and wait for the}} first groups assigned to come. After the first group entered into the sewers, ‘Langer’ would ride back to West Berlin and inform them that the first group was on the way. After the last group and a few extra minutes for latecomers, Wohlfahrt would close the sewer cover and drive back to West Berlin. This plan was effective, efficient, and simple. The West German senator Lipschitz provided the volunteers with the same wading boots that <b>the</b> Berlin department <b>of</b> sanitation used for working in the sewers.|$|R
40|$|Measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> net {{photosynthetic}} (P-N), respiration (R) and transpiration (E) rates, leaf conductances (g(H 20)) and intercellular CO 2 concentrations (C-i), {{along with}} the transmission electron microscopy were utilized in order to study differences in photosynthetic traits of transgenic and wild-type (Wt) potato. plants. We used transgenic plants expressing different levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chloroplastic isoform <b>of</b> fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate phosphatase (FBPase), which had been created via the mRNA antisense technique. A significant reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> P-N was found only with FBPase <b>activities</b> <b>below</b> 36 % compared to the Wt, and under irradiances that exceeded 300 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1). Progressive attenuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FBPase <b>activity</b> caused further P-N reduction. The CO 2 compensation concentration and compensation irradiance were identical in the transgenic and Wt plants. Under anoxic conditions a 30 % increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> P-N occurred in all the plants. The R during the dark period was similar both in the Wt and FBPase-antisense plants. The size and number of starch grains were significantly lower in plants with <b>the</b> FBPase <b>activities</b> <b>below</b> 36 %. Shift to a higher amount of small grana stacks occurred within chloroplasts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transgenic plants...|$|R
