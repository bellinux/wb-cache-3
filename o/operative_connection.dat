50|$|Kim Knott focuses {{specifically}} on the secular sacred, in her discussion of secular spirituality. More specifically, Knott focuses {{on the possibility of}} experiencing the sacred outside the context of institutionalized religion. She believes that the sacred functions both within and outside of a theological context through the beliefs of individual persons. Knott deconstructs the common conceptional separation of the sacred from the profane. She argues that the concept of religion should not be conflated with the concept of the sacred, and that the concept of the secular should not be conflated with the concept of the profane. Throughout the enlightenment this separation between religion and the spiritual has occurred, as wilderness sites, marshes, coves, and other sites have been called sacred or spiritual places, without having religious influence or belonging to a religion. In this understanding the sacred is based in nature as these sacred sites serve in an individuals spatial sacred experience. This is how Knott breaks down the sacred experience, as it is achieved through the individuals embodiment, spatiality, and the awareness of ones the body and the spaces inside and around it. As these the sacred as the basis of the sacred as it becomes an <b>operative</b> <b>connection</b> within boundary crossing situations taking place inside and outside the human body and the inhabited territory.|$|E

40|$|The therapy {{of acute}} ischemic stroke {{remains an open}} {{challenge}} for the clinicians and is closely connected to the ready acknowledgment of symptoms, to the promptness of the instrumental diagnosis and consequently to the rapidity of the pharmacological intervention. Although several studies have validated the effectiveness and the safety profileof the intravenous fibrinolytic treatment, {{the number of patients}} who benefit of such therapeutic opportunity is still too little. This data is partially due to the delay within patients arrive to the hospital and to the doubts of the physicians on the possible collateral effects, but it is also related to logistic and organizational-managerial problematic of the patient with acute stroke. These last ones mainly derive from the deficiency on the national territory of dedicated structures (Stroke Unit), from the absence of <b>operative</b> <b>connections</b> between the 118 -service and the Stroke Unit, from the delay of the neurologist calling in the emergency room that does not allow an adapted diagnostic evaluation of the ischemic event. The spread of the intravenous fibrinolysis must therefore necessarily pass through the creation of participation protocols between hospitals with stroke unit and primary aid, and between department of emergency/ urgency and staff of the stroke unit also previewing the creation of professional figures like those of the urgency neurologist that could have the full right of the management and the treatment of cerebral ischemic pathology...|$|R

30|$|Resilience {{thinking}} has {{taken as a}} goals the achievement of a robust and extensive participation {{in the development of}} change-oriented strategies and the fostering of spread knowledge and learning in communities and it has considered change and uncertainty as intrinsic factors of systems.

The second one adopts as strictly as possible the “learning by doing” criterion to deal with situations of uncertainty (Armitage et al. 2009). The third one is a synthesis of both methods because it is a flexible resource management system that allows to learn from your own actions and change them and it is therefore very useful in governing long-term processes where stakeholders are self-organizing and share managerial responsibilities with public staffs (Olsson et al. 2004).|$|E

40|$|A {{pathological}} {{study was}} carried out for clinical evaluation of gastrectomy combined with resection of {{the tail of the}} pancreas and the spleen for a radical cure in cancer of the stomach. This statistical survey covers 1) an investigation in cancerous invation of the adjacent organs with 367 cases suffering from gastric cancer and 29 removed specimens, and 2) a systematic observation of lymphatic drainage of the stomach, both normal and cancerous cases, by means of pontamine sky blue during operation and histological study of 20 removed specimens. In this <b>connection,</b> <b>operative</b> and followup results were also evaluated. What follow are results of thesestudies: 1) Infiltrative adhesion to the tail of the pancreas is the most frequent event in cancer of the cardia or the body of the stomach. In this situation, combined resection of the tail of the pancreas must of necessity be executed. 2) In the posterior wall of the normal stomach, especially in the cardiac segment, close communications were 2 ̆ 7 confirmed not only with regional lymph nodes but also with retroperitoneal lymphatic system {{in the vicinity of the}} pancreas and the spleen. On the other hand, retrograde lymphatic drainage. is the common event in cancer of the stomach, which enforces us the enlargement of resection of malignant areas for a radical cure. This is especially true in the case of cardiac cancer in which much closer connection with retroperitoneal lymph nodes is found. It is quite obvious that the complete removal of lymph nodes involved is attainable only by en masse resection of these two adjacent organs. 3) On the other hand, operative mortality rate and follow-up results of our patients undergoing surgical treatment for cancer of the stomach indicated a definite superiority of this combined resection over the gastrectomy itself. These points mentioned above offer us unequivocal grounds of the necessity of this operative procedure for radical cure in more or less advanced cancer of the stomach...|$|R
40|$|Between {{the end of}} the 1960 s and the 1980 s, {{the city}} of Paris faced a period of {{extensive}} urban transformation and a change in the strategies of this transformation at the same time, in comparison with the heroic Trente Glorieuses. The analysis of these architectural and urban changes and the processes of implementation, are often based on a morphological or a policiy-oriented perspective. Moreover, in France, the study of decision-making processes and urban transformation falls within the scope of social sciences. This has resulted in an unfortunate separation of academic approaches: one focusing on finding the link between the theories of the architectural community or policies and the projects, while the other taking the already transformed urban space {{as a starting point for}} social analysis. This research aims to investigate the gap between these two methodological approaches, both influential in France during the 1970 s and 1980 s, through an urban history-oriented study. The main goal of the thesis is to explore the role of the Atelier Parisien d'Urbanisme (hereafter APUR), a bureaucratic entity charged of several different tasks, within the shift from urban renovation to urban form, concerning the city of Paris. Between 1967 and 1989, the APUR had an essential part in translating the aforementioned shift into <b>operative</b> terms, in <b>connection</b> with those institutions that had the power to transform large areas of the French capital. This was possible thanks to a negotiation process involving different institutions, as well as architects and urban designers, in which APUR took a major role. In this context the research will also investigate the relationship between the cultural references and the processes through which urban spaces have been converted. Two case studies allow an analysis of these urban changes and of the role played by the APUR: the transformations of the Halles Centrales of Paris, and the projects for the secteur de la Villette, especially those for Place Stalingrad (Bernard Huet, 1985 - 89) and Parc de la Villette during the first competition organized by APUR (1976). These two cases are intertwined. On one hand, they illustrate a cultural point of view; on the other hand, they give an account of institutional and political processes, showing a transformation that occurred throughout the whole city. Finally, they cross the trajectory of some of the most emblematic figures in French architecture at that time. One of them was Bernard Huet, a teacher, theorist, critic and designer who played an fundamental role in the definition of a new cultural paradigm. The research shows a change in the process of transformation of urban space in Paris. The practices shifted from projects which were generated through vivid debate, strongly linked to contemporary French social sciences, to a later standardization of urban projects and urban imaginaire and a cultural legitimation of APUR. The central role of APUR in the two case studies is analysed by comparing the Atelier's archives, the ones of the architects involved in the urban projects as well as the ministerial and presidential ones. Oral sources are restricted to a control role. In the end this work aims to highlight the process of city-making trough the role of a public bureaucracy within urban transformations: an active contribution which led, between 1967 and 1989, to the definition of the contemporary conception of the city of Pari...|$|R
40|$|A {{confluence}} of clues {{from a range}} of academic topics suggests that minds localization in nature consists of relativistically moving microphysical particles, whose motion is physiologically modulated. Here those clues are shown to imply that the localization of the operations of observers (minds or existentialities) in nature are the actions carriers of a force field, which action carriers are slightly slowed from near-c speed motion by electroneurobiological variations in brain physiology – thus gating through relativistic time dilation the observer’s time resolution and putting her or him in <b>operative</b> <b>connection</b> or disconnection with the cerebral representation of the surrounding occurrences. In this scenario, minds as well as sensory knowledge acquire a precise definition and appear situated in a particular point of causal sequences. Summary in general terms: Why were minds selected to turn accidents into opportunities, i. e., to progress toward biological goals through appropriate steps for which the instructions are nonetheless undefinable? Minds appear situated in certain force-carrying particles whose speed sets wakefulness or sleep. Through this force, observable by its influence on the evolutionary process, minds and bodies interact. Physical actions impinging on a mind generate in it physical reactions whose causal efficiency gets exhausted, so that the reactions cannot continue their causal series. In exchange, they become sensorially known. On them the mind then takes efficient initiatives – whereby minds acquire intellectual development – generating changes. The broken causal sequence seems to be what enables minds for their biological role. Summary in technical terms: Observers’ localization in nature might be relativistically moving particles whose motion is physiologically modulated. Transdisciplinary clues imply that speed variation is imposed onto some action carriers of a force field by their coupling with intensity variations of an overlapping field. The operations of observers (minds or existentialities) in nature seem localized in such actions carriers, slightly slowed from near-c speed motion by electroneurobiological variations – which thus gate the observer’s time resolution and put her or him in <b>operative</b> <b>connection</b> or disconnection with the surroundings. Thereby minds and sensory knowledge appear in a particular point of causal sequences.
