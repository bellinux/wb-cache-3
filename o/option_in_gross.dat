However, the report noted {{that there was little}} difference in costs between the government paying all and the ETS with free allocation, as all the model results indicated small reductions (-0.1% and -0.4%) <b>in</b> <b>Gross</b> National Disposable Income compared to ‘business as usual’.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>Gross.</b> By contrast, {{a profit}} <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> can be {{assigned}} or otherwise transferred by its owner. Courts will construe a profit as being <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> unless the profit is expressly designated as being appurtenant. Therefore, profits by prescription will virtually always be profits <b>in</b> <b>gross.</b> Like a commercial easement <b>in</b> <b>gross,</b> a profit <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> is completely alienable. Profits can also be exclusive (guaranteeing {{the owner of the}} profit that no other person will be given the right to collect the specified resources on the land).|$|R

30|$|In section IV, we {{analyze the}} decline <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> worker flows (hires and separations), {{employing}} some helpful identities that relate gross worker flows to gross job flows (job creation and job destruction), {{as well as}} to job-to-job flows. We find that the decline <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> job flows can be described as a narrowing of the distribution of employer growth rates, but this change in the distribution of gross job flows only explains {{about a third of the}} decline <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> worker flows. This implies that whatever economic forces are driving the declines <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> job flows, there are different forces that are driving the declines <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> worker flows. Analyzing the relationship between gross worker flows and job-to-job flows, we find that declines in both short-duration jobs and job-to-job flows are driving the declines <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> worker flows.|$|R
