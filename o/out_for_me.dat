He then joined the 138th Battery Royal Field Artillery. He {{wanted to be a}} pilot so he paid for private lessons in the Bristol Flying School at Brooklands and gained his aviators' certificate on 12 July 1912. He met Agatha Miller when he was invited to a ball on 12 October 1912 by Lady Clifford at her grand home Ugbrooke House in Chudleigh. A description of her meeting with Christie is given by Agatha in her autobiography:Christie came my way quite soon in the dance. He was a tall, fair young man, with crisp curly hair, a rather interesting nose, turned up not down, and a great air of careless confidence about him. He was introduced to me, asked for a couple of dances, and said that his friend Griffiths had told him to look <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> We got on together very well; he danced splendidly and I danced again several more times with him. I enjoyed the evening thoroughly.|$|E

500|$|Liverpool manager Bill Shankly {{was asked}} after the match whether Leeds United had failed during the season: [...] "Failed? Second in the championship. Cup finalists. Ninety percent of {{managers}} would pray for 'failures' like that." [...] Leeds manager Don Revie was disappointed to lose, but praised his players' efforts in defeat: [...] "There's {{no doubt about}} it, the better side won, but, at least the lads played their guts <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> He admitted it was disappointing to finish second in both the League and FA Cup: [...] "It's a bit disappointing to finish second in both Cup and League, but {{we have had a}} wonderful first season back in Division One, and I am very pleased with the team." [...] Captain Collins echoed his manager's sentiments: [...] "We have had a great season, but lost both honours. We shall be having a go again next season." ...|$|E

500|$|On 24 November 2014, ASO {{announced}} that for time {{the first time}} in Tour history the department of Manche would host the 2016 edition's opening race stages (known as the Grand Départ), before further details of the first three stages held in Manche were released [...] on 9 December 2014. On 15 January 2015, the organisers confirmed that the race would visit Andorra, for the fifth time in history; after the 1964, 1993, 1997 and 2009 editions. The principality hosted the finish of the ninth stage, the first rest day and start of stage ten. The entire route was unveiled by race director Christian Prudhomme on 20 October 2015 at the Palais des Congrès in Paris. The defending champion Chris Froome said after the route was {{announced that}} he expected the course to suit him better than the previous year's course. [...] "I think it's going to take a complete cyclist– but the stage that certainly stands <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> is Mont Ventoux", he added.|$|E
500|$|Also in 1996, Murphy began {{studying}} law at University College Cork (UCC), but he failed {{his first year}} exams because, as he put it, he had [...] "no ambitions to do it". Not only was he busy with his band, but {{he has said that}} he knew within days after starting at UCC that law was not what he wanted to do. After seeing Corcadorca's stage production of , directed by Kiernan, acting had begun to pique his interest. His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society's amateur production of Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, also starring Irish American comedian, Des Bishop. Murphy also played the lead in a UCC Drama production of Little Shop of Horrors, which was performed in the Cork Opera House. According to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women, not to begin an acting career. Nonetheless, he began to move away from working as a rock musician, about which he later remarked, [...] "I think there's {{such a thing as a}} performance gene. If it's in your DNA it needs to come <b>out.</b> <b>For</b> <b>me</b> it originally came out through music, then segued into acting and came out through there. I always needed to get up and perform." ...|$|E

The records that stick <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> the most are when we went into it thinking, [...] "Let's just do great work. Let's not chase radio. We're not trying to get radio hits.

Let's just do good work, because we love doing what we do, and we get to make music to it.|$|E
2500|$|Kahane {{argued that}} there was a glory in Jewish destiny, which came through the {{observance}} of the Torah. He also noted that, [...] "Democracy and Judaism are not the same thing." [...] Kahane also stressed the view that a Jewish state and a Western democracy were incompatible, since a Western democracy is religion-blind, and a Jewish state is religion-oriented by its very name. He also warned of the danger of non-Jewish citizens becoming a majority and voting against the Jewish character of the state: [...] "The question is as follows: if the Arabs settle among us and make enough children to become a majority, will Israel continue to be a Jewish state? Do we have to accept that the Arab majority will decide?" [...] "Western democracy has to be ruled <b>out.</b> <b>For</b> <b>me</b> that's cut and dried: there's no question of setting up democracy in Israel, because democracy means equal rights for all, irrespective of racial or religious origins." ...|$|E

I've tried {{to look back and}} see if a song just came out of a sunny day. [...] "Oh, today I'm going to write a song." [...] That's never been the case for me. It's always whether I'm just overwhelmed with some emotion. Whether it be I'm happy, I'm sad, I've fallen in love, I've fallen out of love. I'm lonely, I'm scared. Whatever it be that day. If I'm like a volcano and I'm about to explode, I better run to an instrument because it's about to come <b>out.</b> <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> I don't really go back. I probably should. I have a bajillion pieces of songs. But I seem to just write in one sitting. There's very few occasions where I've gone back and worked on songs later. Normally, I sit down, the song comes out and I'm done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Westbrook {{has said}} that the cast and crew became like a second family to her, with the roles in the soap {{mirroring}} their relationships off-screen. In her autobiography she comments, [...] "Sid [...] and I became very close [...] we were as thick as thieves. When we weren't shooting together we'd hang out [...] Once Sid and I got so bored hanging around on set that we decided to take the milk float for a spin around Albert Square, but Sid drove it too fast and turned it over [...] we couldn't stop laughing, but the producers didn't seem to share our amusement. We were seriously told off that day." [...] She has described other actors like Michelle Gayle, Letitia Dean, Adam Woodyatt and Nick Berry like brothers and sisters, and has said she was very close to older cast members such as June Brown, Wendy Richard, Mike Reid and Gillian Taylforth. She has also revealed that her off-screen relationship with actors McFadden and Kemp mirrored her character's on-screen one: [...] "In the soap they were my older brothers, always looking <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> making sure I didn't get into trouble, and off set they were exactly the same." ...|$|E
