5|$|People {{have lived}} in the Everglades region for {{thousands}} of years. Within the past 100years however, they have changed the natural landscape dramatically. Settlement of urban areas in South Florida was facilitated by large drainage projects intended to create more land. The drainage was often implemented without a full understanding of the intricacies of ecosystems and shaping processes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades.</b> The South Florida metropolitan area grew exponentially, causing problems in ecosystems throughout the Everglades. By the 1990s, the diminishing quality of life in many of these urban areas was linked to the degraded local environment. The State of Florida and the U.S. government devised and passed a plan in 2000 to restore as much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> to pre-drainage conditions as possible. It is the costliest and most comprehensive environmental restoration project in history.|$|E
5|$|Although sawgrass and sloughs are the {{enduring}} geographical icons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades,</b> other ecosystems {{are just as}} vital, and the borders marking them are subtle or nonexistent. Pinelands and tropical hardwood hammocks are located throughout the sloughs; the trees, rooted in soil inches above the peat, marl, or water, support a variety of wildlife. The oldest and tallest trees are cypresses, whose roots are specially adapted to grow underwater {{for months at a}} time. The Big Cypress Swamp is well known for its 500-year-old cypresses, though cypress domes can appear throughout the Everglades. As the fresh water from Lake Okeechobee makes its way to Florida Bay, it meets salt water from the Gulf of Mexico; mangrove forests grow in this transitional zone, providing nursery and nesting conditions for many species of birds, fish, and invertebrates. The marine environment of Florida Bay is also considered part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> because its sea grasses and aquatic life are attracted to the constant discharge of fresh water.|$|E
5|$|The Seminole Wars {{increased}} the U.S. {{military presence in}} the Everglades, which resulted in the exploration and mapping of many regions that had not previously been recorded. The military officers who had done the mapping and charting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> were approached by Thomas Buckingham Smith in 1848 to consult on the feasibility of draining the region for agricultural use.|$|E
50|$|Graham also {{launched}} {{the most extensive}} environmental protection program in the state's history, focused on preserving endangered lands. During his tenure {{thousands of acres of}} threatened and environmentally important lands were brought into state ownership for permanent protection. His keystone accomplishment was <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Save <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> program, which has now been joined by the federal government in a commitment to restore <b>the</b> <b>Everglades.</b>|$|R

5|$|Humans {{have also}} {{adversely}} impacted the ecology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> by introducing numerous invasive species, which may prey on or compete with native species. A spectacular and particularly damaging {{example of this}} phenomenon is the recent proliferation of the Burmese python in the Everglades, as well as elsewhere in Florida. First observed in the wild in 1979 and not again until 1995, they have increased alarmingly since 2000. By 2011, decreases of 87.5%, 94.1%, 98.9% and 99.3% in sightings of bobcats, white-tailed deer, opossums and raccoons, respectively, were reported in park road surveys, while rabbits were no longer being seen at all.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} for {{thousands}} of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to drain the wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> is a politically charged issue in South Florida.|$|E
5|$|Rising {{sea levels}} caused by global warming are another {{threat to the}} future of the park. Since 1932, ocean levels at Key West have {{steadily}} risen over , which could have disastrous consequences for land so close to the ocean. It is estimated that within 500 years freshwater habitats in the Everglades National Park will be obliterated by salt water, leaving only the northernmost portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades.</b> Cost estimates for raising or replacing the Tamiami Trail and Alligator Alley with bridges are in the hundreds of millions of dollars.|$|E
40|$|Periphyton is an {{abundant}} and ubiquitous feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Florida <b>Everglades,</b> often forming thick mats that blanket shallow sediments and submersed plants. They {{are considered to}} be primary ecosystem engineers in <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> by forming and stabilizing soils, controlling concentrations of nutrients and gases, and supplying food and structure for other organisms. Distribution patterns are related to underlying physicochemical gradients as well as those hydrologic changes imposed by water management. Because communities respond rapidly to environmental change, their use has been advocated to provide indication of system degradation or restoration. The authors review studies on <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> periphyton in <b>the</b> <b>Everglades,</b> highlighting major findings relevant to water management, and also areas where additional exploration is necessary...|$|R
500|$|The 1926 Miami Hurricane and the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane caused {{widespread}} devastation {{and flooding}} which prompted <b>the</b> Army Corps <b>of</b> Engineers {{to construct a}} dike around Lake Okeechobee. The four-story wall cut off water from <b>the</b> <b>Everglades.</b> Floods from hurricanes in 1947 motivated the U.S. Congress to establish the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project (C), responsible for constructing [...] of canals and levees, hundreds of pumping stations and other water control devices. The C established Water Conservation Areas (WCAs) in 37% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>Everglades,</b> which acted as reservoirs providing excess water to the South Florida metropolitan area, or flushing it into the Atlantic Ocean or <b>the</b> Gulf <b>of</b> Mexico. <b>The</b> C also established <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> Agricultural Area (EAA), which grows <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> sugarcane crops in the United States. When the EAA was first established, it encompassed approximately 27% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>Everglades.</b>|$|R
5|$|At only 5,000 years <b>of</b> age, <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> {{is a young}} {{region in}} {{geological}} terms. Its ecosystems are in constant flux as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interplay <b>of</b> three factors: <b>the</b> type and amount <b>of</b> water present, <b>the</b> geology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region, and the frequency and severity of fires.|$|R
5|$|The {{metropolitan}} areas of Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach {{are located on}} a rise in elevation along the eastern coast of Florida, called the Eastern Coastal Ridge, that was formed as waves compressed ooids into a single formation. Along the western border of the Big Cypress Swamp is the Immokolee Ridge (or Immokolee Rise), a slight rise of compressed sand that divides the runoff between the Caloosahatchee River and The Big Cypress. This slight rise in elevation on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> creates a basin, and forces water that overflows Lake Okeechobee to creep toward the southwest.|$|E
5|$|A {{commission}} {{appointed by}} Governor Chiles published {{a report in}} 1995 stating that South Florida was unable to sustain its growth, and {{the deterioration of the}} environment was negatively affecting daily life for residents in South Florida. The environmental decline was predicted to harm tourism and commercial interests if no actions were taken to halt current trends. Results of an eight-year study that evaluated the C were submitted to the United States Congress in 1999. The report warned that if no action was taken the region would rapidly deteriorate. A strategy called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was enacted to restore portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades,</b> Lake Okeechobee, the Caloosahatchee River, and Florida Bay to undo the damage of the past 50years. It would take 30years and cost $7.8billion to complete. Though the plan was passed into law in 2000, it has been compromised by politics and funding problems.|$|E
5|$|A vast {{marshland}} {{could only}} have been formed due to the underlying rock formations in southern Florida. The floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> formed between 25million and 2million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the next. The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present.|$|E
25|$|In California, {{endosulfan}} contamination {{from the}} San Joaquin Valley has {{been implicated in}} <b>the</b> extirpation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain yellow-legged frog from parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nearby Sierra Nevada. In Florida, levels <b>of</b> contamination <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> and Biscayne Bay are high enough to {{pose a threat to}} some aquatic organisms.|$|R

30|$|Numerous fire {{projects}} have been conducted in a diversity <b>of</b> landscapes across <b>the</b> <b>Everglades,</b> such as <b>the</b> River <b>of</b> Grass prescribed fire plan for the wet prairie and sawgrass marsh ecosystems, the Pinelands burn plan, the mangrove-marsh ecotone fire project, and the fire project in Water Conservation Area 2 A (WCA 2 A) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>Everglades</b> (Spier and Snyder 1998, Beckage et al. 2005, Qian et al. 2009). However, while most of these {{projects have}} focused on restoring native plant species, {{little is known about}} the fire effects on nutrient biogeochemistry, let alone on the N cycle that has been ignored across <b>the</b> whole <b>Everglades</b> ecosystem (Miao and Sklar 1998, Miao and Carstenn 2006, Qian et al. 2009, Inglett et al. 2011).|$|R
5|$|In 1817, Andrew Jackson invaded Florida {{to hasten}} its {{annexation}} to the United States, in {{what became known}} as the First Seminole War. After Florida became a U.S. territory in 1821, conflicts between settlers and the Seminole increased as the former tried to acquire lands. The Second Seminole War lasted from 1835 to 1842, and afterward, the US forcibly removed about 3,000 Seminole and 800 Black Seminole to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), west of the Mississippi River. Many others died in the war. Conflict broke out again in the Third Seminole War from 1855 to 1859, when a few hundred Seminole fought off US forces from the swamps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades.</b> The US finally decided to leave them alone, as they could not dislodge them even after this protracted and expensive warfare.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{have noted}} that fires appear in cycles {{associated}} {{with those of the}} hydroperiods. The first cycle is the annual wet-season fires that occur with rapid frequency during the summer, but are quickly extinguished. Dry-season fires are rarer {{due to the lack of}} lightning, but their damage may be more pervasive. A longer fire cycle spanning ten to fourteen years coincides with similar water cycles affected by global climate conditions. Fires in this cycle may be numerous and have little effect, or rare and have catastrophic consequences. The third cycle appears in a 550-year frequency associated with severe drought. Layers of charcoal have been detected inside peat in parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades,</b> indicating the region endured severe fires for years at a time, although this trend seems to have abated since the last occurrence around 940 BCE.|$|E
50|$|Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve is a Florida State Park {{just west}} of Copeland, Florida. It {{is located in the}} Fakahatchee Strand, a thread of forested strand (swamp) in Big Cypress, a section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Florida <b>Everglades</b> off SR 29.|$|R
50|$|Benjamin Lainhart {{became the}} first {{permanent}} resident <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western shore <b>of</b> Lake Worth in 1875, building a cabin {{in what is now}} the El Cid neighborhood near present-day Barcelona Road with help from his cousin, William Lainhart. For thousands <b>of</b> years, <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> had isolated <b>the</b> area from <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> Florida. There is no evidence of permanent settlement in the area by the indigenous Jeaga, Tequesta or the Seminole Indian Tribes.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{environmental}} considerations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Florida <b>everglades</b> ecosystem, water drainage is strictly {{regulated by the}} East Shore Water Control District. Excess water drains from the Airport onto Closter Farms, located adjacent to the airport. The County compensates Closter Farms for drainage services that Closter's provides to take care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excess drainage.|$|R
5|$|The {{indigenous}} people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> region {{arrived in the}} Florida peninsula {{of what is now}} the United States approximately 14,000 to 15,000years ago, probably following large game. The Paleo-Indians found an arid landscape that supported plants and animals adapted to prairie and xeric scrub conditions. Large animals became extinct in Florida around 11,000 years ago. Climate changes 6,500years ago brought a wetter landscape. The Paleo-Indians slowly adapted to the new conditions. Archaeologists call the cultures that resulted from the adaptations Archaic peoples. They were better suited for environmental changes than their ancestors, and created many tools with the resources they had. Approximately 5,000years ago, the climate shifted again to cause the regular flooding from Lake Okeechobee that gave rise to the Everglades ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} bedrock or limestone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> basin {{affects the}} hydroperiod, {{or how long}} an area within the region stays flooded throughout the year. Longer hydroperiods are possible in areas that were submerged beneath seawater {{for longer periods of}} time, while the geology of Florida was forming. More water is held within the porous ooids and limestone than older types of rock that spent more time above sea level. A hydroperiod of ten months or more fosters growth of sawgrass, whereas a shorter hydroperiod of six months or less promotes beds of periphyton, a growth of algae and other microscopic organisms. There are only two types of soil in the Everglades, peat and marl. Where there are longer hydroperiods, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Where periphyton grows, the soil develops into marl, which is more calcitic in composition.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of efforts to control water {{resources}} in Florida and projects to drain the Everglades during the early and mid-20th century, water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to canal construction, most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater, but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural water flow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades.</b> Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of water flow into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of {{water out of the}} southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay. The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short, heavy discharges through drainage canals.|$|E
500|$|Arthur R. Marshall led {{the efforts}} to undo the damage. According to Douglas, Marshall was {{successful}} in portraying <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> from <b>the</b> Kissimmee Chain <b>of</b> Lakes to Florida Bayincluding the atmosphere, climate, and limestoneas a single organism. Rather than remaining <b>the</b> preserve <b>of</b> conservation organizations, <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> restoring <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> became a priority for politicians. Douglas observed, [...] "Marshall accomplished <b>the</b> extraordinary magic <b>of</b> taking <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bleeding-hearts category forever". At <b>the</b> insistent urging <b>of</b> Marshall, newly elected Governor Bob Graham announced <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Save Our Everglades" [...] campaign in 1983, and in 1985 Graham lifted <b>the</b> first shovel <b>of</b> backfill for a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C-38 canal. Within a year the area was covered with water returning to its original state. Graham declared {{that by the year}} 2000, <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> would resemble its predrainage state as much as possible. The Kissimmee River Restoration Project was approved by Congress in the Water Resources Development Act <b>of</b> 1992. <b>The</b> project was estimated to cost $578million to convert only [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal; the cost was designed to be divided between <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> Florida and <b>the</b> U.S. government, with the state being responsible for purchasing land to be restored. A project manager for <b>the</b> Army Corps <b>of</b> Engineers explained in 2002, [...] "What we're doing on this scale is going to be taken to a larger scale when we do <b>the</b> restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Everglades". The entire project is estimated to be completed by 2011.|$|R
500|$|In 1948 Congress {{approved}} the Central and Southern Florida Project for Flood Control and Other Purposes (C) and consolidated <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> Drainage District and the Okeechobee Flood Control District under this. The C used four methods in flood management: levees, water storage areas, canal improvements, and large pumps to assist gravity. Between 1952 and 1954 {{in cooperation with}} <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> Florida it built a levee [...] long between <b>the</b> eastern <b>Everglades</b> and suburbs from Palm Beach to Homestead, and blocked <b>the</b> flow <b>of</b> water into populated areas. Between 1954 and 1963 it divided <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> into basins. In <b>the</b> northern <b>Everglades</b> were Water Conservation Areas (WCAs), and <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> Agricultural Area (EAA) bordering to <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> Lake Okeechobee. In <b>the</b> southern <b>Everglades</b> was Everglades National Park. Levees and pumping stations bordered each WCA, which released water in drier times and removed it and pumped it to the ocean or Gulf of Mexico in times <b>of</b> flood. <b>The</b> WCAs took up about 37percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>Everglades.</b>|$|R
30|$|We {{refer to}} the WCAs and LUs collectively as our areas of {{interest}} (AOI) to efficiently distinguish them from the potential study area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire Greater <b>Everglades.</b>|$|R
5|$|Attention {{to water}} quality was focused in South Florida in 1986 when a {{widespread}} algal bloom occurred in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee. The bloom was discovered {{to be the}} result of fertilizers from the Everglades Agricultural Area. Although laws stated in 1979 that the chemicals used in the EAA should not be deposited into the lake, they were flushed into the canals that fed the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and eventually pumped into the lake. Microbiologists discovered that, although phosphorus assists plant growth, it destroys periphyton, one of the basic building blocks of marl in the Everglades. Marl is one of two types of Everglades soil, along with peat; it is found where parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> are flooded for shorter periods of time as layers of periphyton dry. Most of the phosphorus compounds also rid peat of dissolved oxygen and promote algae growth, causing native invertebrates to die, and sawgrass to be replaced with invasive cattails that grow too tall and thick for birds and alligators to nest in. Tested water showed 500parts per billion (ppb) of phosphorus near sugarcane fields. State legislation in 1987 mandated a 40% reduction of phosphorus by 1992.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{is another}} {{important}} element in the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades.</b> The majority are caused by lightning strikes from thunderstorms during the wet season. Their effects are largely superficial, and serve to foster further plant growth: sawgrass will burn above water, but the roots are preserved. Fire in the sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes and trees, and releases nutrients from decaying plant matter more efficiently than decomposition. Large burned areas also affect waterflow, since wind and water are undeterred by the eradicated sawgrass; water may flow {{two to three times}} faster in recently burned areas. During the wet season only dead plant matter and the tips of plants are burned; however, the effects of fire are much more significant in the dry season, as fire may be fed by organic peat and burn deeply, destroying root systems. The only impediment to the spread of fire in the Everglades is the presence of water. It takes around 225years for one foot (0.3m) of peat to develop, but the peat is not as dense as it should be for the 5,000years of the Everglades' existence. Scientists point to fire as the reason.|$|E
5|$|Some of the driest {{land in the}} Everglades is pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, {{located in}} the highest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> with little to no hydroperiod. Some floors, however, may have flooded {{solution}} holes or puddles {{for a few months}} at a time. The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii). Pineland communities require fire to maintain them, and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire. The sandy floor of the pine forest is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds. A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines. The understory shrubs in pine rocklands are the fire-resistant saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and West Indian lilac (Tetrazygia bicolor). The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are the herbs, of which there are two dozen species. These plants contain tubers and other mechanisms that allow them to sprout quickly after being charred.|$|E
50|$|Book Three {{is based}} on Bone By Bone. In this first-person section, Edgar Watson tells his own life story, from his {{childhood}} in South Carolina to his fatal encounter with his neighbors on <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Florida <b>Everglades.</b> By using this chronology, Matthiessen ends the book with the same scene in which it began told from opposite points of view.|$|R
500|$|The {{same year}} {{the park was}} dedicated, two hurricanes and the wet season caused [...] to fall on South Florida. Though there were no human casualties, {{agricultural}} interests lost approximately $59million. In 1948 Congress approved the Central and Southern Florida Project for Flood Control and Other Purposes (C), which divided <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> into basins. In <b>the</b> northern <b>Everglades</b> were Water Conservation Areas (WCAs), and <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> Agricultural Area (EAA) bordering to <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> Lake Okeechobee. In <b>the</b> southern <b>Everglades</b> was Everglades National Park. Levees and pumping stations bordered each WCA, and released water in dryer times or removed it and pumped it to the ocean in times <b>of</b> flood. <b>The</b> WCAs took up approximately 37percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>Everglades.</b> <b>The</b> C constructed over [...] of canals, and hundreds of pumping stations and levees within three decades. During the 1950s and 1960s the Miami metropolitan area grew four {{times as fast as}} <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation. Between 1940 and 1965, 6million people moved to South Florida: 1,000people moved to Miami every week. Developed areas between the mid-1950s and the late 1960s quadrupled. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water reclaimed from <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> was sent to newly developed areas.|$|R
5|$|The {{geologic}} formations {{that have}} the most influence on <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> are <b>the</b> Miami Limestone and the Fort Thompson Formation. The Miami Limestone forms <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>Everglades.</b> <b>The</b> Miami Limestone {{is made up of}} ooids: tiny formations of egg-shaped concentric shells and calcium carbonate, formed around a single grain <b>of</b> sand. <b>The</b> Miami Limestone was formerly named the Miami Oolite, which comprises facies of ooids and fossilized bryozoan organisms. The unique structure was some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first material used in housing in early 20th-century South Florida. <b>The</b> composition <b>of</b> this sedimentary formation affects the hydrology, plant life, and wildlife above it: the rock is especially porous and stores water during the dry season in <b>the</b> <b>Everglades,</b> and its chemical composition determines the vegetation prevalent in the region. The Miami Limestone also acts as a dam between Fort Lauderdale and Coot Bay.|$|R
