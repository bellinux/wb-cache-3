5|$|In 1925, Tristan Tzara was in Stockholm, {{where he}} married Greta Knutson, {{with whom he}} had a son, Christophe (born 1927). A former student of painter André Lhote, she was known for her {{interest}} in phenomenology and abstract art. Around the same period, with funds from Knutson's inheritance, Tzara commissioned Austrian architect Adolf Loos, a former representative of the Vienna Secession whom he had met in Zürich, to build him a house in Paris. The rigidly functionalist Maison Tristan Tzara, built in Montmartre, was designed following Tzara's specific requirements and decorated with samples <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>art.</b> It was Loos' only major contribution in his Parisian years.|$|E
5|$|Shona {{sculpture}} in has survived {{through the ages}} and the modern style is a fusion of African folklore with European influences. World-renowned Zimbabwean sculptors include Nicholas, Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa, Tapfuma Gutsa, Henry Munyaradzi and Locardia Ndandarika. Internationally, Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence {{a new generation of}} artists, particularly Black Americans, through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe. Contemporary artists like New York sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans have learned to fuse both African and Afro-diasporic aesthetics in a way that travels beyond the simplistic mimicry <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Art</b> by some Black artists of past generations in the United States.|$|E

5|$|To {{ensure the}} museum's longevity, Robbins lobbied the {{national}} legislature (Congress) to absorb his museum into the Smithsonian Institution, a federal group of museums and research centers. The House of Representatives approved this plan in 1978 with backing from Representatives John Brademas, Lindy Boggs, Ron Dellums, the Congressional Black Caucus, and former Vice President Hubert Humphrey. The Smithsonian directors adopted the museum {{the next year}} and began plans to move the collection from the townhouses into a proper museum. In 1981, the museum was renamed the National Museum <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Art.</b>|$|E

5|$|Emeka Ogboh (born 1977) is a Nigerian {{sound and}} {{installation}} artist {{best known for}} his soundscapes of life in Lagos. Trained as an artist, he began working with sounds that characterize cities following an Egyptian multimedia art program. He presents unmodified field recordings from Lagos city lifefor instance, its danfo share taxi systemin gallery installations with headphones and speakers. His non-audio work uses iconography from Lagos city life. He participated in the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program and 2015 Venice Biennale, and received the 2016 Bremen Böttcherstraße Art Award. His work has exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum, American National Museum <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Art,</b> Menil Collection, Casino Luxembourg, and Kiasma. Critics noted his soundscapes' chaos and complexity, and his focus on recontextualizing rather than transforming the city's sounds.|$|E
5|$|The fair {{debuted in}} October 2013 during Frieze Week, where about 6,000 people visited the fair {{held in the}} London Somerset House. David Adjaye's company {{designed}} the fair's architectural features. By the next year, held {{at the same time}} and venue, the event had doubled in size, with 10,000 visitors and a greater variety of curators from outside African-specific specialties. Over 100 African artists exhibited in 27 galleries, including photographers J. D. 'Okhai Ojeikere, Malick Sidibé, Paul Sika, pop artist Hassan Hajjaj, sound artist Emeka Ogboh, and performance artist Athi-Patra Ruga. Mid-twentieth century photography was in particular prominence. The fair featured a series of lectures and panels, including a set curated by Koyo Kouoh of the Sengalese Raw Material Company, film screenings, and curator discussions on the future <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>art.</b> The 2014 event's primary sponsor was the Sindika Dokolo Foundation.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum was}} founded in 1964 by a Foreign Service officer and layman who bought African art objects in Germany and {{multiple}} houses in the Capitol Hill neighborhood in which to display them. The collection focused on traditional African art and an educational mission to teach black cultural heritage. To ensure the museum's longevity, the founder lobbied the national legislature to adopt the museum under the Smithsonian's auspices. It joined the Smithsonian in 1979 and became the National Museum <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Art</b> two years later. A new, mostly underground museum building was completed in 1987, just off the National Mall and adjacent to other Smithsonian museums. It is among the Smithsonian's smallest museums.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by {{his trip}} to Italy, Jarrell created the {{sculpture}} Tribute to Ovambo Bellows, a conical-shaped painted tribute to the Ovambo people, {{which would be the}} basis for a new shift in his work, towards sculpture. The new works would be categorized by their heavy spiritual nature, reflective of African culture and heritage. Hausa Space - a Village (1993) represents the villages Jarrell visited in Nigeria. The houses that he saw were decorated with icons and symbols of spiritual and ritual meaning, painted in bright colors. These decorations are used to fight evil spirits, while Jarrell's pieces speak for peace. Many of the sculptures blend elements <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> and design; Sorcerer (1993) and Messenger of Information (1993) show his earlier influences from Senufo art and other inspirations related to the design, spirituality and people of Africa. Totemlike sculptures began to be created in 1995. The three sculptures making up the Ensemble series (1995) each stand over five feet tall and are painted with brilliant colors, topped off with a small animal. For the first time, in Days of the Kings (1995), horse racing appears in Jarrell's sculptures. Sixteen totems serve as tributes to African Americans in horse racing, reminiscent of the designs of the Bijogo and Alberto Giacometti. Epiphany (1996) memorializes the Million Man March, held in Washington, D.C. the previous year, an event that Jarrell described {{as one of the most}} important of that century. This piece, and other works, were later exhibited at the 1996 Summer Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the qualities}} <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> are {{beginning}} to be more understood and appreciated. However, most African masks are now being produced for the tourist trade.

25|$|Instead of {{depicting}} {{a bowl of}} fruit or a man playing a guitar under the influence <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>art,</b> Gleizes turns toward a non-Euclidean model of geometry {{as a source of}} inspiration for Passy. This work signified the rejection of Euclidean geometry and its correlate; the quantitative measurement of spatial depth governing perspective invented during the Renaissance, an unquestioned principle of academic painting that had persisted to date.|$|E
25|$|In Groupe de femmes Csaky already {{showed a}} new way of {{representing}} nature, and the unwillingness to revert to classical, academic or traditional methods of representation. The complex syntax observed in Groupe de femmes was born out of an increasing sense of contemporary dynamism, out of the rhythm, balance, harmony and powerful geometric qualities of Egyptian art, <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>art,</b> early Cycladic art, Gothic art, and of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Auguste Rodin, Gustave Courbet, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat and Paul Cézanne.|$|E
25|$|The inspirations {{that led}} Csaky to Cubism were diverse, {{as they were}} for artists of the Bateau-Lavoir, on the one hand, or the Puteaux Group on the other. While art historians are divided on the {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> in the distillation of Cubism, they generally agree that Cézanne's geometric syntax was significant, as well as Seurat's approach to painting. Given a growing dissatisfaction with the classical methods of representation, and the contemporary changes—the industrial revolution, exposure to art from across the world—artists began to transform their expression.|$|E

25|$|Al-Zahawi’s {{early works}} took on more simplistic designs, extenuated by {{smoother}} lines, colorless texture (lacking stain), and relatively uniform spaces. This {{began to change}} when Al-Zahawi was introduced to primitive art, especially African Art through visits to the British Museum among other galleries and museums. Without a doubt African sculpture had a profound influence on his art thereafter. He would later travel and live in Africa (1965-1967) as a civil servant for the United Nations’ mission in the Congo, only serving to reinforce his love and admiration <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>art.</b>|$|E
25|$|The National Mall is {{a central}} green space in Washington, DC that {{is defined by the}} {{structures}} of the US Capitol on one end and the Jefferson Memorial on the other. Between these two points, visitors will find numerous memorials and monuments, as well as many museums belonging to the world-renowned Smithsonian Institution including the Quadrangle Museums Project, designed in 1987. It opens south from the Smithsonian Castle building and contains two small buildings which are staging areas for two underground museums, the Sackler Gallery of Asian Art, and the National Museum <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Art,</b> and another smaller kiosk–like building which provides the entrance for the S.

25|$|November Girl (1967) {{contained}} key image collages which {{formed the}} basis of many graphic and surrealist experiments in the 1970s and 1980s. African Image (1967) was a visual homage to the indigenous people, culture, landscape and wildlife of sub-Saharan Africa. The images represent a lifelong interest in photographing graphically stimulating environments and formally document his passion for indigenous craft. He broke bones on river rapids and wrote off two Volvo saloon cars on African dirt roads while shooting the book. Despite its international award, this meticulously constructed book, celebrating a love for sub-Saharan Africa, is probably the least known of his major creative projects, but it is coveted by serious collectors <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>art</b> and photography.|$|E
