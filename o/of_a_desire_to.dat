5|$|Following the massacres, many Serbs from Glina and its {{surroundings}} fled to Serbia or were deported to Ustaše-controlled concentration camps. The NDH collapsed in May 1945, {{and the following}} year the Nuremberg trials judged that the persecution experienced by Serbs in the country was a crime of genocide. Local Serbs returned to Glina after the war, partly out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> remain near the graves of their deceased family members, and lived peacefully alongside their Croat neighbours until {{the outbreak of the}} Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Higgins' song writing {{grew out}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> express her {{emotions}} {{when she was}} at school and her lyrics describe her feelings about her own life and relationships. The piano was the first instrument she learned to play, and she continues to use it as well as digital pianos including a Roland RD-300SX, RD-700 and KR-15. She also uses guitars extensively in her music particularly when touring, due to their portable nature and favours the Australian brand, Maton. On occasion she plays keytar, xylophone and melodica during performances.|$|E

After the show, the group discovered that there was already another band called Rainbow.

While the decision to change the group's name came partly out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> avoid any potential legal issues, it also reflected Klein and Eisen's desire to start playing more original compositions.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} in the gerontological literature supports the commonly held belief that older adults, overwhelmingly, prefer to remain in their own homes. Despite this fact, older adults residing in the community often express an expectation that they will move in the future. There is <b>a</b> paucity <b>of</b> empirical findings on those factors which are most influential on the expression <b>of</b> <b>an</b> expectation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> future <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> move. Logistic regression was used to analyze data from the third wave <b>of</b> <b>a</b> longitudinal study <b>of</b> elderly Massachusetts residents residing in the community to identify possible antecedents to the expression <b>of</b> <b>an</b> expectation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> future <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> move. The perception that income was not adequate to meet expenses decreased the likelihood <b>of</b> expressing <b>an</b> expectation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> future <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> move for all respondents and for those with children in the area. A living arrangement which was other than alone or with a spouse only {{was significantly related to}} the expression <b>of</b> <b>an</b> expectation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> future <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> move for all respondents and for those without children in the area. Positive self-perceived health was found to increase the likelihood that <b>an</b> expectation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> future <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> move would be expressed. <b>A</b> knowledge <b>of</b> the most important factors which contribute to the decision <b>of</b> <b>an</b> older community-dwelling adult to move from their comfortable, familiar surroundings should facilitate the implementation of programs and services which would obviate the need for some unnecessary moves and, consequently, make it possible for them to enjoy a wholesome life in the community for as long as possible...|$|R
5|$|In early May, the HV {{launched}} a successful offensive, codenamed Operation Flash, against a RSK-held part of western Slavonia in Croatia. The move caused the VRS to reorient {{its attention to}} the Orašje pocket, the only territory outside its control between the Derventa–Brčko road and the Sava River. The shift of VRS focus to Orašje {{may have been the}} result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> retaliate for the defeat suffered by the RSK in western Slavonia, or meant as a quick land-grab before a peace settlement was accepted.|$|E
5|$|As {{the complex}} was being built, and their current home at Yankee Stadium was being renovated, {{they would be}} without a home for three years. Their final full season at Yankee Stadium was 1972. After playing their first two games there in 1973, the Giants played {{the rest of their}} home games in 1973, as well as all of their home games in 1974, at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut. This was done out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> have their own home field, as opposed to having to share Shea Stadium with the Jets. However, between access problems, {{neighborhood}} issues, the fact that the Yale Bowl was not ideally suited for pro football (the stadium did not have lights, nor does it have lights today), the age of the stadium (it was built in 1914) and the lack of modern amenities, the Giants reconsidered their decision and ultimately agreed to share Shea Stadium with the Jets for the 1975 season. The Giants left Yale Bowl after losing all seven home games played at Yale in the 1974 season and compiling a home record of 1–11 over that two-year stretch.|$|E

In need of help, Emma resolves to find Ava and Nicholas's father (Nicholas Lea) out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> {{keep them out of}} the foster system she herself was raised in.

5|$|St-Calais {{managed the}} king's case against Anselm at Rockingham in 1095, when Anselm wished {{to go to}} receive his pallium from Pope Urban II. At that time St-Calais opposed Anselm's attempt to appeal to Rome over the issue, and steadfastly {{maintained}} the king's position against Anselm, even advocating that the archbishop be deprived of his lands and sent into exile. Later, when the king was negotiating with Walter of Albano, the papal legate sent by Urban to convey the pallium to Anselm and to secure the king's recognition of Urban as pope, St-Calais was the king's chief negotiator. The clerical reformers, Eadmer among them, who supported Anselm in these quarrels, later tried to claim that St-Calais had supported the king out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> succeed Anselm as archbishop if Anselm was deposed, but {{it is unlikely that}} St-Calais seriously believed that Anselm would be deposed. St-Calais secured grants from the king in return for his services. His efforts on behalf of the king earned him hostile accounts in Eadmer's later writings.|$|E
5|$|Al-Ma'mun {{had made}} no {{official}} provisions for his succession. His son, al-Abbas, was old enough and had acquired experience in the border wars with the Byzantines, but had not been named heir. According to the account in al-Tabari, on his deathbed, al-Ma'mun dictated a letter nominating his brother, rather than al-Abbas, as his successor, and Abu Ishaq was acclaimed as Caliph on 9 August, {{with the name of}} al-Mu'tasim. It is impossible to know whether this reflects actual events, or whether the letter was an invention and Abu Ishaq merely took advantage of his proximity to his dying brother, and al-Abbas's absence elsewhere, to propel himself to the throne. As Abu Ishaq was the forefather of all subsequent Abbasid caliphs, historians had little desire to question the legitimacy of his accession, {{but it is clear that}} his position was far from secure: a large part of the army favoured al-Abbas, and a delegation of soldiers even went to him and tried to proclaim him as the new Caliph. Only when al-Abbas himself refused, whether out of weakness or out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> avoid a civil war, and himself took the oath of allegiance to his uncle, did the soldiers acquiesce to al-Mu'tasim's succession. The precariousness of his position is further evidenced by the fact that al-Mu'tasim immediately called off the expedition, abandoned the Tyana project and returned with his army to Baghdad, which he reached on 20 September.|$|E

After playing their first two games there in 1973, the Giants played {{the rest of their}} home games in 1973, as well as all of their home games in 1974, at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut. This was done {{primarily}} out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> have their own home field, as opposed to having to share Shea Stadium with the Jets. Initially the NFL had a blackout policy which prevented them from playing in Connecticut, but congress passed legislation, later signed by Richard Nixon, that changed the blackout rule. However, between access problems, neighborhood issues, the fact that the Yale Bowl was not ideally suited for pro football (the stadium did not have lights, nor does it have lights today), the age of the stadium (it was built in 1914), and the lack of modern amenities, the Giants reconsidered their decision when their stadium was not completed on schedule in time for the 1975 season. Construction was delayed a year because of construction delays, cost overruns, seven lawsuits by various groups, and political haggling — New York's Governor attempted to block the team's move, and the incumbent Democratic New Jersey Governor and his republican challenger argued over the stadium. They ultimately agreed to share Shea Stadium with the Jets for the 1975 season. The Giants left Yale Bowl after losing all seven home games played at Yale in the 1974 season and compiling a home record of 1–11 over that two-year stretch.|$|E

5|$|Out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> {{have four}} trains {{regularly}} running at once each {{day on the}} DRR, in the mid-1990s the Disneyland park began to search for an additional narrow-gauge steam locomotive {{to add to the}} railroad's rolling stock. One such locomotive was acquired from Bill Norred in 1996 in exchange for the combine car and four coaches from the DRR's retired Retlaw 1 passenger train set, but after the park received it, the new locomotive was deemed to be too large for the DRR's operations. It was then sent to the Walt Disney World Railroad in the Magic Kingdom park of Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, where the locomotive was dedicated, despite being too small for the railroad's operations, and named after Disney animator and rail enthusiast Ward Kimball. Still needing a fifth locomotive for the DRR, the park traded the Ward Kimball locomotive in 1999 to the Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad in the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, for a new locomotive suitable for the railroad. Named Maud L., the locomotive was built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1902 and was originally used to haul sugar cane at the Laurel Valley Sugar Plantation in Louisiana owned by the Barker and Lepine Company. After arriving in Disneyland, the Maud L., later renamed Ward Kimball like the locomotive for which it was traded, was given a new cab built by Disney and a new boiler built by Hercules Power, which was subcontracted by Superior Boiler Works. Due to budget issues, the restoration of the locomotive was suspended not long after its arrival, and its parts were planned to be placed in long-term storage in late 2003. The Ward Kimball locomotive's restoration efforts were resurrected soon after, when it was decided that its addition to the DRR would be incorporated into the celebration of Disneyland's fiftieth anniversary in July 2005. In late 2004, Boschan Boiler and Restorations led by Paul Boschan, a former roundhouse manager and engineer at the Roaring Camp & Big Trees Narrow Gauge Railroad in Felton, California, was awarded the contract to complete the restoration of the Ward Kimball. The restoration work performed included installing new driving wheels, attaching a new smokebox door, and applying gold-leaf silhouettes of Kimball's Jiminy Cricket character {{on the sides of the}} headlamp. The Ward Kimball locomotive, which entered service on June 25, 2005, became the DRR's No. 5 locomotive, and on February 15 the following year, John Kimball, the son of Ward Kimball, who died in 2002, christened the locomotive during its dedication ceremony.|$|E
