25|$|By this time, Konnan was {{beginning}} to distrust B.G. {{to the point of}} not even recognizing him as a member of 3LK. Ron Killings, however, still trusted B.G. At Slammiversary on June 19, B.G. James promised his 3LK teammates that he would prove his loyalties. After The Truth's solo match with The Outlaw, which Killings won, The Outlaw tried to hit Truth with a steel chair. B.G. took the chair from The Outlaw, but refused to strike his former tag-team partner once more. Konnan ultimately ran The Outlaw off. Later, Konnan and B.G. James took on America's Most Wanted. They lost when Konnan was distracted by The Outlaw, causing B.G. James to not be able to tag <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> pinned after a Hart Attack. B.G. James was upset that Konnan had let The Outlaw get to him so badly, and left the Impact! Zone alone.|$|E
25|$|Will Smith {{conceived}} {{this story}} {{when he was}} watching the television show called I Shouldn't Be Alive with his brother-in-law Caleeb Pinkett. It was originally not a science fiction story but about {{a father and son}} crashing their car in the mountains or some remote region, with the son having to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> rescue for his father. Smith then decided to change the setting to 1000 years in the future, which imposed a higher budget. The film was also intended to be the first in a trilogy. Smith had his production company Overbrook contact Gary Whitta (who was then known for his script for The Book of Eli) with a simple log line for a film: a father and son crash landed on Earth 1000 years after it had been abandoned by humankind. Impressed with his idea and excited about the opportunity to work with him, Whitta fleshed out Smith's idea and pitched it to him, subsequently becoming the first employee on the project.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Mark Rucker {{directed}} a realistic production at Shakespeare Santa Cruz, starring J. Kenneth Campbell as Titus, Molly Maycock as Tamora, Elizabeth Atkeson as Lavinia, and an especially well-received performance by Bruce A. Young as Aaron. Campbell presented Titus {{in a much}} more sympathetic light than usual; for example, he kills Mutius by accident, pushing him so that he falls against a tree, and his refusal to allow Mutius to be buried was performed as if in a dream state. Prior to the production, Rucker had Young work <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> in shape so that {{by the time of the}} performance, he weighed 240lbs. Standing at six foot four, his Aaron was purposely designed to be the most physically imposing character on the stage. Additionally, he was often positioned as standing on hills and tables, with the rest of the cast below him. When he appears with the Goths, he is not their prisoner, but willingly enters their camp in pursuit of his baby, the implication being that without this one weakness, he would have been invincible.|$|E

It was a ranch house built {{into the side of}} a hill, with [...] of surrounding property. As with the rental home, the compound was turned into a de facto recording studio. They did not live together in the new house for long, though, with Coffey being the first to move <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> his own place. They all had separate residences by 1991.|$|E

Immediately they're going to say I am advising every young girl to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> pregnant. When I first heard the song, I thought it was silly. But then I thought, wait a minute, this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it's a celebration of life. It says, 'I love you, father, and I love this man and this child that is growing inside me'. Of course, who knows how it will end? But at least it starts off positive." ...|$|E
500|$|Troy Middleton was out dove {{hunting with}} his son, Troy Jr., {{and a friend}} on Sunday morning, 7 December 1941.

When they arrived at home for the mid-day meal, Mrs. Middleton greeted them with the news of the attack on Pearl Harbor. This {{put an end to the}} dove hunting, and Troy Middleton began to make plans. [...] The next day he reported to the LSU president announcing his intention to offer his services to the U.S. Army, and he sent a telegram to the War Department announcing his availability for service. Within a day or so he received a reply: [...] he would report to active duty as a lieutenant colonel on 20 January 1942, allowing him time to get his affairs in order.|$|E

500|$|Within 48 {{hours of}} taking over, Butler {{organized}} raids {{on more than}} 900 speakeasies, ordering them padlocked and, in many cases, destroyed. In addition to raiding the speakeasies, he also attempted to eliminate other illegal activities: bootlegging, prostitution, gambling, and police corruption. More zealous than he was political, he ordered crackdowns on the social elite's favorite hangouts, such as the Ritz-Carlton and the Union League, {{as well as on}} drinking establishments that served the working class. Although he was effective in reducing crime and police corruption, he was a controversial leader. In one instance he made a statement that he would promote the first officer to kill a bandit and stated, [...] "I don't believe there is a single bandit notch on a policeman's guns [...] in this city, go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> some." [...] Although many of the local citizens and police felt that the raids were just a show, the raids continued for several weeks.|$|E
500|$|The album sold well {{despite being}} {{initially}} {{pulled from the}} shelves in some stores due to concerns over some of its lyrical content. [...] The band and its record label later added a Parental Advisory sticker to the album, and some stores ordered amended copies of the album. Erna commented in Rolling Stone magazine stating, [...] "Our record {{has been in the}} marketplace {{for more than a year}} now without a parental advisory sticker and this is the one and only complaint... Stickers and lyrics are by nature subjective... We have decided to put a sticker on the record". This controversy did not appear to adversely affect album sales but, according to Erna, helped, [...] "It's almost taunting kids to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> the record to see what we're saying on it". The album also had four successful singles which were [...] "Whatever", [...] "Keep Away", [...] "Voodoo" [...] and [...] "Bad Religion".|$|E
500|$|Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{was well}} {{received}} by contemporary critics.

[...] Dennis Hunt of the Los Angeles Times cited [...] "Git Up, Git Out" [...] as the album's highlight and commended the duo's [...] "sauntering, hard-core tales of the 'hood", writing that they [...] "bristle with clever humor and sharp insights rather than rage." [...] Rob Marriott of The Source complimented the duo's [...] "organic" [...] P-Funk influence and praised their lyrics' honesty, commenting that [...] "while their rhyme style may swing {{a little too close}} to Hiero for my comfort, what really makes this album so listenable is that... truthfulness reigns." [...] However, Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "dud" [...] rating in his consumer guide for The Village Voice.|$|E

500|$|Though {{a modern}} {{synopsis}} {{has not been}} published, the original synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World on December 3, 1910. It states: [...] "Captain Smith sails away on his vessel for a trip around South America, through the Pacific, leaving behind him his wife and little girl, whom he dearly loves. The ship is reported lost with all on board, {{with the exception of}} a cabin boy who is picked up in mid ocean. The captain's wife struggles to support her child, but owing to a rapidly failing health she fights a losing battle with poverty. One by one her valued possessions find their way to the pawnshop, where the kind-hearted old pawnbroker, Levy, becomes interested in the sad-faced woman and pretty child, who never seem able to redeem any of their possessions. The last article of value left in Mrs. Smith's possession is her wedding ring, and Levy refuses to take this. Instead he offers her help, which the widow proudly refuses. She insists that she can go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> work. Levy, seeing that he can help in no other way, offers to care for little Marie, and to this the mother finally gives her consent. Half in jest, Levy gives the mother a pawn ticket for the little girl, which he fills out to read that 'a precious jewel, a value beyond price,' has been left with him and can be redeemed 'at any time.' The mother leaves the little one in Levy's care and upon reaching home and finding herself mortally stricken, she puts the pawn ticket he has given her in an envelope which she entrusts to a friendly janitoress, to be given into no other hands than those of her husband should it be that he is not dead.|$|E

[...] During the 1953 season, Lane appeared in 11 games for the Rams, but he intercepted only three passes. [...] The highlight of his 1953 season was a blocked field goal against the Green Bay Packers; Lane blocked the kick at the Rams' 25-yards line, caught it on the bounce 45 yards downfield, and returned it for a touchdown.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, {{as part of}} {{the buildup}} to The Play's 25th anniversary, the Bay Area News Group asked Verle Sorgen, the Pac-10 Conference's {{supervisor}} of instant replay, to review the two disputed laterals according to modern NCAA instant replay review rules. (Sorgen was not asked to rule on the larger issue of the Stanford band's outside interference.) After watching enhanced footage on a modern, large-screen monitor, Sorgen opined that there was insufficient video evidence to overturn the third lateral, from Garner to Rodgers. However, Sorgen believed that the fifth lateral from Ford to Moen [...] "was released at the 22 and touched at the 20-1/2 (sic). From that, it clearly appears forward." [...] Asked for his [...] "ultimate call", Sorgen replied, [...] "I would be tempted to reverse it...then go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> the motor running in my car." ...|$|E
2500|$|Producer Thom Mount (who is {{part-owner}} of {{the real}} Durham Bulls) hired Pete Bock, a former semi-pro baseball player, as a consultant on the film. [...] Bock recruited {{more than a dozen}} minor-league players, ran a tryout camp to recruit an additional 40 to 50 players from lesser ranks, hired several minor-league umpires, and conducted two-a-day workouts and practice games with Tim Robbins pitching and Kevin Costner catching. Bock made sure the actors looked and acted like ballplayers and that the real players acted convincingly in front of the cameras. He said, [...] "the director would say, 'This is the shot we want. What we need is the left fielder throwing a one-hopper to the plate. Then we need a good collision at the plate.' I would select the players I know could do the job, and then we would go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> it done".|$|E

2500|$|The demos {{finalised}} in Malibu {{caught the}} attention of Thom Panunzio, who aside from his production work (Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, Ozzy Osbourne), served as an executive for Geffen Records. The band were flattered by Panunzio's interest, immediately agreeing to the collaboration. The quintet had decided against working with Neal Avron, who had produced the band's three previous albums, as they wanted to try something different. The band's frontman, Jordan Pundik explained that, [...] "We love Neal. Neal's amazing and he's one of our really close friends. But after three records with him, after writing those records {{and a lot of other}} bands started to come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> kind of popular, we kind of wanted to try something different." [...] After hearing a demo of [...] "On My Mind", Panunzio was keen to work on the project. Pundik recalled that, [...] "one of the songs that really got him to say. 'OK, I want to do this' was that song 'On My Mind.' That song really got him. Thom's done everything from like the Go-Go's to Bob Dylan, so he's very well rounded in music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schuldiner {{continued}} {{to work on his}} music, continuing his work with Control Denied. [...] About two years after his original diagnosis, in May 2001, the cancer returned and Schuldiner fell ill again. He was at first unable to afford the surgery that he needed immediately. A press release called for support from everyone, including fellow artists. Jane Schuldiner urged all who read the statements about Schuldiner and his illness to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> insurance, stating her frustration in the American healthcare system. Schuldiner had taken out medical insurance after his first surgery, but the insurer had refused to pay because the tumor pre-dated insurance being taken out. [...] Many artists, including Kid Rock, Korn and Red Hot Chili Peppers, got together during the summer of 2001 to auction off personal items, with the funds assisting Schuldiner's medical expenses, an effort covered by MTV. Matt Heafy, vocalist and guitarist for Trivium has also stated that the band had played a benefit show for Schuldiner {{while he was in the}} hospital in their days as a local band. Schuldiner received chemotherapy with vincristine. [...] Like most drugs used in the treatment of cancer, the side effects were harsh and weakened him greatly. [...] In late October/early November, Schuldiner's condition worsened as he became ill with pneumonia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{introductory}} prose to {{the poem}} Rígsþula says that [...] "people {{say in the}} old stories" [...] that Heimdallr, described as a god among the Æsir, once fared on a journey. Heimdallr wandered along a seashore, and referred to himself as Rígr. In the poem, Rígr, who {{is described as a}} wise and powerful god, walks in the middle of roads on his way to steads, where he meets a variety of couples and dines with them, giving them advice and spending three nights at a time between them in their bed. The wives of the couples become pregnant, and from them come the various classes of humanity. Eventually a warrior home produces a promising boy, and as the boy grows older, Rígr comes out of a thicket, teaches the boy runes, gives him a name, and proclaims him to be his son. Rígr tells him to strike <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> land for himself. The boy does so, and so becomes a great war leader with many estates. He marries a beautiful woman and the two have many children and are happy. One of the children eventually becomes so skilled that he is able to share in runic knowledge with Heimdallr, and so earns the title of Rígr himself. The poem continues without further mention of the god.|$|E
