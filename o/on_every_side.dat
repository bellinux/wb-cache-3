5|$|Another steep climb of 800 feet {{brought us}} to the Marei Parei spur, {{to the spot where}} the ground was covered with the {{magnificent}} pitcher-plants, of which we had come in search. This one has been called the Nepenthes Rajah, and is a plant about four feet in length, with broad leaves stretching <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>side,</b> having the great pitchers resting on the ground in a circle about it. Their shape and size are remarkable. I will give the measurement of one, to indicate the form: the length along the back nearly fourteen inches; from the base {{to the top of the}} column in front, five inches; and its lid a foot long by fourteen inches broad, and of an oval shape. Its mouth was surrounded by a plaited pile, which near the column was two inches broad, lessening in its narrowest part to three-quarters of an inch. The plaited pile of the mouth was also undulating in broad waves. Near the stem the pitcher is four inches deep, so that the mouth is situated upon it in a triangular manner. The colour of an old chalice is a deep purple, but that of the others is generally mauve outside, very dark indeed in the lower part, though lighter towards the rim; the inside is of the same colour, but has a kind of glazed and shiny appearance. The lid is mauve in the centre, shading to green at the edges. The stems of the female flowers we found always a foot shorter than those of the male, and the former were far less numerous than the latter. It is indeed one of the most astonishing productions of nature.|$|E

All four borders are pre-folded at the factory. Folded edges <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>side</b> allow large {{sheet metal parts}} to lie even with the cladding surface.

25|$|The near {{neighbourhood}} of Basing House {{involved the}} town of Basingstoke to some extent in the protracted military operations of which the former was for two years the centre. The condition of Basingstoke Church, the walls of which are indented with shot <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>side,</b> but especially on the south, makes it almost certain that (as {{is known to have}} been the case at Alton and at Basing itself) the sacred building afforded a refuge to the troops of one or other army, while their enemies assaulted it. A Parliamentary committee had its sittings in the town in July, 1644, but fled on the approach of Gage with his relief.|$|E
25|$|Cristobal de Ovalle, {{seeing that}} he would be cut off from the town, took up a new {{position}} covering the town gates, whilst his cavalry threatened the English flank and rear under cover of a herd of cattle. Carleill however placed his pikemen and musketeers <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>side,</b> so that the Spanish were driven back and the cattle simply ran into the jungle. With both columns still advancing they received the fire of the Spanish guns at very close quarters. An ambuscade of Spanish musketeers beside the road had no better success as these were quickly driven back by English fire. Within half an hour, the landing party had reached the western walls of Santo Domingo, and the majority of the Spanish troops and militia were in flight.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1521, the Earl of Surrey was {{recalled}} from Ireland to take {{command of}} the English fleet in naval operations against France. His ships were ill-provisioned, and his warfare consisted {{of a series of}} raids upon the French coast for the purpose of inflicting all the damage possible. When Surrey abandoned the siege of Brest, he left Vice-Admiral William FitzWilliam on station to blockade the port. The English navy patrolled the coast of Brittany for the next three months, but was unable to score a decisive victory with their Spanish allies. In July 1522, Surrey had burned Morlaix, in September, he had laid waste the country around Boulogne, spreading devastation <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>side</b> until the winter brought back the fleet to England. The sea patrol was abandoned with little achieved.|$|E

25|$|We {{are entirely}} in accord in admitting the {{existence}} of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, my faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>side,</b> in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{study the}} anatomy of veins of the lower lumbar spine and provide the {{anatomic}} basement for laparoscopic lumbar surgery. MethodsA total of 15 formaldehyde-preserved cadavers were studied with {{special attention to the}} variety and surrounding structure of ascending lumbar vein (ALV) and iliolumbar veins (ILV), and their relationship with lumbar plexus. ResultsALV and ILV can be found <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>sides,</b> which have four variants including separate entry and common entry. The ascending vein and iliolumbar vein separately enter common iliac vein in 18 cases, and as a common stem enter the common iliac vein in 12 cases. Retracting common iliac vein medially both the ascending lumbar and the iliolumbar veins are always at risk of avulsion on exposure of the disc space. The injury of obturator nerve and lumbosacral trunk of lumbar plexus should be avoided. ConclusionsAwareness of these anatomic variation can prevent the hemorrhage and be helpful for the surgeon in performing a careful ligation of these veins before medial retraction of the common iliac vein. Our findings emphasize the need for proper dissection of ALV and ILV before ligature during exposure of the lower lumbar spine...|$|R

Thomas Pettit, the Populist candidate from the 1895 gubernatorial election, campaigned for Goebel, {{but many of the}} other leaders in the party did not. With his support slipping <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>side,</b> Goebel appealed to William Jennings Bryan to come to the state and campaign for him. Known as [...] "the Great Commoner", Bryan was immensely popular with Kentuckians, particularly Democrats and Populists. After refusing initial requests, Bryan finally came to the state and, in three days, crisscrossed the state with Goebel to stir up support. Bryan's visit helped solidify Democrats behind Goebel and took significant support from the Brown ticket.|$|E
