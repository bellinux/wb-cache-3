5|$|Since the mid-1990s, BART {{has been}} trying to {{modernize}} its system. The fleet rehabilitation is part of this modernization; in 2009, fire alarms, fire sprinklers, yellow tactile platform edge domes, and cemented-mat rubber tiles were installed. The rough black tiles on the platform edge mark the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> of approaching trains, allowing passengers to wait at the right place to board. All faregates and ticket vending machines were replaced.|$|E
25|$|The porch {{dates from}} the 16th century, pre-reformation, and is built in brick. The roof timber was old timber reused. There is a pre-Reformation niche over the door and a holy water stoup {{on the east side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E

The works of decorative art are florid in style.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} kinds of doors, with {{different}} purposes. The most common type is the single-leaf door, which consists of a single rigid panel that fills the doorway. There are many variations on this basic design, such as the double-leaf door or double door and French windows, which have two adjacent independent panels hinged on each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rock faced stone columns {{on either}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> and {{storefront}} continue for the first story only and then are extended by brick pilasters to the full height of the building. The brick pilasters above the doorway continue above the fourth story to form a small tower. The tower is flat-roofed now but was originally capped by a shallow-pitched roof.|$|E

25|$|<b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways,</b> <b>the</b> {{one to the}} south—which {{leads into}} the Lords Chamber—is the most magnificent, and sports much gilding and decoration, {{including}} the full royal arms. It is enclosed by the Brass Gates, a pair of elaborately pierced and studded doors together weighing 1.5 tonnes. The side doors, which feature clocks, open into corridors: to the east extends the Law Lords Corridor, {{which leads to the}} libraries, and nearby to the west lies the Moses Room, used for Grand Committees.|$|R
50|$|A dogleg timber {{staircase}} {{with half}} landing {{is located at}} <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Green House. A prominent feature of this staircase is the large arched window, with decorative coloured glass, located in the western elevation. The window has three rectangular sections at its base and three sections forming <b>the</b> arch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window. The window frame and keystone are timber. The stairs lead to a hallway, from which open a series <b>of</b> offices. <b>The</b> office <b>doorways</b> are surmounted by glass fanlights, and one office has a pressed metal ceiling. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways</b> is surmounted with a timber arch with exaggerated keystone and glass fanlight. Fireplaces exist in two rooms, and align with those found on the ground floor. Another staircase, of recent construction, is located in <b>the</b> northern elevation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building.|$|R
25|$|On {{the south}} wall, {{next to the}} transept, is a still-impressive processional entrance. The door pillars are surmounted by a {{segmental}} arch, and above that a round arch of three orders, the area between forming a tympanum. The entire exterior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> is carved in a detailed zig-zag pattern, which was probably used widely around the building. Beyond this lay the cloister, from which the canons would enter the church in procession.|$|E
25|$|The porch has {{a pointed}} arch opening, with rosettes to reveals, and a {{decorative}} ogee arch surround with blind niches. On the east wall {{there is a}} carved stone Holy water stoup. On the west wall there is a Norman capital of a colonnette above which is a carved stone panel depicting the Agnus Dei {{thought to be the}} centre of a tympanum.Two Norman colonnettes, with Romanesque capitals are incorporated into the wall on each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> The doorway has a Norman style arch with zig-zag decoration that was added in 1883.|$|E
25|$|Close to this maze is a {{recreation}} of the Tea Party of the March Hare and the Hatter. Known as March Hare Refreshments, guests can have drinks near the Hare's house. Like in Walt Disney World and in Tokyo Disneyland, the Dormouse {{can be seen}} popping {{his head out of}} a large teapot and the March Hare, although absent, can be seen on the sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> The attraction Mad Hatter's Tea Cups is located close to this house as well. Back in April 1992 when the park opened, March Hare Refreshments sold Unbirthday Cakes (Gâteau de non-anniversaire) for 19,00 FF each.|$|E

25|$|The jamb <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> at Monkwearmouth, {{carved with}} a pair of lacertine beasts, {{probably}} dates from the 680s; the golden, garnet-adorned pectoral cross of St Cuthbert was presumably made before 687; while his wooden inner coffin (incised with Christ and the Evangelists' symbols, the Virgin and Child, archangels and apostles), the Lindisfarne Gospels, and the Codex Amiatinus all date from c.700. The fact that these works are all from Northumbria might be held to reflect the particular strength of the church in that kingdom {{during the second half of}} the century. Works from the south were more restrained in their ornamentation than are those from Northumbria.|$|E
25|$|The portico {{is marked}} by two sculpted pilasters, {{comprising}} a large arch, surmounted by a slim canopy, containing two minor arches of the same profile. Rising from a simple base, but multifaceted barrel, the pilasters are tri-faceted, with by middle-relief decoration and statuary. In the internal faces, include six kneeling cherubs facing the doorways. Meanwhile, in the exterior facetes there are various decorative elements, that include urns, fantastical animals, heads of angels, badges, cornucopias, medallions and other stylized vegetal elements, dominated by two niches on either side. These two niches, with corbels and canopies, contain figures of the Angel Gabriel (on the right) and the Virgin Mary (on the left), with the pilasters above the niches, semi-circular and striated, extending into pinnacles, surmounted by armillary spheres. These pilasters are united above the main portico, by a line of vegetal decoration that frames the periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
25|$|Visitors {{are confronted}} by the still-impressive west front, with a wide central doorway, surmounted by a round arch. This western end was {{finished}} comparatively late, in the 13th century, and the round arch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> is meant to complement the earlier work visible through the portal. The massive stonework on either side originally carried {{the weight of a}} great western tower, probably destroyed in the siege, along with the west window. The northern base has suffered least and still has arcading {{at the level of the}} vanished window sill, decorated in a trefoil pattern. The pointed gothic arches of its windows contrast sharply with the late romanesque gateway. Moving through the gateway, it is possible to climb a narrow staircase on the north wall of the nave to the level of the arcade, thus obtaining a good view of the remains of the church and of the landscape beyond. There is a small, well-preserved lavabo on the southern wall of the nave.|$|E
50|$|A {{house in}} the {{circular}} main street of Montefioralle is pointed out as <b>the</b> birthplace <b>of</b> Amerigo Vespucci. <b>The</b> <b>doorway</b> is identified by the wasp ("vespa") and V <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vespucci family.|$|R

50|$|Beginning in 1931, the DGEMN Direcção-Geral de Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais (General Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments) started various {{restoration}} {{works on}} the church. This included <b>the</b> demolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern chapel (where the sacristy functioned) and <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> a larger annex; <b>the</b> demolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old sacristy; opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lateral northern <b>doorway</b> (which was blocked); dismantling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choir, frontispiece, nave altars and substitution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> altar; the consolidation and repositioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> architrave <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main chapel; removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulpit, existing tiles and reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same; cleaning and repairs to the stonework (interior and exterior); consolidation and restoration of Rosetta window; reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> granite slab pavement and leveling; regularization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> churchyard; construction and replacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways</b> and <b>the</b> placement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> windows. In <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> these repairs, in 1936, a study was made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frescoes within the church, and two years later, the cemetery was moved.|$|R
25|$|A French door {{consists}} of a frame around one or more transparent or translucent panels (called lights or lites) that may be installed singly, in matching pairs, or even as series. A matching pair of these doors is called a French window, as it resembles a door-height casement window. When a pair of French doors {{is used as a}} French window, the application does not generally include a central mullion (as do some casement window pairs), thus allowing a wider unobstructed opening. The frame typically requires a weather strip at floor level and where the doors meet to prevent water ingress. An espagnolette bolt may allow the head and foot of each door to be secured in one movement. The slender window joinery maximizes light into the room and minimizes the visual impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> joinery when considered externally. The doors of a French window often open outward onto a balcony, porch, or terrace and they may provide an entrance to a garden.|$|E
25|$|The {{third stage}} {{comprises}} the porch, including the west gable parapet wall surmounted by a Latin cross at its apex, the gable parapet {{wall to the}} nave also with a Latin cross, and the tiled roofs of the nave, apse and porch. The porch is {{to the west of}} the nave, its walls also constructed of random rubble with uncoloured concrete block quoins. The western porch facade has a rectangular window with three lights, the outer casements of which open outwards while the central light is fixed. There is a narrow, upright slit in the stone wall above the window. The western facade of the nave has a circular window in-filled with fixed louvers and topped by a stone drip moulding. Both gable parapets have moulded block-work coping. The northern elevation of the porch features a doorway now accessed by a ramp with a bell mounted to the right-hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> that is framed in bevelled concrete.|$|E
25|$|The last slab of {{the east}} side, BM 529 (Fig. 12, Pl. 45), restores a sense of ordered warfare, and the {{fortunes}} of the Greeks improve. One each of the armed (BM 529:2) and unarmed Greeks (529:4) is victorious over a centaur. The north portion of the frieze (Fig. 13), like that of the south that faces it, depicts {{the most important part of}} the action and is segregated from the rest of its subject by its compositional unity. The compositional patterns on both the north and south conform to the architectural forms below the frieze. On the three slabs at the south, groups balance one another in axial symmetry around the prominent central figure of Herakles, who stands above the Corinthian column. The four slabs on the north divide into two pain; the movement of the figures is largely centrifugal, so that the formal and narrative void at the center of the frieze echoes the architectural void <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> below. This centrifugal design brings to a halt the right-to-left movement of the spectator around the cella at the point where the frieze ends and he leaves the temple.|$|E
50|$|Below again, is a {{semi-circular}} gallery with statues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin and Child seated, in gilt beaten copper. On {{either side}} are two large blue panels showing the time: the {{hour on the}} left in Roman numerals and the minutes (at 5 minute intervals) on the right in Arabic numerals. Twice a year, at Epiphany (6 January) and on Ascension Day (the Thursday 40 days after Easter, counting both days) the three Magi, led by an angel with a trumpet, emerge from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways</b> normally taken up by these numbers and pass in procession round the gallery, bowing to the Virgin and child, before disappearing through the other door.|$|R
25|$|The {{tympanum}} has two registers. On {{the first}} {{there are two}} inverted semi-circles with decorations (urns, cornocopias and animal figures). Tangent to <b>the</b> arches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways</b> are medallions with classical bust, while on the periphery there are relief imagery. The second register, semi-circular, holds a sculptured group of figures that represents the classical Misericórdia symbol, or Mater Omnium, over a freize with elevated platform consisting of semi-circular dietes. On this platform is the Virgin Mary, secured by two angels, over figures representing Pope Alexander VI, Father Miguel Contreiras, a bishop and cardinal (all on the right), and Queen Eleonor, King Manuel and two prelated (on the left).|$|R
2500|$|The Monreale cathedral is {{generally}} described as [...] "Norman-Arab-Byzantine". <b>The</b> outsides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principal <b>doorways</b> and their pointed arches are magnificently enriched with carving and colored inlay, a curious combination of three styles— Norman-French, Byzantine and Arab.|$|R
25|$|The plan of {{the church}} {{consists}} of a four-bay nave, with north and south aisles, and north and south porches, a crossing with north and south transepts, a two-bay chancel with a vestry to the north, the Trinity Chapel to the south, and a west tower. The tower has four stages, the bottom three stages are in red sandstone, and the top stage in white sandstone. The bottom three stages are Norman in style, while the top stage is Perpendicular. In the bottom stage is a west doorway with a round arch of two orders. To the left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> is a re-used Roman stone with a Lewis slot. In the next stage, over the doorway, is a clock face. The third stage contains paired Norman windows, and in the top stage are paired two-light transomed bell openings. The summit of the tower has an embattled pierced parapet, and crocketted pinnacles. There is a stair turret in the northeast corner. The spire is octagonal, and recessed behind the parapet. It carries three tiers of lucarnes. The spire {{is said to be}} the third tallest in England.|$|E
25|$|The portal is {{a simple}} arch with subtle reliefs with small angels, cherubs and {{vegetative}} motifs on the archivolt as well as portraits of saints and friars. One of these portraits may be Jorge de Avile y Ro, {{the founder of the}} monastery. On the left side there is a portrait of a lay person with a Roman style haircut, who was probably the architect. The wooden doorjambs are decorated with the heads of angels and rose patterns as well as vegetative motifs. The bars on the main doors were added in 1910 by Father Evaristo Nava, who also donated the clock that can be seen on the complex’s back tower. Around the arch and the doors, the portal is sculpted in both a detailed and subtle way. To the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> there are two pairs of pilasters. These are in Renaissance style {{while the rest of the}} portal mixes Gothic and Plateresque. However, the columns also have channels which are more often associated with the later Churrigueresque. At the base of the columns there are busts of Saint Ambrose, bishop of Milan and Cicero, who was an influence on the philosophy of Saint Augustine. The pilasters are topped with capitals, which support a frieze that contains reliefs of small angels flying with a cross in the center. Above the frieze, there is a panel with a niche, today empty, flanked by the coats of arms of the Augustinians and the Franciscans. Underneath the coats of arms, there is an angel riding a dragon. Topping this is a pediment.|$|E
500|$|At 3am a blood-stained {{fragment}} of Eddowes' apron was found {{lying in the}} passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> leading to 108 to 119 Goulston Street, Whitechapel, {{about a third of}} a mile (500m) from the murder scene. There was chalk writing on the wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> which read either [...] "The Juwes are the men that will not be blamed for nothing" [...] or [...] "The Juwes are not the men who will be blamed for nothing." [...] At 5am, Commissioner Warren attended the scene and ordered the words erased for fear that they would spark anti-Semitic riots. Goulston Street was on a direct route from Mitre Square to Flower and Dean Street, where both Stride and Eddowes lived.|$|E
2500|$|The tower {{has three}} stages. It is built in rubble with granite {{for the long}} and short quoins, the string course, embattled parapet, and the tall corner pinnacles with crocketted finials. <b>The</b> <b>doorway</b> to <b>the</b> porch {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer order <b>of</b> a Norman doorway which has been moved from elsewhere. It includes zigzag carving and flowers carved in heavy relief. <b>The</b> <b>doorway</b> to <b>the</b> church itself consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner two orders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norman <b>doorway</b> with zigzag carving on both orders. [...] On the capitals are carved birds and pine cones.|$|R
25|$|There is {{a second}} {{entrance}} with modest dimensions in the east wall. On <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> is positioned above some projecting stonework {{that may have been}} intended as the bonding to a curtain wall that was never built. The entrance was perhaps originally served by a wooden staircase but when the gatehouse was constructed it gave direct access to the châtelain's residence. <b>The</b> <b>doorway</b> and four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> niches were blocked at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th century when the two upper floors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower was used as a prison. They were unblocked as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restoration work carried out in the 1970s.|$|R
