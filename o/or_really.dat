25|$|The musical, Closer to Heaven, {{opened at}} the Arts Theatre in London, in 2001, with {{financial}} backing from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group. Reviews were mixed and although the run was initially extended, it closed earlier than expected, due to poor ticket sales, in October 2001. Around {{the time of the}} London closure, Tennant said that they were in talks to take the musical to various locations in Europe (particularly Germany, which is a big market for Pet Shop Boys) and to take it to New York. Nothing further was issued by the Pet Shop Boys <b>or</b> <b>Really</b> Useful Group regarding these performances; in 2005, a series of performances were staged in the Brisbane Powerhouse, Australia, though they were arranged independently of Pet Shop Boys and the Really Useful Group.|$|E

25|$|Many boxing {{analysts and}} experts said that Darren Barker has {{the skills and}} ring generalship to one day become a champion, but that his skills were not perfected enough to do {{anything}} against Martínez. The first few rounds showed that Barker was actually able to make Martínez uncomfortable in the ring and give him more trouble than expected. Throughout the fight, Barker consistently gave Martínez problems, while never hurting him <b>or</b> <b>really</b> ever winning any of the rounds, he gave Martínez a challenge by coming in but not giving much offence to let Martínez counter or land anything clean. He also managed to get Martínez's nose to bleed early in the rounds by an upper-cut.

500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{said that}} while the video surpassed her most iconic clips in terms of sheer spectacle, it still {{displayed}} a level on restraint in its themes. He summarized the review by saying it was one of her all-time best videos, adding that [...] "there's genuine art to it, which makes it both beautiful to look at and powerful." [...] Montgomery also found that the video was inspired by the Graeae, iamamiwhoami, Kanye West's short film Runaway, the music videos for Robyn's [...] "Indestructible", Madonna's [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] and [...] "Die Another Day", The Matrix franchise, Mortal Kombat, The Rocky Horror Picture Show and the Cam de Leon painting Ocular Orifice, which served as one of several covers of the Tool album Ænima. Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone called it [...] "a total visual assault", and added that it [...] "is a mix of everything we've come to expect from Britney", such as sexy costumes and elaborate choreography. Aaron Parsley of People believed that the fight sequence was the highlight of the video, but dismissed the product placement. Bill Lamb of About.com said the video was visually stellar, although he added that it was [...] "difficult to know" [...] if it would [...] "match the impact of" [...] clips such as [...] "Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "Toxic". Willa Paskin of New York deemed it as [...] "a high-energy, professional, dance video", but stated that [...] " [...] make up for the basic fact that she isn’t in the dancing shape, <b>or</b> <b>really,</b> performing shape she once was." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reviewers {{considered}} the play notable as Hanks' debut and Ephron's posthumous finale, and reactions were generally warm to mixed. A glowing review was delivered by Ben Brantley of The New York Times: [...] "Lucky Guy {{is both an}} elegy and a valentine to a vanishing world held dear in the collective imagination of New Yorkers, that of the rough-and-tumble of big-city newsrooms and scoop-hungry reporters." [...] Brantley {{also noted that the}} play was scripted [...] "with a true fan’s glee and avidity". New York Observer critic Rex Reed also enthused: [...] "It’s a play that grabs you by the throat, makes you laugh and cry, holds you transfixed for two hours, paralyzes you from start to finish, and leaves you cheering." [...] New York Magazine critic Jesse Green similarly commented: [...] "With an insider's devastating combination of repulsion and affection, Nora Ephron has written a most unlikely thing: a play about journalism, <b>or</b> <b>really</b> about telling stories, that is as rich and rough and elegiac and fun as the lost world it re-creates." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon Sam Tyler awaking in 1973, {{he finds}} himself on a {{building}} site, beneath a large advertising board, proclaiming {{the construction of a}} new motorway, the Mancunian Way. In reality, construction of Mancunian Way was completed in 1967. According to Matthew Graham, writing in the Radio Times, the error was deliberate. [...] "We knew that this road was built in the 1960s, but we took a bit of artistic licence". Minor historical anachronisms such as this are present throughout Life on Mars. Some, as above, were made out of artistic licence whilst others were deliberately inserted to confuse the issue of whether Sam Tyler was in a coma, mad <b>or</b> <b>really</b> back in time. Many inaccuracies were visible such as modern street furniture, cable television cabinets, satellite television dishes, CCTV cameras, LCD digital watches and double-glazed uPVC window frames, which were all unintentional. During DVD commentaries for the series, the programme makers acknowledge these as errors but also point out they are in fact perfectly feasible, given Sam's situation. As the popularity of the series grew, the hunting of such anachronisms became a favourite pastime among Life on Mars fans.|$|E
2500|$|As for {{the armed}} forces of the North Vietnamese and National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF), American readers rarely {{encountered}} the argument that the communists were waging a war of reunification rather than [...] "a campaign to further the interests of a communist conspiracy masterminded by the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union." [...] The domino theory was utilized to justify the American intervention in order to prevent regional domination by China, overlooking centuries of hostility between the Vietnamese and the Chinese. Throughout the war communist troops were continuously portrayed as [...] "brutal, cruel, fanatic, sinister, untrustworthy, and warlike". Most depictions of [...] employed hateful imagery or reinforced racial stereotypes of the era associated with Asians." [...] Asian stereotypes extended to the American soldiers' view of their South Vietnamese allies too; most effectively never met a South Vietnamese soldier <b>or</b> <b>really</b> knew the farmer and peasant in the field. The media {{went so far as to}} follow the lead of the American military by refusing to refer to communist forces by their correct titles. NLF forces were referred to by the term Viet Cong (despite its wide usage, [...] "Viet Cong", which means [...] "Vietnamese Communist", is considered pejorative [...] ) and northern troops of the People's Army of Vietnam as the North Vietnamese Army, or NVA.|$|E
2500|$|The Twelfth Doctor is, {{according}} to Capaldi, [...] "more alien than he's {{been in a}} while." [...] Whilst still defining himself as someone who [...] "saves people," [...] the Twelfth Doctor cares little about being seen as a hero or even being liked {{by the people who}} he is trying to save. Unlike his previous two incarnations who cared about humans and tried to understand them, Capaldi has confirmed that, this incarnation [...] "doesn't quite understand human beings <b>or</b> <b>really</b> care very much about their approval." [...] Clara is put on the back-foot by him post-regeneration initially not seeing through his 'Tough Exterior'. Playing Clara, Jenna Coleman says of this Doctor, [...] "He's more removed, you can't quite access him in the same way", in comparison to his more friendly and accessible predecessor. Initially it was reported that Capaldi specifically requested that the Doctor will not flirt with his companion the way his previous incarnation did, but the actor stated that he said no such thing and that it was inflated by the media. Steven Moffat has teased that Capaldi's Doctor may perhaps be more in love with Clara than he'd like to believe. He has also been described as a [...] "total adrenaline junkie" [...] and, {{according to}} Moffat, [...] "much fiercer, madder [...] less reliable". [...] "He's not as immediately approachable and he's not necessarily looking for your approval, when he says 'Wait here, I'll be back', you're not absolutely convinced... what he's not doing is reassuring you very much." ...|$|E

2500|$|IGN {{reviewed}} {{all four}} {{versions of the}} game. David Smith scored the PlayStation 2 version 9.4 out of 10, giving it an [...] "Editor's Award" [...] and calling the Dark Alliance engine [...] "one of the best 3D engines yet devised." [...] He dismissed criticisms of the game as a [...] "Diablo clone," [...] arguing the gameplay is much deeper than such a comparison suggests. His only criticisms were some anti-climatic boss fights and repetitive music. He concluded [...] "There is honestly {{not a great deal}} to complain about here [...] Snowblind has put together one of the best engines on PS2 {{and one of the best}} hacks in the business, certainly the best a console has ever seen." [...] Kaiser Hwang scored the Xbox version 8.5 out of 10. He praised the graphics, but wrote [...] "What hurts this game's score is the fact that it is almost exactly the same game that was released last year, not that that's a bad thing. The game is a fine example of exceptional game-making. But an extra level or character, <b>or</b> <b>really</b> any added extras would've been great." [...] Fran Mirabella III scored the GameCube version 7.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "a downgrade from the PS2 version." [...] He criticized the [...] "bafflingly destroyed frame rate," [...] and commented [...] "When it was released on the PS2 a year ago, few could believe what Snowblind had pulled off on Sony's stubborn console. A year later, and quite magically, High Voltage couldn't get the engine running smoothly on GameCube." [...] Craig Harris scored the Game Boy Advance version 8 out of 10, arguing that [...] "Even though it's missing a few key elements from the original design it's based upon, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance works out very well in portable form." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is more {{controversial}} whether [...] "constructive trusts" [...] {{in the family}} home respond to consent or intention, <b>or</b> <b>really</b> respond to contributions to property, which are usually found in the [...] "miscellaneous" [...] category of events that generate obligations. In a sixth situation, constructive trusts have been acknowledged to arise since the late 1960s, where two people are living together in a family home, but are not married, and both are making financial or other contributions to the house, but only one is registered on the legal title. The law had settled in Lloyds Bank plc v Rosset as requiring saying that (1) if an agreement had been made for both {{to share in the}} property, then a constructive trust would be imposed in favour of the person who was not registered, or (2) they had nevertheless made direct contributions to the purchase of the home or mortgage repayments, then they would have a share of the property under a constructive trust. However, in Stack v Dowden, and then Jones v Kernott the Law Lords held by a majority that Rosset probably no longer represented the law (if it ever did) and that a [...] "common intention" [...] to share in the property could be inferred from a wide array of circumstances (including potentially simply having children together), and also perhaps [...] "imputed" [...] without any evidence. However, if a constructive trust, and a property right binding third parties, arises in this situation based on imputed intentions, or simply on the basis that it was fair, it would mean that constructive trusts did not merely respond to consent, but also to the fact of valuable contributions being made. There remains significant debate both about the proper manner of characterising constructive trusts in this field, and also about how far the case law should match the statutory regime that applies for married couples under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.|$|E
