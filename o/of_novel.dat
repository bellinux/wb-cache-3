5|$|Biomedical {{researchers}} {{have examined the}} applications of rhodium compounds and their derivatives in medicine and reported one potential application for a rhodocene derivative as a radiopharmaceutical to treat small cancers. Rhodocene derivatives are used to synthesise linked metallocenes so that metal–metal interactions can be studied; potential applications of these derivatives include molecular electronics and research into the mechanisms of catalysis. The value of rhodocenes tends {{to be in the}} insights they provide into the bonding and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> chemical systems, rather than their applications.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{abilities}} {{that have been}} investigated include concept formation, sensory skills, and mental representations. Such research has been ongoing since the 1970s. This includes: Acoustic and behavioral mimicry, Comprehension <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> sequences in an artificial language, Memory, Monitoring of self behavior, Discrimination and matching, Comprehension of symbols for various body parts, Comprehension of pointing gestures and gaze (as made by dolphins or humans), Mirror self-recognition, and Numerical values.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{detailed}} {{design for the}} Merchant Navy class was undertaken by the drawing office at Brighton works, but some work was also undertaken by Ashford and Eastleigh. This division of responsibility was possibly due to Bulleid's wish to restrict knowledge of the new class to {{a limited number of}} personnel. The design incorporated a number <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> features, compared to then-current steam locomotive practice in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|New {{drugs are}} the {{products}} of a long drug development process, {{the first step of}} which is often the discovery of a new enzyme inhibitor. In the past the only way to discover these new inhibitors was by trial and error: screening huge libraries of compounds against a target enzyme and hoping that some useful leads would emerge. This brute force approach is still successful and has even been extended by combinatorial chemistry approaches that quickly produce large numbers <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> compounds and high-throughput screening technology to rapidly screen these huge chemical libraries for useful inhibitors.|$|E

Vikarmas are people who bear misfortunes in this life due to sins of their past births. She is a skilled swords-woman and is very brave since childhood. During the course <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> she marries Shiva and bears his child.|$|E

5|$|The {{last three}} decades have seen a {{proliferation}} of subfamily names, {{as a result of}} three factors: (1) the realization that some subfamilies were assemblages of unrelated taxa; (2) abandonment of paraphyletic taxa, and (3) the discovery <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> fossil taxa. Seventeen extant subfamilies of ants are currently recognized, along with four extinct subfamilies. One of the fossil taxa, Armaniinae, is often given family rank within the superfamily Formicoidea. About 13 genera are incertae sedis (of uncertain placement), and are not assigned to any subfamily.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the endomembrane system {{is linked to the}} origin of eukaryotes {{themselves}} and the origin of eukaryoties to the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria. Many models have been put forward to explain the {{origin of the}} endomembrane system (reviewed in). The most recent concept suggests that the endomembrane system evolved from outer membrane vesicles the endosymbiotic mitochondrion secreted. This OMV-based model for the origin of the endomembrane system is currently the one that requires the least amount <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> inventions at eukaryote origin and explains the many connections of mitochondria with other compartments of the cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{proteasome}} and its subunits are {{of clinical}} significance {{for at least}} two reasons: (1) a compromised complex assembly or a dysfunctional proteasome can be associated with the underlying pathophysiology of specific diseases, and (2) they can be exploited as drug targets for therapeutic interventions. More recently, more effort has been made to consider the proteasome for the development <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> diagnostic markers and strategies. An improved and comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of the proteasome should lead to clinical applications in the future.|$|E
