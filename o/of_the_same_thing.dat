25|$|Bergson {{responds}} {{by saying}} that the antinomies are the result of analysis, not intuition. An example of this is Duration itself, which Bergson maintains isn’t a multiplicity or a unity. Depending on the viewpoint from which one begins, he will either reconstruct the absolute Duration as a unity or a multiplicity. Hence the antinomy of substance pluralism and substance monism, which can only be resolved through showing they are two representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> via a simple act of intuition. Thus real philosophy consists in placing oneself above the fray of oppositional schools of thought.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} half of the seventeenth century, René Descartes (1596–1650) began to develop a more modern, materialistic concept of the conatus, {{describing}} it as [...] "an active power or tendency of bodies to move, expressing the power of God". Whereas the ancients used the term in a strictly anthropomorphic sense similar to voluntary [...] "endeavoring" [...] or [...] "struggling" [...] to achieve certain ends, and medieval Scholastic philosophers developed a notion of conatus as a mysterious intrinsic property of things, Descartes uses the term in a somewhat more mechanistic sense. More specifically, for Descartes, in contrast to Buridan, movement and stasis are two states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing,</b> not different things. Although there is much ambiguity in Descartes' notion of conatus, one can see here the beginnings of a move away from the attribution of desires and intentions to nature and its workings toward a more scientific and modern view.|$|E
