For the determination of the lateral loads, it is required to estimate first the fundamental vibration period of the building theoretically or experimentally [1 – 4]. In various current codes such as the current United States (US) and Egyptian building codes and also in the recommendations of many researches, empirical formulas relate the building fundamental period of vibration (T) to the building <b>overall</b> <b>height</b> (<b>H)</b> or the number of stories (N) without consideration of the two factors together. In this paper, improved formulas for estimating the fundamental period of vibration (T) of reinforced concrete moment-resisting frame buildings are developed by taking the effect of both building height (H) and number of stories together (N) (i. e. take the floor height (h) into consideration). The improved formula is based on regression analysis of the available data for the fundamental vibration period of reinforced concrete moment-resisting frame buildings measured from their motions recorded during eight California earthquakes. The results indicated that the value of coefficient Ct in the current US and Egyptian building codes’ formulas should be modified to be a function of the number of stories (N). Comparisons between the periods determined using the proposed formula and the measured values show good agreement...|$|E

For the determination of the lateral loads, it is required to estimate first the fundamental vibration period of the building theoretically or experimentally (Uniform Building Code (UBC- 1997); Structural Engineers Association of California (SEAOC- 1996); Egyptian Code for Computation of Loads and Forces in Structural and Building Work (EGC- 2012); Applied Technological Council, 1978). In various codes such as the current United States (US) and Egyptian building codes and also in the recommendations of many researches, empirical period formulas for concrete shear wall buildings relate the building fundamental period of vibration (T) to the building <b>overall</b> <b>height</b> (<b>H).</b> In this paper, using the available data for the fundamental vibration period of reinforced concrete shear wall buildings measured from their motions recorded during eight California earthquakes, improved formulas for estimating the fundamental period of vibration (T) of concrete shear wall buildings are developed by regression analysis of the measured period data. The results indicate that the value of coefficient Ct in the current US and Egyptian building codes formula should be decreased from its present value 0. 02 to 0. 014. Also, factors to limit the period calculated by rational analysis, such as Rayleigh’s method, are recommended in this paper.
