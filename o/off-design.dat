5000|$|So {{far we have}} {{examined}} steady state performance modelling. A crude transient performance model can be developed by relatively minor adjustments to the <b>off-design</b> calculation.

50|$|Compressor {{maps are}} an {{integral}} part of predicting the performance of a gas turbine engine, both at design and <b>off-design</b> conditions. Fans and turbines also have operating maps, although the latter are significantly different in appearance to that of compressors.|$|E

50|$|Although each <b>off-design</b> {{point is}} {{effectively}} a design point calculation, the resulting cycle (normally) {{has the same}} turbine and nozzle geometry as that at the engine design point. Obviously the final nozzle cannot be over or underfilled with flow. This rule also applies to the turbine nozzle guide vanes, which act like small nozzles.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{types of}} {{secondary}} flows occur in turbomachinery, including inlet prerotation (intakes vorticity), tip clearance flow (tip leakage), flows at <b>off-design</b> performance (e.g. flow separation), and secondary vorticity flows. [...] Although secondary flows occur in all turbomachinery, {{it is particularly}} considered in axial flow compressors because of the thick boundary layers on the annulus walls.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the years}} {{a number of}} {{software}} packages {{have been developed to}} estimate the design, <b>off-design</b> and transient performance of various types of gas turbine engine. Most are used in-house by the various aero-engine manufacturers, but several software packages are available to the general public (e.g. NPSS http://www.npssconsortium.org, GasTurb http://www.gasturb.de, EngineSim http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12//airplane/ngnsim.html, GSP http://www.gspteam.com, PROOSIS http://www.proosis.com).|$|E
50|$|Plotted on the LHS are {{the results}} of several <b>off-design</b> calculations, showing the effect of {{throttling}} a jet engine from its design point condition. The line produced {{is similar to the}} working line shown above, but it is now superimposed on the compressor map and gives an indication of corrected shaft speed and compressor surge margin.|$|E
50|$|Fixed {{geometry}} {{machines are}} designed to operate at maximum efficiency condition. The efficiency of a fixed geometry machine depends on the flow coefficient and Reynolds number. For a constant Reynolds number as flow coefficient increases, efficiency also increases, reaches a maximum value and then decreases. Thus <b>off-design</b> operation is completely inefficient and may result in cavitation at higher flow rates.|$|E

5000|$|A {{compressor}} gives {{its best}} performance while operating at its design point {{but it is}} also expected to operate away from the design point.Therefore, knowledge about its behavior at <b>off-design</b> operation is also necessary.

50|$|Turbofan engines come in {{a variety}} of engine configurations. For a given engine cycle (i.e., same airflow, bypass ratio, fan {{pressure}} ratio, overall pressure ratio and HP turbine rotor inlet temperature), the choice of turbofan configuration has little impact upon the design point performance (e.g., net thrust, SFC), as long as overall component performance is maintained. <b>Off-design</b> performance and stability is, however, affected by engine configuration.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{development}} of the conical sections, adding canopies and fuselage areas, led to the [...] "osculating cones waverider", which develops several conical shock waves at different points on the body, blending them to produce a single shaped shock. The expansion to {{a wider range of}} compression surface flows allowed the design of waveriders with control of volume, upper surface shape, engine integration and centre of pressure position. Performance improvements and <b>off-design</b> analysis continued until 1970.|$|E
5000|$|General Electric began {{developing}} the YF120 for the ATF {{competition in the}} early 1980s. Unlike competitor Pratt & Whitney, GE elected against developing a conventional low bypass turbofan and instead chose to design a variable cycle engine. This decision was made {{as a result of}} the challenging ATF requirement of supercruise. This meant the engine had to produce a large amount of dry thrust (without afterburner) and therefore have high <b>off-design</b> efficiency ("design" [...] being standard cruise conditions).|$|E

50|$|Compared to an {{axial flow}} turbine, a radial turbine can employ a {{relatively}} higher pressure ratio (â‰ˆ4) per stage with lower flow rates. Thus these machines {{fall in the}} lower specific speed and power ranges. For high temperature applications rotor blade cooling in radial stages is {{not as easy as}} in axial turbine stages. Variable angle nozzle blades can give higher stage efficiencies in a radial turbine stage even at <b>off-design</b> point operation. In the family of hydro-turbines, Francis turbine is a very well-known IFR turbine which generates much larger power with a relatively large impeller.|$|E
