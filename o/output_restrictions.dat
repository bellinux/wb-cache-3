40|$|A {{review of}} the theory of multiplicative {{complexity}} and its application to common signal processing operations is presented. This review collects results on the multiplicative complexity of polynomial multiplication, products in extension fields, multivariate polynomial multiplication, and multiple products in the same extension field with one or more fixed polynomials. In addition, new results are obtained for the multiplicative complexity of multidimensional cyclic convolution, the one-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and convolutions and DFTs with input constraints or <b>output</b> <b>restrictions.</b> The multiplicative complexity of multidimensional cyclic convolution is determined for any possible combination of lengths in any number of dimensions, extending a result of Winograd for one- and two-dimensional cyclic convolution. This result is shown to be applicable in determining the multiplicative complexity of the one-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The multiplicative complexity of the DFT for all possible lengths is determined starting with Winograd's result for odd prime lengths and then extending it to power-of-prime lengths, power-of-two lengths, and finally to arbitrary lengths. The multiplicative complexity of systems of polynomial multiplication with constrained inputs is considered. An input constraint must imply a nontrivial factorization of one input polynomial for which one factor has coefficients only in the ground field if the multiplicative complexity is to be reduced over unconstrained polynomial multiplication. This result is applied to symmetric polynomial multiplication. The multiplicative complexity of polynomial products for which only selected outputs are needed is analyzed. Complexities are derived for polynomial products with decimated and truncated outputs, but no general rule is apparent for arbitrary <b>output</b> <b>restrictions.</b> The effect of input constraints and <b>output</b> <b>restrictions</b> on the multiplicative complexity of the discrete Fourier transform are considered.

40|$|The "ratchet effect" {{refers to}} a {{phenomenon}} where workers whose compensation is based on productivity strategically restrict their output, relative to their capability, because they rationally anticipate that high levels of output will be met with increased or "ratcheted-up" expectations in the future. While there is ample anecdotal evidence suggesting {{the presence of the}} ratchet effect in real workplaces, it is difficult to actually empirically identify <b>output</b> <b>restriction</b> among workers. In this study, we implement a novel experimental design using a real-effort work task and a piece-rate incentive scheme to directly test for the presence of the ratchet effect using two different methods for evaluating productivity: (i) when productivity is evaluated based on the output of each individual worker, and (ii) when productivity is evaluated collectively based on the output of a group of workers. We find strong evidence of the ratchet effect when productivity is evaluated at the individual-level. However, we find very little evidence of the ratchet effect when productivity is evaluated collectively at the group-level. We attribute the latter result to the free-riding incentive that emerges when productivity is evaluated at the group-level. Furthermore, we find the ratchet effect re-emerges if workers are able to communicate. Our experimental design, combined with using a real-effort work task, also allows us to shed light on an important dynamic implication of the ratchet effect that has not yet been examined in the literature 2 ̆ 013 the role of the ratchet effect on future productivity via learning-by-doing...|$|R

40|$|Competition law {{authorities}} {{around the}} world almost invariably make combating cartels an enforcement priority because such forms of collusive behaviour are unequivocally harmful to competition. Hard core cartel agreements typically involve {{one or more of}} the most anti-competitive forms of conduct — price-fixing, bid-rigging, market allocation and <b>output</b> <b>restrictions</b> — and frequently attract severe legal sanctions in most competition law jurisdictions.

40|$|A {{free market}} {{system based on}} both freedom of {{contract}} and protection of property principles operates challenged by demand and supply. Under a free market system, demand by consumers and supply by producers determine the price and quantity of a product in a market. Competition policy leads suppliers to compete among themselves in sales terms or conditions. Competition toward attracting consumers through lower prices is an important principle for working a free market. Competition law is supposed to protect {{the functioning of the}} market. However, it is against competition law principle for competitors to conspire to fix prices or to limit output. Price-fixing is the artificial setting or maintenance of prices at a certain level, usually higher than the level which would be normal without the price-fixing agreement. Sometimes, the competitors collude to maintain a level of production pre-arranged by themselves. Price-fixing and <b>output</b> <b>restriction</b> are typical to hard core cartels. The hard core cartels cause diverse negative aspects to the economy. The hard core cartels take away consumers 2 ̆ 7 benefits that competition among suppliers would have otherwise produced. Consumers in the normal markets purchase products by paying the price set by market mechanisms through the competition of suppliers. However, in a market where the sellers have agreed to set the price or the quantity of the product, consumers cannot avoid paying the higher price than in a market without the collusion. In addition, cartels cause price-inflexibility regardless of a change in economic circumstances, thereby leading to malfunctions in a free market system. Such malfunction is due to restraining competition among suppliers as an essential element of the free market mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1973 {{oil price}} shock, {{the history and}} {{behaviour}} of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have received considerable attention both in the academic literature and in the media. 1 Many conflicting theoretical and empirical interpretations {{about the nature of}} OPEC and its influence on world oil markets have been proposed. The debate is not centred on whether OPEC restricts output, but the reasons behind these restrictions. Some studies emphasize that production decisions are made with reference to budgetary needs which in turn depend on the absorptive capacity of the domestic economies (Teece, 1982). Others explain production cuts in the 1970 s in terms of the transfer of property rights from international oil companies to governments which tend to have lower discount rates (Johany, 1980; Mead, 1979). Others explain <b>output</b> <b>restrictions</b> in terms of coordinated actions of OPEC members. Within the literature, OPEC behaviour ranges from classic textbook cartel to two-block cartel (Hnyilicza and Pindyck, 1976), to clumsy cartel (Adelman, 1980), to dominant firm (Salant, 1976; Mabro, 1991), to loosely co-operating oligopoly, to residual firm monopolist (Adelman, 1982) and most recently to bureaucratic cartel (Smith, 2005). Others have suggested that OPEC oscillates between various positions but always acts as a vacillating federation of producers (see for instance Adelman, 1982; Smith, 2005). The existing empirical evidence has not helped narrow these different views. Griffin’s (1985) observation in the mid- 1980 s that the empirical studies tend to “reach onto the shelf of economic models to select one, to validate its choice by pointing to selected events not inconsistent with model’s prediction” still dominates the empirical approach to studying OPEC behaviour and its pricing power...|$|E

The economic weight of calf mortality was Dfl − 3. 83 per % and the marginal costs of dystocia were Dfl 59. 75 per cow per unit on the underlying liability scale. The economic value for birth weight was Dfl 5. 40 per kg for dairy farmers, Dfl − 4. 59 per kg for veal producers and Dfl − 6. 91 per kg for beef producers.
