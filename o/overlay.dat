5|$|Players can add non-Steam {{games to}} their libraries, {{allowing}} {{the game to}} be easily accessed from the Steam client and providing support where possible for Steam <b>Overlay</b> features. The Steam interface allows for user-defined shortcuts to be added. In this way, third-party modifications and games not purchased through the Steam Store can use Steam features. Valve sponsors and distributes some modifications free-of-charge; and modifications that use Steamworks can also use VAC, Friends, the server browser, and any Steam features supported by their parent game. For most games launched from Steam, the client provides an in-game <b>overlay</b> that can be accessed by a keystroke. From the <b>overlay,</b> the user can access his or her Steam Community lists and participate in chat, manage selected Steam settings, and access a built-in web browser without having to exit the game. Since the beginning of February 2011 as a beta version, the <b>overlay</b> also allows players to take screenshots of the games in process; it automatically stores these and allows the player to review, delete, or share them during or after his or her game session. As a full version on February 24, 2011, this feature was reimplemented so that users could share screenshots on websites of Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit straight from a user's screenshot manager.|$|E

50|$|Chain loading {{is similar}} to the use of <b>overlays.</b> Unlike <b>overlays,</b> however, chain loading replaces the {{currently}} executing program in its entirety. <b>Overlays</b> usually replace only a portion of the running program.

5|$|Development of Alien 8 began {{immediately}} {{after the release of}} Knight Lore, in which the Stamper brothers predicted that publishers would attempt to copy Knight Lore Filmation technology in other games.

However, the Amstrad release exclusively displayed dual-colours.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} with the isometric projection game engine known as Filmation II, {{which was used}} previously in Ultimate's 1985 ZX Spectrum game Nightshade. The Filmation engine {{was created by the}} Stamper brothers to portray 3D imagery. Filmation II used an image masking technique that drew and filled holes in the background, allowing the game to create composite structures out of pixelated drawings without visual <b>overlay,</b> despite the limitations platforms such as the ZX Spectrum offered.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} written by Chris Stamper, and {{graphics}} were designed by Tim Stamper. Alien 8 uses the same image masking technique as Knight Lore, which allows the developers to create composite structures out of stacked images without visual <b>overlay.</b> The technique was copyrighted by Ultimate as the Filmation game engine. As with its spiritual predecessor, the game is rendered isometric projection. The game was critically acclaimed upon release. Reviewers praised the game's graphics and innovation, however minor criticism was directed at its similarities to Knight Lore.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultrasound}} equipment must be of sufficiently {{high quality}} {{in order to}} give a correct image processing result, which can then provide invaluable information, mainly at the superficial level. It must be able to provide both color and Doppler imaging; technologies that developed alongside the development of ultrasound. The use of Doppler measurements which trace the echoes of the generated soundwaves received by the probe, enable the direction and the velocity of the blood flow, to be depicted. The <b>overlay</b> of color onto the Doppler information lets these images be seen more clearly.|$|E
40|$|<b>Overlaying</b> was {{a common}} nineteenth century {{explanation}} of sudden infant death while bedsharing. This thesis shows {{that in many cases}} the term <b>overlaying</b> was a misnomer, and instead it identifies infant <b>overlaying</b> death as a socio-structural historical event that can best be understood within a sociological and social constructionist framework. It expands on the work of Giddens, Elias and Archer to develop a theoretical perspective that incorporates ideas about structuration, sequestration, figuration and reflexivity. It also deploys concepts such as motherhood, infancy, infant care, the family and intimacy to explore and analyse its research materials and develops two further explanatory concepts; reflexive motherhood and the sequestration of infancy. The thesis uses ideas around discourse as socio-structural conditions of action in order to expand current understanding of <b>overlaying</b> death, and it explores and analyses public representations of <b>overlaying</b> during the {{nineteenth and early twentieth centuries}} to detail the discourse of <b>overlaying.</b> It goes on to identify cases of <b>overlaying</b> in Somers Town, St Pancras, c 1900; and it shows the influence of social conditions in regard to the way such deaths were interpreted. It then examines other cases of sudden infant death in bed through the case notes of pathologist Dr Ludwig Freyberger, and analyses these in terms of the domestic setting and the body. It goes on to detail and analyse a dispute between Coroner John Troutbeck, Dr Freyberger and the GPs of south west London to show the ways in which the <b>overlaying</b> discourse was deployed to support the claims and positions of those involved. <b>Overlaying</b> subsequently became detached from the domestic context in which it was embedded and used to support discourses around infant mortality, maternal ‘ignorance’, medicine, national efficiency and temperance. The thesis provides a historiography of infant <b>overlaying</b> death and concludes that <b>overlaying</b> was constructed as social category of death through the actions of individuals in extensive networks of interdependence in relation to socio-structural conditions...|$|R

Leonardo created a map of Cesare Borgia's stronghold, a town plan of Imola {{in order to win}} his patronage. Maps were extremely rare at the time and it would have seemed like a new concept. Upon seeing it, Cesare hired Leonardo as his chief military engineer and architect. Later in the year, Leonardo produced another map for his patron, one of Chiana Valley, Tuscany, so as to give his patron a better <b>overlay</b> of the land and greater strategic position. He created this map in conjunction with his other project of constructing a dam from the sea to Florence, in order to allow a supply of water to sustain the canal during all seasons.|$|E
