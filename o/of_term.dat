40|$|A phrase {{discovery}} {{is a method}} of identifying sequences <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> in a database. First, a selection {{of one or more}} relevant sequences <b>of</b> <b>terms.</b> such as relevant text, is provided. Next, several shorter sequences <b>of</b> <b>terms,</b> such as phrases, are extracted from the provided relevant sequences <b>of</b> <b>terms.</b> The extracted sequences <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> are then reduced through a culling process.

The five permanent members hold veto power over UN resolutions, allowing a permanent member to block adoption of a resolution, though not debate.

A bill passed in 2000 grants the Senate President the honorary title of Lieutenant Governor, but this title is rarely used in practice and the terms of the Senate President do not correspond with governorships. The same bill states that the line of succession after the Senate President will be the Speaker of the House of Delegates, followed by the state attorney general, the state auditor and former governors, in inverse order <b>of</b> <b>term,</b> that are in residence in the state {{at the time of the}} vacancy.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{treats the}} {{problems}} of discriminability and separability for a wide class of infinite sets <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> in the pure lambda calculus. The technique used is a generalization of the Bohm out technique for extracting substitutional instances from the sets <b>of</b> <b>terms.</b> A unification <b>of</b> this technique on an appropriate class <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> enables {{the construction of an}} algorithm of extraction which leads to the construction of a discriminator for an infinite set <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> having the distinctive paths. In [11] some conditions under which a r. e. set <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> is a numeral system were done. For the opposite direction, i. e. construction of the distinctive paths for the discriminable or separable set <b>of</b> <b>terms,</b> we used the sequentiality and continuity theorem with a combination of a slight generalization of the Wadsworth 2 ̆ 7 s version of the lambda calculus (cf.
