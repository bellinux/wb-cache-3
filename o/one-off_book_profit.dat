In this simple framework we describe basic scenarios in which decreasing IRS audit rates and weaker fiscal discipline appear endogenously, that is, when growing financial sophistication is paralleled by changes in the information on <b>book</b> <b>profits</b> available to the tax authority, or by changes in the distribution of the <b>book</b> <b>profits.</b> In contrast to other views, these scenarios involve simple explicative mechanisms that do not rely on the idea of relative changes in the IRS resources or in the applied penalties.

Many of the current asset management models that are found in financial management literature assume <b>book</b> <b>profit</b> maximization as the basic financial purpose. These <b>book</b> <b>profit</b> based models could be lacking in what relates to another aim like maximization of enterprise value. The corporate value creation strategy is executed {{with a focus on}} risk and uncertainty. Firms hold cash for a variety of reasons. Generally, cash balances held in a firm can be called considered, precautionary, speculative, transactional and intentional. The first are the result of management anxieties. Managers fear the negative part of the risk and hold cash to hedge against it. Second, cash balances are held to use chances that are created by the positive part of the risk equation. Next, cash balances are the result of the operating needs of the firm. In this article, we analyze the relation between these types of cash balances and risk. This article presents the discussion about relations between firm net working investment policy and as result operating cash balances and firm value. This article also contains propositions for marking levels of precautionary cash balances and speculative cash balances.
