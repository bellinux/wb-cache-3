The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the attitude, belief, and preference of Saudi students regarding working in a coeducation <b>online</b> cooperative <b>learning</b> environment. The participants of the study were 707 students from the Saudi students in the USA. An electronic questionnaire was developed by the researcher for the purpose in this study. The study concluded that Saudi students from both genders showed a generally positive attitude toward learning in a coeducational <b>online</b> cooperative <b>learning</b> environment. The study also revealed that the participants believe that coeducational <b>online</b> cooperative <b>learning</b> will be possible, appropriate, and effective if applied in Saudi Arabia.

Most studies deal with social shared regulation focusing on collective individual regulations during collaboration and absence {{of one of these}} processes would affect mathematical problem solving during collaborative learning. This study contributes to the emerging research on social shared regulation in collaborative learning where collaborative groups are analyzed as the unit of analysis. Participants include 21 students who are learning mathematics at a vocational training institution in an <b>online</b> collaborative <b>learning</b> setting. Students' discussion scripts were collected and analyzed to identify the group strategies to regulate learning during solving Mathematics problem based on a coding scheme.

This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{particle}} filtering framework for multi-target tracking by using <b>online</b> <b>learned</b> class-specific and instancespecific cues, called Data-Driven Particle Filtering (DDPF). The learned cues include an <b>online</b> <b>learned</b> geometrical model for excluding detection outliers that violate geometrical constraints, global pose estimators {{shared by all}} targets for particle refinement, and online Boosting based appearance models which select discriminative features to distinguish different individuals. Targets are clustered into two categories. Separatedtarget is tracked by an ISPF (incremental self-tuning particle filtering) tracker, in which particles are incrementally drawn and tuned to their best states by a learned global pose estimator; target-group is tracked by a joint-state particle filtering method in which occlusion reasoning is conducted. Experimental results on challenging datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is (1) to examine whether there is a {{cultural}} gap in student perceptions of <b>online</b> collaborative <b>learning,</b> and (2) to investigate to what extent student perceptions, motivation, and learning strategies change over time due to the actual involvement in a collaborative e-learning environment. Design/methodology/approach - A parallel e-learning environment for a first-year university course was implemented for a Flemish group (n = 217) at Ghent University and a Chinese group (n = 165) at Beijing Normal University. Student perceptions of the <b>online</b> collaborative <b>learning</b> environment and their motivation and learning strategies before and after the e-learning experience were measured. Findings - The findings show that the Flemish group perceived the <b>online</b> collaborative <b>learning</b> environment more positively compared to the Chinese group. However, Chinese students’ motivation and learning strategies changed significantly towards a way that is more in line with a social-constructivist learning approach after the <b>online</b> collaborative <b>learning</b> experience. Practical implications - The current results indicate that students from different cultural contexts perceive <b>online</b> collaborative <b>learning</b> environments differently. Specific cultural adaptations in e-learning design could be considered when an e-learning environment is to be implemented cross-culturally. Originality/value - This study can help both Chinese and Western instructors to become aware of different perceptions of <b>online</b> collaborative <b>learning</b> and to be more supportive to the students...|$|R

Present study, irrespective of being a scale analysis, is at the same time a qualitative research. It is executed via scan model. Study group of research consists of collectively 222 students. Firstly the original scale has been translated by two educational technologists who are efficient in both Turkish and English languages. The validity of scale’s original factor structure within Turkish culture has been tested via confirmatory factor analysis. In order to measure the reliability of scale, internal consistency analyses have been conducted on data. In order to detect self-regulated learning levels of students; frequency, percentage, arithmetical means, standard deviation and t tests have been employed. In differentiation analyses p< 0, 05 significance level has been considered sufficient. As a result it can reasonably be argued that “Online Self-Regulated Learning Scale” is a valid and reliable scale that can be employed in detecting <b>online</b> self-regulated <b>learning</b> levels of university students in Turkey.
