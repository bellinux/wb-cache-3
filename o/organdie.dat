40|$|Ultrastructural {{features}} of the regressing corpus luteum have been studied in the ewe {{at the end of}} the estrous cycle. Luteal cells secrete densely-staining granules which have been reported to contain progesterone. This process appears to be maximal at Day 10 of the cycle and begins to taper off noticeably at Day 12. The secretory activity declines gradually till Day 14, but up to this time the fine structure of other cytoplasmic <b>organdIes</b> in the luteal cell shows no remarkable change, save for a gradual increase in the number of autophagocytic bodies which first begin to appear at Day 12. In contrast, on Day 15 there is evidence of marked degeneration; the luteal cells are shrunken, granule secretion has ceased, autophagocytic bodies are numerous and lipid droplets, rarely seen in the fully functional cell, are present in abundance, Lysosomes are observed at all stages of the cycle and there is no dramatic increase in their number towards the end, In some cells at Day 15 the process of degeneration has advanced to the stage where the fine structure of organ-elles is no longer recognizable and within autophagocytic bodies there are large sites associated with acid phosphatase activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} organelle {{responsible for}} the storage and subsequent release of relaxin from the pregnant rat luteal cell is presented in this article, Rela. xin was localized in 100 - to 200 -nm diame-ter membrane-bound granules found in the corpus luteum of pregnant rat ovaries. Antiserum to porcine relaxin and goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin C (lgG) -colloidal gold were used to label the hormone in luteal tissue from Days 17 and 20 of pregnancy. The gold particles were limited to the small granules with none found in mitochondria or larger (300 - 500 nm diameter) membrane-bound <b>organdIes</b> resembling lysosomes. Gold particles were not deposited on the granules of control tissue in which the porcine relaxin antiserum was substituted with normal rabbit serum or porcine relaxin antiserum absorbed with purified porcine relaxin, Exocytosis involving the incor-poration of the granule membrane into the cell membrane followed by release of product was only once observed. However, in all tissue sections studied, the membrane sac surrounding the granule was seen to attach to the cell membrane by a filamentous structure. Empty vesicles (100 - 200 nm diameter) which appear to have discharged the granular product were also noted around the cell periphery...|$|R

40|$|The intratesticular {{localization}} of enzymes of androgen and estrogen biosynthesis was {{studied in}} the ground squirrel (Citellus lateralis). In mature animals, interstitium and tubules were isolated by manual dissection. Microsomes were prepared and enzymes assayed by analysis of product formation after incubation with appropriate H-labeled substrates. In the immature testis, tubules and interstitium are not readily separable; thus, distribution was inferred after analysis of whole testicular microsomes from control, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) -treated, and luteinizing hormone (LH) -treated animals. To verify the cellular composition of tissues {{and the status of}} steroidogenic <b>organdIes</b> in Leydig and Sertoli cells, samples were also analyzed by light and electron microscopy. In mature squirrels, enzymes of androgen biosynthesis were concentrated in the interstitium; however, levels present in the tubules were sufficient to account for a substantial fraction of whole testicular activity (1 / 3 to 1 / 5). By contrast, virtually all of the testicular aroma-tase was accounted for by that in the seminiferous tubules. The purity of these fractions was checked by light microscopy; they showed little cross-contamination. In whole testicular micro-somes of immature squirrels, androgen biosynthetic enzymes had a much lower specific activit...|$|R
40|$|The CD 2 {{receptor}} on T-Iymphocytes plays a {{major part}} in mediating adhesive interactions via the LFA- 3 Ilgand and in transducing signals for lymphocyte activation. In this study the expression, function, and internalization of the CD 2 receptor was investigated in resting and activated murine T-cells. Surface Iodination of intact lymphocytes showed that both types of cell expressed this antigen as a single polypeptide of 63 KDa, and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that there was {{four times as much}} CD 2 on Iymphoblasts as on resting cells. Moreover, the CD 2 receptor had a more prominent role In the adhesion of the activated lymphocytes to extravascular cells than in the binding of resting cells. Only activated lymphocytes Internalized CD 2, in {{the presence or absence of}} the anti-CD 2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 12 - 15, more than 80 % of the 12 - 15 /CD 2 complex being removed from the cell surface within 24 hr. Application of 125 l-labelled mAb 12 - 15 followed by subcellular fractionation on Percoll gradients showed that the complex was internal-ized Initially Into a low-density compartment and subsequently transported to heavy-density <b>organdIes,</b> in which it was degraded. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed that immediately after the initial binding of mAb 12 - 15 to the lymphoblasts, the gol...|$|R
40|$|Adult male rabbits were {{subjected}} to either bilateral vasectomy or a bilateral sham operation. Several portions of the epididymis and vas deferens were studied with the light and electron microscopes at intervals up to 9 months after operation. In vasectomized rabbits, the epididymis and proximal vas deferent were distended with sperm and expanded progressively from 2 weeks through 4 months after vasectomy. This expansion continued in one rabbit killed at 6 months and in one killed 9 months after vasectomy. However, in the remaining 3 rabbits killed 6 or 9 months after vasectomy, the epididymidis and vas deferens were less distended than in other vasectomized animals, and in 2 of these there was evidence that sperm escaped the male duct system and under-went phagocytosis in a spermatic granuloma in the surrounding connective tissue. Despite the distention, the epithelium of the epididymis and vas deferens of vasectomized rabbits remained columnar. The epithelium also continued to be functionally active {{as indicated by the}} persistence of the characteristic complement of cellular <b>organdIes,</b> including vacuoles and lysosomes thought to be involved in absorption and smooth endoplasmic reticulum that may be involved in secretion. The epithelium of the cauda epididymidis and proximal part of the vas deferens in both vasectomized and sham-operated animals fixed 2 to 6 months after operation was highly folded and had many apical cytoplasmic projections. The origin of this change is unknown, but it may be related to seasonal variations in activity of the epithelium...|$|R

40|$|The synthesis, {{intracellular}} transport, and secretion {{of proteins}} were studied {{in different parts}} of the mouse epididymis. Adult mice were administered [3 Hjleucine, and at subsequent intervals between 10 mm and 12 h two animals were killed. Samples of initial, middle, and terminal seg-ments were prepared for light and electron microscope radioautography. In the initial and middle segments, the proportion of silver grains showed successive peaks over endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, coated vesicles, and the apical cell surface. Labeling of luminal contents increased at the end of this sequence, at 1 - 2 h after injection of precursor. These events, however, occurred earlier in the middle segment than in the initial segment. Similar structures were labeled in the terminal segment, but radioactivity of the rough endoplasmic reticulum remained relatively high, peaks in labeling of other <b>organdIes</b> were not sharp, and luminal labeling did not rise as much as in the more proximal segments. The results suggest that the synthesis and transport of proteins was more rapid in the middle than in the initial segment. At least in the middle segment, the sparsely granulated reticulum appeared to participate in protein synthesis along with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In both initial and middle segments, coated vesicles may have been involved in transport from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface and lumen. Relatively little protein secretion occurred in the terminal segment, where much newly synthesized protein appeared to be retained within the epithelial cells. The findings are related to the function of sperm maturation in initial and middle segments and of sperm storage in the terminal segment...|$|R
40|$|The fine {{structure}} of granulosa lutein {{cells of the}} corpus luteum from pregnant monkeys (Macaca mulatta) is described. Corpora lutea were obtained within the span of expected normal delivery from intact mothers, {{as well as from}} mothers which were hypophysectomized (56 - 73 days), and those which were fetectomized (107 - 119 days) with the placentas maintained in situ until near expected time of delivery. The gramulosa luteim cells from all groups had fine structural characteristics indicative of active steroidogenesis. The slight differences in the {{fine structure}} of these granulosa cells involved factors of concentration and size, as well as appearance of several <b>organdIes.</b> Cells of the corpus luteum from hypophysectomized animals had smaller mitochondria, often associated with lamellar structures, and microfilaments occurred more frequently than in intact animals. Mitochondria in the luteal cells from fetectomized monkeys with large osmiophilic inclusions were more numerous and agranular ER and Golgi were increased when compared to luteal cells from intact or hypophysectomized animals. Initial luteolysis was noticed in the CL of intact and hypophysectomized monkeys, but to a lesser extent in the fetectomized animals. Onset of luteolysis was indicated by obliteration of some blood vessels, shrinkage of cells and their nuclei, and distention of the cisternae of the granular endoplasmic reticulum. Dense fibrillar structures and collagen fibers accumulated in some of the perivascular and extracellular spaces. Various nexuses were formed at areas of contact of cellular projections and the cell surface in every group of monkeys. Fine structural features of CL from late pregnancy in rhesus monkeys support other evidence that these granulosa lutein cells are active in steroid synthesis...|$|R
40|$|The fine {{structure}} of the testes was examined in Sprague-Dawley rats fed an essential fatty acid deficient (EFAD) diet immediately after weaning. Between 85 and 110 days of life, experimental and control animals were fertile. The histology of the seminiferous tubules after 1 3 weeks on the EFAD diet appeared normal. The ultrastructure, however, revealed distention of the smooth (SER) and rough (RER) endoplasmic reticulum and of the cisternae associated with the junctional complexes of the Sertohi cells. The remaining animals fed the EFAD diet were divided into 2 groups of 5 animals each. One group received 0. 10 mg of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) {{and the other one}} 0. 9 % NaCI. The daily injections were administered intrascrotally for 11 weeks in order to cover more than the mean length of the spermatogenic cycle in Sprague-Dawley rats. In both groups, male fertility had decreased and the histology of the testes showed prominent vacuohization in some of the tubules after 24 weeks on the diet. This was more pronounced in the saline than in the PGE 2 treated animals. Vacuoles dominated the cytoplasm of the Sertoli cell. In addition, the ultrastructure of some of the <b>organdIes</b> (mitochondria, SER, RER and junctional cisternae) was altered. PGE 2 treatment seemed to achieve some repair of these structural changes. These are the first fine structural observations of the testes in EFAD rats with and without PGE 2 administration. Our ultrastructural findings suggest that the primary target in the semini-ferous tubules is the Sertoli cell. In the EFAD rat, the normal integrity of this cell population is disturbed which may account for the male infertility...|$|R

Using computerassisted three-dimensional serial electron microscopic reconstruction, we describe the progressive cytoskeletal and structural changes of PC 12 neurites at different stages in their differentiation. Developmental changes in these neurites can be characterized by two major transitions. First, microtubules (MTs), which define the longitudinal axis of the neurite, increase in number leading to a more cylindrical and uniform neurite shape. Second, there are major changes in the relative numbers of other <b>organdie</b> types, which reflect the functional specialization of the neurite.
