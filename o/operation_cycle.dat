The remainder, including over 6,000 Highlanders, were taken prisoner on 12 June. At Le Havre, from 10 to 13 June, [...] troops from Arkforce, other British {{units in the}} port and Allied forces were evacuated; attempts by the Franco-British to prepare a national redoubt in Brittany came to nothing. <b>Operation</b> <b>Cycle</b> was followed by Operation Ariel from 14 to 25 June, in which another [...] were embarked from Cherbourg, St. Malo and other Atlantic and Mediterranean ports, until the Armistice of 22 June 1940.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Operation</b> <b>Cycle</b> is {{the name}} of the {{evacuation}} of Allied troops from Le Havre, in the Pays de Caux of Upper Normandy from [...] 1940, towards the end of the Battle of France, during the Second World War. The operation was preceded by the better known rescue of [...] and French soldiers from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo [...] On 20 May, the Germans had captured Abbeville at the mouth of the Somme and cut off the main Allied armies in the north. South of the river, the Allies improvised defences and made local counter-attacks, to dislodge the Germans from bridgeheads on the south bank and re-capture river crossings for an advance northwards to regain contact with the armies in northern France and Flanders.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{equipment}} was embarked on the evacuation ships but lack of reliable {{information about the}} progress of the German Army towards the coast, rumours and alarmist reports, led some operations to be terminated early and much {{equipment was}} destroyed or left behind. The official evacuation ended on 25 June, in conformity with the terms of the Armistice of 22 June 1940 agreed by the French and German authorities but informal departures continued from French Mediterranean ports until 14 August From the end of Operation Dynamo at Dunkirk, <b>Operation</b> <b>Cycle</b> from Le Havre, elsewhere along the Channel coast and the termination of Operation Ariel, another [...] were rescued, bringing the total of military and civilian personnel returned to Britain during the Battle of France to [...] British troops.|$|E

50|$|A normal relay uses a {{wire coil}} and the {{mechanical}} {{movement of the}} metal contacts to switch the load on and off. The metal contacts may weld shut after repeated <b>operation</b> <b>cycles.</b> If this happens, the machine would continue running if the operator pressed the emergency stop pushbutton.

30|$|It {{is already}} {{well known that}} there are {{significant}} differences regarding the emissions, especially particulate matter (PM) emissions, of old and modern as well as automatically and not automatically controlled biomass based residential heating systems. This concerns their magnitude {{as well as their}} chemical composition. In order to investigate emission factors for particulate emissions and the chemical compositions of the PM emissions over typical whole day <b>operation</b> <b>cycles,</b> a project on the determination and characterisation of PM emissions from the most relevant small-scale biomass combustion systems was performed at the BIOENERGY 2020 + GmbH, Graz, Austria, in cooperation with the Institute for Process and Particle Engineering, Graz University of Technology. The project was based on test stand measurements, during which relevant operation parameters (gaseous emissions, boiler load, flue gas temperature, combustion chamber temperature etc.) as well as PM emissions have been measured and PM samples have been taken and forwarded to chemical analyses. Firstly, typical whole day <b>operation</b> <b>cycles</b> for residential biomass combustion systems were specified for the test runs. Thereby automatically fed and automatically controlled boilers, manually fed and automatically controlled boilers as well as manually fed stoves were distinguished. The results show a clear correlation between the gaseous emissions (CO and OGC) and the PM 1 emissions. It is indicated that modern biomass combustion systems emit significantly less gaseous and PM emissions than older technologies (up to a factor of 100). Moreover, automatically fed systems emit much less gaseous and PM emissions than manually fed batch-combustion systems. PM emissions from modern and automatically controlled systems mainly consist of alkaline metal salts, while organic aerosols and soot dominate the composition of aerosols from old and not automatically controlled systems. As an important result comprehensive data concerning gaseous and PM emissions of different old and modern biomass combustion systems over whole day <b>operation</b> <b>cycles</b> are now available. Derived from these data, correlations between burnout quality, particulate emissions as well as particle composition of the PM emissions can be deduced.|$|R

40|$|Qualification of motors {{for deep}} space under extreme thermal environments to be {{encountered}} during the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission {{is required to}} verify the reliability and validate mission assurance requirements. The motor assembly must survive all ground operations, plus the nominal 670 Martian-day (or sol) mission that includes summer and winter seasons of the Mars environment. The motor assembly was tested and characterized under extreme temperature conditions with reference to hardware requirements. The motor assembly has been proved to be remarkably robust and displayed no sign of degradation due to the 3 X (three times per JPL design principles) thermal environmental exposure to the punishing Mars surface <b>operations</b> <b>cycles.</b> The motor characteristics obtained before, during, and post-test comparisons for the surface <b>operations</b> <b>cycles</b> are within measurement error of one another. The motors withstood/survived 2, 010 extreme temperature cycles with a Delta T of 190 C deep temperature cycles, representing three times the expected thermal cycling exposure during the MSL surface operations. The qualification test hardware elements (A 200 motor assembly, encoders, and resolver) have not shown any signs of degradation due to the PQV (Package Qualification and Verification) testing. The test hardware has demonstrated sufficient life to survive the deep thermal cycles associated with MSL mission surface operations for three lives...|$|R
40|$|Axial flux {{permanent}} magnet (AFPM) machine type has some advantages such as compressed packaging, easy handling, and safety operation. In this paper the proper structure selection of AFPM machine for {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (HEV) application {{is one of the}} aims. To reduce the losses and the total volume of machine, the coreless TORUS-NS type machine is selected. Designing of this machine, to obtain a wide speed range with high efficiency, low cogging torque and high torque value, as in-wheel direct-drive AFPM machine for HEV, is investigated. The operation performance in low and medium speed ranges is studied. A new design method based on multi speed design (MSD) strategy is proposed. Using this method with a coreless type of stators, the total AFPM machine efficiency at the HEV <b>operation</b> <b>cycles</b> could be improved. Performance analysis of this in-wheel AFPM machine is done using finite-element method (FEM). FEM analysis of the single-speed design (SSD) method is also done. MSD and SSD designed machines are applied in HEV and simulated using urban and highway cycles. The obtained results show the better performance of HEV, using the MSD based designed machine in all <b>operation</b> <b>cycles.</b> The experimental results obtained from sample practical prototype, confirm the analytical method...|$|R

50|$|MnO2 {{has always}} been a good {{candidate}} for electrode materials due to its high energy capacity, non-toxicity and cost effectiveness. However, lithium-ion insertion into the crystal matrix during charging/discharging cycle would cause significant volumetric expansion. To counteract this effect during <b>operation</b> <b>cycle,</b> scientists recently proposed the idea of producing a Li-enriched MnO2 nanowire with a nominal stoichiometry of Li2MnO3 as anode materials for LIB. This new proposed anode materials enable the battery cell to reach an energy capacity of 1279 mAh gâˆ’1 at current density of 500 mA even after 500 cycles. This performance is much higher than that of pure MnO2 anode or MnO2 nanowire anode cells.|$|E
