Oscar makes Kevin promise not to reveal anything. During the day, Angela {{constantly}} makes unconscious double entendres and foreshadowing, sorely tempting Kevin to let <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> knows. Afraid that Kevin cannot keep his secret, Oscar tries to frame Kevin so that Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) will have him fired, but confesses to Toby that he lied. Later, Robert visits the office, and Oscar acts unnaturally nervous around him. Before Angela's suspicions can be aroused, Kevin interrupts to cheer Robert on about his upcoming election. Oscar says {{to the camera}} that he is proud of how Kevin kept the secret, but Kevin then reveals that he momentarily forgot all about the secret, and begins to laugh uncontrollably.|$|E

Sarah leads Chuck {{up to the top}} floor of a skyscraper and attempts to call in an evacuation while Chuck explains what happened when he uploaded the Intersect. Sarah then aims her gun at Chuck when Casey arrives on the roof. Sarah warns Casey that Chuck uploaded the Intersect and tells Chuck that their mutual friend Bryce is dead. Chuck then flashes on the building where the visiting General Stanfield (Dale Dye) is giving an address and puts together all the pieces from the flashes he had been having: the stranger in the Large Mart is a demolitions expert and has set a bomb to destroy the conference. Chuck, Sarah, and Casey locate the bomb in the conference hall and Chuck defuses the bomb by deliberately infecting the machine with a computer virus.|$|E

25|$|Whit Haydn {{was born}} to {{minister}} (Disciples of Christ) William J. Hadden, Jr. and Margaret Shumate (daughter of Whitney Shumate and Jessamine Shumate), an elementary school librarian.

This became the beginning of a lifelong fascination.|$|E

He may have lost his diplomatic career but he received much posthumous acclaim.|$|E

25|$|Before the assassination, the British {{intelligence}} services identified Talaat in Stockholm {{where he had}} gone for a few days. The British intelligence first planned to apprehend him in Berlin where {{he was planning to}} return, but then changed its mind because it feared the complications this would create in Germany. Another view in British intelligence was that Talaat should be apprehended by the Royal Navy at sea while returning from Scandinavia by ship. In the end, it was decided to let him return to Berlin, find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was trying to accomplish with his activities abroad, and to establish direct contact with him before giving the final verdict. This was achieved with the help of Aubrey Herbert.|$|E
25|$|Dōgen Zenji (道元禅師; 19 January 1200 22 September 1253), {{also known}} as Dōgen Kigen (道元希玄), Eihei Dōgen (永平道元), Koso Joyo Daishi (高祖承陽大師), or Bussho Dento Kokushi (仏性伝東国師), was a Japanese Buddhist priest, writer, poet, philosopher, {{and founder of the}} Sōtō school of Zen in Japan. Originally ordained as a monk in the Tendai School in Kyoto, he was {{ultimately}} dissatisfied with its teaching and traveled to China to seek <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> believed to be a more authentic Buddhism. He remained there for five years, finally training under Tiantong Rujing, an eminent teacher of the Chinese Caodong lineage. Upon his return to Japan, he began promoting the meditation practice of zazen through literary works such as Fukan zazengi and Bendōwa. He eventually broke relations completely with the powerful Tendai School, and, after several years of likely friction between himself and the establishment, left Kyoto for the mountainous countryside where he founded the monastery Eihei-ji, which remains the head temple of the Sōtō school today.|$|E
25|$|Fabrizio ruled for {{the state}} that News 12 had {{to turn over the}} complete, {{unedited}} interview. While News 12 had argued that the state had failed to demonstrate any basis for supposing that Bonie had confessed to the crime off camera, the judge said that the prosecution sought to learn whether he had made admissions relevant to the case. Raimundi's narration described Bonie making positive statements about his relationship with Moore. Even the defense agreed the issue of the Section 8 applications was a central and relevant one in the case. The judge did not find that Bonie had been promised confidentiality by News 12, and there was no possible other way {{for the state}} to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> might have said that was not broadcast. The judge's one concession to News 12 was that he would review the recorded interview in camera and release to the prosecution only those sections that discussed Bonie and Moore's landlord-tenant relationship and/or the Section 8 issue.|$|E

5000|$|Mumbler. Mumbler is more {{reserved}} than Grumble, but has his {{own sense}} of mean-ness that he exhibits in his twisted sense of humor.

5000|$|A {{variation}} of the proverb appeared as line 495 in the play Asinaria by Plautus: [...] "Lupus est homo homini, non homo, quom qualis sit non novit", which has been translated as [...] "Man is no man, but a wolf, to a stranger," [...] or more precisely [...] "A man is a wolf rather than a man to another man, when he hasn't yet found <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> like." ...|$|R
25|$|His family {{stated that}} Tobares' enthusiasm for work went {{down a few}} months before he disappeared. He told his sister that he was scared, and one time he called her sobbing. In March 2013, he spoke to his sister and told her that he wanted to return to Argentina. They believe that Tobares was kidnapped because he might have seen {{something}} suspicious while on the job that his employers did not want him to see. Tobares worked at Hotelito Desconocido and Nudoki Sushi Bar, but he was also a hired chef for private parties; his family told investigators that Tobares was sometimes taken by the CJNG, Tobares' last employer, to their private islands in western Mexico to cook for their exclusive events. He was not allowed to leave for a few days and was prohibited from using his cellphone while he was there. His family believes that in one of those private parties, Tobares saw something suspicious and began asking third-parties to clarify what he saw. When the CJNG found <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing, Gerardo reportedly threatened him and told him to ask those question to his face. A week before his disappearance, Gerardo reportedly ordered Tobares to close down the Asian restaurant and fire all of the employees.|$|E

500|$|In , Jason Thompson {{referred}} to Monkey Punch's original manga as [...] "a crazy, groovy 1960s world of dynamite and backstabbing, hippies and gangsters", and considered it [...] "a fascinating homage to Mad magazine and a four star example of comics as pure comedy." [...] He rated the series {{four out of}} four stars. Allen Divers of Anime News Network (ANN) praised the strong writing and action; however, {{he felt that the}} art was too primitive. Otaku USAs Daryl Surat was also put off by the art, saying he couldn't tell most character apart and had a hard time figuring <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was looking at. In The Rough Guide to Manga, Jason S. Yadao highlighted the example of how Lupin wearing a hat looks exactly like Zenigata. However, he considered it a successful plot device in once chapter that while it may take several attempts to understand, eventually pays off. He included the series in his list of 50 essential manga. Many of the first volumes of the English edition of the Lupin III manga released by Tokyopop made it onto ICv2's list of top 50 graphic novels, as well as later volumes from the series.|$|E
500|$|The plot of Silver Star Story Complete remains true to the {{original}} Sega CD version written by Kei Shigema. [...] Novelist Keisuke Shigematsu was recruited as the remake's scenario writer, and was tasked with expanding the previous script written by Shigema to make the game more current. As in {{the original}} version, players {{assume the role of}} Alex, a young boy who hopes to become a great hero like his idol, the legendary Dragonmaster Dyne. At the insistence of his fortune-hunting friend Ramus, Alex travels to the nearby Dragon's Cave with his cat-like companion Nall, and sweetheart Luna, to seek a precious gem. When the team reaches the cave's interior, they find Quark, an aged, wise dragon who sees hidden potential in Alex, and beckons him to travel the world and become its protector as the new Dragonmaster. Returning home, the group expresses mutual interest in Alex's quest; Ramus wishes to sell the dragon gem at a large city, Nall wants to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is, and Luna merely to protect Alex. The group sets off across the frontier to the port town of Saith to continue their journey.|$|E
500|$|Some critics, however, were displeased {{with the}} film's long running time {{and lack of}} action scenes. [...] "The film gets mired in the {{inevitable}} red tape of police investigations," [...] wrote Bob Longino of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, who also felt that the film [...] "stumbles to a rather unfulfilling conclusion" [...] and [...] "seems to {{last as long as}} the Oscars." [...] Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer felt that [...] "Mr. Fincher's flair for casting is the major asset of his curiously attenuated return to the serial-killer genre. I keep saying 'curiously' with regard to Mr. Fincher, because I can't really figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is up to in Zodiac – with its two-hour-and-37-minute running time for what struck me as a shaggy-dog narrative." [...] Christy Lemire wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle that [...] "Jake Gyllenhaal is both the central figure and the weakest link...
