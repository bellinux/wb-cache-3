40|$|Shaded relief maps {{provide an}} {{appealing}} visualization of landforms and hilly terrain. This paper considers {{two aspects of}} their construction: simplification of terrain, and effective feature depiction through exaggerated shading. Simplification involves choosing a level-of-detail appropriate to the scale of reproduction and the desired emphasis of the map. We will model this process as a digital filtering operation applied to regularly sampled elevation data. <b>Hill</b> <b>shading</b> techniques for indicating terrain slope have seemed natural candidates for automation using bump-mapping. However, naïve application of bump mapping to elevation data fails to reproduce the distinctive character of <b>hill</b> <b>shading</b> painted by a skilled cartographer. Examples of manual <b>hill</b> <b>shading</b> often feature idealized shading that emphasizes conceptually important terrain features like ridge lines. We treat this as a nonphotorealistic rendering problem, and propose a new shading model that attempts to model this illustrative technique...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: There is {{extensive}} {{knowledge on}} how to represent terrain using various relief depiction methods, such as <b>hill</b> <b>shading</b> and cliff drawing in cartographic products using large-scale maps. However, the relevance and correct use of topographic information nowadays in small-scale maps {{does not seem to}} be of high priority. This information that is frequently poorly depicted in such products can be crucial for the general acceptance of a map and more often determines whether the cartographic representation is beneficial. Therefore all possibilities of terrain visualization in these scales must be considered. The correct scale dependent use of digital and/or analog terrain information such as <b>hill</b> <b>shading,</b> cliff depiction, land cover and land use, as well as availability of elevation data must be examined as well as judged from a cartographic constructive and design perspective. This contribution gives an overview about existing visualization methods and approaches for small-scale maps with a focus on the experience and production process during the creation of an overview map of Europe (scale 1 : 5 Mio.) and the topographic overview map for the Hydrological Atlas of Austria (scale 1 : 1 Mio.) ...|$|R
