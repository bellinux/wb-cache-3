ENaC is composed of three homologuous subunits, ?, ?, and ? and defines a new gene family, the DEG/ENaC superfamily.

A set of measurement was carried out with elderly cardiac surgery patients. The experiments comprised two to five measurements per patient, each including a one-minute follow-up, after which the cuff was slowly inflated over the systolic blood pressure. Systolic pressure errors were defined and correlations with other specific values, like pressure rise time, pulse wave velocity, systolic pressure, augmentation, arm circumference and body mass index were calculated. These indices may be affected by arterial stiffness, a common source of errors in blood pressure measurements. With a value of – 0. 52, the character which correlated best with systolic error {{was found to be}} the peak level of the first derivative of the pressure signal. Also rise time (10 %… 90 %) exhibits a moderate correlation, + 0. 49.

One group (N= 7) underwent no countermeasure while the other (N= 8) received a daily, one hour, dose (2. 5 gz at the foot, decreasing to 1. 0 gz at the heart) of AG training on the Johnson Space Center short radius centrifuge. Cardiovascular parameters measured included heart rate, blood pressure, stroke volume, cardiac <b>output,</b> <b>peripheral</b> vascular resistance, plasma volume shifts, and vasoactive hormones. Untrained subjects exhibited shorter tilt survival (on average 8 minutes shorter) compared to trained subjects. By the end of bed rest, mean heart rate (MHR) was elevated in both groups (both supine and during tilt). In addition, treated subjects demonstrated lower, tilt-induced, increases in MHR four days following HDBR, indicating a more rapid return to pre bed rest conditions. Results from an index of autonomic balance (percentage of MHR spectral power in the respiratory frequency range) in control of heart rate are consistent with the interpretation that parasympathetic nervous system withdrawal was responsible for both tilt- and bed rest-induced increases in MHR. Our data support our pre-study hypothesis that AG treatment would lessen cardiovascular effects of deconditioning in bed rested men and suggest that AG should be further pursued as a space flight countermeasure...|$|E

Compared to pentobarbital, ether increases myocardial, cerebral, and carcass blood flow, while decreasing renal, splanchnic and cutaneous blood flow.

There are 3 common β 2 AR polymorphisms characterized in more detail for their influence on functional receptor activity.
