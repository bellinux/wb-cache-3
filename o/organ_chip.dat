Use of the mechanical actuation functionalities of this technology revealed a previously unknown sensitivity of lung cancer cell growth, invasion, and TKI therapeutic responses to physical cues associated with breathing motions, which appear to be mediated by changes in signaling through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MET protein kinase. These findings might help to explain the high level of resistance to therapy in cancer patients with minimal residual disease in regions of the lung that remain functionally aerated and mobile, in addition to providing an experimental model to study cancer persister cells and mechanisms of tumor dormancy in vitro...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMicrophysiological systems (organs-on-chips, tissue chips) are devices {{designed}} to recapitulate human physiology {{that could be}} used to better understand drug responses not easily addressed using other in vivo systems or in vitro animal models. Although still in development, initial results seem promising as tissue chips exhibit in vivo systems-like functional responses. The National Center for Advancing Translation Science (NCATS) identifies this technology as a potential tool that could improve the process of getting safer, more effective treatments to patients, and has led to the Tissue Chip Program, which aims to develop, integrate and validate major organ systems for testing. In addition to <b>organ</b> <b>chip</b> development, NCATS emphasizes disseminating the technology to researchers. Commercialization has become an important issue, reflecting the difficulty of translation from discovery to adoption and wide availability. Therefore, NCATS issued a Request for Information (RFI) targeted to existing partnerships for commercializing tissue chips. The goal was to identify successes, failures and the best practices that could provide useful guidance for future partnerships aiming to make tissue chip technology widely available...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years the need of new {{alternatives}} to traditional disease modelling, drug screening and toxicity tests has boosted {{the development of a new}} class of devices called <b>Organ</b> on <b>Chip.</b> These usually consist in a substrate or a well in which cells are cultured with the aim of differentiating them in a particular tissue lineage. With sensors and actuators integrated in the device, a culturing environment, as close as possible to in vivo one, is reproduced. This stimulates both cell differentiation and viability, boosting model reliability in this way. An instance of this class of devices is the Heart on Chip developed by Philips Research in collaboration with TU Delft. This device, also know as Cytostretch device, is a stretchable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane embedding a micro-electrode array meant to mea- sure the electrical activity of cardiomyocytes grown on the top of the membrane. Unlike most of previous organ-on-chip designs, the Cytostretch device was developed aiming at fabricating a clean-room compatible product. This should guarantee a large-scale fabrication and a rapid commercialization. Besides this, Philips Research team focused on the mechanical properties of the membrane by opting for a polymer-last approach. These design choices led to the fabrication of multi-electrode array characterized by an electrode-electrolyte impedance too high for the detection of the low-amplitude biopotential signals coming from the cells. In order to solve this problem, the integration of carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes into the Cytostretch device will be considered; CNT forests have been widely used to coat biopo- tential electrodes since they guarantee intrinsically large surface area as well as low electrode- electrolyte impedance. To the best of authors knowledge, this is the first attempt to embed CNT electrodes in an <b>Organ</b> on <b>Chip.</b> Moreover, this is the first work which aims to produce a CNT multiple electrode array with a large-scale fabrication, a fully clean-room compatible process and a polymer-last approach. This project had three main goals. Firstly, it aimed to characterize Cobalt-grown CNTs as bio-electrode coating. Secondly, it verified the feasibility of a novel fabrication process which allows to embed CNT electrodes in a PDMS membrane without the need to perform critical manual steps and last but not least, it aimed to prove the biocompatibility of CNTs as bio-electrode coating in in vitro tests including human induced pluripotential stem cells.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{applicability}} of numerical descriptors and statistical physics concepts to characterize complex biological systems observed at microscopic level through <b>organ</b> on <b>chip</b> approach. To this end, we employ data collected on a micro uidic platform in which leukocytes can move through suitably built channels toward their target. Leukocyte behavior is recorded by standard time lapse imaging. In particular, we analyze three groups of human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) : heterozygous mutants (in which only one copy of the FPR 1 gene is normal), homozygous mutants (in which both alleles encoding FPR 1 are loss-of-function variants) and cells from ‘wild type’ donors (with normal expression of FPR 1). We characterize the migration of these cells providing a quantitative con rmation of the essential role of FPR 1 in cancer chemotherapy response. Indeed wild type PBMC perform biased random walks toward chemotherapy-treated cancer cells establishing persistent interactions with them. Conversely, heterozygous mutants present a weaker bias in their motion and homozygous mutants perform rather uncorrelated random walks, both failing to engage with their targets. We next focus on wild type cells and study the interactions of leukocytes with cancerous cells developing a novel heuristic procedure, inspired by Lyapunov stability in dynamical systems...|$|R

However, introducing substrate surface textures often alters the ability to image cells with high precision, compromising our understanding of molecular mechanisms at stake in environmental sensing. In this paper, we demonstrate how nano/microstructured surfaces can be molded from an elastomeric material with a refractive index matched to the cell culture medium. Once made biocompatible, contrast imaging (differential interference contrast, phase contrast) and high-resolution fluorescence imaging of subcellular structures can be implemented through the textured surface using an inverted microscope. Simultaneous traction force measurements by micropost deflection were also performed, demonstrating the potential of our approach to study cell-environment interactions, sensing processes and cellular force generation with unprecedented resolution...|$|R

While <b>chips</b> fea-turing single <b>organs</b> can be of great use for both pharmaceutical testing and basic organ-level studies, the huge potential of the organ-on-a-chip technology is revealed by connect-ing multiple <b>organs</b> on one <b>chip</b> to create a single integrated system for sophisticated funda-mental biological studies and devising therapies for disease.

40|$|<b>Organs</b> on <b>chips</b> are a novel set {{of devices}} whose {{aim is to}} mimic {{cellular}} in-vivo conditions of the human physiology within a microchip. The need of reliable disease models, particularly {{for the development of}} pharmaceutical drugs, has drawn increased attention as the current widespread models; static cell cultures and animal tests, have proven poor predictability, are costly and are increasingly ethically problematic. By providing physiologically relevant bio-chemical, mechanical and other relevant cues to the cells cultured, these in-vitro 'organs' develop similar characteristics to those observed in their in-vivo counterparts. To achieve this, these chips are carefully designed and fabricated with various micro-fabrication technologies, in particular soft-lithography, due to its extensive use for microfluidic devices and materials' proven biological compatibility. However, standard soft-lithography presents major drawbacks as a platform for mass-scale fabrication of complex devices, in particular the extensive use of manual processing which makes it un-reliable and promotes break of thin substrates. At the Eindhoven University of Technology, an Organ-on-chip is being developed to study cancer cell dissemination; cancer metastasis, and several design features have been identified. In particular, the need of a thin micro-porous substrate that allows multiple-cells to be cultured in close contact, bio-chemical and mechanical stimuli, and migration of cells through this layer. Though several soft-lithographic techniques have been reported for the fabrication of similar thin porous films, the manual handling problem has been assessed to be the major technical bottle-neck. In this thesis, a fabrication method based on soft-lithography was designed to make thin micro-porous elastomeric membranes and a brief evaluation of their characteristics to be used for a Cancer-on-Chip was done. By integrating a selective sacrificial layer approach in the soft-lithographic molding process of the membrane, we have addressed the manual handling problem. This enabled us to fabricate large area thin PDMS membranes with micro-pores of 7 to 10 micrometer diameter. The membranes were successfully integrated in micro-fluidic devices and tested for reliability, robustness and porosity by mass transport experiments. Validation for its compatibility for cancer cell culturing was done by seeding breast cancer cells and observing their adhesion on and migration through the membrane.

40|$|The {{development}} of new microscale technologies aimed at generating human tissues and <b>organs</b> on a <b>chip</b> is emerging as a novel effective strategy to perform cost effective and multi-parametric assays for disease modeling investigations and screening specific therapeutic strategies, as broadly recognized from the scientific community, the major pharmaceutical companies and the governmental agencies. The generation of human <b>organs</b> on a <b>chip,</b> in which microscale technologies, such as microfluidics, are combined with cultured human cells in order to mimic whole living organ environment, offers {{a unique opportunity to}} study human physiology and pathophysiology, resembling in vivo conditions. This technological perspective could provide an effective solution to the current limitations of animal models, which result highly expensive and non predictive of human physiology, and conventional cell culture models that fail to recapitulate complex, organ-level disease processes. The possibility of developing direct organogenesis on a chip from human pluripotent stem cells, which have the potential to generate all cellular types of the human body, could overcome the limited availability of human primary cells, such as human hepatocytes or cardiomyocytes. Moreover, the recent generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from adult somatic cells through the ectopic expression of defined transcription factors, provides a new effective tool to obtain populations of patient-specific stem cells with distinctive genetic diversity. This work is aimed at the {{development of}} functional human tissues on a chip from pluripotent stem cells, to be used in developing new in vitro disease models or drug screening and toxicity assays, more predictive than current animal models, overcoming issues related to primary cell sources recruitment. To this purpose, an integrated microscale system, based on the microfluidic technology, was developed, in order to derive functional cardiac and hepatic tissues on a chip, from human pluripotent stem cells, through the accurate delivery of chemical compounds and growth factors, within cellular microenvironment, and proper regulation of exogenous and endogenous factors, which are known to affect embryonic development in vivo. These functionally differentiated cells on a chip can be directly used for multi-parametric and large-scale drug screening or for developing micro-engineered human organ models. This last aspect also requires to design new technology for assisting in vitro assays and developing new therapeutic strategies or for screening among potential clinical cures. In particular, design of proper functional assays to test cellular responses to drugs or external stimuli, such as mechanical stress or hypoxia, in a physiologic or pathologic context has been addressed. Thanks {{to the development of a}} microfluidic gas exchanger for generating rapid depletion of oxygen content in culture medium, the role of acute hypoxia in calcium handling machinery of a cardiomyocytes population was investigated, mimicking early effects of ischemia on cardiac microenvironment. Moreover, the role of cyclic mechanical stress, which plays a crucial role in the investigation of new physiological and pathological responses to cell culture microenvironment, was analyzed in a human Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in vitro model, through a microfluidic-based cell stretching device accurately reproducing cyclic mechanical deformations along time. The combination of tissues development on a chip and micro-technology assisting for functional assay on a chip opens new and substantial perespective in generating a human in vitro model that properly resemble the physiological and pathophysiological behaviro of a tissues or organs within humna body. ...|$|R
40|$|Upon {{examining}} current {{methods for}} printing and patterning of live biological cells, {{there is a}} need for a method capable of printing with the resolution of single biological cells to organize them into complex structures. In order to fill this need, building upon previous design of a dynamic lithography system, a stop flow lithography system was implemented capable of patterning individual particles with a mean accuracy of 11. 92 [mu]m and a standard deviation of 4. 63 [mu]m. This was achieved by improving the tracking capability of the software by measuring the exposure vs velocity relationship to anchor the particle as well as implementing a stop flow lithography based software approach. With the goal of producing 3 D functionalized tissue, a 3 D printing module was constructed for the dynamic lithography system that constructed microscale parts with a minimum layer height 16. 42 [mu]m of and planar resolution of 10 [mu]m, comparable to the top available micro-scale 3 D printers. To push the capability of the system, I analyzed and presented the limitations of the process via an opto-thermal model, and a computational fluid dynamics model which is then studied through a previously developed throughput analysis to get a theoretical maximum output of the system. In analyzing the limitations of the printing process, maximum input optical system power was characterized, and a theoretical maximum system throughput of 10, 000 particles per second was calculated.

Conventional methods of using lab mice for cancer behavior have limitations due to observation complications. Fabricating an artificial human tissue which can behave similar to a human body tissue consists of components, such as Laminin and Collagen. Collagen in human tissue has elements, such as integrin and serum. Creating serum based proteins are somewhat challenging due to the conditional requirements.

Purifications were mainly done by chemical methods that can cause human health concerns. The analytically demonstrated method in this thesis using bio-compatible hydrogel will address a new dimension to the water conservation method without causing health issues and eliminating the environmental pollution due to complicated degradable structures. Filtration and efficiency are among the main concerns of using bacteria types such as AOB/NOB directly without encapsulating. Application of using bio-compatible hydrogel based dual encapsulated single pallet structure described in this thesis will address the issue of filtering capability. Pallets can be removed once nitrified, without letting it grow inside the water contaminating aqua based living breads and plants. The process will improve the efficiency of Ammonia removal due to encapsulation. Drug delivery using micro locomotives in neuro-surgery has become one of the future concerns with the development of science. Conventional delivery systems such as vaccines and open surgeries take longer response time once surgeries become more complex.

Nematodes become useful in the future of microsurgeries, as many biologists are focusing on using their healthy nerves to implant in humans. Therefore, such applications like magnetizing nematodes help move locomotives to targeted locations and capture scan images for future medical approaches...|$|R
