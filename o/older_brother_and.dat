5|$|Much {{the most}} {{prominent}} decoration on the cup is the cycle of scenes {{from the life of}} Saint Agnes, which is rarely depicted in such detail in art. However, there was one outstanding devotee of the saint in the period: King CharlesV of France, Berry's <b>older</b> <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> Charles VI's father. CharlesV was born in 1338 on Saint Agnes' feast day, January 21, and is recorded as owning at least 13 works of art featuring her, including a different gold cup enamelled with scenes from her life (both are recorded in the 1391 inventory). Until recent decades the generally accepted hypothesis was that Berry ordered the cup as a present for his brother in 1380, to be ready for his birthday in January 1381. When the king died in September 1380, Berry had retained it for a decade before presenting it to CharlesVI.|$|E

5|$|By {{the ninth}} century the many kingdoms {{of the early}} Anglo-Saxon period had been {{consolidated}} into four: Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria and East Anglia. In the eighth century, Mercia {{had been the most}} powerful kingdom in southern England, but in the early ninth, Wessex became dominant under Æthelstan's great-great-grandfather, Egbert. In the middle of the century, England came under increasing attack from Viking raids, culminating in invasion by the Great Heathen Army in 865. By 878, the Vikings had overrun East Anglia, Northumbria, and Mercia, and nearly conquered Wessex. The West Saxons fought back under Alfred the Great, and achieved a decisive victory at the Battle of Edington. Alfred and the Viking leader Guthrum agreed on a division that gave Alfred western Mercia, while eastern Mercia was incorporated into Viking East Anglia. In the 890s, renewed Viking attacks were successfully fought off by Alfred, assisted by his son (and Æthelstan's father) Edward and Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians. Æthelred ruled English Mercia under Alfred and was married to his daughter Æthelflæd. Alfred died in 899 and was succeeded by Edward. Æthelwold, the son of Æthelred, King Alfred's <b>older</b> <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> predecessor as king, made a bid for power, but was killed at the Battle of the Holme in 902.|$|E
