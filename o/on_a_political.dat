5|$|John Jeremy Thorpe {{was born}} in 1929, the son and {{grandson}} of Conservative MPs. After school at Eton, he studied law at Trinity College, Oxford, where, having decided <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> career, he devoted his main energies to making a personal impact rather than to his studies. Rejecting his Conservative background, he joined the small, centrist Liberal Party, by the late 1940s a declining force in British politics but still offering a national platform and a challenge to an ambitious young politician. He became secretary, and eventually president, of the university's Liberal Club, and met many of the party's leading figures. In the Hilary term (January–March) of 1950–51 Thorpe {{served as president of}} the Oxford Union.|$|E

Speer also made plans to reconstruct Berlin on a grand scale, with huge buildings, wide boulevards, and a reorganized transportation system.|$|E
5|$|Wong {{stated that}} most people take for granted what they possess, and may be without {{identity}} or culture. Wong says his self-awareness, and what Hong Kong represents to him, stem from the years he spent abroad. He says that only by living amidst a second culture can one fully come to realise what one represents and where one belongs. A thread that runs through much of his work is therefore the notion of home, homelessness and wandering. Since 2011, his repertoire has taken <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> dimension.|$|E

5|$|Adam Gopnik was {{selected}} to deliver the 2011 Massey Lectures, the annual week-long series of lectures <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>political,</b> cultural or philosophical topic given in Canada by a noted scholar. Gopnik was chosen by the panel of representatives from Massey College, House of Anansi Press and the CBC, the organizations responsible for coordinating the lectures. This would be the 50th anniversary of the Massey Lectures and coincide with the 75th anniversary of the CBC. Ideas executive producer Bernie Lucht contacted Gopnik by email to inform him of the panel's decision and {{to ask if he}} would accept. At the time Gopnik was living in New York City, working as a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. He had previously authored several books on different topics, the most successful being Paris to the Moon, a collection of essays published in 2000. Gopnik read Lucht's email while waiting for a bus on Madison Avenue. Gopnik later stated {{that by the end of}} the 20-minute bus ride he had already selected a topic and had a good idea of the issues he would address.|$|E
5|$|Like his father, Adams {{embarked}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> {{career with}} the support of the Boston Caucus. He was elected to his first political office in 1747, serving as one of the clerks of the Boston market. In 1756, the Boston Town Meeting elected him to the post of tax collector, which provided a small income. He often failed to collect taxes from his fellow citizens, which increased his popularity among those who did not pay, but left him liable for the shortage. By 1765, his account was more than £8,000 in arrears. The town meeting was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Adams was compelled to file suit against delinquent taxpayers, but many taxes went uncollected. In 1768, his political opponents used the situation to their advantage, obtaining a court judgment of £1,463 against him. Adams's friends paid off some of the deficit, and the town meeting wrote off the remainder. By then, he had emerged as a leader of the popular party, and the embarrassing situation did not lessen his influence.|$|E
