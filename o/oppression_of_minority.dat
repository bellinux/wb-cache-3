The tests have also been found to be culturally biased, therefore, language and experience differences affects test outcomes with lower-class and minority children consistently having lower scores. This leads to inaccurate judgements of students' abilities.|$|E

50|$|Kevin Kumashiro is {{a strong}} proponent for {{publicly}} funded education and his advocacy stems from empowering minority groups such as LGBTQ, low SES, and ethnic students to have an equal opportunity to become well educated citizens. Kumashiro claims {{that many of the}} learning problems that come from public education arise from racial unawareness {{on the part of the}} educators. This discrimination can be unintentional as well as intentional. On top of that Kumashiro criticizes that public schools are perpetuating oppressive teaching practices by failing to acknowledge them. He believes that the best way to prevent <b>oppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> groups is for educators and educational leaders to ask “How our practices contribute to oppression?” Alongside fellow educators, Kevin Kumashiro criticizes public leaders who develop public school curriculum for failing to realize their unintentional discriminative lessons. In his book, “Preparing Anti-Oppressive Teachers in 6 Disciplines”, Kevin Kumashiro dispels the notion that anti-oppressive teaching is limited to social studies such as politics and history.|$|E

On the basis of close textual analysis, we argue that a discursive framing of SSA {{as a form of}} cultural <b>oppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> women in need of protection underpinned Bruce’s Bill; in contrast, by highlighting issues more commonly articulated in defence of women’s abortion rights, the second set of debates displaced this framing in favour of a broader understanding, drawing on post-colonial feminist critiques, of how socio-economic factors constrain all women in this regard. We argue that the problematisation of SSA explains the original cross-party support for, and subsequent defeat of, the policies proposed to restrict SSA. Our analysis also highlights the central role of ideology in the policy process, thus making politics visible in policy-making...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the {{literature}} on diversity training and examine the effect of power, privilege and politics on diversity in organisations. Design/methodology/approach – This is a conceptual paper examining the arguments in favour and against diversity training in organisations.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the ownership and governance {{of the business}} corporations of New York State in the 1820 s. Using a new dataset collected from the manuscript records of New York's 1823 capital tax, and from the charters of the corporations, I analyze the ownership structures of the firms, and investigate {{the degree to which}} ownership was separated from control at the time. In contrast to Berle and Means's account of the development of the corporation, the results indicate that many of the firms were dominated by large shareholders, who were represented on the firms' boards, and held sweeping power to utilize the firms' resources for their own benefit. The <b>oppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> shareholders was a significant problem in early corporate governance, and many of the firms configured their voting rights in a way that curtailed the power of large investors. A positive relationship between firm value and these voting rights configurations is found among the publicly-traded firms in the sample. ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A., English (Literature)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Constructing {{a system}} of {{economic}} and social power based upon the performance of certain characteristics classified as white, a dominant white group (those who adequately perform the particular characteristics of whiteness) powerfully exerts not only an external control, but also a pivotal internal oppression over groups classified as non-white (i. e. minorities), This internal <b>oppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> groups {{comes in the form of}} a sociological process called internalization. Through internalization, minority individuals often choose to reject many alternatives to the white system???such as solidarity with other minority groups???and, instead may actually perpetuate the system by imitating its exploitive practices. Within this paper, I explore representations of internalization of white supremacy, as I analyze two novels, John Okada???s No- No Boy (1957) and Chester Himes??? If He Hollers Let Him Go (1945). By pointing out this process of internalizing white supremacy, both Okada and Himes do not merely intend to highlight a depressing and hopeless phenomenon. Instead, both authors offer their readers a warning against the dangers of allowing a racist system of economic power to continue. In addition, both writers also articulate a solution for countering white economic exploitation. That is, Himes and Okada ultimately encourage acting upon the creative alternatives of cooperation and solidarity that minority individuals in each novel formulate. English (Literature...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} closed access. The {{continued}} decline {{in levels of}} political engagement among British citizens has led many politicians, commentators and academics from {{across the political spectrum}} to advocate a move toward a more direct form of democracy via some kind of localism. The claim is that citizens feel increasingly estranged from the democratic process, and from those organisations on which they have historically relied to represent them within the political system. Consequently, localists argue, there now exists a gap between the people, the institutions which are supposed to work on their behalf, and the decisions made in their name, so the system needs to be reformed {{in such a way as}} to give individuals and local communities more of a direct input into the decision-making process. Calls for a more direct form of democracy via localism are popular among members of the progressive left and the ‘new Conservative’ right, and have become so dominant in political discourse that it is often suggested that ‘we are all localists now’. This article raises questions about the localist agenda, and suggests that the adoption of a more direct form of democracy in Britain may not only fail to address the decline in political engagement, but may also result in the exclusion, marginalisation, and <b>oppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> groups...|$|E
40|$|The new {{genetics}} {{has brought}} forth concerns that such developments as screening for genetic diseases will accentuate the <b>oppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> ethnic groups [Bradby (1996) Genetics and racism. In The Troubled Helix: {{social and psychological}} aspects of the new human genetics, ed. T. Marteau and M. Richards, pp. 295 - 316. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge]. Haemoglobin disorders primarily affect minority {{ethnic groups in the}} U. K. but {{have been the subject of}} protest regarding lack of services as much as the unwelcome advent of them. This paper examines various conceptions of "race", from biological reductionism, through notions of ethnicity, racialized groups, sociological conceptions of "race", political and analytical uses of the term "Black" and so-called "new ethnicities" such as situational and plastic ethnicity in order to examine the consequences of these competing conceptions of race for a social analysis of sickle cell anaemia and beta-thalassaemia. The paper concludes that any group of people associated with the haemoglobin disorders are subject both to constraints upon their actions and opportunities for re-interpreting their social world. In conclusion it is proposed that no nomenclature classifies the phenomenon unproblematically. The notion of race as a political construct [Goldberg (1993) Racist Culture: Philosophy and the Politics of Meaning. Blackwell, Oxford] is used to suggest that attempts to construct all-embracing definitions themselves signal the potential abuses which may be attendant upon programmatic or mechanistic conceptions of the relationship between race and haemoglobin disorders. ...|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to examine whether blogs can foster political mobilization among minority populations, using the minority Indians in Malaysia as the context. In particular, this research studies the characteristics of blogs from a non-Western perspective as a network structure, suitable for communication and coordination to organize collective action and political mobilization. Concepts: This study builds a theoretical framework showing the relationship between space for activism and collective actors in pursuit of political mobilization. Concepts relating to the public sphere, civil society, collective identity and resistance identity are explored. Methodology: Research was primarily qualitative and based on two case studies: i) the Hindu Rights Action Force (Hindraf) protest rally on November 25, 2007, and ii) the defeat of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) party in the 2008 Malaysian general elections. The analysis based on chronological narratives was multidimensional; data collected were from three broad sources, i) documentation and archival records from blogs, ii) individual and focus group interviews, and iii) direct observations. Analysis: The Hindraf rally occurred {{in the wake of the}} systematic political and cultural <b>oppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> Indians, resulting in a resistance movement and culminating in the protest. The rally was instrumental in the defeat of the MIC in the 12 th general election. Conclusion: The findings show that blogs can foster political mobilization among ethnic minority Indians in Malaysia. Key themes that emerged from examining the case studies in the context of minority politics in Malaysia are the importance of i) context, ii) collective identity, iii) links between traditional and new media, iv) access to the Internet, v) politics of credibility and identification, and vi) politics of representation. Contributions: This research is the first to examine the relationship between blogs, minority population and political mobilization in Malaysia.

40|$|The {{protection}} of minority shareholders {{is one of}} the important topics in company law. The two major <b>oppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> shareholders are from the management and the majority shareholders. In this thesis, I seek to study the two oppression and the minority protection under the company law in Hong Kong and China. This thesis discusses: (i) Whether the Hong Kong common law system provides better protection to minority shareholders than is found in the Chinese civil law system? (ii) Whether the high degree of concentrated corporate ownership leads to the poor {{protection of}} minority shareholders in Hong Kong and China? (iii) What are the transplantation effects of foreign company laws on the protection of minority shareholders in Hong Kong and China? (iv) Whether the existing legal remedies to minority shareholders in Hong Kong and China are adequate? and (v) What are the problems of minority shareholders protection in Hong Kong and China? A comparative study of corporate governance and the protection of minority shareholders in Hong Kong and China is to identify the similarities and differences in the two systems for the purposes of legal reform. This thesis argues that mere adoption of Hong Kong common law system according to the legal origin theory could not improve corporate governance and minority shareholders protection in China; Chinese corporate governance and minority shareholders protection reform must include both legislative and structural aspects and these aspects are shaped by the initial paths according to the path dependence theory. This thesis argues that the high concentration of corporate ownership does not necessarily lead to poor legal protection of shareholders in Hong Kong, and the weak protection of minority shareholders in China is not due to its civil law origin but its structures relating {{to the rule of law}} principle. This thesis examines the theoretical debates between the legal origin theory and the path dependence theory and applies them to Hong Kong and China. This thesis contends that the basic company law has already achieved a high degree of uniformity in Hong Kong and China and the base of divergence between Hong Kong and China is in the structural and institutional differences. This thesis argues that the success of legal transplantation and minority protection in Hong Kong is dependent upon its initial structures which have been locked-in to the current structures. This thesis concludes that the issues of minority shareholders protection in China are in its socialist market economy, state intervening policy, public ownership, relation-based tradition, rule by law culture, corruption practices, dominant role of the CCP and non-independent judiciary; and the Chinese minority protection reform, in a broader sense, involves not only the legislative issue but also the structural issues which relate to the rule of law principle. This thesis proposes that the transplantation of foreign company law will not necessarily improve the protection of minority shareholders and hence the corporate governance in China. This thesis also confirms that direct transplantation of foreign law is not always suitable for countries with less developed structures. These findings are also relevant to other emerging economies and developing countries in understanding the limitations on the use of foreign law to improve corporate governance and the protection of minority shareholders. ...|$|E

Barry Commoner argued that the Ehrlichs were too focused on overpopulation as the source of environmental problems, and that their proposed solutions were politically unacceptable because of the coercion that they implied, and because the cost would fall disproportionately on the poor. He argued that technological, and above all social development would lead to a natural decrease in both population growth and environmental damage.|$|R
