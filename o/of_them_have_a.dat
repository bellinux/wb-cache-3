5|$|The Tycho impact, which {{occurred}} between 15–20 and 70–95 million years ago, formed secondary crater clusters in various {{locations of the}} Moon. Data from the examination of these clusters suggest that the central crater cluster in the valley formed {{as a result of}} said impact. Upon analysis of known secondary impact clusters resulting from the Tycho impact, it has been discovered that the majority <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> downrange ejecta blanket, or debris layer, with a distinctive 'birdsfoot' pattern. Apollo 17 observation data and comparison between the valley's central crater cluster and known Tycho secondary impacts shows many similarities between the two. The central crater cluster has a birdsfoot ejecta pattern that points in the direction of Tycho and the debris pattern of the light mantle points directly towards the South massif. The latter piece of evidence further supports the hypothesis that the light mantle formed {{as a result of an}} avalanche occurring on the aforementioned massif because of secondary Tycho impacts. Large-scale analysis suggests that the crater cluster may be part of a larger secondary cluster of Tycho, including craters on the North massif and other clusters as far north as Littrow crater. If indeed related, the smaller clusters form a large cluster that could be part of a nearby ray of Tycho.|$|E

After he finds out who raped John Paul several months ago, the two <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fight and he drunkenly sleeps with Sinead. He's supportive to John Paul about his trial but he keeps taking drugs. After he discovers Tegan has a cancer, he gets high yet again in front of Amy and the kids. He then has a one-night stand with a man, he doesn't remember. By his and Lockie's fault, John Paul is sent to hospital because of the drugs. He decides to go to rehab. After that, he faces his abusive stepfather Terry and later proposes to John Paul, who accepts. They have a Christmas wedding, that is ruined when Sinead says she's expecting Ste's child. John Paul eventually forgives Ste and agrees to look after their baby with them. Ste then gets the devastating news that he's HIV positive, but John Paul sticks by his side. He is bothered with his friendship with Sinead and thinks they could be romantically involved, which Ste denies. Sinead {{falls in love with}} Ste and she wants to separate Ste and John Paul. She finds out John Paul kissed his student, Harry, Tony's son, unknowingly after one of their fights, and tries to frame him but Ste gets attacted in a hate crime. John Paul and Ste later split up and Sinead gives birth to their daughter, Hannah. Ste lives with them but is shocked when he overhears that Sinead loves him. After her heated words, he uses drugs again, but later pleads Sinead to not leave him and give them a chance as a couple, which confuses everyone. Ste than starts seeing Harry, even though he doesn't want to hurt Sinead. When she discovers, she leaves along with Hannah, which devastates Ste. He starts to date Harry behind Tony's back, but he is eventually found out. They later start dating for real but Ste breaks up with him as he thinks he's too young to be with someone like him. They later get back together but after Harry thinks he broke his promise not to take drugs and wants to end it with him, Ste accepts John Paul's offer to meet up and try again, but then when he sees Harry, John Paul understands he doesn't want him and Ste will end up with Harry. They live with Ste's sisters but Cameron, the man Leela had Peri with, doesn't want him with them and with false accusations, they both leave and become homeless. Later, when Ste is determinated to deal drugs again, Harry sleeps with another man for money. When Ste finds out the truth, they break up and Cameron gives him crystal meth. Ste becomes addicted and even when he and Harry get back together, he can't stop. When Harry finds out, he and Tony try to help him and get him into rehab.|$|E

25|$|Anti-metabolites are a {{group of}} {{molecules}} that impede DNA and RNA synthesis. Many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> similar structure to {{the building blocks of}} DNA and RNA. The building blocks are nucleotides; a molecule comprising a nucleobase, a sugar and a phosphate group. The nucleobases are divided into purines (guanine and adenine) and pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine and uracil). Anti-metabolites resemble either nucleobases or nucleosides (a nucleotide without the phosphate group), but have altered chemical groups. These drugs exert their effect by either blocking the enzymes required for DNA synthesis or becoming incorporated into DNA or RNA. By inhibiting the enzymes involved in DNA synthesis, they prevent mitosis because the DNA cannot duplicate itself. Also, after misincorporation of the molecules into DNA, DNA damage can occur and programmed cell death (apoptosis) is induced. Unlike alkylating agents, anti-metabolites are cell cycle dependent. This means that they only work during a specific part of the cell cycle, in this case S-phase (the DNA synthesis phase). For this reason, at a certain dose, the effect plateaus and proportionally no more cell death occurs with increased doses. Subtypes of the anti-metabolites are the anti-folates, fluoropyrimidines, deoxynucleoside analogues and thiopurines.|$|E

25|$|As for irrational numbers, none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> finite {{representation}} {{in any of}} the rational-based positional number systems (such as the decimal and duodecimal ones); this is because a rational-based positional number system is essentially nothing but a way of expressing quantities as a sum of fractions whose denominators are powers of the base, and by definition no finite sum of rational numbers can ever result in an irrational number. For example, 123.456 = 1 × 102 + 2 × 101 + 3 × 100 + 4 × 1/101 + 5 × 1/102 + 6 × 1/103 (this is also the reason why fractions that contain prime factors in their denominator not in common with those of the base do not have a terminating {{representation in}} that base). Moreover, the infinite series of digits of an irrational number does not exhibit a strictly repeating pattern; instead, the different digits often succeed in a seemingly random fashion. The following chart compares the first few digits of the decimal and duodecimal representation of several of the most important algebraic and transcendental irrational numbers. Some of these numbers may be perceived as having fortuitous patterns, making them easier to memorize, when represented in one base or the other.|$|E
