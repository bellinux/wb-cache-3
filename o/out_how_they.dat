5|$|At Sandia Base, three Army officers, Captains Albert Bethel, Richard Meyer, and Bobbie Griffin {{attempted}} {{to re-create the}} Little Boy. They were supervised by Harlow W. Russ, an expert on Little Boy who served with Project Alberta on Tinian, and was now leader of the Z-11 Group of the Los Alamos Laboratory's Z Division at Sandia. Gradually, they managed to locate the correct drawings and parts, and figured <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> went together. Eventually, they built six Little Boy assemblies. Although the casings, barrels, and components were tested, no enriched uranium was supplied for the bombs. By early 1947, the problem caused by the Wigner effect {{was on its way}} to solution, and the three officers were reassigned.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, prokaryotes were {{regarded}} as a single group of organisms and classified based on their biochemistry, morphology and metabolism. For example, microbiologists tried to classify microorganisms based on the structures of their cell walls, their shapes, and the substances they consume. In 1965, Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling proposed instead using the sequences of the genes in different prokaryotes to work <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> are related to each other. This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the main method used today.|$|E
25|$|Leviathan and its {{subsequent}} sequels stand out notably to other young adult novels that are published {{in recent years}} for featuring illustrations in-between its pages. The idea of incorporating illustrations into them began back in 2007 when author Westerfeld had discovered illustrations for the Japanese translation of his earlier work Uglies, {{to which he had}} shared them on his blog. He was met with feedback from English-speaking fans who complained of how their novels were lacking in such features; until one reader pointed <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> are a norm in Japanese novels, particularly light novels. Further research by Westerfeld also found it to be a commonality in old Western novels prior to the invention of the camera. Inspiration also came from adventure novels that were around during the World War I era, which became one basis of research for the series' settings.|$|E

Unable to make the album sound like what was typical of other records {{released}} in the late 1970s, as well as finding it boring, Horn [...] "figured that if I couldn't get records to sound like Elton John, which I couldn't because I couldn't figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> did it, then whatever I could do, I'd better exaggerate it." [...] He had also wanted to [...] "perverse things with sound, except that in 1978 and 1979, none of the equipment which would later allow {{me to do that}} was available. So I had to pre-date that technology by finding my own ways of achieving certain sounds." [...] Audio noted the album's sound to be reminiscent of duo Godley & Creme's debut album Consequences.|$|E
500|$|Molina {{is known}} for his in-game pitch-calling skills, and {{pitchers}} rarely reject signs that he shows for the next pitch. [...] Matheny stated, [...] "We tell all our young pitchers when they come up to pitch their game. [...] Yadi needs to find <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> work. [...] He's a quick study. [...] But at the same time, they tend to just follow him. [...] We do put them in Yadi's hands." [...] Molina reads opposing hitters and will move fielders with subtle signs and gestures to align them with his pitch calling. [...] La Russa commented that [...] "it's not just instinct. [...] It's sense, based on how a hitter's standing, how he responds to the pitch or two before, and he's very creative in how he makes his adjustment based on what he sees with the hitter and knowing what his pitcher can do." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{production}} meeting between U2 and their creative {{team for the}} Innocence + Experience Tour was held in March 2013. Although Songs of Innocence was still in progress {{at the time and}} did not yet have a title, the autobiographical narrative that would characterise the album was already a driving idea for their tour. The band wanted {{to tell the story of}} their adolescence in Dublin in the 1970s and how they were [...] "trying to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> fit into the often violent and disrupted world outside" [...] their homes. The manifesto for the tour was summarized by two phrases: [...] "I can't change the world, but I can change the world in me", and [...] "I can the change the world, but I can't change the world in me." [...] The first is a lyric from the band's 1981 song [...] "Rejoice" [...] and represents the mindset of a teenage Bono feeling powerless to make a difference in a world plagued by the Troubles, who instead views personal psychological changes as a possibility; the second phrase represents the modern-day realization that the same person could make a difference in the world through philanthropic efforts but still struggle with the complexities of internal change. Devlin said, [...] "The space between these two statements is the territory of the album and of the show." [...] The band intended to stage shows in pairs and alternate the setlist between [...] "innocence" [...] and [...] "experience" [...] motifs night to night. Williams said, [...] "The artfulness in this tour is in the ideas, not the hardware".|$|E
