25|$|In November 2014, the Australian {{state of}} Victoria {{modified}} its existing sexting laws. In addition to prohibiting the sending of nude pictures without consent, the amendment also added safeguards to prevent minors from receiving child pornography charges for self-made content. The legislation followed an upsurge {{in the practice}} and the case Giller v Procopets, {{which had to be}} argued on the equity of breach of confidence and tort grounds. South Australia followed in 2016, with a bill making it illegal to distribute or threaten to distribute invasive nude photographs. New South Wales passed a Bill that criminalised the distribution, or threatened distribution, <b>of</b> <b>intimate</b> photos or videos, which commenced on 25 August 2017.

25|$|The {{play was}} written in January 2006, {{initially}} with the title If I Were You, which was then altered to I to I before reverting to the original. However, there were no plans to produce the play that year, as the Stephen Joseph Theatre already planned to produce revivals <b>of</b> <b>Intimate</b> Exchanges and Woman in Mind. However, on 21 February 2006, Alan Ayckbourn suffered a stroke. As a result, directorship <b>of</b> <b>Intimate</b> Exchanges passed to Tim Luscombe, {{and the production of}} Woman in Mind was eventually dropped altogether. Whilst in hospital, Ayckbourn decided to use his latest play as a goal to work towards. I to I was scheduled for the autumn slot vacated by Woman in Mind in June, rehearsed at the rehearsal studio at his home, and the play was announced to the public, now retitled as If I Were You, in July.|$|E

25|$|Counseling {{may be used}} by {{offenders}} {{to minimize}} the risk of future domestic violence. Most commonly, to date, convicted or self-referring offenders undertake programmes for perpetrators <b>of</b> <b>intimate</b> partner violence. These are delivered in a group format, one or two hours per week, over a set time period. Programme facilitators guide participants through a curriculum of adult-education style modules, which draw on a variety of therapeutic approaches, but predominantly cognitive behavioural therapy and psycho-education. A debate on the effectiveness of these programmes is on-going. While some (ex-) partners of offenders have experienced improvements in their situation, others have not, and there also appears to be a risk of doing harm.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{rates of}} interracial {{cohabitation}} are {{significantly higher than}} those of marriage. Although only 7% of married African American men have European American wives, 12.5% of cohabitating African American men have European American partners. 25% of married Asian American women have European spouses, but 45% of cohabitating Asian American women are with European American men—higher than the percentage cohabiting with Asian men (less than 43%). Of cohabiting Asian men, slightly over 37% of Asian men have white female partners and over 10% married to white women. These numbers suggest that the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>intimate</b> interracial contact is around double that of what is represented by marriage data.|$|E
25|$|A {{marriage}} {{in which both}} spouses agree ahead of time to accept sexual relations by either partner with others is {{sometimes referred to as}} an open marriage or the swinging lifestyle. Polyamory, meaning the practice, desire, or acceptance <b>of</b> <b>intimate</b> relationships that are not exclusive with respect to other sexual or intimate relationships, with knowledge and consent of everyone involved, sometimes involves such marriages. Swinging and open marriages are both a form of non-monogamy, and the spouses would not view the sexual relations as objectionable. However, irrespective of the stated views of the partners, extra-marital relations could still be considered a crime in some legal jurisdictions which criminalize adultery.|$|E
