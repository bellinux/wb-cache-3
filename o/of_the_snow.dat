5|$|Because of {{the harsh}} winter conditions, the station area was {{gradually}} built with snow tunnels {{to keep the}} snow off the tracks. This included the platforms {{and most of the}} passing loop at the station. In 1914–15, the station serviced 398 passengers, and in 1919–20, it serviced 684 passengers, both times making it the least used station on the line. In 1948, the western part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> tunnel caught fire, and although it spread to the station building, it was quickly put out by the staff. In 1953, there was again a fire in the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Étretat, Monet {{completed}} three paintings of fishing boats, one of a rural road, and, sometime between late 1868 and January or February 1869, The Magpie (W 133).

5|$|Groomed trail skiing {{occurs at}} facilities, such as Nordmarka (Oslo), Royal Gorge Cross Country Ski Resort and Gatineau Park, Quebec, where trails {{are laid out}} and groomed for both classic and skate-skiing. Such {{grooming}} and track setting (for classic technique) requires specialized equipment and techniques that adapt to the condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow.</b> Trail preparation employs snow machines that tow snow compaction, texturing and track-setting devices. Groomers must adapt such equipment to {{the condition of the}} snow—crystal structure, temperature, degree of compaction, moisture content, etc. Depending on the initial condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow,</b> grooming may achieve an increase in density for new-fallen snow or a decrease in density for icy or compacted snow. Cross-country ski facilities may incorporate a course design that meets homologation standards for such organizations as the International Olympic Committee, the International Ski Federation or national standards. Standards address course distances, degree of difficulty with maximums in elevation difference and steepness—both up and downhill, plus other factors. Some facilities have night-time lighting on select trails—called lysløype (light trails) in Norwegian and elljusspår (electric light trails) in Swedish. The first lysløype were opened in 1946 in Nordmarka and at Byåsen (Trondheim).|$|E

5|$|In Eurasia, red foxes may be preyed upon by leopards, caracals and Eurasian lynxes. The lynxes chase red foxes {{into deep}} snow, where their longer legs and larger paws {{give them an}} {{advantage}} over foxes, especially when the depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> exceeds one metre. In the Velikoluki district in Russia, red foxes are absent or are seen only occasionally where lynxes establish permanent territories. Researchers consider lynxes to represent considerably less danger to red foxes than wolves do. North American felid predators of red foxes include cougars, Canadian lynxes and bobcats. Occasionally, large raptors such as Eurasian eagle owls will prey on young foxes, while golden eagles {{have been known to}} kill adults.|$|E

5|$|Ski wax {{enhances the}} ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.|$|E
5|$|The first {{motorised}} snowplows {{were developed}} in 1913, based on truck and tractor bodies. These machines allowed the mechanisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> clearing process, reducing the labor required for snow removal and increasing the speed and efficiency of the process. The expansion of the aviation industry also acted {{as a catalyst for}} the development of winter service vehicles during the early 20th century. Even a light dusting of snow or ice could cause an aeroplane to crash, so airports erected snow fences around airfields to prevent snowdrifts, and began to maintain fleets of vehicles to clear runways in heavy weather.|$|E

5|$|A snow sweeper uses brushes {{to remove}} thin layers of snow from the {{pavement}} surface. Snow sweepers are used after plowing {{to remove any}} remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and racing tracks, as the flexible brushes follow the terrain better than the rigid blades of snowplows and snow blowers. These brushes also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at traffic lights and tram stops, without damaging the delicate surface. Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow sweepers do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, high friction, surface behind them. This makes snow sweepers the most efficient method of snow removal for snow depths below 10centimetres (4in). Snow deeper than this however can clog the brushes, and most snow sweepers cannot be used to clear snow deeper than 15centimetres (6in). A more advanced version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the brushes, in order to blow the swept snow clear of the pavement and prevent the loosened snow from settling.|$|E
5|$|Because of its remote {{location}} and relative inaccessibility, climate records are poor. The nearest weather station, Potato Hill, {{has only been}} measuring precipitation since 1982 and temperatures since 1989. Temperature and precipitation records from Glenwood and Trout Lake, both considerably lower in elevation and farther from the mountain, are more complete and go back further, 1948 at Glenwood and 1924 at Trout Lake. Snowfall records from the three snow stations on Adams cover {{a number of years}} but are discontinuous and are limited to the northwest side. The Potato Hill station was monitored monthly from 1950-1976 and was replaced in 1982 with the automated precipitation sensor. It was upgraded in 1983 to report snow water equivalent and it was upgraded again in 2006 to report snow depth. The Council Pass station was monitored monthly from 1956-1978 and the Divide Meadow station was monitored monthly from 1962-1978. Divide Meadow was the most representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> depth {{on the west side of}} Adams because it was the highest station on the flanks of the mountain.|$|E
5|$|Dallas {{was born}} Constance Hopkins Snow on April 28, 1902, in Brooklyn Heights, New York, the {{daughter}} of Henry Sanger Snow and Anna LeConte Brooks. Henry Snow was a lawyer who worked as the treasurer of the New York & New Jersey Telephone Сompany. Brooks was originally from Philadelphia, {{the daughter of}} inventor David Brooks, and had {{served as president of}} the Daughters of the American Revolution. Constance was the youngest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snow</b> children, born when her mother was forty-seven years old. She had three older siblings: Marion, Edward, and Anna. After Henry Snow was indicted for grand larceny concerning his former employers in 1908, he fled the city, leaving his family destitute. With some financial assistance from Andrew Carnegie, a friend of David Brooks, the family moved to Europe, where accommodations were cheaper and the family could be free of the stigma of Henry's crimes. While there, Constance was educated in convent schools in Belgium. When the family returned to the United States, they settled in Philadelphia and Snow attended Germantown Friends School. She later studied nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, and she served in the Cadet Nurse Corps during World War II.|$|E

5|$|Due to its unusual nature, both heavy {{snowfall}} {{and strong}} winds caused {{a swath of}} devastation stretching from the Mid-Atlantic states to northern New England. In the Middle-Atlantic region, moderate damage occurred at sea but little was noted inland. In New England, strong gusts inflicted significant damage to numerous churches. Widespread residential damage, in contrast, was mostly negligible and had no lasting consequences. Thousands of trees were knocked over, obstructing roads and fiscally damaging the timber industry throughout the region. Cold temperatures, wet snow, and high winds downed numerous branches in fruit orchards, froze potato crops, flattened dozens of barns, and killed over a hundred cattle. In general, the agriculture, shipping, timber, and livestock trades suffered most acutely following the passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> hurricane, while structural damage was widespread but generally inconsequential.|$|E
5|$|In New Jersey, {{increasing}} winds caused blowing and drifting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> {{and led to}} near-blizzard conditions. Behind the storm, {{very cold}} and gusty weather lingered. New Jersey Transit shut down bus service in northern portions of the state, and rail lines had 20-minute delays. Most injuries in the state were related to physical strain while shoveling, snow blower accidents or slips and falls. As the snowfall was of a light nature, few trees limbs and electrical wires were downed by the storm. GPU Energy reported only around 5,500 power outages. A countywide state of emergency was declared in Sussex County, as vehicles were sliding off roadways. Several other traffic accidents and delays were reported throughout the state, and in Somerset County, a few roads were closed due to the snow. A Red Cross shelter was opened for residents of a Spotswood trailer park.|$|E
5|$|It {{also has}} a more {{extensive}} classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack {{and the formation of}} ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.|$|E

40|$|From <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> view of {{classical}} physical theory, the reflection, scattering and diffraction of waves from objects or media have been fully {{understood in the}} sense that the underlying differential equations and boundary conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relevant variables are known. It is simple, in principle, to solve these problems under the boundary conditions appiopriate to each, but, in practice this has proved to be a difficult problem even under simple and idealized conditions. Though variable methods to solve these problems strictl yor approximately and many results for them has been reported, many important and interesting subjects for practical use are remained. 　In this study, we investigate reflections of electromgnetic waves from the snow-covered land in order to give fundamental data for the radio wave communications using the ultra-high frequencies. 　In Chapter 1, we give a general analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reflection <b>of</b> plane electrnmagnetic waves from a parallel stratified medium consisting of two slabs one of which is an inhomoheneous and the other is a homogeneous. In most cases, the snow-covered land is represented by these slabs. 　In Chapter 2, <b>the</b> electromagnetic properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snows</b> and <b>the</b> land are considered carefully based on a number of experimental data. It is shown that there is a simple relation between <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> density and its permittivity (Cumming 2 ̆ 7 s relation), thus measuring <b>the</b> density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snows</b> we can get its permittivity. 　In Chapter 3, from a number of data of snow densities measured in our country, <b>the</b> changing behaviors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> permittivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snows</b> are examined using Cumming 2 ̆ 7 s relation. From these results, it becomes clear that, in general, <b>the</b> <b>snows</b> is an inhomogeneous medium for <b>the</b> waves <b>of</b> ultra-high frequencies, that is, <b>the</b> permittivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snows</b> must be represented by some functions of snow depth. These functional types are determined. Using these results, five model media are constructed to represent the snow-covered land. 　A number <b>of</b> data <b>of</b> <b>the</b> permittivity and density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snows</b> are shown in Appendix. 　In Chapter 4, numerical examples of reflection coefficients from the snow-covered land which is represeuted by five models are shown using the theoretical methods given in Chapter 1. and one of them is compared to experimental results, coincidence between both results is good if we assume that the land covered by snow is dry. 　In Chapter 5, it is shown that the theoretical treatments in this study are applicable not only <b>the</b> reflection phenomena <b>of</b> electro-magnetic wayes from the snow-covered land but also for more broad fields that elebtromagnetic or sound take part in...|$|R

5|$|On 21 February 2007, a Class 73 derailed {{after hitting}} an {{avalanche}} between Hallingskeid and Myrdal on the Bergen Line.

In particular, a DNV report from 1999 had shown that the train could act as a sled, lose contact with the tracks and slide on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow.</b> A former NSB employee who worked with route planning, stated that a locomotive-hauled train would be better suitable for such situations, because more of the weight is located {{at the front of the}} train, and it will therefore plow instead of slide. The National Rail Administration said that they took extra precautions for the Class 73 trains and that during snowfall they would run a snow-clearing unit ahead of all Class 73 runs. NSB stated that they would consider the possibility of reverting to conventional trains, but that unless new information could shed light on the situation, they would retain use of the Class 73 trains.|$|E
