40|$|Use of approximations for {{calculating the}} {{structural}} failure probability under uncertainties {{is a necessary}} aspect. But efficient use of suitable approximations {{at different stages of}} reliability prediction and design makes this valuable tool practical for many large scale structures. This research addresses the modern approximation concepts and their utility in structural reliability estimation. Emphasis is placed on building higher order approximations using intervening variables to closely represent the nonlinear limit state functions. Several test problems with highly nonlinear performance functions are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method. Many of the structural problems are modeled and simulated using the finite element methods (FEM) for obtaining a detailed structural response. FEM is a computationally intensive numerical procedure with a large number of degrees of freedom. With an increase in the complexity of the structural model and the multidisciplinary nature of analyses, the number of limit states and their computation increases very significantly. The requirement of frequent repetitive analysis of the structure hinders the utility of any tool and discourages that approach from being used. <b>One</b> particular <b>tool</b> which <b>faces</b> this difficulty is the computation of the structural reliability under parametric uncertainties...|$|R

40|$|Cutting tool {{premature}} failure, {{caused by}} tool fracture and chipping, {{is a frequent}} problem in the metal cutting area. For {{a certain type of}} cutting tool, correctly identifying its load profile and property profile is very crucial for prediction of the tool premature failure. The most direct way to evaluate the load profile and property profile of a cutting tool is to identify the stress working on it. This paper presents a new method for identification of the maximum principal stress and maximum effective stress subjected to a cutting tool in a cutting process. The method consists of four steps: estimation of the contact load on the <b>tool</b> <b>faces,</b> calculation of the maximum related stresses with the FEM, modelling of maximum related stresses with an artificial neural network and, finally, identification of the maximum principal stress, σe, and maximum effective stress, σe, with the use of measured cutting forces or cutting parameters.

40|$|Monolithic {{nuclear fuel}} is {{currently}} being developed for use in research reactors, and friction bonding (FB) is a technique being developed to help in this fuel’s fabrication. Since both FB and monolithic fuel are new concepts, {{research is needed to}} understand the impact of varying FB fabrication parameters on fuel plate characteristics. This thesis research provides insight into the FB process and its application to the monolithic fuel design by recognizing and understanding the microstructural effects of varying fabrication parameters (a) FB tool load, and (b) FB <b>tool</b> <b>face</b> alloy. These two fabrication parameters help drive material temperature during fabrication, and thus the material properties, bond strength, and possible formation of interface reaction layers. This study analyzed temperatures and tool loads measured during those FB processes and examined microstructural characteristics of materials and bonds in samples taken from the resulting fuel plates. This study shows that higher tool load increases aluminum plasticization and forging during FB, and that the <b>tool</b> <b>face</b> alloy helps determine the tool’s heat extraction efficacy. The study concludes that successful aluminum bonds can be attained in fuel plates using a wide range of FB tool loads. The range of tool loads yielding successful uranium-aluminum bonding was not established, but it was demonstrated that such bonding can be attained with FB tool load of 48, 900 N (11, 000 lbf) when using a FB <b>tool</b> <b>faced</b> with a tungsten alloy.

40|$|Abstract. Natural Language {{processing}} (NLP) {{systems are}} typically {{characterized by a}} pipeline architecture in which several independently developed NLP tools, connected as a chain of filters, apply successive transformations to the data that flows through the system. Hence when integrating such <b>tools,</b> <b>one</b> may <b>face</b> problems that lead to information losses, such as: (i) tools discard information from their input which will be required by other tools further along the pipeline; (ii) each tool has its own input/output format. This work proposes a solution that solves these problems. We offer a framework for NLP systems. The systems built using this framework use a client server architecture, in which the server acts as a blackboard where all tools add/consult data. Data is kept in the server under a conceptual model independent of the client tools, thus allowing the representation of {{a broad range of}} linguistic information. The tools interact with the server through a generic API which allows the creation of new data and the navigation through all the existing data. Moreover, we provide libraries implemented in several programming language that abstract the connection and communication protocol details between the tools and the server, and provide several levels of functionality that simplify server use. ...|$|R

The present work not only compares computational approaches to the solution of shear plane and <b>tool</b> <b>face</b> temperatures, but also explains why {{there is a difference}} when calculating temperatures generated during the micromachining process. The analysis shows that the computed temperature of the shear plane never exceeds 35 Â°C when micromilling at spindle speeds approximately 310, 000 rpm. Machining AISI 1040 steel at significantly high speeds presents significant challenges to prevent the accelerated wear of the cutting tool that is caused by the frictional interactions between chip and tool {{and the nature of the}} intermittent contact. The analysis also shows the effect of coating at reducing the interface temperatures between chip and tool, and concludes that each coating has very little effect at reducing temperature at the <b>tool</b> <b>face</b> and at the primary shear zone.
