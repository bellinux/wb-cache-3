5|$|Fate {{intervenes}} {{one night}} at a club, where the Castillo brothers have a part-time job. Nestor's love ballad captures the interest of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers,</b> who {{turns out to be}} the Cuban bandleader and American television star Desi Arnaz (played by his son, Desi Arnaz, Jr.). After a pleasant evening in Nestor and Delores's home, Arnaz generously invites the struggling Castillos to sing and act on an episode of his smash sitcom series, I Love Lucy.|$|E
5|$|In July 1889, Police Constable Luke Hanks was {{investigating}} a theft from the London Central Telegraph Office. During the investigation, a fifteen-year-old telegraph boy named Charles Thomas Swinscow was discovered {{to be in}} possession of fourteen shillings, equivalent to several weeks of his wages. At the time, messenger boys were not permitted to carry any personal cash {{in the course of}} their duties, to prevent their own money being mixed with that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers.</b> Suspecting the boy's involvement in the theft, Constable Hanks brought him in for questioning. After hesitating, Swinscow admitted that he earned the money working as a prostitute for a man named Charles Hammond, who operated a male brothel at 19 Cleveland Street. According to Swinscow, he was introduced to Hammond by a General Post Office clerk, eighteen-year-old Henry Newlove. In addition, he named two seventeen-year-old telegraph boys who also worked for Hammond: George Alma Wright and Charles Ernest Thickbroom. Constable Hanks obtained corroborating statements from Wright and Thickbroom and, armed with these, a confession from Newlove.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{conceptual}} paper that examines <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> service encounter on customers’ perceptual states. A cyclical process comprising five phases is proposed, with <b>the</b> main constructs <b>of</b> each phase being identified. A {{key element in}} all five phases is <b>the</b> persona <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customer,</b> an element that ensures that every encounter, however uniform in principle, is perceived differently. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> changes made on customers various perceptual states as they proceed through the process is also acknowledged, which in turn affects the future purchase behaviour <b>of</b> each <b>customer.</b> <b>The</b> contribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper is the five part model which describes the process in five phases, <b>the</b> holistic perspective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> service encounter cycle, and <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> persona and <b>the</b> changing perceptual states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customer...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{growth of}} Hong Kong {{depended}} greatly on domestic transport of citizens and cargo across Victoria Harbour.

Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> later included the Spanish government in the Philippines and the Chinese navy. The Peak Tram would begin in 1888 along with the Tramway service in 1904. The first railway line was also launched in 1910 as the Kowloon-Canton Railway.|$|E

Even in the city of Ibb, where water supply is intermittent, 47% of customers declared they were satisfied. In the town of Amran, where the situation was similar, even 74% of customers were satisfied. It may be that customers have become accustomed to poor service quality and have correspondingly lowered their expectations. 77% of households said that they drank tap water.|$|E

Reportedly, the primary production line was to be located in Italy while a second production line in the US was under consideration. In 2015 AgustaWestland announced that the AW609 will be produced at its Philadelphia facility, the production site for the AW139, AW119 KXe and AW169. Two to three AW609 aircraft will be assembled there beginning in 2017, and once production matures, a second final assembly line is being considered for Italy.|$|E
25|$|Coffman et al. {{worked with}} a {{definition}} of the objective of a Web crawler that is equivalent to freshness, but use a different wording: they propose that a crawler must minimize the fraction of time pages remain outdated. They {{also noted that the}} problem of Web crawling can be modeled as a multiple-queue, single-server polling system, on which the Web crawler is the server and the Web sites are the queues. Page modifications are the arrival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers,</b> and switch-over times are the interval between page accesses to a single Web site. Under this model, mean waiting time for a customer in the polling system is equivalent to the average age for the Web crawler.|$|E

25|$|In Etruria, the pseudo-red-figure {{style was}} not just a {{phenomenon}} of the earliest phases, as it had been in Attica. Especially during the 4th century, some workshops specialised in this technique, although true red-figure painting was widespread among Etrurian workshops at the same time. Notable workshops include the Sokra Group and the Phantom Group. The Sokra Group, somewhat older, preferred bowls with interior decoration of Greek mythical themes, but also some Etruscan motifs. The phantom Group mainly painted cloaked figures combined with vegetal or palmette ornamentation. The workshops of both groups are suspected to have been in Caere, Falerii and Tarquinia. The Phantom Group produced until the early 3rd century BC. Like elsewhere, the changing tastes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> eventually led to the end of this style.|$|E
25|$|After {{attending}} Eddie Ringan's funeral, Rebus has {{a suspicion}} of what happened. After checking the reservations {{book for the}} Heartbreak Cafe, he finds out that none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> remember Willie making a scene and storming out. His suspicions confirmed, Rebus goes to Eddie and Pat's flat, and finds the still living Eddie Ringan hiding there. He and Pat had rendered Willie unconscious by forcing alcohol down his throat, and used his body to stage a suicide attempt. Rebus arrests Eddie, but while taking {{him back to the}} station, stops in front of Cafferty's mansion. Eddie is clearly terrified of Cafferty, and admits that he helped burn down the Central Hotel, after a blood-splattered Aengus Gibson ran into the hotel kitchens.|$|E
25|$|Overshadowed by the Wang VS, the 2200 languished as a cost-effective, but {{forgotten}} {{solution in}} the hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> who had it. In the late 1980s Wang revisited the 2200 series one last time, offering 2200 customers a new 2200 CS with bundled maintenance for less than customers were then paying just for maintenance of their aging 2200s. The 2200 CS was accompanied by an Intel 386 processor, updated disk units and other peripherals. Most 2200 customers upgraded to the 2200 CS, after which Wang never again developed or marketed any new 2200 products. In 1997, Wang reported having about two hundred 2200 systems still under maintenance around the world. Throughout, Wang had always offered maintenance services for the 2200.|$|E
