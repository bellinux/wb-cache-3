5|$|Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Squidward {{that it is}} {{a perfect}} {{opportunity}} for his business rival, Plankton to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick as a security guard so he does not have to pay for a real one, and SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab. Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture that he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> door and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. Mr. Krabs remembers that {{there is a way to}} escape without using the door, which is through the ventilation system. While finding their way through the maze of air vents, they look back at some memorable moments in their lives.|$|E
25|$|The {{general layout}} of the House was largely {{untouched}} from the previous non-celebrity series. The living room and bedroom had no noticeable changes. There were several single beds in the same room, with one double bed, meaning that two housemates (Leo and Donny) had to share. The bathroom is much smaller than previous versions and the toilet and shower were no longer fitted with cameras. The dining room table was moved inside, and the kitchen fully equipped with modern conveniences. Outside the garden was a three-jet hot tub with a farmyard seating area. The bridge to Nowhere was still present, leading to a sitting area with heated seats and the topiary man. A workout area was situated just <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> area. Inside the House {{there was also a}} fax machine built into the wall. On day 24 this was used to post viewers' questions to the housemates. Meanwhile, the Diary Room was identical to the previous summer's Big Brother, with an oversized gold chair and padded walls, the only change being the addition of yellow lights facing the walls.|$|E
25|$|Odie is a yellow, long-eared beagle with a large, slobbering tongue, {{who walks}} {{on all four}} legs, though {{occasionally}} he will walk on two like Garfield. He was originally owned by Jon's friend Lyman, though Jon adopted him after Lyman was written out of the strip. The book Garfield: His 9 Lives (1984) retcons Odie's origin: {{there is no mention}} of Lyman, and Odie was a puppy when he was acquired by Jon as company for Garfield (when Garfield was a kitten). Odie is usually portrayed as naïve, happy, affectionate and blissfully unaware of Garfield's cynical, sadistic nature, despite the physical abuse Garfield exhibits toward him, including regularly kicking him <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> table or tricking him into going over the edge himself. On some occasions, however, he is depicted more intelligently, as one strip, in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent Garfield from doing this, and actually hurts Garfield's foot. In one strip when Garfield and Jon are out of the house, Odie is seen reading War and Peace and watching a television program, An Evening With Mozart. Odie has only talked once. In another strip, published on January 28, 2010, he is seen solving Jon's sudoku puzzle.|$|E

25|$|In 1896, Charlie Russell {{and his new}} wife, Nancy, {{were living}} in a shack in back of a house in Cascade, Montana. In 1897, the couple moved into a rented four-room home on Seventh Avenue North in Great Falls. In December 1899, Russell's father Charles Silas Russell gave the couple $500. The estate of Mary Mead Russell, Russell's mother who died in 1895, was finally probated shortly thereafter, and in the spring of 1900 the Russells began {{building}} a new home on the corner of 13th Street and 4th Avenue North. A friend and neighbor, George Calvert, was the likely architect and constructed the house for them. The two-story wood frame building had clapboard siding, gable roof, and wooden shake roofing shingles. It had little exterior ornamentation. The house faced south, with gable fronted dormers on the east and west and another project slightly from the southwest corner of the house. The front door led to a small front hall, and a parlor ran across the south face of the home. Also on the first floor were dining room, bathroom, kitchen, and a small maid's room <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Some of the furniture on first floor (such as two seats, a china closet, a bookcase) were built into the home. A steep stairway led to three small bedrooms (under the gables) and a small bathroom on the second floor. The interior was paneled in dark wood. A small exterior porch ran around the southeast corner of the home. The architectural style was in the Arts and Crafts genre. The Russells occupied the home in the summer of 1900.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Series 5, set {{three months after the}} birth, Rachel appears overprotective of Matthew; she refuses to let Adam hold him and never lets him out of her sight. After Adam abruptly leaves Matthew's naming ceremony, feeling unable to love his child because he is coming between him and his wife, Rachel reveals that the baby fell <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> table when she left him unattended for a matter of seconds. Baxendale said of the story, [...] "Rachel's take on motherhood is quite real in my experience because she's had such trouble conceiving for a start and then all the problems with the birth [...] She becomes obsessed with the baby and excludes Adam from everything. They have to work hard to resolve their differences and there is a big transition. I can see why she behaves the way she does—you do become over-protective with a baby. It's amazing what your body does to you and the instincts that suddenly take over. Being a mum myself, I have got real empathy with Rachel." [...] However, Observer television reviewer Kathryn Flett criticised the plot as unrealistic: ...|$|E

60|$|In {{gathering}} up my cloak and doublet and other effects to bear them <b>off</b> to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>the</b> host would have possessed himself also of my sword. But {{with a laugh}} I took it from him, remarking that it required no drying.|$|R
6000|$|The old man still sat {{fiddling}} softly {{after his}} wife disappeared in the hot and stuffy little bedroom <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> His shaggy head bent lower over his violin. He heard her shoes drop-one, two. Pretty soon she called: ...|$|E
60|$|Billy, who {{had taken}} no part in the conversation, got up, glanced into the bedroom <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> went into the parlor and the bedroom off the parlor, then {{returned}} and stood gazing with puzzled brows into the kitchen bedroom.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned to}} the door of a room opening <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> but Theodosia, who had hardly heard her, was before her. She was inside the room before the nurse could prevent her. Then she stood, afraid and trembling, her eyes searching the dim {{apartment}} hungrily.|$|E

60|$|My {{position}} was altered at the post. From working about the headquarters office, I {{was transferred to}} the colonel's living quarters.

6000|$|Thus admonished, {{the girl}} ran {{to a small}} {{apartment}} that opened <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and speedily reappeared in another tunic.

60|$|Mr. Leonard drew a {{long breath}} of relief. He knew that promise would be kept. So did old Abel. The latter crossed the floor and sullenly took the violin from Felix's relaxed hand. Without a word or look {{he went into the}} little bedroom <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and shut the door with a slam of righteous indignation. But from its window he stealthily watched his {{visitors}} go away. Just as they entered on the maple path Mr. Leonard laid his hand on Felix's head and looked down at him. Instantly the boy flung his arm up over the old man's shoulder and smiled at him. In the look they exchanged there was boundless love and trust--ay, and good-fellowship. Old Abel's scornful eyes again held the golden flash.|$|E
500|$|Many {{other changes}} were {{relatively}} minor. The new books were bound in yellow with color illustrations {{on the front}} covers.

Housekeeper Hannah Gruen, sent <b>off</b> to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> in early stories, became less a servant and more a mother surrogate.|$|R
50|$|The family returns home, where Joshua's {{mother is}} seen eating {{food from the}} refrigerator.

Joshua screams in horror.|$|R
50|$|Attached to the {{enclosed}} back verandah is {{a sequence of}} small additions. There are two small, early, timber-framed, gable-roofed structures which were likely originally kitchen houses, one behind the other, and accessed through each other. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> house adjoining <b>the</b> main building is the larger. These are now clad with fibrous cement sheeting, {{and it is not}} clear whether the original timber boarding (possibly single-skin) survives. <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> second <b>kitchen</b> house, at <b>the</b> rear, is a semi-open skillion-roofed laundry area, and attached to this, a small, later, skillion-roofed drying area with fibrous cement sheeting to balustrade height.|$|R
