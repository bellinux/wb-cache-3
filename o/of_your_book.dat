500|$|The Beagle {{reached the}} Cape of Good Hope on 31 May. In Cape Town Darwin {{received}} a letter dated 29 December from his sister Caroline telling him that his fame was spreading. On 18 November 1835 Sedgwick had read extracts from Darwin's geological notes to the Geological Society of London, and this had been reported in The Athenæum on 21 November. On 25 December their father {{received a letter}} from Henslow which said that Darwin would become one of the premier naturalists of the time, and enclosed some copies of a book of extracts of Darwin's letters on South American geology which had been printed for private distribution. Their father [...] "did not move from his seat till he had read every word <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>book</b> & he was very much gratified – he liked so much the simple clear way you gave your information". Darwin was horrified that his careless words were in print, but No hay remedio (it can't be helped). He explored the geology of the area, reaching conclusions about slate formation and the injection of granite seams as liquid which differed from the ideas of Lyell and Sedgwick. The zoologist Andrew Smith showed him formations, and later discussed the large animals living on sparse vegetation, showing that a lack of luxuriant vegetation did not explain the extinction of the giant creatures in South America.|$|E
2500|$|The Cilician Catastrophe {{received}} wide acclaim and {{is considered}} an important study of the events in Adana. The Catholicos of Cilicia Sahak II praised Terzian by stating that he [...] "has created an indelible impression upon everyone as a serious and trustworthy chronicler. It is a laborious, inquisitive, vivid picture of the Great Calamity, brought to white light from under the ruins and ashes by a native son of Cilicia, which will remain an everlasting stain upon the glorified civilization and unquenchable humanism of the twentieth century." [...] Archbishop Yeghishe Tourian {{wrote in a letter}} to Terzian, [...] "I have read your Giligio Aghedu [...] with great pain in my heart. It is not a red thread that runs through the white pages <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>book,</b> but a wide, black band that stands out defiantly against the bloody pages." [...] Malachia Ormanian, the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, described the narrative as [...] "the most complete and perfect work" [...] on the events in Adana.|$|E
2500|$|Rav Nahman bar Isaac {{derived from}} the words [...] "if not, blot me, I pray, out <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> <b>book</b> that You have written" [...] in [...] that three books are opened in heaven on Rosh Hashanah. Rav Kruspedai said {{in the name of}} Rabbi Johanan that on Rosh Hashanah, three books are opened in Heaven – one for the {{thoroughly}} wicked, one for the thoroughly righteous, and one for those in between. The thoroughly righteous are immediately inscribed definitively in the book of life. The thoroughly wicked are immediately inscribed definitively in the book of death. And the fate of those in between is suspended from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur. If they deserve well, then they are inscribed in the book of life; if they do not deserve well, then they are inscribed in the book of death. Rabbi Abin said that [...] tells us this when it says, [...] "Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous." [...] "Let them be blotted out from the book" [...] refers to the book of the wicked. [...] "Of the living" [...] refers to the book of the righteous. [...] "And not be written with the righteous" [...] refers to the book of those in between. Rav Nahman bar Isaac derived this from [...] where Moses told God, [...] "if not, blot me, I pray, out <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> <b>book</b> that You have written." [...] "Blot me, I pray" [...] refers to the book of the wicked. [...] "Out of Your book" [...] refers to the book of the righteous. [...] "That you have written" [...] refers to the book of those in between. It was taught in a Baraita that the House of Shammai said that there will be three groups at the Day of Judgment – one of thoroughly righteous, one of thoroughly wicked, and one of those in between. The thoroughly righteous will immediately be inscribed definitively as entitled to everlasting life; the thoroughly wicked will immediately be inscribed definitively as doomed to Gehinnom, as [...] says, [...] "And many of them who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life and some to reproaches and everlasting abhorrence." [...] Those in between will go down to Gehinnom and scream and rise again, as [...] says, [...] "And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on My name and I will answer them." [...] Of them, Hannah said in [...] "The Lord kills and makes alive, He brings down to the grave and brings up." [...] The House of Hillel, however, taught that God inclines the scales towards grace (so that those in between do not have to descend to Gehinnom), and of them David said in [...] "I love that the Lord should hear my voice and my supplication [...] [...] [...] The cords of death compassed me, and the straits of the netherworld got hold upon me," [...] and on their behalf David composed the conclusion of [...] "I was brought low and He saved me."–17a1.|$|E

60|$|Thus have I razed the {{foundation}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>book,</b> even by overthrowing the holiness, and righteousness, which by you is set up, {{as that which}} is the only true gospel, and evangelical.
