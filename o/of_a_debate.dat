Critics questioned whether Brown should have quoted the profane comments in front of a high school audience.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{discussed}} Not in Front of the Children in academic journal articles, and characterized it {{as a work}} which balances education policy against {{the negative consequences of}} censorship. In an article for Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, Middlebury College women's studies professor Deborah Grant compared the book to Harmful to Minors by Judith Levine. Grant characterized both books as significant works emphasizing the importance of allowing youths access to informative educational resources. She classed Heins' monograph as a thorough and important survey of the chronology of censorship. Perry L. Glanzer wrote in English Journal that Heins had a valid viewpoint to engage students on controversial topics in literature classes, and he added it was necessary to teach them all perspectives <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate.</b> Ellen P. Goodman wrote for Berkeley Technology Law Journal that Heins was critical of prior articles which attempted to show negative impact from violence as portrayed on television programs.|$|E

25|$|Innes was {{involved}} in virtually every significant act in Cape political life during {{his years as a}} parliamentarian, and his alliance with Merriman and Sauer was a formidable one.

This presaged first-wave feminism in the English-speaking world. Many of them are believed to have female editors and journalists, but as they were customarily written under anonymous pseudonyms, most of them have not been identified.

25|$|At {{the same}} time, Toronto built Malton Airport as a {{secondary}} air field, {{but it was}} Malton that became Toronto's main airport. This fact meant that the island airport became used mainly for general civil aviation and lost money on its operations. During the 1940s and 1950s, several political leaders proposed {{the expansion of the}} airport as a way to enable scheduled passenger airlines and reduce the airport deficits. An expansion of runways and facilities was completed in 1962, financed by the sale of Malton Airport to the Government of Canada. Despite the improvements, the island airport did not become a passenger airline hub, and its existence came into question, starting in the 1960s. In 1968, the site was proposed for a large housing development known as 'Harbor City.' In the 1970s, as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate</b> around airports serving Toronto, the airport became the focus of efforts to set up a network of airports in Canada serving Short-Take-Off-And-Landing (STOL) regional airlines. From a peak of over 200,000 annual flights in the 1960s, the island airport went into decline even as several regional airlines operated at the airport from the 1970s onwards. The annual operating deficit forced its operator, the Toronto Harbour Commission (THC) to sell land to pay the ongoing deficit and by the 1990s, the airport was again facing questions about its continued existence.|$|E

It took several years for the legislature to fulfill its promise, partly because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate</b> about whether a new public university should be founded to replace the territorial university. The 1820s saw the start of free public township schools. During the administration of William Hendricks, a plot of ground was set aside in each township {{for the construction of}} a schoolhouse.|$|E
500|$|Ethicist Jack Marshall {{described}} [...] "Think of the children!" [...] as {{a tactic}} {{used in an}} attempt to end discussion by invoking an unanswerable argument. According to Marshall, the strategy succeeds in preventing rational debate.

Marshall wrote that although the phrase's use may have a positive intention, it evokes irrationality when repeatedly used by both sides <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate.</b> He concluded that the phrase can transform the observance of regulations into an ethical quandary, cautioning society to avoid using [...] "Think of the children!"

The debacle was repeated in 1965; this time, when the Speaker left the chair to go to the House of Lords, some members continued to make speeches. As a result, the Royal Assent Act 1967 was passed, creating an additional form for the granting of royal assent. As the attorney-general explained, [...] "there has been a good deal of resentment not only at the loss of Parliamentary time that has been involved but at the breaking of the thread of a possibly eloquent speech and the disruption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate</b> that may be caused."
