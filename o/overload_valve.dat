40|$|The recent {{revision}} (table 1) of the defi-nition of a cardiomyopathy by theWorld Health Organization 1 recognises that ventricular dysfunction {{can result}} from a failure to correct volume or pressure <b>overload</b> in <b>valve</b> disease or to control hypertension. Loss of myocardium caused by coronary artery disease also leads to severe ventricular dysfunction. All of these end stage conditions are categorised as specific cardiomyopathies. The second form of cardiomyopathy is caused by intrinsic disorders of the myocardium itself and is subdivided {{on the basis of}} the pathophysiology. Such a functional rather than an aetiological classification has drawbacks but reflects our current state of knowledge. The diVerent functional abnormalities pro...|$|R
40|$|The valve, {{especially}} as an <b>overload</b> safety <b>valve</b> for a mechanical press, has a mechanical {{lock on the}} valve piston (1) in the pressure medium flow path between an entry (7) and outlet (9) opening. The lock is a screw which is broken by a pyrotechnic or explosive action. The valve piston (1) has {{the structure of a}} step piston, where it is under loading from the pressure medium. USE - The safety valve is for protection of a mechanical press from damage through overloading. ADVANTAGE - The structure gives a more rapid opening action and the valve piston movement is dampened at the end phase of the opening operation. The system also prevents premature closure of the valve...|$|R
40|$|Théberge (1997) {{has argued}} the {{modification}} of instruments {{to lead to}} a change of playing or even to establish completely new playing techniques. The introduction of amplification marked such a cornerstone of guitar playing. <b>Overloaded</b> <b>valves</b> caused the amplifier to distort, and this new sound has led to new practices on the electric guitar. Research on the electric guitar in blues, rock, and metal music has mostly been focused on historical reconstruction, structural analysis, or cultural interpretation. Studies on how distortion affects the guitar’s playability are still on the fringes, yet such knowledge from the musician’s perspective is needed to interpret guitar performances within the larger cultural context. This article aims at contributing acoustic evidence to the practice of electric guitar playing by investigating the effects of distortion on the instrument’s playability and expressiveness. The study followed an experimental design. Parts of five songs from six decades of rock music were re-recorded with different guitar sounds for analysing acoustic features. Visual representations like spectrograms, frequency curves, and dynamic waveforms were combined with acoustic feature extraction for a detailed analysis of the interrelation of sound and playing. The findings offer explanations of how the changing of acoustic features affects electric guitar playing. In some regards, distortion enhances the guitar’s potential as an expressive solo instrument confirming theoretical claims in academic literature. Yet, it can also reduce expressiveness and tonal variety, and force the player to put more effort into phrasing. The results contribute to an empirical foundation for future musicological and cultural studies oriented research to build on. In addition, the findings may be insightful for musicians, educators, producers, arrangers, composers, and bandleaders due to the pivotal role of the electric guitar’s characteristic sound in popular music...|$|R
40|$|The QRS amplitude, duration, {{and mean}} axis {{direction}} of the standard 12 -lead elec-trocardiogram were compared with left ventricular mass, volume, wall thickness, and stroke work in 112 adult patients. These patients had normal left ventricles or various degrees of left ventricular dilatation or hypertrophy. Left ventricular volumes and mass were determined by a quantitative angiocardiographic method. A significant but not a close correlation between left ventricular mass and ECG voltage was found. End-diastolic volume, stroke volume, stroke work, wall thickness, and "total left ventricular volume " (volume of left ventricular muscle and cavity at end-diastole) had generally lesser degrees of correlation with the QRS amplitude than did the mass alone. Sub-grouping of patients into those with pressure overload on the left ventricle, volume <b>overload,</b> aortic <b>valve</b> disease, or anatomic left ventricular hypertrophy did not improve correlations. The left ventricular hypertrophy voltage criteria of Sokolow and of Grant were assessed; respectively, 68 % and 67 % of 75 patients with anatomic hypertrophy had hypervoltage. The {{direction of the}} anatomic long axis of the left ventricle was not {{significantly related to the}} mean QRS-vector direction...|$|R
30|$|Hypertrophy (H) is an {{adaptive}} {{response of the}} heart to a hemodynamic overload. Severe left ventricular (LV) volume <b>overload</b> (VO) from <b>valve</b> regurgitations (aortic (AR) or mitral regurgitation) leads to eccentric LVH. Increased protein turnover is a major event during development of LVH and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key molecule for its control. The role of mTOR inhibition {{in the development of}} LVH using rapamycin for relatively short periods of time (days to a few weeks) has been studied in the past in pressure overload models but not in VO models. We investigated if mTOR pathway was activated during LVH development in a model of severe VO (AR) in rats and if a rapamycin treatment can slow heart remodeling in this situation.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Obtaining {{experimental}} {{data on the}} nature of the percolation transition processes in hydraulic drive on the basis of discrete-regulated axial-piston hydraulic machines; the comparison of {{experimental data}} with the results of numerical calculation. Methodology. The study of transient processes was carried out by means of a using a hydraulic drive on the basis of axial piston hydromachines of 403 series, with volume of 112 cubic centimetres on an experimental stand with a capacity recuperation. Pressure in pressure line and hydraulic motor control line, speed of pump rotation and flow rate through <b>overload</b> relief <b>valve</b> continuously registered. The experimental data were compared with results of numerical calculation. Scope of the results. The obtained results can be used when designing more efficient and reliable hydraulic drives of road-building machines. Conclusions. Comparison of experimental data and results of numerical calculation shows that the proposed by authors a mathematical model of hydraulic drive on the base of discrete-controlled axial piston hydromachines with cylinder?s tilting block, adequately reflects basic physical processes that determine the operation of hydraulic drive. For further improvement of the model it?s necessary to specify the model of hydraulic machine?s control block and consider wave effects in the pipelines of pressure line and hydraulic cylinders of pumping unit. ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ? ?????????????, ?? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????-????????? ?????????? ? ????????? ?????? ?????????, ??????????? ??? ????????? ? ????????? ?????? ?????? ????????????. ???????????? ?????????? ?????????????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ? ???????? ????? ? ????? ?????????? ??????? ??????? ????????????. ?????????? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ? ????? ???????????? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ???????? ?????? ? ?????? ????????? ????. ????????? ????????? ????????????????? ?????? ? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ? ?????? ?????????????? ?????? ???????? ????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????-????????? ??????????? ? ????????? ?????? ?????????...|$|R
2500|$|Water (feedwater) must be {{delivered}} to the boiler to replace that which is exhausted as steam after delivering a working stroke to the pistons. As the boiler is under pressure during operation, feedwater must be forced into the boiler at a pressure that {{is greater than the}} steam pressure, necessitating the use of some sort of pump. Early engines used pumps driven by the motion of the pistons (axle pumps), which were simple to operate and reliable, but only operated when the locomotive was moving, and could <b>overload</b> the <b>valve</b> gear and piston rods at high speeds. Steam injectors later replaced the pump, while some engines transitioned to turbopumps. Standard practice evolved to use two independent systems for feeding water to the boiler; either two steam injectors or, on more conservative designs, axle pumps when running at service speed and a steam injector for filling the boiler when stationary or at low speeds. By the 20th century virtually all new-built locomotives used only steam injectors – often one injector was supplied with [...] "live" [...] steam straight from the boiler itself and the other used exhaust steam from the locomotive's cylinders, which was more efficient (since it made use of otherwise wasted steam) but could only be used when the locomotive was in motion and the regulator was open.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{compare the}} effects of {{isolated}} right ventricular pressure and volume overload on left ventricular diastolic geometry and filling, 11 patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, 11 patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation due to tricuspid valve resection and 11 normal subjects were studied with use of Doppler echocardiography techniques. Right ventricular systolic overload in primary pulmonary hypertension resulted in substantial leftword ventricular septal shift that was most marked at end-systole and early diastole and decreased substantially by end-diastole. Right ventricular diastolic <b>overload</b> after tricuspid <b>valve</b> resection resulted in maximal leftward ventricular septal shift at end-diastole sparing end-systole and early diastole. The early diastolic distortion of left ventricular geometry associated with right ventricular pressure overload resulted in prolongation of isovolumetric relaxation of the left ventricle (129 ± 39 ms) {{and a reduction in}} early diastolic finding compared with values in normal subjects. Late diastolic distortion of left ventricular geometry associated with right ventricular volume overload had no influence on the duration of left ventricular isovolumetric relaxatoon (52 ± 32 ms) but caused a reduction in the atrial systolic contribution to late distolic filling of the left ventricle compared with values in normal sujects. In patients with right ventricular pressure overload, 52 ± 16 % of left ventricular filling occurred in early diastole compared with 78 ± 11 % in patients with right ventricular volume overload (p < 0. 001). The differential effects of systolic and diastolic right ventricular overload on the pattern of left ventricular filling appear to bt related to the timing of leftward ventricular septal displacement...|$|R
