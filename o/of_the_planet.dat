Jones' space mission lasted eleven days. Jones {{was a member of}} the crew of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which left Earth in April 1994. The mission was intended to provide the Space Radar Lab with a view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> By using three separate radar echoes, scientists were able to analyze a full image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> The radar technology could penetrate obstructions, including clouds and thick outgrowth of trees. Another purpose of the mission was to analyze the ecological state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> and to take measurements of pollution caused by carbon monoxide.|$|E

25|$|In Williams and Cremin the {{categories}} are: (1) models that regard {{the origin and}} formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> as being essentially related to the Sun, with the 2 formation processes taking place concurrently or consecutively, (2) models that regard formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> as being independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formation process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun, <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> forming after <b>the</b> Sun becomes a normal star; this has 2 subcategories: a) where the material for <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> is extracted either from the Sun or another star, b) where the material is acquired from interstellar space. They conclude that the best models are Hoyle's magnetic coupling and McCrea's floccules.|$|R
5|$|Naked eye {{observations}} of Venus during daylight hours exist in several anecdotes and records. Astronomer Edmund Halley calculated its maximum naked eye brightness in 1716, when many Londoners were alarmed by its {{appearance in the}} daytime.

Another historical daytime observation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> {{took place during the}} inauguration of the American president Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C., on 4 March 1865.

50|$|From {{ancient times}} until the 16th and 17th centuries, <b>the</b> motions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> were {{believed}} to follow perfectly circular geocentric paths as taught by the ancient Greek philosophers Aristotle and Ptolemy. Variations in <b>the</b> motions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> were explained by smaller circular paths overlaid on the larger path (see epicycle). As measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> became increasingly accurate, revisions to the theory were proposed. In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus published a heliocentric model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solar system, although he still believed that <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> traveled in perfectly circular paths centered on the sun.|$|R

The sixth imparts <b>the</b> teachings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian sages on <b>the</b> original position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> and <b>the</b> division <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zodiac.

The eighth chapter deals with <b>the</b> altitudes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b> <b>The</b> ninth chapter discusses <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heavenly bodies on earthly affairs.

5|$|A {{third part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> finding mission was {{the search for}} Jupiter-mass planets around young stars.

Planet hunting techniques using a star's radial velocity cannot measure the regular, tiny to-and-fro wobble motions induced by planets against the strong atmospheric activity of a youthful star. It is through the techniques pioneered by Albert A. Michelson that the SIM {{would have been able to}} execute its three primary planet-finding missions.|$|E
