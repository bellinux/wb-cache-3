50|$|History of Orientation and {{mobility}}Orientation {{and mobility}} training actually began after World War II when techniques {{were developed to}} help veterans who had been blinded. In the 1960s universities started training programs for <b>Orientation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mobility</b> Specialists who worked with adults and school-aged children. In the 1980s the O&M field recognized the benefit of providing services to preschool-aged children. Today, <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> <b>mobility</b> specialists have developed strategies and approaches for serving increasingly younger populations so that O&M training may begin in infancy.The profession of <b>Orientation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mobility</b> began to develop during, and immediately after, World War II, when soldiers who had been blinded in battle were sent to recuperate at Valley Forge Army General Hospital before entering Avon Old Farms Convalescent Hospital, the U.S. Army's former experimental rehabilitation center for blind soldiers in Avon, Connecticut.|$|E

In this article, the structural {{implications of a}} transformation in the educational vertical mobility concept due to alterations in functional specialization <b>and</b> referent group <b>orientation</b> is discussed.

40|$|Visible Light Communications (VLC) {{has been}} studied {{thoroughly}} {{in recent years as}} an alternative or complementary technology to radio frequency communications. The reliability of VLC channels highly depends on the availability and alignment of line of sight links. In this work, we study the effect of random receiver orientation for mobile users over VLC downlink channels, which affects the existence of line of sight links and the receiver field of view. Based on the statistics of vertical receiver <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> user <b>mobility,</b> we develop a unified analytical framework to characterize the statistical distribution of VLC downlink channels, which is then utilized to obtain the outage probability and the bit error rate. Our analysis is generalized for arbitrary distributions of receiver orientation/location for a single transmitter, and extended to multiple transmitter case for certain scenarios. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations show a perfect match between the analytical and the simulation data in terms of both the statistical channel distribution and the resulting bit error rate. Our results also characterize the channel attenuation due to random receiver orientation/location for various scenarios of interest. Comment: Submitted to IEEE JLT.

40|$|Baclofen 5 % {{cream can}} be used for the {{treatment}} of neuropathic pain. We describe an unusual case of a neuropathic pain patient with spinal cord injury. A 71 -year-old woman with a partial spinal cord injury lesion at L 4 complained of tingling, pins and needles, and burning in her legs. She scored her pain as 6 before adding baclofen 5 % cream to her pain medication (pregabalin 450 [*]mg, acetaminophen 3000 [*]mg, and diclofenac 150 [*]mg daily).

Here, by employing the newly developed surfactant-assisted chemical vapor deposition, high-quality and uniform GaSb NWs with controllable diameters, spanning from 16 to 70 nm, are successfully prepared, enabling the direct assessment of their growth <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> hole <b>mobility</b> {{as a function of}} diameter while elucidating the role of sulfur surfactant and the interplay between surface and interface energies of NWs on their electrical properties.

40|$|Students’ {{perceptions}} of graduate employability {{are not well}} known. This research contributes {{a new model of}} graduate employability, which constructs an emergent identity, underpinned by a human capital and contemporary career theory framework. An extensive literature review generated the conceptual model, validated by a pragmatic, sequential explanatory approach through a two-wave quantitative study of 387 participants (2015 / 2016 and 2016 / 2017), followed by interviews of 38 participants (2016 / 2017) across 21 degree subjects. Moderators of gender, degree subject, and year of study further advanced career theory. Human capital incorporated factors of social capital, cultural capital, psychological capital, scholastic capital, market-value capital, and skills. The contemporary career theory framework underpinned careers advice, career ownership via a protean career <b>orientation,</b> <b>and</b> career <b>mobility</b> via a boundaryless career orientation. This research validated protean and boundaryless career measures in an undergraduate population, contributing twenty dimensions of international, national, <b>and</b> local <b>mobility,</b> <b>and</b> a two-dimensional model of personal factors and market factors. Tuition fee increases, interest rate increases, and modest salary expectations meant that the majority of students did not believe they would repay their university debt in full.

Prospective students need a clear reason for pursuing higher education, validating the conservation of resources theory. The practical contribution of this research is to offer ways to prepare students for the graduate labour market, helping to enhance national competitiveness through making undergraduates more employable, and providing guidance to policy makers.

40|$|AbstractThe {{combination}} of temporal and spectral resolution in fluorescence microscopy based on long-lived luminescent labels offers {{a dramatic increase}} in contrast and probe selectivity due to the suppression of scattered light and short-lived autofluorescence. We describe various configurations of a fluorescence microscope integrating spectral and microsecond temporal resolution with conventional digital imaging based on CCD cameras. The high-power, broad spectral distribution and microsecond time resolution provided by microsecond xenon flashlamps offers increased luminosity with recently developed fluorophores with lifetimes in the submicrosecond to microsecond range. On the detection side, a gated microchannel plate intensifier provides the required time resolution and amplification of the signal. Spectral resolution is achieved with a dual grating stigmatic spectrograph and has been applied to the analysis of luminescent markers of cytochemical specimens in situ and of very small volume elements in microchambers. The additional introduction of polarization optics enables the determination of emission polarization; this parameter reflects molecular <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> rotational <b>mobility</b> <b>and,</b> consequently, the nature of the microenvironment. The dual spectral and temporal resolution modes of acquisition complemented by a posteriori image analysis gated on the spatial, spectral, and temporal dimensions lead to a very flexible and versatile tool. We have used a newly developed lanthanide chelate, Eu-DTPA-cs 124, to demonstrate these capabilities. Such compounds are good labels for time-resolved imaging microscopy and for the estimation of molecular proximity in the microscope by fluorescence (luminescence) resonance energy transfer and of molecular rotation via fluorescence depolarization. We describe the spectral distribution, polarization states, and excited-state lifetimes of the lanthanide chelate crystals imaged in the microscope...|$|R

An angle-dependent polarised Raman technique is developed to probe molecular order <b>and</b> <b>orientation</b> in 6, 13 -bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-pentacene) thin lms, and applied to understand the role of blending with polystyrene on morphology and charge transport properties in inkjet-printed organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).

To view, please open pdf attachment]. A zone-casting apparatus is developed to systematically control the grain size <b>and</b> molecular <b>orientation</b> of TIPS-pentacene thin films. Processing parameters such as solvent, solution temperature, substrate temperature and casting speed are systematically controlled to study film coverage, grain size, alignment <b>and</b> <b>orientation,</b> <b>and</b> applied to investigate charge transport properties in TIPS-pentacene and 6, 13 -bis(triethylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TES-pentacene) OFETs. Casting speed <b>and</b> grain <b>orientation</b> strongly influence device performance. TIPS- pentacene shows higher <b>mobilities</b> <b>and</b> grain-boundary-limited transport while TES-pentacene charge transport is limited by crystal orientation. The anisotropic structural and optical properties of TIPS-pentacene and TES-pentacene films are characterised using polarised UV-visible absorption and Raman spectroscopy. Evidence for J- and H-aggregation is found from a packing-induced red-shifted and blue-shifted absorption transition, respectively. Angle-dependent polarised Raman spectroscopy is used to probe the molecular <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> order in the films. The pentacene long-axis orientation is found to be ±(50 - 60) ° relative to the zone-casting direction for both materials, while TIPS-pentacene shows a higher Raman anisotropy than TES-pentacene. Quantum-chemical studies are performed on a range of conjugated polymer systems. Using simulated structure-property relationships, the effect of side chain placement & positioning, blending with small molecules, thermal annealing and heavy-atom substitution on the opto- electronic and charge transport properties of the polymers are discussed.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, implementation, {{and evaluation of}} a proximity-based dynamic path shortening scheme, called DPS. In DPS, active route paths adapt dynamically to node mobility based on the “local ” link quality estimation at each own node, without exchanging periodic control packets such as Hello packets. Each node monitors its own local link quality only when receiving packets and estimates whether to enter the “proximity”of the neighbor node to shorten active paths in a distributed manner. Simulation results of DPS in several scenarios of various node <b>mobility</b> <b>and</b> traffic flows reveal that adding DPS to DSR and AODV (conventional prominent on-demand ad hoc routing protocols) significantly reduces the end-to-end packet latency up to 50 -percent and also the number of routing packets up to 70 -percent over DSR, particularly in heavy traffic cases.
