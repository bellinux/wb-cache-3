In the late 1920s and 1930s Bernard Zammit and the Joseph Gasan, Giovanni Dacoutros & Grech Family started their own ferry services. More companies were formed after the war, including Joseph Gasan (1947-57), the Magro Family (1948-70), the Magro & Zammit Families (1958-68) and the Malta Aliscafi Ltd (1964-68). At some points there was only one company operating services in the Gozo Channel while at other times there were more at the same time.|$|E

His mother had taken this trail by covered wagon from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Cove, Oregon, in 1871. His mother and grandparents had taken two years to complete their trip, whereas Smith flew his route to California within a week with several stops along the way.He became an <b>official</b> air <b>mail</b> pilot on May 21, 1920.

This {{was the start of}} what became the South Africa Post Office (SAPO). By 1805 there was a regular inland <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> between Algoa Bay and False Bay in the Cape, using farmers on horseback. A mail wagon ran twice a week between Cape Town and the town of Stellenbosch. In 1806, Sir David Baird ruled that Khoi, enslaved indigenous people of the Cape, would be used to convey letters and small packages. A <b>mail</b> boat <b>service</b> was introduced between England and the Cape in 1815 and in 1848 the then Transvaal government appointed postmen to transport <b>official</b> <b>mail.</b> Prior to this development mail had been sent by special messenger, or by any available transport. The first stamp issued in South Africa was the Cape Triangular stamp introduced in 1853. The stamp has two values - the four pence blue and the one penny red. In 1860 the first postboxes were erected in the Cape and several railway lines were completed and used to transport mail. The first mail train was introduced in 1883.|$|R
