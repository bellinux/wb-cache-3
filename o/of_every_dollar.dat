500|$|During {{the first}} year of implementation, the FairTax {{legislation}} would apply a 23% federal retail sales tax on the total transaction value of a purchase; in other words, consumers pay to the government 23 cents <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>dollar</b> spent in total (sometimes called tax-inclusive, and presented this way to provide a direct comparison with individual income and employment taxes which reduce a person's available money before they can make purchases). The equivalent assessed tax rate is 30% if the FairTax is applied to the pre-tax price of a good like traditional U.S. state sales taxes (sometimes called tax-exclusive; this rate is not directly comparable with existing income and employment taxes). [...] After {{the first year}} of implementation, this tax rate would be automatically adjusted annually using a formula specified in the legislation that reflects actual federal receipts in the previous fiscal year.|$|E

The key {{finding is that}} the four major non-profits {{combined}} allocated just two cents <b>of</b> <b>every</b> donor <b>dollar</b> to Practical Cure research in 2012. The remaining ninety-eight cents <b>of</b> <b>every</b> donor <b>dollar</b> were used to fund other types of research and non-research activities. This allocation is inconsistent with donors' wish to have Practical Cure research well-funded. The report breaks down the ninety-eight cents <b>of</b> <b>every</b> donor <b>dollar</b> that is not directed to Practical Cure research to evaluate how donor contributions are being used {{at each of the}} four non-profits. Suggestions to better align donor interests with how their contributions are spent are also included.

The JDRF and ADA make abstracts for nearly all of their type 1 projects publicly available on their websites. The DRIF and Joslin do not make abstracts for individual research projects publicly available. In the case of the DRIF, the JDCA obtained and reviewed information on their 2012 projects from management and the Diabetes Research Institute. Joslin declined to provide any such information...|$|R
