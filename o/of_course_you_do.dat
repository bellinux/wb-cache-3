500|$|Snyder's {{first cut}} of the film was three hours long. In keeping the film tight, Snyder dubbed himself [...] "the gatekeeper" [...] of the comic's easter eggs, [...] "while [...] conspire to say, 'No. Length, length, length. Playability.' [...] I've lost {{perspective}} on that now, because to me, the honest truth is I geek out on little stuff now as much as anybody. Like, people will go, 'We've got to cut. You don't need that shot of Hollis Mason's garage sign.' And I'm like, 'What are you talking about? <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Are you crazy? How will people enjoy the movie without shit like that in it?' So it's hard for me." [...] Snyder cut the film down to 162 minutes when he realized {{there was a way}} to further trim the film: removing the murder of Hollis Mason, the first Nite Owl, which [...] "was easy without destroying the movie".|$|E

60|$|MISS BEECH. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Nobody {{else would}} at your age, but you do.|$|E
50|$|Interviewer: But <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> tease your {{brothers}} and sisters...|$|R
60|$|JOANNA (genially). <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> But {{never mind}} that; do {{tell us your}} name.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not give}} one to Ned Long. I {{thought you would}} never succeed in making him {{remember}} which is the ninth commandment.' ...|$|R
60|$|MRS WARREN. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Why, I {{have a whole}} {{album of}} your letters still: I came across them only the other day.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am your nearest neighbor, and so I {{have climbed}} {{up here to}} get acquainted. I am Agatha Lord, but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know me, because I came from Boston, whereas you came from--from--" ...|$|E
60|$|HIGGINS. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> You're her father, aren't you? You don't suppose {{anyone else}} wants her, do you? I'm {{glad to see}} you have some spark of family feeling left. She's upstairs. Take her away at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{she told}} me, <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>You</b> <b>did</b> what was quite right, and I {{should not have}} thought it {{necessary}} {{to speak to you}} had not Lord Bracy written to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Haven't had time," [...] he answered. [...] "Brooks {{had so much}} to say to me. You {{knew all}} about our land company, Brooks, <b>of</b> <b>course?</b> <b>You</b> <b>did</b> a bit <b>of</b> {{conveyancing}} for us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! to be a colonel, <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>You</b> <b>did</b> {{very well}} {{out there in}} France, you know, and it is thought {{advisable}} that the officer undertaking this special work should have a colonel's rank, just to begin with. Good-bye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes I know it is. I {{was merely}} joking. She has done {{no more than}} what every young woman would do; and I have no doubt of her being {{extremely}} happy. My other sacrifice, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not understand." ...|$|E
60|$|DORA. [sitting down genteelly] I {{dont know}} what youll say to me: you know I {{really have no}} right to come here; but then what was I to do? You know Holy Joe, Bobby's tutor, dont you? But <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{might as}} well try. He has set his heart upon it, and if he thinks that I have done his bidding then he will obey you. As for turning him out, Tom, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not really mean that!" ...|$|E
50|$|As {{they are}} released, Rose {{thinks of the}} Doctor, {{and is able to}} see him and tell him that they have done it. He says, <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it, and {{activates}} the tracers. The water in the Thames thickens and changes, and all the people who had been taken are pushed to the surface, restored to normal.|$|R
6000|$|... "In that respect, she {{had nothing}} to {{complain}} <b>of.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not notice it, as you had other things to think of, but it was handsomely furnished. There was a bed in an alcove, some flowers on the table, some books, and even a harpsichord--evidently it was intended that her imprisonment should be made as light as might be.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> And {{then the}} Devil {{went to work}} with you and {{prompted}} you to destroy it?" [...] He paused as though asking a question, but to this question Cousin Henry found it impossible to make any answer. [...] "But the Devil had not quite hold enough over you to make <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that? It was so;--was it not? There was a conscience with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you love}} him?" [...] For {{a moment or}} two Bessy {{remained}} silent, striving to arrange her words so that they should contain no falsehood, and yet betray no truth. [...] "Ah, I see you do," [...] continued Miss Holmes. [...] "But <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Why else did you accept him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Allonby {{leaned forward}} further, and {{clutched}} his arm. [...] "If {{you have any}} friends in the Old Country, beg or borrow from them. Offer them twenty per cent.--anything they ask. There is a fortune under your feet. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not believe it. Nobody I ever told it to would even listen seriously." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{will agree}} not to quarrel over it. I don't {{know how it is}} that we always see things so differently, Cuthbert. However, we may talk about your doings without arguing over the cause. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not suppose there will be much fighting--a week or two will see the end of it all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so;--but {{everyone}} {{who saw the}} letter would {{know that it was}} pretence and bombast. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> will <b>do</b> nothing <b>of</b> the kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know very}} little about {{pictures}} or how they are painted. If <b>you</b> can't <b>do</b> all that, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> can't. <b>Do</b> what <b>you</b> can, then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Your work--bah!... No, I didn't mean that. It's all right, dear. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> must <b>do</b> your work, and--I think I'll {{say good-bye}} for this week.' ...|$|R
6000|$|MORELL (sitting down to {{have his}} laugh out). Why, my dear child, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Everybody loves her: they can't help it. I like it. But (looking up whimsically at him) I say, Eugene: do you think yours is a case to be talked about? You're under twenty: she's over thirty. Doesn't it look rather too like a case of calf love? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do {{not know}} me," [...] I said. [...] "When you have read those papers, my own diary and my husband's also, which I have typed, you will know me better. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in this cause. But, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know me, yet, and I must not expect you to trust me so far." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The men {{know you}} have plenty of pluck, Bob; and they know that it was entirely due to your {{swimming}} off to that Spanish ship that we escaped being captured, before; and they will obey you willingly, {{as far as you can}} give them orders. Still, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> want somebody with you, to give orders as to the setting and taking in of the sails." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{think you}} are wrong, Ned--wrong altogether; but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> must <b>do</b> as <b>you</b> like in the matter. Have you sketched out any plan for yourself?' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{had better}} {{tell you that}} that letter of Monsieur Ferrand's to mother was impudent. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{n't know what was}} in it; but when Professor Brayne was asking you about him at breakfast, I felt that you {{believed}} that he was right and we were wrong, and I can't understand it. And then in the afternoon, when that woman hurt her horse, it was all as if you were on her side. How can you feel like that? ...|$|R
6000|$|She eyed Elspeth suspiciously. [...] "But <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> might <b>do</b> {{it just a}} little," [...] she said, pleadingly--"just to {{make them}} go on loving you, don't you think? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, papa; I {{have not}} said that. I was joking when I asked whether you wished to lose me. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not want to}} lose me." [...] Then she wound her arm round him, and put up her face to be kissed. [...] "But now come and dress yourself, as you call it. The dinner is late. We will talk about it again after dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As long as I {{know that}} you understand," [...] he whispered. [...] "But <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> It's a great {{satisfaction}} to have got somebody to understand. You {{seem to have been}} there on purpose." [...] And in the same whisper, as if we two whenever we talked had to say things to each other which were not fit for the world to hear, he added, [...] "It's very wonderful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you realize}} that you are buying me, Mr. Canler?" [...] she said finally, and in a cold, level voice. [...] "Buying me for a few paltry dollars? <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> Robert Canler, and the hope of just such a {{contingency}} was in your mind when you loaned papa the money for that hair-brained escapade, which but for a most mysterious circumstance would have been surprisingly successful.|$|E
6000|$|... "We have no objection," [...] Major Kurstad said. [...] "We shall {{also bring}} a surgeon with us, and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> the same, {{if you are}} disposed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is {{much better}} to stay where you are,' her mother said. 'You will come and spend the {{holidays}} with us, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>do</b> now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Dr. Quayle swung round for {{an instant}} so that his silk-lined {{overcoat}} rustled, and stared singularly at Turnbull. Then he said with hurried amiability: [...] "Why, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> Quite so, quite so," [...] and with courteous gestures went striding up the garden path. Under the first laburnum-tree he stopped, however, and pulling out his pencil and notebook wrote down feverishly: [...] "Singular development in the Elenthero-maniac, Turnbull. Sudden manifestation of Rapinavititis--the delusion that one has stolen a ship. First case ever recorded." ...|$|R
