For a 17 -d period, T- 2 toxin was added to the diet of the chickens. Fifty 22 -d-old male broiler chick-ens were divided into 5 groups that were supplemented with different concentrations of T- 2 toxin: control (0. 0 mg/kg <b>of</b> <b>feed),</b> T 0. 5 (0. 5 mg/kg <b>of</b> <b>feed),</b> T 1. 5 (1. 5 mg/ kg <b>of</b> <b>feed),</b> T 4. 5 (4. 5 mg/kg <b>of</b> <b>feed),</b> and T 13. 5 (13. 5 mg/kg <b>of</b> <b>feed).</b> Deoxyribonucleic acid fragmentation in spleen leukocytes, malondialdehyde in plasma and liver, total plasma antioxidative status, glutathione peroxidase activity, and total serum Ig (IgA and IgG) weremeasured.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundImproving feed {{efficiency}} (FEFE) {{is a key}} factor for any pig breeding company. Although this {{can be achieved by}} selection on an index of multi-trait best linear unbiased prediction of breeding values with optimal economic weights, considering deviations <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> intake from actual needs (RFIRFI) should be of value for further research on biological aspects of FEFE. Here, we present a random regression model that extends the classical definition of RFIRFI by including animal-specific needs in the model. Using this model, we explore the genetic determinism of several FEFE components: use <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> for growth (WGWG), use <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> for backfat deposition (FGFG), use <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> for maintenance (MWMW), and unspecific efficiency in the use <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> (RFIRFI).

ResultsBased on goodness-of-fit to the available feed intake (FIFI) data, the model that assumes individual (genetic and permanent) variation in the use <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> for maintenance, WGWG and FGFG showed the best performance.
