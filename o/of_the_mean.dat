5|$|In mathematics, the curve-shortening flow is {{a process}} that modifies a smooth curve in the Euclidean plane by moving its points perpendicularly to the curve at a speed {{proportional}} to the curvature.

Other names for the same process include the Euclidean shortening flow, geometric heat flow, and arc length evolution.|$|E

However, if {{a sufficiently}} large mass {{such as a}} mountain is nearby, its gravitational attraction should pull the pendulum's plumb-bob slightly out of true. The change in plumb-line angle against a known objectsuch as a starcould be carefully measured {{on opposite sides of}} the mountain. If the mass of the mountain could be independently established from a determination of its volume and an estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> density of its rocks, then these values could be extrapolated to provide the mean density of the Earth, and by extension, its mass.|$|E
5|$|Climate in {{a narrow}} sense is usually defined as the “average weather”, or more rigorously, as the {{statistical}} description in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> and variability of relevant quantities {{over a period of}} time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.|$|E
5|$|For {{surfaces}} in higher dimensions, {{there is more}} than one definition of curvature, including extrinsic (embedding-dependent) measures such as the mean curvature and intrinsic measures such as the Gaussian curvature and Ricci curvature. Correspondingly, there are several ways of defining geometric flows based on curvature, including the mean curvature flow (in which the normal speed of an embedded surface is its mean curvature), the Ricci flow (an intrinsic flow on the metric of a space based on its Ricci curvature) and the Willmore flow (the gradient flow for an energy functional combining the mean curvature and Gaussian curvature). The curve-shortening flow is a special case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> curvature flow for one-dimensional curves.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} historical and theological context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in <b>the</b> theology <b>of</b> John Wesley with <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> identifying its central role in his soteriology. Examining <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in its historical context requires locating <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in <b>the</b> English theological lexicon prior to Wesley and tracing Wesley's own inheritance <b>of</b> that tradition. <b>The</b> task <b>of</b> placing <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace within <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> Wesley's broader theological framework involves explaining how <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace, as disciplined practices engaged within <b>the</b> community <b>of</b> faith, lie at <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> his soteriology as it finds expression in the Christian life. It is argued {{that the best way}} to conceive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in Wesley's theology is as <b>the</b> "sacramental grammar" <b>of</b> his thought, grounded in <b>the</b> Wesleyan idea <b>of</b> social holiness, which names both the communal arena in which <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace are practiced and the salvific reality experienced by those joined together in such practice. Chapter 1 introduces the topic and explains the thesis. It describes the plan and scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dissertation, which is to locate John Wesley's doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in its historical and theological context. It lays out the approach, method, and sources for the project with reference to major scholarly texts that are engaged as well as the primary source material utilized. The chapter concludes by noting that, in addition to elucidating aspects of John Wesley's understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace not present in scholarship up to this point, it also intends to serve as a way to bring discipline to <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> Wesleyan language for <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in contemporary Wesleyan scholarship. Chapter 2 - "The History <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Means</b> <b>of</b> Grace: 16 th and 17 th Centuries" - analyzes <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in <b>the</b> Church <b>of</b> England after <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reformation. The chapter argues that <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace emerged as a way to describe the way God can be experienced through activities of devotion and worship, specifically after <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> full Roman Catholic sacramental system. It traces <b>the</b> particular use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in Puritan practical divinity and examines its inclusion in <b>the</b> Book <b>of</b> Common Prayer. <b>The</b> chapter concludes with a study of John Norris' use of "means of grace" as an example of doctrinal development at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18 th century. Chapter 3 - "The Reception and Development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Means</b> <b>of</b> Grace in John Wesley" - demonstrates Wesley's reception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace during <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> Oxford Methodism. It then goes on to trace Wesley's development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace specifically in relation to <b>the</b> influences <b>of</b> mysticism and Moravianism. The period it covers is from 1731 to 1746, at which time, it is argued, Wesley's doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace had reached a level of maturity as embodied in his publication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sermon, "The <b>Means</b> <b>of</b> Grace. " Chapter 4 - "The Content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Means</b> <b>of</b> Grace in John Wesley's Theology" - analyzes <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in Wesley's theology with respect to two main considerations: <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> grace and <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> themselves as "practices. " It also examines Wesley's categories of instituted means, prudential means, and general means, noting aspects of Wesley's distinctive understanding of each category. Chapter 5 - "The Character and Context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Means</b> <b>of</b> Grace" - brings <b>the</b> preceding work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dissertation into a consideration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> salvation in Wesley, specifically in relation to Wesley's understanding of present salvation as <b>the</b> recovery <b>of</b> holiness of heart and life. It then argues that Wesley's doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace is best characterized through an intersection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> "social holiness" as the environmental context in which <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace are practiced and holiness becomes manifest in the Christian community. Conclusion - The dissertation ends with a conclusion that summarizes the preceding chapters and underscores <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> social holiness in understanding <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in Wesley's theology and practice of ministry.

5|$|HD 205739 b is a Jupiter-size planet. The {{estimated}} minimum mass is 1.37 {{times the}} mass of Jupiter.

HD 205739 b has a mildly elliptical orbit, given its orbital eccentricity of 0.27. The planet's elliptical orbit is typical with respect to discovered planets whose orbits are longer than twenty days and have not grown circular because of tidal forces. According to its discoverers, HD 205739 b's elongated orbit causes its surface temperature to fluctuate by up to 100 K.|$|E

This was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory, in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a normal distribution of errors in the measurements), and included multiple date ranges (of 1σ confidence) that did not overlap with each other. The measurements included one with a range from about 4250 to about 4390 years ago, and another with a range from about 4520 to about 4690.|$|E

It turned north as a left-moving supercell, meaning it moved left {{with respect to the}} mean atmospheric flow. Left-moving supercells are very rare, as cyclonic storms usually turn to the right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> flow. It is unknown whether this leftward movement was due to an atmospheric interaction or terrain-induced movement, as the storm moved straight up the Connecticut River valley.|$|E

Conversely, if k is zero or negative, the Universe has infinite volume. It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when R=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when k does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite {{in one direction and}} a torus is finite in both.
