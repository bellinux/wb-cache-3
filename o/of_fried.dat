40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the quality <b>of</b> <b>frying</b> oil in eight randomly selected restaurants in Umeå. A further aim was to examine the techniques and control methods the various restaurants used. The methods used to answer the purpose was questionnaires, answered by the chefs, which was used to examine the procedures used in the handling <b>of</b> <b>frying</b> oils. To investigate the quality <b>of</b> the <b>frying</b> oils two types of quick tests were used, a Oxifrit-test and a TPM-test. The results showed that all food businesses had developed procedures for the handling <b>of</b> <b>frying</b> oils. Procedures for intermittent usage, change <b>of</b> <b>frying</b> oil, monitoring <b>of</b> the oil, cleaning and handling <b>of</b> <b>frying</b> oils after use existed at the eight restaurants. According to the recommendations of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für fettwissenschaft the observed routines does not meet all the criteria to achieve a good quality <b>of</b> <b>frying</b> oil, and therefore needs improvements. However the Oxifrit-test and TPM-test showed that the frying oils generally archive a good quality in the selected restaurants. There were only three restaurants where the oil should have been replaced. Further improvement of procedures might help to improve the quality <b>of</b> <b>frying</b> oil...|$|R

5|$|Throughout the world, {{different}} seasoning {{and spices}} {{are used to}} augment the flavor <b>of</b> <b>fried</b> chicken. Because of the versatility <b>of</b> <b>fried</b> chicken, {{it is not uncommon}} to flavor the chicken's crisp exterior with a variety of spices ranging from spicy to savory. Depending on regional market ubiquity, local spice variations may be labeled as distinct from traditional Southern U.S. flavors, or may appear on menus without notation. With access to chickens suitable for frying broadening on a global scale with the advent of industrialized poultry farming, many localities have added their own mark on fried chicken, tweaking recipes to suit local preferences.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{industrial}} frying {{systems are}} not optimised towards homogeneous product quality, which is partly related to poor oil distribution across the packed bed <b>of</b> <b>fries.</b> In this study we investigate an alternative frying system with an oil cross-flow from bottom to top through a packed bed <b>of</b> <b>fries.</b> Fluidization <b>of</b> rectangular <b>fries</b> during frying was characterised with a modified Ergun equation. Mixing was visualized by using two coloured layers <b>of</b> <b>fries</b> and quantified in terms of mixing entropy. Smaller fries mixed quickly during frying, while longer fries exhibited much less mixing, which was attributed to the higher minimum fluidization velocity and slower dehydration for longer fries. The cross-flow velocity was found an important parameter for the homogeneity of the moisture content <b>of</b> <b>fries.</b> Increased oil velocities positively affected moisture distribution due to a higher oil refresh rate. However, inducing fluidization caused the moisture distribution to become unpredictable due to bed instabilities. </p...|$|R

5|$|After the {{development}} of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, crop waste, and garbage into calories (in a relatively small space and {{in a relatively short}} period of time). Many of those calories came in the form of fat and rendered lard. Lard was used for almost all cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods) like biscuits and pies. The economic/caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity <b>of</b> <b>fried</b> foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, lard, a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken.|$|E

How these factors contributed to the delay in producing a transcription earlier will be considered. What motivated Fry to write her journal and what influenced her to continue the process unabated for all her adult life? The reasons Fry had originally given for her journal production changed as her journal evolved and her life priorities changed.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} nine- 320 m 2 - freshwater ponds to evaluate various techniques <b>of</b> harvesting tilapia <b>fry.</b> Three treatments with three replicates each were used: harvesting by seining the fry (Treatment I), daily harvesting <b>of</b> <b>fry</b> in ponds using fine-mesh scoop net (Treatment II) and harvesting <b>of</b> <b>fry</b> from hapa net cages installed in ponds (Treatment III). All broodstock ponds were prepared, maintained uniformly and sustained through fertilization at recommended dose. Results of the two trials/experiments indicated that the recovery <b>of</b> <b>fry</b> in hapa net installed in ponds is far superior {{than the other two}} techniques but mortality in all treatments is not significant. Hapa cages are used here as a tool for easy management as well as mechanical aid to prevent predation <b>of</b> <b>fry</b> and cannibalism inherent if fish is directly stocked in ponds. Hapa also served as substrate for natural food and additional grazing areas for young tilapia fry which resulted in high recovery...|$|R
5|$|Kitsune are {{associated}} with Inari, the Shinto deity of rice. This association has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. Originally, kitsune were Inari's messengers, but {{the line between the}} two is now blurred so that Inari Ōkami may be depicted as a fox. Likewise, entire shrines are dedicated to kitsune, where devotees can leave offerings. Fox spirits are said to be particularly fond of a fried sliced tofu called aburage, which is accordingly found in the noodle-based dishes kitsune udon and kitsune soba. Similarly, Inari-zushi is a type of sushi named for Inari Ōkami that consists of rice-filled pouches <b>of</b> <b>fried</b> tofu. There is speculation among folklorists as to whether another Shinto fox deity existed in the past. Foxes have long been worshipped as kami.|$|E
5|$|The term iftar has a {{different}} meaning in Ramadan where {{it is used to}} describe the 'breaking of fasting' unlike its common meaning of breakfast in the morning. Iftar begins with soup, either made from lentils, vegetables or freekeh. Shurbat freekeh ("freekeh soup") is made from cracked, green wheat cooked in chicken broth. There is a wide variety of meals served during iftar, ranging from small plates or bowls vegetable-based courses or saniyyehs (large plates or trays) of a particular meat. Common small dishes on the dinner table are bamia—a name for okra in tomato paste, mloukhiyeh—a corchorus stew—or maqali, an array <b>of</b> <b>fried</b> tomatoes, aubergines, potatoes, peppers and zucchini. Pilaf or plain freekeh are normally served alongside the dinner meat. Each household prepares extra food to provide for their neighbors and the less fortunate—who must receive an equal version of the food eaten at home.|$|E
