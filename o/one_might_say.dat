5|$|Though {{described}} {{often as}} a world, this was only physically true of Ivalice in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, in which Ivalice was created parallel to the real world. The 'true' Ivalice, as witnessed in the remaining games, describes two distinct locations; a geographical region, and a smaller kingdom, both of which belong to a larger, unnamed world. Generally, however, the term Ivalice {{is also used to}} refer to the conceptual setting, rather as <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> the Medieval world of Europe and the Mediterranean.|$|E

That makes analysis of feedback more complicated.|$|E
25|$|The derived {{category}} {{allows us}} to encapsulate all derived functors RnF in one functor, namely the so-called total derived functor RF: D+(A) → D+(B). It is the following composition: D+(A) ≅ K+(Inj(A)) → K+(B) → D+(B), where the first equivalence of categories is described above. The classical derived functors {{are related to the}} total one via RnF(X) = Hn(RF(X)). <b>One</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that the RnF forget the chain complex and keep only the cohomologies, whereas RF does keep track of the complexes.|$|E

Thought of as the effort of humanity to liberate imagination as an act of insurrection against society, Surrealism finds precedents in the alchemists, possibly Dante, Hieronymus Bosch, Marquis de Sade, Charles Fourier, Comte de Lautreamont and Arthur Rimbaud.|$|E
25|$|May we not say that, in the fortuitous {{combination}} of the productions of Nature, since only those creatures could survive in whose organizations {{a certain degree of}} adaptation was present, there is nothing extraordinary in the fact that such adaptation is actually found in all these species which now exist? Chance, <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> turned out a vast number of individuals; a small proportion of these were organized in such a manner that the animals' organs could satisfy their needs. A much greater number showed neither adaptation nor order; these last have all perished.... Thus the species which we see today are but a small part of all those that a blind destiny has produced.|$|E
25|$|If {{a problem}} X is in C and hard for C, then X {{is said to}} be {{complete}} for C. This means that X is the hardest problem in C. (Since many problems could be equally hard, <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that X is one of the hardest problems in C.) Thus the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, {{in the sense that they}} are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P=NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, Π2, to another problem, Π1, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for Π1. This is because a polynomial-time solution to Π1 would yield a polynomial-time solution to Π2. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P=NP.|$|E

25|$|The {{generality}} of the characterisation {{process is}} not and cannot be wholly scientific. It is always a matter of interpretation. For example, if A, who is a national of Arcadia, dies having made a valid local will and leaves land situated in Barsoom to C, who is domiciled in Catilage, how is the issue to be classified? <b>One</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that any rights that C might have are vested by the will that was made in Arcadia, the lex loci actus. Equally, the right to succeed to title might be an aspect of C's status as the oldest surviving male heir under Cartilagean law, the lex loci domicilii. Also, {{it may be a}} matter for the law of Barsoom since all matters of title to land must be adjusted by the lex situs, as the law of the place of the land. Thus, completely different judgments might result depending on how the forum court characterises the action.|$|E

Historians point out that the stability of the frontier over the centuries is remarkable, although Nisibis, Singara, Dara and other cities of upper Mesopotamia changed hands from time to time, and the possession of these frontier cities gave one empire a trade advantage over the other.

500|$|Robey {{returned}} to the London Hippodrome in 1919 where he took {{a leading role in}} another hit revue, Joy Bells. Phyllis Bedells took over from Pollard as his stage partner, with Anita Elson and Leon Errol as supporting dancers. Robey played the role of an old-fashioned father who is mystified over the changing traditions after the First World War. He interpolated two music hall sketches: [...] "No, No, No" [...] centred on turning innocent, everyday sayings into suggestive and provocative maxims, and [...] "The Rest Cure" [...] told the story of a pre-op hospital patient who hears worrying stories of malpractice from his well-meaning friends who visit him. In the Italian newspaper La Tribuna, the writer Emilio Cecchi commented: [...] "Robey, just by being Robey, makes us laugh until we weep. We {{do not want to see}} either Figaro or Othello; it is quite enough for Robey to appear in travelling costume and to turn his eyes in crab-like fashion from one side of the auditorium to another. Robey's aspect in dealing with his audience is paternal and, <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> apostolic." [...] Joy Bells ran for 723 performances.|$|E
500|$|Though {{at times}} Hazlitt delighted in actors' interpretations of Shakespearean characters, {{and he thought}} some of Shakespeare's plays eminently suited for the stage, he opens the chapter on Hamlet by proclaiming, [...] "We {{do not like to}} see our author's plays acted, and least of all, Hamlet". Here, more than {{anywhere}} else, he sides with Charles Lamb in believing Shakespeare's plays to suffer in stage presentation. Neither John Kemble nor his favourite actor Edmund Kean played the role of Hamlet to his satisfaction. [...] "Mr. Kean's Hamlet is as much too splenetic and rash as Mr. Kemble's is too deliberate and formal." [...] This, he felt, is a play to be read, and he noted that by his time it had already been so often read as to have become part of the common culture. [...] "This is that Hamlet the Dane, whom we read of in our youth". <b>One</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> he observes, that Hamlet is just a character in a play: [...] "Hamlet is a name; his speeches and sayings but the idle coinage of the poet's brain." [...] Yet Shakespeare gives those sayings a reality {{in the mind of the}} reader, making them [...] "as real as our own thoughts." ...|$|E

500|$|Addition {{of a text}} can {{effectively}} change the programmatic intent of a composition, as with the two choral symphonies of Franz Liszt. Both the Faust and Dante symphonies were conceived as purely instrumental works and only later became choral symphonies. However, while Liszt authority Humphrey Searle asserts that Liszt's later inclusion of a chorus effectively sums up Faust and makes it complete, another Liszt expert, Reeves Shulstad, suggests that Liszt changed the work's dramatic focus {{to the point of}} meriting a different interpretation of the work itself. According to Shulstad, [...] "Liszt's original version of 1854 ended with a last fleeting reference to Gretchen and an ... orchestral peroration in C major, based on the most majestic of themes from the opening movement. <b>One</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that this conclusion remains within the persona of Faust and his imagination". When Liszt rethought the piece three years later, he added a [...] "Chorus mysticus", the male chorus singing the final words from Goethe's Faust. The tenor soloist, accompanied by the chorus, sings the last two lines of the text. [...] "With the addition of the 'Chorus Mysticus' text", Shulstad writes, [...] "the Gretchen theme has been transformed and she no longer appears as a masked Faust. With this direct association to the final scene of the drama we have escaped Faust's imaginings and are hearing another voice commenting on his striving and redemption".|$|E
500|$|The Stone Tape was a {{significant}} influence on John Carpenter's 1987 film Prince of Darkness in which {{a group of scientists}} investigate a mysterious cylinder discovered {{in the basement of a}} church. Besides directing the film, Carpenter wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym [...] "Martin Quatermass", and included a reference to [...] "Kneale University". This homage did little to impress Kneale, who wrote in The Observer, [...] "For the record I have had nothing to do with the film and I have not seen it. It sounds pretty bad. With an homage like this, <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> who needs insults? I can only imagine that it is a whimsical riposte for my having my name removed from a film I wrote a few years ago [...] and which Mr Carpenter carpentered into sawdust". The play also influenced the 1982 Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper film Poltergeist. In the 2004 BBC7 Radio Serial [...] "Ghost Zone", a character refers explicitly to the [...] "Stone Tape theory" [...] as an explanation for the way an invading alien intelligence is [...] "replaying" [...] scenes and figures from the past of the remote Scottish village in which the story is set. Author Marty Ross has explicitly acknowledged the influence of Kneale's work, and the Quatermass serials in particular, on his own BBC SF drama.|$|E
