5|$|At 3:21 of the 1st round, after Wanderlei flurried {{and missed}} a punch {{with his right}} hand, Jackson countered with a left hook on Silva's jaw, sending the latter on to the canvas and {{rendering}} him unconscious. Jackson followed with three punches to Silva's head on the ground, two of which occurred after referee Yves Lavigne attempted to halt the contest. Wanderlei remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> for several moments, but appeared to be OK {{as he left the}} cage under his own power.|$|E
5|$|In December 1982 Jarrell was {{commissioned}} by Westinghouse Electric Company to create a three-hundred-foot mural in their Athens headquarters, to boost {{the morale of the}} employees. The mural {{was the first time he}} used a bricklayer's trowel in his work, a tool introduced to him by Adger Cowans. The Apple Birds and The Return of the Apple Birds, from 1983, show his dramatic use of the trowel. The paintings were inspired by a drawing by his daughter, Jennifer, at the age of two. The Apple Birds were drawn by and talked about by Jennifer as having apple-shaped heads with stems at the top, long arms and short bodies. Zigzags, geometric shapes and layers make up the environment that the Apple Birds live in <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b> The trowel is used throughout to create 3-D layers and overlaps.|$|E
5|$|Sabrina (Chaplin) {{walks down}} the stairs, and Ray puts the {{painting}} back and hides. Sabrina turns down Gerald's music to watch EastEnders. Gerald returns, sitting away from Sabrina. He turns up his music and the pair fight over the television remote, before leaving through the patio door and arguing, though their voices are muffled. Ray cuts away the canvas and replaces it with kitchen roll. When Sabrina reenters, she unknowingly stands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b> Kim picks it up, mistaking it for laundry, and heads into a laundry room as Sabrina walks upstairs. Eddie follows Kim and she sprays something into his eyes. Ray knocks out Kim and sees the canvas in a laundry basket, which is sent up a laundry chute. He runs upstairs, while Gerald remains outside.|$|E

25|$|In 1997 Jones had {{his first}} {{professional}} loss, a disqualification against Montell Griffin (26-0, 18 KOs) at the Taj Majal Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Griffin was trained by the legendary Eddie Futch, who had {{taught him how to}} take advantage of Jones technical mistakes and lack of basic boxing fundamentals. Griffin jumped out to an early lead on Jones but by round 9 Jones was ahead on the scorecards by a point and had Griffin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> early in round nine. But as Griffin took a knee <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> to avoid further punishment, Jones hit him twice. Subsequently, Jones was disqualified and lost his title. At the time of disqualification, Jones was ahead on two of the judges scorecards (75-76, 77-75, 76-75).|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{depicting}} {{the subject matter}} classically, from one point of view, Metzinger has used a concept of 'mobile perspective' to portray the subject {{from a variety of}} angles.

25|$|According to the first, all {{the parts}} are {{connected}} by a rhythmic convention which is determined by one of them. This—its position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> matters little—gives the painting a centre from which the gradations of colour proceed, or towards which they tend, according as the maximum or minimum of intensity resides there.|$|E
25|$|As {{opposed to}} {{depicting}} {{the subject matter}} classically from one point of view, Metzinger used a concept he enunciated {{for the first time}} in Note sur la peinture (published in Pan, 1910), of 'mobile perspective' to portray the subject from a variety of angles. The images captured from multiple spatial view-points and at successive intervals in time are shown simultaneously <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b>|$|E
25|$|In a one-off match {{outside of}} Glory in Trieste on March 2, 2013, {{he turned in}} an uncharacteristically {{aggressive}} performance against Ole Laursen as he dropped Laursen with a knee to the liver before knocking him out with a high kick immediately after, leaving the outmatched Dane unconscious <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> for several minutes.

25|$|On 15 June 1985, Rembrandt's 17th-century {{painting}} Danaë {{was attacked}} in the Hermitage Museum in Russia.

The entire {{central part of the}} composition was virtually destroyed. The restoration took 12years, between 1985 and 1997; since then, the painting has been protected with an armored glass.|$|E
25|$|In round seven, {{however, the}} 104,943 in {{attendance}} witnessed {{a moment that}} would live on in boxing history. With Tunney trapped against the ropes and near a corner, Dempsey unleashed a combination of punches that floored the champion. Two rights and two lefts landed on Tunney's chin and staggered him, and four more punches deposited him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b> It {{was the first time}} in Tunney's career that he'd been knocked down.|$|E

The coffins were {{arranged}} on the Texas afterdeck in groups and covered in canvas. Many American flags and wreaths evergreens and artificial flowers were placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> coverings, and the coffins guarded by U.S. Marines day and night until the ship reached Hampton Roads.|$|E

25|$|After an evenly matched 3 rounds, the 4th round started more in Maccarinelli's favour. Halfway {{through the}} round, Maccarinelli dropped Jones with an uppercut. Jones beat the count and carried on for 10–12 seconds more with his gloves to his face, eating several more uppercuts. Against the ropes, he then absorbed a huge right hook which {{caused him to}} stiffen and fall face down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b> Referee Ingo Barrabas waved off the fight in what was Jones' 9th career defeat, the 5th by KO.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{depicting}} the two nudes in the foreground, {{the rocks and}} trees in the background, from one point of view, Metzinger used a concept he wrote about {{for the first time}} in Note sur la peinture (published in Pan, 1910), of 'mobile perspective' to portray objects from a variety of angles, resulting in a multitude of image fragments or facets. In Two Nudes the models are captured from multiple spatial view-points and at successive intervals in time shown simultaneously <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b>|$|E
25|$|The lattices of squares or 'cubes' {{of paint}} {{employed}} throughout his Divisionist period {{have not been}} entirely abandoned, but pushed to another extreme. Where before brushstrokes had become increasingly larger and organized into groups of color, now they were larger still and elongated, seemingly blended together directly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> (rather than on a palette). The treatment of color and composition is globally free, loose, expressive, and thus dynamic. There are no inert tones. Colors have retained their brilliance. As before, contrasting hues are placed side by side—resulting in rhythmic and optic vibrational effects.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} after World War II, {{a group of young}} New York artists known as the New York School formed the first truly {{original}} school of painting in America that exerted a major influence on foreign artists: abstract expressionism. Among the movement's leaders were Jackson Pollock (1912–1956), Willem de Kooning (1904–1997), and Mark Rothko (1903–1970). The abstract expressionists abandoned formal composition and representation of real objects to concentrate on instinctual arrangements of space and color and to demonstrate the effects of the physical action of painting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b>|$|E
25|$|On September 25, 2004, Jones {{attempted}} {{to win the}} IBF Light Heavyweight title from Glen Johnson in a match in Memphis, Tennessee.

25|$|School of the Art Institute of Chicago student David Nelson created Mirth & Girth, a {{painting}} that depicted Washington wearing women's lingerie and holding a pencil, which was briefly displayed in a hallway at the school on May 11, 1988. City aldermen {{and members of the}} Chicago Police Department soon seized the painting then later returned it with a five-inch gash <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b> Nelson, assisted by the ACLU, subsequently filed a federal lawsuit against the city, claiming that the painting's confiscation and subsequent damaging violated his First Amendment rights. The complainants eventually split a US$95,000 (1994, US$138,000 in 2008) settlement from the city.|$|E
