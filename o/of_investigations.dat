5|$|At L'Ora, De Mauro {{joined a}} group of crack investigative reporters. From the mid-1950s to the 1970s the left-leaning {{newspaper}} often hit the national spotlight for its investigations and denunciations about the ties between the Sicilian Mafia and corrupt politicians. These were the golden years <b>of</b> <b>investigations,</b> signed by journalists like Mauro De Mauro, Felice Chilanti and Mario Farinella. De Mauro could exercise his skills as a successful investigative reporter. He wrote on drug trafficking and the Sack of Palermo, the construction boom in the 1950s and 1960s {{that led to the}} destruction of the city's green belt and ancient villas. He also published articles about the collusion between the Mafia and politics. In 1960 he was among the winners of the Premiolino, {{one of the most important}} Italian journalism awards, for his crime investigations.|$|E
5|$|By May 1878, {{all three}} Preussen-class ships {{were ready for}} the annual summer {{maneuvers}} of the armored squadron. The three ships were joined by the large armored frigate , and operated {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Batsch. Friedrich der Grosse missed the maneuvers after running aground off Nyborg, leaving Batsch just three vessels. While steaming in the English Channel on 31 May, König Wilhelm accidentally rammed Grosser Kurfürst; the latter quickly sank with the loss of between 269 and 276 men. Her loss spurred a series <b>of</b> <b>investigations</b> into the circumstances of the collision, which ultimately resulted in the acquittal of both Rear Admiral Carl Ferdinand Batsch, the squadron commander, and Count Alexander von Monts, the captain of Grosser Kurfürst. Political infighting over the affair led to ouster of Rear Admiral Reinhold von Werner from the navy.|$|E
5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic processing of information (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because <b>of</b> <b>investigations</b> in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
50|$|When the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Investigation</b> (BOI) was {{established}} in 1908, its head was called the Chief of the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Investigation.</b> It was changed to the Director of the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Investigation</b> in the term of William J. Flynn (1919-1921), and to its current name when the BOI was renamed FBI in 1935.|$|R
40|$|Depth <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> and {{vertical}} resolution values are determined and tabulated for 30 surface geoelectric arrays that have non-zero response, i. e., a depth <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> characteristic (DIC) function {{due to a}} buried thin horizontal sheet. In accord with experience, results show a general reciprocal relationship between depth <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> {{and vertical}} resolution. The most frequently used arrays in multi-electrode studies (i. e., Wenner-a, Wenner-b, Schlumberger, dipole-axial arrays and the pole-dipole array) offer reasonable compromises between depth <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> and vertical resolution. Depth <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> can be increased by using the pole-pole array; vertical resolution can be improved with, for example, the a 10 or c 10 arrays. Current focussing does not increase the depth <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> for the horizontal thin-sheet model. The complete set <b>of</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> and vertical resolution values permits exact physical comparison of various geoelectric arrays and provides simple but useful rules for practical geoelectric applications, e. g., how to develop multi-electrode systems with higher vertical resolution, or how to select arrays to satisfy special exploration requirements...|$|R
50|$|In response, {{congress}} filed House Bill No. 1162, {{from which}} Republic Act No. 157 originated. R.A. 157 {{was approved by}} Congress and enacted into law on 19 June 1947. Thus was born the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Investigation.</b> For all intents and purposes, the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Investigation</b> (BI) was patterned after the Federal Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Investigation</b> (FBI) in organization, functions and objectives. The FBI also evolved into its present size from humble beginnings as {{a division of the}} United States Department of Justice. The Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Investigation</b> created under R.A. 157 was later renamed the National Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Investigation</b> (NBI) by virtue of Executive Order No. 94, issued on 4 October 1947, by the late President Manuel A.

The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) jointly produced this report. It marked the end <b>of</b> <b>investigations</b> made under the operation regarding Savile alone.|$|E
5|$|Global News {{reporter}} Jennifer Tryon {{attempted to}} file a Freedom of Information request for documents on June 29, but was refused; an employee came out {{from the back of}} the offices, and turned the City Clerk's chair around, so that they couldn't respond. City officials then called the OPP. After the request, the city issued a two line statement that documents are now part <b>of</b> <b>investigations.</b> OPP noted that the documents are still available through Freedom of Information requests, and that the situation likely didn't warrant an emergency call to police. The reporter was provided a FOI application on police arrival, and told to ignore instructions from their superiors on calling police. Tryon, producer Kieron O'Dea and cameraman Trevor Owens would later receive a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Breaking National News Reportage at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards.|$|E
5|$|Hearings began September 27, 1918, {{shortly before}} the end of World War I. Nearly four dozen {{witnesses}} testified. Many were agents of the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Investigations</b> (BOI), the predecessor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The agents, controversially and usually erroneously, implicated high-profile American citizens as pro-German, using the fallacy of guilt by association. For example, the Bureau chief labeled some people pro-German because they had insubstantial and non-ideological acquaintance with German agents. Others were accused because their names were discovered in the notebooks of suspected German agents, of whom they had never heard.|$|E

In May 2014, the company pleaded guilty to decades of conspiring to help US citizens avoid taxes, and agreed to pay $2.6 billion in fines.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth in}} {{computer}} crime during the 1980s and 1990s caused {{law enforcement agencies}} to begin establishing specialized groups, usually at the national level, to handle the technical aspects <b>of</b> <b>investigations.</b> For example, in 1984 the FBI launched a Computer Analysis and Response Team and the following year a computer crime department was set up within the British Metropolitan Police fraud squad. As well as being law enforcement professionals, many of the early members of these groups were also computer hobbyists and became responsible for the field's initial research and direction.|$|E

40|$|Methods <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>of</b> crimes {{committed}} by juvenile (abstract) The purpose of my thesis is to describe and analyse juvenile delinquency and its methods <b>of</b> <b>investigation.</b> The reason why I chose this theme is that the juvenile delinquency is an up-to- date subject. Causes of a crime, ways of its commission and its prevention are frequent issues of general and expert public as well. The thesis is composed of eight chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects <b>of</b> methods <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>of</b> {{crimes committed}} by juvenile. Chapter One is introductory and defines the term methods <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> itself and its components. Chapter Two is subdivided into four parts. The first part defines the term juvenile. Part Two deals with main kinds of {{crimes committed by}} juvenile and compares statistical data. The following part of Chapter Two describes ways of committing crimes. The last part of Chapter One focuses on causes of crime and illustrates them. Chapter Three is concerned with specific clues and specific investigative situations. Chapter Four outlines specialities <b>of</b> object <b>of</b> <b>investigation,</b> specialities <b>of</b> suggestion <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> and specialities <b>of</b> early stage <b>of</b> <b>investigation.</b> Chapter Five mentions specialities of investigative versions.

5|$|After {{almost a}} year <b>of</b> <b>investigations</b> against Uli Hoeneß, Bayern's former player, former long-time general manager, and {{president}} at the time, {{he was convicted of}} tax evasion on 13 March 2014. Hoeneß resigned as president the next day, and Karl Hopfner was elected president on 2 May. Just days after Hoeneß conviction, on 25 March, Bayern won their 24th Bundesliga title by beating Hertha BSC 3–1 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. With seven matches remaining in the season, it was the earliest the championship had been won in Bundesliga history, breaking the record Bayern had set in the previous season. At {{the end of the season}} Bayern beat Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the 2014 DFB-Pokal Final to give the club the tenth league and cup double in its history. In 2014–15, Bayern defended their league title, and, the following season, won an 11th double, including a record fourth consecutive Bundesliga title. At the end of the 2015–16 season, Guardiola left Bayern to take over as manager of Manchester City and was replaced by Carlo Ancelotti.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of his exile, Zardari had several {{different}} legal problems. In Pakistan, Musharraf granted him amnesty for his alleged offences through the National Reconciliation Ordinance, drafted in October 2007. However, the ordinance faced mounting public pressure and an uncompromising judiciary. In addition, it only dealt with charges up to 1999. This left open the possibility <b>of</b> <b>investigations</b> into his alleged involvement in about $2 million in illegal kickbacks to Saddam Hussein, discovered in October 2005, under the oil-for-food program. If the ordinance was rescinded, {{he would have had to}} deal with charges relating to evading duties on an armoured BMW, commissions from a Polish tractor manufacturer, and a kickback from a gold bullion dealer. In Switzerland, Bhutto and Zardari appealed the 2003 Swiss conviction, which required the reopening of the case in October 2007. In November 2007, Swiss authorities returned the frozen $60 million to him through offshore companies because of the National Reconciliation Ordinance. In Spain, a criminal investigation was opened over the money laundering for the oil-for-food program because of the illicit profits handled through Spanish firms. In Britain, he was fighting a civil case against the Pakistani government for the proceeds from the liquidation sale of a Surrey mansion. He successfully used his medical diagnosis to postpone a verdict on his British manor trial.|$|E
