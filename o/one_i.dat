5|$|If I {{wanted to}} get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the <b>one</b> <b>I</b> would offer up. I think it's because it is to me the least flawed; let me put it that way. It is the most {{successful}} for what I tried to do. I succeeded more completely in my view with that than with anything else.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} a {{struggle}} telling this story over the years, {{because a lot of}} people don't want to hear about this kind of history. People don't relate to it, or just don't want to hear about it. But Mama told me to keep it alive, so I keep telling it... It's a sad story, but it's <b>one</b> <b>I</b> think everyone needs to hear.|$|E
5|$|Written and {{illustrated}} by Clamp, the stories of The <b>One</b> <b>I</b> Love appeared as a monthly serial in Monthly Young Rose from December 1993 to June 1995. Kadokawa Shoten collected the stories into a bound volume, and published it on July 16, 1995.|$|E

5|$|This <b>one</b> <b>I</b> had {{the most}} amount of input. I oversaw everything—the {{building}} of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody. Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind of like making a little movie. We basically sat down and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of {{and of all the}} things we wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat and the idea of Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E

25|$|The book is very interesting, but {{you still}} need more evidence. We don't regard it as an {{historical}} book, but as a narrative <b>one.</b> <b>I</b> {{want to see more}} proof. But at least Menzies has started something, and people could find more evidence.|$|E

Well, the cinematographer, in a sense, was right because I did not follow the conventions of film making that he had become accustomed to.|$|E

25|$|This case tho' {{depending}} upon a practice not common {{in this country}} {{is by no means a}} difficult <b>one.</b> <b>I</b> have no doubt but that the error complained of might have been corrected by the same court upon motion, at a subsequent term; but I should not for that reason reverse the judgment, since the party having preferred a writ of error coram vobis had a right to proceed in that way, tho' a shorter, and much less expensive mode might have been pursued.|$|E
25|$|So, {{while the}} name Packer appears {{many times in}} the book, the only serious comment that the writer makes about the whole affair (and he is right in his comment) is ”In one respect, and in only <b>one</b> <b>I</b> think, he (Packer) has done a service to the game by forcing us all to face the fact cricketers have been abysmally ill-paid.” So, as a whole “The Best Loved Game” is not about any {{controversial}} issue, it is simply about cricket being part of the English summer.|$|E
25|$|It {{was never}} a success financially. In fact, we lost money, if I {{remember}} correctly, on every single release bar <b>one.</b> <b>I</b> did quite like it but it was terribly indulgent. Not as indulgent {{as it would have}} been had I not had a business partner, admittedly... I liked having a label. It enabled you to put out stuff that you liked without, in those days, having to worry about whether it was going to work commercially. I've never been a good business man.|$|E
