5|$|The {{cinematography}} by William Lubtchansky furthers Rivette's {{interest in}} visual textures. The film's colour palette is largely natural, except for certain scenes—like the initial dream sequence—that are filmed in vivid colours. In {{the scene where}} Marie is arranging the attic room, the light changes—from shadow to warm light—just as she places an <b>oil</b> <b>lamp</b> on a stool to indicate that she has placed it correctly; this introduces a supernatural element that contrasts with the realism {{of the rest of}} the film.|$|E
5|$|It {{contained}} a mihrab ("niche indicating direction towards Mecca.") The maqam was noted by Guérin in 1863. Its eastern dome was {{constructed by the}} residents of Deir Ghassaneh, while local legend holds the western dome was completed by angels. The interior of the domes were simple and typical of most maqamat domes, lacking cross-vault roofing which was a common feature for most of Deir Ghassaneh's buildings. The sanctuary had a two-door entrance on its northern end. The interior walls were whitewashed, reflecting the Muslim tradition of heavenly light and spirit in the color white. A few verses from the Qur'an were written on parts of the walls. The tomb of al-Khawwas was covered in white cloth. A small niche on the western wall was fitted for an <b>oil</b> <b>lamp.</b>|$|E

50|$|Before the {{invention}} of electric lighting, candles and <b>oil</b> <b>lamps</b> were commonly used for illumination. In areas without electricity, they are still used routinely.

5|$|Living {{quarters}} for the senior officers consisted of eight separate well-furnished cabins, each {{provided with a}} small oak table and chair, an <b>oil</b> <b>lamp,</b> shelves and drawers and a canvas floor covering covered with a rug. The entire crew were given goat-skin mats to sleep on. Lighting for each living area was provided by small skylights in the deck above, which were covered by an iron hatch during battle. The officer's wardroom was located forward of the berth deck where officers would eat their meals, hold meetings or socialize during what little spare time they had. It was well furnished with an oriental rug, a large oak table and other such items. Ericsson had personally paid for the costs of all the officer's furnishings.|$|E
5|$|Chloe Frazer is Nathan Drake's other love interest. She {{appears in}} the second video game, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, where Claudia Black voiced the character. Black's {{interactions}} with Drake's voice actor Nolan North played {{a large role in}} developing the character. In Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Frazer begins as a business associate of Drake and Harry Flynn when a benefactor hires the group to steal an <b>oil</b> <b>lamp</b> from a Turkish museum. She and Drake had a romantic relationship sometime before the events of the game, which they covertly resume until Flynn betrays Drake and he ends up in a Turkish jail. Frazer bails him out and joins forces with Drake and Sullivan. She then begins traveling with Flynn and Lazarevic, acting as a double agent, and discovers that they are after the fabled city of Shambhala and the Cintamani stone, seeking immortality. Although her loyalties are called into question multiple times {{over the course of the}} game, she chooses to help Drake defeat Lazaravic in Shambhala. Her feelings for Drake are complicated, and she ends up voluntarily ending the relationship once she sees he is in love with Elena Fisher.|$|E
5|$|The Hindu elite {{follow the}} {{religious}} ideology of Shaiva Siddhanta (Shaiva school) while masses practice folk Hinduism, upholding {{their faith in}} local village deities not found in formal Hindu scriptures. The place of worship depends on the object of worship {{and how it is}} housed. It could be a proper Hindu temple known as a Koyil, constructed according to the Agamic scripts (a set of scriptures regulating the temple cult). More often, however, the temple is not completed in accordance with Agamic scriptures but consists of the barest essential structure housing a local deity. These temples observe daily Puja (prayers) hours and are attended by locals. Both types of temples have a resident ritualist or priest known as a Kurukkal. A Kurukkal may belong to someone from a prominent local lineage like Pandaram or Iyer community. In the Eastern Province, a Kurukkal usually belongs to Lingayat sect. Other places of worship do not have icons for their deities. The sanctum could house a trident (culam), a stone, or a large tree. Temples of this type are common in the Northern and Eastern Provinces; a typical village has up to 150 such structures. The offering would be done by an elder of the family who owns the site. A coconut <b>oil</b> <b>lamp</b> would be lit on Fridays, and a special rice dish known as pongal would be cooked either on a day considered auspicious by the family or on the Thai Pongal day, and possibly on Tamil New Year Day.|$|E

25|$|In Taoism, the Seven-Star Lamp qi xing deng 七星燈 is a seven-lamp <b>oil</b> <b>lamp</b> lit to {{represent}} the seven stars of the Northern Dipper. This lampstand is a requirement for all Taoist temples, never to be extinguished. In the first 9 days of the lunar 9th month festival, an <b>oil</b> <b>lamp</b> of nine connected lamps may also be lit to honour both the Northern Dipper and two other assistant stars (collectively known as the Nine Emperor Stars), sons of Dou Mu appointed by the Taoist Trinity (the Three Pure Ones) to hold the Books of Life and Death of humanity. The lamps represent the illumination of the 7 stars, and lighting them are believed to absolve sins while prolonging one's lifespan.|$|E

However, the three samples of <b>oil</b> <b>lamps</b> imitating the African ‘Atlante VIII’ are considered chemical outliers compared to the rest and are supposedly of foreign origin.

25|$|From its inception, the {{lighthouse}} was closely connected to Cape Cleveland Light.

25|$|A new {{lighting}} {{legislation was}} enacted in 1736, {{setting up a}} new kind of seal <b>oil</b> <b>lamp</b> giving a better light even during winter.

25|$|Wayang kulit is {{a unique}} form of theatre {{employing}} light and shadow. The puppets are crafted from buffalo hide and mounted on bamboo sticks. When held up behind a piece of white cloth, with an electric bulb or an <b>oil</b> <b>lamp</b> as the light source, shadows are cast on the screen. The plays are typically based on romantic tales and religious legends, especially adaptations of the classic Indian epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. Some of the plays are also based on local happening or other local secular stories.|$|E
50|$|More recent {{research}} disputes {{the interpretation of}} the cave as a Christian site. According to the latest evidence there were no Attic <b>oil</b> <b>lamps</b> with Christian designs until the fifth century. The small number of more sophisticated Christian <b>oil</b> <b>lamps</b> probably date to the sixth century. More importantly, the presence of Christian <b>oil</b> <b>lamps</b> does not imply the site was Christian. Elsewhere in the Roman Empire pagans used Christian <b>oil</b> <b>lamps</b> when non-Christian ones were not available. A remote cave like the one near Vari would have made a suitable location for continuing pagan religious practice in secret after the Empire started persecuting pagans. If Christians smashed the sculptures, it most likely happened {{at the end of the}} reoccupation rather than its beginning. Instead, it was possible that the pagan Platonists of late Roman Athens would have frequented the site due to its association with Plato.|$|R
