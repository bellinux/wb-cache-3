5|$|In 1993, Dr. Joe McInnis and Woodman {{organised}} {{an attempt}} to identify the priority targets from the year before. A chartered aircraft landed on the ice at three of the locations, a hole was drilled through the ice, and a small sector-scan sonar was used to image the sea bottom. Unfortunately, due to ice conditions and uncertain navigation, {{it was not possible}} to exactly confirm the locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes,</b> and nothing was found although hitherto-unknown depths were found at the locations that were consistent with Inuit testimony of the wreck.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E
5|$|While {{opening up}} the attic door, Kyle is seized by an {{attacker}} and killed. They {{find out that the}} killer is Billy Lenz's sister Agnes, who has also set up the corpses of the sorority sisters around a Christmas tree. After Leigh falls through the floor of the attic, Kelli is attacked by both Agnes and Billy. While fighting, the Christmas tree catches fire while she and Agnes fall down into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> in the wall. Managing to escape with Leigh's help, they set the house on fire and reach the hospital. At the hospital, Agnes, who had survived the fire, kills Leigh but Kelli manages to kill her using a defibrillator. When Billy chases her to the stairs, Kelli manages to knock him over, impaling him on the finial of a Christmas tree and finally killing him. She is last seen staring at Billy's corpse.|$|E

25|$|In a PNP transistor, the emitter–base {{region is}} forward biased, so holes are {{injected}} into the base as minority carriers. The base is very thin, and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> cross the reverse-biased base–collector junction to the collector.|$|E
25|$|Then {{the thermal}} {{conductivity}} of the porous phase (K'f) {{is related to}} the conductivity of the perfect phase (K'o, no porosity) by the following equation. Note that s is a term for the shape factor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|E
3000|$|As it is {{seen from}} the graphs, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{screening}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> is larger in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smaller electron velocity 1 a.u. in Figure 3 a.

25|$|Tsujita and Westermann {{defended the}} idea of {{punctured}} ammonite shells as mosasaur prey in a contrarian position to the several 1998 papers that doubted this hypothesis. Based on a survey of Placenticeras shells from the Bearpaw Formation of Alberta, they concluded that the arrangements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> were too similar to the placement of teeth in a mosasaur's jaw to be the chance result of limpet activity. Their doubts were bolstered by the disparity of abundance in the relevant rocks between the scarce limpet shells and the frequent occurrence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> themselves. According to Tsujita and Westermann, the previous attempts to test {{the effect of a}} mosasaur bite on a shell experimentally with a simulated jaw assumed an overly simplistic interpretation of mosasaur feeding behavior, so its failure to replicate the shell punctures still did not discredit their putative mosasaurian origins.|$|E
25|$|At {{seven points}} {{along the length of}} the boat, {{thickness}} gauges were cut, usually at the bottom of the boat. Those holes were bored from outside the log after the outside of the boat was formed. The depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> equated to the required thickness of the boat bottom. In the Hasholme logboat, however, the thickness gauges were bored not at the bottom but at the turn of the bilge, and later corked by oak tree-nails.|$|E

25|$|Metals are {{typically}} isotropic, and an ordinary twist drill bit shears <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> cleanly. Wood drilled {{across the grain}} has long strands of wood fiber. These long strands tend to pull out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood <b>hole,</b> rather than being cleanly cut at <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> edge. <b>The</b> lip and spur drill bit has <b>the</b> outside corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cutting edges leading, so that it cuts <b>the</b> periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> before <b>the</b> inner parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cutting edges plane off <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b> By cutting <b>the</b> periphery first, the lip maximizes the chance that the fibers can be cut cleanly, rather than having them pull messily out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> timber.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gimlet bit {{acts as a}} tapered screw, to {{draw the}} bit into the wood and to begin forcing aside the wood fibers, without {{necessarily}} cutting them.

25|$|The actual {{physical}} evidence of Paleolithic shelters {{is limited to}} permanent materials like stone and bone. No wooden post or animal hide has been found, because these materials disintegrate {{over the course of}} time. But the existence of the perishable elements can be established. Postholes prove the existence of the wooden supports. The alignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> or a circle of support stones describes a footprint of a framework. The area covered by flint scattered from blade work, and other household activities, further demarcates the interior shape of the structure.|$|E

25|$|Unlike many flutes, ocarinas do {{not rely}} on pipe length to produce a {{particular}} tone. Instead the tone {{is dependent on the}} ratio of the total surface area of opened holes to the total cubic volume enclosed by the instrument. This means that, unlike a flute or recorder, sound is created by resonance of the entire cavity and the placement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> on an ocarina is largely irrelevant – their size is the most important factor. Instruments that have toneholes close to the voicing/embouchure should be avoided, however; as an ocarina is a Helmholtz resonator, this weakens tonal production.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} {{manufacturing}} tools {{for the use}} of extracting for western lowland gorillas, gorillas are able to adapt tools to a particular use by selecting branches, removing projections such as leaves and bark and adapting their length to the depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes.</b> It appears that they also anticipate the use of the tool since they begin with biggest sticks available and progressively modify it until it is the perfect fit for inserting into a hole that contains food. This demonstrates the gorillas' acquisition of high level sensorimotor intelligence similar to that of young human children.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the food}} items of mosasaurs were ammonites, {{molluscs}} with shells {{similar to those of}} Nautilus, which were abundant in the Cretaceous seas. Holes have been found in fossil shells of some ammonites, mainly Pachydiscus and Placenticeras. These were once interpreted as a result of limpets attaching themselves to the ammonites, but the triangular shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes,</b> their size, and their presence {{on both sides of the}} shells, corresponding to upper and lower jaws, is evidence of the bite of medium-sized mosasaurs. Whether this behaviour was common across all size classes of mosasaurs is not clear.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{ground state}} <b>of</b> an acceptor-bound {{hole in a}} zinc-blende {{semiconductor}} is formed by four eigenstates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total angular momentum, which is a vector sum of spin and orbital moment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b> As a result, <b>the</b> hyperfine interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> with lattice nuclei becomes anisotropic and coordinate-dependent.

40|$|We {{report on}} <b>the</b> {{temporal}} evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> percussion drilling process in deep laser drilling.

We investigate <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> processing parameters fluence and pulse energy on the depth and shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> demonstrating different phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drilling process. In the first phase, a tapered hole is formed with highly reproducible shape and depth. In the following, <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> shape is irregular and imperfections like bulges, changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drilling direction and <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> multiple <b>hole</b> ends occur. In the final phase, the maximum depth stays constant while the volume still increases due to enlargement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> diameter and <b>the</b> possible formation <b>of</b> multiple hole ends. Deviations from <b>the</b> ideal <b>hole</b> shape occur primarily in <b>the</b> lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b> Their extent can be reduced by increasing <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> applied pulse energy.

40|$|This is a historical-critical study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> argument, {{concentrating on}} the {{interface}} between historical, philosophical and physical issues. Although it includes a review of its history, its primary aim is a discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contemporary implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> argument for physical theories based on dynamical, background-independent space-time structures. The historical review includes Einstein’s formulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> argument, Kretschmann’s critique, as well as Hilbert’s reformulation and Darmois’ formulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general-relativistic Cauchy problem. The 1970 s saw a revival <b>of</b> interest in <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> argument, growing out of attempts to answer the question: Why did three years elapse between Einstein’s adoption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metric tensor to represent the gravitational field and his adoption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Einstein field equations? The main part presents some modern mathematical versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> argument, including both coordinate-dependent and coordinate-independent definitions of covariance and general covariance; and the fiber bundle formulation of both natural and gauge natural theories.
