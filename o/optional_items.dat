2500|$|The Rally GT and the Rally SST did not {{disappear}} completely this year; {{this can be}} described that they were downgraded from being trim levels to optional packages that were offered by several VAM dealerships.

2500|$|The first, most casual, {{and most}} usual way {{the game is}} played among {{individual}} gamers not involved in regular group play is what's called the [...] "pick-up game".

In the pick-up game each player or team is given a certain number of BPV (casually referred to as [...] "points") to [...] "buy" [...] the starships they will play. There are also <b>optional</b> <b>items</b> of equipment available to certain races/ships that can also be [...] "bought" [...] and added to the player's order of battle (including sundries such as improved drones or fire control, mines, extra boarding parties, multirole shuttles or fighters, etc.).

All players must agree on entry conditions for their forces (weapons status, hexes of first appearance, presence of [...] "terrain" [...] such as asteroid fields or minefields) and the [...] "ground rules" [...] that will be in effect during play (mainly which optional rules will or will not be used; mainly electronic warfare or mid-turn speed changes). Typically victory in the pick-up game demands simple destruction of the enemy (or enemies depending on the number of sides in play) but players may devise other victory conditions by mutual consent.|$|E
