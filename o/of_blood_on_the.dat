5|$|Before the {{understudy}} rehearsal, Jim's fiancée Laura (the understudy for Lady Macbeth) {{helps him}} learn lines in Tony's dressing room. Company manager Felicity arrives and scolds them {{for using the}} room. While Jim is absent, Felicity flirts with Laura. Laura asks Tony's dresser, Kirstie, what he earns, before opening Tony's payslip to see for herself. She is determined for Jim to appear as Macbeth, which {{would allow them to}} save for their wedding. Laura cuts herself on a pin that Kirstie left in the Lady Macbeth dress, and after she and Kirstie leave the room, Jim sees a drop <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor grow into a large puddle. When he looks again, it has gone.|$|E
5|$|The {{forensic}} {{examination of}} the lead pipes found {{at the murder scene}} and in the Corsair's boot revealed traces <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pipe from 46Lower Belgrave Street. This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan's (blood group A) and Sandra Rivett's (B) blood. Hair belonging to Veronica Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Sandra Rivett. The pipe found inside the car had neither blood nor hair on it. Home Office scientists were unable to prove conclusively that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely. The tape wrapped around both was similar, but those too could not be conclusively linked. The letters written to Bill Shand-Kydd were stained with blood considered to be from both women. The letter to Michael Stoop had no blood on it, but it was later proven that the paper it was written on had been torn from a writing pad found in the Corsair's boot.|$|E
5|$|On December 23, Flood {{ordered an}} {{examination}} of Mary Celeste, which {{was carried out by}} John Austin, Surveyor of Shipping, with the assistance of a diver, Ricardo Portunato. Austin noted cuts {{on each side of the}} bow, caused, he thought, by a sharp instrument, and found possible traces <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> captain's sword. His report emphasized that the ship did not appear to have been struck by heavy weather, citing a phial of sewing machine oil found upright in its place. Austin did not acknowledge that the phial might have been replaced since the abandonment, nor did the court raise this point. Portunato's report on the hull concluded that the ship had not been involved in a collision or run aground. A further inspection by a group of Royal Naval captains endorsed Austin's opinion that the cuts on the bow had been caused deliberately. They also discovered stains on one of the ship's rails that might have been blood, together with a deep mark possibly caused by an axe. These findings strengthened Flood's suspicions that human wrongdoing rather than natural disaster lay behind the mystery. On January 22, 1873, he sent the reports to the Board of Trade in London, adding his own conclusion that the crew had got at the alcohol (he ignored its non-potability) and murdered the Briggs family and the ship's officers in a drunken frenzy. They had cut the bows to simulate a collision, then fled in the yawl to suffer an unknown fate. Flood thought that Morehouse and his men were hiding something, specifically that Mary Celeste had been abandoned in a more easterly location, and that the log had been doctored. He could not accept that Mary Celeste could have traveled so far while unmanned.|$|E

Working with Hitchcock's editor George Tomasini, he edited this footage following the storyboards to show Hitchcock how the scene could work. In the end, Hitchcock gave his approval but, according to Kirkham, made two additions: a spray <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chest of Marion Crane/Janet Leigh as she slides down the tiles, and a close-up of her belly getting stabbed.|$|E
25|$|Police officer Robert Riske was {{the first}} officer at the crime scene.

He next saw Goldman's body a short {{distance}} away, lying on its side beside a tree and off the walkway. Riske said he saw a white envelope, which was later found to contain the glasses left at the restaurant by Brown's mother. He also saw Goldman's beeper, a black leather glove, and a dark blue knit ski cap on the ground near the bodies. The front door of Brown's house was wide open, but there were no signs of forced entry nor any evidence that anyone had entered the premises. Nothing inside was out of the ordinary.|$|E
25|$|Several {{hours later}} at 9.30 a.m., the {{mutilated}} bodies of Robb and McIlwaine were discovered lying in pools <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roadside 100 metres apart {{from one another}} by a woman taking her children to dancing lessons. Because of the devastating stab wounds inflicted upon the teenagers, the RUC had assumed that McIlwaine had received a shotgun blast to his face. Both of their throats were slashed so deeply that the teenagers were nearly decapitated. The RUC immediately set up an inquiry into the killings. Post mortems revealed that Robb had sustained a severe cut throat injury to the neck and a penetrating wound to the abdomen with three penetrating wounds. There were no defence injuries. McIlwaine received a severe cut throat injury, seven penetrating wounds to the chest and penetrating wounds to the face {{and to the left}} eye. Both teenagers were intoxicated {{at the time of their}} deaths.|$|E

But there was a tremendous amount <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left-hand side and {{at the back of the}} head." [...] This suggested to Altgens that the gunshots came from the rear, because he should have seen some evidence otherwise. He also remembered seeing Jackie Kennedy on the trunk of the limousine, and thinking that she was frightened by the events and was trying to get away.|$|E
500|$|Another {{component}} of the ritual is the slaughter of water buffalo. The more powerful the person who died, the more buffalo are slaughtered at the death feast. Buffalo carcasses, including their heads, are usually lined up on a field waiting for their owner, {{who is in the}} [...] "sleeping stage". Torajans believe that the deceased will need the buffalo to make the journey and that they will be quicker to arrive at Puya if they have many buffalo. Slaughtering tens of water buffalo and hundreds of pigs using a machete is the climax of the elaborate death feast, with dancing and music and young boys who catch spurting blood in long bamboo tubes. Some of the slaughtered animals are given by guests as [...] "gifts", which are carefully noted because they will be considered debts of the deceased's family. However, a cockfight, known as bulangan londong, {{is an integral part of}} the ceremony. As with the sacrifice of the buffalo and the pigs, the cockfight is considered sacred because it involves the spilling <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> earth. In particular, the tradition requires the sacrifice of at least three chickens. However, it is common for at least 25 pairs of chickens to be set against each other in the context of the ceremony.|$|E

[...] By 1:44a.m. all was quiet until a plane flew over the city at 3:39a.m. Neighbors took to their roofs and watched as American special forces stormed the compound. One neighbor said, [...] "I saw soldiers emerging from the helicopters and advancing towards the house. Some of them instructed us in chaste Pashto {{to turn off the}} lights and stay inside."

500|$|In 2008, {{the musicians}} of OverClocked ReMix {{were chosen to}} handle the Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix soundtrack after Capcom U.S.A. {{associate}} producer Rey Jimenez heard the site's 2006 Super Street Fighter II Turbo tribute album Blood on the Asphalt. Entitled OC ReMix: Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix Official Soundtrack, the complete 66-track album was freely released at OverClocked ReMix. The album includes new arrangements, edited versions <b>of</b> <b>Blood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Asphalt tracks, and other prior remixes from the site. The remixers arranged the music based on knowledge of the Street Fighter II series alone, as the music for the game was completed before the visuals and gameplay. OC ReMix founder David [...] "djpretzel" [...] Lloyd directed the soundtrack and served as the organization's contact with Capcom [...] "to ensure that working with a large fan community {{was as close as}} possible for Capcom to working with a single composer". Jimenez praised HD Remixs music as [...] "above and beyond our expectations" [...] and OC ReMix's efforts as [...] "one of the most rewarding aspects of working on SF HD Remix". Capcom's then-Vice-President of Strategic Planning & Business Development, Christian Svensson, described the soundtrack as [...] "impactful" [...] and claimed in an interview that in demos of the game the remixed music was praised before any other aspect. In its review of HD Remix, IGN commended OC ReMix's work as [...] "a great tribute to the original soundtrack".
