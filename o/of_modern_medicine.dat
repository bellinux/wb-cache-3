5|$|In 1930, Downes' son John, then in {{his first}} year as a boarder at Geelong Grammar School, fell seriously ill with meningitis. Despite the best efforts of two eminent medical practitioners, Dr Keith Fairley and Dr Reginald Webster, John succumbed to {{toxaemia}} and died in 1933, at the age of 10. The failure <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>medicine</b> to save his son affected Downes deeply, and led him to abandon his medical career in favour of a military one.|$|E
5|$|The {{legacy of}} the herbal extends beyond {{medicine}} to botany and horticulture. Herbal medicine is still practiced {{in many parts of}} the world but the traditional grand herbal, as described here, ended with the European Renaissance, the rise <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>medicine</b> and the use of synthetic and industrialized drugs. The medicinal component of herbals has developed in several ways. Firstly, discussion of plant lore was reduced and with the increased medical content there emerged the official pharmacopoeia. The first British Pharmacopoeia was published in the English language in 1864, but gave such general dissatisfaction both to the medical profession and to chemists and druggists that the General Medical Council brought out a new and amended edition in 1867. Secondly, at a more popular level, there are the books on culinary herbs and herb gardens, medicinal and useful plants. Finally, the enduring desire for simple medicinal information on specific plants has resulted in contemporary herbals that echo the herbals of the past, an example being Maud Grieve's A Modern Herbal, first published in 1931 but with many subsequent editions.|$|E

25|$|Adler (1995) cautioned {{the failure}} <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>medicine</b> to {{implement}} the biopsychosocial model, which incorporates all aspects of a patient’s experience in a scientific approach into the clinical picture, often results in chronically-ill patients deferring to non-traditional and alternative forms of therapy, seeking {{to be understood as}} a whole, not a part, which may be problematic among patients with FSS.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{advancement}} <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>medicine,</b> acute kidney injury {{was referred to}} as uremic poisoning while uremia was contamination of the blood with urine.

25|$|Transplantation {{medicine}} {{is one of}} the most challenging and complex areas <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>medicine.</b> Some of the key areas for medical management are the problems of transplant rejection, during which the body has an immune response to the transplanted organ, possibly leading to transplant failure and the need to immediately remove the organ from the recipient. When possible, transplant rejection can be reduced through serotyping to determine the most appropriate donor-recipient match and through the use of immunosuppressant drugs.|$|E
25|$|Situs inversus (also called situs transversus or oppositus) is a {{congenital}} {{condition in}} which the major visceral organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions. The normal arrangement of internal organs is known as situs solitus while situs inversus is generally the mirror image of situs solitus. Although cardiac problems are more common than in the general population, most people with situs inversus have no medical symptoms or complications resulting from the condition, and until the advent <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>medicine</b> it was usually undiagnosed.|$|E

25|$|In the UK, scepticism {{about food}} {{intolerance}} {{as a specific}} condition influenced doctors' (GPs') perceptions of patients and of the patients' underlying problems. However, rather than risk damaging the doctor-patient relationship, GPs chose - despite their scepticism and guided by an element of awareness of the limitations <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>medicine</b> - to negotiate mutually acceptable ground with patients and with patients' beliefs. As a result, whether due to a placebo effect, a secondary benefit, or a biophysical result of excluding a food from the diet, the GPs acknowledge both personal and therapeutic benefits.|$|E
25|$|Finland’s {{journey to}} a welfare {{state has been}} long, from a very modest start. The history <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>medicine</b> in Finland can be {{considered}} to have begun at 1640 when the first university of Finland, The Royal Academy of Turku, was established. At the time Finland {{was a part of}} the Swedish Empire. As the field of medicine did not enjoy very high status in society at the time, the importance of trained medical faculty remained low for a long time. Until 1750, the professor of medicine was the only trained medical doctor in Finland.|$|E
25|$|Suspicion <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>medicine</b> due to {{beliefs about}} illness being due to {{witchcraft}} also continues {{in many countries}} to this day, with tragic healthcare consequences. HIV/AIDS and Ebola virus disease are two examples of often-lethal infectious disease epidemics whose medical care and containment has been severely hampered by regional beliefs in witchcraft. Other severe medical conditions whose treatment is hampered in this way include tuberculosis, leprosy, epilepsy and the common severe bacterial Buruli ulcer. Public healthcare often requires considerable education work related to epidemology and modern health knowledge {{in many parts of}} the world where belief in witchcraft prevails, to encourage effective preventive health measures and treatments, to reduce victim blaming, shunning and stigmatization, and to prevent the killing of people and endangering of animal species for body parts believed to convey magical abilities.|$|E

25|$|Serpents are {{connected}} with poison and medicine. The snake's venom {{is associated with}} the chemicals of plants and fungi that have the power to either heal, poison or provide expanded consciousness (and even the elixir of life and immortality) through divine intoxication. Because of its herbal knowledge and entheogenic association the snake was often considered one of the wisest animals, being (close to the) divine. Its divine aspect combined with its habitat in the earth between the roots of plants made it an animal with chthonic properties connected to the afterlife and immortality. Asclepius, the god of medicine and healing, carried a staff with one serpent wrapped around it, which has become the symbol <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>medicine.</b> Moses also had a replica of a serpent on a pole, the Nehushtan, mentioned in Numbers 21:8.|$|E
25|$|In the 1500s, Paracelsus was {{probably}} the first to criticize Galen publicly. Also in the 16th century, scientist and artist Leonardo da Vinci compared metabolism to a burning candle. Leonardo did not publish his works on this subject, {{but he was not}} afraid of thinking for himself and he definitely disagreed with Galen. Ultimately, 16th century works of Andreas Vesalius, sometimes called the father <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>medicine,</b> overturned Galen's ideas. He was followed by piercing thought amalgamated with the era's mysticism and religion sometimes fueled by the mechanics of Newton and Galileo. Jan Baptist van Helmont, who discovered several gases such as carbon dioxide, performed the first quantitative experiment. Robert Boyle advanced chemistry. Sanctorius measured body weight. Physician Herman Boerhaave modeled the digestive process. Physiologist Albrecht von Haller worked out the difference between nerves and muscles.|$|E
25|$|If herd {{immunity}} {{has been established}} and maintained in a population for a sufficient time, the disease is inevitably eliminated—no more endemic transmissions occurs. If elimination is achieved worldwide {{and the number of}} cases is permanently reduced to zero, then a disease can be declared eradicated. Eradication can thus be considered the final effect or end-result of public health initiatives to control the spread of infectious disease. The benefits of eradication include ending all morbidity and mortality caused by the disease, financial savings for individuals, health care providers, and governments, and enabling resources used to control the disease to be used elsewhere. To date, two diseases have been eradicated using {{herd immunity}} and vaccination: rinderpest and smallpox. Eradication efforts that rely on herd immunity are currently underway for poliomyelitis, though civil unrest and distrust <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>medicine</b> have made this difficult. Voluntary vaccination, for a variety of reasons, may be an obstacle to eradication if not enough people become immune to a disease.|$|E
25|$|As Joseph E. Inikori argues, {{the history}} of the region shows that the effects were still quite deleterious. He argues that the African {{economic}} model of the period was very different from the European model, and could not sustain such population losses.

Inikori also notes that after the suppression of the slave trade Africa's population almost immediately began to rapidly increase, even prior to the introduction <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>medicines.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of Artificial Intelligence {{to the field}} of Medical Sciences considerably enhanced the field of researches.
