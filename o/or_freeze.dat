5|$|Gameplay {{remained}} largely similar to Press Your Luck, with contestants accumulating cash and prizes {{and attempting to}} avoid landing on a Whammy, who took away the winnings of any contestant who landed on it. At {{the start of the}} game, each of the three contestants was spotted $1,000 and took turns taking one spin at a time on the board. After each cycle of spins, additional Whammies were added to the board replacing cash values or prizes, and contestants chose to spin again <b>or</b> <b>freeze</b> with their score at that point. Landing on a Whammy in round one reduced that contestant's score to $0 and eliminated that contestant from further play in the round. Play continued until all three contestants froze or hit a Whammy. Cash values ranged from $100–$1,500 in round one, and prizes of similar values also appeared.|$|E
25|$|Lyophilization, <b>or</b> <b>freeze</b> drying, is {{a process}} that removes water from a liquid drug {{creating}} a solid powder, or cake. The lyophilized product is stable for extended periods of time and could allow storage at higher temperatures. In protein formulations, stabilizers are added to replace the water and preserve the structure of the molecule.|$|E
25|$|Although Windows 9x {{features}} memory protection, it {{does not}} protect the first megabyte of memory from userland applications. This area of memory contains code critical to {{the functioning of the}} operating system, and by writing into this area of memory an application can crash <b>or</b> <b>freeze</b> the operating system. This was a source of instability as faulty applications could accidentally write into this region and with that halt the operating system.|$|E

25|$|Male {{pink salmon}} and some sockeye salmon develop {{pronounced}} humps {{just before they}} spawn. These humps may have evolved because they confer species advantages. The humps make it less likely the salmon will spawn in the shallow water at margins of the streambed, which tend to dry out during low water flows <b>or</b> <b>freeze</b> in winter. Further, riffles can contain many salmon spawning simultaneously, as in {{the image on the}} right. Predators, such as bears, {{will be more likely to}} catch the more visually prominent humped males, with their humps projecting above the surface of the water. This may provide a protective buffer for the females.|$|E
25|$|Most bugs {{arise from}} {{mistakes}} and errors made {{in either a}} program's source code or its design, or in components and operating systems used by such programs. A few are caused by compilers producing incorrect code. A program that contains {{a large number of}} bugs, and/or bugs that seriously interfere with its functionality, is said to be buggy (defective). Bugs can trigger errors that may have ripple effects. Bugs may have subtle effects or cause the program to crash <b>or</b> <b>freeze</b> the computer. Other bugs qualify as security bugs and might, for example, enable a malicious user to bypass access controls in order to obtain unauthorized privileges.|$|E
25|$|The goaltender {{has special}} {{privileges}} and training that other players do not. He or she wears special goaltending equipment {{that is different}} from that worn by other players and is subject to specific regulations. Goalies may use any part of their bodies to block shots. The goalie may legally hold (<b>or</b> <b>freeze)</b> the puck with his hands to cause a stoppage of play. If a player from the other team hits the goaltender without making an attempt to get out of his way, the offending player may be penalized. In some leagues (including the NHL), if a goalie's stick breaks, he can continue playing with a broken stick until the play is stopped, unlike other players who must drop any broken sticks immediately.|$|E

50|$|Neurolysis may {{refer to}} the {{application}} of physical agents (heat <b>or</b> <b>freezing)</b> <b>or</b> chemicals (such as phenol, alcohol or glycerol) to a nerve to cause the temporary degeneration of the nerve's fibers in order to interrupt the transmission of nerve signals, usually for pain relief (a neurolytic block). Some authors use the term to denote just chemical neurolytic blocks, and use neurotomy to refer to neurolytic block by heat <b>or</b> <b>freezing.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{phase diagram}} {{explains}} why liquids {{do not exist}} in space or any other vacuum. Since the pressure is zero (except on surfaces or interiors of planets and moons) water and other liquids exposed to space will either immediately boil <b>or</b> <b>freeze</b> depending on the temperature. In regions of space near the earth, water will freeze if the sun is not shining directly on it and vapourize (sublime) {{as soon as it}} is in sunlight. If water exists as ice on the moon, it can only exist in shadowed holes where the sun never shines and where the surrounding rock doesn't heat it up too much. At some point near the orbit of Saturn, the light from the sun is too faint to sublime ice to water vapour. This is evident from the longevity of the ice that composes Saturn's rings.|$|E
500|$|One support item {{can be used}} each turn, {{including}} {{items that}} restore health or provide beneficial status effects that improve the character's abilities. Weapons and armor can be enhanced using optional [...] "strap-ons", such as fake vampire teeth, bubble gum, or a Jewpacabra claw. These items can cause enemies to bleed and lose health, weaken enemy armor, boost player health or steal health from opponents, and disgust foes to make them [...] "grossed out" [...] and cause them to vomit. Additionally, the [...] "strap-ons" [...] can set opponents on fire, electrocute them, <b>or</b> <b>freeze</b> them. Some enemies are immune {{to one or more}} of these effects. Enemies can deflect certain attacks entirely; those in a riposte stance will deflect any melee attack, requiring the use of ranged weapons, while those in reflect stance will deflect ranged weapons.|$|E
2500|$|Bermuda has a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Köppen Cfa). Bermuda is warmed by the nearby Gulf Stream, and low latitude.

[...] With rim brakes, the first point that mud builds up on a mountain bike ridden in thick mud is usually the brakes. [...] A mountain bicycle with disc brakes is [...] less susceptible to mud buildup provided the rear frame and front fork yoke have sufficient clearance from the wheels.|$|E
2500|$|The {{coast of}} California has a Mediterranean climate. Daily high {{temperatures}} range from 70 to 80°F (21 to 27°C) {{in the summer}} to 50 to 65°F (10 to 16°C) in winter, with low temperatures from the 60°F (16°C)s in summer to the mid 40s F in winter[...] Like most Mediterranean climates, much of coastal California has a wet winter and dry summer. Early summers can often bring cool, overcast weather (fog and low stratus clouds) to coastal California. As such, the warmest summer weather is delayed until August, even September {{in many areas of}} the California coast; on average, September is the warmest month in San Francisco, CA. Upwelling of cold Pacific waters also contributes to the frequent cool spring and early summer weather in coastal California. In California's inland river valleys (Bakersfield, Sacramento areas), the wet-winter, dry-summer pattern remains, but winters are cooler and more prone to occasional frost <b>or</b> <b>freeze,</b> while summers are much hotter, with blazing sunshine and daytime high temperatures not uncommonly in the 90s °F to over 100°F (38°C).|$|E

2500|$|Robert C. Bolles (1970), a {{researcher}} at University of Washington, wanted to understand species-specific defense reactions and avoidance learning among animals, but found that the theories of avoidance learning and the tools {{that were used to}} measure this tendency were {{out of touch with the}} natural world. He theorized the species-specific defense reaction (SSDR). There are three forms of SSDRs: flight, fight (pseudo-aggression), <b>or</b> <b>freeze.</b> Even domesticated animals have SSDRs, and in those moments it is seen that animals revert to atavistic standards and become [...] "wild" [...] again. Dr. Bolles states that responses are often dependent on the reinforcement of a safety signal, and not the aversive conditioned stimuli. This safety signal can be a source of feedback or even stimulus change. Intrinsic feedback or information coming from within, muscle twitches, increased heart rate, is seen to be more important in SSRDs than extrinsic feedback, stimuli that comes from the external environment. Dr. Bolles found that most creatures have some intrinsic set of fears, to help assure survival of the species. Rats will run away from any shocking event, and pigeons will flap their wings harder when threatened, the wing flapping in pigeons and the scattered running of rats are considered a species-specific defense reaction or behavior. Bolles believed that SSDR are conditioned through pavlovian conditioning, and not operant conditioning; SSDR arise from the association between the environmental stimuli and adverse events. Michael S. Fanselow conducted an experiment, to test some specific defense reactions, he observed that rats in two different shock situations responded differently, based on instinct or defensive topography, rather than contextual information.|$|E
