25|$|In 1974 Skempton and Michael Parsons {{formed a}} duo {{to perform their}} own works. The 1980s saw an {{increase}} of interest in Skempton's music, which led to more commissions and permitted him to compose more for larger forces. Lento, an orchestral work composed in late 1991, became one of Skempton's most widely recognised pieces. In the 1990s important recordings of his works started appearing, such as a disc of piano music recorded by his old friend and former Scratch Orchestra colleague John Tilbury, released on Sony Classical in 1996, and Surface Tension, a recording of miscellaneous works released <b>on</b> <b>Mode</b> Records.|$|E
500|$|Another feature {{peculiar}} to waveguide filters {{is that there}} is a definite frequency, the cutoff frequency, below which no transmission can take place. [...] This means that in theory low-pass filters cannot be made in waveguides. [...] However, designers frequently take a lumped element low-pass filter design and convert it to a waveguide implementation. [...] The filter is consequently low-pass by design and may be considered a low-pass filter for all practical purposes if the cutoff frequency is below any frequency of interest to the application. [...] The waveguide cutoff frequency is a function of transmission mode, so at a given frequency, the waveguide may be usable in some modes but not others. [...] Likewise, the guide wavelength (λg) and characteristic impedance (Z0) of the guide at a given frequency also depend <b>on</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E

Their IFF systems responded negatively to {{the attempt to}} identify the contact <b>on</b> <b>Mode</b> I. The Mode IV momentarily gave a positive response, but thereafter responded negatively and the F-15s moved to intercept the unidentified aircraft. Intermittent IFF Mode I and Mode II returns from the Black Hawks now began to show on Wilson's and other AWACS crew members' scopes and friendly helicopter symbols reappeared on Wang's scope. After closing to [...] of the radar contacts, at 10:25 the F-15s again reported the contact to the AWACS and Wilson this time responded that he now had a radar contact at that reported location. Although the Black Hawk intermittent radar and now steady IFF returns on the AWACS scopes {{were in the same}} location as the unidentified contacts being tracked by the F-15s, none of the AWACS controllers advised Wickson or May that the contacts they were tracking might be friendly helicopters.|$|E

2500|$|Jaime Reyes {{appears in}} , voiced by Eric Lopez. He {{appears as a}} member of the Young Justice team. Jaime {{believes}} the Scarab to be a piece of technology created by Ted Kord prior to the former Blue Beetle's death at the hands of The Light. In [...] "Before the Dawn", a flashback reveals that one night, an explosion in Kord Industries released the Scarab who bonded with Jaime as he was passing by. Unlike other versions, the Scarab speaks to Jaime only in English and finds lethal courses of action preferable to capture and restraint, which is why Jaime is constantly at odds with it. Unlike his comic book counterpart, he does not experience any discomfort when transforming into Blue Beetle. When Impulse liberates Jaime from the Reach's first attempts to control him, he tells Jaime why he had come to the past in the first place: in his time, Jaime's Scarab would have become <b>on</b> <b>mode</b> and he becomes Earth's dictator. Jaime refuses to believe this, but is still dazed from the experiments. Blue Beetle's Scarab and body are eventually put under full Reach control by Green Beetle, a Green Martian agent of the Reach who wears the same type of Reach armor as Jaime. This virtually trapped Jaime in his mind, and allowed the Reach to make Jaime turn on the rest of the Team against his own will. The Team, mainly Zatanna, later frees Blue Beetle and his Scarab from the Reach's control. He then goes on to play an important role in helping to defeat Black Beetle, another armor-wielding Reach agent, and save the world from the Reach's attempt to destroy it.|$|E
