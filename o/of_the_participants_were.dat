5|$|MOHH {{may have}} been the first hip-hop dance {{convention}}, {{but it is not the}} only one that exists. Urban Dance Camp (UDC) is a six-week-long German-based dance convention held every year in Lörrach, a small town on the border of France and Switzerland. In a report on the event by a local paper, Bettina Kraft, the manager of UDC, estimated that 85% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> from outside of Germany. In 2009 Kraft created Urban Dance Showcase, a parallel event to UDC reserved only for performances by professional choreographers, dance crews, and UDC teachers. Dancers such as Shaun Evaristo, Les Twins, I.aM.mE, b-boy Lilou, and b-boy Hong 10 have performed at the showcase in the past.|$|E
5|$|The Monbar Hotel {{attack was}} carried out by the GAL, a state-sponsored death squad, on 25 September 1985 in Bayonne, France. The targets were four members of ETA military, whom the Spanish {{government}} believed to be senior figures in the organisation, itself proscribed as a terrorist group in Spain and France. All four people were killed, with a fifth person, apparently unconnected to ETA, injured in the shooting. This represented the deadliest attack carried out by the GAL. Although two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> apprehended shortly after the shooting, controversy surrounded the possible involvement of senior figures in the Spanish police.|$|E
5|$|This {{came to a}} head at {{a meeting}} {{sponsored}} by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Oxford in 1981. The methodologies and research questions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes. Nevertheless, the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world. The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research, which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies, archaeoastronomers seek to explain why people would have an interest in the night sky.|$|E

25|$|Prefixes are {{mutually}} exclusive and are {{selected based on}} the following rule: if one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>is</b> second person, <b>the</b> second person prefix is used; if not, if one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first person, then the first person prefix is used; if none of these applies, other forms, if they take a prefix, take the third person prefix. This is the well-known Algonquian 2-1-3 precedence rule.|$|R

5|$|After Climbié's death, {{the parties}} {{involved}} in her case were widely criticised. A public inquiry, headed by Lord Laming, was ordered. It discovered numerous instances where Climbié could have been saved, noted {{that many of the}} organisations involved in her care were badly run, and discussed the racial aspects surrounding the case, as many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> black. The subsequent report by Laming made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England. Climbié's death was largely responsible for the formation of the Every Child Matters initiative; the introduction of the Children Act 2004; the creation of the ContactPoint project, a government database designed to hold information on all children in England (now defunct after closure by the government of 2010); and the creation of the Office of the Children's Commissioner chaired by the Children's Commissioner for England.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Morrissey {{developed}} a filmmaking craft at the Rathbone Theatre Workshop, a Youth Opportunities Programme that taught school-leavers skills for a year. With the workshop, Morrissey shot short silent films on Super 8, {{where he was}} taught by Bert Byron, who introduced him to US Independent and foreign films for the first time. Although the scheme paid £23.50 a week and took young people off unemployment benefits, Morrissey reflected in 2009 that many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> just used as lackeys. After his acting career escalated, he started directing because he was aware that, as an actor, he was coming into a project quite late into development and then leaving before post-production, {{and he wanted to}} see a film through to the end. Morrissey has said that he prefers to keep acting and directing separate, and would not direct anything he is acting in.|$|E
5|$|The {{new owners}} faced a chaotic situation. The team had few players under contract, {{and had made}} little effort to sign any of their draft picks, most of which had signed with the NFL. The league {{attempted}} to strengthen the Jets and the woeful Oakland Raiders {{by allowing them to}} select players from the other six teams, and by giving them the first opportunity to sign players cut from NFL rosters. Ewbank, who had discovered Colts great Johnny Unitas at an open tryout, held tryouts for the Jets. Only seven <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> invited to training camp, and one, Marshall Starks, made the team as a second-teamer. In mid-July, it was announced that the Jets could not move into Shea Stadium until 1964.|$|E

5|$|Two so {{dissimilar}} {{painters and}} tempers as Einar Jolin and GAN were both called Expressionists. During {{most of the}} 1910s this term was used {{in a number of}} contexts in Sweden. In 1915, the Herwarth Walden gallery Der Sturm in Berlin, a venue for Expressionists, presented an exhibition, Schwedishe Expressionisten (Swedish Expressionism), with works by Swedish artists. Jolin participated with six paintings, three of these were vistas from Stockholm. The rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> Isaac Grunewald, Edward Hald, GAN and Sigrid Hjertén. In the autumn of 1915, Jolin and GAN held a joint exhibition in Lund University's art museum. Despite their differences, their friendship continued during GAN's years in Stockholm (1916–1919). Jolin was tired of Isaac Grünewalds increasingly dominant role among the young Swedish artists at that time, a sentiment shared by GAN. Expressionism never became a dominant style for Jolin, not in the way GAN {{and other members of the}} group embraced it. GAN always objected to Jolin's choice to include colors such as pearl gray and light purple or violet in his paintings.|$|E
25|$|Andijan was {{the center}} and {{flashpoint}} of the Andijan Uprising of 1898 in which the followers of Sufi leader Madali Ishan attacked the Russian barracks in the city, killing 22 and injuring 16-20 more.
