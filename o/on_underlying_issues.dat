40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctorate of Clinical Psychology (DCP) Scope: The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the relationship between mindfulness and eating disordered symptom to inform treatment. Additionally, underlying factors including body image, self control, sense of self, identity, negative affect and distress, personality and quality of life, were also investigated in order to increase understanding about eating disorders and the interaction of these factors with the individuals’ capacity to be mindful. Purpose: There has been increasing interest in the use of mindfulness and acceptance based therapies in treating various disorders and conditions, however evidence to support the application of mindfulness-based treatments for eating disorders is limited. The theoretical underpinnings of mindfulness-based approaches focus <b>on</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>issues</b> rather than eating behaviour itself. The importance of the research included in this thesis is highlighted by the serious health risks associated with eating disorders, as well as the inadequacies recognised with CBT as a psychological intervention for eating disorders. Methodology: This research consisted of two studies. In Study 1 a battery of questionnaires including: the Eating Disorder Examination – Questionnaire, Kentucky Mindfulness Inventory, the Body Image Acceptance and Action Questionnaire, the Ego Identity Processes Questionnaire, Sense of Self Inventory and a measure of the Big 5 traits of personality; was administered online to first year psychology students at an Australian University (N= 411). In Study 2 people diagnosed with an eating disorder presenting to a specialist service in NSW, Australia for treatment (N= 10) completed the battery. Results: Study 1 results in the student sample indicated a strong negative relationship between eating disorder symptoms and acceptance of body image. Observing alone as a mindfulness skill was related to higher reported eating disorder symptoms, however the mindfulness skills acceptance without judgment and action with awareness were related to lower eating disorder symptoms. Body image Study 2 results also provided further evidence for this relationship, with the clinical population producing a lower than average capacity for Mindfulness. Further, findings in Studies 1 and 2 provided evidence of an association between eating disorder symptomatology and additional factors including body image, sense of self, self compassion, personality, self control and quality of life, as well as high co-morbidity with other Axis I and Axis II mental health disorders. General Conclusions and Implications: These findings are consistent with theory that certain aspects of Mindfulness (especially acceptance without judgment and action with awareness) play a role in reducing distress, providing some support for a possible role of mindfulness based interventions in treating Eating Disorders and additional evidence for the application of Mindfulness based treatment approaches in this population. Moreover, relationships with additional factors as well as high levels of co-morbidity highlight the need for thorough assessment and support the holistic psychological treatment approaches, focusing on the whole person rather than specifically targeting eating disordered thoughts and behaviour...|$|E
40|$|This report {{proposes a}} {{monitoring}} framework {{to support the}} Commission’s oversight and advocacy functions and to report meaningfully about service delivery to young people {{in contact with the}} youth justice system. The aim, through collecting data, analysing it and converting it to evidence about outcomes, is to positively influence the service system, so that it is able to better {{meet the needs of the}} children and young people who depend on it. Young people in contact with the youth justice system are among Queensland’s most vulnerable and disadvantaged, and the circumstances that lead to their offending are often complex and cumulative. It is widely acknowledged that those who progress to the statutory youth justice system will have experienced, as a context to their offending, circumstances that include family stressors and dysfunction such as poverty, low parental capacity and abuse or neglect. They may also have experienced personal problems, such as chronic health and wellbeing issues, interrupted schooling and poor educational outcomes. The complexity of these contextual issues creates challenges in achieving agreement about the risk factors that influence contact with the youth justice system and the best way to prevent them from manifesting or escalating. In meeting the shared challenges of preventing, diverting and rehabilitating at-risk young people from a trajectory of offending behaviour and progression to the statutory youth justice system, it will be necessary for contemporary evidence about the service system to be readily available to stakeholders. Ideally, at any given point, there should be a shared understanding across the community, government and non-government sectors as to the complexity of reporting <b>on</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>issues,</b> and where energy and effort can most usefully be applied to generating better outcomes for young people at-risk. This is the Commission’s first consolidated effort to report systemically about the outcomes experienced by young people in contact with the youth justice system. The report explicitly incorporates an invitation to stakeholders to provide their views on how outcomes the youth justice system generates for young people can best be monitored and reported (annually), to achieve an accepted and credible evidence base for advocacy and action. This consultation report is based upon a proposed framework that incorporates three main service domains: youth offending and prevention services; diversionary services; and supervision, intervention and reintegration services. Indicators and measures have been proposed for each domain, targeted to particular areas of service delivery. The Commission has a unique role and functions that enable it to independently research and advocate for improvements to the youth justice system to address risk factors, and to monitor and report about the statutory services. This consultation report has used sample data from the 2008 - 09 period to provide an example of how the Commission proposes to represent findings from across the youth justice system in its inaugural Child Guardian Report: Youth Justice System 2010 - 11. This consultation report also discusses current oversight initiatives being undertaken by the Commission relevant to the youth justice system. This information has been used to provide an up-to-date context for comment...|$|E
40|$|The studies {{contained}} {{in this thesis}} investigate {{the impact of a}} return to work (RTW) programme that has been conducted by Malaysian Social Security Organisation (SOCSO). Important findings <b>on</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>issues</b> of occupational performance and participation, health status, and emotional wellbeing of injured workers is presented using two frameworks, the Model of Human Occupation (MOHO) and International Classification of Functioning and Disabilities (ICF), and also the different phases of RTW programme (off-work, re-entry, maintenance and advancement phases). To examine the issues, these four phases were used to explore injured workers abilities and capacities. The injured workers also were interviewed about their experiences and expectations regarding the supports that they had obtained from the stakeholders whilst involved with SOCSO’s RTW programme. The thesis is organised into the following chapters. The background of the research and appraisal of the underpinning theoretical frameworks are explained in Chapter 1. A literature review of studies regarding musculoskeletal disorders and RTW outcomes, types of interventions and instruments that have been used to study RTW are critiqued in Chapter 2. Five publications (two published and three under consideration) comprise Chapters 3 to 7. These are individual studies addressing five key research questions that arose from literature review, theoretical model and the process of RTW. A variety of methodologies have been employed to answer the research questions, including test and re-test reliability, validity analysis, cross-sectional surveys, parametric and non-parametric tests, correlation test and qualitative study (thematic analysis). In the first study (chapter 3), we found that Malaysian language Occupation Self Assessment version 2. 2 (OSAv 2. 2) was reliable and valid to be used to assess biospsychological factors in the Malaysian RTW programme. The Malaysian OSAv 2. 2 showed high overall internal consistency, with a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0. 91. In addition, test-retest reliability (Intra-class correlation (ICC)) for all 21 items ranged from 0. 41 to 0. 84. In terms of convergent validity, the physical functioning subscale of the Health Surveillance Survey (SF- 36 v 2) had a moderate and significant relationship to the OSAv 2. 2 competence scale (rho= 0. 552, p= 0. 001). In the second study (chapter 4), we found that occupational competence (mean= 53. 09, SD= 10. 38) in our sample (n= 35) was found to be significantly lower than the reference population (mean= 57. 19, SD= 7. 47, p= 0. 025) but there were no differences in our results based on gender, job status, or whether the person was still receiving medical treatment. Significant associations were found with most activity limitations measured by the SF- 36 v 2, with the strongest of these occurring with the item “bending, kneeling or stooping” (rho= 0. 64) and “carrying groceries” (rho= 0. 53) (p< 0. 05). All participants rated the impact of their health problems on social activities as moderate to extreme. In the third study (chapter 5), we found that all of the injured workers (n= 102) exhibited below-average health (as measured by SF- 36 v 2) when compared to the internationally-established normative population (mean= 50. 00, SD= 10. 00), with their physical health component summary (mean= 37. 77, SD= 7. 69) rated lower than their mental health (mean= 38. 98, SD= 11. 11). Across the different groups, significant differences were found in 5 of 8 SF- 36 v 2 domains including role-physical, vitality, bodily pain, general health, and mental health (p< 0. 05). The maintenance group had significant differences when compared to either the off-work or re-entry groups. However, non-significant differences emerged when comparing between off-work and re-entry groups. In the fourth study (chapter 6), injured workers (n= 78) exhibited significantly lower occupational competence (OC) (mean= 50. 45 SD= 11. 86) (as measured by OSAv 2. 2) in comparison with an international group with various disabilities (mean= 57. 19, SD= 7. 47, p< 0. 001). In contrast, there was a significantly higher negative emotional state (NES) (mean= 21. 30, SD= 15. 99) (as measured by Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS- 21)) when compared with Malaysia’s general population (mean= 16. 50, SD= 9. 10, p= 0. 011). Significant differences in OC and NES were also found between workers in the three RTW phases (p< 0. 031). In particular, OC and NES in the off-work and re-entry phases were significantly lower (OC) and higher (NES) than in the maintenance phase. Furthermore, there was a moderate, negative correlation between OC and NES in the off-work and re-entry phase groups. This indicated that low levels of perceived OC were associated with higher levels of NES. In the fifth study (chapter 7), injured workers (n= 21) described personal experiences and expectations of support they obtained when they were in the SOCSO’s RTW programme. While participants experienced several positive supports in their RTW, they also suggested that the compensation provider, case managers, employers and health professionals provide further resources and services. These ranged from more flexibility in RTW programmes, provision of clear information and communication about requirements for injured workers to the employer and more moral and psychological support. All provide support for the need for consideration of the injured workers health status, emotional wellbeing and occupational functioning across the off-work, re-entry, maintenance and advancement phases of the RTW programme. The final chapter (Chapter 8) provides a discussion of the significant findings in relation to the health, emotional wellbeing and occupational functioning statuses of the participants involved in this thesis. It summarises the themes that emerged from their experiences and expectations of support whilst they were in the SOCSO’s RTW programme. It also includes the limitations of the study and directions for future research. This thesis has demonstrated that, because the occupational performance and participation of injured workers with musculoskeletal disorders is impacted, return to work programmes need to address these issues, especially when workers are in the off-work and re-entry phases. In particular, health status and emotional wellbeing need to be addressed because, as shown in this body of work, these are associated with occupational performance and participation. RTW programmes must not only look at actual numbers of people who are returning to work, but also the underlying issues related to workers’ interests, roles, routines, and performance or skills in daily living/work. Furthermore, the findings recommend the establishment of RTW guidelines for employers, employees and health providers. These must be produced and implemented at a national level, as per the practice in other developed countries. These studies provide an evidence base to consider injured workers’ occupational performance and participation in the process of RTW, since these are associated with overall health and mental status. The findings also provide a basis for the development of occupationally-based interventions to support RTW conducted by SOCSO especially in the early off-work and re-entry phases. The emergent themes in terms of expectations from the injured themselves of different stakeholders can be reflected on to improve the management of SOCSO’s national RTW programm...|$|E
