The building's hip roof features overhanging eaves, an element common to Prairie style architecture. The entire structure rests upon a stepped, limestone water table. The main feature of the front facade, besides the octagonal towers, is the 20ft (6.10 m) X 20ft, one-story sun porch projecting from the building. The sun porch has a low-pitched hip roof with an eave that projects over the front door, which is centered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> flanked by two pairs of casement windows. Above the sun porch, on the second floor, {{is a pair of}} art glass doors which open onto a balcony between the two octagonal towers.|$|E
500|$|The {{church is}} built from rubble masonry dressed with freestone, {{and it has}} a slate roof, with a bellcote at the west end and stone crosses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> chancel roofs. The timbers of the roof can be seen from inside. The walls have been {{assessed}} as being [...] "probably not older than the fifteenth century". There is no internal division between the nave and the chancel, and the church as a whole is [...] long by [...] wide. The porch, at the west end of the south wall, was added in the late 19th century. There is one window in the north wall and two in the south wall, all of which are single windows set in rectangular frames; the east window has a pair of lights (vertical sections of window separated by a mullion). [...] All the windows date from the late 19th century. The plain bowl-shaped font dates from the 12th century. There is a brass memorial plaque recording three people who died in the 1640s. The 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire recorded that the church possessed a silver cup from 1630 and a salver dated 1784–85. The churchyard contains some gravestones, including a few dating from the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
50|$|The House at 343 Highland Avenue is a {{historic}} two-family house in Somerville, Massachusetts. The 2.5 story wood frame Queen Anne style house was built c. 1880 as commuter housing.

It was built on land that {{had been part of}} a brickyard, which was subdivided for development in the 1870s.|$|R

500|$|After {{returning}} to the studio in Spain in late January, Björk decided that producer Nellee Hooper, who had produced both Debut and Post, would not return, as Björk stated that they had [...] "both stopped surprising each other". Björk had intended to produce the album alone, but she abandoned the idea and [...] sought out a group of close collaborators including Dravs, Howie B, Guy Sigsworth and LFO's Mark Bell. Howie B had worked with Björk previously on Debut and Post and Sigsworth had played harpsichord on Post. The American hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan almost contributed {{to the production of}} Homogenic, but were unable due to their production on the album Wu-Tang Forever, which had taken longer than planned. Most of the melodies on the album were created by Björk, who then composed string sections on a Casio keyboard and brought them to programmers who would add suitable rhythmic patterns. Björk desired to have Mark Bell contribute to her albums Debut and Post, only finding him available for Homogenic. Mark Bell was credited {{for the majority of the}} album's production, including the songs [...] "Pluto", [...] "Alarm Call", and the bass line in [...] "Jóga". Björk stated about her collaboration with Bell that she [...] "trusts and respects what [...] does for me. If I were to say who has influenced me most it would be Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Brian Eno and Mark Bell". Other unorthodox methods of recording were used during the production, including Björk wanting to record outside <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> using non-professionals to help with production, such as Rebecca Storey, who was hired as a babysitter but added to the production staff after showing interest in the equipment.|$|E

Wotton House was a training college for the Fire Service and then, after being empty for nearly 13 years, {{has been turned into}} a hotel and conference centre with over 100 bedrooms. Three areas of the House remain in the original layout and architectural style, and the hotel has a building and grounds of historic importance from the 17th century.

2500|$|The {{brickwork}} {{is typical}} of Virginia colonial churches in being laid with a water table, a section standing on the foundation, a brick’s length wider than the walls that are nineteen inches thick. [...] The transition from the water table to the walls is made with an ovolo, a convex ¼ round, molded brick. As is the custom, English bond is present {{on all of the}} water table. The walls, however, are varied in their brickwork with some sections being laid in Flemish bond, other sections in English bond, and still other sections in irregular, mixed bond. Flemish bond is used regularly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> most of the south wall. English bond is used on the upper eastern part of the south wall, the east and west gables, two sections of the north wall and the chancel wall. The north wing is a mixture of Flemish and irregular bonds. Glazed headers are used with some regularity in the walls as is typical with Flemish bond, but some sections show an irregular use of this feature also ...|$|E
