25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I <b>open</b> <b>my</b> eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E

500|$|As Tubman aged, the seizures, headaches, and {{suffering}} from her childhood head trauma continued to plague her. At {{some point in}} the late 1890s, she underwent brain surgery at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital. Unable to sleep because of pains and [...] "buzzing" [...] in her head, she asked a doctor if he could operate. He agreed and, in her words, [...] "sawed <b>open</b> <b>my</b> skull, and raised it up, and now it feels more comfortable". She had received no anesthesia for the procedure and reportedly chose instead to bite down on a bullet, as she had seen Civil War soldiers do when their limbs were amputated.|$|E
500|$|During his 16-year NBA career, Barkley was {{regarded}} as one of the most controversial, outspoken and dominating players in the history of basketball. His impact on the sport went beyond his rebounding titles, assists, scoring and physical play. His confrontational mannerisms often led to technical fouls and fines on the court, and his larger than life persona sometimes gave rise to national controversy off of it, such as when he was featured in ads that rejected pro athletes as role models and declared, [...] "I am not a role model." [...] Although his words often led to controversy, according to Barkley his mouth was never the cause because it always spoke the truth. He stated, [...] "I don't create controversies. They're there long before I <b>open</b> <b>my</b> mouth. I just bring them to your attention." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{conception}} of the album, Aguilera told MTV News that [...] "it is a new beginning, a re-introduction {{of myself as a}} new artist in a way, because for the first time people are really seeing and getting to know who I really am". She also revealed, [...] "Coming off of the height of being a part of such a big pop-craze phenomenon, that imagery of that cookie-cutter sweetheart, without it being me, I just had to take it all down and get it away from me. And that is why I actually named the album Stripped, because it is about being emotionally stripped down and pretty bare to <b>open</b> <b>my</b> soul and heart". [...] "Walk Away" [...] was written by Aguilera, Scott Storch and Matt Morris, with production handled by Storch.|$|E

500|$|In January 1856, Stone {{was accused}} in court, {{and spoke in}} defense of a rumor put forward by the {{prosecution}} that Stone gave a knife to former slave Margaret Garner, on trial for the killing of her own child {{to prevent it from}} being enslaved. Stone was said to have slipped the prisoner the knife so that Garner could kill herself if she was forced to return to slavery. Stone was referred to by the court as [...] "Mrs. Lucy Stone Blackwell" [...] and was asked if she wanted to defend herself; she preferred to address the assembly off the record after adjournment, saying [...] "...With my own teeth I would tear <b>open</b> <b>my</b> veins and let the earth drink my blood, rather than wear the chains of slavery. How then could I blame her for wishing her child to find freedom with God and the angels, where no chains are?" ...|$|E
500|$|Carmella's exit storyline was devised {{months prior}} to Blair's departure. Producers had planned to reunite Carmella and Oliver and have them leave together, however Hoflin decided to go travelling, meaning he was {{unavailable}} for filming. Prior to Hoflin's departure, he and Balir filmed scenes showing their reunion. Scripts were quickly rewritten to portray Oliver in Portugal, where Hoflin was in real life, instead of New York where Oliver left for upon his exit. Describing her reaction to Carmella's scripts towards the end, Blair commented: [...] "After a while I'd <b>open</b> <b>my</b> script and say, 'Please give me one scene where I'm smiling'. And then I'd read the script and think, 'Damn - no smiling scenes again'." [...] Blair had originally hoped that Carmella would be killed on-screen, as she felt a dramatic send off would have been fitting. After the [...] "tragic" [...] final year Carmella underwent, Blair decided she was happy with the exit because [...] "something finally goes right for her". Blair also opined: [...] "It's a really lovely story and I think the fans will be happy with it." [...] Carmella's [...] "happy exit storyline" [...] saw her leaving in a taxi surrounded by all of her friends waving her off, after they convinced her {{to start a new}} life with Oliver.|$|E
500|$|... "Sing for Me" [...] {{is a power}} ballad, with a {{duration}} of four minutes (...) [...] Its instrumentation consists of [...] "soft" [...] strings, a [...] "delicate" [...] piano melody and [...] "80s power ballad-type drums" [...] at its close. The key in which the structure was composed is changed {{during the course of the}} song. Aguilera's vocals span from E♭3 to E♭5. Aguilera's vocal performance garnered a comparison to Gabby Douglas and the vocal gymnastics that she projects from Mike Wass for Idolator. He also noted that although Carey would consider the vocals runs as [...] "over-the-top", they fit with the nature of the song. The song features a [...] "thunderous" [...] ironic chorus which consists of the lyrics Cause when I <b>open</b> <b>my</b> mouth, my whole heart comes out." [...] According to Chris Younie for 4Music, Aguilera belts the song out [...] "as if her life depends on it." [...] The [...] "reflective ballad" [...] may be what was created as a result of Aguilera singing [...] "Beautiful" [...] alone in her bedroom after the weak commercial response of Bionic. It represents a [...] "fine line" [...] between the [...] "her hurt over the Bionic backlash and the woe-is-me territory she occasionally veers into on some of the album’s worst tracks." [...] Aguilera tries to [...] "shake her insecurities" [...] during the lines [...] "I don't care what the world thinks or how I sound." [...] According to Annie Zaleski for The A.V. Club, Aguilera [...] "discusses working through regret and reclaiming her sense of self." ...|$|E

500|$|Nielsen {{lived for}} several years in Fort Norman (now Tulita) in the Northwest Territories where his father was with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. His father was an abusive man who beat his wife and sons, and Leslie longed to escape. When he {{graduated}} from high school at 17, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force even though he was legally deaf (he wore hearing aids most of his life). Following graduation from Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts in Edmonton, Nielsen enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and trained as an aerial gunner during World War II. He was too young to be fully trained or sent overseas. He worked briefly as a disc jockey at a Calgary, Alberta, radio station, before enrolling at the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts in Toronto. While studying in Toronto, Nielsen received a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse. He noted, [...] "I couldn't refuse, but I must say when you come from the land of the snow goose, the moose and wool to New York, you're bringing every ton of hayseed and country bumpkin that you packed. As long as I didn't <b>open</b> <b>my</b> mouth, I felt a certain security. But I always thought I was going to be unmasked: 'OK, pack your stuff.' 'Well, what's the matter?' 'We've discovered you have no talent; we're shipping you back to Canada. He moved to New York City for his scholarship, studying theatre and music at the Neighborhood Playhouse, while performing in summer stock theatre. Afterward, he attended the Actors Studio, until his first television appearance in 1950 on an episode of Studio One, alongside Charlton Heston, for which he was paid $75.|$|E
2500|$|I like to {{pray and}} I like to meditate. Doing just three minutes of prayer and a minimum of five minutes {{meditation}} twice a day sets the tone—like an arrow so that you're hitting your target. When I pray I always thank Mother Nature for all the beauty in the world; it's about having an attitude of gratitude. And then I pray to Christ to say, 'Thank you for this day and {{my family and my}} health,' and now that I'm older I've added, 'Please illuminate me. Please <b>open</b> <b>my</b> heart chakra. <b>Open</b> <b>my</b> aperture and uplift my consciousness so that I can be the best version of myself.' ...|$|E

After the war, he realized he had been taught lies and felt betrayed. This sense of betrayal later appeared in his writing.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{religious}} or spiritual views, Seeger replied: [...] "I feel most spiritual when I’m out in the woods. I feel part of nature. Or {{looking up at the}} stars.

2500|$|She also wore {{a silver}} {{necklace}} with three small turquoise stones. The necklace had a homemade appearance and resembled replica Native American jewelry {{made in the}} southwestern United States.

The studio relocated a few times until it ended up in Saddle Brook, New Jersey. He said in 2011 of choosing a New Jersey location, [...] "I didn't want to open a studio that would become just one of the studios in the area.
