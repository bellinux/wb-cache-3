30|$|The four {{additional}} country-level predictors {{all come}} from version 4 of the Educational Systems Database by Bol and Van de Werfhorst (2016). 5 The external differentiation index captures differences in the extent and timing <b>of</b> <b>tracking</b> in lower and upper secondary education.

Values for these measures refer to 2003 (age of first selection and number <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> at age 15) and 2002 (length <b>of</b> <b>tracked</b> curriculum) or the closest year available.|$|R

5|$|The {{international}} governance <b>of</b> <b>track</b> {{and field}} {{falls under the}} jurisdiction of athletics organisations. The International Association of Athletics Federations is the global governing body for track and field, and athletics as a whole. The governance <b>of</b> <b>track</b> and field at continental and national level is also done by athletics bodies. Some national federations are named after the sport, including USA Track & Field and the Philippine Amateur Track & Field Association, but these organisations govern more than just track and field and are in fact athletics governing bodies. These national federations regulate sub-national and local track and field clubs, as well as other types of running clubs.|$|E

5|$|Train {{frequencies}} {{are primarily}} {{limited by the}} fact that most lines funnel into the Transbay Tube and San Francisco.

5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bolliger & Mabillard roller {{coasters}} is the box-section track. The running rails {{are connected to}} a box-section spine, instead of the circular spine used by other manufacturers. When a train travels around a box-section track, it creates a distinctive roaring sound, which is unique to this style <b>of</b> <b>track.</b> However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters, such as Talon at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Gatekeeper at Cedar Point the track is filled with sand to reduce this noise.|$|E
5|$|A {{variant of}} the Automatic Block System, Automatic and Track Control (ATC) has since been introduced, which {{provides}} the same benefits as ABS on single lines <b>of</b> <b>track,</b> while still ensuring only one train in a section at a time.

To cope with variable loads on the system, very large storage lead–acid batteries were installed, the initial one at East Terrace comprising 293 cells and a 50ton tank of sulphuric acid.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The hydro-mechanical {{differential}} turning {{mechanism is}} the new type of double power flow turning mechanism <b>of</b> <b>tracked</b> vehicle. The hydraulic stepless speed regulation and the high efficiency of mechanical transmission are integrated into the turning mechanism. The stepless turning <b>of</b> <b>tracked</b> vehicle can be achieved. Basing on hydro-mechanical differential turning theory, the scheme design of steering wheel control system <b>of</b> <b>tracked</b> vehicle <b>of</b> hydro-mechanical differential turning is finished. By establishing model of steering wheel control system, its working stability and following characteristic is simulated and analyzed in this paper. The demand of hydro-mechanical differential turning <b>of</b> <b>tracked</b> vehicle can be realized by the steering wheel control system designed through the simulation results...|$|R

5|$|Before its takeover, the DR {{had carried}} out some joint {{electrification}} experiments with the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the other sub-surface line {{with which the}} DR shared the Inner Circle. A section <b>of</b> <b>track</b> between Earl's Court and High Street Kensington was electrified with a four-rail system and a jointly owned test train operated a shuttle service between February and November 1900. Having proven the practicality of electric traction, the two companies set up a joint committee to select a supplier of equipment for the electrification of their networks.|$|E
5|$|British Railways {{announced}} a complete rebuild of Euston that could accommodate a fully electrified West Coast Main Line in 1959. Because of the restricted layout <b>of</b> <b>track</b> and tunnels {{at the northern}} end, enlargement could be accomplished only by expanding southwards over the area occupied by the Great Hall and the Arch. Consequently, the London County Council were given notice that the Arch and the Great Hall would be demolished, which was granted on the proviso that the Arch would be restored and re-sited. This was financially unviable as BR estimated it would cost at least £190,000 (now £).|$|E
