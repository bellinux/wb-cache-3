[...] On 16June1993 the Court of Vesoul, and on 24March1994 the [...] Court of Appeal of Besançon, sentenced the church to pay court costs and damages to the CCMM. In a second complaint filed on 27November, the CCMM and the Centre Information Jeunesse in Haute-Saône were sued after distributing a publication critical of the church. Both complaints were dismissed. In 1996, the two appeals for cassation filed {{by the church}} were rejected; the court held that the CCMM's writings did not fall under defamation, said that damages to the church's honor were not proven, that [...] "no reproach can be done when CCMM called 'cult' the Evangelical Church of Pentecost", and that the association [...] "merely assesses the nature and trends of a religious community, reports some of its practices, including those relating to the disease healing and its methods of recruitment through agencies providing relief without indicating that they are the community's emanations".|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to its wealth of practical evidence, Causae et Curae is also noteworthy for its organizational scheme.

Thus, when she approached medicine as a type of gardening, it was not just as an analogy.

Wojtyła and the Polish bishops contributed a draft text to the Council for Gaudium et spes. According to the historian John W. O'Malley, the draft text Gaudium et spes that Wojtyła and the Polish delegation sent [...] "had some influence on the version that was sent to the council fathers that summer but was not accepted as the base text". According to John F.

[...] To {{put an end to the}} [...] "institutional and political crisis which has been shaking Chad for more than three decades", the preamble states that the Chadian people are committed [...] "to build a state of law and a united nation founded on public liberties and fundamental human rights, dignity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>person,</b> and political pluralism, on the African values of solidarity and brotherhood", and also to seek to reach the goal of African unity.

2500|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} [...] "human life must be {{respected}} and protected absolutely {{from the moment}} of conception." [...] Accordingly, it opposes procedures whose purpose is to destroy an embryo or fetus for whatever motive (even before implantation), but admits acts, such as chemotherapy or hysterectomy of a pregnant woman who has cervical cancer, which indirectly result in the death of the fetus. The Church holds that [...] "the first right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>person</b> is his life" [...] and that life is assumed to begin at fertilization. As such, Canon 1398 provides that [...] "a person who procures a successful abortion incurs an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication" [...] from the Church, which can only be removed when that individual seeks penance and obtains absolution. Since the first century, the Church has affirmed that every procured abortion is a moral evil, a teaching that the Catechism of the Catholic Church declares [...] "has not changed and remains unchangeable". With the papal bull Apostolicae Sedis moderationi of 1869, Pope Pius IX, without making any distinction about the stage of pregnancy, listed as subject to an excommunication from which only a bishop could grant absolution those who effectively procured an abortion. The authors of one book have interpreted this as [...] "Pius IX declared all direct abortions homicide", but the document merely declared that those who procured an effective abortion incurred excommunication reserved to bishops or ordinaries. In 1895, the Church specifically condemned therapeutic abortions.|$|E
