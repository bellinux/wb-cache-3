5|$|On September 22, 2011, Dugard {{filed suit}} in US District Court for the Northern District of California accusing the United States of failing to monitor Phillip {{when he was a}} federal parolee. Dugard alleged in her lawsuit against the federal {{government}} that parole <b>officials</b> <b>should</b> have returned Garrido to prison for any number of parole violations that preceded her abduction, including testing positive for drugs and alcohol. Her lawsuit was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 15, 2016. The court ruled in a 2–1 decision that Dugard had not been victimized by Garrido {{at the time he was}} placed under federal parole supervision, and there was no way to anticipate she would become his victim. As a result, federal authorities in California had no duty to protect her or other members of the general public from him. In a dissenting opinion, Chief District Court Judge William Smith said the majority had improperly analyzed Dugard's case, and said there was good reason to hold the government liable.|$|E
25|$|The European Parliament {{released}} a statement in March 2005 in which it denounced the Belarusian government as a dictatorship. The European parliamentarians were primarily concerned about the suppression of independent media outlets {{in the country and}} the fraudulent referendum. A resolution of the European Parliament declared that the personal bank accounts of President Lukashenko and other high-ranking Belarusian <b>officials</b> <b>should</b> be tracked and frozen.|$|E
25|$|The airport's {{intended}} use {{was as a}} stop-over for large numbers of aircraft in transit. This happened only once, in late 1944, when ninety Junkers Ju 87 Stukas refuled at Eggemoen. During early 1945 the Wehrmacht designated Eggemoen as a site to fly out senior <b>officials</b> <b>should</b> Germany surrender. Air defenses were installed, with 88 mm guns installed at Vågård and Gundersby, as well as smaller guns at the airfield itself. The Gundersby gun was dismounted and sent elsewhere. A wooden dummy was placed in its place, and Allied intelligence never discovered this.|$|E

25|$|The book is {{primarily}} {{designed for use}} by counterterrorism and law enforcement officials. Terrorist Recognition Handbook is structured into six main sections of information and resources. Appendix resources include explanations of combustible materials, a reference to existing terrorist networks, {{and a list of}} works cited. Nance's main thesis throughout the work is that law enforcement officials must remain vigilant for potential terrorist activities. He compares and contrasts the field of counterterrorism to ordinary criminal prevention, noting that in both cases law enforcement <b>officials</b> <b>should</b> become experts on developing awareness of commons behavior patterns of suspects.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} same time, {{international}} law came to recognize the analogous concept of hostes humani generis ("enemies of the human race"): pirates, hijackers, and similar outlaws whose crimes were typically committed outside the territory of any state. The notion that heads of state and senior public <b>officials</b> <b>should</b> be treated like pirates or outlaws before the global bar of justice is, according to Henry Kissinger, a new gloss on this old concept. From these premises, representing the Enlightenment belief in trans-territorial, trans-cultural standards of right and wrong, derives universal jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{believed}} that the president's authority {{was derived from the}} people, and that public <b>officials</b> <b>should</b> obey their will or resign. Jackson chose Martin Van Buren of New York as Secretary of State, John Eaton of Tennessee as Secretary of War, Samuel D. Ingham of Pennsylvania as Secretary of Treasury, John Branch of North Carolina as Secretary of Navy, John M. Berrien of Georgia as Attorney General, and William T. Barry of Kentucky as Postmaster General. Jackson's first choice of Cabinet proved to be unsuccessful, full of bitter partisanship and gossip.|$|E

2500|$|On January 5, 2014, {{following}} the abduction {{and murder of}} Brooklyn businessman Menachem Stark, Post cover story featured {{a picture of the}} victim dressed in his traditional Hasidic garb accompanied by the headline asking [...] "Who didn't want him dead?" [...] That front page sparked outrage for its insinuation that the murder was justified vigilantism. On that same day, some New York City elected officials condemned Posts cover story. In a press conference led by Brooklyn borough president Eric Adams, New York City Public Advocate Letitia James declared, [...] "Today [...] given license to murder!" [...] James then asked that [...] "every government <b>official</b> <b>should</b> refrain from advertising in the New York Post, every government <b>official</b> <b>should</b> withdraw any governmental notice from the New York Post, and everyone should condemn the New York Post." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{parliament}} {{was gradually}} expanding its {{influence over the}} government. On March16, the president signed a decree that conferred Cabinet rank on Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of the central bank, and three other officials; this was {{in accordance with the}} decision of the eighth congress that these <b>officials</b> <b>should</b> be members of the government. The congress' ruling, however, had made it clear that as ministers they would continue to be subordinate to parliament. In general, the parliament's lawmaking activity decreased in 1993, as its agenda increasingly became to be dominated by efforts to increase the parliamentarian powers and reduce those of the president.|$|E
25|$|When Strom {{started his}} career in the NBA, he felt the most {{important}} aspect was to get the play right. Instead of selling a bad call, he felt that <b>officials</b> <b>should</b> admit their mistake, and get the call right. To get plays called correctly, he brought up the idea of limited use of instant replay for shots made {{at the end of a}} period ("buzzer beaters") and three-point attempts. The NBA eventually adopted the use of instant replay for end of the period field goal attempts and fouls at the start of the 2002–03 NBA season. Strom believed that referee's job was to ensure the game is played correctly, which will allow players to play their particular style. As the NBA began to evolve, Strom opposed the addition of the third official in NBA game for one season, the 1977–78 NBA season, and later in its present form since the 1988–89 NBA season. Strom felt that well-conditioned officials who are able to stay on top of the play would be able to make calls that a third official would be responsible for.|$|E
25|$|Apart of {{the court}} order, NBC News also {{reported}} one former Penn State assistant coach witnessed an incident in the late 1970s, and three other coaches —who {{have gone on to}} work in pro level and other colleges— allegedly saw inappropriate conduct between Sandusky and boys in the early and mid-1990s. Risk management expert Raymond Williams identified both the three incidents with some of the assistant coaches on the Penn State staff at the time, and three others that were reported to university officials; and whether key university <b>officials</b> <b>should</b> have had knowledge about child sex-assault allegations involving Sandusky in each of the six different cases dating to 1976. Mike McQueary claimed former fellow Penn State assistant coaches Greg Schiano and Tom Bradley also knew about Sandusky’s transgressions in a key testimony in a deposition among the documents related to the insurance coverage case, in which he claims that when he told Bradley about what he had seen, Bradley was not shocked, and that Bradley went on to tell him a story about a time Schiano had witnessed Sandusky abusing a child some time during the ‘90s. Both of the former Penn State assistants have denied McQueary's testimony.|$|E

25|$|The Polish nobles {{gathered}} at the rebellion formed a council and outlined their demands in 67 articles. They demanded the dethronement of Sigismund III for breaching the Henrician Articles and the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. They further demanded that the Sejm was to appoint state officials instead of the king; that local <b>officials</b> <b>should</b> be elected and not appointed; and that the rights of Protestants should be expanded and protected. The 1607 Parliament rejected the demands. Meanwhile, the rebel nobles gathered {{in the town of}} Guzów. In 1607 the Polish Royal Army, led by Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, was sent to pacify the rebels. A full-scale battle ensued on 5 July, with 200 casualties, which resulted in the victory of the Royalist forces. By 1609 the rebellion was over. Two years after the start of the revolt, the rebellious nobles formally surrendered to the king at the 1609 meeting of the Sejm, which became known as the Pacification Sejm. In return for their surrender the rebels were granted leniency. Many royal supporters, including Hetman Chodkiewicz, had successfully argued for amnesty for the rebels. Despite the failure of the rebellion, it nevertheless ruined any chance that Sigismund III had to strengthen his role in the government.|$|E

She said that senior police <b>officials</b> <b>should</b> be held accountable for the failure to take adequate measures to stop such incidents and called for [...] "immediate setting up of fast-track courts to try rape cases and to get justice in a time-bound manner". The three constables who had refused to take action upon Ram Adhar's complaint of robbery were suspended for dereliction of duty.|$|E
500|$|Lord Fraser {{advocated}} {{that when}} [...] "construction management" [...] contracts were used, civil servants or local government <b>officials</b> <b>should</b> evaluate {{the risks of}} such a contract and set out {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of embarking upon such a route before their political superiors. Alongside that recommendation, Lord Fraser stated that independent advisors should be retained and have the ability to communicate their advice to ministers, without those views being [...] "filtered" [...] by public officials. Similarly, where civil servants are part of large project management contracts, clear guidelines of governance should be set out and be as rigorous as standards applied in the private sector.|$|E

500|$|Handicapper Brandon Lang told ESPN that it {{is fairly}} easy for a crooked sports {{official}} to fix a game, despite Stern's insistence that Donaghy was a [...] "rogue official". According to Lang, an official can directly influence {{the outcome of a}} game 75 percent of the time if he has money on the game. For instance, Lang said that a crooked NBA referee can fix the total score by calling enough fouls to get both teams in the bonus. When a game is being fixed, Lang said, the <b>officials</b> <b>should</b> be the prime suspects because the players are making too much money to risk their future. [...] Lang also believed a bookie connected to the mob turned Donaghy in to the FBI.|$|E
