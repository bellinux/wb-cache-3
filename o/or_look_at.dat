5|$|After the 1972Summer Games, Brundage {{retired as}} IOC president. Accounts of Brundage's {{state of mind}} in his {{retirement}} differ. IOC director Berlioux stated that Brundage {{would come to the}} Château de Vidy and take telephone calls <b>or</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> correspondence, waiting for Lord Killanin to turn to him for help. According to Berlioux, Brundage sometimes called her from Geneva and asked her to go there. The two would spend hours wandering the streets, saying little. Brundage's longtime , Frederick Ruegsegger, described a different, tranquil, Brundage, whom he compared to an abdicated Japanese emperor.|$|E
25|$|The {{largest of}} the Liepāja massacres took place on three days from Monday, December 15 to Wednesday, December 17, 1941. On December 13, Kurzemes Vārds {{published}} an order by Emil Diedrich, the Nazi police in Liepāja, which required all Jews {{in the city to}} remain in their residences on Monday, December 15 and December 16, 1941. The order came from SD headquarters in Riga; whether it was received by Kügler or his deputy, Reichle, was disputed, with both Kügler and Reichle later claiming Kügler was on leave in Germany. The Latvian police began arresting the Jews in the city on the night of December 13 to 14, bringing them to the Women's Prison, where they were confined in the courtyard. There was not enough room for the people, so they were ordered to stand facing towards the wall, and not move, look for relatives, <b>or</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the guards, who beat people and treated them with brutality. There was an old wooden building, a garage, barn, or horse barn, at the beach at Šķēde. Some of the Jews were taken to this building on the evening of Sunday, December 14.|$|E
