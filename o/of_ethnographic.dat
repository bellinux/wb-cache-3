5|$|Kristen Feilberg (1839–1919) {{stands as}} another Danish {{photographer}} known mainly for his images captured {{far beyond the}} borders of Denmark. From the 1860s until the 1890s, Feilberg participated in expeditions to Sumatra, Singapore, and Penang. In 1867, he exhibited photos at an exhibition in Paris and in 1870 he joined an expedition to the Batak lands of East Sumatra, where he successfully recorded scores <b>of</b> <b>ethnographic</b> images.|$|E
5|$|Already in the 1880s, Muller had {{dabbled in}} {{ethnography}} and writing. On {{the basis of}} materials gathered on his journey to East Africa and South Africa in 1882/’83, he had held public lectures throughout the Netherlands and Belgium. He also published articles on his trip in Dutch magazines and newspapers, and collated these publications into a book titled Zuid-Afrika. It made him somewhat of a celebrity, {{and an expert on}} South Africa and East Africa. During his journey Muller had also collected a large number <b>of</b> <b>ethnographic</b> objects and artefacts, on which he published a richly illustrated study in 1892, together with Joh. F. Snelleman, curator of the Africa collection in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde (National Museum of Ethnology) in Leiden.|$|E
5|$|A {{category}} of historical and geographical literature, focused on regional history and geography, {{emerged during the}} 18th century among Greek scholars. This kind of literature combined the collection <b>of</b> <b>ethnographic</b> data with a conviction in geography's moral and religious purpose. Major representatives of this field were two scholars and clerics, Daniel Philippidis and Grigorios Konstantas. They came {{from the village of}} Milies in Thessaly, modern Greece, and were nicknamed Dimitrieis, from the ancient name of their birthplace (Dimitrias). Both scholars were active members of the Greek diaspora in the Danubian Principalities, in modern Romania, where they studied and taught at the courts of the Greek Orthodox Phanariot and the Princely Academies of Bucharest and Iaşi. This environment offered in general a special attraction for ambitious and educated Greek people from the Ottoman Empire, contributing to the enlightenment of their nation. Philippidis' and Konstantas' work Geographia Neoteriki, published in Vienna in 1791, belongs to a body of contemporary texts which strove to map out the European parts of the Ottoman Empire and Greece in particular.|$|E

50|$|Vsevolod Miller {{graduated}} from the Moscow State University in 1870. In 1884, he became a professor at his alma mater. In 1881, Vsevolod Miller was elected chairman <b>of</b> the <b>ethnographic</b> department <b>of</b> the Moscow Naturalists Society. He {{was one of the}} founders <b>of</b> the <b>Ethnographic</b> Review magazine (1889-1916), keeper <b>of</b> the Dashkova <b>Ethnographic</b> Museum in Moscow (1884-1897), and director of the Lazarev Institute of Oriental Languages (1897-1911). Vsevolod Miller was involved in the study of Indo-Iranian languages (especially Ossetian language), Russian language and folklore.|$|R
5|$|Janáček {{came from}} a region {{characterized}} by its deeply rooted folk culture, which he explored as a young student under Pavel Křížkovský. His meeting with the folklorist and dialectologist František Bartoš (1837–1906) was decisive in his own development as a folklorist and composer, and led to their collaborative and systematic collections of folk songs. Janáček became an important collector in his own right, especially of Lachian, Moravian Slovakian, Moravian Wallachian and Slovakian songs. From 1879, his collections included transcribed speech intonations. He {{was one of the}} organizers of the Czech-Slavic Folklore Exhibition, an important event in Czech culture at the end of 19th century. From 1905 he was President of the newly instituted Working Committee for Czech National Folksong in Moravia and Silesia, a branch of the Austrian institute Das Volkslied in Österreich (Folksong in Austria), which was established in 1902 by the Viennese publishing house Universal Edition. Janáček was a pioneer and propagator <b>of</b> <b>ethnographic</b> photography in Moravia and Silesia. In October 1909 he acquired an Edison phonograph and {{became one of the first}} to use phonographic recording as a folklore research tool. Several of these recording sessions have been preserved, and were reissued in 1998.|$|E

25|$|In Western European terms, Spybuck's style {{might be}} called naïve art, but his works differs from most naïve artists' due to the {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>ethnographic</b> patronage that guided his choice to include certain details and an infusion {{of a sense of}} humor and personality.

25|$|Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through Gertrude Stein, at a {{time when}} both artists had {{recently}} acquired an interest in Tribal art, Iberian sculpture and African tribal masks. They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence <b>of</b> <b>ethnographic</b> art. Picasso's paintings of 1907 have been characterized as proto-Cubism, as Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, the antecedent of Cubism.|$|E
25|$|The {{types of}} stones, bones, and {{minerals}} {{found at the}} campsites further describe the use of animal hides as tent covering. Butchered and burned animal bones found around the fire pit show which types of animals were hunted and eaten. Stone tools such as hide scrapers and deposits of minerals employed in preparing skins show the routine use of animal hides. In addition, there are a host <b>of</b> <b>ethnographic</b> parallels, as indigenous cultures throughout the world relied on animal hides as a shelter covering material until {{the onset of the}} modern era.|$|E
25|$|Ethnographic {{research}} {{has already been}} discussed as useful approach in computer mediated communication in the late 1990s even with a linkage {{to the concept of}} personae. Some designers feel that personas should be based on ethnographic research into users and should not be based purely on the creator's imagination. The use <b>of</b> <b>ethnographic</b> research helps the creation of a number of archetype users {{that can be used to}} develop products that deliver positive user experiences. By feeding in real data, ethnographic research allows design teams to avoid generating stereotypical users that may bear no relation to the actual user’s reality.|$|E

25|$|The Tboli {{are one of}} the {{indigenous}} peoples of South Mindanao. From the body <b>of</b> <b>ethnographic</b> and linguistic literature on Mindanao, they are variously known as Toboli, T'boli, Tböli, Tiboli, Tibole, Tagabili, Tagabeli, and Tagabulu. They term themselves Tboli or T'boli. Their whereabouts and identity are to some extent confused in the literature; some publications present the Toboli and the Tagabili as distinct peoples; some locate the Tbolis to the vicinity of the Buluan Lake in the Cotabato Basin or in Agusan del Norte. The Tbolis, then, reside on the mountain slopes {{on either side of the}} upper Alah Valley and the coastal area of Maitum, Maasim and Kiamba. In former times, the Tbolis also inhabited the upper Alah Valley floor.|$|E
25|$|The {{indigenous}} population or Kanak {{were excluded from}} the French economy and from mining work, ultimately confined to reservations. This sparked a violent reaction in 1878 as High Chief Atal of La Foa managed to unite many of the central tribes and launched a guerrilla war which cost 200 Frenchmen and 1,000 Kanaks their lives. A second guerrilla war took place in 1917, with Catholic missionaries like Maurice Leenhardt functioning as witnesses to the events of this war. Leenhardt would pen a number <b>of</b> <b>ethnographic</b> works on the Kanak of New Caledonia. Noel of Tiamou led the 1917 rebellion, which created a number of orphans, one of which was taken into the care of Protestant Missionary Alphonse Rouel; Wenceslas Thi who would become the father of Jean-Marie Tjibaou.|$|E
25|$|The British Museum houses {{one of the}} world's most {{comprehensive}} collections <b>of</b> <b>Ethnographic</b> material from Africa, Oceania and the Americas, representing the cultures of indigenous peoples throughout the world. Over 350,000 objects spanning thousands of years tells {{the history of mankind}} from three major continents and many rich and diverse cultures; the collecting of modern artefacts is ongoing. Many individuals have added to the department's collection over the years but those assembled by Henry Christy, Harry Beasley and William Oldman are outstanding. Objects from this department are mostly on display in several galleries on the ground and lower floors. Gallery 24 displays ethnographic from every continent while adjacent galleries focus on North America and Mexico. A long suite of rooms (Gallery 25) on the lower floor display African art. There are plans in place to develop permanent galleries for showcasing art from Oceania and South America.|$|E

500|$|In the Comparative Civilizations Review journal, Anthony M. Stevens-Arroyo {{proclaimed that}} it was easy [...] "to get lost" [...] in Dreamtime, believing that the {{multitude}} <b>of</b> <b>ethnographic</b> and historical facts presented by Duerr often distracted from the book's main arguments. Although praising the book's contents, Stevens-Arroyo expressed his annoyance at Duerr's use of humour, believing {{that it was}} inappropriate in such a serious work of scholarship. He also remarked that Duerr [...] "practices what he preaches", noting that the book was something of an apologia for {{his involvement in the}} counter-cultural and drug subcultures of the 1960s and his continuing advocacy of the use of mind-altering substances, in the same style as Timothy Leary. Considering the work to be an attack on social convention, he believes that Duerr has made use of mind-altering drugs to cross boundaries into altered states of consciousness and that Dreamtime is his invitation for others to join him. Stevens-Arroyo did praise Goodman's English translation, but argued that the index was too limited.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{importance}} and feasibility <b>of</b> planning <b>ethnographic</b> fieldwork conducted in educational settings. The investigation is based upon an analysis of fieldwork carried out {{as part of a}} PhD research project conducted between 2001 - 2002 in two Flemish (Belgian) and one English secondary school. Planning ethnographic fieldwork is usually perceived as an ambiguous task: it is seen as a natural ingredient in conducting research but it does not fit the logic of a dynamic qualitative research design. As a result, standard methodological textbooks usually treat the issue <b>of</b> planning <b>ethnographic</b> research as a trivial or peripheral aspect of the research process. This paper highlights the importance of planning in conducting fieldwork by demonstrating that planning activities are beneficial, continuous, essential and feasible activities in the development <b>of</b> an <b>ethnographic</b> research design...|$|R
