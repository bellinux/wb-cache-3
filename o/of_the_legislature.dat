5|$|In 1809, {{the makeup}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> was altered again by Congress to a {{bicameral}} body. A House of Representatives was created and the representation was apportioned by population. The House was then to choose ten candidates from whom the President, through the governor, would choose five {{to form a}} council which served as the upper house <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature.</b> Thereafter, the structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> remained unchanged {{for the remainder of}} the territory's existence.|$|E

5|$|Although {{calls for}} a special session <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> {{had been made in}} February and March, Governor Stanley was not {{initially}} receptive to the idea at the beginning of April. In mid-April, Virginia Lieutenant Governor Gi Stevens urged Stanley to call a special session of the General Assembly to reconsider the Gray Commission proposals. In May, at least one state delegate urged the General Assembly to call itself into special session.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} and into the summer, Stanley began meeting with Senator Byrd, State Senator Gray, and others to strategize about a course of action. Byrd was {{concerned}} that one or more local school districts might integrate, creating a domino effect {{that would lead to}} integration across the entire South. Preventing this from happening became the preeminent concern of Stanley, Byrd, and the others. Stanley called the Gray Commission back into session in late May 1956, but the group was unable to immediately come up with any new recommendations. Attorney General Almond publicly urged Stanley to call a special session <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> on May 31, but House Speaker Moore demanded to know what proposals Almond felt the legislature should pass before any special session was called. On June 4, the Gray Commission again reported to the governor that it {{had not been able to}} improve on its November proposals, but it, too, advised the governor to call a special session <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature.</b> The following day, Governor Stanley announced he would call the legislature into special session in late August.|$|E

An emanation of the 1923 Constitution, it comprised experts tasked with reviewing laws endorsed by Parliament, and whose exact role sparked a series of controversies. Filitti was among those who described the Council as a necessary branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> rather than as an organ of the executive.|$|E

5|$|In {{the state}} {{elections}} of 2012, during which all members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> (but not the governor) were up for election, the shutdown {{was a major}} campaign issue. The Republicans lost their majorities in both houses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> giving the DFL full {{control of the state}} government. Kurt Zellers and other Republican legislators said the shutdown probably was one reason for their electoral defeat. However, other national and state issues may have had more of an influence on the result. The presidential race was also on the ballot, as were the proposed Minnesota Marriage Amendment and Voter ID Amendment, which had been put on the ballot by the legislature in 2011. All of these ballot items increased the turnout of DFL-leaning voters.|$|E

5|$|The Republicans won {{control of}} both houses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> {{for the first time}} in decades, while Dayton {{narrowly}} defeated Republican candidate Tom Emmer with 44% of the vote. Many of the newly elected Republican legislators were affiliated with the Tea Party movement and had more anti-government positions than the Republican establishment. Both Dayton and Republican legislators claimed a popular mandate for their positions.|$|E
5|$|The delegates {{also agreed}} with Madison that the {{executive}} function {{had to be}} independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature.</b> In their aversion to kingly power, American legislatures had created state governments where the executive was beholden to the legislature, and by the late 1780s this was widely seen as being a source of paralysis. The Confederation government was the ultimate example of this.|$|E
5|$|The first New Jersey State Constitution, {{ratified}} in 1776, {{provided that}} a governor be elected annually {{by the state}} legislature, the members of which were selected by the several counties. Under this constitution, the governor {{was president of the}} upper house <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> then called the Legislative Council. The 1844 constitution provided for a popular vote to elect the governor, who no longer presided over the upper house <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> now called the Senate. The 1844 constitution also lengthened the governor's term to three years, set to start on the third Tuesday in January following an election, and barred governors from succeeding themselves. The 1947 constitution extended terms to four years, and limits governors from being elected to more than two consecutive terms, though they can run again after a third term has passed.|$|E

5|$|While {{still in}} the field, Shelby {{was elected to the}} North Carolina General Assembly.

5|$|A {{special session}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> in 1965 changed the Senate to {{represent}} 16 districts and reapportioned the seats, again by county, but {{did so in}} such a way as to make the representation more proportional to population than it had been. Thus, the eastern shore, which had previously elected nine Senators, elected only four after 1965. This was done to preserve the ideal of having whole counties represented by a single Senator, rather than breaking counties up into multiple districts. A constitutional amendment in 1972 expanded the Senate to 47 members, elected from districts proportional to the population. These districts are reapportioned every ten years based on the United States Census to ensure they remain proportional.|$|E
