40|$|Abstract. The global {{three-dimensional}} Lagrangian chemistry-transport model STOCHEM {{has been}} used to follow the changes in the tropospheric distributions of the two major radiatively-active trace gases, methane and tropospheric ozone, following the emission of pulses of the short-lived tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> species, methane, carbon monoxide, NOx and hydrogen. The radiative impacts of NOx emissions were dependent on the location chosen for the emission pulse, whether at the surface or in the upper troposphere or whether in the northern or southern hemispheres. Global warming potentials were derived for each of the short-lived tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> species by integrating the methane and tropospheric ozone responses over a 100 -year time horizon. Indirect radiative forcing due to methane and tropospheric ozone changes appear to be significant for all of the tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> species studied. Whereas the radiative forcing from methane changes is likely to be dominated by methane emissions, that from tropospheric ozone changes is controlled by all the tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> gases, particularly NOx emissions. The indirect radiative forcing impacts of tropospheric ozone changes may be large enough such that ozone precursors should be considered in the basket of trace gases through which policy-makers aim to combat global climate change. 1...|$|E

It is natural component of the atmosphere, due to anthropogenic emissions of <b>ozone</b> <b>precursors</b> its concentration rise. That is unlikely, because ozone is toxic. Ozone is formed as a part of photochemical smog from <b>ozone</b> <b>precursors</b> by photochemical reactions. As <b>ozone</b> <b>precursors</b> nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) are called. Their main source is car traffic. Danger of ozone lies in its reactivity. It oxidizes most of organic compounds, especially those containing double bonds. These are present in membrane lipids. Furthermore, ozone forms more reactive compounds than itself - active oxygen species (AOS), free radicals. Ozone effects negatively both human health and vegetation. Ozone disrupts structure of the cells, which for plants means destroy of leaves and needles, photosynthesis disruption and biomass loss. For that, plants have antioxidants system for AOS scavenging. But it has little effect, when concentration of ozone is high during smog period. Therefore, limits for maximal concentration of ozone in the ambient air are set...|$|R

Despite accounting for about 6 % of present-day anthropogenic emissions of <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> species, the contribution of emissions from megacities to global tropospheric ozone is calculated to be 0. 84 %.

This is opposed by a positive ozone RF of 0. 07 Wm − 2 due to future decreases in ODSs, which is mainly driven {{by an increase in}} tropospheric ozone through stratosphere-to-troposphere exchange.

A third of the ozone RF due to the projected increase in methane results from increases in stratospheric ozone. The sign of the ozone RF due to future changes in climate (including the radiative effects of greenhouse gas concentrations, sea surface temperatures and sea ice changes) is shown to be dependent on the greenhouse gas emissions pathway, with a positive RF (0. 06 Wm − 2) for RCP 4. 5 and a negative RF (− 0. 07 Wm − 2) for the RCP 8. 5 scenario.

A new method is suggested to express how {{the length of the}} period during the year when coniferous and evergreen trees are sensitive to ozone might be affected by climate change. <b>Ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> emission changes from the RCP 4. 5 scenario were combined with climate simulations based on the IPCC SRES A 1 B scenario and used as input to the Eulerian Chemistry Transport Model MATCH from which projections of ozone concentrations were derived. The ozone exposure of vegetation over Europe expressed as AOT 40 was projected to be substantially reduced between the periods 1990 – 2009 and 2040 – 2059 to levels which are well below critical levels used for vegetation in the EU directive 2008 / 50 /EC as well as for crops and forests used in the LRTAP convention, despite that the future climate resulted in prolonged yearly ozone sensitive periods. The reduction in AOT 40 was mainly driven by the emission reductions, not changes in the climate. For the toxicologically more relevant POD 1 index the projected reductions were smaller, but still significant. The values for POD 1 for the time period 2040 – 2059 were not projected to decrease to levels which are below critical levels for forest trees, represented by Norway spruce.

While anthropogenic emissions of precursor substances (NOx, NMVOC, CH 4) are regulated by EU air quality legislation and will decrease further in the future, the emissions of biogenic NMVOC (mainly isoprene) may increase significantly {{in the coming decades}} if short-rotation coppice plantations are expanded strongly to meet the increased biofuel demand resulting from the EU decarbonisation targets. This study investigates the competing effects of anticipated trends in land use change, anthropogenic <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> emissions and climate change on European ground level ozone concentrations and related health and environmental impacts until 2050. The work is based on a consistent set of energy consumption scenarios that underlie current EU climate and air quality policy proposals: a current legislation case, and an ambitious decarbonisation case. The Greenhouse Gas-Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) integrated assessment model was used to calculate air pollutant emissions for these scenarios, while land use change because of bioenergy demand was calculated by the Global Biosphere Model (GLOBIOM). These datasets were fed into the chemistry transport model LOTOS-EUROS to calculate the impact on ground level ozone concentrations. Health damage because of high ground level ozone concentrations is projected to decline significantly towards 2030 and 2050 under current climate conditions for both energy scenarios. Damage to plants is also expected to decrease but to a smaller extent. The projected change in anthropogenic <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> emissions is found to have a larger impact on ozone damage than land use change.
