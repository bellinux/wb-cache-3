5|$|England made 141 and Bradman {{forced them}} to follow on. Miller removed Hutton again, this time caught by Sid Barnes from the first ball of the innings. He {{combined}} with Barnes 45 minutes later to remove Hutton's opening partner Washbrook to leave England at 3/33. The pitch, still rain-affected, hastened England's defeat by an innings and 332 runs within 44 overs. Miller finished with 2/17 from 11 overs in the second innings to end with match figures of 9/77. England had fallen to their heaviest Test defeat on Australian soil, losing 15 wickets {{in the space of}} 210 minutes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>day.</b> Miller's highly productive Ashes debut led to further speculation as to whether he was willing to end his Test career to turn professional in England.

5|$|Five Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital is a 2013 non-fiction book by the American {{journalist}} Sheri Fink. The book {{details the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans in August 2005, and is an expansion of a Pulitzer Prize-winning article written by Fink and published in The New York Times Magazine in 2009. It describes the events that took place at Memorial Medical Center over five days as {{thousands of people were}} trapped in the hospital without power. The triage system put into effect deprioritized critically ill patients for evacuation, and a number of these patients were euthanized by medical and nursing staff shortly before the entire hospital was evacuated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>day</b> of the crisis. Fink examines the legal and political consequences of the decision to euthanize patients and the ethical issues surrounding euthanasia and health care in disaster scenarios. The book was well received by most critics and won three awards, including a National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction.|$|E

5|$|Jardine was not {{successful}} in the final Test, won by Australia. He {{was used as an}} opener, due to an injury to Sutcliffe, and made just 19 and a first ball duck. Once both of his innings were completed, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>day</b> of a match which lasted eight days, he left the match and set off across Australia to catch a boat to India for a holiday. It is not clear if this was planned or if he had simply had enough. Jardine never provided an explanation, to the Australian press nor afterwards. Later, Jardine wrote about the Australian crowds, complaining over their involvement, but praising their knowledge and judgement of the game and describing them as more informed than English crowds. He also expressed later reservations to Bob Wyatt about Percy Chapman, saying that he would have shot him if a gun was available. Jardine did not appear in first-class cricket in the 1929 season due to business commitments.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{received}} several warnings about the invasion from individuals within his government; though he initially disbelieved them, they grew more frequent as the invasion drew near, eventually convincing Noriega {{to go on}} the run. Noriega used a number of subterfuges, including lookalikes and playbacks of his recorded voice, to confuse U.S. surveillance as to his whereabouts. During his flight Noriega reportedly took shelter with several supportive politicians, including Balbita Periñan, the mayor of San Miguelito. The last two days of his flight were spent partly with Noriega's ally Jorge Krupnick. Kempe reported that Noriega considered seeking sanctuary in the Cuban or Nicaraguan embassies, but both buildings were surrounded by U.S. troops. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>day</b> of the invasion, Noriega and four others took sanctuary in the Apostolic Nunciature, the Holy See's embassy in Panama. Having threatened to flee to the countryside and lead guerrilla warfare if not given refuge, he instead turned over the majority of his weapons, and requested sanctuary from José Sebastián Laboa, the papal representative.|$|E

In the Melbourne Boxing Day Test, Kohli was India's top-scorer in both innings.

Kohli followed it with a score of 54 in India's second innings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>day,</b> helping his team draw the Test match. Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket {{at the conclusion of}} this match, and Kohli was appointed as the full-time Test captain ahead of the fourth Test at Sydney.

He was dismissed for 46 in the second innings and India hung in for another draw. Kohli's total of 692 runs in four Tests was the most by any Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} Vithoba temples in Maharashtra, {{and some in}} Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. However, the main centre of worship is Vithoba's temple in Pandharpur.

Along with Vithoba and his consorts—Rukmini, Satyabhama and Radha—other Vaishnava deities are worshipped. These include: Venkateshwara, a form of Vishnu; Mahalakshmi, a form of Vishnu's consort Lakshmi; Garuda and Hanuman (see previous section). Shaiva deities are also worshipped, such as: Ganesha, the elephant-headed god of wisdom and beginnings; Khandoba, a form of Shiva; and Annapurna, a form of Shiva's consort Parvati. The samadhis (memorials) of saints like Namdev, Chokhamela and Janabai, and of devotees such as Pundalik and Kanhopatra, are in and around the temple.
