5|$|A {{terracotta}} Nandi (the bull {{of the god}} Shiva – {{father of}} Murugan), head of a woman, terracotta lamps, potsherds and a shivalinga (aniconic symbol of Shiva) made of green stone {{are some of the}} important artefacts found at the site. The Nandi is the first one made of terracotta to be found. While most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> unearthed belong to the Sangam period, artefacts of a later period including a Chola copper coin have also been found.|$|E
40|$|International audienceConsider an item {{which can}} be {{repaired}} N times, where each repair is general in <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> Kijima (1989). Suppose that <b>the</b> <b>item</b> continuously yields a benefit whose rate at any time t depends only on <b>the</b> virtual age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>item</b> at time t. We find conditions, on the benefit rate function and on some underlying distribution functions, under which the value (that is, <b>the</b> total benefit) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>item</b> stochastically increases as a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inter-failure random times. We also consider an item on which N preventive maintenance actions can be performed, where each such action modifies <b>the</b> virtual age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>item.</b> Again, we assume that <b>the</b> benefit rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>item</b> at time t depends only on its virtual age at that time, and we find conditions under which <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>item</b> stochastically increases as a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inter-maintenance times...|$|R
40|$|Asymptotic {{standard}} errors (SEs) of item re-sponse theory equating coefficient estimates are derived using response functions or their transfor-mations.

5|$|After {{the opening}} up of China from the 1980s, tomb robbery was rampant and many {{artifacts}} were looted and smuggled {{across the border}} to Hong Kong, then a British territory. Ma Chengyuan was active in recovering many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> from the Hong Kong antique market. In 1992, he purchased the 3,000-year-old Jin Hou Su bianzhong (晉侯穌鐘), which were listed by the Chinese government {{as one of the first}} 64 national treasures forbidden to be exhibited abroad in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Swords are {{included}} in the crafts category, and either the sword itself or a sword mounting is designated as a National Treasure. Currently 110 swords and 12 sword mountings are National Treasures. The oldest designated properties date to the seventh century (Asuka period). However, 86 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> are from the Kamakura period, with the most recent object from the Muromachi period. The designated items are located in Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, museums, and private collections.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{state of}} Indiana has 12 {{official}} state emblems, {{as well as}} other designated official and unofficial items. The majority of the symbols in the list are officially recognized and created by an act of the Indiana General Assembly and signed into law by the governor. They are listed in Indiana Code Title 1, Article 2, State Emblems which also regulates the appearance and applicable use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items.</b>|$|E
50|$|In common value auctions <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>item</b> {{for sale}} is {{identical}} amongst bidders, but bidders have different information about <b>the</b> <b>item's</b> value.

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{ethnic groups}} of Malawi have a rich tradition of basketry and mask carving, {{and some of}} these goods are used in traditional ceremonies still performed by native peoples. Wood carving and oil painting are also popular in more urban centres, with many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> produced being sold to tourists. There are several internationally recognised literary figures from Malawi, including poet Jack Mapanje, history and fiction writer Paul Zeleza and authors Legson Kayira, Felix Mnthali, Frank Chipasula and David Rubadiri.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} safety {{meetings}} were scheduled {{in order to}} prevent accidents on the set. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> on the agenda was finding the closest hospital to the set, according to make-up effects coordinator John Vulich. Furthermore, several of the cast and crew members had a fear of snakes, including Manners, David Duchovny, and John Shiban. During one of the days that the show was being prepped, a snake wrangler brought several live rattlesnakes to the set, but one escaped. It was eventually found behind Manners' desk. In order to prevent future accidents, the mouths of the snakes were sutured shut.|$|E
5|$|After Samus {{retrieves}} {{three pieces}} of the Light of Aether, she enters the Ing's Sky Temple and faces the Emperor Ing, the strongest Ing who guards the remaining Light of Aether. Samus defeats the creature and retrieves the last remaining energy, causing Dark Aether to become critically unstable and collapse; however, her path out of the temple is blocked by a horribly altered and unstable Dark Samus. After defeating her foe, Samus escapes as the dark world disappears around her. Returning to U-Mos, she finds that the Luminoth were {{in a state of}} hibernation but have now awakened. After a brief celebration, Samus leaves Aether in her repaired gunship. If the player completes the game with all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> collected, Dark Samus is shown reforming herself above Aether.|$|E

5|$|Domestic cats select food {{based on}} its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most {{strongly}} to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats may reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past. They may also avoid sugary foods and milk. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugars in milk are not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea. They can also develop odd eating habits. Some cats like to eat or chew on other things, most commonly wool, but also plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> eaten.|$|E
5|$|The 1891 {{constitution}} added {{a provision}} that the governor must specify the reason for any specially-called legislative session, and that no other business could be considered during the session. There is, however, no constitutional requirement that the legislature conduct any business during the called session. In 2007, Republican governor Ernie Fletcher called the Assembly into session to consider {{a long list of}} items. The Democratically-controlled House of Representatives maintained that none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> were urgent enough that they could not wait until the regular session convened; they claimed that Fletcher was calling the session only to boost his sagging poll numbers before the upcoming election in which he faced a challenge from Democrat Steve Beshear. The House convened on the day appointed and adjourned an hour later without transacting any business.|$|E
5|$|The archaeological name of {{the site}} is Twyfelfontein 534. It is {{subdivided}} into 15 smaller sites as described by Scherz in 1975. Objects from the site include a variety of stone tools made mostly from quartzite. Type and shape of these tools indicate not only the use on rock but also the prevalence of wood and leather working. Artwork such as pendants and beads from ostrich eggshell fragments have been found at several places. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> of daily use charcoal and bone fragments have been excavated as well as undecorated pottery fragments, although the pottery might have originated from early farmers rather than the Stone Age culture that produced the rock art.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} local two-player {{multiplayer}} with a divided iPad screen, and asynchronous online multiplayer where players construct levels for their opponents to complete. Players spin a wheel {{at the beginning}} of their turn to determine how many hazards they get to place via drag and drop. A few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> are unlocked at first, and more are available with progress through the game or in-app purchases. Gasketball uses a colorful palette and features a cranky robot, who provides a tutorial and resets the ball. It was released as free-to-play with the tutorial unlocked, and four to five chapters available as additional paid downloads.|$|E
5|$|The game {{implements}} {{an inventory}} system to allow Sam to store any items that the player picks {{up during the}} course of the game. The player may select any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> in the inventory and can then attempt to use them on objects in the game world or give them to other characters simply by clicking on the desired target. Unlike Save the Worlds predecessor, Sam & Max Hit the Road, inventory items are context specific, and cannot be used together or combined to create new items. Typically, Sam carries a gun that may be used to solve several puzzles.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist, Samus Aran, {{must travel}} through the world of Tallon IV searching for twelve Chozo Artifacts that will open {{the path to the}} Phazon meteor impact crater, while {{collecting}} power-ups that enable the player to reach previously inaccessible areas. The Varia Suit, for example, protects Samus' armor against dangerously high temperatures, allowing her to enter volcanic regions. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> are obtained after boss and mini-boss fights, which are encountered in all regions except Magmoor Caverns. Items must be collected in a specific order so that the player may progress. For example, players cannot access certain areas until they find a certain Beam to open doors, or discover new ordnance with which to beat bosses. Like the rest of the series, players are incentivized to explore the open world to find upgrades such as ammunition packs and extra health.|$|E
5000|$|The usual term {{applied to}} such {{handling}} is [...] "chain <b>of</b> custody". <b>The</b> term denotes the links in <b>the</b> handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exhibit in question. For example, details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>item,</b> <b>the</b> place, date, {{time it was}} recovered, and by whom it was recovered - the first link. The subsequent links in the chain refer to anyone required to handle the exhibit, mainly for identification purposes. The final link is <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>item</b> in court. This particular level of auditable handling is paramount when dealing with items of a forensic nature, as it reduces the opportunity for the defense to challenge <b>the</b> authenticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>item.</b>|$|R

The portfolio then brings everything together with evidence to prove that the project was completed. The presentation is then given at least 3 times and ties all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> together. All the projects are judged throughout the year, and the top four receive a scholarship to help finance their college education.|$|E

The {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> in the list are officially recognized symbols created by an act of the Maryland General Assembly and signed into law by the governor. However, two of the more famous symbols of Maryland, the state motto and the state nicknames, were never made official by the state government. While the state seal derives from the colonial heritage of the state, the majority of official state symbols were designated in the last few decades.|$|E
5|$|To {{create the}} bank {{needed for the}} episode, Ilt Jones and the {{location}} department staff found a former bank and current animation school and film production house on Fourth and Main Street in downtown Los Angeles.

All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> inside of the bank were bought from a bank-supply catalogue by set decorator Tim Stepeck. During the hold-up scene outside the bank, a four-block area was sealed off to allow cameras to film. A total of eleven cameras, some at different speeds, were used.
