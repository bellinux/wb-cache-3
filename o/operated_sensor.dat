40|$|AbstractOne {{of the key}} {{challenges}} in wireless sensor networks is the efficient usage of restricted energy resources in battery <b>operated</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes. Clustering remains the most effective routing approach used in WSN. Low Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol is an efficient routing approach which has been widely adopted and enhanced to improve the lifespan of deployed sensor networks. However, latterly, clustering algorithms have shown their limitation in extending the network lifespan. In this paper, we propose a new clustering approach based {{on a combination of}} LEACH and MTE protocols. The adoption of multi-hop communication instead of direct communication in cluster filed has optimized the communication in the network. The simulation results illustrate the energy efficiency of the multi-hop cluster based routing approach.

One {{of the most commonly}} employed technique consists in turning on and {{of the power of the}} radio unit to reduce the power consumption. In this paper we exploit the modelling power of Interacting Markoman Agent to evaluate the performance of four different on-off strategies. A Markovian Agent (MA) is an entity whose behaviour is described by a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) and that is able to interact with other MA's by sending and receiving messages. A perceived message may induce a state transition in an MA according to a perception function than can depend on the geographical location of the MA's, on the message routing strategy and on the transmission property of the medium. We represent each sensor by an MA and we show how MA's can interact to produce the collective behaviour of the sensor network...|$|E

The goal {{is to find the}} jointly optimal transmission (power allocation) policy which maximizes the total throughput for a given deadline. First, we address the case in which the storage capacity of the energy harvesting sensor is infinite. In this context, we identify the necessary conditions for such optimal transmission policy. On their basis, we first show that the problem is convex. Then we go one step beyond and prove that (i) the optimal power allocation for the energy harvesting sensor can be computed independently; and (ii) it unequivocally determines (and allows to compute) that of the battery operated one. Finally, we generalize the analysis for the case of finite storage capacity. Performance is assessed by means of computer simulations. Particular attention is paid to the impact of finite storage capacity and long-term battery degradation on the achievable throughput. Comment: Submitted to Elsevier Signal Processing Journa...|$|E

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs) {{consist of}} battery <b>operated</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes. Improving the {{lifetime}} of sensor network is a critical issue. Nodes closer to the sink node drains energy faster due to large data transmission towards a sink node. This problem is resolved through mobility of the sink node. The Mobile sink moves to particular positions in predetermined order to collect data from the sensor nodes. There is considerable delay {{in the case of}} single mobile sink. In this paper we have used the concept of multiple mobile sinks to collect data in different zones which in turn coordinate to consolidate the data and complete the processing of data received from all the sensor nodes. A distributed algorithm synchronizing all the mobile sinks are used to reduce the delay in consolidation of data and reducing the overall energy consumption. The twin gain increases {{the lifetime of}} the Wireless Sensor Network.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{is a central}} challenge in battery <b>operated</b> <b>sensor</b> networks. Current energy-efficient mechanisms employ either duty cycling, which reduces idle listening but does not eliminate it, or low power wake-up radio, which adds complexity and cost to the sensor platform. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism called RFIDImpulse that uses RFID technology as an out-of-band wake-up channel for sensor networks. RFIDImpulse is an on-demand mechanism that enables nodes to sleep until they have to send or receive packets. It relies on IEEE 802. 15. 4 radio to emulate an RFID reader at a sender node, and on an off-the-shelf RFID tag attached to the external interrupt pin of each sensor node. The sender can simply activate the receiver’s tag before sending it data packets. This setup enables both radio and microcontroller to go into deep sleep mode until {{they need to be}} active. We develop an analytical model to evaluate the energy tradeoffs of RFIDImpulse, and then evaluate the mechanism against BMAC and IEEE 802. 15. 4 in high and low traffic scenarios. The results confirm that RFIDImpulse reduces the energy consumption relative to both protocols for low and medium traffic scenarios, and they reveal the thresholds for adaptive activation of RFIDImpulse based on traffic load...|$|E

Here, multiple remote sensor nodes estimate a physical process (for example, a moving object) and transmit quantized estimates to a fusion center for processing.

A unique feature of this work is that instead of merely allowing a greedy minimization of uncertainty in each time instance, the lifetime of the wireless sensor network is improved by incorporating a heuristic scaling on the operating capability of each node. This heuristic in turn depends on the remaining energy, equivalent to the past history of power and quantization decisions. Simulation results demonstrate the quality of the state estimate as well as the extended lifetime of the network when power and quantization levels are dynamically updated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{are gaining}} popularity {{in different areas}} of applications like industrial monitoring, military applications, home automation, smart grid applications, body organ monitoring, etc. A WSN is a wireless network comprising {{of a number of}} devices, called sensor nodes. A sensor node, usually battery powered, is capable of detecting physical phenomena, such as light, temperature, movement, noise, pressure, humidity, etc. Medium access control (MAC) protocols are in a key role for determining the energy efﬁciency of a WSN, which is a key design issue for battery <b>operated</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes. Alongside energy efﬁciency, reliable transmission is also always preferred in communication networks. The IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard provides low power solutions to the WSN applications by specifying physical and MAC layer functions for low rate wireless personal area networks. In this thesis, Markov chain models are derived to study the throughput and the energy consumption of IEEE 802. 15. 4 MAC taking into account the packet corruption by both collisions and channel errors. An increase in reliability reduces retransmissions of erroneous packets, which in turn reduces the energy consumption. Therefore, a network with low energy consumption and high reliability is always desired. Wireless radio channel is the medium used for the transmissions in WSNs and it is error prone leading to received data corruption. To mitigate this inﬂuence of channel to some extent, forward error correction (FEC) may be employed. FEC provides error correction with the addition of redundant bits to the original message. Various FEC codes are analysed to study the inﬂuence of coding on the performance of the IEEE 802. 15. 4 type networks. Along with the FEC, inﬂuence of data frame payload size on performance is also studied. Numerical analyses are carried out and illustrated using Matlab. The results show that the performance of an IEEE 802. 15. 4 type network can be improved using an appropriate choice of payload size and FEC...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{last decade}} {{has been really}} ambitious in new {{research}} and development techniques to reduce energy consumption especially in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Sensor nodes are usually battery-powered and thus have very limited lifetime. Energy efficiency {{has been the most}} important aspect to discuss when talking about wireless body area network (WBAN) in particular, since it is the bottleneck of these networks. Medium access control (MAC) protocols hold the vital position to determine the energy efficiency of a WBAN, which is a key design issue for battery <b>operated</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes. The wake-up radio (WUR) based MAC and physical layer (PHY) have been evaluated in this research work in order to contribute to the energy efficient solutions development. WUR is an on-demand approach in which the node is woken up by the wake-up signal (WUS). A WUS switches a node from sleep mode to wake up mode to start signal transmission and reception. The WUS is transmitted or received by a secondary radio transceiver, which operates on very low power. The energy benefit of using WUR is compared with conventional duty-cycling approach. As the protocol defines the nodes in WUR based network do not waste energy on idle listening and are only awakened when there is a request for communication, therefore, energy consumption is extremely low. The performance of WUR based MAC protocol has been evaluated for both physical layer (PHY) and MAC for transmission of WUS and data. The probabilities of miss detection, false alarm and detection error rates are calculated for PHY and the probabilities of collision and successful data transmission for channel access method Aloha is evaluated. The results are obtained to compute and compare the total energy consumption of WUR based network with duty cycling. The results prove that the WUR based networks have significant potential to improve energy efficiency, in comparison to conventional duty cycling approach especially, in the case of low data-reporting rate applications. The duty cycle approach is better than WUR approach when sufficiently low duty cycle is combined with highly frequent communication between the network nodes...|$|E
