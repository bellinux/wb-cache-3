40|$|The {{isentropic}} {{efficiency of}} positive-displacement compressors may be improved {{in order to}} follow an increasing demand for energy savings. This work analyzes the thermal effect of the lubricating oil presence in the air during compression with the scope of exploiting it as a thermal ballast to mitigate both the gas temperature rise and its compression work. The bibliographic review shows that other authors suggested that oil can have positive effects if properly injected. Here an energy balance analysis is executed with the scope of deriving relations for the gas-liquid compression in analogy with those typical for the gas-only compression and of confirming that ideally the liquid presence may have beneficial effects, making the gas-liquid compression even better than 1 - and 2 -time intercooled gas compressions. Given these positive results, a heat transfer analysis is conducted to model the thermal interaction between gas and oil droplets within a mid-size rotary vane air compressor. A droplet diameter {{of the order of}} 100 μm leads to large reductions of both temperature increase and compression work: air can exit the discharge port at a temperature as low as 60 °C and compression work can be lowered by 23 - 28 % with respect to conventional compressors.

The {{influence}} of the <b>oil</b> supply, <b>nozzle</b> type, air supply, the performance of sliding friction element under the lubrication preloads were investigated by measuring the element’s temperature and friction coefficient based on the M 2000 -A friction wear testing machine. When the load, rotating speed and air supply is at 1500 N, 210 rpm and 2. 25 m 3 /h level respectively, as the oil supply is increased, the temperature rises and friction coefficient decreases. The temperature rise decreases monotonically. The friction coefficient rises monotonically with the air supply increases when the air supply is less than 2. 4 m 3 /h, but when the air supply is more than 2. 4 m 3 /h, the friction coefficient decreases monotonically. Furthermore, when the oil supply is reached 15 ml/h, they remain almost unchanged regardless of direct nozzle and conical nozzle.

The performance of conventional diesel fuel (CDF) and various percentages of diesel blended with palm oil-based biodiesel is also studied to evaluate their performance.

40|$|Problems of {{combustion}} instability {{and the need}} for wider range in firing rates have drawn attention to the need for more fundamental knowledge of the performance and the characteristics of pressure-jet atomized oil flames. A secondary problem is the complication and inconvenience of measurements on full scale equipment. In the present study various operational conditions for a typical modern burner with a pressure-jet atomizer and a swirled air supply were investigated. The variables chosen were fuel rate and spray angle. Data obtained consisted of gas composition, velocity and temperature measurements. The development of a laboratory unit was considered desirable to provide a means of facilitating measurements on flames of this type and a rig was constructed which consisted of a suitable combustion box and 3 / 10 ths scale burner. It was shown that the matching of the spray angle to the air register aerodynamics affected the flame characteristics very markedly, Regions of high unburnt fuel occurred due to fuel penetration and poor mixing outside and downstream of {{the main part of the}} flame. The effect of widening the spray angle which usually occurs with wide range types of pressure-jet atomizers at the lower fuel rates was shown to be particularly unsatisfactory, and to effect the black smoke limit. The general course of mixing and the progress of combustion through the flame was deduced from calculation from the gas composition results. The distribution and effects of recirculation were shown from the velocity measurements. These were related to data for simple jets. In particular, it was deduced that internal recirculation in the core was largely responsible for flame stabilization. Theoretically derived scaling criteria were investigated by comparing full scale and model results. These showed that reasonable comparisons were possible between the two, with flames scaled either on the basis of similarity in velocity and relative momentum between spray and air, or on similarity in residence times in the flame. The former was thought probably to be better, Cold flow measurements were made, and showed differences in the size of the central recirculation core between hot and cold but not in the peak velocity to peak velocity diameter early in the flame. Combustion oscillation measurements on a marine boiler produced data which suggested strongly that these were of the "non-acoustic" type. None of the theories so far suggested appear to - ii - account with much accuracy for the observed data. In the course of experimental work various special Instruments for flow measurement were developed. It was concluded that the choice of spray distribution to suit a particular aerodynamic pattern was vital to the optimum performance of the burner. In all the cases investigated this was found to be to some extent imperfect. It is considered that decided improvements could be made to the air distribution in burners of this type. The following possibilities are suggested solutions, the use of a higher degree of swirl and a confining quarl, upstream air injection or the use of multiple <b>oil</b> <b>nozzles</b> and by avoiding devices where the spray angle varies widely over the operating range...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} with {{this project was}} to study possible pressure dependency of droplet formation {{in case of a}} subsea blow out of oil and the effectiveness of subsea dispersant injection (SSDI). The droplet sizes documented by the SINTEF Silhouette Camera from comparable experiments (<b>nozzle,</b> <b>oil</b> type, flow rates, injection techniques and dispersant product) at ambient conditions (5 meters depth) and high pressure conditions (175 bar or 1750 meters depth) show no significant difference in droplet sizes as a function of pressure. This lack of a pressure effect was observed for both formation of large droplets from untreated oil and formation of smaller droplets by dispersant injection (1 and 2 % dispersant dosage). This strongly indicates that SSDI effectiveness is not significantly influenced by hydrostatic pressure. These experiments were performed using stabilized dead oil without gas.

However, biodiesel fuel has recognized by many researcher as a potential replacement of fossil fuel. A study was conducted to investigate the performance of alternative energy sources that are environmentally friendly and renewable such as palm biodiesel. Therefore, this project presents an investigation on the combustion performance of Palm Methyl Ester (PME) which also known as Palm Biodiesel in an oil burner system. Several Carotino’s palm biodiesel blends (B 10, B 20, and B 40) also have been made by blended with Conventional Diesel Fuel (CDF). Examination of the fuel properties for each blends including CDF and PME have been carried out. The performance of the fuels have been studied based on its wall temperature profile and gas emissions generated such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO).

The bottom of the firebox is open to atmospheric pressure, but covered by fire grates (solid fuel) or a firing pan (liquid fuel). If the engine burns solid fuel, like wood or coal, there is a grate covering most of {{the bottom of the}} firebox to hold the fire. An ashpan, mounted underneath the firebox and below the grates, catches and collects hot embers, ashes, and other solid combustion waste as it falls through the grates. In a coal-burning locomotive, the grates may be shaken to clean dead ash {{from the bottom of the}} fire. They are shaken either manually or (in larger locomotives) by a powered grate shaker. Wood-burning locomotives have fixed grates that can't be shaken. Wood ash is generally powder which will fall through the grates with no more agitation required than the vibrations of the locomotive rolling down the track. The fire grates must be replaced periodically due to the extreme heat they must endure. Combustion air enters through the bottom of the firebox and airflow is usually controlled by damper doors above the ash collection pocket of the ash pan. A locomotive that burns liquid fuel - usually [...] "Bunker C" [...] fuel oil or similar heavy oil - does not have grates. Instead, they have a heavy metal gauge firing pan bolted tight against the bottom of the firebox. The firing pan is covered with firebrick and the firebox has a firebrick lining, usually up to the level of the firebox door, all the way around the firebox.
