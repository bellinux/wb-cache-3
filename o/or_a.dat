30|$|Couto et al. (2005) {{identified}} 7 Or {{genes that}} were only expressed in the maxillary palp (MP) (MP-specific) and 11 Or genes {{that were only}} expressed in the larval stage (larva-specific). Among the seven MP-specific genes, six (Or 33 c, <b>Or</b> 42 <b>a,</b> <b>Or</b> 46 <b>a,</b> <b>Or</b> 71 <b>a,</b> <b>Or</b> 85 d, and Or 85 e) were expressed in our transcriptomes from adult antennae {{of at least one}} sex (with an FPKM of > 0.05). However, most of the 6 genes were expressed at very low levels (at an FPKM of < 1) except <b>Or</b> 46 <b>a,</b> which was expressed at FPKMs of 13.47 in males and 11.71 in females. We therefore concluded that the previously identified MP-specific expression pattern was due to the extremely low expression levels in antennae. Among the 11 larva-specific genes identified by Couto et al. (2005), 5 (<b>Or</b> 24 <b>a,</b> <b>Or</b> 30 <b>a,</b> <b>Or</b> 45 <b>a,</b> <b>Or</b> 59 <b>a,</b> and <b>Or</b> 94 b) showed no expression in our transcriptomes (at an FPKM of < 0.05). The other 6 genes (Or 22 c, Or 33 b, <b>Or</b> 63 <b>a,</b> <b>Or</b> 74 <b>a,</b> <b>Or</b> 83 <b>a,</b> and <b>Or</b> 85 c) showed very low expression levels in adult antennae (see Additional file 1 : Table S 5 for details).|$|R

5|$|Cricket was {{probably}} devised by children and survived for many generations as essentially a children's game.
