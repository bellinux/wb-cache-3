50|$|Camelina is a genus {{within the}} {{flowering}} plant family Brassicaceae. The Camelina species, {{commonly known as}} false flax, are native to Mediterranean regions of Europe and Asia. Most species of this genus have been little studied, {{with the exception of}} Camelina sativa, historically cultivated as oil plant. Heinrich Johann Nepomuk von Crantz was the first botanist to use the genus Camelina in his classification works in 1762. As a way to reduce fossil fuel emissions, the US Navy tested a 50-50 mix of jet aviation fuel and biofuel derived from camelina seeds in 2010. A study published in December 2016 explained that the current low price of conventional kerosene-based jet fuel makes it cost-prohibitive for commercial airlines to use camelina-based jet fuel.

5000|$|<b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> {{quasi-periodic}} patterns is {{to create}} a Penrose tiling. Girih tiles can be subdivided into Penrose tiles called [...] "dart" [...] and [...] "kite", but {{there is no evidence that}} this approach was used by medieval artisans. Another way to create quasiperiodic patterns is by subdividing girih tiles repeatedly into smaller girih tiles using a subdivision rule. In the limit the plane would be divided into girih tiles that repeat with frequencies that are aperiodic. The use of such a subdivision rule would have been evidence that Islamic artisans of the 15th century were aware that girih tiles can produce patterns that never exactly repeat themselves. However, all known girih patterns made with girih tiles show no more than a two-level design. In fact, there would have been no practical need to have a girih pattern that had more than two levels of design, because a third level would have a scale either too large or too small to be perceived. It appears that medieval Islamic artisans were using a tool that had the potential of creating highly complex patterns, but they never realized it. As E. Makovicky argues, The artisans were satisfied by creating a large fundamental domain without being concerned with the mathematical notion of indefinitely expandable quasiperiodic patterns. However, they understood and used to their advantage some of the local geometric properties of the quasi-crystalline patterns they constructed.|$|E

Næss & Høyer’s paper The Emperor’s Green Clothes: Growth, Decoupling, and Capitalism (2009) offers a theoretical approach to the global possibilities of decoupling.

The question of who raises and educates our children {{is not only an}} American debate, but is asked all over the western world. This is not only due to the results of PISA, but also prompted by our changing societies and, especially, the decline of traditional families. Today learning and education are not “leaving” schools, but families.

Furthermore, this is usually done in an ad-hoc manner and for pre-defined situations. In this paper, we propose an approach, supported by a tool, that creates situational methods semi-automatically. This approach refers to structural and behavioral considerations and a wide variety of characteristics when comparing method components and composing them into situational methods.
