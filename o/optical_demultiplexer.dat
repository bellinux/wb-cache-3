40|$|A {{thermally}} tunable 1 × 4 channel <b>optical</b> <b>demultiplexer</b> {{was designed}} using an ultra low-loss Si 3 N 4 (propagation loss ~ 3. 1 dB/m) waveguide. The demultiplexer has three 2 × 2 Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI), where {{each of the}} MZI contains two 2 × 2 general interference based multimode interference (MMI) couplers. The MMI couplers exhibit − 3. 3 dB to − 3. 7 dB power division ratios over a 50 nm wavelength range from 1530 nm to 1580 nm.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{investigation}} {{on how to}} reduce the internode communication latency in distributed multiprocessor systems. The strategy consists of replacing the "store and forward" mechanism that is usually carried out on each electronic node by a free diffusion of optical packets along an optical bus.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} associated with high-speed optical time division multiplexed soliton transmission systems is the timing jitter error associated with individual soliton pulses. The two physical effects that cause soliton jitters are the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise in in- line optical amplifiers and soliton interaction. While soliton interaction is negligible when the duty cycle of transmitted pulses is small enough, the root-mean-square (rms) soliton jitter due to culminated ASE noise is a fundamental factor that limits the bit-rate distance product in high-speed long-haul data transmission systems. Soliton jitter is detrimental to all-optical time division demultiplexing as it would manifest itself into a relative intensity noise in the data recovery process at the optical receiver. This paper investigates the possibility of minimizing the ASE-induced soliton jitter by changing the spacing between in-line optical amplifiers. It is found that the rms soliton jitter decreases with the amplifier spacing and the minimum soliton jitter can be attained {{in the case of}} distributed amplification. These results have significant implications to all-optical time division demultiplexing in the sense of taking into account the amplifier spacing in the process of optimizing system parameters to achieve minimum power penalty of the all-optical demultiplexer.

Manipulation of {{the flow}} of light is demanded for several applications such as communication, data storage, sensor, photovoltaic cells, microscopy, lasers and light emitting diodes for the purpose of designing compact, high-throughput and high efficiency optical devices. Nevertheless, the control of the propagation of the light becomes much harder in devices with smaller geometries mostly because of diffractions, loss mechanisms and fabrication difficulties. Furthermore, materials that are already available in the nature do not provide unprecedented optical properties for nanoscale optical applications. Due to this fact that fabrication of artificial materials is needed for utilizing novel and intriguing optical devices. For this purpose, some relatively new research fields have emerged like photonic crystals, metamaterials and high contrast gratings. We propose several designs based on aforementioned meta-structures to achieve compact and practically realizable optical devices. We presented compact <b>optical</b> <b>demultiplexer,</b> diode-like device and electro-optic modulator designs that are based on photonic crystals. We also proposed two circular polarizer designs based on metamaterials and high contrast gratings. Further, we investigated unidirectional transmission and polarization manipulation properties in chiral metamaterials. For most of the proposed designs, we also experimentally verified the numerical and theoretical findings. In conclusion, we can claim that the utilization of artifically structured materials give opportunity to realize the control of light much more easily in nanoscale designs. Akosman, Ahmet EminM.
