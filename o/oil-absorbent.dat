40|$|Abstract. Experiment {{uses the}} Suspension Polymerization, under the dual {{oxidation-reduction}} system of H 2 O 2 -xanthate and H 2 O 2 -FeSO 4 initiating, the lipophilic- monomer of BMA is grafted {{on the frame}} of cotton fiber which prepares <b>oil-absorbent</b> fiber. It has studied the adsorption kinetics, adsorption transfer and isothermal absorption model of the <b>oil-absorbent</b> fiber for the oily wastewater under 25 ÂºC. The result shows that the adsorption kinetics of the <b>oil-absorbent</b> fiber for the oily wastewater accords with pseudo second order kinetic model, it could get that the initial swelling rate is increase with stirring speed increasing from fitting. Particles internal diffusion model analyzing shows that the diffusion rate of external diffusion and particles internal diffusion are similar, increasing the stirring speed could increase the internal diffusion rate and external diffusion rate. Increasing the stirring speed could increase capacity mass transfer rate and it benefits to absorb. The absorbing of <b>oil-absorbent</b> fiber for oily wastewater accords with Langmuir and Freundlich isothermal absorption model...|$|E

The polymerization {{conditions and the}} structure and characteristics were investigated in detail. The absorption for chloroform and xylene were examined, and {{the results indicated that}} the prepared resin had higher oil absorbency compared with traditional <b>oil-absorbent</b> materials [15].|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The high oil-absorbing resin is a {{new type}} {{functional}} polymer material. The recent development of high <b>oil-absorbent</b> resin and its properties and synthesis were introduced in this reviewpaper. The absorption principle and process of highoil-absorbent resin are also presented. The effect of monomer, crosslinking agent and pore forming agent on high oil-absorption properties of oil-absorbing resin is investigated. At last, the present applications of the high oil-absorbing resin in environmental protection and other industrial purpose are also mentioned. Foreword Since {{the beginning of the}} new century, the development of global industrial had accelerated evidently, and, inevitably, more and more depends on the adequate supply of oil. However, several serious problems, such as oil spill accidents of oil tankers, and the disordered emissions of oily wastewater, have cropped up, which laid hidden dangers to human survival and development in the future [1]. Therefore, It was rather necessary to achieve those materials of excellent oil-absorbing performance, also becoming a major research topic. And, especially, there was no doubt that the development of high oil absorption resins became the biggest hotspot. Traditional inorganic materia...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{catechol}} derivatives {{with a different}} number of linear alkyl chain substituents, and different length, {{have been shown to}} polymerize in the presence of aqueous ammonia and air, yielding hydrophobic coatings that present the ability to provide robust and efficient water repellency on weaved textiles, including hydrophilic cotton. The polymerization strategy presented exemplifies an alternative route to established melanin- and polydopamine-like functional coatings, affording designs in which all catechol (adhesive) moieties support specific functional side chains for maximization of the desired (hydrophobic) functionality. The coatings obtained proved effective in the transformation of polyester and cotton weaves, as well as filter paper, into reusable water-repellent, <b>oil-absorbent</b> materials capable of retaining roughly double their weight in model compounds (n-tetradecane and olive oil), as well as of separating water/oil mixtures by simple filtration.

30|$|With the {{development}} of modern industry, the environmental pollution caused by organic solvent {{became more and more}} serious. In addition, the accidents of leakage of crude oil occurring frequently are endangering the marine life and human. Thus, the removal of organic solvent and oil from water and soil is still an urgent project. The commonly used method for removing organic solvent is absorption due to its simple operation and cheap cost. Thus, the synthesis of high absorbent has received {{a great deal of attention}} [1, 2, 3]. The synthesis methods have been investigated using various techniques, in which emulsion polymerization [4, 5] and suspension polymerization [6] were used mostly. Emulsion polymerization is making the monomer dispersed in water into the emulsion with the emulsifier and mechanical agitation, and then the polymerization reaction is triggered by the initiator. Up to now, the initiation methods involved chemical initiators, such as persulphate [7] and redox [8], ultrasonic initiation [9], and photoinduction [10]. Recently, the acrylic resin has received a great deal of attention due to its multiple <b>oil-absorbent</b> species and high oil absorbency. However, the synthetic resin with acrylic ester as monomer after swelling has became soft, so addition of styrene as comonomer not only can increase the strength of the resin but also reduce the cost of the resin.|$|E
