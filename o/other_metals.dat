5|$|Cadmium is a soft, malleable, ductile, bluish-white {{divalent}} metal. It {{is similar}} in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds. Unlike most <b>other</b> <b>metals,</b> cadmium is resistant to corrosion and {{is used as a}} protective plate on <b>other</b> <b>metals.</b> As a bulk metal, cadmium is insoluble in water and is not flammable; however, in its powdered form it may burn and release toxic fumes.|$|E

50|$|Metal {{fluorides}} have similarities with <b>other</b> <b>metal</b> halides but {{are more}} ionic. In many respects, metal fluorides differ from <b>other</b> <b>metal</b> halides (chlorides, bromides, iodides), {{very similar to}} each other.

5|$|Hafnium {{is used in}} alloys with iron, titanium, niobium, tantalum, and <b>other</b> <b>metals.</b> An alloy {{used for}} liquid rocket {{thruster}} nozzles, for example the main engine of the Apollo Lunar Modules, is C103 which consists of 89% niobium, 10% hafnium and 1% titanium.|$|E

5|$|Silver {{is usually}} {{found in nature}} {{combined}} with <b>other</b> <b>metals,</b> or in minerals that contain silver compounds, generally {{in the form of}} sulfides such as galena (lead sulfide) or cerussite (lead carbonate). So the primary production of silver requires the smelting and then cupellation of argentiferous lead ores, a historically important process. Lead melts at 327°C, lead oxide at 888°C and silver melts at 960°C. To separate the silver, the alloy is melted again at the high temperature of 960°C to 1000°C in an oxidizing environment. The lead oxidises to lead monoxide, then known as litharge, which captures the oxygen from the <b>other</b> <b>metals</b> present. The liquid lead oxide is removed or absorbed by capillary action into the hearth linings.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} {{have many}} applications, {{the most well-known}} being sodium chloride as table salt. Sodium salts of fatty acids are used as soap. Pure sodium metal also has many applications, including use in sodium-vapour lamps, which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting, and can help smooth the surface of <b>other</b> <b>metals.</b> Being a strong reducing agent, it {{is often used to}} reduce many <b>other</b> <b>metals,</b> such as titanium and zirconium, from their chlorides. Furthermore, it is very useful as a heat-exchange liquid in fast breeder nuclear reactors due to its low melting point, viscosity, and cross-section towards neutron absorption.|$|E
5|$|Thallium iodide is {{frequently}} {{used as an}} additive in metal-halide lamps, often together {{with one or two}} halides of <b>other</b> <b>metals.</b> It allows optimization of the lamp temperature and color rendering, and shifts the spectral output to the green region, which is useful for underwater lighting.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most materials, {{plutonium}} {{increases in}} density when it melts, by 2.5%, but the liquid metal exhibits a linear decrease in density with temperature. Near the melting point, the liquid plutonium has very high viscosity and surface tension compared to <b>other</b> <b>metals.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to the United States Geological Survey, {{the world}} mining {{production}} of bismuth in 2014 was 13,600 tonnes, {{with the major}} contributions from China (7,600 tonnes), Vietnam (4,950 tonnes) and Mexico (948 tonnes). The refinery production in 2010 was 16,000 tonnes, of which China produced 13,000, Mexico 850 and Belgium 800 tonnes. The difference reflects bismuth's status as a byproduct of extraction of <b>other</b> <b>metals</b> such as lead, copper, tin, molybdenum and tungsten.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metals form ionic {{and highly}} soluble monofluorides; these have the cubic {{arrangement}} of sodium chloride and analogous chlorides. Alkaline earth difluorides possess strong ionic bonds but are insoluble in water, {{with the exception}} of beryllium difluoride, which also exhibits some covalent character and has a quartz-like structure. Rare earth elements and many <b>other</b> <b>metals</b> form mostly ionic trifluorides.|$|E

30|$|To further {{evaluate}} the selectivity, the Hg 2 + detection {{in the presence}} of <b>other</b> <b>metal</b> ions was investigated. The fluorescence responses of BSA-GNPs to different concentrations of Hg 2 + in mixture solutions were obtained in Fig. S 5. The results indicated that the fluorescent intensity of BSA-GNPs still showed a gradual decrease with the concentration of Hg 2 + increasing coexisting with <b>other</b> <b>metal</b> ions in solution 1. Compared with mixture solution 1 (Fig. S 5 a), the fluorescent intensity of BSA-GNPs decreased a lot coexisting with Cu 2 +, Pb 2 + and Ni 2 + (Fig. S 5 b), but it did not affect the detection of Hg 2 +. Though <b>other</b> <b>metal</b> ions coexisted, the experimental results show that Hg 2 + can be detected against <b>other</b> heavy <b>metals.</b>|$|R

5|$|Alternatively {{pig iron}} {{may be made}} into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various {{processes}} {{have been used for}} this, including finery forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer converters, open hearth furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize {{some or all of the}} carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, <b>other</b> <b>metals</b> may be added to make alloy steels.|$|E
5|$|Because of titanium's {{superior}} {{strength and}} light weight relative to <b>other</b> <b>metals</b> (steel, stainless steel, and aluminium), {{and because of}} recent advances in metalworking techniques, its use has become more widespread {{in the manufacture of}} firearms. Primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders. For the same reasons, it is used in the body of laptop computers (for example, in Apple's PowerBook line).|$|E
5|$|Gallium attacks most <b>other</b> <b>metals</b> by {{diffusing}} {{into the}} metal lattice. For example, it diffuses into the grain boundaries of aluminium-zinc alloys and steel, making them very brittle.
