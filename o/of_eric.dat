5|$|Bradman put Warwickshire in to bat on a wet {{pitch and}} the hosts {{struggled}} to 138 in an innings that lasted almost 80 overs. Martin Donnelly (28) {{was the only}} batsman to pass 20, and Lindwall and Johnson took three wickets each. Australia scored 254 in reply; Hassett top-scored with 68, Lindwall made 45, and the pair's partnership of 70 was the highest of the match. Three other batsmen reached 30, {{but most of the}} Australians were uncomfortable against the leg spin <b>of</b> <b>Eric</b> Hollies, who opened the bowling and took 8/107, the best innings analysis against the Australians on the whole tour. This performance earned the Warwickshire bowler a call-up for the fifth and final Test. In their second innings Warwickshire made 155 runs, Johnston and McCool taking four wickets each, the former conceding only 32 from 39 overs. Australia made the required 41 by lunch on the third day.|$|E
5|$|Dissenting {{religious}} practitioners also widely {{resented the}} treatment {{they received from}} the Lutheran State Church through the Conventicle Act. Conflicts between local worshipers and the new churches were most explosive in the countryside, where dissenting pietist groups were more active, and were more directly under the eye of local law enforcement and the parish priest. Before non-Lutheran churches were granted toleration in 1809, clampdowns on illegal forms of worship and teaching often provoked whole groups of pietists to leave together, intent on forming their own spiritual communities in the new land. The largest contingent of such dissenters, 1,500 followers <b>of</b> <b>Eric</b> Jansson, left in the late 1840s and founded a community in Bishop Hill, Illinois.|$|E
