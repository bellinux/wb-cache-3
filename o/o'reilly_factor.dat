2500|$|Following {{the opening}} sequence, Colbert most often {{proceeds}} with a run-through of recent headlines {{in a manner}} parodying traditional news broadcasts; {{this is similar to}} The Daily Show but with a faux-right-wing spin. The program typically continues with Colbert addressing a specific topic. Colbert often calls to [...] "Jimmy", a reference to program director Jim Hoskinson, to roll video clips. That topic will often lead into a [...] "The Word" [...] segment, which juxtaposes Colbert's commentary with satirical bullet points on-screen, a parody of The <b>O'Reilly</b> <b>Factors</b> [...] "Talking Points Memo". On occasion he will conduct a short interview with someone {{having to do with the}} topic. The format of the middle segment varies, but it is normally a visual presentation or skit. Often, these skits are parts of recurring segments, which may include [...] "Better Know a District", in which Colbert interviews a U.S. Representative from a certain district of the United States; [...] "Tip of the Hat/Wag of the Finger", in which Colbert voices his approval or disapproval of prominent people and news items; [...] "Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, D.F.A.", a health segment; [...] "The Sport Report" [...] with the [...] "t" [...] in both Sport and Report silent, a sports segment; and [...] "The ThreatDown", in which Colbert lists the five greatest threats to America, and others.

5|$|In 2005, Colbert left The Daily Show {{to host a}} {{spin-off}} series entitled The Colbert Report, {{a parody}} of personality-driven political pundit programs such as Fox News's The <b>O'Reilly</b> <b>Factor</b> that center largely on the personal views of their hosts. Because of this enlarged role, the personality and beliefs of the Stephen Colbert character have become more clearly defined {{over the course of}} the show, complete with a fictitious backstory that has been revealed piecemeal in short monologues accompanying a part of the program.|$|E
25|$|Early in 2009, the show's ratings {{increase}}d.

5000|$|Using {{his former}} blog, CallingAllWingnuts.com, as an {{organizing}} tool, Stark recruited {{a team of}} individuals willing to volunteer time calling into various conservative radio shows. [...] The first call-in campaign was directed at Bill <b>O'Reilly's</b> Radio <b>Factor.</b> It {{was a response to}} O'Reilly's creation of a petition on his website that called for the replacement of Keith Olbermann and cancellation of his show, Countdown with Keith Olbermann. Stark encouraged callers to tell O'Reilly how much they enjoyed Olbermann's television show. Over the course of the week, approximately 15 callers that Stark recruited were put on the air with O'Reilly. As they mentioned Olbermann's name, they were disconnected by the host, with O'Reilly threatening to send the number to [...] "Fox security" [...] to contact [...] "local authorities" [...] if they say anything [...] "obscene or untoward." ...|$|R
30|$|No {{selected}} bacterium that is able {{to inhibit}} tumor growth completely, mainly by two reasons: (1) inflammatory reaction (mainly by neutrophils) and relatively high oxygen levels at the viable rim restrain the spread of obligate anaerobes; and (2) the outer layer of tumor tissue was unaffected, in which the tumor cells rapidly proliferate and invade surrounding tissues {{with the support of}} tumor vasculatures. Here, we confer Salmonella with limited ability to spread beyond the anaerobic regions of tumors to target blood vessels with bacterial expressed an angiogenic inhibitor, Endostatin, which are secreted through a type III secretion system (T 3 SS) to interfere with the pro-angiogenic action of growth <b>factors</b> (<b>O’Reilly</b> et al. 1997). We used the engineered S. typhimurium strain ST 8 to deliver Endostatin fused with a type III secretion protein SopA in order to efficiently secrete by bacteria and diffuse through tumor tissue. The ability to diffuse through the tissues will augment therapeutic effects, and enable repression of blood vessels in the cancer cell proliferating regions.|$|R

25|$|Following {{the pardon}} by President Bill Clinton of several convicted {{members of the}} New Square Hassidic community, Greenwald was interviewed by several media outlets {{regarding}} his opinion and even {{his role in the}} affair. The fact that Greenwald had ties to the New Square community, was a former business associate of Marc Rich, another person pardoned by Clinton {{at the end of his}} term and had been questioned by the FBI during its investigation into the pardons, made his opinions regarding the incident highly sought after by media outlets. On March 12, 2001, on The Edge, Paula Zahn conducted a 10-minute interview with Greenwald. He also appeared on The <b>O'Reilly</b> <b>Factor</b> on October 10, 2002, when he was cross examined by host Bill O'Reilly for several minutes regarding the affair. In both interviews, Greenwald conceded that the New Square community probably voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in her race against Rick Lazio for U.S. Senate in 2000 with some expectation that some consideration be given to pardoning the members of the New Square community. However, he steadfastly maintained that there had been no quid pro quo or agreement to exchange votes for a pardon.|$|E

500|$|Colbert hosted his own {{television}} show, The Colbert Report, from October 17, 2005, through December 18, 2014. The Colbert Report was a Daily Show spin-off that parodied {{the conventions}} of television news broadcasting, particularly cable-personality political talk shows like The <b>O'Reilly</b> <b>Factor,</b> Hannity, and Glenn Beck. Colbert hosted the show in-character as a blustery right-wing pundit, {{generally considered to be}} an extension of his character on The Daily Show. Conceived by co-creators Stewart, Colbert, and Ben Karlin in part as an opportunity to explore [...] "the character-driven news", the series focused less on the day-to-day news style of the Daily Show, instead frequently concentrating on the foibles of the host-character himself.|$|E

[...] The series became one of Comedy Central's highest-rated series, earning Colbert an invitation to perform as featured entertainer at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in 2006.

In his in-character appearance on The <b>O'Reilly</b> <b>Factor,</b> Colbert stated that he is of Irish descent and only adopted the French pronunciation of his surname to [...] "get the cultural elites" [...] on his side. Colbert has made conflicting statements regarding his middle name, which he has at different times stated to be Tyrone (Colbert's actual middle name), Tiberius (like that of Captain James T. Kirk), Lee-Harvey, and Qxyzzy.|$|E
500|$|Stossel's style {{combines}} {{reporting and}} commentary. It reflects a libertarian political philosophy and views on economics which are largely {{supportive of the}} free market. He began his journalism career as a researcher for KGW-TV, was a consumer reporter at WCBS-TV in New York City, and then joined ABC News as a consumer editor and reporter on Good Morning America. Stossel went on to be an ABC News correspondent, joining the weekly news magazine program 20/20, going on to become co-anchor. In October 2009, Stossel left his long-time employment at ABC News to join the Fox Business Channel, as {{the host of a}} weekly news show on Fox Business, Stossel, which was broadcast from December 10, 2009, to December 16, 2016.

500|$|Conservative media figure Glenn Beck (who {{joined the}} LDS Church in 1999) has alleged that President Barack Obama [...] "is {{going to bring}} us to the verge of {{shredding}} the Constitution, of massive socialism."

[...] Earlier in November, while interviewing U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah (also a Mormon), Beck remarked: [...] "I heard Barack Obama talk about the Constitution and I thought, we are at the point or we are very near the point where our Constitution is hanging by a thread." [...] Hatch appeared on Beck's Fox News show in January 2009, and Beck prompted him by declaring [...] "I believe our Constitution hangs by a thread." ...|$|E
