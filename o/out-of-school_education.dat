40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the roles <b>out-of-school</b> <b>education</b> can play to enhance {{empowerment}} of different segments of rural adults in Etche ethnic nationality for community development. The educational history of Etche ethnic nationality reveals a disproportionate emphasis on formal/liberal education at the expense of <b>out-of-school</b> <b>education,</b> the resultant effect of which has been over production of school leavers without practical skills. Consequently, unemployment and poverty manifestations are high and relate to low levels of literacy and lack of vocational skills among the adults and youths. As a matter of fact, this situation demands intervention of <b>out-of-school</b> <b>education</b> which is capable of providing unlimited education opportunities for mobilizing the capacities of various sub-groups of people in Etche ethnic nationality towards rapid transformation of the communities.

40|$|In {{this article}} we explore the {{influence}} of the geographical proximity of <b>out-of-school</b> arts <b>education</b> provision on the individual decision of children and youngsters to enroll in an arts education course. The distance between the homes of the Belgian students in compulsory education and the nearest offer of <b>out-of-school</b> arts <b>education</b> (a network called: Part-Time Arts Education (PTAE)) is calculated on population-wide administrative data. The results show a negative and non-linear relation between distance and enrollment. Especially young children are affected by this. Students with a low socio-economic status (SES) are not affected more by this than other students. While students with a low SES live proportionally more in big cities, which are areas with a bigger density of arts education provision, our analysis shows they still participate less than other students. When students with a low SES do participate it is not in a course significantly nearer to their area of residence. As the distance to a specific PTAE course increases, {{only a small part of}} students are willing to substitute their choice of course into another course of study that is spatially closer. Therefore, distance is a barrier hard to overcome, and often closes of the opportunity to participate in arts education.

In the theoretical part I deal with the issues of education of Romany people including <b>out-of-school</b> <b>education,</b> then the specifics of a Romany family as the primary socializing factor. I specify selected forms of risky behaviour most frequently faced by the children. The Bachelor Thesis was aimed at describing the influence of the tutorial programme provided by the SaSM - DDM ČB on school results of Romany children and on their awareness of risky behaviour. The research results show that the tutorial programme only makes sense with regard to the school results if it is provided on long-term basis. However it has permanent influence on improvement of respondent?s self confidence, thanks to which the children are not afraid of putting their hands up in class and they also feel more successful. The Centre is also involved in the field of primary prevention of risky behaviour. The staff strives for teaching the respondents to use their free time in active and meaningful manners. The SaSM - DDM ČB offers an alternative to spending free time in risky manners.

It was operated through a triangle-based study of the intended curriculum, teachersa and studentsa views. The 10 th grade Syrian intended chemistry curriculum has been analyzed as a case based on an analysis of the official grade- 10 chemistry school textbook in comparison to six other chemistry textbooks from a purposeful sample of Arab countries, namely Algeria, Egypt, Kuwait, Palestine, Jordan and Saudi-Arabia. These countries are economically, societally, cultural and geographically diverse, but they all are part of the Arab world and use Arabic as a common language (Chapter 2). The second part of this study analyzed teachersa views on chemistry and physics teaching based on interviews. Instances of the interviews were the use of ICT, laboratory work, including the history of science in teaching, and the teachersa view on the national curriculum (Chapter 3).

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to gain insight into the factors {{correlated}} with active arts participation. Drawing on the cultural reproduction theory and the cultural mobility model, we assess the relative effects of level of education and art education versus social background and focus on possible interaction effects between them.

Results based on stepwise logistic regression analyses on representative population data for Flanders (N = 3, 146) offer a mixed picture. Although we find clear effects of social background on the odds of active arts participation, net effects of art education prove more substantial. However, the context of art education clearly matters: for most of the art forms considered, only <b>out-of-school</b> art <b>education</b> shows net effects, while in-school art education has no net effects. Furthermore, we find how the effects of level of education on active art participation are equally attributable to parental milieu and to art education programs. Finally, four significant interaction effects are found corroborating the cultural mobility model.

In 2012, Native Americans (i.e., American Indians and Alaskan Natives) were 1.7 % {{of the population}} (United States Census Bureau 2015) but accounted for only 0.6 % of bachelor’s degrees, 0.4 % of master’s degrees, and 0.2 % of doctoral degrees {{in science and engineering}} (National Science Foundation 2015). Many reasons have been asserted for the low participation rate of Native Americans in STEM disciplines, including lack of exposure, lack of interest, lack of confidence, lack of a feeling of belonging, and lack of goal congruency. For example, one factor may be the mismatch between the Native culture’s emphasis on communal work goals and the non-communal culture of STEM (Smith et al. 2014). Native American students who succeed in college do so “in part because they stayed engaged in their programs of study, often by finding meaningful connections between tribal beliefs and practices and the values and goals of American colleges,” but {{it can be difficult to}} find such connections in the STEM disciplines (Smith et al. 2014, p. 414). Further, many Native Americans have STEM knowledge that is rooted in naturalist traditions and arrived at through direct experience, and so, they may feel alienated by approaches to STEM that are not grounded in direct experience and denigrated by a system that appears to assume they know nothing about STEM (Cajete 2000; Nelson-Barber and Estrin 1995). Efforts to overcome these obstacles and increase Native American participation in STEM include in-school mentoring and <b>out-of-school</b> science <b>education</b> experiences which present science within culturally relevant frameworks (Stevens et al. 2016).|$|R

Out-of-school programs to increase physical activity and fitness in older Latino teens are critical, but sustained engagement is challenging. PurposeThis study combined a community-based participatory research methodology, Photovoice, with focus groups to engage Latina teens and their parents in identifying barriers to physical activity and initiating policy change actions to address them. The study investigates the effectiveness of applying Photovoice as both an evaluation tool and a leadership/advocacy intervention in a community-based obesity prevention program. DesignFocus group data were collected between July 2009 and October 2010 and analyzed between November 2010 and July 2011. Five focus groups were held with adults (n= 41 : 95 % Latino) and four with teens (n= 36 : 81 % Latino, 10 % non-Hispanic white, 9 % African-American). Setting/participantsAll participants (19 teens, six adults) were Latino. Spanish-speaking staff of a community-based agency, program staff, high school guidance counselors, and a job development agency recruited participants. Teens aged 14 – 19 years enrolled in New Britain CT, high schools, and their parents were eligible. Main outcome measuresData from Photovoice workshops (three with teens, two with parent–teen dyads) were collected and concurrently analyzed between July 2009 and August 2011.

In this chapter, however, we will deal with education in a much wider acceptation, namely all aspects of cultural transmission. Schooling is of course part of that, but education also includes informal learning, resulting from enculturation and socialization, that is, it proceeds informally in everyday situations, either through observation and imitation or active inculcation. As Bruner (1996 : ix) remarks: ‘ [...] . schooling is only one small part of how a culture inducts the young into its canonical ways. Indeed, schooling may even be at odds with a culture’s other ways of inducting the young into the requirements of communal living. ’ On the dimension of formal to informal, Ahmed (1983) distin-guished the following categories of education: 1. Formal education or schooling. 2. Non-formal, or <b>out-of-school</b> <b>education,</b> which includes all educa-tional programs aimed at those left out of formal education (very young children, the discards of the school system, young people in post-primary education, non-literates, and so on). 3.

The objective of my work is to describe approach of selected EU countries to injury prevention and map preventive measures in injury prevention in selected countries, including Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden, Italy, Germany and France. Prevention is targeted activity based on cognition that injury {{prevention is}} always simpler than dealing with irreversible consequences. Work objectives have been identified by work quantitative research methodology. I have been focused on government documents, legislative regulations as well as other documents dealing with injury prevention. Materials which were subject to secondary analysis were received from several main resources, including governmental, state and non-state institutions of selected EU countries. Due to inaccessibility of some documents or unsuitable or unfound resources, I have used complementary questioning method. I have addressed respondents living and working in selected EU countries. The issue of child injury prevention is on preference positions in political programs, takes place on all levels, including state, regional and local levels. States adopt national injury prevention action plans; approve legislative measures, such as speed in municipalities, use of cycling helmets by children, use of retaining systems. School and <b>out-of-school</b> traffic <b>education</b> is organized in all of the selected EU countries. It should begin already at pre-school age. Parents play significant role as well as state and non state institutions. The most complex program in the selected EU countries is called "Safe Communities". In all of the selected EU countries there are also other organisations which participate in preventive programs, events, trainings and campaigns. In addition other local authorities, administration bodies, organisations and communities of interest and individuals can be invited to cooperate and all these activities can be coordinated and interconnected. The issue of injury prevention must be dealt with continuously. Coordinated and consistent prevention of child injuries has positive impact on reduction of child injury rate and death rate.

The system approach involves studying not only the internal functional structure of the territory, buildings and structures, but also the analysis of the connections of out-of-school institutions with all urban buildings, with industrial enterprises and research organizations, with a network of public service institutions and with other educational establishments. Article purpose: to analyze theoretical research in the field of urban planning, which should be taken into account when developing principles and methods for optimizing the network of out-of-school educational institutions. Conclusions. The research found that the systematic approach implies relation of out-of-school educational institutions with all urban environment, as well as with industrial enterprises and research organizations, with a network of public service institutions and, most importantly, with other educational establishments. The formation of a network of out-of-school educational institutions directly depends on the tendency of the development of social-pedagogical programs and the reform of the educational sector as a whole. The main system properties of a network of out-of-school educational institutions were determined. It was found that the cooperation of the resources of <b>out-of-school</b> and general <b>education</b> institutions is one of the effective ways to develop continuing education.

Using feminist poststructural theory as a heuristic and analytical tool, I investigated the varying discourses youth authors engaged throughout their processes and products related to autobiographical DST. The ethnographic data for this dissertation were collected in an English Language Arts high school classroom, African American Literature, {{over the course of}} four months across fall semester 2012. The three case study findings chapters illustrate three non-dominant students’ approaches to negotiating their subjectivity within the school context across multiple school spaces. The findings from this study complicate notions of agency; namely the case studies demonstrate how diverse youth of color negotiated multiple and competing discourses when narrating stories of the self in relation to a perceived peer audience. More specifically, each case provides a detailed analysis of how Darius, Malcolm, and Gabriel, negotiated local and macro discourses related to Black masculinity, salient intersecting subjectivities for each. This study holds theoretical implications in establishing the importance of using poststructural feminist theories in combination with Critical Discourse Analysis of student processes and produced related to autobiographical storytelling by way of detecting the complex power relations youth navigate within the school context. Moreover, this study reports important implications regarding the utility of digital storytelling as a culturally responsive, multimodal, critical literacy practice that affords youth opportunities to draw on personally and culturally meaningful discourses (e. g., hip-hip music) as they compose digital representations in relation to local and macro discourse. Additionally, implications for English Language Arts practice encourage future examination of how youth author’s attentiveness to peer audience discourse demonstrate students’ facilities in composing narratives in relation to audience...|$|R
