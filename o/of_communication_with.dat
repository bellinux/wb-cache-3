5|$|After the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War, {{the army}} came to arm the most {{important}} place. For technical reasons (distance <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> bases) and because new places of historical interest were accessible, the top brass debated whether to transfer the postings of new recruits at Massada to a more appropriate place. It was Latrun that was finally chosen. In the 1980s, a commemorative site and a museum {{was built on the}} old police site. The complex has a wall listing all the names of the fallen soldiers since the War Of Independence, and a monument to the glory of the heroes and another for reverence. The museum has nearly 200 tanks and other armoured vehicles of many kinds.|$|E
5|$|Harold's brother Tostig and Harald Hardrada invaded Northumbria in September 1066 and {{defeated}} the local forces under Morcar and Edwin at the Battle of Fulford near York. King Harold received word of their invasion and marched north, defeating the invaders and killing Tostig and Hardrada on 25 September at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. The Norman fleet finally set sail two days later, landing in England at Pevensey Bay on 28 September. William {{then moved to}} Hastings, a few miles to the east, where he built a castle as a base of operations. From there, he ravaged the interior and waited for Harold's return from the north, refusing to venture far from the sea, his line <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> Normandy.|$|E

5|$|Sadler {{believed}} that mediums were {{a source of}} false comfort and, after World WarI ended, fought against the increased popularity <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> the dead. In the 1910s and 1920s, attempting to expose purported clairvoyants became one of Sadler's favorite pastimes and he regularly worked with a Northwestern University psychologist and Howard Thurston, then a prominent magician, while investigating psychics. Sadler may have met the magician Harry Houdini (who was also a skeptic) around this time.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} fire rapidly increased, when enemy {{vehicles}} {{could be seen}} moving towards the villa from the nearby woods; this in particular worried Frost, as the radio sets the force had been issued failed to work, giving him no means <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> his other detachments, including 'Nelson' who were tasked with clearing the evacuation beach. Fortunately for the British, Flight Sergeant Cox and several sappers arrived at this time and proceeded to dismantle the radar equipment, placing the pieces on specially designed trolleys.|$|E
5|$|Whatever {{the exact}} {{course of events}} of the early 9th century, {{the failure of the}} Slavic attack on Patras {{consolidated}} the recently re-established Byzantine control over the Peloponnese, and Nikephoros I's policies led to the successful re-Christianization and Hellenization of the peninsula. The defence of Patras also secured the Byzantine Empire's main maritime road <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> Italy and the West, as it opened up the shorter route through the Corinthian Gulf, instead of the longer, more dangerous route around the Peloponnese that was exposed to Arab attacks.|$|E

5|$|According {{to flight}} attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong, who {{contacted}} American Airlines during the hijacking, the hijackers had stabbed flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui and slashed {{the throat of}} passenger Daniel Lewin. Lewin, an American-Israeli Internet entrepreneur who understood Arabic, had served as {{an officer in the}} elite Sayeret Matkal special operations unit of the Israel Defense Forces. Lewin was seated in 9B, and Suqami was directly behind him in 10B. The 9/11 Commission suggested that Suqami may have stabbed and killed Lewin after he attempted to stop the hijacking. Lewin {{is believed to be the}} first fatality in the 9/11 attacks. During a four-minute call to the American Airlines operations center, Ong provided information about lack <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> the cockpit, lack of access to the cockpit, and passenger injuries. She provided the seat locations of the hijackers, which later helped investigators to determine their identities.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of Shiller in the 2007 {{election}} largely {{focused on}} the lack <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> ward residents, failure to obtain input from residents for zoning changes in the ward, her lack of involvement in community policing meetings, and the many years of blighted retail in the ward. Some critics charged that Shiller was frustrating developers while using the Wilson Yard project to maintain her political base. In 2007, Shiller defeated social worker James Cappleman with 53% of the vote. In October, 2007, Shiller became chair of the City Council's Human Relations Committee. In 2009, Shiller was criticized by Uptown residents for her perceived lack of engagement in address crime in the neighborhood, including a string of violent robberies in nearby Lakeview that {{attracted the attention of}} the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, and local TV news. Police interviewed said interventions from Shiller and her staff facilitated the protection of gang members from policing activity, allegedly for gaining voter base, {{according to a report in}} Chicago Magazine.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Świerczewski halted his force's {{advance on}} Dresden, and ordered it {{to pull back}} and secure the breach. On 22 April he ordered the 1st Armored Corps to change direction, retreat from Dresden and support the centre. The 8th Infantry Division was also recalled; however, the 9th {{remained}} near Dresden. For a while Świerczewski was out <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> his superiors, including Marshal Konev. Konev also sent his chief of staff, General Ivan Yefimovich Petrov, and his chief of operations, General Vladimir Ivanovich Kostylev, {{to look at the}} situation. Petrov managed to re-establish communications, and left Kostylev in charge. Świerczewski was briefly relieved of his command for incompetence. To stabilize the situation, Konev ordered eight divisions from the Ukrainian Front to reinforce the Polish positions. Soviet 14th and Soviet 95th guards rifle divisions, as well as the Soviet 4th Guards Tank Corps, were ordered to attack toward Kamenz, Königswartha and Sdier to stop the Germans from advancing further north. The 2nd Air Army was also assigned to this theater.|$|E

5|$|His {{lieutenant}} at Basra, the Hashimi Abd al-Rahman ibn Abbas, tried but {{was unable}} to hold the city, as the populace opened the gates in exchange for a pardon after a few days. Abd al-Rahman too withdrew with as many Basrans as would follow him to Kufa, where Ibn al-Ash'ath's forces swelled further with the arrival of large numbers of anti-Umayyad volunteers. After taking control of Basra—and executing some 11,000 of its people, despite his pledge of pardon—al-Hajjaj marched on Kufa in April 701. His army was harassed by Ibn al-Ash'ath's cavalry, but reached the environs of the city and set up camp at Dayr Qurra, on the right bank of the Euphrates so as to secure his lines <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> Syria. In response Ibn al-Ash'ath left Kufa and with an army reportedly 200,000 strong approached al-Hajjaj's army and set up camp at Dayr al-Jamajim. Both armies fortified their camps by digging trenches and, as before, engaged in skirmishes. Whatever the true numbers of Ibn al-Ash'ath's force, al-Hajjaj was in a difficult position: his army was considerably outnumbered by the rebels, although reinforcements from Syria were constantly arriving, and his position was difficult to resupply with provisions.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Beta reached Providencia Island, on October 29, 2005. Rainfall {{from the}} storm were {{estimated}} over 12in (304mm). Roofs were damaged all over the island, and the island's main communications tower was knocked over. A total of 1,660 homes were damaged by the storm throughout the island, leaving 1.4millionColombian peso (2005COP; $681USD) in repair costs. This disrupted fixed-line telephone service and as the island has no cellular telephone service, it caused a total cessation <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> the mainland. Beta's arrival on the island {{was accompanied by a}} seven-foot storm surge, which damaged beaches, coastal houses and roads, and washed out a tourist footbridge. Coral reefs around the island were, for the most part, untouched, as only 1percent of the coral sustained minor damage. Minor effects were also found around areas of sea grass. Beaches all around the island lost an average of 9.8ft (3m) of sand due to erosion. Thirty people were injured and 913 families, a total of 3,074 people, were affected during Hurricane Beta's passage over the island.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring {{strove to}} organise and protect supply convoys {{in order to}} get the German-Italian Panzer Army the {{resources}} it needed. He succeeded in establishing local air superiority and neutralising Malta, which provided a base from which British aircraft and submarines could interdict Axis convoys headed for North Africa. Without the vital supplies they carried, particularly fuel, the Axis forces in North Africa could not conduct operations. Through various expedients, Kesselring managed to deliver an increased flow of supplies to Generaloberst Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps in Libya. With his forces thus strengthened, Rommel prepared an attack on the British positions around Gazala, while Kesselring planned Operation Herkules, an airborne and seaborne attack on Malta with the 185 Airborne Division Folgore and Ramcke Parachute Brigade. Kesselring hoped to thereby secure the Axis line <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> North Africa.|$|E

5|$|The {{second and}} third waves of castle {{building}} were led by the major magnates, {{and then by the}} more junior knights on their new estates. The apportionment of the conquered lands by the king influenced where these castles were built. In a few key locations the king gave his followers compact groups of estates including the six rapes of Sussex and the three earldoms of Chester, Shrewsbury and Hereford; intended to protect the line <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> <b>with</b> Normandy and the Welsh border respectively. In these areas a baron's castles were clustered relatively tightly together, but in most of England the nobles' estates, and therefore their castles, were more widely dispersed. As the Normans pushed on into South Wales they advanced up the valleys building castles as they went and often using the larger castles of the neighbouring earldoms as a base.|$|E
