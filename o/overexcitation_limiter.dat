40|$|This two-part paper {{deals with}} the early {{detection}} of an impending voltage instability from the system states provided by synchronized phasor measurements. Recognizing that voltage instability detection requires assessing a multidimensional system, the method fits a set of algebraic equations to the sampled states, and performs an efficient sensitivity {{in order to identify}} when a combination of load powers has passed through a maximum. This second part of the paper presents simulation results obtained from detailed time-domain simulation of the Nordic 32 test system, without and with measurement noise, respectively. Several practical improvements are described such as anticipation of <b>overexcitation</b> <b>limiter</b> activation, and use of a moving average filter. Robustness to load behaviour, non updated topology and unobservability is also shown. Finally a comparison with Thevenin impedance matching criterion is provided. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Sometimes, {{power system}} events {{have shown the}} need for {{generators}} {{to operate in the}} overexcited region to support stable operation. Operation up to, and transiently beyond, the overexcited limits from the capability curve is sometimes required. The two main issues in the paper are the generator capability in this region and the design of OEL (<b>OverExcitation</b> <b>Limiters)</b> in the excitation system that take full advantage of the capability allowed in the design and standard...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that a crucial factor {{determining}} the transmission capacity with regards to the voltage stability limit of a stressed power system, is the limitation of field and stator current of overexcited generators. These limiters are commonly referred to as <b>overexcitation</b> <b>limiters</b> (OEL) and stator current limiters (SCL). This thesis investigates the representation of <b>overexcitation</b> <b>limiters</b> and stator current limiters in the Swedish power system and how they could be implemented in the power system simulator PSS/E. Dynamic simulations in PSS/E are performed to investigate and validate differences between model types and parameters. The thesis compares different types of limiters and presents a representative set of parameters based on the documentation and implements them into PSS/E. The result from the study is a recommendation to migrate to limiter model MAXEX 2 for generators without stator current limiters. The MAXEX 2 model uses an inverse time characteristic which is becoming more common in installed voltage regulators. This feature makes it possible for extended use of generators before limiter action is applied. The MAXEX 2 model is also possible to tune into a fixed time delay to represent older types of limiters...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the dynamic {{performance}} of a power system with generators operating under rotor current limitation considering various models of takeover and summed-type <b>overexcitation</b> <b>limiters</b> (OELs). It is shown that in certain cases the field current limitation introduces slow generator dynamics that interact with long-term dynamic devices, such as LTCs, whereas in other cases the generator dynamics remain fast even after the limitation of rotor current. Equations suitable for a quasi steady state (qss) simulation corresponding to several OEL dynamic models are derived {{and the results are}} compared to those obtained by a full simulation...|$|R
40|$|This paper summarises {{experience}} {{and analysis of}} un-derfrequency load shedding and power generator is-landing. Most power systems can withstand {{the loss of a}} single generating unit or a single transmission line. Simultaneous loss of several power system components may cause a severe deficit in active and reactive power. The action of <b>overexcitation</b> <b>limiters</b> on the reiiiaining generators may further aggravate the situation. Such in-frequent events may cause severe drop in system fre-quency and voltage magnitude. Frequency relays for load shedding and power generator islanding must ope-rate correctly even if the system frequency decays and the voltage magnitude decays rapidly at the same time...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{long-term}} voltage instability {{triggered by the}} outage of transmission or generation equipments. It is shown how the onset of voltage instability could be detected in real-time from post-disturbance bus voltages provided by Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), assuming observability of the whole region prone to voltage instability. An extended set of equilibrium equations is fitted to the measurements and the change in sign of sensitivities is onitored. The latter are easily computed even for a large system. The important effects of <b>overexcitation</b> <b>limiters</b> and load tap changers are taken into account. The approach is illustrated on a 52 -bus 20 -machine system, where PMU outputs are simulated from detailed time simulation. Peer reviewe...|$|R
