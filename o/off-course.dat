40|$|Most of {{the risk}} models for ship-grounding {{accidents}} do not fully utilize available evidence, since {{it is based on}} accident statistics and expert opinions. The major issue with such kinds of models is their limitation in supporting the process of risk-management with respect to grounding accidents, since they do not reflect the reality to the extent required. This paper presents an evidence-based and expert-supported approach to structure a model assessing the probability of ship-grounding accidents, to make it more suitable for risk-management purposes. The approach focuses on using evidential data of ship-grounding accidents extracted from the actual accident and incident reports as well as the judgement elicited from the experts regarding the links and probabilities not supported by the reports. The developed probabilistic model gathers, in a causal fashion, the evidential contributing factors in ship-grounding accidents. The outcome of the model is the probability of a ship-grounding accident given the prior and posterior probabilities of the contributing factors. Moreover, the uncertainties associated with the elements of the model are clearly communicated to the end-user adopting a concept of strength-of-knowledge. The model can be used to suggest proper risk-control-measures to mitigate the risk. By running uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of the model, the areas that need more research for making educated decisions are defined. The model suggests the high-level critical parameters that need proper control measures are complexity of waterways, traffic situations encountered, and <b>off-coursed</b> ships.

40|$|Most of {{the risk}} models for ship-grounding {{accidents}} do not fully utilize available evidence, since in general they are merely based on accident statistics and expert opinions. The major issue with models of such kind is their limitation in supporting the process of risk management with respect to grounding accidents; {{because they do not}} necessarily reflect the reality to the extent required.  This thesis proposes an evidence-based framework for building evidence-based risk models for probabilistic assessment of ship grounding. In order to build the evidence required for creating the evidence-based risk model, traffic characteristics as primary source of data are extracted from AIS data and accident statistics of the Gulf of Finland. Additionally, using expert knowledge of the local pilots in the Gulf of Finland, a location dependent and semi-quantitative index as Waterway Complexity Index is defined to assess the dependency of ship grounding and navigational difficulty of a waterway to handle a ship. Moreover, ship grounding incident and accident reports from Finnish, Swedish, and British maritime authorities are utilized as primary and secondary sources of data respectively to build the required evidence for constructing the risk model. In this regard, two frameworks are introduced in this thesis to review and extract the embedded information from the reports. A new version of Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) is introduced as a framework to review the grounding accident reports; and a new positive taxonomy as Safety Factors, which are based on high level positive functions that are prerequisite for safe transport operations, is introduced to review the grounding incident reports.  Utilizing the proposed framework for evidence-based risk modeling as well as the built evidence from primary and secondary sources of data and expert knowledge, a Bayesian Network risk model is developed in this thesis for assessing the probability of ship grounding accidents. The uncertainties associated with the elements of the model are clearly communicated to the end user adopting a concept of strength of knowledge, and by introducing knowledge strength map for the built model. Therefore, it is argued in this thesis that the developed model is more suitable for risk management purposes, and the model can be used to suggest proper risk-control-measures to mitigate the risk of ship grounding accident. The developed model in this thesis suggests the high-level critical parameters that need proper control measures are complexity of waterways, traffic situations encountered, and <b>off-coursed</b> ships.

5|$|As {{the ships}} were {{traveling}} to the beach, the heavy seas, combined with {{the chaos of the}} fighting caused most of the landing force to be thrown <b>off-course</b> and most of the 116th Infantry missed its landing spots. Most of the regiment's tank support, launched from too far off-shore, foundered and sank in the channel. The soldiers of the 116th Infantry were the first to hit the beach at 0630, coming under heavy fire from German fortifications. Company A of the 1st Battalion, 116th Infantry, from the Virginia National Guard in Bedford, Virginia was annihilated by overwhelming fire as it landed on the 116th's westernmost section of the beach, along with half of Company C of the 2nd Ranger Battalion which was landing {{to the west of the}} 116th. The catastrophic losses suffered by this small Virginia community led to it being selected for the site of the National D-Day Memorial. The 1st Infantry Division's forces ran into similar fortifications on the eastern half of the beach, suffering massive casualties coming ashore. By 0830, the landings were called off for lack of space on the beach, as the Americans on Omaha Beach were unable to overcome German fortifications guarding the beach exits. Lieutenant General Omar Nelson Bradley, commanding the American First Army, considered evacuating the survivors and landing the rest of the divisions elsewhere. However, by noon, elements of the American forces had been able to organize and advance off the beach, and the landings resumed. By nightfall, the division headquarters landed on the beach with about 60 percent of the division's total strength, and began organizing the push inland. On 7 June, a second wave of 20,000 reinforcements from both the 1st and 29th Divisions was sent ashore. By the end of D-Day, 2,400 men from the two divisions had become casualties on Omaha Beach. Added to casualties at other beaches and air-drops made the total casualties for the Normandy landings 6,500 Americans and 3,000 British and Canadians, lighter numbers than expected.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{the cost}} of {{implementing}} such a system, SBSP also introduces several technological hurdles, including the problem of transmitting energy from orbit to Earth's surface for use. Since wires extending from Earth's surface to an orbiting satellite are neither practical nor feasible with current technology, SBSP designs generally {{include the use of}} some manner of wireless power transmission and its concomitant conversion inefficiencies, as well as land use concerns for the necessary antenna stations to receive the energy at Earth's surface. The collecting satellite would convert solar energy into electrical energy on board, powering a microwave transmitter or laser emitter, and transmit this energy to a collector (or microwave rectenna) on Earth's surface. Contrary to appearances of SBSP in popular novels and video games, most designs propose beam energy densities that are not harmful if human beings were to be inadvertently exposed, such as if a transmitting satellite's beam were to wander <b>off-course.</b> But the vast size of the receiving antennas that would be necessary would still require large blocks of land near the end users to be procured and dedicated to this purpose. The service life of space-based collectors in the face of challenges from long-term exposure to the space environment, including degradation from radiation and micrometeoroid damage could also become a concern for SBSP.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, between December 1942 and January 1943, {{a limited}} {{production}} run of nine Il-2s armed with Sh-37 guns was delivered to the 688th Attack Air Regiment (ShAP) of the 228th Attack Air Division (16th Air Army) for military trials. These aircraft {{took part in the}} combat around Stalingrad that winter. The Sh-37 gun proved somewhat effective against the German tanks of the day. It could pierce the armor of light tanks without problem and at favorable angles it was effective against German medium tanks as well. However, effective use of the gun required a high degree of skill from the pilots. Besides the diving issue, poor firing synchronization between the guns (as installed in these aircraft) caused them to also veer laterally <b>off-course</b> when the Sh-37 guns were fired. Consequently, bursts of only two or three rounds were practical. To compound the problems, the Sh-37 guns were also rather unreliable, with frequent jamming occurring. Even though the Sh-37s were installed in pairs, this actually decreased the overall reliability of the aircraft as a weapon system, because the jamming of a single gun meant that the Il-2 could not fire safely any longer, due to the strong, asymmetric recoil from a single gun having a very strong destabilizing effect on the aircraft. After these experiences, the Il-2 with Sh-37 guns was not ordered in mass production.|$|E
