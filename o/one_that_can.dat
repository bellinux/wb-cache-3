Homer tells Mr. Burns that it is Maggie's now, and {{she is the only}} <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> return it. Mr. Burns decides to talk to Maggie and becomes deeply depressed and asks Maggie to look after his bear. Maggie, in an act of pity, lets the desperate Mr. Burns have the bear.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently, David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) turns {{himself in}} at the FBI headquarters. Suffering from effects of being teleported out of his German prison cell by Walter's technology, he insists on only {{speaking}} to Olivia, warning {{that she is the}} only <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> stop a bomb from going off in 36 hours. Sanford Harris (Michael Gaston) instead orders Olivia to join other agents in raiding a warehouse which they believe Jones and his men used. Evidence confirms Jones had been there, but an agent dies from suffocation after finding another two-dollar bill.|$|E

5|$|Linezolid's {{spectrum}} of activity against Gram-positive bacteria {{is similar to that}} of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin, which has long been the standard for treatment of MRSA infections, and the two drugs are often compared. Other comparable antibiotics include teicoplanin (trade name Targocid, a glycopeptide like vancomycin), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid, a combination of two streptogramins, not active against E. faecalis), and daptomycin (Cubicin, a lipopeptide), and some agents still being developed, such as ceftobiprole, dalbavancin, and telavancin. Linezolid is the only <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be taken by mouth. In the future, oritavancin and iclaprim may be useful oral alternatives to linezolidâ€”both are in the early stages of clinical development.|$|E

5|$|The PlayStation 3 {{version of}} Flow {{features}} enhanced visuals and three additional playable organisms: <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> move {{with a short}} burst of speed, <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> paralyze other creatures, and one that lunges toward its prey's weak point. The worm creature from the original game was given {{the ability to move}} faster, while the jellyfish may now create a vortex to attract small creatures. These special moves are activated by hitting any button on the controller. When the player reaches the bottom plane with each creature, the next creature type is unlocked and becomes selectable {{at the beginning of the}} game. The PlayStation 3 version features a multiplayer mode for up to four players; a game in progress can be joined at any time, players may play different creatures if they desire so. The PlayStation Portable version contains all of the features introduced by PlayStation 3 version, but reduces the size of each plane. On November 20, 2007, the PlayStation 3 version received an add-on pack that allows players joining a multiplayer game to select their creatures. The pack also includes new enemies, food types, and a playable creature with a shield ability.|$|E
5|$|In {{computational}} complexity theory, 2-satisfiability {{provides an}} example of an NL-complete problem, <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be solved non-deterministically using a logarithmic amount of storage and that is among the hardest of the problems solvable in this resource bound. The set of all solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance can be given the structure of a median graph, but counting these solutions is #P-complete and therefore not expected to have a polynomial-time solution. Random instances undergo a sharp phase transition from solvable to unsolvable instances as the ratio of constraints to variables increases past 1, a phenomenon conjectured but unproven for more complicated forms of the satisfiability problem. A computationally difficult variation of 2-satisfiability, finding a truth assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied constraints, has an approximation algorithm whose optimality depends on the unique games conjecture, and another difficult variation, finding a satisfying assignment minimizing the number of true variables, is an important test case for parameterized complexity.|$|E

25|$|Medically, fatigue is a {{non-specific}} symptom, {{which means}} that it has many possible causes and accompanies many different conditions. Fatigue is considered a symptom, rather than a sign {{because it is a}} subjective feeling reported by the patient, rather than an objective <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be observed by others. Fatigue and 'feelings of fatigue' are often confused.|$|E

The specific type of tinnitus called pulsatile tinnitus is characterized by hearing the sounds of one's own pulse or muscle contractions, which is typically a result of sounds that have been created by the movement of muscles near to one's ear, or the sounds are related to blood flow of the neck or face.|$|E

The Galaxy has many similarities to its smaller Lockheed C-141 Starlifter predecessor, and the later Boeing C-17 Globemaster III. The C-5 is among the largest military aircraft in the world.|$|E
25|$|An amphibolic pathway is <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> {{be either}} catabolic or {{anabolic}} {{based on the}} availability of or the need for energy. The currency of energy in a biological cell is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which stores its energy in the phosphoanhydride bonds. The energy is utilized to conduct biosynthesis, facilitate movement, and regulate active transport inside of the cell. Examples of amphibolic pathways are the citric acid cycle and the glyoxylate cycle. These sets of chemical reactions contain both energy producing and utilizing pathways. To the right is an illustration of the amphibolic properties of the TCA cycle.|$|E
