30|$|An {{estimate}} of {{the contribution of the}} remaining parts of a mobile <b>operator’s</b> <b>organisation</b> to energy and carbon footprint can, for example, be based on corporate social responsibility reports by Vodafone and O 2, which state that the network accounts for around 80 % to 90 % of an operator’s energy consumption [29, 30] and constitutes a similar portion of its GHG emissions [31]. The GSMA Mobile Green Manifesto report [32] makes similar assumptions. We assume that these ratios also apply to the OCI network and networks of other operators in Cote d’Ivoire.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a mixed economy of social care has raised {{the profile of the}} UK voluntary sector. But although they constitute {{an important part of the}} voluntary sector, there is little information about small, local, voluntary service providers. It was suggested that external pressures such as changes in funding (from grant to contract) and social policies (enhancing the role of voluntary agencies in service provision) might result in significant changes to these organisations. Day centres and luncheon clubs for elderly people were chosen for study because these were services with a strong voluntary sector tradition; the services were community- based; and the population served was of particular concern to policy makers. Twelve agencies were examined: three day centres and three luncheon clubs in each of two London boroughs. Five variables were examined: goals, structure, governance, funding, and personnel. The study found that the main trigger for change was the increased frailty of clientele. This was <b>reported</b> by eight <b>organisations.</b> Six agencies <b>reported</b> increased extent and intensity of service, accompanied by hiring of paid staff and a re-examination of goals. Four <b>organisations</b> <b>reported</b> no changes in clientele, activities, personnel, or goals. Two <b>organisations</b> <b>reported</b> changes in clientele but no changes in the activities, personnel, or goals of the clubs. None of the <b>organisations</b> <b>reported</b> significant changes in governance. The study concluded that organisations that saw the service recipients as internal elements of the organisation were more likely to change than organisations that saw their clientele as external to the organisation. Paradoxically, the more the agencies responded to the needs of their members, the more formal and "bureaucratic" they had to become in order to provide an intensive, reliable service. The study challenges the assumption that external forces, particularly funding, invariably result in organisational change...|$|R
