5|$|Instead <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> on {{individual}} organisms, paleoecology examines {{the interactions between}} different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and the two-way interaction between organisms and their environment.  One example {{is the development of}} oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Together, these were a prerequisite for the evolution of the most complex eukaryotic cells, from which all multicellular organisms are built.|$|E

50|$|The same {{factors that}} {{determine}} {{depth of field}} also determine depth <b>of</b> <b>focus,</b> but these factors can have different effects {{than they have in}} depth of field. Both depth of field and depth <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> increase with smaller apertures. For distant subjects (beyond macro range), depth <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> is relatively insensitive to focal length and subject distance, for a fixed f-number. In the macro region, depth <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> increases with longer focal length or closer subject distance, while depth of field decreases.|$|R
25|$|The focus spread {{is related}} to the depth <b>of</b> <b>focus.</b> Ray (2000, 56) gives two {{definitions}} of the latter. The first is the tolerance of the position of the image plane for which an object remains acceptably sharp; the second is that the limits <b>of</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> are the image-side conjugates of the near and far limits of DOF. With the first definition, focus spread and depth <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> are usually close in value though conceptually different. With the second definition, focus spread and depth <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> are the same.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated the success of using a cubic phase mask in optical systems to perform wavefront coding which, along with digital post-processing can extend the depth <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> standard optical imaging systems [1, 2]. Experimental images have demonstrated an increase of six to eight times the depth <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> standard systems when using the extended depth <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> technology. This technology is now being extended to high magnification or light microscope systems. Several challenges have arisen due to the special nature of light microscope systems but extended depth <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> (EDF) technology is still found to be useful in such systems. Due to the high numerical apertures and magnification of most light microscope systems, the depth <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the systems are generally small. Increases in magnification and numerical aperture will decrease the depth <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the microscope as will {{a decrease in the}} wavelength of the illumination used [3]. When imaging thin sections of specimen for details, a small depth of field is acceptable, but when details of a thicker object are sought, the low depth <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> is unacceptable. Even confocal microscopes suffer from limited depth <b>of</b> <b>focus.</b> The process for extending depth <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> in standard imaging systems can therefore be beneficial to microscope imaging systems. Placing a cubic phase mask in the aperture stop of the microscope will have the effect of optically encoding information about the specimen. Once the information about the object has been encoded and passed through the optical system, a CCD camera can then capture the coded information, and pass it along to a chip or into software where the information is recovered through digital post-processing. The cubic phase mask has a phase delay function with respect to spatial coordinates according to: P (x; y) = exp(j(x 3 +...|$|R
5|$|The war {{of words}} would {{continue}} for another 130 years with endless commentary from doctors, poets, playwrights and authors all arguing for their favorite region and their polemics being reproduced in advertisements for Burgundy and Champagne. On a few occasions, the two regions were {{on the brink of}} civil war. A turning point occurred when several Champagne wine makers abandoned efforts to produce red wine in favor <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> on harnessing the effervescent nature of sparkling Champagne. As the bubbles became more popular, doctors throughout France and Europe commented on the health benefits of the sparkling bubbles which were said to cure malaria. As more Champenois winemakers embarked on this new and completely different wine style, the rivalry with Burgundy mellowed and eventually waned.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Australian {{government}} {{announced that the}} national service scheme would be implemented once again, however, instead <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> upon expanding the CMF, the scheme was set up so that national servicemen would serve limited terms of service in Australian Regular Army (ARA) units {{with a view to}} service overseas in Vietnam and Malaysia. This highlighted the changing focus of Australia's military planning towards Regular forces, however, it had a negative impact upon the division as essentially it was forced to compete with the ARA for manpower and although some gains were made from men that chose to serve longer national service terms in the CMF in order to defer their service in ARA units, these were negligible and arguably of limited quality. The government's decision not to deploy CMF units to these conflicts meant that many of the division's experienced personnel chose to transfer to ARA units in order to gain operational experience, although some attempts were made to rectify this situation by offering CMF officers the opportunity to undertake a short attachment to an ARA unit serving in Vietnam and a number of 3rd Division officers took up this opportunity, a few even saw combat.|$|E
5|$|Children {{under five}} years old display the least {{effective}} strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions). Declines in self-regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies.|$|E

5|$|Gerard {{also had}} an uneasy {{relationship}} with his cathedral chapter, after attempting to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them {{to give up their}} wives and concubines and become ordained priests. He wrote to Anselm in 1103 complaining of the intransigence of his clergy and envying Anselm's better relations with Canterbury's chapter, which was composed of monks instead of the secular canons who made up York Minster's chapter. In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy. He also accused them of accepting prebends but refusing to live or work at the cathedral, and <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> on a narrow legal definition of celibacy without actually being celibate. The canons' argument was that they were only required not to maintain women in their own houses, but they were not forbidden to visit or entertain women in houses belonging to others. It was not only Gerard who complained about the relationship between him and his canons; the latter accused Gerard of impoverishing York by making gifts of lands to others.|$|E
5|$|The lens {{features}} a hypersonic zoom motor for its autofocus, {{which is considered}} to be a fast and quiet design. In addition, manual override is allowed in the single-shot autofocus mode. The lens, which focuses internally, has one of the lowest maximum magnification measurements in its class (which includes the Canon 10â€“18mm and 10â€“22mm, Sigma 10â€“20mm f/3.5 and Sigma 10â€“20mm f/4â€“5.6 EX DC HSM, Tamron 10â€“24mm f/3.5â€“4.5 DI II, Nikon 10â€“24mm f/3.5â€“4.5G ED AF-S DX, and Tokina 11â€“16mm f/2.8 AT-X Pro DX lenses). The lens' autofocus feature is not functional with Pentax ist* series and K100D DSLR cameras that do not support hypersonic zoom mechanics. The lens is capable <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> from infinity to minimum focusing distance and back in under a second: so micro focusing is rapid. However, because of the narrow focus range (0.13x) the lens is not suitable for macro photography.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhibition}} {{opened on}} July 9, 1962, with Warhol absent. The thirty-two single soup can canvases {{were placed in}} a single line, much like products on shelves, each displayed on narrow individual ledges. The contemporary impact was uneventful, but the historical impact is considered today {{to have been a}} watershed. The gallery audience was unsure what to make of the exhibit. A John Coplans Artforum article, which was in part spurred on by the responding display of dozens of soup cans by a nearby gallery with a display advertising them at three for 60 cents, encouraged people to take a stand on Warhol. Few actually saw the paintings at the Los Angeles exhibit or at Warhol's studio, but word spread in the form of controversy and scandal due to the work's seeming attempt to replicate the appearance of manufactured objects. Extended debate on the merits and ethics <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> one's efforts on such a mundane commercial inanimate model kept Warhol's work in art world conversations. The pundits could not believe an artist would reduce the art form to the equivalent of a trip to the local grocery store. Talk did not translate into monetary success for Warhol. Dennis Hopper was the first of only a half dozen to pay $100 for a canvas. Blum decided to try to keep the thirty-two canvases as an intact set and bought back the few sales. This pleased Warhol who had conceived of them as a set, and he agreed to sell the set for ten monthly $100 installments to Blum. Warhol had passed the milestone of his first serious art show. While this exhibition was on view in Los Angeles, Martha Jackson canceled another planned December 1962 New York exhibition.|$|E
