5|$|Ironically, Bawdsey {{was ignored}} by the Germans for the entire war, while St Athan was {{attacked}} by a Junkers Ju 88 <b>only</b> <b>weeks</b> after the team arrived. The single bomb struck the runway directly, but failed to explode.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, 2007, <b>only</b> <b>weeks</b> {{after the}} Rockets were {{eliminated}} from the playoffs, Jeff Van Gundy was dismissed as head coach. Three days later, the Rockets signed former Sacramento Kings coach Rick Adelman, who was thought {{to focus more on}} offense than the defensive-minded Van Gundy.|$|E
5|$|A gull colony {{has been}} present since 1984, {{although}} gulls were seen briefly {{on the shores}} of the new island <b>only</b> <b>weeks</b> after it first appeared. The gull colony has been particularly important in developing the plant life on Surtsey, and the gulls have had much more of an impact on plant colonisation than other breeding species due to their abundance. An expedition in 2004 found the first evidence of nesting Atlantic puffins, which are extremely common {{in the rest of the}} archipelago.|$|E
50|$|Draw the Line {{entered and}} peaked on the UK Album Chart at number 5 and charted for <b>only</b> 5 <b>weeks,</b> making it Gray's poorest {{performing}} release since The EPs 1992-1994 which charted for <b>only</b> 1 <b>week.</b> In Austria, it entered and peaked at number 74, charting for <b>only</b> 1 <b>week.</b>|$|R

5|$|All {{five men}} injured {{that night at}} the Seward home survived. Powell was {{captured}} the next day at the boarding house of Mary Surratt, and was executed on July 7, 1865, along with Herold, Atzerodt, and Mrs. Surratt, convicted as conspirators in the Lincoln assassination. Their deaths occurred <b>only</b> <b>weeks</b> after that of Seward's wife Frances, who never recovered from the shock of the assassination attempt.|$|E
5|$|Krasin helped {{manufacture}} bombs {{to use in}} {{the attack}} on the stagecoach. Kamo's gang smuggled bombs into Tiflis by hiding them inside a sofa. <b>Only</b> <b>weeks</b> before the robbery, Kamo accidentally detonated one of Krasin's bombs while trying to set the fuse. The blast severely injured him in the eye, leaving a permanent scar. Kamo was confined to his bed for a month owing to intense pain, and had not fully recovered {{by the time of the}} robbery.|$|E
5|$|<b>Only</b> <b>weeks</b> after {{gaining the}} kingship, Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson was slain by a knight named Ívarr and his accomplices. The kingship was then seized by Haraldr Guðrøðarson, Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's first cousin once removed, {{suggesting}} that the killers and the new king had colluded together. The assassination, therefore, {{appears to have been}} a continuation of the vicious family feud that had engulfed the Crovan dynasty since the late twelfth century, when Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's father and Haraldr Guðrøðarson's grandfather first contested the kingship of the Isles.|$|E

5|$|Sledd and {{his wife}} Annie also {{suffered}} a personal tragedy during his time as a Candler professor, when their first-born son and his namesake, Andrew Sledd Jr., died after an extended illness in 1919.

5|$|Two years later, Linden was {{selected}} {{as a member of}} Team Canada in the 1998 Nagano Olympics. Though he injured his knee <b>only</b> <b>weeks</b> before, he played in all six games, scoring one goal, a game-tying marker with 67 seconds left against the Czech Republic that sent the semi-final game to overtime. Canada finished fourth in the tournament. Later that summer, he participated in the 1998 World Championships. He scored one goal and four assists as Canada finished fifth.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} President Grant ran for reelection in 1872, Grant's {{administration}} had been rocked by scandal, and some disaffected {{members of his}} party formed the Liberal Republicans, naming Greeley as their candidate for president, a nomination soon joined in by the Democrats. Hay was unenthusiastic about the editor-turned-candidate, and in his editorials mostly took aim at Grant, who, despite the scandals, remained untarred, and who won a landslide victory in the election. Greeley died <b>only</b> <b>weeks</b> later, a broken man. Hay's stance endangered his hitherto sterling credentials in the Republican Party.|$|E

5|$|In 1237, Óláfr {{died and}} was succeeded by his elder son, Haraldr, who later drowned in 1248. The kingship was then {{taken up by}} his brother, Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson. After a reign of <b>only</b> <b>weeks,</b> Rǫgnvaldr was slain and the kingship was taken up by Haraldr Guðrøðarson, a {{descendant}} of Óláfr's half-brother and deadly rival, Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles. After a short reign, this Haraldr was removed from power by his overlord, Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway. In Haraldr's absence, Magnús and a relation of his, Eóghan Mac Dubhghaill, King in the Isles, unsuccessfully attempted to conquer Mann. A few years later, Magnús successfully made {{his return to the}} island and was proclaimed king.|$|E
5|$|In 1782, Prince Alfred was inoculated against smallpox. The {{sickness}} {{proved too}} much for the child and in June he was taken to Deal with his governess Lady Charlotte Finch to recover. It was hoped that the sea air, bathing in the water, and horseback riding would improve his condition. While he was there, Alfred endeared himself to many, including an old woman whom he waved to. In spite of his charming disposition, he continued to break out in spots and his chest was troubling him. When he returned to Windsor in August 1782, the doctors inspected him and realized that the boy had <b>only</b> <b>weeks</b> to live. After suffering bouts of fever and continuing problems with his chest, Prince Alfred died on 20 August 1782, at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, not even two years old.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, 2002, {{dozens of}} {{members from the}} Deputy Sheriff's Association issued a vote of no {{confidence}} in the incumbent sheriff during {{a meeting at the}} county's courthouse. The vote, they claimed, was issued due to allegations that the sheriff made against members of the agency, in which he said they were deliberately malingering in order to reflect badly on him. The sheriff rejected the allegations as unfounded and voiced his displeasure over the vote, calling them politically motivated due to their proximity to the primary elections, which was <b>only</b> <b>weeks</b> away at the time.|$|E

5|$|Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's reign was an {{extremely}} short one; <b>only</b> <b>weeks</b> after his accession, he was slain on Mann. His killer is identified by a contemporary source as a knight named Ívarr {{who may have been}} an ally of Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's second cousin once removed, Haraldr Guðrøðarson (fl. 1249), who seized the kingship immediately following the killing. Although at first Haraldr was recognised as a legitimate ruler of the kingdom by Henry III, King of England (died 1272), Haraldr was later regarded as a usurper by his Norwegian overlord, Hákon. In 1250, Hákon summoned Haraldr to Norway to answer for his seizure of the kingship, and Haraldr was kept from returning to the Isles.|$|E
5|$|The {{refusal to}} grant {{affiliation}} caused a bitter row to ensue that showed little sign of being resolved. Despite {{not having the}} support of the governing body, the new league continued their plans regardless. No affiliation would have meant that the clubs would have problems attaining work permits for their signings and finding officials to referee their matches. The row also threatened the future of the Nottingham Panthers, as the National Ice Centre were reluctant to allow a team from an unaffiliated league hire their arena. The issue was resolved in August 2003 when the Panthers and the NIC announced an icetime agreement. The EIHL finally agreed affiliation in August 2003, with <b>only</b> <b>weeks</b> to go before the beginning of the new season.|$|E
5|$|Beardsley {{featured}} {{regularly for}} Kettering {{at the start}} of 2008–09, and scored his first goal of the season after turning in Jean-Paul Marna's cross in the 82nd-minute of a 2–0 away win over Cambridge on 25 August 2008. Having scored four goals in the first two months of 2008–09, he rejoined former club Kidderminster on a one-month loan on 27 November 2008, with a view to a permanent transfer. He debuted as an 80th-minute substitute in a 3–2 home victory against Salisbury City on 6 December 2008. Beardsley made three appearances while on loan at Kidderminster, and returned to Kettering after being recalled in January 2009. <b>Only</b> <b>weeks</b> after returning, he entered Kettering's 4–2 home loss to Premier League team Fulham in the FA Cup on 24 January 2009 as a 73rd-minute substitute. Beardsley featured mostly as a substitute over the remainder of 2008–09, which he finished with 44 appearances and 5 goals for Kettering. They finished in eighth-place in the Conference Premier, and Beardsley was released by the club in May 2009.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, a Saving Private Ryan {{special edition}} DVD was {{released}} {{to commemorate the}} 60th anniversary of D-Day. This two-disc edition was also included in a box set titled World War II Collection, along with two documentaries produced by Spielberg, Price For Peace (about the Pacific War) and Shooting War (about war photographers, narrated by Tom Hanks). The film was released on Blu-ray Disc on April 26, 2010 in the UK and on May 4, 2010 in the US, as part of Paramount Home Video's premium Sapphire Series. However, <b>only</b> <b>weeks</b> after its release, Paramount issued a recall due to audio synchronization problems. The studio issued an official statement acknowledging the problem, which they attributed to an authoring error by Technicolor that escaped the quality control process, {{and that they had}} already begun the process of replacing the defective discs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Only</b> <b>weeks</b> {{after the}} Darlington affair, the South Carolina Supreme Court {{declared}} the act creating the dispensary system {{in violation of}} the state constitution {{on the grounds that the}} government had no right to run a profit-making business. The vote was 2–1, with Justice Samuel McGowan in the majority. McGowan was a lame duck in office; Lieutenant Governor Gary had been elected to fill his seat effective August 1, 1894. Tillman closed the dispensaries temporarily, resulting in prohibition in South Carolina, and fired the constables. He had taken the precaution, once the court agreed to take the dispensary case, of having the 1893 legislature pass a revised dispensary law. When Gary took the bench, the Tillmanites would have a majority on the state Supreme Court, and Tillman instructed trial justices not to hear challenges to the 1893 law until after August 1. Tillman kept the law suspended until then, afterwards reopening the dispensaries under that statute. The high court declared the 1893 act constitutional on October 8, 1894, 2–1, with Gary voting in the majority.|$|E
5|$|Wendell and Edith Willkie {{moved to}} New York in October 1929, <b>only</b> <b>weeks</b> before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, {{and found an}} {{apartment}} overlooking Central Park. Initially intimidated by the size and anonymity of the big city, Wendell Willkie soon learned to love it. He attended the Broadway theatre, and read through ten newspapers each day. Willkie {{and his wife had}} little in common, and grew apart through the 1930s. He acquired a social life, and met Irita Van Doren, the book review editor of the New York Herald Tribune who became a friend, and later his lover. Cultured, brilliant and well connected, Van Doren introduced him to new books, new ideas, and new circles of friends. Unlike Van Doren, Willkie was indiscreet about their relationship, and their affair was well known to the reporters covering him during his 1940 presidential campaign. None of them printed a word.|$|E
