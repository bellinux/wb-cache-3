5|$|Despite a low-scoring {{start to}} the 2003 English cricket season, in which he passed 40 only <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first seven innings of the season, he kept {{his place in the}} Test side for the visit of the touring Zimbabweans. Batting at number five in both Tests, Key failed to make much of an impact, scoring 18 runs in the first match and four in the second. He had reason to feel aggrieved at his first Test dismissalumpire Steve Bucknor gave him out caught behind, despite Key not hitting the ball.|$|E

5|$|In the 2012 offseason, {{with the}} Predators {{unable to take}} Weber to {{arbitration}} again (a player can only be subjected to team-elected arbitration <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career), Weber signed a front-loaded $110 million, 14-year offer sheet, $68 million {{of it as a}} signing bonus, from the Philadelphia Flyers on July 19. The offer sheet was the richest in NHL history in terms of total money, money per season and length, surpassing the previous offer sheet record set by Thomas Vanek. The Predators, already having lost Weber's defensive partner Ryan Suter to unrestricted free agency, matched the offer sheet five days later. Following the 2012-13 NHL lockout, the CBA was changed to prevent teams from signing other players to similar deals.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{were led}} offensively by the triple threat of quarterback Drew Willy, running back James Starks, and wide {{receiver}} Namaan Roosevelt. The three combined to break 14single-season school records, including most points scored in a season (404). Willy, heading into his final game as a Buffalo Bull, had already surpassed the 3,000-yard mark in passing on the season, throwing for 25touchdowns against only fiveinterceptions. Starks, while not seen as the same caliber of player as UConn's Donald Brown, had run for over 1,300yards and caught 41passes for 340yards, scoring 16touchdowns on the year. Roosevelt {{was seen as the}} top playmaker, going over the 100-yard mark in each of Buffalo's last fivegames and scoring at least <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> last seven.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{season in}} 1963–64, O'Neill started poorly, passing 12 only <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first six innings. However, he was retained {{for the team}} for the First Test against South Africa in Brisbane, where he scored 82 and 19 not out in a drawn match. He continued his resurgence with 36 and 61 not out the following fixture against Victoria, but was injured during the second innings and forced to retire hurt. This meant that he missed the Second Test, which Australia won by eight wickets. O'Neill returned and scored half centuries {{in each of the}} next two Tests. He also took two wickets to end the series with 285 runs at 40.71 and three wickets at 32.33. He added a further two half-centuries in the remaining Shield matches.|$|E

5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1934 Lombardi's roommate Jim Lawlor {{introduced}} him to his cousin's relative, Marie Planitz. When Marie announced her ardent desire to marry Lombardi, her status-conscious stockbroker father didn't {{like the idea of}} his daughter marrying the son of an Italian butcher from Brooklyn, a prejudice he would face more than <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life. Lombardi and Marie wed, nonetheless, on August 31, 1940.|$|E

25|$|Bateman {{initially}} {{published his}} review in 1948. He was a botanist, {{contributing to the}} literature of sexual selection only <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lifetime. Bateman initially saw his study on Drosophila to be a test of Charles Darwin’s doctrine of sexual selection. He saw Darwin’s theory of natural selection not as flawed, but as incomplete. He felt {{that if he were}} to provide a concrete demonstration of how sexual selection {{played a role in the}} reproductive success of certain species, he could explain the gap between Darwin’s ideas and sexual dimorphism.|$|E
