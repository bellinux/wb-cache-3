40|$|Abstract: With the {{introduction}} of jumbo trailing suction hopper dredgers {{and the development of}} deep sea dredging equipment came <b>suction</b> <b>pipe</b> constructions and gantries of ever increasing dimensions. The implementation of submerged dredge pumps and the application of longer and greater number of pipe sections of large diameter resulted in <b>suction</b> <b>pipe</b> constructions which distinguish themselves from traditional constructions by their bigger mass and deviating mass distribution. Given the fact that these characteristics have changed significantly and are features that determine the dynamic motion behaviour of a <b>suction</b> <b>pipe</b> construction, one enters a new field concerning the dynamic behaviour of these constructions. This paper describes a mathematical model, developed at IHC Holland’s R&D institute MTI Holland in co-operation with Delft University of Technology. With this mathematical model one can perform calculations in the frequency domain to determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an arbitrary <b>suction</b> <b>pipe</b> construction during the hoisting or lowering operation above the water line. These eigenvalues and eigenvectors determine the dynamic motion behaviour of the <b>suction</b> <b>pipe</b> construction.

40|$|Hydraulic turbine <b>suction</b> <b>pipes</b> at {{hydropower}} plants (HPPs) play {{an important}} role for providing high power indices of HPP operation. At the same time for channel type HPPs with vertical reactive hydraulic turbines curved large size suction tubes are used and this leads to great costs for their installation. That is why the significance of economic analysis for justification of the size of such <b>suction</b> <b>pipes</b> is underlined. Minimally possible sizes of curved pipes (height and length) are determined by hydraulic turbine normal operation requirements and are given in reference books. Nevertheless often such conditions arise when the correction of their size leading to their enlargement becomes inevitable. In particular, when there are rocks at a small depth below of the project position of the foundation slab it is feasible to increase a <b>suction</b> <b>pipe’s</b> height to place the foundation concrete on the strong rock. Or if it is necessary to make a motorway at the downstream side of a channel HPP lengthening of a <b>suction</b> <b>pipe</b> appears sensible. In such cases economic calculations are necessary on feasibility of <b>suction</b> <b>pipe</b> size change proposals. The use of an integral effect technique for such an analysis is proposed.

40|$|International audienceIn a {{pump sump}} it is {{imperative}} that the amount of non-homogenous flow and entrained air be kept to a minimum. Free air-core vortex occurring at a water-intake pipe is an important problem encountered in hydraulic engineering. These vortices reduce pump performances, may have large effects on the operating conditions and lead to increase plant operating costs. This work is an extended study starting from 2006 in LML and published by ISSA and al. in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Several cases of sump configuration have been numerically investigated using two specific commercial codes and based on the initial geometry proposed by Constantinescu and Patel. Fluent and Star CCM+ codes are used in the previous studies. The results, obtained with a structured mesh, were strongly dependant on main geometrical sump configuration such as the <b>suction</b> <b>pipe</b> position, the submergence of the <b>suction</b> <b>pipe</b> on one hand and the turbulence model on the other hand. Part of the results showed a good agreement with experimental investigations already published. Experiments, conducted in order to select best positions of the <b>suction</b> <b>pipe</b> of a water-intake sump, gave qualitative results concerning flow disturbances in the pump-intake related to sump geometries and position of the pump intake. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to reproduce the flow pattern of experiments and to confirm the geometrical parameter that influences the flow structure in such a pump. The numerical model solves the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and VOF multiphase model. STAR CCM+ with an adapted mesh configuration using hexahedral mesh with prism layer near walls was used. Attempts have been made to calculate two phase unsteady flow for stronger mass flow rates and stronger submergence with low water level in order to be able to capture air entrainment. The results allow the knowledge of some limits of numerical models, of mass flow rates and of submergences for air entrainment. In the validation of this numerical model, emphasis was placed on the prediction of the number, location, size and strength of the various types of vortices coming from the free surface. Contours of vorticity at free surface, air cores, isoline of pressure surface were particularly examined for some cases.

40|$|Turbidity is {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the major}} environmental problems of dredging. To get a handle on this problem the Dutch dredging industry (VBKO) commissioned a research project to develop software capable of predicting how much sediment is released into suspension during dredging operations. Major field measurement exercises are carried out in order to provide calibration data for the software. One exercise has been carried out using a trailing suction hopper dredger (Cornelia) working in the port of Rotterdam in June 2002. During dredging by a trailing suction hopper dredger one or two <b>suction</b> <b>pipes</b> are lowered on the seabed. A mixture of sediment and water is sucked up and passes into the hopper of the dredger. When the hopper is loaded beyond capacity, excess mixture leaves the hopper by means of the overflow and is released back into the water. This overflow of sediment is the main contribution to the sediment plumes near the dredging vessel. The main objective of this thesis is to find out whether the flow rate and the solids concentrations leaving the dredging vessel can be calculated sufficiently from the measured overflow samples. Special techniques were developed to sample the hopper overflow. Three novel flowthrough samplers are constructed to sample the overflow mixture. These have been used, in combination with a bottle sampler to obtain about 500 samples taken at four different locations in the overflow during 14 trips. All samples have been analysed on particle size distribution and dry matter content, some samples also on particle specific gravity. Soil samples taken in the dredging area provide the data needed for mapping the soil conditions coming up by the <b>suction</b> <b>pipes.</b> It appears that at some locations quite homogeneous soil conditions are present. Nevertheless also significant variations in the Particle Size Distributions have been found. During all dredging operations, the vessel's TDS (Tonnes Dry Solids) system has logged the characteristics like draughts and the concentrations plus velocities of the upcoming mixture in the <b>suction</b> <b>pipes.</b> These data have been reviewed to assess their reliability. After recalibration of the datasets, the concentration leaving the vessel by the overflow is computed by using sediment balances. The computed sediment releases have been compared with the measured overflow releases in order the attempt to validate the sampling method. It appeared that validation of the samples by this comparison was not possible. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
