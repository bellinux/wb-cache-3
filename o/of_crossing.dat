5|$|Before 1952, {{the inner}} German border could be crossed {{at almost any}} point along its length. The {{fortification}} of the border resulted in the severing of 32railway lines, three autobahns, 31main roads, eight primary roads, about 60 secondary roads and thousands of lanes and cart tracks. The number <b>of</b> <b>crossing</b> points was reduced to three air corridors, three road corridors, two railway lines and two river connections giving transit access to Berlin, plus a handful of additional crossing points for freight traffic.|$|E
5|$|Bristol Bridge, {{the only}} way <b>of</b> <b>crossing</b> the river without using a ferry, was rebuilt between 1764 and 1768.

A toll was charged to pay for the works, and when, in 1793, the toll was extended for a further period of time the Bristol Bridge Riot ensued.

5|$|The direct {{precursor}} of dopamine, L-DOPA, can be synthesized indirectly from the {{essential amino acid}} phenylalanine or directly from the non-essential amino acid tyrosine.

Along with the Rialto Bridge, {{is one of the}} very few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose. It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and William Pulteney, the owners of the Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath.|$|E
5|$|As at Northampton, Chapman's tactics {{were based}} upon the {{principles}} of a strong defence and a fast, counter-attacking response, with the focus on quick, short passing and mazy runs from his wingers, who would pass low inside the defence instead <b>of</b> <b>crossing</b> from the byline. He had been granted control of all footballing affairs at the club and made this responsibility work to his advantage, encouraging the club's reserve and third teams to play the same style of football so that their players would function effectively in the first team if selected. He employed a wide-ranging scouting network {{to find the right}} players for his tactical system. Bolstered by the money from the cup run, Chapman was able to make further signings such as goalkeeper Ted Taylor and forward Charlie Wilson (later to be joined by George Cook).|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the French {{government}} {{tried to}} impose a system <b>of</b> <b>crossing</b> Poitevin horses with lighter-weight Norman and Thoroughbred horses to create cavalry horses. Despite financial incentives, private breeders protested because they felt that the resulting crossbred horses created poor quality mules upon further breeding. The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed for work in its marshy homeland, including large hooves and a calm manner. Some sources argue that at this point the breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses. Others state that they were not pulling horses, and were instead used almost solely for the production of mules.|$|E

5|$|Banksia robur and B.oblongifolia hybrids {{have been}} {{recorded}} at several locations along the eastern coastline. Field workers for The Banksia Atlas recorded 20 populations between Wollongong and Pialba in central Queensland. Locales include Calga north of Sydney, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, and Cordeaux Dam near Wollongong. A study of an area of extensive hybridization between the two near Darkes Forest on the Woronora Plateau south of Sydney revealed extensive hybridisation in mixed species stands but almost none in pure stands of either species there. Genetic analysis showed generations <b>of</b> <b>crossing</b> and complex ancestry. Morphology generally correlated with genetic profile, but occasionally plants that resembled one parent had some degree of genetic hybridisation. Furthermore, {{there were a few}} plants with morphology suggestive of a third species, B.paludosa, in their parentage, and requiring further investigation. A possible hybrid between B.oblongifolia and B.integrifolia was recorded near Caloundra by Banksia Atlas volunteers.|$|E

Walter finds a blue, paralytic substance at the scene, which he suspects is from mutated DNA. The investigation leads to a local resident, Andre Hughes (John Savage), who tells them he lost his wife and baby in childbirth.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine how crosses are {{utilised}} in the English Premier League. Specifically, the position that the crosses are delivered from, the delivery style, the position within the 18 -yard box that the ball is delivered to and the defensive overload within the 18 -yard box. A total of 30 English Premier League matches were observed; whereby 551 crosses were analysed. When the ball was crossed from zone A, 12. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>crosses</b> resulted in a goal and when the ball was crossed from zone B, 11. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>crosses</b> resulted in a goal. A significant association was found between cross location and number of goals scored (ᵡ² = 22. 895, p= 0. 006). When low crosses were used, 30. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>crosses</b> resulted in a goal attempt and when in-swinging crosses were used, 24. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>crosses</b> resulted in a goal attempt. A significant association was found between delivery style and number of goal attempts (ᵡ² = 12. 461, p= 0. 006). When the ball was delivered into zone 3, 25. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>crosses</b> were scored and when the ball was delivered into zone 6, 11. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>crosses</b> were scored. A significant association was found between delivery location and number of goals attempts (ᵡ² = 49. 117, p= 0. 000). When no defensive overload was present, 45. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>crosses</b> resulted in a goal attempt and when a minimal defensive overload was present, 23. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>crosses</b> resulted in a goal attempt. A significant association was found between defensive overload and number of goal attempts (ᵡ² = 14. 696, p= 0. 001). Results from this study suggest that cross location, delivery style, delivery location and the defensive overload are all contribute towards the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>crosses.</b> Further investigation into how the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>crosses</b> can be enhanced is recommended and suggestions for future research have been proposed...|$|R
