40|$|Combining rabies-virus tracing, <b>optical</b> {{clearing}} (<b>CLARITY),</b> and whole-brain light-sheet imaging, we mapped the monosynaptic inputs to midbrain dopamine neurons projecting {{to different}} targets (different {{parts of the}} striatum, cortex, amygdala, etc.) in mice. We found that most populations of dopamine neurons receive a similar set of inputs rather than forming strong reciprocal connections with their target areas. A common feature among most populations of dopamine neurons was the existence of dense 'clusters' of inputs within the ventral striatum. However, we found that dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum were outliers, receiving relatively few inputs from the ventral striatum and instead receiving more inputs from the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and zona incerta. These results lay a foundation for understanding the input/output structure of the midbrain dopamine circuit and demonstrate that dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum constitute a unique class of dopamine neurons regulated by different inputs...|$|R

40|$|The Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) {{mission is}} based on the {{scientific}} heritage of the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), a proof-of-concept instrument carried on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) NIMBUS- 7 environmental satellite for the purpose of measuring upwelling radiance from the ocean surface. The CZCS mission provided the first observations of ocean color from space, and over the mission lifetime of 1978 - 1986, allowed oceanographers an initial opportunity to observe the variable patterns of global biological productivity. One of the key elements of the CZCS mission was the formation of the CZCS NIMBUS Experiment Team (NET), a group of optical physicists and biological oceanographers. The CZCS NET was designated to validate the accuracy of the CZCS radiometric measurements and to connect the instrument's measurements to standard measures of oceanic biological productivity and <b>optical</b> seawater <b>clarity.</b> In the period following the cessation of CZCS observations, some of the insight and experience gained by the CZCS NET activity has dissipated as several proposed follow-on sensors failed to achieve active status. The Sea WiFS mission will be the first dedicated orbital successor to CZCS it in turn precedes observations by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of the Earth Observing System (EOS). Since the CZCS NET experience is an important model for Sea WiFS and MODIS surface truth efforts, this document is intended to provide a comprehensive review of the validation of oceanographic data for the first orbital ocean color sensor mission. This document also summarizes the history of the CZCS NET activities. The references listed in the Bibliography are a listing of published scientific research which relied upon the CZCS BET algorithms, or research which was conducted on the basis of CZCS mission elements...|$|R
5000|$|Originally, Kino Precision {{manufactured}} {{some of the}} now-famous Series 1 manual focus lenses {{under contract}} for Vivitar, a U.S. lens distributor of after-market film lenses for 35mm cameras. However, after the positive reception from consumers on Vivitar Series 1 lenses, and as Vivitar was using other Japanese lens manufacturers to produce Vivitar brand lenses, the company believed {{the time was right}} to successfully market lenses to fit existing 35mm Japanese film cameras under their own brand, Kiron. Kiron soon became {{known as one of the}} very few after-market lens manufacturers that could supply products equal to or even exceeding the optical and mechanical quality of the original manufacturer. In particular, the Kiron 28mm/2.0, the 105mm/2.8 1:1 macro, the 28-210mm/4.0-5.6 and the 3.8-5.6 varifocal zoom, and the 28-85mm/2.8-3.8 varifocal macro zoom lenses were praised in contemporary reviews of the day for their superb <b>optical</b> resolution and <b>clarity,</b> as well as mechanical quality. Although reasonably priced for the level of quality offered, Kiron manual focus lenses were never economy-level products, and were always made and assembled in Japan. [...] As such, Kiron lenses produced during the 1980s were normally priced only slightly below lenses offered by the camera manufacturers themselves. Later, Vivitar itself would purchase some Kiron/Kino lens designs, (such as the Kiron 105mm f/2.8 macro lens, re-labeled as the Vivitar 100mm f/2.8 macro and the Vivitar 105mm/2.5 (1:1) macro lenses), and offered them for sale under the Vivitar brand. They begin with the serial number 22XXXXXX.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to ballistic performance, the U.S. military standard includes requirements for <b>optical</b> <b>clarity,</b> protection from UV rays, fit, chemical resistance, and environmental stability (properties won’t {{be changed by}} exposure {{to a range of}} temperatures or levels of humidity).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to lenses, anti-scratch coatings {{are often used}} on plastic products wherever <b>optical</b> <b>clarity,</b> weathering and chemical resistance are required. These include optical discs, displays, injection-molded parts, gauges and other instruments, mirrors, signs, eye safety/protective goggles, and cosmetic packaging. These coatings are usually water-based or solvent-based.|$|E
50|$|Polyphenyl ethers (PPEs) possess good <b>optical</b> <b>clarity,</b> a high {{refractive}} index, {{and other}} beneficial optical properties. Because of these, PPEs {{have the ability}} to meet the rigorous performance demands of signal processing in advanced photonics systems. <b>Optical</b> <b>clarity</b> of PPEs resembles that of the other optical polymers, that is, they have refractive indices of between 1.5 and 1.7 and provide good propagation of light between approximately 400 nm and 1700 nm. Close refractive index (RI) matching between materials is important for proper propagation of light through them. Because of the ease of RI matching, PPEs are used in many optical devices as optical fluids. Extreme resistance to ionizing radiation gives PPEs an added advantage in the manufacture of solar cells and solid-state UV/blue emitters and telecommunication equipment made from high-index glasses and semiconductors.|$|E

5000|$|Strontium iodide (SrI2) is a salt of {{strontium}} and iodine. It is an ionic, water-soluble, and deliquescent {{compound that}} can be used in medicine as a substitute for potassium iodide [...]It is also used as a scintillation gamma radiation detector, typically doped with europium, due to its <b>optical</b> <b>clarity,</b> relatively high density, high effective atomic number (Z=48), and high scintillation light yield.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{polyimide}} {{parts are}} {{not affected by}} commonly used solvents and oils — including hydrocarbons, esters, ethers, alcohols and freons.

5000|$|Purely {{decorative}} bell jars were {{commonly used}} in the Victorian period to display and serve as transparent dust covers for clocks and taxidermy. Decorative bell jars were made of thin glass, with more care being taken regarding their <b>optical</b> <b>clarity,</b> {{and they did not}} have a thickened base flange. For this reason, they are not suitable for vacuum use and would usually fail if pumped down.|$|E
5000|$|... "Wet" [...] {{specimen}} {{collections are}} stored in different solutions. A very old method is to store the specimen in 70% ethanol with various additives after fixing with formalin or in these days sometimes with a salt-solution. Some methods are very useful, because the color can be preserved. (Salt-)Solutions like this are Jores, Kaiserling and Romhányi. Modern specimens {{are stored in}} borosilicate glass due to its chemical and thermal resistance and good <b>optical</b> <b>clarity.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{resin-based}} {{lens material}} {{was created by}} Kaenon. SR-91 was certified by Colts Laboratories and received a score of 40 lines of resolution, the highest score offered by the facility for <b>optical</b> <b>clarity</b> and acuity (20 is a passing score; anything beyond 40 is undetectable to the human eye). SR-91 was the first non-polycarbonate material to pass the high-mass impact ANSI Z.87.1 testing {{and was the first}} to combine this passing score with the highest marks for clarity.|$|E
50|$|Above its glass {{transition}} temperature and below its melting point, the physical properties of a thermoplastic change drastically without an associated phase change. Some thermoplastics do not fully crystallize below the {{glass transition}} temperature, retaining {{some or all of}} their amorphous characteristics. Amorphous and semi-amorphous plastics are used when high <b>optical</b> <b>clarity</b> is necessary, as light is scattered strongly by crystallites larger than its wavelength. Amorphous and semi-amorphous plastics are less resistant to chemical attack and environmental stress cracking because they lack a crystalline structure.|$|E
50|$|The warm, {{stagnant}} {{air present}} within the twinwall cells can present problems. Algae and bacterial growth can be incubated inside these cells, {{resulting in a}} decrease in <b>optical</b> <b>clarity,</b> reducing {{the efficiency of the}} greenhouse. Cleaning these growths can be difficult because of the inability to use many solvents with polymer-based glazing. Solvents disrupt the intermolecular forces present in thermoplastics, irreparably destroying many of their physical properties in the process, including their ductility and translucence. Polymers, especially polycarbonate, that are treated with solvents such as acetone will develop a cloudy appearance, greatly reducing light transmission.|$|E
50|$|Virtually {{all modern}} {{laboratory}} glassware {{is made of}} borosilicate glass. It is widely used in this application due to its chemical and thermal resistance and good <b>optical</b> <b>clarity,</b> but the glass can react with sodium hydride upon heating to produce sodium borohydride, a common laboratory reducing agent. Fused quartz {{is also found in}} some laboratory equipment when its higher melting point and transmission of UV are required (e.g. for tube furnace liners and UV cuvettes), but the cost and difficulty of working with quartz make it excessive for the majority of laboratory equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Early work on opto-mechanical methods {{was done}} by Martin Wright. [...] Opto-mechanical {{spectacles}} allow focus control by the wearer via movement of a small slider located {{on top of the}} bridge. The user adjusts the lens for <b>optical</b> <b>clarity</b> at the desired distance. [...] They are a combination of rigid and flexible lenses that can change prescription to enable sharp focus at different distances (from infinity up to 13"). The appropriate addition range depends on the user’s level of refractive error. A tiny mechanism, actuated by the slider, simultaneously controls both flexible lenses to assure appropriate near vision tracking in both eyes.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in 2002, by 3M, {{this system}} uses sensors {{to detect the}} {{piezoelectricity}} in the glass that occurs due to a touch. Complex algorithms then interpret this information and provide the actual location of the touch. The technology claims to be unaffected by dust and other outside elements, including scratches. Since {{there is no need}} for additional elements on screen, it also claims to provide excellent <b>optical</b> <b>clarity.</b> Also, since mechanical vibrations are used to detect a touch event, any object can be used to generate these events, including fingers and stylus. A downside is that after the initial touch the system cannot detect a motionless finger.|$|E
50|$|Extant {{sirenians}} grow {{to between}} 2.5 and 4 m {{in length and}} can weigh up to 1,500 kg. Steller's sea cow was the largest sirenian to have lived, and could reach lengths of 9 m, and could weigh in at 8 to 10 MT. A dugong's brain weighs a maximum of 300 g, about 0.1% of the animal's body weight. The body of sirenians is sparsely covered in short hair (vibrissae), except for on the muzzle, which may allow for tactile interpretation of their environment. Manatees are the only creatures to exhibit corneal avascularity, and lack {{blood vessels in the}} cornea, which prevents <b>optical</b> <b>clarity</b> and vision. This {{may be the result of}} irritations from or protection against their hypotonic freshwater environment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{addition}} of surfactants {{does not always}} {{have a positive effect}} on all properties. The water resistance of the coating can be decreased with surfactant addition since surfactants can be very water-soluble and will easily wash out of a coating. This problem of moisture resistance is particularly prevalent problem for art conservation, as well as problems with adhesion, loss of <b>optical</b> <b>clarity,</b> and dirt pickup caused by polyether surfactants in contemporary acrylic emulsion used in artworks bearing acrylic coats. [...] While the type and amount of surfactant determine what properties will be affected, other chemicals in a paint can alter the overall effect the surfactants may have on the paint. Elasticity has been found to either increase or decrease in latex paints depending on the amount of TiO2 present.|$|E
50|$|An {{infrared}} touchscreen uses {{an array}} of X-Y infrared LED and photodetector pairs {{around the edges of}} the screen to detect a disruption in the pattern of LED beams. These LED beams cross each other in vertical and horizontal patterns. This helps the sensors pick up the exact location of the touch. A major benefit of such a system is that it can detect essentially any input including a finger, gloved finger, stylus or pen. It is generally used in outdoor applications and point of sale systems which can not rely on a conductor (such as a bare finger) to activate the touchscreen. Unlike capacitive touchscreens, infrared touchscreens do not require any patterning on the glass which increases durability and <b>optical</b> <b>clarity</b> of the overall system. Infrared touchscreens are sensitive to dirt/dust that can interfere with the IR beams, and suffer from parallax in curved surfaces and accidental press when the user hovers his/her finger over the screen while searching for the item to be selected.|$|E
50|$|Sunglass lenses {{are made}} of either glass, plastic, or SR-91. Plastic lenses are {{typically}} made from acrylic, polycarbonate, CR-39 or polyurethane. Glass lenses have the best <b>optical</b> <b>clarity</b> and scratch resistance, but are heavier than plastic lenses. They can also shatter or break on impact. Plastic lenses are lighter and shatter-resistant, but {{are more prone to}} scratching. Polycarbonate plastic lenses are the lightest, and are also almost shatterproof, making them good for impact protection. CR-39 is the most common plastic lens, due to low weight, high scratch resistance, and low transparency for ultraviolet and infrared radiation. SR-91 is a proprietary material that was introduced by Kaenon Polarized in 2001. Kaenon's lens formulation was the first non-polycarbonate material to pass the high-mass impact ANSI Z.87.1 testing. Additionally, it was the first to combine this passing score with the highest marks for lens clarity. Jerry Garcia's sunglasses had a polykrypton-C type of lens which was 'cutting edge' in 1995.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "reef ready" [...] {{or simply}} [...] "drilled" [...] tank is often used. This style of tank has holes drilled {{into the rear}} pane {{allowing}} water to drain into the sump or refugium. These drains are usually housed in an internal overflow apparatus made of plastic or glass which encloses a drain standpipe and a water return line (See fig 1, a). The surface water pours over the overflow, down the standpipe (See fig 1, b), through PVC piping, into the sump. After transiting the sump, water is pushed by a return water pump through the second hole and into the aquarium (See fig 1, c). Alternatively, standard non-drilled aquariums employ an external [...] "hang-on" [...] overflow that feeds water via continuous siphon to the sump (See fig 1 d). The tanks are usually constructed from either glass or acrylic. Acrylic {{has the advantage of}} <b>optical</b> <b>clarity,</b> lightness, and ease of drilling. Drawbacks include a tendency to scratch easily, bowing, and often limited access from above due to top bracing. Glass aquariums are heavier but harder to scratch. Other materials such as epoxy-coated plywood have been used by industrious DIYers, but these materials are typically reserved for the construction of larger tanks.|$|E
50|$|The {{key to this}} {{technology}} is that a touch at any one position on the surface generates a sound wave in the substrate which then produces a unique combined sound after being picked up by three or more tiny transducers attached {{to the edges of}} the touchscreen. The sound is then digitized by the controller and compared to a list of pre-recorded sounds for every position on the surface. The cursor position is instantly updated to the touch location. A moving touch is tracked by rapid repetition of this process. Extraneous and ambient sounds are ignored since they do not match any stored sound profile. The technology differs from other attempts to recognize the position of touch with transducers or microphones in using a simple table look-up method, rather than requiring powerful and expensive signal processing hardware to attempt to calculate the touch location without any references. As with the dispersive signal technology system, a motionless finger cannot be detected after the initial touch. However, for the same reason, the touch recognition is not disrupted by any resting objects. The technology was created by SoundTouch Ltd in the early 2000s, as described by the patent family EP1852772, and introduced to the market by Tyco International's Elo division in 2006 as Acoustic Pulse Recognition. The touchscreen used by Elo is made of ordinary glass, giving good durability and <b>optical</b> <b>clarity.</b> APR is usually able to function with scratches and dust on the screen with good accuracy. The technology is also well suited to displays that are physically larger.|$|E
