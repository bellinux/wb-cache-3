5|$|Fish such as Dascyllus aruanus have bold {{disruptive}} patterns <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>sides,</b> {{breaking up}} their outlines with strong contrasts. Fish like Heniochus macrolepidotus have similar bands of colour that extend into fins projecting {{far from the}} body, distracting attention from the true shape of the fish.|$|E
5|$|Eschrichtiids {{have one}} living member: the grey whale. They are bottom feeders, mainly eating {{crustaceans}} and benthic invertebrates. They feed by turning <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>sides</b> and taking in water mixed with sediment, {{which is then}} expelled through the baleen, leaving their prey trapped inside. This is an efficient method of hunting, in which the whale has no major competitors.|$|E
5|$|All {{bodies were}} in similar flexed {{positions}} lying on their left sides with knees raised up towards their chin. In comparison, most bodies excavated from Egypt {{dating to the}} predynastic period are in a similar position, however at Merimda Beni Salama and El-Amra bodies were found on their right sides. From the time these bodies were buried up until the Middle Kingdom period, the dead were laid <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>sides.</b> After this period they were buried on their backs (dorsal position), and from the Fifth Dynasty the bodies were always fully extended.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts {{remain to be}} {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working to close the gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>sides,</b> causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|Irish {{merchant}} shipping {{saw to it}} that vital imports continued to arrive and exports, mainly food supplies to Great Britain, were delivered. Irish ships sailed unarmed and usually alone, identifying themselves as neutrals with bright lights and by painting the Irish tricolour and EIRE in large letters <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>sides</b> and decks. Nonetheless twenty percent of seamen serving in Irish ships perished, victims of a war not their own: attacked by both sides, though predominantly by the Axis powers. Often, Allied convoys could not stop to pick up survivors, while Irish ships always answered SOS signals and stopped to rescue survivors, irrespective of which side they belonged to. Irish ships rescued 534 seamen.|$|E
5|$|The Schiavo case {{involved}} 14 appeals and numerous motions, petitions, and hearings in the Florida courts; five suits in federal district court; extensive political intervention at {{the levels of}} the Florida state legislature, Governor Jeb Bush, the U.S. Congress, and President George W. Bush; and four denials of certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States. The case also spurred highly visible activism from the pro-life movement, the right-to-die movement, and disability rights groups. Since Schiavo's death, both {{her husband and her}} family have written books <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>sides</b> of the case, and both have also been involved in activism over its larger issues.|$|E

5|$|The {{sandstone}} formations {{from which}} Silver Reef gets its name were formed when tectonic stresses forced long, longitudinally aligned sections of Navajo Sandstone to buckle and stand <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>sides,</b> {{giving them the}} appearance of ocean reefs. Over {{long periods of time}} silver ore, sediments, and vegetation were carried in water runoff from the Chinle Formation to the White, Buckeye, and East reefs. The ore settled as deposits and the vegetation became petrified. The Silver Reef Mining District's geologic resources consist mainly of silver deposits, with smaller deposits of copper, gold, lead, and uranium oxide. Iron oxide deposits in the soil rocks cause a red coloration, and dinosaur tracks from the early Jurassic period have been found in the area.|$|E
5|$|Their coat differs geographically, with elands {{in north}} Africa having {{distinctive}} markings (torso stripes, markings on legs, dark garters and a spinal crest) that are absent in the south. Apart from a rough mane, the coat is smooth. Females have a tan coat, while the coats of males are darker, with a bluish-grey tinge. Bulls {{may also have}} a series of vertical white stripes <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>sides</b> (mainly in parts of the Karoo in South Africa). As males age, their coat becomes more grey. Males also have dense fur on their foreheads and a large dewlap on their throats.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Germany, she resumed training duties in the Baltic. She was withdrawn from service in May 1938 {{for a major}} modernization. The funnels were modified with raked caps and searchlight platforms <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>sides.</b> The ship's 8.8cm guns were replaced with more powerful 10.5cm guns. Work lasted until November 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II. She spent {{the next several months}} on trials and training maneuvers. On 4 January, Karlsruhe and the minelayer Schiff 23 were sent to intercept the Swedish steamer Konung Oscar, which was transporting Polish refugees from Riga to Sweden. Karlsruhe caught the Swedish vessel, declared it a prize, and sent it and the 41 Poles aboard to Memel. She was not ready for combat operations by the start of Operation Weser√ºbung, so she was used as a troop transport for the attack on Kristiansand. The attack force also included an E-boat tender, four large torpedo boats, and several E-boats.|$|E

50|$|The upright seated {{position}} is advantageous {{in that there}} is less distortion of spinal anatomy which allows for easier withdrawal of fluid. Some practitioners prefer it for lumbar puncture in obese patients, where lying <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side</b> would cause a scoliosis and unreliable anatomical landmarks. However, opening pressures are notoriously unreliable when measured in the {{seated position}}. Therefore, patients will ideally lie <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side</b> if practitioners need to measure opening pressure.|$|R
5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>sides,</b> scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E
5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>sides</b> so that by pulling actors {{up and down on the}} rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on gimbals so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera at the bottom of a corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{generally}} whitish grubs, roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends. They have fifteen segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing. They have no legs but {{are able to}} move {{within the confines of}} the cell, helped by tubercles <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>sides.</b> They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing their food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce their cocoons. The pupa can be seen through the semi-transparent cocoon and over the course of a few days, the insect undergoes metamorphosis into the form of the adult bee. When ready to emerge, it splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the exuviae as a winged adult and breaks out of the cell.|$|E

5|$|The 12"/50 was a Bethlehem development. It {{was most}} likely based on the weapon used in the United States' , the 12"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun. The twelve guns were mounted in six twin turrets. Four turrets were superfiring fore and aft, while {{the other two were}} located en echelon in wing turrets. The latter weapons could, in theory, fire on a ¬∞ range on their {{respective}} sides of the hull and ¬∞ on the other, but in reality this was not possible, as the blast damage from the weapons would damage the ship. A more reasonable estimate would be ¬∞ <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>sides.</b> The 6-inch secondary armament was placed in casemates, with six {{on either side of the}} ship. For protection, they were provided with 6inches of armor. The 4-inch weaponry, intended for use against marauding destroyers, was mounted unarmored in various places around the ship, including the main deck, superstructure, and far up near the bow. As originally built, there were sixteen 4-inch guns, but four of those were replaced with four 3-inch AA guns and four 3-pounders during the 1924-1926 modernization. The torpedo tubes were located underneath the waterline and were loaded in a dedicated compartment.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} belonged to an aged individual. Its taphonomy is unusual {{as it was}} found lying on its back ‚Äì in contrast, most other nearly complete dinosaur skeletons of the Nemegt Formation usually are found lying <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>sides.</b> The specimen was found encased in cross-bedded sandstone deposited by a river. Most of the discovered vertebrae were still connected together, forming a continuous series that consisted of 8 dorsal, 6 sacral and 34 caudal vertebrae. An additional 3 vertebrae were found isolated from the series and may belong to the transitional area between back and neck. The remaining parts of the skeleton were shifted slightly out of their original anatomical position. Both the left limb and rib bones {{were found on the}} right side of the body, while conversely the right limb and rib bones were found on the left side. Bite marks have been identified on the skeleton, particularly in the pelvis and the thigh bone, showing that predators had fed on the carcass. The skull and neck are missing, indicating that the carnivores might have carried away these body parts. The completeness of the remains indicate that the individual had died near the discovery site. A flooding event might have transported the carcass a short distance and subsequently covered it with sediment, even before the soft tissue had decayed entirely.|$|E
