5|$|As a player, Chapman {{played for}} a variety <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> at Football League and non-League levels. His record was {{generally}} unremarkable as a player; he made fewer than 40League appearances {{over the course of}} a decade and did not win any major honours. Instead, he found success as a manager, first at Northampton Town between 1908 and 1912, whom he led to a Southern League title. This attracted the attention of larger clubs and he moved to Leeds City, where he started to improve the team's fortunes before the First World War intervened. After the war ended, City were implicated in an illegal payments scandal and were eventually disbanded. Chapman was initially banned from football but successfully appealed. He took over at Huddersfield Town, winning an FA Cup and two First Division titles in the period of four years.|$|E
5|$|As {{illustrated}} by the table of matches above, little is known of organised cricket to 1725 {{because of the lack}} of newspaper coverage. The shortage of references in the latter part of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. It follows that equally little is known <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> and teams, players and locations.|$|E

5|$|Controversy hit the Championship in the 1921–22 season {{which saw}} the major clubs (including Pro Vercelli, Bologna and Juventus) in {{dispute with the}} FIGC. The best 24 teams had asked for a {{reduction}} in the number <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> in the top division in accordance with a plan drawn up by Vittorio Pozzo, the Italian national team coach. Pozzo's plan was dismissed and the CCI (Italian: Confederazione Calcistica Italiana) was founded and organised a 1921–22 CCI league (Prima Divisione) to run concurrently with the 1921–22 season (Prima Categoria) organised by the FIGC. Therefore, that season saw two champions: Novese (FIGC) and Pro Vercelli (CCI). The schism ended when FIGC accepted to reduce the Northern Championship 1922–23 to only 36 clubs ("Compromesso Colombo/Colombo compromise"); from 1923–24 the Northern Championship was reduced to 24 clubs divided into two groups.|$|E
5|$|Due to insistence by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), the {{international}} governing body of football, that domestic leagues {{reduce the number}} of games clubs played, the number <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> was reduced to 20 in 1995 when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted.

5|$|Following the {{independence}} of Slovenia, the Football Association of Slovenia separated from the Football Association of Yugoslavia and created their own football competitions.

The format and the number <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> in the league has changed over time, ranging from 21 clubs in the first season to 10 clubs in its present form.

5|$|From 1921–22, {{the third}} tier of The Football League {{consisted}} of two parallel sections of 22 clubs, fighting both for promotion to the Second Division and also battling {{to hold on to}} their league status. There was a re-election system in place which meant the bottom two teams in each of the two divisions had to apply for re-election to the league. Watford finished outside the top six league positions in every season between 1922 and 1934. Following Kent's departure in 1926, they finished 21st out of 22 clubs in 1926–27, but were unanimously re-elected to the league after a ballot <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> in the top two divisions of The Football League. By contrast, under Neil McBain and subsequently Bill Findlay, the team recorded five consecutive top six finishes between 1934–35 and 1938–39, and won the Football League Third Division South Cup in 1937. The Football League was suspended in 1939 due to the Second World War.|$|E
