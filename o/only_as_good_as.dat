They had wanted her not for any good they could do her, but for the harm they could, with her unconscious aid, do each other. She should serve their anger and seal their revenge, for husband and wife had been alike crippled by the heavy hand of justice, which in the last resort met on neither side their indignant claim to get, as they called it, everything.

40|$|The {{revelation that}} Volkswagen had {{employed}} an illegal “defeat device” {{to comply with}} regulation, but fundamentally side-step some emission controls during realworld driving, has thrust the issue of regulatory non-compliance into the spotlight. A growing base of evidence has indicated {{that one of the}} underlying reasons for the observed emissions discrepancies, and subsequently the Volkswagen Scandal, is shortcomings in regulatory compliance protocols. This has raised questions about the efficacy of the United States and European Union regulatory frameworks for vehicle emissions, which both incorporated elements of performance based regulation, albeit with nuanced applications differing in terms of their enforcement and monitoring activities. Scholars have often argued that performance-based regulation can <b>only</b> be <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> a regulator’s ability to monitor outcomes, however, this research argues that that performance-based regulation can <b>only</b> be <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> a regulator’s ability to enforce outcomes.

Using a triangulation of evidence from government documents –including documents from the recently established European Parliament Committee on Emissions Measurements in the Automotive Sector-, non-government documents, and semi-structured interviews, this research uses a process tracing approach to explain that the different responses of the United States and the European Union to the Volkswagen Scandal can be explained {{as a result of their}} application of performance based regulation: specifically enforcement capabilities...|$|R
