5|$|Anslinger claimed {{cannabis}} caused {{people to}} commit violent crimes and act irrationally and <b>overly</b> sexual. The FBN produced propaganda films promoting Anslinger's views and Anslinger often commented {{to the press}} regarding his views on marijuana.|$|E
5|$|Highlights of the publication's {{first year}} have been {{published}} in book form as Halfwit Nation: Frontline Reporting from the War on Stupid, both to acclaim and to complaints of unintelligent, <b>overly</b> crude humour.|$|E
5|$|Tono and Tini {{are served}} by two men, Karno and Abdul. Karno, Tono's loyal manservant, dislikes Tini and {{considers}} her <b>overly</b> emotional. Abdul is their driver, who usually drives Tono to meet his patients.|$|E
50|$|The western central {{parts of}} the Surat basin unconformably <b>overlies</b> the Palaeozoic igneous, {{metamorphic}} and sedimentary rocks of the Lachlan Fold Belt. In the east and northern parts of Queensland it unconformably <b>overlies</b> the sedimentary basin rocks of the Hunter-Bowen Orogen. The Surat Basin <b>overlies</b> {{parts of the}} Bowen Basin in southern Queensland, and <b>overlies</b> the Gunnedah Basin in central New South Wales.|$|R
50|$|The Cashaqua shale {{underlies}} the Rhinestreet Shale {{member of the}} West Falls Group, and <b>overlies</b> various {{other members of the}} Sonyea Group. In the western part of New York State, it <b>overlies</b> the Middlesex Shale, and moving eastward, it <b>overlies</b> the Pulteney shale and then the Rock Stream Formation in west-central New York.|$|R
50|$|The Columbus {{conformably}} <b>overlies</b> the Lucas Dolomite {{in northeastern}} Ohio, and unconformably <b>overlies</b> other dolomite elsewhere. It unconformably underlies the Ohio Shale in northwestern Ohio and the Delaware Limestone in eastern Ohio.|$|R
5|$|Amongst other {{witnesses}} to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading {{him to believe}} that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, <b>overly</b> cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.|$|E
5|$|Between the two World Wars, Nevada {{served in}} both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets. Though she had {{originally}} been equipped with 21 five-inch (127mm)/51 cal guns to defend against enemy destroyers, this number was reduced to 12 in 1918, due to the <b>overly</b> wet bow and stern positions of the other nine.|$|E
5|$|Bodyline, {{also known}} as fast leg theory bowling, was a cricketing tactic devised by the English cricket team for their 1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia, {{specifically}} to combat the extraordinary batting skill of Australia's Don Bradman. England's use of a tactic perceived by some as <b>overly</b> aggressive or even unfair ultimately threatened diplomatic {{relations between the two}} countries before the situation was calmed.|$|E

50|$|Around Mount Job, rhyodacite {{contains}} hornblende, biotite and quartz. On {{the east}} side of the Affliction Glacier, rhyodacite of the Job Assemblage <b>overlies</b> porphyritic andesite of the older Pylon Assemblage. The more recently formed Capricorn Assemblage <b>overlies</b> the Job Assemblage at the head of Affiction Glacier and Capricorn Glacier.|$|R
5|$|By the 1890s {{food was}} still very limited in variety, with few vegetables. Porridge was given for breakfast, usually too fluid or <b>overly</b> solid, and the general {{standard}} of the prison's food was quite low, particularly in 1897 and 1898. However, the quality soon improved, as noted by the 1898 Royal Commission, which recommended decreasing rations to reduce costs.|$|E
5|$|In 1820 Harrison {{ran against}} Jennings in his re{{election}} bid. Jennings {{won the election}} by a large majority, 11,256 votes to Harrison's 2,008. Jennings's win by a three-to-one margin suggests he remained a popular politician and the state's voters were not <b>overly</b> concerned by attacks on the governor's character.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the ACLU became {{involved}} in a case involving the distribution of child pornography (New York v. Ferber). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the three prong obscenity test should be outlawed, but that the law in question was <b>overly</b> restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. The court did not adopt the ACLU's position.|$|E

5|$|Nan Chiau High School {{is known}} for its strict {{regulations}} and discipline, with minimal tolerance to misbehaviour of its students. In 2004 the school gained attention for its disciplinary action on a student over misconduct, which was deemed <b>overly</b> harsh. This came despite the backing of many alumni, educators and parents stressing that the action taken was justified.|$|E
5|$|Scottish nineteenth-century Reformed theologian William Cunningham {{also sought}} to {{articulate}} a distinctively Reformed theology of baptism in the modern world. Cunningham preferred the writings of Zwingli on the sacraments, writing that Calvin and later Reformed orthodox theologians <b>overly</b> elevated {{the value of the}} sacraments. He argued that the efficacy of baptism only applies to adults expressing faith in the act of baptism.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution Act of 1867 was {{designed}} to meet the growing calls of Canadians for autonomy from British rule, while avoiding the <b>overly</b> strong decentralization that contributed to the Civil War in the United States. The compromises made by the Fathers of Confederation set Canadians on a path to bilingualism, and this in turn contributed to an acceptance of diversity.|$|E

5|$|The New York Times {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq. On May 26, 2004, {{a year after}} the war started, the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as they should have been, and were insufficiently qualified, frequently <b>overly</b> dependent upon information from Iraqi exiles desiring regime change. Reporter Judith Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead-up to the Iraq War was factually inaccurate and <b>overly</b> favorable to the Bush administration's position, for which The New York Times later apologized. One of Miller's prime sources was Ahmed Chalabi, an Iraqi expatriate who returned to Iraq after the U.S. invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{problems}} {{encountered by}} these {{projects have been}} credited to factors including <b>overly</b> optimistic estimates of their value; declines throughout the global economy, particularly the U.S. crash in home prices; and decreased appeal of Woods following his 2009 infidelity scandal.|$|E
5|$|As the Game Boy Advance {{was able}} to handle newer, {{enhanced}} graphics, Ruby and Sapphire were the first games in the series that allowed up to four people to share information at one time, {{as opposed to the}} previous limit of two. However, the development team used a more basic graphics engine {{in order to keep the}} game simple and not <b>overly</b> confusing. The team wanted the games to appeal to a large audience, so the game was designed to be easy enough for younger generations of children to play, but new features were added to bring the veteran gamers back.|$|E
50|$|It {{underlies}} the Palm Spring Formation, and <b>overlies</b> the Ocotillo Formation.|$|R
50|$|The {{formations}} <b>overlies</b> {{the basement}} of metamorphic and igneous rocks, that is Bahía Mansa Metamorphic Complex and Cretaceous granitoids respectively. In parts it further <b>overlies</b> the coal-bearing Pupunahue-Catamutún Formation. The sedimentary facies of Santo Domingo Formation are composed of sandstone, siltstone and mudstone plus smaller amounts of conglomerate. The formation underlies Pliocene and Quaternary sediments.|$|R

5|$|As {{the world}} starts to globalize, it is {{accompanied}} by criticism of the current forms of globalization, which are feared to be <b>overly</b> corporate-led. As corporations become larger and multinational, their influence and interests go further accordingly. Being able to influence and own most media companies, {{it is hard to}} be able to publicly debate the notions and ideals that corporations pursue. Some choices that corporations take to make profits can affect people all over the world. Sometimes fatally.|$|E
5|$|Core Design's Fighting Force (1997) was {{anticipated}} {{to redefine the}} genre for 32-bit consoles through its use of a 3D environment. However, it was met with a lukewarm reception. The Dynasty Warriors series, beginning with Dynasty Warriors 2 in 2000, offered traditional beat 'em up action on large 3D battlefields, displaying dozens of characters on the screen at a time. The series to date spans 14 games (including expansions) which players in the West view as <b>overly</b> similar, although the games' creators claim their large audience in Japan appreciates the subtle differences between the titles. While critics saw Dynasty Warriors 2 as innovative and technically impressive, they held a mixed opinion of later titles. These later games received praise for simple, enjoyable gameplay but were simultaneously derided as <b>overly</b> simplistic and repetitive. Another best-selling Japanese series, Yakuza, combined elaborate plots and detailed interactive environments with street brawling action. Despite these releases, game reviewers started to pronounce that the genre had died off. By 2002, there were virtually no new beat 'em ups being released in arcades.|$|E
5|$|Despite his wealth, he was {{not known}} for a lavish life. His court of about a hundred people was not known for being <b>overly</b> extravagant, he built no luxurious residences, and did not even have a single {{portrait}} of himself made during his life. It is uncertain how Wiśniowiecki looked, although a number of portraits and other works depicting him exist. Jan Widacki notes {{that much of the}} historiography concerning Wiśniowiecki focuses on the military and political aspects of his life, and few of his critics discuss his successes in the economic development of his estates.|$|E
