Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E

5|$|An {{unidentified}} dark parrot seen {{alive by}} the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselqvist in Africa {{was given the}} name Psittacus obscurus by Linnaeus in 1758, who again synonymised it with the Mascarene parrot in 1766. Because of this association, some authors believed {{it was from the}} Mascarene Islands as well, but this dark parrot's description differs from that of the Mascarene parrot. This disagreement led some authors to use now-invalid combinations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> names, such as Mascarinus obscurus and Coracopsis obscura. The unidentified parrot may have been an African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) instead.|$|E
5|$|As Taeniura meyeni, {{the round}} ribbontail ray was {{described}} by German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle in their 1841 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, based on two syntypes collected from Mauritius. However, this species is better known under the name Taeniura melanospila (or melanospilos), which was applied by Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker to a juvenile specimen from Java, in a 1953 volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> journal Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indië.|$|E
5|$|As {{a naturalist}} {{he had a}} great curiosity, observing the geography, geology, plants, animals, birds, reptiles, {{amphibians}} and fish around him and recording what he saw and heard about. He wrote acclaimed books including British Zoology, the History of Quadrupeds, Arctic Zoology and Indian Zoology although he never travelled further afield than continental Europe. He knew and maintained correspondence with many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> figures of his day. His books influenced the writings of Samuel Johnson. As an antiquarian, he amassed a considerable collection of art and other works, largely selected for their scientific interest. Many of these works are now housed at the National Library of Wales.|$|E

5|$|Clark Thomas Rogerson, (2 October 1918– 7 September 2001), was an American mycologist. He {{was known}} for his work in the Hypocreales (Ascomycota), {{particularly}} Hypomyces, a genus of fungi that parasitize other fungi. After receiving his doctorate from Cornell University in 1950, he went on to join the faculty of Kansas State University. In 1958, he became a curator at The New York Botanical Garden, and served as editor for various academic journals published by the Garden. Rogerson was involved with the Mycological Society of America, serving in various positions, including President in 1969. He was Managing Editor (1958–89) and Editor-in-chief (1960–65) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> journal Mycologia.|$|E

He was Vice-President (1967), President Elect (1968), and President of the MSA (1969), and secretary-treasurer of the society from 1973 to 1974. He has served as historian of the Mycological Society of America from 1960 to 1990. Rogerson was a generous donor to MSA student travel awards. He died in Ogden on September 7, 2001.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th {{century and}} {{following}} the wide-scale adoption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> method, astrology has been challenged successfully on both theoretical and experimental grounds, and {{has been shown to}} have no scientific validity or explanatory power. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in it has largely declined. While polling studies have demonstrated that approximately 25% of Americans, Canadians, and Britons say they continue to believe that star and planet positions affect their lives, astrology is now recognized as pseudoscience.|$|E

5|$|He was {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science. A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> community with some of his unconventional ideas.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{of science}} {{differ in their}} views of the {{significance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> accomplishments in the medieval Islamic world. The traditionalist view, exemplified by Bertrand Russell, holds that Islamic science, while admirable in many technical ways, lacked the intellectual energy required for innovation and was chiefly important for preserving ancient knowledge, and handing it on to medieval Europe. The revisionist view, exemplified by Abdus Salam, George Saliba and John M. Hobson holds that a Muslim scientific revolution occurred during the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Donald Routledge Hill and Ahmad Y Hassan argue that Islam was {{the driving force behind}} these scientific achievements.|$|E
