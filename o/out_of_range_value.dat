30|$|In the DID {{processing}} step, {{the process}} is performed on a value that directly refers to an individual. The following are common security threats in data de-identification. (A) Errors due to the choice of weak criteria and/or an <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> <b>value</b> (misprocess), (B) when an individual item is identifiable (singled out), (C) linkable if the individual item is directly identifiable through association with other identifiable items, and (D) {{it is possible to}} infer a specific person through the meaning of the attribute of the value (Inference). These four types of threat are the same as those that occur when de-identifying unstructured data. In addition, the rigorous application of the de-identification standard and management are required because the connectivity between data subjects is strong in the case of DID [26 – 31].|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{research}} programme Safeguarding the Brains of our smallest Children (SafeBoosC) aims {{to test the}} {{benefits and harms of}} cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) oximetry in infants born before 28 weeks of gestation. In a phase II trial, infants will be randomised to visible cerebral NIRS oximetry with pre-specified treatment guidelines compared to standard care with blinded NIRS-monitoring. The primary outcome is duration multiplied with the extent outside the normal range of regional tissue oxygen saturation of haemoglobin (rStO 2) of 55 to 85 % in percentage hours (burden). This study was a pilot of the Visible ­Oximetry Group. Material and methods: This was an observational study including ten infants. Results: The median gestational age was 26 weeks + three days, and the median start-up time was 133 minutes after delivery. The median recording time was 69. 7 hours, mean rStO 2 was 64. 2 ± 4. 5 %, median burden of hyper- and hy­poxia was 30. 3 % hours (range 2. 8 - 112. 3). Clinical staff responded to an <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> <b>value</b> 29 times – only once to values above 85 %. In comparison, there were 83 periods of more than ten minutes with an rStO 2 below 55 % and four episodes with an rStO 2 above 85 %. These periods accounted for 72 % of the total hypoxia burden. A total of 18 of the 29 interventions were adjustments of FiO 2 which in 13 of the 18 times resulted in an out-of-range SpO 2. Two infants suffered second-degree burns from the sensor. Five infants died. In all cases, this was unrelated to NIRS monitoring and treatment. Conclusion: The intervention of early cerebral NIRS monitoring proved feasible, but prolonged periods of hypoxia went untreated. Thus, a revision of the treatment guideline and an alarm system is required...|$|E

40|$|Pregnancy is {{associated}} with changes in hematological and biochemistry values, yet there are no African reference intervals for clinical management of pregnant women. We sought to 1) develop laboratory reference intervals during pregnancy and up to 24 weeks postpartum and 2) determine the proportion of women in a previous clinical trial who would be misclassified as having out-of-range values using reference intervals from a United States (U. S.) population. This was a longitudinal sub-study of 120 clinically healthy, HIV-uninfected, self-selected pregnant women seeking antenatal care services at either of two public hospitals in western Kenya. Blood specimens were obtained from consented women at gestational ages 28 and 36 weeks and at 2, 6, 14 and 24 weeks postpartum. Median and 95 % reference intervals were calculated for immune-hematological and biochemistry parameters and compared to reference intervals from a Kenyan and United States (U. S.) population, using Wilcoxon tests. Differences with p≤ 0. 05 were considered significant. Some hematological parameters, including hemoglobin and neutrophils showed significant variations compared to reference intervals for non-pregnant women. Hemoglobin values were significantly lower during pregnancy but were comparable to the values in non-pregnant women by 6 weeks postpartum. CD 4, CD 8 and platelets were significantly elevated in early postpartum but declined gradually, reaching normal levels by 24 weeks postpartum. Using the new hemoglobin reference levels from this study to estimate prevalence of 'out of range' values in a prior Kisumu research cohort of pregnant/postpartum women, resulted in 0 % <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> <b>values,</b> in contrast to 96. 3 % using US non-pregnant reference values. There were substantial differences in U.

40|$|Land use {{regression}} (LUR) {{models have}} become popular {{to explain the}} spatial variation of air pollution concentrations. Independent evaluation is important. We developed LUR models for nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) using measurements conducted at 144 sampling sites in The Netherlands. Sites were randomly divided into training data sets with a size of 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 108, and 120 sites. LUR models were evaluated using (1) internal "leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) " within the training data sets and (2) external "hold-out" validation (HV) against independent test data sets. In addition, we calculated Mean Square Error based validation R(2) s. The mean adjusted model and LOOCV R(2) slightly decreased from 0. 87 to 0. 82 and 0. 83 to 0. 79, respectively, with {{an increasing number of}} training sites. In contrast, the mean HV R(2) was lowest (0. 60) with the smallest training sets and increased to 0. 74 with the largest training sets.

[br/]Hypothesis: Dogs with cardiac disease treated with spironolactone, in addition to conventional therapy, are not at higher risk for adverse events (AEs) than those receiving solely conventional therapy. [br/]Animals: One hundred and ninety-six client-owned dogs with naturally occurring myxomatous mitral valve disease. [br/]Methods: Prospective, double-blinded field study with dogs randomized to receive either spironolactone (2 mg/kg once a day) or placebo in addition to conventional therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, plus furosemide and digoxin if needed). Safety was compared between treatment groups, using the frequency of AEs, death caused by cardiac disease, renal disease, or both, and variations in serum sodium, potassium, urea, and creatinine concentrations. For the latter, population-specific reference intervals were established and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> <b>values</b> (ORV) analyzed.

40|$|Accurate {{clinical}} laboratory reference values {{derived from a}} local or regional population base are required to correctly interpret laboratory results.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for the prediction of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) based {{on the use of}} adverse events, which are defined from four bedside alarms, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). This approach is compared with two logistic regression (LR) models: the prognostic model used in most of the European ICUs, based on the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS II), and a LR that uses the same input variables of the ANN model. Materials and Methods: A large dataset was considered, encompassing forty two ICUs of nine European countries. The recorded features of each patient include the final outcome, the case mix (e. g. age) and the intermediate outcomes, defined as the daily averages <b>of</b> the <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> four biometrics (e. g. heart rate). The SAPS II score requires seventeen static variables (e. g. serum sodium), which are collected within {{the first day of the}} patient's admission. A nonlinear least squares method was used to calibrate the LR models while the ANNs are made up of multilayer perceptrons trained by the RPROP algorithm. A total of 13164 adult patients were randomly divided into training (66 %) and test (33 %) sets. The two methods were evaluated in terms of receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: The event based models predicted the outcome more accurately than the currently used SAPS II model (P< 0. 05), with ROC areas within the ranges 83. 9 - 87. 1 % (ANN) and 82. 6 - 85. 2 % (LR) vs 80 % (LR SAPS II). When using the same inputs, the ANNs outperform the LR (improvement of 1. 3 - 2 %). Conclusion: Better prognostic models can be achieved by adopting low cost and real-time intermediate outcomes rather than static data. FRICE.

The RTOS used, specifically, is uCOS-II. The analysis incorporates a model of an Industrial system made up of microcontrollers which communicate using Zigbee protocol and data is send and received over serial ports of the microcontrollers. One microcontroller functions as the sensor node {{and the other is}} the master which receives values from sensor node and sends out appropriate control commands in response to received sensor data. The performance of the master node is taken into account since all monitoring and control is being dedicated to this master node. A physical condition of the industrial environment is sent, and in the model we shall send real time temperature values from sensor node to master node such that when set points are exceeded then master controller sends a command to switch ON cooling system to sensor node. The time taken from when sensor node sends an <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> temperature <b>value</b> up to the time it will receive control command from master node is used to determine the time response of the system under the three scenarios of polling, interrupts and an RTOS.

We aim to establish common reference {{intervals of}} liver function tests specifically for the Chinese adult population. METHODS: A total of 3210 individuals (20 - 79 years) were enrolled in six representative geographical regions in China. Analytes of ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, total protein, albumin and total bilirubin were measured using three analytical systems mainly used in China. The newly established reference intervals were {{based on the results of}} traceability or multiple systems, and then validated in 21 large hospitals located nationwide qualified by the National External Quality Assessment (EQA) of China. RESULTS: We had been established reference intervals of the seven liver function tests for the Chinese adult population and found there were apparent variances of reference values for the variables for partitioning analysis such as gender(ALT, GGT, total bilirubin), age(ALP, albumin) and region(total protein). More than 86 % of the 21 laboratories passed the validation in all subgroup of reference intervals and overall about 95. 3 % to 98. 8 % of the 1220 validation results fell within the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> the new reference interval for all liver function tests. In comparison with the currently recommended reference intervals in China, the single side observed proportions <b>of</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> reference <b>values</b> from our study for most of the tests deviated significantly from the nominal 2. 5 % such as total bilirubin (15. 2 %), ALP (0. 2 %), albumin (0. 0 %).

40|$|Accurate {{precipitation}} data {{is one of}} the most important inputs for hydrological modeling. Weighing bucket gauges are often used where precipitation is received as both rain and snow. Errors in precipitation records from weighing bucket gauges may be introduced from missing data, bucket decanting (recharge), wind and electronic sensor drift. Manual correction of these errors in {{precipitation data}} records can be extremely tedious and time consuming. An automated methodology for correcting the errors has been developed in Visual Basic 6. 0. The method operates by checking the variation in successive data values against user defined limits and replaces precipitation values outside of those limits with a null value. Excel was used to preprocess the input data file when: <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> data <b>values</b> occur at the beginning of end of file; precipitation occurred during a period of missing data; or gauge maintenance introduced a very small change in the apparent cumulative precipitation. The method was successfully applied to extensive precipitation data records from Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed.

Shear stress is another vital biomechanical stimulus applied on ECs due to the pulsatile blood flow. There is sufficient in vitro evidence that may imply to possible influence these two mechanical stresses have on many essential traits of both ECs and stem cells. For instance, it was demonstrated that shear stress affects gene expression (Paul et al. 2018), morphology and adhesion (Charrier et al. 2018; Paim et al. 2018), extracellular matrix secretion, mechanical properties, and angiogenesis ability (Charoenpanich et al. 2017; La and Tranquillo 2018; Vining and Mooney 2017) of ECs and stem cells.

We determined the prevalence of hypoxaemia and explored associations of clinical risk factors and signs of respiratory distress with hypoxaemia and mortality. After staff training on oxygen saturation (SpO 2) target ranges, we enrolled a consecutive sample of neonates admitted for oxygen and measured SpO 2 at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h post-admission. We estimated the proportion of neonates outside the target range (≥ 34 weeks: ≥ 92 %; Results A total of 477 neonates were enrolled. Prevalence of hypoxaemia was 29. 2 %.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} end-users personalization potentials and {{factors contributing to}} efficient housing occupancy that are embedded in the Housing Occupancy Model (HOM). These factors were sourced through literature review, policy documents along with experts' opinions till consensus was reached on five factors, which are: personalization, satisfaction, environmental condition, attitude towards occupancy and subjective norm to occupancy. Thereafter, an instrument based on Structural Equation Model (SEM) was designed and administered {{to a total of}} 247 respondents. Subsequently, the inter-relationships between and within these factors were tested and fully investigated towards developing a valid HOM. Therefore, the results obtained indicating that the probability (p-value) of Chi-square value is 0. 011 for 'satisfaction' in the prediction of occupier intention is therefore supported. The value obtained for 'environmental condition' in the prediction of occupier intention is 0. 242 which is above the supporting threshold <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 0. 01 - 0. 0985, hence is not supported. Sequentially, the value of 0. 962 obtained for 'subjective norm to occupancy' in the prediction of occupier intention is highly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>range,</b> whereas a <b>value</b> <b>of</b> 0. 006 is supported for 'attitude towards occupancy' in the prediction of occupier intention. 'Personalization' in the prediction of occupier intention obtained a value of 0. 012 which is thus significantly supported. 'Attitude towards occupancy' in the prediction of subjective norm to occupancy with value of 0. 135 is not supported. However, < 0. 001 value for 'personalization' in the prediction of satisfaction is highly significantly supported. The outcome of this HOM will help in effective public housing delivery and occupancy among the low and middle-income earners. In addition it will be beneficial to policy makers, academicians and professionals in arriving at sustainable housing decisions relating to occupancy issues in Malaysia and other developing economies...|$|R
40|$|Bridge {{designers}} {{have a duty}} to identify and implement cost-effective designs that yield minimal rehabilitation frequency and intensity over the facility life and hence least life-cycle preservation cost to the agency and agencies. As such, the bridge engineering community seeks new materials, configurations, and other design elements to meet this objective. This thesis compares the cost, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of using clad or solid stainless steel versus using traditional epoxy-coated carbon steel as the double mat material for reinforcing bridge decks. For each alternative material, it is assumed that all other structural elements in the bridge superstructure and substructure are reinforced with traditional carbon steel. The evaluation methodology incorporates multiple criteria such as the initial and life-cycle costs borne by the agency and the users, and the service life of the bridge deck. Then a rank matrix comparison framework was established to identify the best material alternative {{on the basis of the}} multiple criteria. The results show that using stainless steel as reinforcement material for the bridge deck can lead to significantly higher initial costs but drastically reduced costs over the bridge life cycle. The reduced costs are a result of less frequent and intense rehabilitation. In harsher environments where bridges are more vulnerable to corrosion, the relative benefits of stainless steel are expected to be even higher. Recognizing that the evaluation parameters are not deterministic, sensitivity analysis of the outcome was carried <b>out</b> using <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>values</b> for traffic volume, material prices, discount rates, life-cycle profiles, and user cost percentages. This thesis thus demonstrates the superior long-term cost-effectiveness of stainless steel as a reinforcement material for highway bridge decks. ...|$|R
