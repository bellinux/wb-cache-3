5|$|From {{his early}} student years, Dmowski {{was opposed to}} {{socialism}} and suspicious of federalism; he desired Polish independence and a strong Polish state, and saw socialism and conciliatory federalist policies as prioritizing an international idea over the national <b>one.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> years he became an influential European nationalist thinker.|$|E
5|$|The church's {{appearance}} in the mid-16th century, shortly before its completion, is known from a woodcut by Girolamo Franzini. Its facade appears almost square; at its center there was a portal with a tympanum, surmounted by a large fanlight opened by a round window. On its side were three rows of pilasters with two pairs of niches, <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> other. A bell-gable was {{on one side of}} the roof.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, French {{public opinion}} was {{strongly}} {{in favour of}} the outcome of the conference, the only criticism coming from the far left that Republican ships would not receive direct protection. The German mood was restrained, where the press were satisfied by the Soviet exclusion from patrols. In Spain, the Republicans– on the verge of disaster– were largely in favour, and the Nationalists strongly against. The Republicans praised the improved safety of the shipping routes, but were somewhat unhappy that belligerent rights had not been granted to both sides. The Nationalists made several complaints, including <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> route recommended to shipping, but none of these resulted in changes to the agreement. The agreement was welcomed by other members of the League of Nations. Italian historians tend to downplay the importance of the Nyon Conference, often seeing it as a mere extension of the Non-Intervention Committee.|$|E
5|$|On July 24, 2015, Pressey {{signed with}} the Portland Trail Blazers, but was waived on October 23 after {{appearing}} in four preseason games.

5|$|Some mammals are omnivores {{and display}} {{varying degrees of}} carnivory and herbivory, {{generally}} leaning in favor of one more than the other. Since plants and meat are digested differently, there is a preference for <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> other, as in bears where some species may be mostly carnivorous and others mostly herbivorous. They are grouped into three categories: mesocarnivory (50-70% meat), hypercarnivory (70% and greater of meat), and hypocarnivory (50% or less of meat). The dentition of hypocarnivores consists of dull, triangular carnassial teeth meant for grinding food. Hypercarnivores, however, have conical teeth and sharp carnassials meant for slashing, {{and in some cases}} strong jaws for bone-crushing, {{as in the case of}} hyenas, allowing them to consume bones; some extinct groups, notably the Machairodontinae, had saber-shaped canines.|$|E
5|$|The Al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo {{seems to}} have had a similar {{projecting}} entrance to the Great Mosque of Mahdiya. The original building had an open central courtyard with three arcades. Its layout was similar to the Kairouan and Samarra mosques. These had round arches on pre-Islamic columns with Corinthian capitals. There were three domes (indicative of the location of the prayer hall), two at the corners of the qibla wall and <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> prayer niche, and a small brick minaret over the main entrance. The gallery around the courtyard had series of columns and the prayer hall, which had the domes built over it, had five more rows of five pillars.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorm {{activity}} {{near the}} eye soon decreased in coverage, and Lidia began a weakening trend. Because of two troughs, <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> northern Gulf of California and another over the Southwestern United States, the weakening system began to re-curve northeast. Heading towards mainland Mexico, the hurricane weakened significantly {{a day after}} its peak, in which Lidia was only a mid-level Category2 hurricane. Continuing to weaken, Lidia made landfall in Sinaloa at 1800UTC on September13. Shortly after landfall, Hurricane Lidia then accelerated northeastward and then east-northeastward. It weakened to a depression just after crossing the international border with Texas. Tropical Depression Lidia dissipated near Austin on September14. The remnants of the cyclone were absorbed by a cold front.|$|E

5|$|To the north, {{from the}} Masan–Chinju highway to the Nam River, {{there were several}} easily {{defensible}} positions. The best one was the high ground near Chungam-ni, which controlled the important road junction connecting the Masan road with the <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Nam River to Uiryong. It was essential for the 25th Infantry Division's right flank connect with the left flank of the 24th Infantry Division at {{the confluence of the}} Nam and the Naktong Rivers. Therefore, the 25th Infantry Division also moved to protect the Komam-ni road intersection where the Chindong-ni–Haman road met the Masan–Chinju highway.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Lucille was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to have its name retired in the Western Pacific basin. Lucille {{was identified as a}} weak tropical depression on May25, 1960, to the east of the Philippines. Tracking northwestward, the system failed to develop and warnings on it were discontinued on May27. At the same time, a second system began organizing along the west coast of Luzon. The two systems ultimately merged into <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Philippines between May28 and 29. Now tracking northeastward, the system re-intensified and became a tropical storm on May30. Lucille attained its peak intensity later that day with winds of 85km/h (50mph). As it accelerated over open waters, the system brushed the islands of Iwo Jima and Chichi-jima before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on June1. The remnants of Lucille were last noted on June4 near the International Date Line.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, {{pitching}} the Giants' home opener, Cain threw {{a complete}} game shut out, striking out 11. Facing 28 batters in 9 innings, <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> minimum, he allowed a single baserunner on a hit to James McDonald, the pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates. It {{was the third}} one-hitter of Cain's career. In his next start, on April 18, Cain threw another 9 shutout innings using only 91 pitches, dueling Cliff Lee of the Phillies who threw 102 pitches over 10 scoreless innings. The first 9 innings took only 1 hour and 49 minutes. The Giants {{went on to win}} in the 11th inning. Following a dominant first half, Cain was selected to the All-Star Game and was chosen by manager Tony La Russa to be the NL's starting pitcher. On July 10 at Kauffman Stadium, Cain allowed a leadoff single to Derek Jeter before retiring the six remaining hitters he faced; he was the winning pitcher in an 8–0 decision. On July 21, Cain hit his sixth career home run, off of Phillies' pitcher Cole Hamels in the third inning of a 10-inning, 65 Giants' victory. Later in that inning Hamels hit his first career home run off of Cain, making this the first time since 2002 when two pitchers have homered off of each other in the same game (Kevin Millwood and Denny Stark were the last to do it).|$|E

5|$|The central {{range was}} begun around 1500, {{possibly}} as a two-storey building containing a great hall, although only fragments {{of this building}} remain. The south entrance to the tower house was blocked up, and replaced with a ground floor entrance from the east. A new stair tower, with a broad spiral stair, was built at the south-east corner. Originally topped by a conical roof, this stair gave access to the upper floors in the tower, and to the central range. Around 1570, the 4th Earl of Morton rebuilt the block, extending it further south to form new apartments. This block, forming the present three-storey central range, includes a vaulted kitchen and cellar in the basement, with suites of rooms above. The two bedrooms {{on the first floor}} each have their own closets and garderobes, or privies. The west apartment is accessed from the terraced garden, via another stair to the south-west, and has a private stair which led up to another chamber above, suggesting that these were the Earl and Countesses apartments. The upper storey, whose timber floor is now missing, comprised three more apartments, including <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> stair. The exterior of the block is decorated with a horizontal decorative strip of masonry known as a string course. One first-floor window is decorated with carved stone pilasters and strapwork, in a similar style to windows at Edinburgh Castle and Drochil Castle, in the Borders, both of which were built under Morton's Regency.|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} Persona 3. He {{moves into the}} Iwatodai dorm, {{learning}} {{of his ability to}} summon the Personas Orpheus and Thanatos of The Death Arcana when the dorm is attacked by Shadows during the Dark Hour. Mitsuru asks him to join SEES and he is later elected the team's leader in combat. The protagonist is unique among his cohorts in that he has the Wild Card ability which enables him to wield multiple Personas and switch between them during battle. Over the course of the game, he also gains Messiah of the Judgement Arcana and Orpheus Telos of the Fool Arcana in Persona 3 FES. With the power of the Wild Card he has access to over 150 different Personas. He is also the only character with access to the Velvet Room, in which the player is able to fuse together multiple Personas together to create a new and more powerful <b>one.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> course of the game, the player is challenged to manage the protagonist's day-to-day schedule as he attends school, takes part in extracurricular activities, and spends time with classmates and other characters. Igor, the proprietor of the Velvet Room, encourages the protagonist to form Social Links with people, as they will determine his potential in combat. Social Links with characters in-game are represented by one of the Major Arcana and grants various bonuses during Persona fusion, increasing the player's proficiency in battle.|$|E
