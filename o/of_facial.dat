5|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, {{have been found}} to display a preparedness for social interaction. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation <b>of</b> <b>facial</b> gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of socialization or social construction. Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behavior and identity through genetics.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{well-established}} writing system for ASL, written sign language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a sign language {{seems to be that}} of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825. However, written sign language remained marginal among the public. In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation <b>of</b> <b>facial</b> expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used this system for his 1965 A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles.|$|E

5|$|Like New World monkeys, strepsirrhines rely on scent marking {{for much}} of their communication. This {{involves}} smearing secretions from epidermal scent glands on tree branches, along with urine and feces. In some cases, strepsirrhines may anoint themselves with urine (urine washing). Body postures and gestures may be used, although the long snout, non-mobile lips, and reduced facial enervation restrict the use <b>of</b> <b>facial</b> expressions in strepsirrhines. Short-range calls, long-range calls, and alarm calls are also used. Nocturnal species are more constrained {{by the lack of}} light, so their communication systems differ from those of diurnal species, often using long-range calls to claim their territory.|$|E

40|$|According to its course, the {{branches}} <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> artery are arranged under two headings; cervical component (branches in the digastric triangle) and facial component (branches on the face). Variations in {{the branches}} <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> component <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> artery have been frequently studied and reported. However, variations in the cervical component are rare. A hitherto unreported variant of the cervical component <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> artery was observed in a 55 -year-old male cadaver during routine undergraduate dissection. The facial artery was arising from the external carotid artery as a common trunk with the lingual artery in the right carotid triangle and its ascending palatine and tonsillar branches were arising from the external carotid artery. It is important for surgeons and radiologists {{to be aware of}} the normal anatomy <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> artery and the external carotid artery. Herein, we describe the detailed anatomical features of the variant branching pattern <b>of</b> the right <b>facial</b> artery and its clinical implications...|$|R
40|$|Background: Facial {{paralysis}} {{remains as}} one of the major morbidities of surgery of cerebellopontine angle tumors. The preoperative standard Magnetic Resonance Image does not identify, with precision, the path <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> nerve. Case description: The authors describe a case of a 56  years-old female with a cerebellopontine angle meningioma, submitted to preoperative Diffusion Tensor Tractography to identification of the course <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> nerve, and correlate its position with the intraoperative findings. There was an accurate correlation between the path <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> nerve revealed by preoperative DTT and the route of the nerve identified during surgery. Conclusion: The preoperative identification <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> nerve seems to be possible by tractography in meningiomas of the cerebellopontine angle. It is possible that this technique may have utility in larger tumors, where the intraoperative identification <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> path can be more difficult...|$|R
5|$|Lochner {{probably}} saw van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece {{during his}} visit to the Netherlands and seems to have borrowed a number of its compositional elements. The similarities include {{the manner in which the}} figures engage with their space and the emphasis on and rendering of elements such as brocades, gems and metals. Some figures in Lochner's paintings are directly borrowed from Ghent, and a number <b>of</b> <b>facial</b> features match those seen in van Eyck. His Virgin with the Violet has often been compared to van Eyck's 1439 Virgin at the Fountain. Similarly to those in van Eyck's work, Lochner's angels often sing or play musical instruments, including lutes and organs.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary work on L.A. Noire {{began after}} the {{founding}} of developer Team Bondi in 2003.

BBC News reporter Kev Geoghegan estimated that the development budget for the game exceeded US$50 million, making L.A. Noire {{one of the most}} expensive video games ever made.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles <b>of</b> <b>facial</b> expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|E
40|$|A refined {{technique}} is described for non invasive examination <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> motor pathways by {{stimulation of the}} extra- and intracranial segment <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> nerve and the facial motor cortex. Surface recordings from the nasalis muscle {{rather than from the}} orbicularis oris muscle were used, since the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) from this muscle showed a more clearly defined onset. Electrical extracranial stimulation <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> nerve at the stylomastoid fossa in 14 healthy subjects yielded a mean distal motor latency of 3. 7 ms (SD 0. 46), comparable with reported latencies to the orbicularis oris muscle. Using a magnetic stimulator, transcranial stimulation <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> nerve was performed. The mechanism <b>of</b> transcranial magnetic <b>facial</b> nerve stimulation was studied using recordings on 12 patients who had facial nerve lesions at different locations, and with intraoperative direct measurements in four patients undergoing posterior fossa surgery. The actual site of stimulation could be localised to the proximal part <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> canal, and a mean "transosseal conduction time" of 1. 2 ms (SD 0. 18) was calculated. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {{played an important role in}} mediating the magnetically induced stimulating currents. Finally, with transcranial magnetic stimulation <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> motor cortex, clearly discernible CMAPs could be produced when voluntary activation <b>of</b> several <b>facial</b> muscles was used to facilitate the responses. From this, a central motor conduction time of 5. 1 ms was calculated (SD 0. 60, 6 subjects) ...|$|R

5|$|The sitter is unknown, {{although}} some art historians have speculated on her identity. On {{the grounds of}} similarity <b>of</b> <b>facial</b> features, writer Wilhelm Stein suggested in the early 20th century {{that she might be}} Marie de Valengin, the illegitimate daughter of Philip the Good of Burgundy. However, this is a contentious assertion and not widely held. Because her hands are shown as resting on the painting's lower frame, art historians generally accept that this was an independent portrait, rather than a devotional work. It is possible that it was intended as a pendant to a picture of the woman's husband, however no other portrait has been suggested as a likely companion.|$|E

5|$|Alan Pattillo, a {{longtime}} scriptwriter and director for APF, was appointed the company's first official script editor in late 1964. This move was aimed {{to reduce the}} burden on Gerry Anderson who, while reserving his producer's right to overall creative control, had grown weary of revising scripts himself. Direction of episodes was assigned in pairs: veterans Pattillo and David Elliott alternated with the less-experienced Desmond Saunders and newcomer David Lane for each month's filming. Due to the difficulties of setting up takes, progress was slow: even on a productive day, it was rare for the crew to complete more than two minutes of puppet footage. In a contemporary interview, Hill noted that Thunderbirds contained several times as many shots as a typical live-action series. He explained that rapid editing was necessary {{on account of the}} characters' lack <b>of</b> <b>facial</b> expression, which made it difficult to sustain the viewer's interest {{for more than a few}} seconds per shot.|$|E
50|$|Of {{surgical}} importance are two branches <b>of</b> the <b>facial</b> nerve {{that also}} {{pass through the}} middle ear space.

5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{reconcile}} some of the troubling uncertainties and contradictions within the case. To explain the degree <b>of</b> <b>facial</b> resemblance (which even Cockburn accepted) of the Claimant to the Tichborne family, Onslow suggested in The Englishman that Orton's mother was an illegitimate daughter of Sir Henry Tichborne, Roger Tichborne's grandfather. An alternative story has Orton's mother seduced by James Tichborne, making Orton and Roger half-brothers. Other versions have Orton and Roger as companions in crime in Australia, with Orton killing Roger and assuming his identity. The Claimant's daughter by Mary Ann Bryant, Teresa Mary Agnes, maintained that her father confessed to her that he had killed Arthur Orton and thus could not disclose details of his Australian years. There is no direct evidence for any of these theories. Teresa continued to proclaim her identity as a Tichborne daughter, and in 1924 was imprisoned for making threats and demands for money to the family.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{disturbances}} {{can occur}} {{in the early stages}} of the disease and sometimes prior to diagnosis, and increase in prevalence with duration of the disease. The most common cognitive deficit in PD is executive dysfunction, which can include problems with planning, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, inhibiting inappropriate actions, initiating appropriate actions, working memory, and control of attention. Other cognitive difficulties include slowed cognitive processing speed, impaired recall and impaired perception and estimation of time. Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues. Visuospatial difficulties are also part of the disease, seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests <b>of</b> <b>facial</b> recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines. A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared to the general population.|$|E

The game is notable for being the first to use MotionScan, developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan functions by recording actors with 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge {{whether or not they are}} lying. Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget at more than US $50 million, which would make it one of the most expensive video games ever made.|$|E

5|$|The gray wolf's {{expressive}} {{behavior is}} more complex than that of the coyote and golden jackal, as necessitated by its group living and hunting habits. While less gregarious canids generally possess simple repertoires of visual signals, wolves have more varied signals that subtly inter grade in intensity. When neutral, the legs are not stiffened, the tail hangs down loosely, the face is smooth, the lips untensed, and the ears point in no particular direction. Postural communication in wolves consists of a variety <b>of</b> <b>facial</b> expressions, tail positions and piloerection. Aggressive, or self-assertive wolves are characterized by their slow and deliberate movements, high body posture and raised hackles, while submissive ones carry their bodies low, sleeken their fur and lower their ears and tail. When a breeding male encounters a subordinate family member, it may stare at it, standing erect and still with the tails horizontal to its spine. Two forms of submissive behavior are recognized: passive and active. Passive submission usually occurs as a reaction to the approach of a dominant animal, and consists of the submissive wolf lying partly on its back and allowing the dominant wolf to sniff its anogenital area. Active submission occurs often as a form of greeting, and involves the submissive wolf approaching another in a low posture, and licking the other wolf's face. When wolves are together, they commonly indulge in behaviors such as nose pushing, jaw wrestling, cheek rubbing and facial licking. The mouthing of each other's muzzles is a friendly gesture, while clamping on the muzzle with bared teeth is a dominance display.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container <b>of</b> <b>facial</b> mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

For the sake of clear demonstrations, we choose data-driven expressive speech animation generation and expressive facial motion editing as two concrete application examples. Through a comparative user study, we showed that comparing with the traditional facial animation algorithms, the introduced perceptually guided expressive facial animation algorithms can significantly increase the emotional expressiveness and perceptual believability <b>of</b> synthesized <b>facial</b> animations...|$|R
