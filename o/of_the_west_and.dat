5|$|Early {{inhabitants}} of the territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest. Portuguese explorers reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos Camarões (Shrimp River), which became Cameroon in English. Fulani soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century, and various ethnic groups <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>and</b> northwest established powerful chiefdoms and fondoms. Cameroon became a German colony in 1884 known as Kamerun.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous {{resistance}} was stubborn, and Montejo {{did not complete}} the conquest of western and central Honduras until 1539. Once he had established Spanish control there, he headed east to pacify the Olancho valley. Although the conquest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>and</b> centre of the territory was difficult, and the natives were well organised, resistance in the east took much longer to put down, and rebellions there lasted throughout the colonial period.|$|E

5|$|The Office of Arts and Crafts, {{subordinate}} to the Minister Steward, produced weapons, bronze mirrors, vessel wares, and other goods. The Office of Manufactures, also {{subordinate to}} the Minister Steward, made the cheaper weapons, utensils, and armor.

5|$|The dialects of Jèrriais {{differ in}} {{phonology}} and, {{to a lesser}} extent, lexis between parishes, with the most marked differences to be heard between those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>and</b> east. Many place names are in Jèrriais, and French and English place names are also to be found. Anglicisation of the place names increased apace with the migration of English people to the island.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{discovery}} of many hundreds of Iron Age sites in Scotland {{there is still a}} great deal that remains to be explained {{about the nature of the}} Celtic life in the early Christian era. Unfortunately radiocarbon dating for this period is problematic and chronological sequences are poorly understood. For a variety of reasons much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>and</b> north and both excavations and analysis of societal structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.|$|E
5|$|In early 1922 Marquis started {{considering}} {{working as}} an Indian agency physician. This would both satisfy his longstanding interest in the Native Americans <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West,</b> <b>and</b> provide a subject that might {{be of interest to}} publishers. In May, Marquis applied to the Civil Service Commission. While waiting, he began work on a novel, Boute, an unfinished story based on his wartime experiences. In June, Marquis was appointed agency physician to the Northern Cheyenne. He arrived in the agency village of Lame Deer, Montana, in early July.|$|E
5|$|In {{the war for}} independence, the {{division}} of assimilados versus indigenas peoples masked the inter-ethnic conflict between the various native tribes, a division {{that emerged in the}} early 1970s. The Union of Peoples of Angola, the predecessor to the FNLA, only controlled 15% of Angola's territory during the independence war, excluding MPLA-controlled Cabinda. The People's Republic of China openly backed UNITA upon independence despite the mutual support from its adversary South Africa and UNITA's pro-Western tilt. The PRC's support for Savimbi came in 1965, a year after he left the FNLA. China saw Holden Roberto and the FNLA as the stooge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>and</b> the MPLA as the Soviet Union's proxy. With the Sino-Soviet split, South Africa presented the least odious of allies to the PRC.|$|E

Her other major films include the neo-noir action film Max Payne (2008), the post-apocalyptic action film The Book of Eli (2010), the romantic comedy film Friends with Benefits (2011), the comedy film Ted (2012), the fantasy film Oz the Great and Powerful (2013) as the Wicked Witch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West,</b> <b>and</b> the comedy film Bad Moms (2016).|$|E
5|$|More goods became {{available}} in St. Louis during the economic recovery, {{largely as a}} result of the new steamboat power. Wholesalers, new banks, and other retail stores opened starting in the late 1820s and early 1830s. The fur trade continued as a major industry into the 1830s. In 1822, Jedediah Smith joined William H. Ashley's St. Louis fur trading company. Smith would later be known for his explorations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>and</b> for being the first American to travel overland to California. New fur trade companies such as the Rocky Mountain Fur Company pioneered trails west. Although beaver fur lost its popularity in the 1840s, St. Louis continued as a hub of buffalo hide and other furs.|$|E
5|$|New {{construction}} has occurred {{throughout the city}} {{since the start of}} the 21st century. Important retail and office developments have occurred in West Omaha such as the Village Pointe shopping center and several business parks including First National Business Park and parks for Bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>and</b> C Industries, Inc and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and several others. Downtown and Midtown Omaha have both seen the development of a significant number of condominiums in recent years. In Midtown Omaha significant mixed-use projects are underway. The site of the former Ak-Sar-Ben arena has been redeveloped into a mixed-use development Aksarben Village. In January 2009 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska announced plans to build a new 10 story, $98 million headquarters, in the Aksarben Village, completed in Spring 2011. Gordmans is also currently building their new corporate headquarters in Aksarben. The other major mixed-use development is Midtown Crossing at Turner Park. Developed by Mutual of Omaha, the development includes several condominium towers and retail businesses built around Omaha's Turner Park.|$|E

5|$|The Philippines {{was named}} in honor of King PhilipII of Spain. Spanish {{explorer}} Ruy López de Villalobos, during his expedition in 1542, named the islands of Leyte and Samar Felipinas after the then-Prince of Asturias. Eventually the name Las Islas Filipinas would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago. Before that became commonplace, other names such as Islas del Poniente (Islands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West)</b> <b>and</b> Magellan's name for the islands San Lázaro were also used by the Spanish to refer to the islands.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} Moglena was {{completed}} in 1015 or 1016. In 1017, Diogenes and David Arianites led troops to plunder the fertile plain of Pelagonia, where they captured many prisoners and livestock. Soon after, Basil II placed Diogenes {{in charge of the}} tagmata of the Scholai <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>and</b> of Thessalonica, and tasked him with pursuing Tsar Ivan Vladislav. The Bulgarian ruler set up an ambush for his pursuers, but Basil was informed in time, and led the rest of his troops to Diogenes' aid, scattering the Bulgarians.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} concern facing lemur populations is habitat destruction and degradation. Deforestation {{takes the form}} of local subsistence use, such as slash and burn agriculture (referred to as tavy in Malagasy), the creation of pasture for cattle through burning, and legal and illegal gathering of wood for firewood or charcoal production; commercial mining; and the illegal logging of precious hardwoods for foreign markets. After centuries of unsustainable use, as well as rapidly escalating forest destruction since 1950, less than 60,000km2 (23,000sq mi) or 10% of Madagascar's land area remains forested. Only 17,000km2 (6,600sq mi) or 3% of the island's land area is protected and due to dire economic conditions and political instability, most of the protected areas are ineffectively managed and defended. Some protected areas were set aside because they were naturally protected by their remote, isolated location, often on steep cliffs. Other areas, such as the dry forests and spiny forests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>and</b> south, receive little protection and are in serious danger of being destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The main façade (south elevation) of Literary Hall {{is divided}} into three bays, and its west and east {{elevations}} are divided into five bays. Each of the building's bays consists of a double-hung sash wooden window, with nine panes of glass within each sash. The windows are symmetrically placed within recessed brick panels that are defined at the first and second stories of the building with elementary brick ribs, or pseudo-pilasters, that form the outer surface of the building's exterior walls and provide separation of the three bays of the main façade and the five bays <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>and</b> east elevations. The windows are framed by white wooden louvered window shutters. The building's brick is laid in an American bond pattern, with five courses of stretchers between every course of headers.|$|E
5|$|This design {{followed}} the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms {{scattered over the}} two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on {{the first and second}} floors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>and</b> east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to {{the east side of the}} house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second. This older concept is more clearly exemplified at the Elizabethan Hardwick Hall in neighbouring Derbyshire.|$|E
5|$|Wicked: The Untold Story of the Witches of Oz is a Broadway musical {{with music}} and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman. It {{is based on the}} 1995 Gregory Maguire novel , an {{alternative}} telling of the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz and L. Frank Baum's classic 1900 novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The musical is told {{from the perspective of the}} witches of the Land of Oz; its plot begins before and continues after Dorothy's arrival in Oz from Kansas, and it includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum's novel. Wicked tells the story of two unlikely friends, Elphaba (the Wicked Witch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West)</b> <b>and</b> Galinda (whose name later changes to Glinda the Good Witch), who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the Wizard's corrupt government and, ultimately, Elphaba's public fall from grace.|$|E
