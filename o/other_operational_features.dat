Toll plazas are located at each of those interchanges. The toll plaza at Bristow {{was the first of}} the new plazas reconstructed incorporating [...] "state-of-the-industry" [...] electronic toll collection (ETC) and <b>other</b> <b>operational</b> <b>features</b> for the convenience and safety of motorists utilizing the turnpike system. Additional toll plazas, similar in design, were subsequently reconstructed at Chandler, Stroud, Kellyville, and Sapulpa. A new interchange 11 mi east of the western terminus was added at Hogback Road in Luther, and was opened in May 2011.|$|E

40|$|Activated sludge sewage {{treatment}} plants that {{were affected by}} biological foams attributed {{to the presence of}} actinomycetes were surveyed in Queensland, Australia. Nocardia amarae and Nocardia pinensis were the predominant organisms found to accumulate selectively in the foam phase. Foaming was shown to be a significant problem in Queensland with 92 % of surveyed plants being affected. A total of 60 % of these plants suffered from bulking, however, no correlation between these two problems was noted. No operational, design, influent or weather feature was found to be consistent in all foaming plants. Apart {{from the fact that the}} plants were all variations of the activated sludge process, the only other aspect shared by them was that large numbers of filamentous bacteria were present in the foam. Field scale trials that evaluated control strategies against actinomycete foaming or scumming in activated sludge plants are described. The effects were assessed of: altering the rate of return activated sludge recycle, dosing of the aeration tank with anaerobic digester products, the addition of a commerical product specifically designed to control foaming, altering sludge age, varying levels of mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and altering <b>other</b> <b>operational</b> <b>features.</b> These strategies did not efficaciously control scumming in activated sludge, however, some operational features were highlighted as exacerbating the problem...|$|E

We explain the aims and structure (investigation area) of the questionnaire, the main content of each investigation area and the selected sample of convergence regions involved. The first questionnaire is divided into four key investigation areas; the aims of this first survey are: to define the need for capacity building {{in relation to the}} new EU regulatory framework; identify what type of support may be more effective (exchange of personnel, community of practices and learning, online platform, peer-to-peer assistance); identify which Managing Authority is available to share its experience and good practices and what is available to receive them. The questionnaire will be sent to all Managing Authorities and Certifying Authorities of the Member States. The second questionnaire is divided into four key investigation areas that try to analysis the main results of the microcredit/microfinance programming activity, the target group and <b>other</b> <b>operational</b> <b>features</b> and, finally, the Monitoring and reporting activities. Finally, the chapter tries to show the prospects of the programming activities in the microcredit sector with EU structural funds {{in the context of the}} on-going planning processes with regard to implementing Financial Instruments in 2014 - 2020 (Horizon) ...|$|E
40|$|Plasmatron reformers {{are being}} {{developed}} at MIT and ArvinMeritor [1]. In these reformers a special low power electrical discharge is used to promote partial oxidation conversion of hydrocarbon fuels into hydrogen and CO. The partial oxidation reaction of this very fuel rich mixture is difficult to initiate. The plasmatron provides continuous enhanced volume initiation. To minimize electrode erosion and electrical power requirements, a low current, high voltage discharge with wide area electrodes is used. The reformers operate at or slightly above atmospheric pressure. Plasmatron reformers provide the advantages of rapid startup and transient response; efficient conversion of the fuel to hydrogen rich gas; compact size; relaxation or elimination of reformer catalyst requirements; and capability to process difficult to reform fuels, such as diesel and bio-oils. These advantages facilitate use of onboard hydrogen-generation technology for diesel exhaust after-treatment. Plasma-enhanced reformer technology can provide substantial conversion even {{without the use of}} a catalyst. Recent progress includes a substantial decrease in electrical power consumption (to about 200 W), increased flow rate (above 1 g/s of diesel fuel corresponding to approximately 40 kW of chemical energy), soot suppression and improvements in <b>other</b> <b>operational</b> <b>features</b> [...] Plasmatron reformer technology has been evaluated for regeneration of NOx adsorber after-treatment systems. At ArvinMeritor tests were performed on a dual-leg NOx adsorber system using a Cummins 8. 3 L diesel engine both in a test cell and on a vehicle. A NOx adsorber system was tested using the plasmatron reformer as a regenerator and without the reformer i. e., with straight diesel fuel based regeneration as the baseline case. The plasmatron reformer was shown to improve NOx regeneration significantly compared to the baseline diesel case. The net result of these initial tests was a significant decrease in fuel penalty, roughly 50 % at moderate adsorber temperatures. This fuel penalty improvement is accompanied by a dramatic drop in slipped hydrocarbon emissions, which decreased by 90 % or more. Significant advantages are demonstrated across a wide range of engine conditions and temperatures. The study also indicated the potential to regenerate NOx adsorbers at low temperatures where diesel fuel based regeneration is not effective, such as those typical of idle conditions. Two vehicles, a bus and a light duty truck, have been equipped for plasmatron reformer NOx adsorber regeneration tests...|$|E
