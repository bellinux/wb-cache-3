5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Georgia and Duke University, Boyd began in academia {{as a professor of}} physics at West Georgia College. He then became a professor at Georgia Tech and a prominent researcher at the Engineering Experiment Station, now known as the Georgia Tech Research Institute. At the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd helped spur the organization's mainstay: federally funded electronics research and development. Along with fellow Georgia Tech researchers Gerald Rosselot and Glen P. Robinson, Boyd was influential in the founding of Scientific Atlanta, where he was a board member for 25 years. As director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Engineering</b> Experiment Station, Boyd focused on the recruitment of talented engineers and an increase in physical space available to the organization, including the establishment of nuclear research at Georgia Tech with a radioisotopes laboratory and the construction of the Frank H. Neely Research Reactor.|$|E
5|$|By 1997, {{the start}} of {{construction}} of the Hampstead Bypass was proposed {{for three to four}} years in the future; at that time, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engineering</b> phase was complete but most of the highway right-of-way had yet to be purchased. The three-year timeframe was again put forth in 2001. Finally, in 2004, officials announced that the bypass would begin construction in autumn 2005. Construction finally got underway in summer 2006. Houcksville Road's bridge over the bypass and the highway's bridges over Shiloh Road and Indian Run were completed in 2007. The roundabouts at MD 482 and {{at the southern end of}} the bypass opened, without connections to the under-construction bypass, in April and May 2009, respectively. The roundabout at the northern end of the bypass opened when the bypass opened to traffic on August 6, 2009. To minimize disruption to the bog turtle habitat, MDSHA installed tunnels under the bypass for the turtles to use and employed goats to consume invasive species in the habitat area near the bypass rather than remove them with mechanical mowers. Old MD 30 through the center of Hampstead was redesignated MD 30 Business when the bypass opened.|$|E

Returning to the United States in June 1935, Casey was posted to Eastport, Maine as chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Engineering</b> Division at the Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project, a New Deal public works project. There, he established a concrete testing laboratory under Charles E. Wuerpel which {{is now part of}} the Structures Laboratory at the Waterways Experiment Station at Vicksburg, Mississippi.

5|$|Once {{he moved}} to Nutting, Bushnell took over the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engineering</b> work for the game; Dabney has stated that he advised Bushnell {{on some of the}} design, and that some of the construction was done by Steve Bristow, an intern at Ampex. There is disagreement in interviews with Bushnell and Dabney as to how much work Dabney did on the final cabinet, with Dabney claiming credit for the controls, sound, power supply, initial wooden cabinet, and invention of the hyperspace color inversion, while Bushnell claims credit for everything but the sound, cabinet, power supply, and monitor. By August 1971, an initial prototype of the game—now named Computer Space to be similar to Computer Quiz—was complete, and Syzygy moved on to location testing. They installed the game at the Dutch Goose bar near Stanford University, where it met with great success. Nutting was heartened by the response and rushed to make several finished cabinets for the Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition in October. Further location tests found a less enthusiastic response from customers confused by the game mechanics and controls, and Syzygy hurriedly tried to adjust the game to be more understandable to players.|$|E
5|$|Simpson's {{selection}} of Boyd as interim president {{was influenced by}} Boyd's previous experience as an academic administrator, his experience as director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Engineering</b> Experiment Station, and Boyd's ongoing position on the station's board of directors. The chancellor hoped this combination would help resolve a brewing controversy over whether the Engineering Experiment Station should be integrated into Georgia Tech's academic units to improve both entities' competitiveness for federal money. The station had sizable and growing support {{from the state of}} Georgia and its Industrial Development Council, which developed products and methods and provided technical assistance for Georgia industry. However, due in part to efforts made by Boyd and previous station director Gerald Rosselot, the station increasingly relied on electronics research funding from the federal government. In 1971, funding to both Georgia Tech's academic units and the Experiment Station began to suffer due to a combination of a sharp decline in state funds and cuts to federal science, research, and education funding {{after the end of the}} Space Race funding boom. Similar institutions, such as the Battelle Memorial Institute, Stanford Research Institute, and the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute had weathered this storm by becoming exceedingly good at obtaining research contracts.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} crew numbered 103 {{officers and}} 1,962 enlisted men. The crew {{was divided into}} twelve divisions of between 180 and 220 men. The first six divisions {{were assigned to the}} ship's armament, divisions one to four for the main and secondary batteries and five and six manning anti-aircraft guns. The seventh division consisted of specialists, including cooks and carpenters, and the eighth division consisted of ammunition handlers. The radio operators, signalmen, and quartermasters were assigned to the ninth division. The last three divisions were the engine room personnel. When Bismarck left port, fleet staff, prize crews, and war correspondents increased the crew complement to over 2,200 men. Roughly 200 of the engine room personnel came from the light cruiser , which had been lost during Operation Weserübung, the German invasion of Norway. Bismarcks crew published a ship's newspaper titled Die Schiffsglocke (The Ship's Bell); this paper was only published once, on 23 April 1941, by the commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engineering</b> department, Gerhard Junack.|$|E

5|$|While he was {{the third}} {{president}} of West Georgia College, Boyd increased faculty, degrees, programs, and both undergraduate and graduate enrollment on the campus. Boyd racially integrated the campus in 1963, unprompted by a court order, and oversaw immense construction projects that dramatically expanded the campus to support the increased (and future) enrollment. Hired away {{to serve as the}} University System of Georgia's Vice Chancellor for Academic Development in 1970, he was almost immediately reassigned to be Georgia Tech's interim president. During his tenure at Georgia Tech from 1971 to 1972, Boyd resolved difficult issues in the attempted takeover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Engineering</b> Experiment Station by previous Georgia Tech president Arthur G.

5|$|The team used Unreal Engine 2.5 {{to build}} and test prototypes of the {{real-time}} strategy elements, allowing the designers and gameplay programmers to commence work while another team focused on creating a new game engine. Having completed the multiplayer stage battle portion of the game first, Double Fine found it easy to gradually introduce the player to its more advanced aspects during the single-player campaign. The game-world's large size and varied content necessitated a game engine with streaming capabilities, allowing the game to seamlessly load and unload content as needed — this was also something the team had no prior experience with. Double Fine developed several in-house tools to help streamline the content-creation process for the game's world: an automated testing bot, RoBert (so named {{after one of the}} test engineers), was created to put daily builds of the game through continuous and rigorous testing, automatically reporting any errors to developers, while the Multi-User-Editor allowed the game's artists to simultaneously work on the game-world without fear of overwriting each other's work. The team ran into content management issues late in the game's development as more of the game's assets neared completion. Within the span of a few months the combined asset size tripled, endangering the game's ability to fit on a DVD and causing performance problems throughout the company's development systems. With the help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engineering</b> team, they were eventually able to overcome the performance issues and re-optimize the content for space.|$|E
