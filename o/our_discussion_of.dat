40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this paper to explore the theory of high {{temperature}} superconductivity. Much of the motivation for this comes from the study of cuprate high temperature superconductors. However, we do not focus in great detail on the remarkable and exciting physics that has been discovered in these materials. Rather, we focus on the core theoretical issues associated with the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity. Although <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> theoretical issues in a strongly correlated superconductor are intended to be self contained and pedagogically complete, <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> experiments in the cuprates are, unfortunately, considerably more truncated and impressionistic. Our primary focus is on physics at intermediate temperature scales of order Tc (as well as the somewhat larger “pseudogap ” temperature) and energies of order the gap maximum, ∆ 0. Consequently (and reluctantly) we have omitted any detailed <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> a number of fascinating topics in cuprate superconductivity, including the low energy physics associated with nodal quasiparticles, the properties of the vortex matter which results from the application of a magnetic field, the effects of disorder, and a host of material specific issues.

60|$|Thus, {{to sum up}} <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> {{the value}} of philosophy; Philosophy is to be studied, not {{for the sake of}} any {{definite}} answers to its questions, since no definite answers can, as a rule, be known to be true, but rather {{for the sake of the}} questions themselves; because these questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich our intellectual imagination and diminish the dogmatic assurance which closes the mind against speculation; but above all because, through the greatness of the universe which philosophy contemplates, the mind also is rendered great, and becomes capable of that union with the universe which constitutes its highest good.|$|E

6000|$|Felix and Peter and I were {{required}} to help Uncle Roger in some carpentering work that day, and Felicity indulged {{in one of the}} house-cleaning orgies so dear to her soul; so that it was evening before we were all free to meet in the orchard and loll on the grasses of Uncle Stephen's Walk. In August it was a place of shady sweetness, fragrant with the odour of ripening apples, full of dear, delicate shadows. Through its openings we looked afar to the blue rims of the hills and over green, old, tranquil fields, lying the sunset glow. Overhead the lacing leaves made a green, murmurous roof. There {{was no such thing as}} hurry in the world, while we lingered there and talked of [...] "cabbages and kings."

6000|$|Here, for example, is a {{deliverance}} from Professor Metchnikoff, {{who was a}} very typical antagonist of all religion. He died {{only the}} other day. He was a very great physiologist indeed; {{he was a man}} almost of the rank and quality of Pasteur or Charles Darwin. A decade or more ago he wrote a book called [...] "The Nature of Man," [...] in which he set out very plainly a number of illuminating facts about life. They are facts so illuminating that presently, in <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> sin, they will be referred to again. But it is not Professor Metchnikoff's intention to provide material for a religious discussion. He sets out his facts in order to overthrow theology as he conceives it. The remarkable thing about his book, the thing upon which I would now lay stress, is that he betrays no inkling {{of the fact that he}} has no longer the right to conceive theology as he conceives it. The development of his science has destroyed that right.|$|E
60|$|We may now sum up <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> causality. We found {{first that}} the law of causality, as usually stated by philosophers, is false, and is not {{employed}} in science. We then considered the nature of scientific laws, and found that, instead of stating that one event A is always followed by another event B, they stated functional relations between certain events at certain times, which we called determinants, and other events at earlier or later times or at the same time. We were unable to find any a priori category involved: the existence of scientific laws appeared as a purely empirical fact, not necessarily universal, except in a trivial and scientifically useless form. We found that a system with one set of determinants may very likely have other sets of a quite different kind, that, for example, a mechanically determined system may also be teleologically or volitionally determined. Finally we considered the problem of free will: here {{we found that the}} reasons for supposing volitions to be determined are strong but not conclusive, and we decided that even if volitions are mechanically determined, that is no reason for denying freedom in the sense revealed by introspection, or for supposing that mechanical events are not determined by volitions. The problem of free will versus determinism is therefore, if we were right, mainly illusory, but in part not yet capable of being decisively solved.|$|E
30|$|Thus while <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> {{a digital}} {{pedagogy}} have made significant points in suggesting how radical shifts in approaches to {{and practices of}} learning might occur {{through the use of}} digital media, a further theoretical step is needed. This step entails understanding learning that involves the use of digital technologies and media not as a digital pedagogy, but as a digital material pedagogy. Such a perspective is particularly helpful when contemplating learning in unpredictable and dangerous environments, like construction or mining, as well as other industries where safety is a key concern for a range of reasons, such as the automotive industry, road safety generally and more.|$|R

Through <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> the ‘artistic freedom’ concept we demonstrate attitudes and needs of the Swedish Art community.

40|$|Interpersonal {{violence}} is a powerful expression of human social interaction. Yet a consideration {{of violence in the}} past has done relatively little to inform <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> the British Neolithic. Here, we present the results of an examination of some 350 earlier Neolithic crania from mainly southern Britain. Of these, 31 show healed or unhealed injuries suggestive of interpersonal violence. We suggest a conservative estimate of 2 % fatal cranial injuries, and 4 or 5 % healed injuries. These data are used as a platform to discuss possible contexts for, and consequences of, violence. We argue that, regardless of its actual prevalance, the reality or the threat of interpersonal violence can have an important affect on both the behaviour of individuals and the structure of society...|$|R
60|$|The thing-in-itself, when {{we start}} from {{common-sense}} assumptions, is a fairly natural outcome of the difficulties due to the changing appearances of what {{is supposed to be}} one object. It is supposed that the table (for example) causes our sense-data of sight and touch, but must, since these are altered by the point of view and the intervening medium, be quite different from the sense-data to which it gives rise. There is, in this theory, a tendency to a confusion from which it derives some of its plausibility, namely, the confusion between a sensation as a psychical occurrence and its object. A patch of colour, even if it only exists when it is seen, is still something quite different from the seeing of it: the seeing of it is mental, but the patch of colour is not. This confusion, however, can be avoided without our necessarily abandoning the theory we are examining. The objection to it, I think, lies in its failure to realise the radical nature of the reconstruction demanded by the difficulties to which it points. We cannot speak legitimately of changes in the point of view and the intervening medium until we have already constructed some world more stable than that of momentary sensation. <b>Our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the blue spectacles and the walk round the table has, I hope, made this clear. But what remains far from clear {{is the nature of the}} reconstruction required.|$|E
60|$|I do not myself {{believe that}} the {{analysis}} of knowledge can be effected entirely by means of purely external observation, such as behaviourists employ. I shall discuss this question in later lectures. In the present lecture I shall attempt the analysis of memory-knowledge, both as {{an introduction to the}} problem of knowledge in general, and because memory, in some form, is presupposed in almost all other knowledge. Sensation, we decided, is not a form of knowledge. It might, however, have been expected that we should begin <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> knowledge with PERCEPTION, i.e. with that integral experience of things in the environment, out of which sensation is extracted by psychological analysis. What is called perception differs from sensation {{by the fact that the}} sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates--images and expectations of their usual correlates--all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation. The FACT of past experience is essential in producing this filling-out of sensation, but not the RECOLLECTION of past experience. The non-sensational elements in perception can be wholly explained as the result of habit, produced by frequent correlations. Perception, according to our definition in Lecture VII, is no more a form of knowledge than sensation is, except in so far as it involves expectations. The purely psychological problems which it raises are not very difficult, though they have sometimes been rendered artificially obscure by unwillingness to admit the fallibility of the non-sensational elements of perception. On the other hand, memory raises many difficult and very important problems, which it is necessary to consider at the first possible moment.|$|E
60|$|On the whole, {{the flora}} {{agrees with the}} fauna in {{indicating}} a moderately remote origin, great isolation, and changes of conditions affording facilities for the introduction of organisms from {{various parts of the}} American coast, and even from the West Indian Islands and Gulf of Mexico. As {{in the case of the}} birds, the several islands differ considerably in their native plants, many species being limited to one or two islands only, while others extend to several. This is, of course, what might be expected on any theory of their origin; because, even if the whole of the islands had once been united and afterwards separated, long continued isolation would often lead to the differentiation of species, while the varied conditions to be found upon islands differing in size and altitude as well as in luxuriance of vegetation, would often lead to the extinction of a species on one island and its preservation on another. If the several islands had been equally well {290} explored, it might be interesting to see whether, as in the case of the Azores, the number of species diminished in those more remote from the coast; but unfortunately our knowledge of the productions of the various islands of the group is exceedingly unequal, and, except in those cases in which representative species inhabit distinct islands, we have no certainty on the subject. All the more interesting problems in geographical distribution, however, arise from the relation of the fauna and flora of the group as a whole to those of the surrounding continents, and we shall therefore for the most part confine ourselves to this aspect of the question in <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the phenomena presented by oceanic or continental islands.|$|E
40|$|Looking from a distance, as a {{condition}} of knowledge, participates within a long-standing Western tradition of power relations. This article considers the use of "distant reading" as theorized by Franco Moretti in his book by the same title and suggests that the method of literary analysis that uses such a metaphor should be aware and critical of that tradition. Moreover, this article suggests that we look to examples in literature, such as ekphrastic poetry by women for possible alternative approaches to reading at a distance as an approach to large corpora of text. Essentially, a feminist approach to distant reading is possible and necessary, and this paper calls for making such work more central to <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> distant reading by literary scholars...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In next {{generation}} network (NGN), end-to-end QoS {{is one of the}} critical issues for real-time multimedia communications and applications.
