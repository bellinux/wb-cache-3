40|$|SummaryIntroductionNon-invasive {{positive}} pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is {{an effective}} treatment in respiratory failure. Continuous positive pressure (CPAP) may also be useful in acute hypoxaemic patients. Supplementary oxygen is usually necessary in both systems. However, the inspired oxygen fraction (FiO 2) delivered by a NIV portable ventilator is unknown. The main objectives {{of this study were}} to establish the maximal FiO 2 that could be achieved by these devices and to analyse the FiO 2 determinant factors. MethodTen healthy volunteers were evaluated using a BiPAP ST 30 ventilator (Respironics, USA) with a single-limb circuit, expiratory port and nasal mask (Respironics, USA). Oxygen (15 L/min) was administered at two connection points (proximal and distal). Each volunteer carried out a NIPPV (inspiratory pressure 20 cmH 2 O [1. 95 kPa]—expiratory pressure 8 cmH 2 O [0. 78 kPa]) and a CPAP (10 cmH 2 O [0. 981 kPa]) session. FiO 2 was analysed by a probe located in the mask. Minute volume (MV) was measured using a pneumotachograph. ResultsMaximal FiO 2 was obtained with CPAP and distal <b>oxygen</b> <b>connection</b> point (67. 39 +/− 15. 39 %). NIPPV achieved higher MV than CPAP. FiO 2 was inversely correlated with MV. ConclusionsFiO 2 obtained while using a NIPPV portable ventilator depends on the ventilatory assistant mode, the <b>oxygen</b> <b>connection</b> point and the MV reached...|$|E

5000|$|British [...] "frogman's" [...] sets {{used the}} same shape of counterlung as the CDBA but {{different}} cylinders. One type was the [...] "Swimmer Canoeists Breathing Apparatus" [...] (SCBA), which had oxygen cylinders on the back, vertically for better streamlining in swimming, the <b>oxygen</b> <b>connections</b> thinner, and no cylinders on the front, leaving the diver's lower front uncluttered for climbing {{in and out of}} small boats. The SCBA gave 90 minutes dive duration with no reserve. In mixture (nitrox or heliox) mode it was called SCMBA. An old photograph seems to show the cylinders (and perhaps also the weights) in a tied or laced canvas casing rather than held on with metal clamps, and a rectangular fullface mask as with the CDBA. There is a British armed forces manual about the SCBA, dated 1984 as if the SCBA was still in use then, showing separate eyes-and-nose mask and strapped-in mouthpiece and no canvas pouch, and separate sport-type weight belt with buckle-shaped weights all at the back. The design of the Swimmer Canoeists Breathing Apparatus likely changed down the years.|$|R

40|$|To {{maintain}} arterial {{oxygen saturation}} (Sa,O 2) above 90 % in patients with acute respiratory failure, oxygen (O 2) is often added to the circuit of two-level noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). However, the final inspiratory oxygen fraction (Fi,O 2) is not known. To clarify this issue, the effect of different inspiratory positive airway pressures (IPAP) of the <b>oxygen</b> tubing <b>connection</b> site and the flow rate of O 2, on Fi,O 2 was assessed. The effects of the tidal volume (VT) and the respiratory rate on the Fi,O 2 were then clarified in a model study. The Fi,O 2 varied depending on the point where O 2 {{was added to the}} circuit. When all other variables were constant, the connection closest to the exhaust port (ventilator side) gave the highest Fi,O 2. Increases in IPAP led to decreases in Fi,O 2. Finally, Fi,O 2 increased with O 2 flow, although it was difficult to obtain an Fi,O 2 > 0. 30 unless very high O 2 flows were used. Paradoxically, NPPV with low IPAP values and without O 2 supplementation led to a Fi,O 2 12 cmH 2 O, oxygen flows should be at least 4 L x min(- 1) ...|$|R

Paradoxically, NPPV with low IPAP values and without O 2 supplementation led to a Fi,O 2 v 0. 21 at the circuit-patient interface. VT and respiratory rate did not appear to influence Fi,O 2. To conclude, when using noninvasive positive pressure ventilation with two-level respira-tors, oxygen should be added close to the exhaust port (ventilator side) of the circuit.

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is to remind {{proposals}} for welding processes classification in terms of oxygen in WMD (weld metal deposit), and confirmation of that concept after further 12 years of new research and results. Design/methodology/approach: Welds were obtained with various oxygen content. There were investigated properties of WMD, especially metallographic structure, toughness and fatigue strength of welds with various <b>oxygen</b> amount. The <b>connection</b> between the properties of welds with the content of oxygen in WMD were carried out. Findings: Demonstrated that oxygen content in WMD has an important influence on metallographic structure, especially on the percentage of acicular ferrite in weld. The preferred structure improves the mechanical properties of welded joints. Research limitations: The research results indicate that oxygen content in steel welds should be limited. Subsequent researchers could find more precisely the most beneficial oxygen amount in the welds in terms of the amount of acicular ferrite in welds. Practical limitations: To obtain welds with the best properties should be chosen suggested low-oxygen process. It is therefore suggestion to use much more basic electrodes than rutile for steel welding. Originality/value: Proposal of welding methods in terms of oxygen content in welds was given 12 years ago, however still it is not very popular. New researches and results could prove that it is very important and original proposal...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion of {{reinforcing}} bars {{is the major}} cause of deterioration of reinforced concrete (RC) structures in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and many coastal regions around the world. This deterioration leads {{to a loss of}} serviceability and functionality and ultimately affects the structural safety. The objective of this research is to formulate and implement a general stochastic finite element analysis (SFEA) framework for the time-dependent reliability analysis of RC beams with corroding flexural reinforcement. The framework is based on the integration of nonlinear finite element and reliability analyses through an iterative response surface methodology (RSM). Corrosion-induced damage is modelled through the combined effects of gradual loss of the cross-sectional area of the steel reinforcement and the reduction bond between steel and concrete for increasing levels of corrosion. Uncertainties in corrosion rate, material properties, and imposed actions are modelled as random variables. Effective implementation of the framework is achieved by the coupling of commercial finite element and reliability software. Application of the software is demonstrated through a case study of a simply-supported RC girder with tension reinforcement subjected to the effects of uniform (general) corrosion, in which two limit states are considered: (i) a deflection serviceability limit state and (ii) flexural strength ultimate limit state. The results of the case study show that general corrosion leads to a very significant decrease in the reliability of the RC beam both in terms of flexural strength and maximum deflections. The loss of strength and serviceability was shown to be predominantly caused by the loss of bond strength, whereas the gradual reduction of the cross-sectional area of tension reinforcement was found to be insignificant. The load-deflection response is also significantly affected by the deterioration of bond strength (flexural strength and stiffness). The probability of failure at the end of service life, due to the effects of uniform corrosion-induced degradation, is observed to be approximately an order of magnitude higher than in the absence of corrosion. Furthermore, the results suggest that flexural resistance of corroded RC beams is controlled by the anchorage (bond) of the bars and not by the yielding of fully bonded tensile reinforcement at failure. This is significant since the end regions can be severely corroded due to chloride, moisture, and <b>oxygen</b> access at <b>connections</b> and expansion joints. The research strongly suggests that bond damage must be considered in the assessment of the time-dependent reliability of RC beams subjected to general corrosion...|$|R
