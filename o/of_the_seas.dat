5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{potential}} for tropical cyclone development, Météo-France declared yellow cyclone alerts for Guadeloupe and Martinique, warning of imminent squally weather. Due {{to the presence of}} Emily, a state of emergency was declared for all of Puerto Rico. Officials ordered the preparation of over 400 storm shelters and ensured adequate water supply. The morning before the storm, government workers were dismissed, and national courtrooms remained closed. The United States Coast Guard issued a statement urging residents of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to avoid recreational boating and swimming until Emily had passed. JetBlue Airways waived fees for flights into the Dominican Republic because of the inclement weather conditions. Four cruise ships, Oasis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seas,</b> Freedom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seas,</b> Carnival Dream and Carnival Liberty altered their courses through the Caribbean to avoid the storm.|$|E
5|$|In Vietnam and Ghana, {{among other}} places, whales hold {{a sense of}} divinity. They are so {{respected}} in their cultures that they occasionally hold funerals for beached whales, a throwback to Vietnam's ancient sea-based Austro-Asiatic culture. The god <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seas,</b> according to Chinese folklore, was a large whale with human limbs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the expected increase in cargo traffic, the Port of Miami recently stated that October 2010 was its busiest October ever for cruise vacations. The port had a record 346,513 cruise passengers that October, up 29% from October 2009. This follows a record year in cruise traffic, with 4.15 million cruise passengers in the 12 months that ended in September. This is partially due {{to the arrival of}} new cruise ships such as the Norwegian Epic, as well as the cruise line Costa Cruises. Despite this, the Port of Miami has recently been losing cruise and cargo traffic to nearby Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale. In 2010, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, which is headquartered in Miami, chose Port Everglades as home for its new cruise ships, Oasis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seas</b> and Allure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seas,</b> currently the largest cruise ships in the world.|$|E

5|$|The dumping {{of waste}} (including oil, noxious liquids, sewage, and garbage) at sea {{is governed by}} {{international}} law.

5|$|The {{engagement}} was confusing {{for both}} sides, {{and the view}} was soon obscured by gunpowder smoke. Many ships on both sides were badly damaged, and around 2,000 men killed or wounded. Towards the end, a squadron of Danish ships met up with Dutch and escorted them into the harbor of Copenhagen. The Swedish fleet had failed; much-needed reinforcements and supplies had reached the beleaguered Danish town. The combined Danish and Dutch fleet now had control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seas,</b> forcing the Swedish fleet to seek refuge in the harbor of Landskrona on the Swedish mainland.|$|E

5|$|After {{having won}} control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seas,</b> a Roman force {{landed on the}} African coast under Marcus Regulus, who was at first victorious, winning the Battle of Adys and forcing Carthage to sue for peace. However, the terms of peace that Rome {{proposed}} were so heavy that negotiations failed, and in response, the Carthaginians hired Xanthippus of Carthage, a mercenary from the martial Greek city-state of Sparta, to reorganise and lead their army. Xanthippus managed {{to cut off the}} Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy and then defeated and captured Regulus at the Battle of Tunis.|$|E
5|$|By 1800, the British and French {{had been}} at war for seven years and the British {{dominated}} the sea, following {{a number of significant}} victories over the French, Dutch and Spanish fleets. Off every French port, large squadrons of British ships of the line and frigates awaited French movements and whenever possible intercepted and destroyed French merchant vessels and warships. While British trading ships travelled in large, well-armed convoys, French ships were forced to slip between harbours to avoid the British blockade. To counter British control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seas,</b> the French periodically despatched squadrons of ships to raid British trade lanes, particularly off West Africa and in the South Atlantic, where the stretched Royal Navy maintained only minimal forces.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{subsequent}} loss {{of much of}} Italy to the Lombards, the Byzantines maintained control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seas</b> around the peninsula. As the Lombards rarely ventured to sea, the Byzantines were able to retain several coastal strips of Italian territory for centuries. The only major naval action of the next 80 years occurred during the Siege of Constantinople by the Sassanid Persians, Avars and Slavs in 626. During that siege, the Slavs' fleet of monoxyla was intercepted by the Byzantine fleet and destroyed, denying the Persian army passage across the Bosporus and eventually forcing the Avars to retreat.|$|E

5|$|In {{line with}} his {{historical}} interests he initiated the erection of a statue for the murdered Grand Pensionary of Holland, Johan de Witt (1625–1672). The statue {{was designed and}} made by the Dutch sculptor Frederik Engel Jeltsema. The unveiling in The Hague on 12 June 1918 was a national event. The actual unveiling was done by Queen Wilhelmina, with several ministers in attendance. The statue stands close {{to the place where}} De Witt and his brother Cornelis were killed by a mob in 1672. On the side of the socle a text is engraved which – in translation – reads: 'Leader and servant of the Republic, designer of it most powerful fleets, defender of the freedom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seas,</b> caretaker of the State's coffers, mathematician. He was a perfect Dutchman.' Muller had an important hand in the formulation of the text.|$|E
5|$|In the War of the Third Coalition, 1803–1806, an {{alliance}} of Austria, Portugal, Russia, and others fought the First French Empire and its client states. Although several naval battles determined control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seas,</b> {{the outcome of the}} war was determined on the continent, predominantly in two major land operations. In the Ulm campaign, Klenau's force achieved the single Austrian victory prior to the surrender of the Austrian army in Swabia. In the second determining event, the decisive French victory at the Battle of Austerlitz over the combined Russian and Austrian force forced a final capitulation of the Austrian forces and took the Habsburgs out of the Coalition. This did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Prussian worries about growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806, in which Austria did not participate.|$|E

5|$|The port {{also serves}} as a {{passenger}} cruise ship terminal for cruise ships operating in the Caribbean. The terminal was home port to two Carnival Cruise Lines vessels, the Carnival Conquest and the Carnival Ecstasy. In November 2011 the company made Galveston home port to its 3,960-passenger mega-ships Carnival Magic and Carnival Triumph, as well. Carnival Magic sails a seven-day Caribbean cruise from Galveston, and it is the largest cruise ship based at the Port year-round. Galveston is the home port to Royal Caribbean International's, MS Liberty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seas,</b> which is the largest cruise ship ever based here and one of the largest ships in the world. In September 2012 Disney Cruise Line's Disney Magic also became based in Galveston, offering four-, six-, seven-, and eight-day cruises to the Caribbean and the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|The procellariids {{are present}} in all the world's oceans and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seas.</b> They are absent from the Bay of Bengal and Hudson Bay, but are present year round or {{seasonally}} in the rest. The seas north of New Zealand are the centre of procellariid biodiversity, with the most species. Among the four groups, the fulmarine petrels have a mostly polar distribution, with most species living around Antarctica and one, the northern fulmar ranging in the Northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The prions are restricted to the Southern Ocean, and the gadfly petrels are found mostly in the tropics with some temperate species. The shearwaters are the most widespread group and breed in most temperate and tropical seas, although by a biogeographical quirk are absent as breeders from the North Pacific.|$|E

5|$|Three cruise ships, Carnival Pride, Carnival Destiny, and Grandeur <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seas</b> had {{to alter}} their courses due to the {{presence}} of Bonnie. Due to the threat of a tropical storm, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal {{declared a state of emergency}} on July22. Along the Gulf Coast, concerns arose regarding the potential effects of the storm on the BP oil spill earlier in the year. Due to risk of intoxicated storm surge, authorities prepared for possible evacuations of low-lying areas along coastlines. On July23, Admiral Thad Allen ordered the oil spill site to be evacuated, as Bonnie posed a safety threat to nearly 2,000 people in that area. The ships and vessels in the area began preparation for evacuation on July24. Closer to shore, approximately 1,300 fishing boats laying boom had to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 18th century, with {{the lines between}} {{commercial}} and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts. The East India Company's control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seas,</b> greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to {{a portion of the}} Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies. Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s. India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials, and many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period. By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and effectively having been made an arm of British administration, the company began to more consciously enter non-economic arenas such as education, social reform, and culture.|$|E
