40|$|Graduation date: 1983 A set of 30 {{chemicals}} whose octanol-water {{partition coefficients}} (log P) are known were injected on a XAD- 2 column and a commercially available <b>octadecylsilane</b> column. Two types of mobile phase were {{used on the}} XAD- 2 column: buffered and unbuffered acetonitrile in water and buffered and unbuffered octanol-saturated water passing over an octanol coated resin. With <b>octadecylsilane</b> column, the mobile phase consisted only of acetonitrile in water. The capacity factors (k') from different column-mobile phase systems were compared. The ability of the column system to mimic the octanol-water shake-flask method was evaluated by plotting Δlog P versus Δlog k'. For each column system studied, good lines could be obtained for a homologous series of compounds, {{but not for the}} whole data set. In general, longer retention times were observed on the <b>octadecylsilane</b> column relative to the XAD- 2 column using the same mobile phase when compounds contain more polar or aliphatic character. The method and criterion to estimate the partition coefficients of organic compounds in traditional shake-flask systems by chromatographic techniques are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The linear {{relationship}} between electric {{resistance of the}} packed column for capillary electrochromatography and applied voltage was observed in several different effluents and packing materials (fluorinated-bonded silica and <b>octadecylsilane).</b> These {{linear relationship}}s had different slope values which depended on the charges {{on the surface of}} the stationary phase. If there are the negative charges on the stationary phase during the application of the electric field, the slope was negative value as observed in the fluorinated-bonded silica packed column. On the other hand, the slope was positive value in the fluorinated-bonded silica packed column using 0. 1 % tetrabutylammonium chloride as an effluent. The inclination of the linear relationship between the electric resistance and applied voltage also depended on the kind of the effluent, the concentration of effluent and the ratio of the organic modifier used.

40|$|Two {{different}} types of silica substrates uniformly modified with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) phases obtained with mono-, di- and trifunctional octadecylsilanes were subjected to artificial ageing under simulated routine conditions and were subsequently analysed and evaluated. Changes in {{the properties of the}} bonded phase packings were characterized and quantified with chromatographic techniques, solid-state NMR and elemental analysis. These changes were correlated with selectivity, loss of silanes, gain in silanol content and rearrange-ment of the silica to silane bonding. When eluents of extremely high pH were used, the multifunctional <b>octadecylsilane</b> stationary phases howed a higher resistance towards ligand stripping. The substrate shielding of difunctional octadecylsilanes howed superior characteristics due to direct surface attachments. The rigidity of the silica substrate used for modification influences the stability of the RP-HPLC phases, especially for the monofunctionally modified <b>octadecylsilane</b> stationary phase. With the use of multifunctional Cis silanes for modification, the influence of the characteristics of the substrate on the stability of the RP-HPLC phases was reduced compared with monofunctional C I 8. In contrast to monofunctionally modified phases, the polar selectivity of the multifunctionally modified phases remained more or less constant after intensive use with aggressive luents. A chromatographic characterization method for obtaining information about the stability, capacity, selectivity and silica degradation of different RP-HPLC stationary phases is also presented...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project {{was designed to}} investigate the surface chemistry of organosilanes at metal and oxide surfaces, specifically Ag, Au, SiO₂, and Al₂O₃. A combination of surface Raman spectroscopy, electrochemistry, scanning electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ellipsometry have been employed to study several important aspects of these films. Tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) and 1 -propanethiol are used as models to provide detailed vibrational assignments for (3 -mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (3 MPT). The vibrational assignments for 3 MPT are {{used to assess the}} conformational order of 3 MPT monolayers at Ag and Au surfaces before and after hydrolysis and condensation. Particular emphasis is given to the ν(Si-O), ν(C-H) modes, and the trans and gauche ν(C-S), ν(Si-C), and ν(C-C) modes in the frequency regions between ca. 500 to 1300 cm⁻¹ and ca. 2700 to 3000 cm⁻¹. The reactivity of the residual surface silanols and the wetting properties of the hydrolyzed 3 MPT result in the surface acting as a modifying agent for the attachment of thin dielectric layers such as SiO₂ on Ag and Au surfaces. Adhesion of the thin SiO₂ films to the metal surfaces are characterized using standard qualitative and quantitative adhesion tests. Raman spectra of molecular assemblies of <b>octadecylsilane</b> layers, a model of reversed-phase liquid chromatographic stationary phase materials, are acquired using a thin silica gel/ 3 MPT/Ag sandwich structure as the substrate. The Ag surface provides electromagnetic enhancement to the <b>octadecylsilane</b> overlayer. Spin coating a silica sol on the modified Ag surface results in the formation of a thin silica gel layer which contributes minimal fluorescence background to the Raman spectra. The spectra are interpreted in terms of the alkyl chain conformation on dry silica surfaces {{as well as in the}} presence of solvents commonly used in chromatography. The feasibility of acquiring Raman data from an Al/Al₂O₃ surface without an enhancing adlayer is demonstrated. Self-assembled films of <b>octadecylsilane,</b> octadecyldimethylsilane, and stearic acid were evaluated by Raman spectroscopy in terms of alkyl chain conformation. These data represent the first Raman spectra reported for alkylsilane layers on silica and Al₂O₃ surfaces without an enhancing adlayer and demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring conformational information from alkyl chains bound to oxide surfaces...|$|E

40|$|Two commercially {{available}} reversed phases for {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (one dimethyl-n-octadecylsilane phase and one di-isobutyl-n-octadecylsilane phase) and the native silica substrate were subjected to deuterium exchange in a mobile phase-like medium of acetonitrile and deuterium oxide (90 / 10, v/v). 29 Si cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning (CP MAS) NMR was used to obtain information on the amounts and relaxation behavior of the internal silanols of the silica substrate, and the residual silanols of the alkylsilane-derivatized phases. Consequences for the correlation of silanol 29 Si CP MAS NMR data and chromatography are discussed. Detection of deuterated silanol (SiOD) signals in 29 Si CP MAS NMR of deuterium-exchanged phases depends on a transfer of magnetization (cross-polarization) from silane protons to silanol silicon atoms. It is concluded that {{a large portion of}} the residual silanol NMR signal of the phases stems from internal silanols and from silanols that are spatially very close to an alkylsilane attachment site. The former are considered chromatographically irrelevant while the latter are assumed to be inaccessible for analytes during the chromatographic separation process for reasons of steric constraints. One bulky di-isobutyl-n-octadecylsilane is capable of cross-polarizing proton magnetization to 0. 8 residual surface silanols, whereas this is only 0. 3 for the conventional <b>octadecylsilane</b> with dimethyl side groups. However, the lower surface concentration of bulky alkylsilanes leaves more space for free, unhindered silanols. The most important factor determining the relaxation behavior of the residual silanol NMR signal is the mobility of the <b>octadecylsilane</b> side chains, bulky silanes having the larger mobility quenching effect on residual silanols...|$|E

The utilization of a diode-array UV detector allowed the quantitative analysis of betamethasone 17 -valerate together with its degradation product, betamethasone 21 -valerate, as well as the qualitative analysis of these compounds, relevant internal standards and the preservatives chlorocresol and methyl hydroxybenzoate contained in the cream and lotion formulations, respectively. Typically, cream and lotion dosage forms were dissolved in acetonitrile and ointments in tetrahydrofuran, internal standards added and aliquots injected onto the analytical system. Dosage form excipients were retained on the loop column and back-flushed to waste {{with the aid of a}} second solvent pump while components of interest were allowed to transfer to the analytical column for quantitative analysis. The method is accurate, precise and stability indicating and permits the rapid on-line analysis of betamethasone 17 -valerate from complex topical formulation matrices without prior extractions...|$|E
40|$|To {{simulate}} aging under chromatog. conditions, mono-, di-, and trifunctional octyl and octadecyl derivatized reversed-phase high-performance liq. chromatog. silicas {{were exposed}} to very aggressive mobile phases like the medium of 6 M NaOH in MeOH/H 2 O (50 / 50 vol. /vol.). 29 Si NMR was used to study the dissoln. characteristics of these phases by monitoring the concns. of the dissolving silane and silica structures. Dissoln. products of alkylchlorosilanes were used as model compds. for assignment purposes. Octadecyl phases appeared to degrade by dissoln. of the silica substrate; <b>octadecylsilane</b> structures were insol. under the exptl. conditions. Monofunctional octyl phases were shown to deteriorate through initial dissoln. of monomeric ligand silane particles, wheres for difunctional octyl phases, the silica backbone appeared to dissolve with the silane ligands still attached. The latter mechanism was also obsd. for the trifunctional octyl phases, but these phases resemble octadecyl phases, probably because the free ligand silane particles are almost insol. and the major cause of phase degrdn. is dissoln. of the silica substrat...|$|E
