5|$|UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and <b>Other</b> <b>Stuff</b> was {{released}} July 18, 1989. After it {{was released}}, the album peaked at number 146 on the Billboard 200. Much like Polka Party! (1986), {{the album was}} considered a major commercial disappointment for the comedian; the album is his second-lowest charting album after Polka Party! (1986). The UHF soundtrack {{is one of only}} a few of Yankovic's studio albums that is not certified either Gold or Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States. The others include Polka Party! and Poodle Hat (2003). UHF would also be Yankovic's last studio album to be released in the US on vinyl record until 2011's Alpocalypse.|$|E
25|$|When Charlotte {{calls for}} her minding, she finds Ambrose packing a {{suitcase}} for his father, rushed to hospital. He tells her than Arthur, whom she left sleeping soundly, {{had a heart}} attack later. With some embarrassment, Ambrose says that Arthur said strange things about her dancing naked, and <b>other</b> <b>stuff</b> he can't repeat. Ambrose talks about a close male friend in an old photograph Charlotte noticed, possibly implying Ambrose may be gay. As Charlotte departs, she leaves Ambrose a video.|$|E
25|$|Cali {{is governed}} by a mayor who is elected for a {{four-year}} term. Under the mayor, there are several administrative departments and secretaries. Mayor's elections started in 1986, followed by Governors' in 1992. Before these dates, all Colombian regional executive-branch leaders were appointed by the President himself. The first elected mayor was Carlos Holmes Trujillo of the Liberal Party. Unlike other Colombian cities, Cali has not properly adapted to the quite new Mayor's election system. The city has had some unsuccessful stories with some of its elected mayors, two of them being removed from office. Some argue this is caused by Aguablanca's huge mass population often driven to vote based in small short-termed gifts from populist candidates fully aware of this District needs. There were recorded cases of candidates giving bricks, cement and <b>other</b> <b>stuff</b> to the District's leaders in exchange for shifting votes to their campaigns.|$|E

25|$|Richie {{is able to}} {{secretly}} abstract JR's bone marrow, while setting JR up to look {{as though}} he was out all night with a hooker the day he went missing. A drugged-up JR, unaware that his bone marrow has been stolen, insists to his family and Babe that he was drugged and he knows Richie did this to him. Initially Krystal is the only one to believe JR, but Babe later finds out that JR is telling the truth about Richie and apologizes to him. She sees Richie pay the hooker that was with JR the night Richie stole his bone marrow. Babe punches out the hooker. She goes on a mission to find out what <b>other</b> <b>stuff</b> Richie has done to JR or anyone else. During this mission, JR saves Babe from being raped by some guys when she goes undercover as a prostitute to clear JR's name and find out what crimes Richie did. Trina decides to tell the truth about Richie and her part in framing JR when Richie stole his bone marrow.

500|$|Much like Yankovic's {{previous}} album, UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and <b>Other</b> <b>Stuff</b> {{features a}} polka medley of hit songs called [...] "The Hot Rocks Polka".

500|$|Yankovic also {{released}} a quasi-soundtrack {{for the film}} in late 1989, entitled UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and <b>Other</b> <b>Stuff,</b> which featured songs (and commercials) from the movie {{as well as new}} unrelated studio material from Yankovic. The album failed to be successful, charting at only 146 on the Billboard 200 and quickly falling off. After [...] the release of UHF, Yankovic returned to the studio to record his follow-up album.|$|E

500|$|UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and <b>Other</b> <b>Stuff</b> is {{the sixth}} studio album by [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic, {{released}} on July 18, 1989. The album {{is the final}} of Yankovic's to be produced by former The McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer. Recorded between December 1988 and May 1989, the album served as the official soundtrack to 1989 film of the same name, although the original score by John Du Prez is omitted. The album's lead single was the titular [...] "UHF", {{although it was not}} a hit and did not chart.|$|E
500|$|According to Furtado, in the studio, Timbaland {{had some}} beats that were [...] "already kind of halfway there; {{and then he}} had beats that he just had nucleuses of; and then <b>other</b> <b>stuff</b> we jammed together". While she was working with Timbaland and Danja in Miami, Pharrell Williams {{introduced}} Furtado to reggaeton, a musical genre that was unfamiliar to her. After he played a song for her, Furtado became inspired and wrote the lyrics to [...] "No Hay Igual" [...] "nearly on the spot". In an interview with MTV News, Furtado joked: [...] "Supposedly it was Pharrell's idea for me to work with Tim [...] Jimmy Iovine, the head of my record label , might beg to differ." ...|$|E
500|$|UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and <b>Other</b> <b>Stuff</b> is also notable {{in that it}} was Yankovic's {{first and}} only studio album to dabble in the art of skits. The first of these {{segments}} is called [...] "Gandhi II" [...] which re-imagines Mahatma Gandhi as the hero of a blaxploitation-style sequel to the film Gandhi, spoofing both the theme and promos for the film Shaft. The second skit is called [...] "Spatula City" [...] and is an advertisement for a spatula outlet store. These short segments were used in the film as commercials; other commercial segments, such as [...] "Plots 'R Us" [...] and [...] "Conan the Librarian", were not used on the album.|$|E

50|$|Thalía had commented in {{more than}} an {{occasion}} that her concert would be an entire show, with wardrobe, robotic lights, choreographies and <b>other</b> <b>stuffs.</b> But far from phenomenal productions like the most important world shows conceived by great artist of international fame as Madonna, Britney Spears, or Shakira, High Voltage Tour was a quite small, simple and basic show as for its stage and scene conception.|$|R
500|$|The {{story of}} Grand Theft Auto IV {{was written by}} Dan Houser and Rupert Humphries. Unlike {{previous}} Grand Theft Auto games which have a strong cultural or cinematic influence, [...] " [...] really have any cinematic influences", as explained by Houser. [...] "We were consciously trying to go, well, if video games are going to develop into the next stage, then the thing isn't {{to try and do}} a loving tribute or reference <b>other</b> <b>stuff.</b> It's to reference the actual place itself". Houser also said, [...] "In terms of the character, we wanted something that felt fresh and new and not something that was obviously derived from [...] movie. [...] Maybe [...] could do something ourselves that would live alongside that stuff".|$|E
500|$|Rick Ross drops by to say hi, {{keeping his}} {{appearance}} so brief that I can't {{help but wonder}} what he's even doing here. Justin Vernon inexplicably bookends the thing, pushing his falsetto into Antony range on the outro and muttering befuddling lyrics {{that have nothing to}} do with the rest of the song. All this over the straight-up funkiest beat Kanye West has made in years, a rippling electro push-pull that adds an effortless strut to his recent progged-out chilliness. But all that <b>other</b> <b>stuff</b> fades into the background when Nicki Minaj shows up. [...] She's a whirlwind of energy, showing her full repertoire of nutso voices and kicking the living fuck out of the beat, sounding like she's having an absolute blast the whole time." ...|$|E
500|$|... "As a goalie, I've {{never seen}} a guy be so focused and ready for a game," [...] Crawford said. [...] "I was kind of doing the {{opposite}} — being nonchalant and doing <b>other</b> <b>stuff</b> and not having a routine. You get in that physical routine that just makes you ready mentally. You trick yourself into knowing that it's game time and time to play." [...] Kyle Dubas, assistant GM of the Toronto Marlies cited Emery for his mentorship towards the team. On February 5, 2016, Emery signed with Adler Mannheim of the German elite league Deutsche Eishockey Liga {{for the remainder of}} the season, thus ending his professional tryout with the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League (AHL) On March 29, 2016, he signed a tryout contract with the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL) and on April 1, 2016, the Philadelphia Flyers announced signing Emery {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
60|$|The {{shop was}} a {{peculiar}} one. It had somewhat {{the aspect of}} an old curiosity shop, but the predominance of stuffed birds gave it a distinctly ornithological flavour. <b>Other</b> <b>stuffed</b> creatures were there, however, such as lizards, frogs, monkeys, etcetera, all of which straddled in attitudes more or less unlike nature, while a few wore expressions of astonishment quite in keeping with their circumstances.|$|R
