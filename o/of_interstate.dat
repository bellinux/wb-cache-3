5|$|MSHD {{had plans}} to upgrade the US16 {{corridor}} to freeway standards {{in the middle of}} the 20th century. The first planning map in 1947 for what later became the Interstate Highway System showed a highway in the corridor. The General Location of National System <b>of</b> <b>Interstate</b> Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955, or Yellow Book after the cover color, showed generalized plans for the locations <b>of</b> <b>Interstate</b> Highways as designated in 1955. This also included a highway in the US16 corridor. The 1957 approval for the Interstate Highway System replaced much of US16 with a portion <b>of</b> <b>Interstate</b> 94 (I-94). MSHD submitted a recommended numbering plan for the Interstates in 1958 that showed I-96 following the US16 corridor.|$|E
