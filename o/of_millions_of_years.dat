5|$|Carbon may burn vigorously and brightly in the {{presence}} of air at high temperatures. Large accumulations of coal, which have remained inert for hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> in the absence of oxygen, may spontaneously combust when exposed to air in coal mine waste tips, ship cargo holds and coal bunkers, and storage dumps.|$|E
5|$|The asteroids are not {{samples of}} the {{primordial}} Solar System. They have undergone considerable evolution since their formation, including internal heating (in the first few tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years),</b> surface melting from impacts, space weathering from radiation, and bombardment by micrometeorites. Although some scientists refer to the asteroids as residual planetesimals, other scientists consider them distinct.|$|E

40|$|On Earth, carbon {{cycles through}} the land, ocean, atmosphere, living and dead biomass and the planet’s interior. The global carbon cycle {{can be divided}} into the tectonically driven {{geological}} cycle and the biological/physicochemical cycles. The former operates over <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> whereas the latter operate over much shorter time scales (days to thousands <b>of</b> <b>years).</b> Within the geological cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is controlled by the balance between weathering, biological drawdown, size of sedimentary reservoir, subduction, metamorphism and volcanism over time periods <b>of</b> hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>year...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{concentration}} of maria on the Near Side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the Far Side, {{which may have}} formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of Earth a few tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> after their formation.|$|E
5|$|All rock now {{exposed in}} the area of the park is volcanic, but this has not always been the case. For {{hundreds}} <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> the Lassen region underwent repeated uplifting to form mountains, only to have them worn down and submerged under encroaching seas. During the periods of submersion, sand, mud and limestone were deposited. Occasionally volcanic activity was associated with the mountain building.|$|E
5|$|Continents formed, {{then broke}} up and {{reformed}} as {{the surface of}} Earth reshaped over hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> occasionally combining to make a supercontinent. Roughly 750million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about 540million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180million years ago.|$|E

Although most filovirus-like EVEs appear to be pseudogenes, evolutionary analyses suggest that orthologs isolated from several species of the bat genus Myotis have been maintained by selection.|$|R
50|$|When {{the book}} was written, {{the nature of the}} energy source that powers stars was not known: Lord Kelvin had {{published}} calculations based on the hypothesis that the energy came from the gravitational collapse of the gas cloud that had formed the sun and found that this mechanism gave the Sun a lifetime of only a few tens <b>of</b> <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> Starting from this premise, Hodgson wrote a novel describing a time, <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> in the future, when the Sun has gone dark.|$|R
5|$|Mauna Loa has {{probably}} been erupting for at least 700,000years, and may have emerged above sea level about 400,000years ago. The oldest-known dated rocks are not older than 200,000years. The volcano's magma comes from the Hawaii hotspot, which {{has been responsible for}} the creation of the Hawaiian island chain over tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> The slow drift of the Pacific Plate will eventually carry Mauna Loa away from the hotspot within 500,000 to one million years from now, at which point it will become extinct.|$|E
5|$|The geology of the Lassen {{volcanic}} area presents {{a record of}} sedimentation and volcanic activity {{in the area in}} and around Lassen Volcanic National Park in Northern California, U.S. The park is located in the southernmost part of the Cascade Mountain Range in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Pacific Oceanic tectonic plates have plunged below the North American Plate in this part of North America for hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> Heat from these subducting plates has fed scores of volcanoes in California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia over at least the past 30 million years (see Geology of the Pacific Northwest) and is also responsible for activities in the Lassen {{volcanic area}}.|$|E
5|$|The oligarch {{theory of}} planet {{formation}} states {{that there were}} hundreds of planet-sized objects, known as oligarchs, {{in the early stages of}} the Solar System's evolution. In 2005, astronomer Eugene Chiang speculated that although some of these oligarchs became the planets we know today, most would have been flung outward by gravitational interactions. Some may have escaped the Solar System altogether to become free-floating planets, whereas others would be orbiting in a halo around the Solar System, with orbital periods <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> This halo would lie at between 1,000 and 10,000AU from the Sun, or between a third and a thirtieth the distance to the Oort cloud.|$|E
50|$|Symbiosis with {{bacteria}} - As all aphididae, A. pisum {{hosts the}} primary endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola, which provides {{essential amino acids}} and is necessary for aphid reproduction. Buchnera is transmitted from mothers to offspring, and it has coevolved with aphids for dozens <b>of</b> <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> A. pisum also hosts a range of facultative bacterial symbionts that can be transmitted maternally and horizontally, and which affect ecologically important traits in aphids, such as body color, resistance to abiotic and biotic stress, and nutrition.|$|R

5|$|The {{red panda}} is {{considered}} a living fossil and only distantly related to the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), as it is naturally {{more closely related to}} {{the other members of the}} superfamily Musteloidea to which it belongs. The common ancestor of both pandas (which also was an ancestor for all living bears; pinnipeds like seals and walruses; and members of the family Musteloidea like weasels and otters) can be traced back to the Early Tertiary period tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> ago, with a wide distribution across Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|Despite its urban character, the San Francisco Bay {{is one of}} California's most ecologically {{important}} habitats, providing key {{ecosystem services}} such as filtering pollutants and sediments from the rivers, and supporting a number of endangered species. The region is also known for the complexity of its landforms, the result <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> of tectonic plate movements. Because the Bay Area is crossed by six major earthquake faults, the region is particularly exposed to hazards presented by large earthquakes. The climate is temperate and generally very mild, and is ideal for outdoor recreational and athletic activities such as hiking. The Bay Area is host to seven professional sports teams and is a cultural center for music, theater, and the arts. It is also host to several institutions of higher education, ranging from primary schools to major research universities. Home to 101 municipalities and nine counties, governance in the Bay Area is mutlifaceted and involves numerous local and regional actors, each with wide-ranging and overlapping responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, {{allowing}} elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed magma oceans. However, because of the relatively small size of the bodies, the period of melting was necessarily brief (compared to the much larger planets), and had generally ended about 4.5billion years ago, in the first tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> of formation. In August 2007, a study of zircon crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have originated from 4 Vesta suggested that it, and by extension the rest of the asteroid belt, had formed rather quickly, within ten million years of the Solar System's origin.|$|E
50|$|Ardrey {{postulated}} that precursors <b>of</b> Australopithecus survived <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> drought in the Miocene and Pliocene epochs, as the savannah spread and the forests shrank, by adapting the hunting ways of carnivorous species. Changes in survival techniques and social organization gradually differentiated pre-humans from other primates. Concomitant changes in diet potentiated unique {{developments in the}} human brain.|$|R

5|$|The Bay Area is {{well known}} for the {{complexity}} of its landforms that are the result <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> by the forces of plate tectonics, since the region is located {{in the middle of a}} meeting point between two plates. Nine out of eleven distinct assemblages have been identified in a single county, Alameda. Diverse assemblages adjoin in complex arrangements due to offsets along the many faults (both active and stable) in the area. As a consequence, many types of rock and soil are found in the region. The oldest rocks are metamorphic rocks that are associated with granite in the Salinian Block west of the San Andreas fault. These were formed from sedimentary rocks of sandstone, limestone, and shale in uplifted seabeds. Volcanic deposits also exist in the Bay Area, left behind by the movement of the San Andreas fault, whose movement sliced a subduction plate and allowed magma to briefly flow to the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{species is}} P. lujiatunensis, {{found in the}} lowest beds of the Yixian Formation. Over 200 specimens attributed to this genus have been recovered from these and other beds of the Yixian, the age {{of which is the}} subject of much debate. Although many early studies using radiometric dating put the Yixian in the Jurassic Period, tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> outside of the expected temporal range of Psittacosaurus, most recent work dates it to the Early Cretaceous. Using argon-argon dating, a team of Chinese scientists dated the lowest beds in the formation to about 128mya, and the highest to approximately 122mya. A more recent Chinese study, using uranium-lead dating, suggests that the lower beds are younger, approximately 123.2mya, while agreeing with an age of 122mya for the upper beds.|$|E
5|$|The {{islands of}} Japan {{are located in}} a {{volcanic}} zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire. They are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene {{as a result of}} the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa Plate to the south, and subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate to the north. The Boso Triple Junction off the coast of Japan is a triple junction where the North American Plate, the Pacific Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate meets. Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent. The subducting plates pulled Japan eastward, opening the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|Total solar eclipses {{are seen}} on Earth {{because of a}} fortuitous {{combination}} of circumstances. Even on Earth, the diversity of eclipses familiar to people today is a temporary (on a geological time scale) phenomenon. Hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> in the past, the Moon was closer to the Earth and therefore apparently larger, so every solar eclipse was total {{and there were no}} annular eclipses. Due to tidal acceleration, the orbit of the Moon around the Earth becomes approximately 3.8cm more distant each year. Millions of years in the future, the Moon will be too far away to fully occlude the Sun, and no total eclipses will occur. In the same timeframe, the Sun may become brighter, making it appear larger in size. Estimates of the when the moon will be unable to occlude the entire sun when viewed from the Earth range between 1.4 billion and 650 million years in the future.|$|E

5|$|Oxygen isotope ratios in fossilized bone are {{sometimes}} {{used to determine}} the temperature at which the bone was deposited, as the ratio between certain isotopes correlates with temperature. In one specimen, the isotope ratios in bones from different parts of the body indicated a temperature difference of no more than 4 to 5°C (7 to 9°F) between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg. This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that Tyrannosaurus rex maintained a constant internal body temperature (homeothermy) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals. Other scientists have pointed out that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the fossils today does not necessarily represent the same ratio in the distant past, and may have been altered during or after fossilization (diagenesis). Barrick and Showers have defended their conclusions in subsequent papers, finding similar results in another theropod dinosaur from a different continent and tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> earlier in time (Giganotosaurus). Ornithischian dinosaurs also showed evidence of homeothermy, while varanid lizards from the same formation did not. Even if Tyrannosaurus rex does exhibit evidence of homeothermy, it {{does not necessarily mean that}} it was endothermic. Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy, as in some living sea turtles.|$|E
