40|$|International audienceThis paper {{summarizes}} {{our recent}} {{work on the}} development of thermal anemometry to measure velocity and temperature fluctuations in <b>oscillating</b> <b>flows.</b> First, we demonstrate that velocity cannot be measured accurately by hot-wire anemometry in <b>oscillating</b> <b>flows</b> when the flow reverses its direction. Indeed, there is no unique and well-defined correlation between the flow velocity and heat transfer near flow reversal, which prevents the recovery of velocity fluctuations from the anemometer signal. Second, we detail new procedures for the measurement of temperature fluctuations in <b>oscillating</b> <b>flows</b> using cold-wire thermometry. Thermal inertia alters the response of the sensor to temperature changes. The thermal inertia of the cold-wire (operated by a constant-current or a constant-voltage anemometer) is corrected instantaneously using the same wire but in the heated mode (operated by a constant-voltage anemometer). The new procedures are validated in an acoustic standing-wave where temperature fluctuations amplitudes lower than 0. 2 K at approximately 1000 Hz are successfully measured. Experiments near the edges of the stack in a thermoacoustic refrigerator demonstrate the nonlinearity of the temperature field...|$|R

This kind of flow has effects on the formation of vortex shedding behind bluff bodies. In this paper the flow around a circular cylinder was numerically simulated. The effects of frequency variation at inlet flow on the vortex shedding frequency were investigated. The transient Two-Dimensional Navier-Stokes equations were employed to compute the unsteady laminar free stream flow over a circular cylinder. A time series of analysis for the formations of vortex shedding behind the circular cylinder were performed under uniform (Frequency= 0) and <b>oscillated</b> <b>flows</b> (Frequency= 0. 1, 1, 10, 60 and 100 Hz) at Re= 300.

40|$|International audienceA new {{procedure}} for the instantaneous correction of the thermal inertia of cold wires {{operated by a}} constant-current anemometer is proposed for <b>oscillating</b> <b>flows.</b> The thermal inertia of cold wires depends both on the wire properties and on the instantaneous incident flow velocity. Its correction is challenging in <b>oscillating</b> <b>flows</b> because no relationship between flow velocity and heat transfer around the wire is available near flow reversal. The present correction procedure requires neither calibration data for velocity nor thermophysical or geometrical properties of the wires. The method relies on the splitting of the time lag of cold wires into two factors, which are obtained using a constant-voltage anemometer in the heated mode. The first factor, which is intrinsic to the wire, is deduced from time-constant measurements performed in a low-turbulence flow. The second factor, which depends on the instantaneous flow velocity, is acquired in situ. In <b>oscillating</b> <b>flows,</b> data acquisition can be synchronized with a reference signal so that the same wire is alternatively operated in the cold mode by a constant-current anemometer and in the heated mode by a constant-voltage anemometer. Validation experiments are conducted in an acoustic standing-wave resonator, for which the fluctuating temperature field along the resonator axis is known independently from acoustic pressure measurements, so that comparisons {{can be made with}} cold-wire measurements. It is shown that {{despite the fact that the}} wire experiences flow reversal, the new procedure recovers accurately the instantaneous temperature of the flow...|$|R

40|$|Unsteady laminar {{convective}} {{fluid flow}} and heat transfer past two cylinders in tandem arrangement is investigated. Besides forced mixing {{by the natural}} vortex streets, extra imposed oscillating inlet velocity are considered. The lift and drag coefficients and Strouhal number for a single cylinder and their dependence on Reynolds number are also provided to validate the calculations with previous experiments. Different frequencies and amplitudes of the <b>oscillating</b> <b>flows</b> are set as inlet boundary conditions. For the cycle effect, at some specified points of the cycle ratios, the heat transfer enhancement of the upstream cylinder and the downstream cylinder are relatively larger due to the combined-effect of the natural vortex streets and the imposed <b>oscillating</b> inlet <b>flows.</b> The interaction between the natural vortex streets and imposed <b>oscillating</b> inlet <b>flow</b> leads to non-regular shaped vortices with increased flow mixing. For the amplitude effect, Nusselt numbers of the two cylinders are both greatly increased with increased amplitude ratios.

40|$|Free {{convection}} from {{a heated}} oscillating circular cylinder is studied numerically under {{the conditions of}} a constant heat flux on the cylinder surface and a constant temperature at far-away. The initial conditions of flow and temperature are those of a free convection flow without the cylinder oscillations.
