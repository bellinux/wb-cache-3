5000|$|Nissan's SR16VE engine {{found in}} Nissan Pulsar VZ-R and VZ-R N1 is an <b>oversquare</b> <b>engine</b> with 86 mm bore and 68.7 mm stroke, giving it an {{impressive}} 175-200 hp but relatively small torque of 119 lb.ft-134 lb.ft ...|$|E
50|$|The M102 {{engine family}} was a straight-4 {{gasoline}} automobile engine from Mercedes-Benz in the 1980s and early 1990s. It {{is a relatively}} <b>oversquare</b> <b>engine</b> with a large bore and short stroke. Compare to the M115 engine which was used {{during the same time}} frame.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Oversquare</b> <b>engines</b> (a.k.a. [...] "short stroke engines") {{are very}} common, as they allow higher rpm (and thus more power), without {{excessive}} piston speed.|$|R
50|$|The reduced {{stroke length}} {{allows for a}} shorter {{cylinder}} and sometimes a shorter connecting rod, generally making <b>oversquare</b> <b>engines</b> less tall but wider than undersquare engines of similar engine displacement.|$|R
50|$|Extreme <b>oversquare</b> <b>engines</b> {{are found}} in Formula One racing cars, where strict rules limit displacement, thereby necessitating that power be {{achieved}} through high engine speeds. Stroke ratios approaching 2.5:1 are allowed, enabling engine speeds of 18,000 RPM while remaining reliable for multiple races.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "square engine" [...] is {{an engine}} with a bore {{diameter}} equal to its stroke length. An engine where the bore diameter {{is larger than}} its stroke length is an <b>oversquare</b> <b>engine,</b> conversely, an engine with a bore diameter that is smaller than its stroke length is an undersquare engine.|$|E
50|$|The final {{resurgence}} of the original Bugatti was the Type 251, completed in 1955. Designed by Gioacchino Colombo of Ferrari fame, it was powered by a new 2.5 L (2486 cc/151 in³) straight-8. Uniquely, this engine was mounted transversely, behind the driver. For {{the first time in}} a Bugatti, an <b>oversquare</b> <b>engine</b> was used with a 76 mm bore and 68.5 mm stroke. A de Dion tube rear suspension was also a novelty for the company, though it was in vogue at the time. The Type 251 was entered in the 1956 French Grand Prix, driven by Maurice Trintignant, but was not competitive and retired after 18 laps.|$|E
50|$|The DragStar {{began as}} the XVS650 in 1997 in Europe (400 version {{available}} in Japan since 1996), and grew in 1999 {{to include the}} XVS1100 Custom. The 1100 used a reworked version of the venerable Virago 75-degree, air-cooled v-twin engine which had been in use since the early 1980s. The Star version offered better torque for the new midsize cruiser bike. The Star carried over the shaft-drive layout from the Virago, but relied on a new suspension and frame, discarding the outboard dual shocks and stressed-member engine arrangement of the Virago {{in favor of a}} single-shock and twin downtubes. Dual Mikuni 37 mm carburetors with throttle-position sensors are used to efficiently meter fuel to the 8.3:1, <b>oversquare</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Horizontally opposed, {{also known}} as [...] "Boxer" [...] or [...] "flat", <b>engines</b> {{typically}} feature <b>oversquare</b> designs since any increase in stroke length would result in twice the increase in overall engine width. This is particularly so in Subaru's front-engine layout, where the steering angle of the front wheels is constrained by {{the width of the}} <b>engine.</b> Although <b>oversquare</b> <b>engines</b> have a reputation for being high-strung, [...] low-torque machines, the Subaru EJ181 engine develops peak torque at speeds as low as 3200 rpm.|$|R
50|$|The 225 {{used the}} RG (tall) block with a 3.40 in bore, a 4.125 in stroke, and 6.699 in {{connecting}} rods, for an actual displacement of 224.7 cuin L. This undersquare geometry was {{a departure from}} the emerging trend towards <b>oversquare</b> <b>engines.</b> It provided strong low-rpm torque characteristics for automobiles and trucks, as well as other commercial and marine applications. The 225 was originally designed and introduced in 1960 for use in full-size models, and it eventually became the best known of the Slant Six engines.|$|R
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: Square, <b>oversquare</b> and undersquare <b>engines</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|An <b>oversquare</b> <b>engine</b> {{allows for}} more and larger valves in {{the head of the}} cylinder, higher {{possible}} RPM by lowering maximum piston ring speed and lower crank stress due to the lower peak piston acceleration for the same engine speed. Due to the increased piston and head surface area, the heat loss increases as the bore/stroke ratio is increased. Thus an excessively high ratio can lead to a decreased thermal efficiency compared to other engine geometries. Because these characteristics favor higher engine speeds, oversquare engines are often tuned to develop peak torque at a relatively high speed. The large size/width of the combustion chamber at ignition can cause increased inhomogeneity in the air/fuel mixture during combustion, resulting in higher emissions.|$|E
5000|$|Undersquare {{engines are}} {{typically}} tuned to exhibit peak torque at lower RPM than an <b>oversquare</b> <b>engine</b> {{due to their}} longer crank throw and high piston speed at high RPM. While the surface area of the cylinder in an undersquare engine may be {{higher than that of}} a square engine cylinder, heat exchange through the cylinder wall is lessened compared to heat exchange through the cylinder head and piston since the cylinder wall is not in constant contact with the expanding gasses. Since each unit of area of cylinder wall permits less heat loss to the engine than through the cylinder head or piston, undersquare engines generally exhibit improved thermal efficiency compared to oversquare engines. For these reasons, diesel truck engines which require low RPM torque and high thermal efficiency more than high power density most commonly adopt an undersquare engine geometry.|$|E
5000|$|The Humber was also, at launch, {{fitted with}} a high tune version of the 1,592 cc and, from September 1965, 1,725 cc <b>oversquare</b> <b>engine</b> {{producing}} [...] and [...] respectively. Early models with the 1,592 cc engine had twin single Zenith downdraught carburettors - later 1,592/1,725 cc engines used a Solex twin choke downdraught carburettor for simplicity. The twin Zenith carburettors had been hard to keep balanced. Other modifications included a water-jacketed inlet manifold, timing adjustments and stronger valve springs to eliminate valve bounce at high engine speeds. The later H120's [...] engine is a straight swap for both of these units and looks almost identical - it provides a useful boost in power to an already swift automobile. The unique Sceptre interior featured full instrumentation, including a tachometer marked up to 6,000 rpm, and a four-speed floor-mounted transmission with self-cancelling overdrive (with column-mounted control and indicator) on third and fourth gear {{for a total of}} six separate ratios in standard form. The lockout could be removed on first and second gears, and this was often done by Rootes in cars used for competitions such as rallying. In addition, the Sceptre was from the beginning provided with servo-assisted braking control and, unusually in 1963, 10-inch front disc-brakes. The Marks 1 and 1A were not available with an automatic option - although this was rectified with the Mark II cars, using a three-speed unit with automatic kick-down. This was a cheaper option than was usual at the time due to the deletion of the Laycock De Normanville overdrive fitted to the Manual cars.|$|E
50|$|The 1071 cc {{version was}} another one-off, {{this time for}} the Mini Cooper S. It used a new 70.6 mm bore size and the 68.26 mm stroke from the 848. It was only {{produced}} in 1963-1964. Paired with the even rarer 970 cc version, below, it became that rarest of things: an <b>oversquare</b> A-series <b>engine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 500 F2 car was {{reworked}} in late 1953 {{to become}} Ferrari's 1954 entrant in Formula One. The engine was bored and stroked to 100 mm (3.9 in) by 79.5 mm (3.1 in) {{for a total}} of 2498 cc of displacement. The F1 car, with 13.1:1 compression and two Weber 50DCOA3 carbs, pumped 260 hp (194 kW) from this powerplant. The <b>oversquare</b> 200 F2 <b>engine</b> reappeared again in the 1955 555 F1.|$|R
50|$|A 2155 cc L {{version was}} also built. It {{was first used}} in the Talbot Tagora. Bore was 91.7 mm (3.61 in) and stroke was 81.6 mm (3.21 in) making a very <b>oversquare</b> design. This <b>engine</b> is {{sometimes}} confused with the 2,165 cc Renault/Peugeot Douvrin engine, but the displacement of the Simca 180 2.2-litre was slightly less. Later, this engine was also turbocharged, {{for use in the}} Citroën BX4TC and Peugeot 505 Turbos as the block was stronger than the Peugeot engine.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{iteration}} of the W-series {{engine was}} the 1958 [...] "Turbo-Thrust" [...] 348 CID L, originally {{intended for use}} in Chevrolet trucks but also introduced in the larger, heavier 1958 passenger car line. Bore was 4.125 in and stroke was 3.25 in, resulting in a substantially <b>oversquare</b> design. This <b>engine</b> was superseded by the 409-cubic-inch as Chevrolet's top performing engine in 1961 and went out of production for cars {{at the end of}} that year. It was produced through 1964 for use in large Chevrolet trucks.|$|R
5000|$|The {{model changes}} in early 1972 {{included}} {{the introduction of}} a top-of-the-line 2300 Sport SL model (introduced at the Geneva Motor Show), using the 2279 cc engine. The 2300 Sport SL was the only version to feature the seven dial dash (speedometer, clock, rev counter, fuel, oil pressure, water temp, & battery charge). The engine was an inclined four-cylinder with single overhead camshaft and twin Stromberg carburettors, producing [...] The <b>oversquare</b> straight four <b>engine</b> was renowned for its big torque curve, making the car very flexible and easy to drive. The interior was equipped with bucket seats, front and back, to carry four persons. The centre console with heater controls and warning lights was quite distinctive and luxurious for the time.|$|R
50|$|The {{rules for}} the class {{required}} the cars to be powered by production-based engines with a volume of 1000 cc with a 360 kg (792 lb) car or 1100 cc with a 400 kg (880 lb) car - in practice the latter was used in almost all successful FJs (the USA adopted other cc/weight ratios but they were rarely used). Parts like engine block, head and cylinders had {{to come from a}} production car; single or twin overhead camshafts, limited slip differentials and modifications to the number of main bearings were all forbidden. The brakes and transmission also had to be production-based. Constructors were allowed {{to increase the number of}} gears, but only inside a production gearbox casing. Formula Junior was also the first racing class to require roll cages. In Italy the popular Fiat 1100 engine was the obvious choice and in 1958 there were few other suitable engines in Italy; elsewhere the 1000 cc Mini engine as well as the DKW and the Saab three-cylinder two-stroke engines were obvious choices, as was the new <b>oversquare</b> Ford <b>engine</b> from the 105E Anglia. The first Italian FJ cars were very much in the front-engined tradition of contemporary Grand Prix cars; the first international Formula Junior championship in 1959 was won by the Swiss driver and engineer Michael May in an Automobili Stanguellini. The British constructors were initially not particularly interested; the 500cc Formula Three was still just about viable, and small-capacity sports car racing had become the accepted route into racing. As the formula gathered momentum, though, constructors started to take note.|$|R
50|$|The mean of any {{function}} {{refers to}} the average value. In the case of mean piston speed, taken in a narrow mathematical sense, it is zero because half {{of the time the}} piston is moving up and half of the time the piston is moving down; this is not useful. The way the term is usually used is to describe the distance traveled by the piston per unit of time, taking distance positive in both up and down senses. It is related to the rate that friction work is done on the cylinder walls, and thus the rate that heat generated there.This is sort of a non-puzzle. It represents a specification to be designed to rather than as a result of. I'm not an ME but I have built many engines of various types over the years and the mean piston velocity {{is a function of the}} revolutions per minute, that is, the piston at a specific rpm is going to be the same at the peak of the graph as it is at the trough, that is at 286.071 degrees on the crankshaft if the rpm is held consistent. At 0 and 180 degrees, the piston velocity is zero.Piston velocity is a test of the strength of the piston and connecting rod subassembly. The alloy used to make the piston itself is what determines the maximum velocity that the piston can reach before friction coefficients, heat levels and reciprocating stress overcome the maximum levels that the piston can sustain before it begins to fail structurally. As the alloy tends to be fairly consistent across most manufacturers, the maximum velocity of the piston at a given rpm is determined by the length of the stroke, that is, the radius of the journal of the crankshaft.The most common engine types in production are built to square, or below square. That is, a square engine has the same diameter of cylinder bore as the total length of the stroke from 0 to 180 degrees, whereas in an undersquare engine, the total length of the stroke is less than the diameter of the bore. The latter is mostly used in higher performance engines where the torque curve approaches the peak of the maximum piston velocity. Generally in this type of engine, the volume of the cylinder can be artificially enhanced with turbochargers or superchargers, increasing the amount of fuel/air available for combustion.An example is found in Formula 1 racing engines, where the cylinder diameter is substantially greater than the length of the stroke, resulting in higher available rpm but necessitating greater requirements of the strengths of connecting rods and pistons and higher temperature tolerances for bearings. The cylinder diameter in these engines are fairly small (under 45 mm) and the stroke is less than that, depending on the torque curve and maximum available rpm as designed by the builder. Peak torque is reached at higher rpm and is spread over a wider range of rpm. The specifications of these are known factors and can be designed to.Torque is a function of the length of the stroke, the shorter the stroke, the less available torque at lower rpm, but the piston velocity can be taken to much greater speeds, meaning higher engine rpm. These types of engines are much more delicate and require a much higher level of precision in the moving parts than square or <b>oversquare</b> <b>engines.</b> Up until the early 1960s, the focus by designers was on torque rather than piston velocity, probably due to material considerations and machining technologies. As materials have improved, engine rpm has increased.|$|R
