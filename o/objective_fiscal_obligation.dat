25|$|Contrary to a stockbroker, a {{professional}} who arranges transactions between a buyer and a seller, {{and gets a}} guaranteed commission for every deal executed, {{a professional}} trader may have a steep learning curve and his/her ultra-competitive performance based career may be cut short, especially during generalized stock market crashes. Stock market trading operations have a considerably high level of risk, uncertainty and complexity, especially for unwise and inexperienced stock traders/investors seeking {{an easy way to}} make money quickly. In addition, trading activities are not free. Stock speculators/investors face several costs such as commissions, taxes and fees to be paid for the brokerage and other services, like the buying/selling orders placed at the stock exchange. Depending on the nature of each national or state legislation involved, a large array of <b>fiscal</b> <b>obligations</b> must be respected, and taxes are charged by jurisdictions over those transactions, dividends and capital gains that fall within their scope. However, these <b>fiscal</b> <b>obligations</b> will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Among other reasons, there could be some instances where taxation is already incorporated into the stock price through the differing legislation that companies have to comply with in their respective jurisdictions; or that tax free stock market operations are useful to boost economic growth. Beyond these costs are the opportunity costs of money and time, currency risk, financial risk, and Internet, data and news agency services and electricity consumption expenses—all of which must be accounted for.|$|R

The public finances deteriorated in 2002, reflecting a combination of expenditure overruns and a drop in non-oil revenue collection.

40|$|Fiscal {{relations}} between the German Lander and its communities are characterised by vertical transfers from the Lander to their municipalities. Traditionally the system is discussed vigorously as it serves allocative, redistributive and <b>fiscal</b> <b>objectives</b> {{at the same time}} which are at least partly in conflict. Recently additional criticism has been put forward, because theoretical analysis suggested regressive effects of the "Schlusselzuweisungen". They are the central element of the transfer system and adjust transfers per inhabitant by the size of communities, i. e., big communities receive higher transfer per capita than smaller ones. It was feared that especially in the East German Lander the system would fail to equalize fiscal resources of communities as there disparities were even higher than in rural areas of the Western Lander.
