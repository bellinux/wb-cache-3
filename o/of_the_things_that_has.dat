As a consequence of that, the parts of American Culture that he influenced are very much misrepresented". She expounds upon this idea in her book of essays, The Death of Adam. She writes that the Puritans should “by no means be characterized by fear or hatred of the body, anxiety about sex or denigration of women, yet for some reason, Puritanism is uniquely regarded as synonymous with the preoccupations”. Roger Kimball, in his review of The Death of Adam in The New York Times wrote, “We all know that the Puritans were dour, sex-hating, joy-abominating folk - except that, as Robinson shows, this widely embraced caricature is a calumny". The common modern characterization of the Calvinists as haters {{of the physical world}} and joyless exclusivists is the stereotype that Robinson works to deconstruct in Gilead through a representation of what she considers to be a more accurate understanding of Calvinist doctrine that she derives mainly from the original texts, specifically Calvin’s Institutes of the Christian Religion.|$|E

Specifically it has a lot to show us about particular notions of gender and sexuality and how these are related to violence – issues that have pertinence far beyond prison walls as well. The ways in which sexual violence in men’s prisons is understood and lived is largely framed by dominant inmate culture- the behaviours and understandings considered ‘normal ’ in that context and which are upheld by those wielding most power...|$|E

40|$|PY: Marilyn Hood, in {{the very}} early 80 s, {{studying}} audiences in Toledo, found that one thing that differentiated people who went to museums from those who didn't (given identical demographic profiles) was that museum goers thought that learning was a pleasurable experience, and they did go to museums to learn. The ones who chose sporting events and zoos over museums thought of learning as laborious, and not a way to spend leisure. We also found at MOMA that most people listed learning as an important goal when visiting. But that doesn't mean that the notion of learning is not pretty vague. I think the paradox here is that even if they say they want to learn, it is in the rather broad sense of being uplifted and inspired. It is not as if they come to museums to work hard at something. DR: I think one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> shifted the debate about visitor experience in art museums in recent years is the fact that for museum professionals trained in art history, post-modern scholarship rejects the notion of the "masterpiece " that can transform through its electrifying presence.

Character in a narrative or a play, is a person that his mental and moral qualities reflect in his deeds and what he says and does. Creating such characters in a story or a novel that seem to be like real people to the reader is called characterization (Mir Sadeghi, 1382 : p 85). In this article character and characterization in {{one of the}} novels about the eight year war between Iran and Iraq, calling “Palms and Men”, is investigated. Character types, methods of characterization, character appearance, prototype, the relation of character with other elements, and characterization defects are some of the subjects studied in this article. Character types: these characters are generally categorized in two groups of stereotype and type. Samir, Touraj, Reza, Hamid etc. all belong to Sepah forces category which are type characters. Some women characters such as Zeinab, Samir’s mother, Kolsoum, Hanieh’s mother etc. are stereotype characters. Methods of characterization in “Palms and Men” novel:The description of characters is done in two methods by Mr. Nematollah Soleimani:a) Direct characterization: If not all the characters, most of them are certainly characterized in this way. For example in expressing Hamid’s characteristic who is the commander of the mission, he writes, “Hamid didn’t bat an eyelid in any incidents. Hamid was lion-hearted”. (Soleimani, 1380 : 128). In describing uncle Heidar, he writes, “wisdom and insight, and the effects of years of suffering, difficulty, and experiencing could be clearly seen in his limpid eyes. The rural man was indeed a wise and experienced man” (the same: 264 _ 265). b) Indirect Characterization: Although in novels and long stories, direct characterization method is often used, in “Palms and Men” this kind of characterization is also appeared in different conversations, stream of consciousness, deeds and behaviors, appearance descriptions and names. For instance, the inner personality traits of a character such as colonel Nowrouzi, who in the writer’s eye is a courageous, adept warrior while being a disciplined, adamant commander, is reflected in his conversation with the captain. “Colonel we wish u returned behind the lines, we would take u to the field hospital. Again the voice was broken up and after a few seconds the colonel’s voice could be heard, it seemed he was arguing with the soldiers around him. “I won’t withdraw. I tell them too that I won’t return behind the lines… until God willing I make these bastards withdraw for 5 to 6 kilometers tomorrow morning, I won’t move away from here” (the same: 173). Or in describing the appearance of characters, most southern characters are described as being brunet, skinny and tall, such as Samir (the main character), Mahmoud, Reza, Hamid, Touraj etc. “Samir was tall and so skinny that it seemed you could always see his profile. He was dark skinned and had a bony body” (the same: 175). Prototypes can be categorized in different types, including religious, historical, political, social classes, epic, literary prototypes etc. In this novel the characters are categorized in 3 categories of religious, political, and social classes’ prototypes. Because of belonging to the type of “Holly Defense” soldiers and being martyred, the characters of this novel have religious prototype. And the time president’s character (Bani Sadr) is a political and historical prototype in this novel. Social classes’ prototype can be seen in Zarkhedr and Zar Adozahra characters. The relation of character with some story elements:Point of view, time, and theme are the story elements that have affected on better description and process of the characters. By choosing third person point of view, description of characters by omniscient narrator, selection of war period of time, description of real characters at that time, theme of frontage, and liberation of Khoram Shahr, the relation of this theme in deeds and dialogues of characters, the writer better introduces and processes them. Character appearancea) External indicators: job, gender, and age are external indicators that the writer introduces his story characters using them. In this novel the characters are normally young men who belong to “Sepah” troops, which is consistent with the theme and plot of the story and the characters dialogues, thoughts, feelings, and psyche are based on this. b) Internal indicators: internal indicators are used to describe the characters are the characters emotional and spiritual matters, their thoughts and aptitudes; for example Samir’s (the main character) fear of death which is an emotional and spiritual matter is described as: “Samir suffered from a great anxiety, he knew in a vague way that this dreadful worry is caused by fear of death. The consecutive days of fight and flight had wrecked him mentally and spiritually” (Soleimani, 1380 : 106). Also, reasoning of uncle Heidar about war and his eyes that see the appearance of things in another way is narrated as: “The old man said that war is simple as well as a hard subordination of God. Escaping from that is not possible. The ones who escape from the war are actually escaping from themselves. What do they know about the reality of life? You that are in the heart of war have perceived reality if you approach it with a pure, pleased and satisfied soul. He said how great it is to love and to have unshakable faith (the same: 266).

Another problem is about Hanieh that the writer does not mention her previous studies in nursing but in different parts in the story she is pictured as a skillful nurse and being busy with this job. Also, Zarkhedr, Hanieh’s father, is totally disagreed with Samir and Hanieh’s marriage but in the first 100 pages of the story without any logical reason he agrees with their marriage and gives them a power of attorney to wed, while such a revolution requires time and adequate background.

40|$|A {{party in}} Narre Warren has exposed the {{limitations}} of an industry that plays only to mass audiences, writes MARGARET SIMONS SOMETIMESyou need to take your eye off the ball {{in order to see}} what is happening. The silly season is traditionally a time when serious journalism rests, but this year the summer story of the year, about a 16 -year-old kid and his out-of-control party, has revealed a great deal about how journalism works in the new media world and the need for some new thought and new approaches. The kid, from outer suburban Kath and Kim territory in Melbourne?s Narre Warren, held a party without his parents? knowledge. Thanks to his placing an invitation on his Myspace page, together with a flurry of text messaging on the night, he got more guests than he bargained for. About 500 people turned up. When they spilled into the street, upsetting a neighbour?s bird bath and causing a ruckus, dozens of police came to the scene backed up by a helicopter and the drug squad. Too much has already been written about whether the kid is a cool dude or a spoilt brat, {{and the extent to which}} the parents are or are not to blame. That?s not my interest. I want to look at this story as a twenty-first century phenomenon. This kid is from McMansion territory, where every bedroom has a computer capable of publishing material to the world. His story shows us the way in which new media can both create and report on a story, and the ways in which journalism is groping towards ways to cope. Tabloid television has doled out its predictable doses of moral outrage ? which has done nothing but help the development of the kid as a media phenomenon. Under cross examination by Channel Nine?s A Current Affair, he stood bare chested, nipple ring on show and apparently completely comfortable. Over several minutes he coolly refused to be either shamed or reduced to a formula. The reporter repeatedly urged him to take off his trademark cheap plastic sunglasses, look the audience in the eye and apologise. He replied: ?I?ll say sorry but I?m not taking off my glasses? Asked what he would say to other young teenagers thinking of partying without their parents? knowledge, he said ?Get me to do it for you?. As a result it is possible on the internet to buy t-shirts emblazoned with the words ?I?ll say sorry but I?m not taking off my sunglasses. ? Meanwhile the kid has reportedly been offered big money to become an event organiser. The day after the A Current Affair interview screened, the kid wrote to his Facebook fans: ?:take it:BREAKIT ^luvin dis shit^ Ur all Tha GOOD type !!!~~~ Every 1 HiT up tha ||Cnut|| Fkn (maKe) me a groUp Offica! Sik. ? If I may interpret: he was clearly having a good time. Meanwhile he posted a clip of the interview to his Myspace profile page, and changed his image on Facebook to the one that appeared in the media the morning after the party ? semi-naked and wrapped in a pink doona. Compare this to the fate of the Paxton family in 1996. The Paxtons were emblematic of the relationship between media and the powerless at that time. The Paxtons were easy meat for tabloid moral outrage ? not media savvy enough to realise what was being done to them, let alone undermine it. Today Shane Paxton is virtually middle aged and instead we have this new kid in the lens. He is a media adept, with the ability to turn the formulas of traditional media to his own ends, and parlay the attention into a kind of commentary on media, while creating his own celebrity. I am not suggesting he is doing this consciously, nor that he is a hero or to be admired. It just happens. This generation does media, rather than only consuming it or being its subject. The mainstream media, meanwhile, has been largely left to report on what is happening on the internet in much the same way as it would report on other public spaces, such as parliaments and the courts. The language of the stories gives the game away. Journalists are reporting on the kid for the benefit of those who are not themselves denizens of Facebook (or Facepage, as the Herald-Sun mis-named it) or Myspace. Thus journalists define not only themselves but also their audiences as spectators, rather than participants in the process. The kid and his friends are doing media, the audiences of traditional media are expected just to watch. There is a generational issue as well. Much of the reporting has implicitly assumed that the audience is older than the participants in the story. A fair assumption, but hardly a healthy one for traditional media wanting to engage young readers. At some levels traditional media it isn?t coping at all. At the time of writing, this kid is facing charges, which means that because he is a child, it is against the law to name him. Nevertheless, you can look at this Myspace page or this Facebook site or simply Google ?Narre Warren? and ?teenager? and ?party? and find out his name in an instant ? together with his address, his mobile phone number and his family history. Partly this is because mainstream media reports written weeks ago live on in the online world, but it is also because the kid and his friends are creating their own media content, including by cutting and pasting stuff the mainstream media has done. The internet is awash with pictures of the kid, his nipple ring, his bleached blonde hair and his sunglasses. The bloggers and social networkers are naming the kid every day, with no apparent care or awareness that they are breaking the law. The authorities are hardly likely to pursue dozens of ordinary citizens and children for contempt, yet journalists are in the strange position of having to toe the line, since it it is likely action would be taken if they didn?t. This makes the law look foolish, of course, but also highlights the challenge of he new media age. Journalists, because of their institutional affiliations ? their place at the heart of the establishment ? are less able to inform the public than ordinary citizens. The citizens are providing the information for themselves. Of course, big business is adept at cashing in. The internet classified site realestate. com. au was quick to cash in on the kid?s ?brand? by using an image of a teenager very similar to the one in question ? complete with blonde hair and yellow rimmed sunglasses ? to encourage people to look for a new house. The advertising trade magazine B&T reported a spokesperson for the site as saying: ?We have been following the story closely and thought about what it would be like to have 500 people at a party near to where you live, and what would motivate the neighbours to move. The marketing department came up with the idea and we had it checked by our lawyers so decided to run with it. ? So is the kid a victim after all ? his image stolen and made into a commodity? Not really, or not entirely. The kid?s supporters ? or perhaps the kid himself ? hit back with a spoof ad on the rival Domain site. Interested buyers were invited to snap up the $ 20, 000 bargain boasting a host of features including ?NO RentS, NO oLDieZ? a ?massif outdoor entertaining area!? a garden with ?trashed flowerbeds? and "FREE security provided by Copz N Dawg Squad. ? Meanwhile a debate has broken out on the discussions page of the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia about whether this kid (who is of course freely named) merits an entry under the sites ?notability? policy, or whether this is a case of ?recentism,? meaning that his star will fade within the month. This discussion includes reflections on whether the international community that is Wikipedia has the right, or the ability, to comment on what is significant in Australian culture. In other words, there is enough in this saga to fuel media studies and sociology classes for at least a semester. Even the nature of the charges the kid is facing tells a new media tale. One of them is making child pornography. This reportedly relates to pictures he took of girls at the party with his mobile phone. It would be wrong to say the traditional media has completely failed to cope. Google the boy?s name and you will find that although the mainstream media cannot name him, News Limited has bought Google ads activated by his name, and is promoting this site with the words ?everything (boy?s name), news here? The site aggregates all the news, including an open letter to the public from the kid?s parents, and the latest news that he and his folks have agreed to ?give each other some space? until the furor dies down. They may be waiting a while. So what does this tell us about how journalists, need to change? How might the job of reporting by professional journalists be done better, in a more relevant way? Indeed, is there any role at all for journalists in a saga like this one? One of the lessons we should take away is about audiences. Mass media is no longer the only, nor even necessarily the main, game in town. The kid?s party was a media event long before it was reported by journalists. The kid had already informed a niche audience about it through his Myspace page. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> hobbled the mainstream media in its reporting is that it plays only to mass audiences. No professional journalist serves or works with the kid and his peers, or reports to them, or researches stories for them. Yet wouldn?t these kids be well served by a journalists? traditional skills? Wouldn?t they gain from, say, a Freedom of Information request to the Victorian Police to reveal the mechanisms behind the calling out of the dog squad? Or a tough interview with police commissioner Christine Nixon? On the other hand, wouldn?t they be challenged by a series of up close interviews with the neighbours, addressed directly at them, about how frightened they were on the night of the party? Historically, journalism has served to link communities and build common interests. We might not all think the same way, but since the printing press led to the growth of modern media it is likely that we have been thinking about the same sorts of things. We have had a common ?front page? of concerns. This can no longer be taken for granted. Surely, though, the job of the journalist needs to continue in the new media age. The kid and his friends need to be brought into the tent, engaged with the broader society. Or perhaps we need to be brought into their tent. We need to be connected. There are several intersecting communities involved in this story. The kid and his guests. The neighbours. The community of Narre Warren. The people of Victoria. The police. The community of Wikipedia. Isn?t part of the job of journalism to serve, create and engage these communities ? to get them talking to each other? The problem is obvious, though. At present there is no business model to support this kind of journalism. Niche audiences don?t draw enough advertisers or pay enough to support professional journalists. The story of this kid, continuing all over the place even as I write, tells us that new ways will have to be found. Meanwhile, I gather from Facebook that the kid is planning another party, in ?Narre,? in a few weeks? time. The media are bound to be there, but they will be confronted by dozens of mobile phone cameras, digicams and so forth ? wielded by the guests. ?
