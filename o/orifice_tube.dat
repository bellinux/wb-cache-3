40|$|A {{transient}} {{model was}} developed to predict {{the behavior of the}} vapor compression cycle of a mobile air-conditioning system. Mobile air-conditioning systems operate in a transient mode due to variations in compressor speed, variations in condenser air flow rate, and the controls strategy such as clutch-cycling. We developed a model to simulate start-up transients, clutch cycling transients, city-driving transients, and shut-down transients including the following charge redistribution. Our transient model treats the components in a vapor compression refrigeration system including the compressor, condenser, <b>orifice</b> <b>tube,</b> evaporator, and accumulator. The heat exchangers are divided into a series of constant-volume cells. The conservation of mass, conservation of energy, and conservation of momentum equations are applied to each cell. The number of cells and/or the volume of the cells can be changed between simulations in order to change the resolution of the model. The accumulator model is a modification of the heat exchanger model which constrains the outlet to always be vapor. The <b>orifice</b> <b>tube</b> model and the compressor model are semi-empirical. The model is validated with steady-state and transient data obtained from a test facility specifically designed to simulate mobile air-conditioners. The steady-state model predicts most of the system parameters to within ?? 15 %. The transient model predicted the behavior of the city driving cycle, compressor shut-down, compressor start-up, and clutch-cycling simulations well. An important part of the system model is calculating the refrigerant properties correctly. We developed refrigerant property routines to the calculate equilibrium thermodynamic properties in the liquid, vapor, two-phase liquid-vapor, and supercritical region using the Modified-Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation of state. Our property routines accurately solve for a given output property for applicable combinations of input properties. They also accurately predict whether the refrigerant is in the single-phase or two-phase region. The property routines agree extremely well with the experimental data found in the literature.

40|$|Microfluidic {{devices have}} {{recently}} {{emerged as an}} effective method of generating monodisperse emulsion droplets. However, in these and other methods, the drop size that can be produced is typically limited {{by the size of}} the capillary or <b>orifice</b> <b>tube</b> from which the droplet grows. In microfluidic devices, this normally means that the minimum achievable drop size is around 5 to 10 microns. The ability to reduce the drop size still further, into the submicron range, is of interest in a range of applications including drug and gene delivery, medical imaging and nanoparticle synthesis. In this paper we present a novel microfluidic method of synthesizing micron-scale and smaller droplets. Our method utilizes surfactants at the liquid-liquid interface, combined with elongational flow in a microfluidic flow focusing device [1], to promote a phenomenon called tipstreaming. Tipstreaming occurs when a parent drop forms a highly pointed tip, and daughter drops up to two orders of magnitude smaller are ejected from that tip (see [2] and references therein). Recent numerical simulations have shown that tipstreaming occurs in a specific range of surfactant concentration and capillary number [3]. We present experiments in which we systematically vary the surfactant concentration, the capillary number, and the flow rate ratio. We observe that in a particular range of surfactant concentration, large drops are followed by the formation of long thin threads. As the flow rate ratio increases, the thread...|$|E

While the counter cannot distinguish living from dead particles, nor species from species, its use in sizing and counting plankton populations yields values for biomass against time which provide a highly resolved profile of pond dynamics. Peaks of biomass can often be correlated with presence of a particular phytoplankter as determined by simple microscopic examination. Biomass determined in this way was more precise than that obtained by determining chlorophyll a or dry weight. Far more data could bc obtained in a given time by this means than with a hemocytometer.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to study the hydraulic behaviour of small circular openings in plastic water pipes. According to the theoretical orifice equation, the flow through an orifice is proportional to the square root of the pressure. However, a number of field studies have shown that this exponent can be considerably larger than 0. 5, and typically varies between 0. 5 and 2. 79 with a median of 1. 15 (Farley and Trow 2003). The implication is that water losses are substantially more sensitive to pressure than originally thought. Van Zyl and Clayton (2005) proposed four categories of factors that may be responsible for the observed behaviour: leak hydraulics, pipe material behaviour, soil hydraulics and water demand. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the hydraulics of small circular holes in water distribution systems to determine their behaviour under various conditions. Variables studied in {{this investigation}} include pipe material, leak size, surrounding media and pressure fluctuations. Boundary conditions need to be established to accurately simulate the conditions that a pipe in a water network experiences. The author designed and built the apparatus to provide these constant boundary conditions. The apparatus consists of six major components. These are the frame, casing, sample, pressure vessel, constant pressure regulators and measuring equipment. The frame provides structural stability to the apparatus during testing. The casing’s purpose is to house the material that surrounds the sample while being tested; it also creates the constant boundary conditions necessary for the experiments. 1 mm and 2 mm holes are drilled into the uPVC and HDPE pipes. This serves as the test samples. The pressure vessel is used to enable constant pressure with better pressure control. Constant pressure regulators help to provide the required conditions within the casing. The measuring equipment records that data from the experiments. The data is then processed into interpretable information. It was found that leaks discharging into air show good correlation with the theory, but differ significantly from the behaviour of leaks discharging into water or glass beads. Other findings of the study include that pressure fluctuations do not have a significant effect on the leak behaviour, the classification of the opening (as an <b>orifice,</b> <b>tube</b> or pipe) is important and that a discontinuity in the pressure leakage relationship occurs in holes classified as tubes. It is suspected that the discontinuity is caused by separation of the fluid stream from the tube wall, effectively changing it into an orifice. Prof. J. E. Van Zyl Prof. C. R. I. Clayto...|$|E
40|$|Flash gas bypass {{represents}} one of the prospective approaches to improve the efficiency of various small scale heat transfer systems that utilize refrigerant as a working fluid. It is characterized by the bypass of vapor created throughout the expansion process around the evaporator. As the advantages of flash gas removal in R 744 systems are observed, it is of scientific interest to elaborate the same approach in R 134 a or similar low pressure refrigerant A/C systems. The main reason for this is the fact that lower pressure fluids are more affected by pressure drop, therefore flash gas removal which reduces low system side pressure drop will be more beneficial utilizing these fluids. This project developed a methodology for studying phase separation in compact vessels and analyzing their impact inR 134 a automotive A/C systems. The flash gas bypass concept would be attractive for commercial implementation if a compact separation vessel could efficiently separate refrigerant phases over wide ranges of flow conditions and the simple flow controlling device could be exploited in the flash gas bypass line. It would be convenient if the phase separation vessel could be implemented in the evaporator header. A methodic approach has been implemented analyzing T -junctions as a starting design, studying the mechanisms of phase separation and paving the way towards more advanced geometries. To our knowledge, the idea of implementing compact and efficient separation devices in the heat exchanger header is a unique approach that is not been studied elsewhere.. Two T-junctions with inlet tube diameters 8. 7 mm and 12 mm, with body diameters 18. 3 and 23. 8 mm respectively, are examined and analyzed at a range of mass flow rates and vapor qualities typically found in automotive A/C systems. The quantification of both vapor and liquid phase separation efficiencies has been defined. The 18. 3 mm body diameter T-junction could efficiently separate liquid up to 30 g/s and 20 % vapor quality, while the 23. 8 mm diameter flash tank could perform efficient phase separation up to 45 g/s and 15 % vapor quality. Based on the observed phase separation phenomena, separation enhancers could increase the separation efficiency. The impact on the A/C system level has been analyzed using a T-junction with 23. 8 mm body diameter. At matched capacities to the Baseline DX system, the Flash Gas Bypass system showed significant improvements in the system efficiency (COP), up to 55 %. The reason for such high improvement {{lies in the fact that}} the evaporator was slightly undersized when compared to the rest of the A/C system components. A needle valve was utilized to control the flash gas bypass flow. The flash gas bypass valve opening had a significant effect on system performance., The system had the highest improvement in COP with the flash gas bypass valve opened ?? turn (valve flow coefficient approximately 0. 25), when compared to the Baseline DX configuration at matched capacity.

40|$|The {{off-cycle}} {{refrigerant mass}} migration {{has a direct}} influence on the on-cycle performance since compressor energy is necessary to redistribute the refrigerant mass. No studies, as of today, {{are available in the}} open literature which experimentally measured the lubricant migration within a refrigeration system during cycling or stop/start transients. Therefore, experimental procedures measuring the refrigerant and lubricant migration through the major components of a refrigeration system during stop/start transients were developed and implemented. Results identifying the underlying physics are presented. The refrigerant and lubricant migration of an R 134 a automotive A/C system-utilizing a fixed <b>orifice</b> <b>tube,</b> minichannel condenser, plate and fin evaporator, U-tube type accumulator and fixed displacement compressor-was measured across five sections divided by ball valves. Using the Quick-Closing Valve Technique (QCVT) combined with the Remove and Weigh Technique (RWT) using liquid nitrogen as the condensing agent resulted in a measurement uncertainty of 0. 4 percent regarding the total refrigerant mass in the system. The determination of the lubricant mass distribution was achieved by employing three different techniques-Remove and Weigh, Mix and Sample, and Flushing. To employ the Mix and Sample Technique a device-called the Mix and Sample Device-was built. A method to separate the refrigerant and lubricant was developed with an accuracy-after separation-of 0. 04 grams of refrigerant left in the lubricant. When applying the three techniques, the total amount of lubricant mass in the system was determined to within two percent. The combination of measurement results-infrared photography and high speed and real time videography-provide unprecedented insight into the mechanisms of refrigerant and lubricant migration during stop-start operation. During the compressor stop period, the primary refrigerant mass migration is caused by, and follows, the diminishing pressure difference across the expansion device. The secondary refrigerant migration is caused by a pressure gradient as a result of thermal nonequilibrium within the system and causes only vapor phase refrigerant migration. Lubricant migration is proportional to the refrigerant mass during the primary refrigerant mass migration. During the secondary refrigerant mass migration lubricant is not migrating. The start-up refrigerant mass migration is caused by an imbalance of the refrigerant mass flow rates across the compressor and expansion device. The higher compressor refrigerant mass flow rate was a result of the entrainment of foam into the U-tube of the accumulator. The lubricant mass migration during the start-up was not proportional to the refrigerant mass migration. The presence of water condensate on the evaporator affected the refrigerant mass migration during the compressor stop period. Caused by an evaporative cooling effect the evaporator held 56 percent of the total refrigerant mass in the system after three minutes of compressor stop time-compared to 25 percent when no water condensate was present on the evaporator coil. Foam entrainment led to a faster lubricant and refrigerant mass migration out of the accumulator than liquid entrainment through the hole {{at the bottom of the}} U-tube. The latter was observed for when water condensate was present on the evaporator coil because-as a result of the higher amount of refrigerant mass in the evaporator before start-up-the entrainment of foam into the U-tube of the accumulator ceased before the steady state refrigerant mass distribution was reached...|$|E

40|$|The {{basic pulse}} tube {{refrigerator}} produces cooling by a mechanism known as surface heat pumping. Cyclical compression {{and expansion of}} a gas within an enclosed tube produces large temperature gradients. The purpose of the tube is to act as 'nodal regenerator'. Heat is stored at node positions along the tube wall and is transported between nodes by moving gas parcels. This process gives rise to refrigeration, with hot temperatures at the closed end and cold temperatures at the open end. Unfortunately, much of the available refrigeration is not realized because the closed end of the basic pulse tube restricts gas movement - gas at the extreme temperatures does not {{come in contact with}} the heat exchangers. The <b>orifice</b> pulse <b>tube</b> overcomes this limitation by using a valve and surge volume assembly at the warm, closed end.

The chlorine atom in these refrigerants is capable of reaching the upper atmosphere where one chlorine atom can destroy more than 100, 000 ozone atoms(Lang 1 ey 1994). Laws have been enacted to halt {{the destruction of the}} ozone layer and force industry to find replacements for the ozone depleting refrigerants. Section 608 of the Clean Air Act (1990) prohibited the venting of ozone depleting refrigerants as of July 1, 1992. In addition the Clean Air Act (1990) also requires the EPA to develop regulations limiting the emissions of ozone depleting refrigerants. Efforts are currently underway to find CFC replacements before the complete phaseout of CFC manufacturing in January of 1996. Much of the effort to replace CFC and HCFC refrigerants has centered on development of refrigerant mixtures that could replace R- 22. Before systems can be designed with a new refrigerant (or mixture), thermodynamic and thermophysical properties must first be characterized. An important component in air conditioners is the expansion device. Because of their low cost, several manufacturers have chosen to use short <b>tube</b> <b>orifices</b> for the expansion device in their systems. Designing a system with an orifice requires knowledge of the flow characteristics of short <b>tube</b> <b>orifices.</b> Recent work on orifices has focused on R- 12 and R- 22 (Kim and O'Neal, 1993 a; Aaron and Domanski, 1990; Krakow, 1988; and Mei, 1982).

Equating the torus with its tonsil however might be seen as incorrect or imprecise.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{surgical}} {{management of}} cholesteatoma is a controversial issue, particularly regarding intact-canal-wall mastoidectomy (ICWM) versus canal-wall-down mastoidectomy (CWDM). The current experiment compared {{the quality of}} visualization in different middle ear structures using ICWM with otoendoscopy with findings of CWDM by microscopy. Materials and Methods: The patients diagnosed with cholesteatoma underwent tympanomastoidectomy, and then the patients selected for CWDM {{were included in the}} study (25 patients: 11 females and 14 males). After removing the cholesteatoma from the involved areas, otoendoscopic examination was done with a 4 mm, 0 ΀ endoscope by a neurootologist. All five middle ear structures (lateral epitympanum, sinus tympani, posterior crus of the stapes, round window niche, and Eustachian <b>tube</b> <b>orifice)</b> suspected of occult cholesteatoma were evaluated in terms of having or lacking the pathology. Then, CWDM was performed and all of the mentioned sites were reevaluated for diagnosing occult cholesteatoma. Results: The symmetric measures were 73 %, 92 %, 63 %, 81 %, and 100 % for lateral epitympanum, sinus tympani, posterior crus of the stapes, round window niche, and Eustachian <b>tube</b> <b>orifice,</b> respectively. Conclusion: Otoendoscopy was confirmed to have a great potential to be adopted by surgeons as a less invasive procedure in the surgical management of middle ear cholesteatoma...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} an <b>Orifice</b> Pulse <b>Tube</b> (OPT) Cryocooler has been {{validated}} and {{applied for the}} design of Inertance Pulse Tube (IPT) Cryocooler with 15 W at 70 K. Parametric analysis based on cyclic simulation model {{has been used as a}} design tool. This model begins with the estimates of the ideal refrigerating effect and ideal power requirement. Different losses in refrigerating effect and power are later incorporated to arrive at the net refrigeration effect and gross power requirements. Based on this information, the IPT cryocooler has been developed. A matching moving coil type opposed piston linear compressor has been designed and developed to meet the requirements of this IPT cryocooler. The system comprising IPT cryocooler and linear compressor has been installed and commissioned. To validate the design, detailed experimental investigations on the IPT are planned. Some of the experimental results are reported in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. A phasor diagram for a {{pulse tube}} {{refrigerator}} (PTR) is a vectorial representation of mass flow rate, pressure, and temperature at different locations {{as a function}} of time. With the help of a phasor diagram, the operation of different types of pulse tube refrigerators can be well understood. Phasor analysis based on these diagrams gives an idea regarding the underlying complex phenomena of the PTR. In the present work, a simplified model has been presented {{based on the assumption that}} there is no phase difference between temperature and pressure throughout the working space. The phasor analysis is extended to a two-stage <b>Orifice</b> Pulse <b>Tube</b> Refrigerator (OPTR) and to a Double Inlet PTR (DIPTR). The important contribution of the work is that it highlights the condition for which the DIPTR will work better than the OPTR...|$|R
40|$|A {{commercial}} Computational {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) software package Fluent 6. 1 {{is used to}} model the oscillating flow inside a pulse tube cryocooler. In this paper analysis of <b>orifice</b> type pulse <b>tube</b> refrigerator (OPTR) systems operating {{under a variety of}} thermal boundary conditions are modeled at different frequencies. The compressor used is having dual opposed piston arrangement. The simulations are done at different frequencies with helium as working fluid. The simulated OPTR consists of a compressor (dual opposed piston), a transfer line, an after cooler, a regenerator, a pulse tube, a pair of heat exchangers for cold and hot end, an orifice valve and a reservoir. The simulation represents fully coupled systems operating in steady-periodic mode. The externally imposed boundary conditions are a cyclically moving piston wall {{at one end of the}} tube and constant temperature or heat flux boundaries at the external walls of the hot end and cold end heat exchangers. The experimental method to evaluate the optimum parameters of OPTR is difficult. On the other hand, developing a computer code for CFD analysis is equally complex. The objectives of the present investigation are to ascertain the suitability of CFD based commercial package, Fluent and also to examine the performance for the effect of compressor frequency on the <b>orifice</b> type pulse <b>tube</b> refrigerator (OPTR) ...|$|R

We {{show that the}} plasma jet is essentially a streamer corona totally independent of, but obscured by, dielectric barrier discharge. Consequently, the jets can be equally successfully generated even with one single bare metal electrode attached to the <b>tube</b> <b>orifice,</b> both downstream and upstream simultaneously, and at a significantly reduced voltage. These results will help understand the underlying physics and facilitate a safer and more flexible implementation of this marvelous plasma source...|$|R
