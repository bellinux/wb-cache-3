5|$|The {{area near}} the border with Cameroon close to the coast is rich {{rainforest}} {{and part of the}} Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests ecoregion, an important centre for biodiversity. It is habitat for the drill monkey, which is found in the wild <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area and across the border in Cameroon. The areas surrounding Calabar, Cross River State, also in this forest, are believed to contain the world's largest diversity of butterflies. The area of southern Nigeria between the Niger and the Cross Rivers has lost most of its forest because of development and harvesting by increased population, with it being replaced by grassland (see Cross-Niger transition forests).|$|E

25|$|Ssd encoded by rv3660c {{promotes}} filamentation in M. tuberculosis {{in response}} to the stressful intracellular environment. Recently, septum site determining protein (Ssd) was discovered in this bacteria as a septum inhibitor, leading to elongated cells (not <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> species but also in Mycobacterium smegmatis). The bacterial filament ultrastructure is consistent with inhibition of FtsZ polymerization (previously described). Ssd is believed {{to be part of a}} global regulatory mechanism in this bacteria that promotes a shift into an altered metabolic state.|$|E

The mayor of Vienna had receptables placed in many sites around Vienna for people to donate coins <b>only.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> way, everyone in Vienna could say they had participated in the reconstruction and feel pride in considering themselves part owners.|$|E

25|$|Many notable dances {{are found}} in the state of Guerrero. The three most common dances of the coast of Oaxaca and Guerrero are the Devil Dance, the Turtle Dance and the Toro de Petate (Straw Bull Dance), all of which are tied to the area’s Afro-Mexican communities. The first three {{contains}} characteristics which are found <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> region and nowhere else in Mexico and include violence and even sexual overtures. The main characters, devils, turtles and bulls represented by those in masks, are mythical creatures which dance in the streets alongside humans who either challenge or subdue them. Other important Afro-Mexican dances include the Tiger Dance and the Tejorones.|$|E
25|$|Everything {{that has}} {{happened}} since has therefore been planned by God to help humanity overcome this initial mishap and achieve spiritual maturity. The world has been intentionally designed by God as a difficult place, where human beings are forced to make moral decisions, as <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way can they mature as moral agents. Irenaeus likens death to the big fish that swallowed Jonah: {{it was only in}} the depths of the whale's belly that Jonah could turn to God and act according to the divine will. Similarly, death and suffering appear as evils, but without them we could never come to know God.|$|E
25|$|In the Critique of Practical Reason, {{at the end}} of {{the second}} Main Part of the Analytics, Kant {{introduces}} the categories of freedom, in analogy with the categories of understanding their practical counterparts. Kant's categories of freedom apparently function primarily as conditions for the possibility for actions (i) to be free, (ii) to be understood as free and (iii) to be morally evaluated. For Kant, although actions as theoretical objects are constituted by means of the theoretical categories, actions as practical objects (objects of practical use of reason, and which can be good or bad) are constituted by means of the categories of freedom. <b>Only</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way can actions, as phenomena, be a consequence of freedom, and be understood and evaluated as such.|$|E
