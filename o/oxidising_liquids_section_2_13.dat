Physiol. 60 (l) : 280 - 288, 1986. -The effects of moderate and severe hypoxia on quantitative regional morphometric indexes {{of the total}} and perfused arteriolar and capillary network were studied in the rat brain to determine whether diffusion distances were reduced in hypoxia. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labeled dextran was injected into the femoral vein of conscious control and hypoxic rats. After 20 s, the animal was decapitated and the head was frozen in <b>liquid</b> N <b>2.</b> <b>Sections</b> from eight brain regions were photographed to detect the perfused microvessels and then stained for alkaline phosphatase to visualize the total vascular network. There were significant increases in percent perfused arteriolar and capillary morphology {{between the two groups}} of hypoxic animals and control animals. In control rats...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{an original}} numerical coupling between surface mechanics of a gradually oxidizing liquid metal surface, and a supporting annular MHD flow, {{in the general}} layout of the classical annular viscometer, originally developed by Mannheimer et al. [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 32 (1970) 195 - 211]. A purely hydrodynamic interplay between a main azimuthal flow (induced by a rotating floor) and a secondary overturning flow generated by centrifugation {{is found to be}} strongly affected by both surface viscous shear and surface viscous dilatation. When centrifugation competes with electromagnetic effects, advection of the main flow by the secondary flow is proved to affect significantly the core MHD flow, leading to original MHD flow patterns. The latter phenomenology reveals to be relevant to characterise the surface viscosities of a gradually <b>oxidising</b> <b>liquid</b> metal surface...|$|R
