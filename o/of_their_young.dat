5|$|By 1816, the Shelleys {{were living}} in Italy and in 1818 and 1819, two <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>young</b> {{children}} died, Clara and William. Mary entered into a deep depression and became alienated from Percy, who was not as deeply affected {{by the loss of}} their children. Mary Shelley revived a bit with the birth of Percy Florence later in 1819.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the schooling of girls on the education <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> siblings. In order to examine the causal impact of the education of older children on <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> siblings, we take advantage of a stipend program targeted towards girls, but not boys of the same cohort. The program causes exogenous variation in schooling of girls which enable us to estimate the effects <b>of</b> <b>their</b> education on the education <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> siblings. We find that the education of older siblings has a significant positive effect on the schooling <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> siblings. The results suggest that an additional year of schooling of older siblings increases the schooling <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>younger</b> siblings by about 0. 13 years. The stipend program can account about a 10 per cent increase in the schooling of younger siblings. The results suggest that such programs could bring both short- and long-term gains, not only via direct benefits to the affected children, but also via indirect benefits to their siblings...|$|R

5|$|A {{desert is}} not the kind of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for the development <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>young.</b> Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E
5|$|Maha Chakkraphat {{decided to}} leave the capital with his forces, to engage Tabinshwehti and test the Burmese strength. On this occasion, he mounted his chief war elephant. Accompanying him were his Chief Queen, Sri Suriyothai, and one <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>young</b> daughters, Princess Boromdhilok, the two riding {{together}} on a smaller war elephant. Both royal ladies were dressed in male military attire (helmet and armour), with the queen wearing the uniform of an Uparaja. Also accompanying their father on elephant mounts were two sons, the Uparaja and heir apparent, Prince Ramesuan, and his brother Prince Mahin.|$|E
5|$|Mother hippos {{are very}} {{protective}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>young</b> and may keep others at a distance. However, calves are occasionally left in nurseries which are guarded {{by one or}} a few adults. Calves in nurseries engage in playfights. Weaning starts between six and eight months after birth, and most calves are fully weaned after a year. Like many other large mammals, hippos are described as K-strategists, in this case typically producing just one large, well-developed infant every couple of years (rather than many small, poorly developed young several times per year as is common among small mammals such as rodents).|$|E

5|$|The care of {{offspring}} among amphibians {{has been}} little studied but, in general, the larger the number of eggs in a batch, the less {{likely it is that}} any degree of parental care takes place. Nevertheless, it is estimated that in up to 20% of amphibian species, one or both adults play some role in the care of the young. Those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>young.</b>|$|E
5|$|The early European {{settlers}} killed emus {{to provide}} food and used their fat for fuelling lamps. They {{also tried to}} prevent them from interfering with farming or invading settlements in search of water during drought. An extreme example of this was the Emu War in Western Australia in 1932. Emus flocked to the Chandler and Walgoolan area during a dry spell, damaging rabbit fencing and devastating crops. An attempt to drive them off was mounted, with the army called in to dispatch them with machine guns; the emus largely avoided the hunters and won the battle. Emus are large, powerful birds, and their legs are among the strongest of any animal and powerful enough to tear down metal fencing. The birds are very defensive <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>young,</b> and there have been two documented cases of humans being attacked by emus.|$|E

25|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>young</b> age, the girls' {{fear and}} {{emotional}} dependence, and vagueness about what exactly happened, often loverboys and their associates {{may only be}} charged with {{having sex with a}} minor and thus receive short sentences.

25|$|Some birds seem to {{lack the}} {{perception}} of grief or quickly accept it- for example, Mallard hens, although shocked for a moment when losing one <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>young</b> to a predator, will soon return to doing {{what they were doing}} before the predator attacked. However, some other waterbirds, such as Mute swans, are known to grieve for the loss of a partner or cygnet, and are known to engage in pining for days, weeks or even months at a time.|$|E

25|$|Bitterlings have a {{remarkable}} reproduction strategy where parents transfer {{responsibility for the}} care <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>young</b> to mussels. The female extends her ovipositor into the mantle cavity of the mussel and deposits her eggs between the gill filaments. The male then ejects his sperm into the mussel's inhalant water current and fertilization takes place within the gills of the host. The same female may use a number of mussels, and she deposits {{only one or two}} yellow, oval eggs into each. Early developmental stages are protected from predation within the body of the mussel. After 3 to 4 weeks larvae swim away from the host to continue life on their own.|$|E

This product line aims to teach aspects of American history through a six-book series {{from the perspective of a}} girl living in that time period. Although the books are written for girls who are at least eight years old, they endeavor to cover significant topics such as child labor, child abuse, poverty, racism, slavery, animal abuse and war in manners appropriate for the understanding and sensibilities <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>young</b> audience.|$|E
25|$|France, the holders, and England {{ended their}} Group B {{encounter}} in furious fashion as the French scored twice in injury {{time to go}} from 1–0 down to 2–1 winners. Zinedine Zidane scored in the first minute of injury time and two minutes later, an error by the English defence gave a France penalty and Zidane fired in the winner. England's other two games were memorable for the performances <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>young</b> star Wayne Rooney. Only 18 at the time, Rooney's goal-scoring ability proved instrumental in victories over Switzerland (3–0) and Croatia (4–2). France and England qualified from the group as winners and runners-up, respectively.|$|E
