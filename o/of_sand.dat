40|$|A {{new method}} of {{specimen}} reconstitution is presented that {{is appropriate for}} element testing <b>of</b> <b>sands</b> containing either plastic or nonplastic fines. The method allows reconstitution of homogeneous, saturated specimens <b>of</b> <b>sands</b> containing fines whose stress-strain response closely resembles the stress-strain response of natural soil deposits formed underwater (e. g., alluvial and offshore submarine deposits, hydraulic fills, and tailings dams). A procedure is described to evaluate the maximum void ratio (emax) <b>of</b> <b>sands</b> containing fines under conditions that more appropriately represent soil deposition at its loosest state in aquatic environments. For soils deposited in water, the data obtained with the procedure proposed in this paper suggest that ASTM D 4254 overestimates the emax <b>of</b> <b>sands</b> containing plastic fines and underestimates the emax <b>of</b> <b>sands</b> containing nonplastic fines.

5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal.

However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely <b>of</b> <b>sand.</b> The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the research of}} selected properties of spruce dust generated from experimental sanding by a hand belt sander with two sanding models - along the wood fibres and perpendicular to the wood fibres in the radial direction. The experiment was carried out {{for the purpose of}} obtaining the basic characteristics <b>of</b> wood <b>sanding</b> dust – granularity, size and shape of individually formed particles, and bulk properties (bulk density, bulk angle, and tilt angle) that are important for suction, which is connected with the quality of living and working environments. The particles smaller than 100 micrometers are unsuitable for both environments, since they do not sediment in space at all or only partly, and they are characterized as airborne dust. The most harmful particles for humans are those smaller than 2. 5 μm as they reach the lung alveoli. When sanding wood the finest particles are formed and therefore {{it is important to know}} the basic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>sanding</b> dust in order to deal with these problems effectively. On the basis of the mesh sieve analysis, we can state that in sanding perpendicular to the wood fibres the share of particles smaller than 100 μm is 76. 94 % on average and along the wood fibres it is only 56. 01 %. The structure, shape and size of particles were investigated by microscope. When using the longitudinal model <b>of</b> <b>sanding,</b> the fibrous elements were formed for the most part. When using the perpendicular model, isometric particles were predominantly formed in smaller fractions and particles of fibrous shape in larger fractions. The smallest particles were found in the following samples. When the perpendicular model <b>of</b> <b>sanding</b> was used, we have found the smallest particle in the investigated samples with the diameter of 1. 68 μm, and when the longitudinal model <b>of</b> <b>sanding</b> was used, the particle with the diameter of 1. 75 μm. Bulk density of spruce dust from the longitudinal model <b>of</b> <b>sanding</b> is 77. 77 kg · m- 3, while dust from the perpendicular model <b>of</b> <b>sanding</b> is 116. 68 kg · m- 3. Tilt angle of spruce dust in a longitudinal direction <b>of</b> <b>sanding</b> is 33. 4 °, and in a perpendicular direction it is 37. 4 °. Bulk angle for the perpendicular model <b>of</b> <b>sanding</b> is 48. 7 °, and for longitudinal model <b>of</b> <b>sanding</b> it is 48. 3 °. The obtained results have confirmed that the model <b>of</b> <b>sanding</b> at which wood dust was formed is a significant factor affecting properties of wood bulk material...|$|R

5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of the dune and individual grains <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> grains takes place, the dune moves slowly {{across the surface of the}} ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E

5|$|The {{shape of}} the dune depends on the {{characteristics}} of the prevailing wind. Barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface, and are crescent-shaped with the concave side away from the wind. When there are two directions from which winds regularly blow, a series of long, linear dunes known as seif dunes may form. These also occur parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run at a right angle to the prevailing wind direction. Star dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point. They tend to grow vertically; they can reach a height of , making them the tallest type of dune. Rounded mounds <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> seas.|$|E
