5|$|The {{members of}} his staff were anxious for the {{president}} to appear to be recovering quickly, and the morning after his operation he saw visitors and signed a piece of legislation. Reagan left the hospital on the 13th day. Initially, he worked two hours a day in the White House's residential quarters, with meetings held there instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office.</b> Reagan did not lead a Cabinet meeting until day 26, did not leave Washington until day 49, and did not hold a press conference until day 79. Ruge, the Physician to the President, thought recovery was not complete until October. Reagan's plans for the month after the shooting were canceled, including a visit to the Mission Control Center at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, in April 1981 during STS-1, the first flight of the Space Shuttle. Vice President Bush instead called the orbiting astronauts during their mission. Reagan would visit Mission Control during STS-2 that November.|$|E
25|$|A few {{independent}} museums also display replicas, including The Presidents Hall of Fame in Clermont, Florida, The Quality West Wing Foundation Museum in Corona, California, a children's {{educational program}} focusing on U.S. government, history, and the Presidency; {{along with the}} educational program there is a replica <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> available by appointment; the Treehouse Children's Museum, in Ogden, Utah, which features a small-scale Oval Office; and a full-scale replica <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> {{open to the public}} at the American Village in Montevallo, Alabama.|$|E

500|$|The Clinton Library {{features}} numerous {{items from}} Clinton's time as president. Clinton's Cadillac One is on <b>the</b> first floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main building. The second floor includes the main gallery. It {{consists of a}} [...] timeline of each of Clinton's years as President, as well as 14 alcoves featuring various events during Clinton's terms. There is an orientation theater and full-size replicas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clinton-era <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> and Cabinet Room as well. <b>The</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> exhibit is <b>the</b> only full-size model <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> in any presidential library, and was constructed using thousands of photos taken by White House officials <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original office.|$|R
2500|$|The William J. Clinton Presidential Center {{includes}} the Clinton presidential library and <b>the</b> offices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clinton Foundation and <b>the</b> Clinton School <b>of</b> Public Service. <b>The</b> Library facility, designed by architect James Polshek, cantilevers over the Arkansas River, echoing Clinton's campaign promise of [...] "building {{a bridge to}} the 21st century". The archives and library contains 2 million photographs, 80 million pages of documents, 21 million e-mail messages, and nearly 80,000 artifacts from the Clinton presidency. The museum within the library showcases artifacts from Clinton's term and has a full-scale replica <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clinton-era <b>Oval</b> <b>Office.</b> Opened on November 18, 2004, the Clinton Presidential Center cost $165 million to construct and covers 150,000 square feet (14,000 m²) within a 28-acre (113,000 m²) park.|$|R
25|$|Presidential traditions also {{involve the}} president's role {{as head of}} government. Many {{outgoing}} presidents since James Buchanan traditionally give advice to their successor during the presidential transition. Ronald Reagan and his successors have also left a private message on the desk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> on Inauguration Day for the incoming president.|$|E
25|$|Museums in Austin {{include the}} Texas Memorial Museum, the George Washington Carver Museum and Cultural Center, Thinkery, the Blanton Museum of Art (reopened in 2006), the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum {{across the street}} (which opened in 2000), The Contemporary Austin, the Elisabet Ney Museum and the {{galleries}} at the Harry Ransom Center. The Texas State Capitol itself is also a major tourist attraction. The Driskill Hotel built in 1886, once owned by George W. Littlefield, and located at 6th and Brazos streets, was finished just before {{the construction of the}} Capitol building. Sixth Street is a musical hub for the city. The Enchanted Forest, a multi-acre outdoor music, art, and performance art space in South Austin hosts events such as fire-dancing and circus-like-acts. Austin is also home to the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum, which houses documents and artifacts related to the Johnson administration, including LBJ's limousine and a re-creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{organization}} of the exhibits within the main building {{was inspired by the}} famous Long Room in the Old Library at Trinity College, Dublin, which Clinton first saw when he was a Rhodes Scholar. The Cadillac One used during Clinton's presidency is housed on the first floor. On the second floor, the main gallery houses a [...] timeline, representing each of Clinton's years as President. There is also an 80-seat theater, the Great Hall, and the replicas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> and Cabinet Room. The restaurant is located in the basement.|$|E
50|$|Before his May 25, 1973 {{appointment}} as Richard Nixon's attorney general, Elliott Richardson had agreed at his senate confirmation hearing {{to appoint a}} Watergate special prosecutor, and so immediately on taking office appointed Archibald Cox. As part of his investigation, in July of that year, Cox first requested and then subpoenaed the Nixon White House tapes; secret recordings Nixon had made <b>of</b> conversations in <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> and elsewhere. <b>The</b> Nixon administration refused to produce the tapes citing executive privilege, and the dispute was fought in court until October.|$|R
25|$|The United States has {{a history}} of {{recognizing}} and celebrating Hanukkah in a number <b>of</b> ways. <b>The</b> earliest Hanukkah link with the White House occurred in 1951 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion presented United States President Harry Truman with a Hanukkah Menorah. In 1979 president Jimmy Carter took part in the first public Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Menorah held across the White House lawn. In 1989, President George H.W. Bush displayed a menorah in the White House. In 1993, President Bill Clinton invited a group <b>of</b> schoolchildren to <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> for a small ceremony.|$|R
40|$|Barack Obama’s {{foreign policy}} is characterised by both change and continuity. He has not ended the War on Terror, but he has {{reshaped}} the conflict, in ways that fit with his personal views on war, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> force and <b>the</b> American national interest. At times, his values have run up against <b>the</b> realities <b>of</b> occupying <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> (e. g. <b>the</b> failure to close Guantanamo) and, at others, he has adapted his thinking on seeing firsthand the threats the American nation continues to face (e. g. after the Christmas Day bomb plot). <b>The</b> interplay <b>of</b> choice and constraint has featured in many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapters in this book. Here, we begin by laying out some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> considerable areas <b>of</b> agreement that they share, despite competing theoretical approaches. Second, we consider how appeals to volition and structural limitation might be reconciled through a structural-relational understanding of structure and agency. Third, we outline one, potentially fruitful, way of conceptualising change and continuity in American foreign policy, which helps to account for Obama’s apparently prolonged period of stasis. Fourth, and finally, we turn to consider where Obama’s foreign policy will head during his second term in office, based both on the contributions to this volume and the issues his presidency is likely to face {{in the next four}} years...|$|R
500|$|Gaga had {{revealed}} during ArtRave {{that she and}} Kelly would perform [...] "Do What U Want" [...] at the American Music Awards of 2013 on November 24. During the performance, Gaga enacted {{the role of a}} secretary for the President of the United States, which was played by Kelly. The stage was set up to be reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office.</b> Gaga belted out the final chorus of the song alone, as the backdrops displayed a video of the singer playing a piano as a child. The epilogue featured self-depreciating newspaper headlines in the backdrops, proclaiming [...] "Lady Gaga is Over" [...] and [...] "Lady Gaga is Fat". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard called it [...] "the most elaborate performance" [...] of the ceremony and found parallels with Kelly's own rap opera Trapped in the Closet in its storytelling.|$|E
2500|$|Also furthering this {{misconception}} was {{an episode}} of The West Wing entitled [...] "What Kind of Day Has It Been?", aired in 2000. Character Admiral Fitzwallace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, observed that the presidential seal in the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> carpet contained a shield bearing a bald eagle clutching the olive branch in its right talons and arrows in its left. The eagle's head was turned toward the olive branch. Fitzwallace mentioned that in times of war, the Seal is replaced with {{one in which the}} eagle's head is turned toward the arrows. This is inaccurate.|$|E

2500|$|President William Howard Taft {{enlisted the}} help of {{architect}} Nathan C. Wyeth to add additional space to the West Wing, which included the addition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office.</b> [...] In 1925, Congress enacted legislation allowing the White House to accept gifts of furniture and art for the first time. The West Wing was damaged by fire in 1929, but rebuilt during the remaining years of the Herbert Hoover presidency. In the 1930s, a second story was added, as well as a larger basement for White House staff, and President Franklin Roosevelt had the Oval Office moved to its present location: adjacent to the Rose Garden.|$|E
2500|$|On October 27, 2005, Jay-Z headlined New York's Power 105.1 annual concert, Powerhouse. The {{concert was}} {{entitled}} the [...] "I Declare War" [...] concert leading to intense speculation {{in the weeks}} preceding the event on whom exactly Jay-Z would declare war. As he had previously [...] "declared war" [...] on other artists taking lyrical shots at him at other events, many believed that the Powerhouse show would represent an all-out assault by Jay-Z upon his rivals. The theme of the concert was Jay-Z's position as President and CEO of Def Jam, complete with an on-stage mock-up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office.</b> Many artists made appearances such as the old roster of Roc-A-Fella records artists, as well as Ne-Yo, Teairra Marí, T.I., Young Jeezy, Akon, Kanye West, Paul Wall, The LOX, and Diddy.|$|E
