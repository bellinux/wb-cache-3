5|$|A {{large number}} of strains {{belonging}} to this species have been isolated and characterised. In addition to serotype (vide supra), they can be classified according to their phylogeny, i.e. the inferred evolutionary history, as shown below where the species is divided into six groups. Particularly the use <b>of</b> <b>whole</b> genome sequences yields highly supported phylogenies. Based on such data, five subspecies of E. coli were distinguished.|$|E

5000|$|The {{issue of}} how change in nature 'emerged' {{can be found in}} {{classical}} Greek thought - order coming out of chaos and whether by chance or necessity.

The second-century anatomist and physiologist Galen also distinguished between the resultant and emergent qualities <b>of</b> <b>wholes.</b> (Reid, p. 72) ...|$|R

The difference between a committee <b>of</b> the <b>whole</b> and a quasi committee <b>of</b> the <b>whole</b> {{is that in the}} latter, the presiding officer of the assembly remains in the chair and presides. Informal consideration simply removes the normal limitations on the number of times members can speak in debate.|$|R

However, attempts to embark his 3,000 men ended in chaos; with only 1,200 men managing to board because of a shortage of boats and the artillery taking up an unexpected amount of space on board. Amid torrential rain and freezing cold, a council of war headed by Smyth decided to postpone the invasion pending more thorough preparations that would enable the embarkation <b>of</b> <b>whole</b> force.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general views {{have been}} criticized for not fully {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms <b>of</b> <b>whole</b> objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{sequences}} are paralogous if {{they were}} created by a duplication event within the genome. For gene duplication events, if a gene in an organism is duplicated to occupy two different positions in the same genome, then the two copies are paralogous. Paralogous genes often {{belong to the same}} species. They can shape the structure <b>of</b> <b>whole</b> genomes and thus explain genome evolution to a large extent. Examples include the Homeobox (Hox) genes in animals. These genes not only underwent gene duplications within chromosomes but also whole genome duplications. As a result, Hox genes in most vertebrates are clustered across multiple chromosomes with the HoxA-D clusters being the best studied.|$|E

5|$|Many of Grant's {{associates}} {{were able}} to capture his confidence through flattery and brought their intrigues openly to his attention. One of these men, Orville E. Babcock, was a subtle and unscrupulous enemy of reformers, having served as Grant's personal secretary for seven years while living in the White House. Babcock, twice indicted, gained indirect control <b>of</b> <b>whole</b> departments of the government, planted suspicions of reformers in Grant's mind, plotted their downfall, and sought to replace them with men like himself. Grant allowed Babcock to be a stumbling block for reformers who might have saved the President from scandal. Grant's secretary of state, Hamilton Fish, who was often at odds with Babcock, made efforts to save Grant's reputation by advocating that reformers be appointed to or kept in public office. Grant also unwisely accepted gifts from wealthy donors that cast doubts on his reputability.|$|E
5|$|Measurement of {{antioxidant}} {{content in}} food {{is not a}} straightforward process, as antioxidants collectively are {{a diverse group of}} compounds with different reactivities to various reactive oxygen species. In food science, the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) was once an industry standard for antioxidant strength <b>of</b> <b>whole</b> foods, juices and food additives. However, the United States Department of Agriculture withdrew these ratings in 2012 as biologically invalid, stating that no physiological proof in vivo existed to support the free-radical theory or roles for ingested phytochemicals, especially for polyphenols. Consequently, the ORAC method, derived only from in vitro experiments, is no longer considered relevant to human diets or biology.|$|E

By 24 October, the rebels were routed, and al-Bakri escaped. He became the target of criticism among other rebel leaders, namely Said al-'As. Al-'As stated that al-Bakri sought personal glory when he decided to prematurely launch a mostly uncoordinated attack with small numbers of armed volunteers, instead of waiting for the arrival of al-Atrash's reinforcements, who numbered around 1,000. Al-Bakri was the only member of the Damascus nationalist elite to directly participate in the fighting on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Seyfert {{galaxies are}} one of the two largest groups of active galaxies, along with quasars. They have quasar-like nuclei (very luminous, distant and bright sources of {{electromagnetic}} radiation) with very high surface brightnesses but unlike quasars, their host galaxies are clearly detectable. Seyfert galaxies account for about 10% of all galaxies. Seen in visible light, most Seyfert galaxies look like normal spiral galaxies, but when studied under other wavelengths, the luminosity of their cores is equivalent to the luminosity <b>of</b> <b>whole</b> galaxies the size of the Milky Way.|$|E
