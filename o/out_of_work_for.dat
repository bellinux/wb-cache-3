5|$|Smith {{was only}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> nine weeks before being {{appointed}} manager of Bristol City on 9 March 1992. He succeeded Jimmy Lumsden, {{who left the}} club second-from-bottom in the Second Division. Smith felt the team lacked pace, so signed 20-year-old striker Andy Cole on loan from Arsenal. Dariusz Dziekanowski scored both goals against Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves) in Smith's second match in charge to provide City with their first win in three months. They then won 3–1 against Smith's former club Sunderland, with Cole scoring {{the first of his}} 8 goals in 12 appearances during his loan spell. Smith successfully steered the club out of the relegation zone at the end of 1992–93 with a run of eight matches unbeaten, and paid a club record £500,000 to secure Cole's services on a permanent basis. He further paid £250,000 for Everton midfielder Raymond Atteveld and signed West Ham United striker Leroy Rosenior.|$|E

In 2010, according to World Bank statistics, 37% of all unemployed women were long-run unemployed workers, or workers who have been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> more than one year.

Pulis immediately {{found himself in a}} relegation battle and it looked likely that the club would be relegated back to the Second Division only a year after being promoted. Pulis, however, completed the signings of striker Ade Akinbiyi and goalkeeper Mark Crossley, on loan from Crystal Palace and Middlesbrough respectively, who helped turn around the club's bad run. Stoke avoided relegation {{on the final day of}} the 2002–03 season with a 1–0 win over Reading at the Britannia Stadium, with Akinbiyi scoring the only goal of the match. Pulis rates Stoke's survival in 2002–03 as one of his best achievements in management.|$|E

And then it was out at the box office about 10 days before it died." [...] When filming was over, she rejoined The Real Thing before being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> six months.

500|$|After {{the first}} NATO supply trucks crossed the Afghan border on 5 June 2012, Pakistanis {{questioned}} the NATO supply line deal.

Imran Khan, another major opposition figure, went further, saying that [...] "the decision isn't only against national interest but can also stir unrest within the ranks of the armed forces." [...] He also criticised the incumbent government as being a pawn of the United States. Political and religious parties in Pakaistan undertook [...] "long march" [...] to Islamabad to protest reopening of supply routes to Afghanistan. Pakistan declared it will scan all NATO containers passing through the country to ensure they do not contain weapons and unapproved items will be seized. 560,000 rupees ($6,000) compensation per vehicle would be paid to the truck owners by NATO subcontractors for being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> seven months because of the blockade according to Rana Mohammad Aslam, vice-president of the All Pakistan Goods Carrier Association.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{he lived with}} fellow actor Jerome Flynn and earned money by signing fan mail for the {{successful}} star of Soldier Soldier. In his debut feature film, Hear My Song (Peter Chelsom, 1991), Nesbitt played Fintan O'Donnell, a struggling theatrical agent and friend of Mickey O'Neill (Adrian Dunbar). A New York Times critic wrote, [...] "the jaunty, bemused Mr. Nesbitt, manages to combine soulfulness with sly humor". The praise he received made him self-assured and complacent; in 2001, he recalled, [...] "When I did Hear My Song, I disappeared so far up my own arse afterwards. I thought, 'Oh, that's it, I've cracked it.' And I'm glad that happened, because you then find out how expendable actors are." [...] His attitude left him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> {{six months after the}} film was released. Until 1994, he mixed his stage roles with supporting roles on television in episodes of Boon, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Covington Cross, Lovejoy, and Between the Lines. In 1993, he appeared in Love Lies Bleeding, an instalment of the BBC anthology series Screenplay and his first appearance in a production directed by Michael Winterbottom; he later appeared in Go Now (1995), Jude (1996) and Welcome to Sarajevo (1997). A Guardian journalist wrote that [...] "he showed himself to be a generous supporting actor" [...] in Jude and Sarajevo.|$|E

In Series 5, Pete suspects that Jo may have married him as a visa scam to stay in Britain. Their relationship is damaged and Jo sleeps with a colleague on a work weekend away. Pete asks her for a divorce when he finds out. Jo was devised when Bullen and Harries wanted Pete {{to fall in love with}} an Australian woman so they could film the Series 4 finale in Sydney. Kimberley Joseph was based in Los Angeles and had been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> 18 months before getting an audition with Spencer Campbell. Two weeks later she had moved to Manchester and was doing read-throughs with the rest of the cast. Joseph thought Bullen had envisioned the character as a coarse [...] "big fat truck-driving lesbian type" [...] before he met her. Thomson thought Pete's lust for Jo was a rebound from Jenny and that, while Jo genuinely liked Pete, she did not actually love him, which Pete suspects when he reads Jo's emails in Series 5, Episode 2.|$|E

Anderson recalled: [...] "First of all, I swore I'd never move to Los Angeles, and once I did, I swore I'd never do television.
