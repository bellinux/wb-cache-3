5|$|Fairman {{discusses}} the efforts <b>of</b> <b>conservatives</b> in the United States to censor {{the word from}} common parlance in the country, and says these acts {{are opposed to the}} First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Fairman warns against a tendency toward self-censorship. He explains that those who choose to silence themselves tacitly encourage a process by which speech is forbidden through the legal process. He argues that this passivity has an impact of increasing the taboo nature of the word.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Machen {{and other}} conservatives founded the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions. A year later, the General Assembly {{declared}} the Independent Board unconstitutional {{and demanded that}} all church members cut ties with it. Machen refused to obey, and his ordination was suspended in 1936. Afterwards, Machen led an exodus <b>of</b> <b>conservatives</b> to form what would be later known as the Orthodox Presbyterian Church.|$|E

5|$|The Communist Party USA was {{routinely}} harassed and {{oppressed by}} government officials, leading {{it to be}} the primary client of the ACLU. The Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal or unethical conduct, and this led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU. Communist leaders often attacked the ACLU, particularly when the ACLU defended the free speech rights <b>of</b> <b>conservatives.</b> This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades.|$|E
5|$|This appeal {{caused a}} {{reaction}} from the opposition forces: Odobescu rallied to the cause <b>of</b> <b>conservatives,</b> and, on July 1, 1848, together with his fellow officers Ioan Solomon and Grigorie Lăcusteanu, arrested the entire Government. The coup almost succeeded, being ultimately overturned by the reaction of Bucharesters, who organized street resistance against mutinied troops, mounted barricades, and, eventually, stormed into the executive's headquarters. The latter assault, led by Ana Ipătescu, resulted in the arrest of all coup leaders.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, Pilcher contested {{the seat}} of Thornbury in the 1918 general election. He opposed the sitting Liberal member Athelstan Rendall, a Coalition Coupon candidate, {{representing}} the splinter right-wing National Party <b>of</b> <b>Conservatives</b> opposed to the Coalition. He was heavily defeated, taking only 38% of the vote in what had previously been a relatively close seat. He continued a loose association with right-wing politics, chairing the anti-Bolshevik National Security Union, and joining the anti-socialist and protectionist British Commonwealth Union. When the British Fascisti was formed in the early 1920s, Pilcher became a member and an official of its London branch.|$|E

5|$|Gay men {{and lesbians}} came {{together}} to work in grassroots political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition <b>of</b> <b>conservatives</b> named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated. Reaction {{to the influence of}} Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Gladstone {{brought forward}} {{legislation}} {{to establish a}} Catholic university in Dublin. This divided the Liberals, and on 12 March an alliance <b>of</b> <b>Conservatives</b> and Irish Catholics defeated the government by three votes. Gladstone resigned, and the Queen sent for Disraeli, who refused to take office. Without a general election, a Conservative government would be another minority, dependent for survival on the division of its opponents. Disraeli wanted the power a majority would bring, and felt he could gain it later by leaving the Liberals in office now. Gladstone's government struggled on, beset by scandal and unimproved by a reshuffle. As part of that change, Gladstone took on the office of Chancellor, leading to questions {{as to whether he}} had to stand for re-election on taking on a second ministry—until the 1920s, MPs becoming ministers, thus taking an office of profit under the Crown, had to seek re-election.|$|E

Recent Arbitron polls have shown that the vast majority <b>of</b> <b>conservative</b> talk radio station listeners are males over the age of 54, with less than 10 percent of the listener base aged 35 to 54. It is also shown that less than one tenth of one percent <b>of</b> <b>conservative</b> talk radio listeners participate (or call in) to the hosts to make comments.

25|$|The changes {{affected}} {{the nature of}} candidates chosen. Under Butt, the party's MPs were a mixture of Catholic and Protestant, landlord and others, Whig, Liberal and Conservative, often leading to disagreements in policy that meant that MPs split in votes. Under Parnell, the number of Protestant and landlord MPs dwindled, as did the number <b>of</b> <b>Conservatives</b> seeking election. The parliamentary party became much more Catholic and middle class, {{with a large number}} of journalists and lawyers elected and the disappearance of Protestant Ascendancy landowners and Conservatives from it.|$|E

50|$|The diminished {{population}} of United Synagogue <b>of</b> <b>Conservative</b> Judaism and its congregations {{is seen by}} many as a symptom of a weak organizational culture in the United Synagogue <b>of</b> <b>Conservative</b> Judaism itself. A strategic plan undertaken in the 1990s was squelched when the report challenged many of the United Synagogue <b>of</b> <b>Conservative</b> Judaism's practices. In 2010, dissension reached the point at which a coalition known as Hayom ("Today") was formed and threatened to break away from United Synagogue <b>of</b> <b>Conservative</b> Judaism if significant changes were not undertaken. The creation of this coalition was in part a response to a restructuring announced by the new executive director, Rabbi Steven Wernick, without input from the field. A new strategic planning committee was formed, co-opting the Hayom group, and in March 2011 a draft of a new plan was announced and posted on the United Synagogue <b>of</b> <b>Conservative</b> Judaism website.|$|R
