60|$|The hilly {{country in}} the middle of the north edge of Sussex, looking very {{pleasant}} on a fine evening at the end of September, is seen through the windows of a room which has been built so as to resemble the after part of an old-fashioned high-pooped ship, with a stern gallery; for the windows are ship built with heavy timbering, and run right across the room as continuously as the stability of the wall allows. A row of lockers under the windows provides an unupholstered windowseat interrupted by twin glass doors, respectively halfway between the stern post and the sides. Another door strains the illusion a little by being apparently in the ship's port side, and yet leading, not to the open sea, but to the entrance hall of the house. Between this door and the stern gallery are bookshelves. There are electric light switches beside the door leading to the hall and the glass doors in the stern gallery. Against the starboard wall is a carpenter's bench. The vice has a board in its jaws; and the floor is littered with shavings, <b>overflowing</b> from a <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket.</b> A couple of planes and a centrebit are on the bench. In the same wall, between the bench and the windows, is a narrow doorway with a half door, above which a glimpse of the room beyond shows that it is a shelved pantry with bottles and kitchen crockery.|$|R
60|$|The last sheet fluttered in two {{sections}} into the surfeited <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket.</b>|$|R
60|$|Brooks {{crumpled}} {{the letter}} up {{and flung it}} into the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket.</b>|$|R

60|$|A {{peculiar}} smile lingered for {{a moment}} on Julius's face. He threw the letter into the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket.</b>|$|R
60|$|TANNER. [diving at the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket</b> {{and fishing}} the book out for her] Then read {{it at once}} and decide.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{the door}} was closed behind him, Arthur went to the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket</b> {{and took out the}} little pink silk handkerchief.|$|R
60|$|JAWBONES I'll tell yer when I want yer to {{open the}} window and call for the p'lice. You can throw them into the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket.</b>|$|R
60|$|He read {{it through}} aloud; then threw the {{scribbled}} sheet into the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket</b> {{and got into}} bed again. In a very few minutes he was asleep.|$|R
60|$|He {{found he}} was still holding the torn fragments. He {{stretched}} {{out his hand and}} dropped them into that new <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket</b> Ethel had bought for him.|$|R
60|$|I {{will only}} add that when Mr. Ashurst left, I copied the will out neatly, without erasures. The rough {{original}} I threw (somewhat carelessly) into the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket.</b>|$|R
60|$|Maraton {{struck a}} vesta {{and handed it}} to him. Selingman {{transferred}} the flame to a piece of paper from the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket</b> and puffed contentedly at his cigar.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Hermione at length. 'His {{mother was}} Italian. She {{was born in}} my <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket</b> in Florence, {{on the morning of}} Rupert's {{birthday}}. She was his birthday present.' ...|$|R
60|$|Her face denied it; {{the look}} of {{suffering}} was there still. She tore up the letter which she had been writing, and threw the fragments into the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket.</b>|$|R
60|$|With {{a gesture}} of horror and disgust Mr. Bodiham threw the {{catalogue}} into the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket.</b> Mrs. Bodiham looked at him; her pale, glaucous eyes reflected his action without comment.|$|R
6000|$|But BILL and HAROLD, {{followed}} by LATTER, {{are already in}} the [...] doorway. They come in, and LATTER, stumbling over the [...] <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket,</b> takes it up to improve its position.|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate, I don't {{throw them}} into a <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket.</b> If {{destruction}} is their doomed lot, they perish worthily, and are burnt on a pyre, as Dido was of old." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Chief {{could have}} avoided it by a judicious {{use of the}} <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket</b> and an {{exercise}} of the gift of silence." [...] Tallente retorted, as the young man took his departure.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{gives us}} two {{votes for the}} army," [...] remarked MacShaughnassy, as Brown tore his sister's letter in two, and threw the pieces into the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket.</b> [...] "What says the common-sensed girl?" ...|$|R
60|$|The first {{which he}} {{happened}} to take up was addressed to him in Mrs. Presty's handwriting. His opinion of this correspondent was expressed in prompt action--he threw the letter, unopened, into the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr Ferguson {{kicked the}} <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket</b> savagely. The {{unfairness}} {{of the thing}} hurt him. A sacked office-boy ought to stay sacked. He had no business to come popping up again like Banquo's ghost. It was not playing the game.|$|R
60|$|I {{wonder whether}} the {{foregoing}} pages of my writing-paper have been torn to pieces and thrown into the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket?</b> You wouldn't litter the carpet. No. I may be torn in pieces, but I do you justice for all that.|$|R
5000|$|J. W. Spear and Sons was a {{significant}} manufacturer of board games during the 20th century. The company was founded by Jacob Wolf Spier (1832-1893) in FÃ¼rth, near Nuremberg, Germany in 1879, producing goods such as table mats, photo frames, and <b>waste-paper</b> <b>baskets.</b>|$|R
60|$|Louis {{knew where}} that letter was, for having seen {{it on her}} desk he had, without reading it, torn it up and thrown it into the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket,</b> {{thinking}} the less that remained to remind her of the young philosopher the better.|$|R
60|$|Then shall he {{cast that}} bonny book of thine Where the extreme <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket</b> gapes, There shall thy futile fancies peak and pine, With other minor poets, pallid shapes, Who {{come a long}} way short of the divine, Tormented souls of {{imitative}} apes.|$|R

Cradle?--Cradle--[She viciously dumps a <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket</b> down, and drops a {{footstool}} into it] Brat! [Then {{reading from the}} book gloomily] [...] "Enter Eccles breathless. Esther and Polly rise-Esther puts on lid of bandbox." [...] Bandbox! ...|$|R
60|$|He {{came down}} and went into his study and lit his reading lamp, a patent affair with an {{incandescent}} wick, dropping the match into his <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket</b> without stopping {{to see if it}} was extinguished. Then he fretted into the dining-room and began a desultory attack on the cooling dinner....|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least. Personally, I am {{not at all}} busy. Three-quarters of our business, you see, {{is merely}} a matter of routine. I was just going to shut myself up here and read the Times. Have a cigarette? Here's an {{envelope}} opener and a <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket.</b> Make yourself comfortable." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hanging up {{the gray}} top hat, {{he went in}} search of her. He found her in his dressing-room, {{surrounded}} by a number of little bottles, which she was examining vaguely, and putting one by one into an 'inherited' <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket.</b> Having watched her for a little while with a certain pleasure, he said: ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{took up the}} General's letter, {{without waiting}} for permission; tore it to pieces, smiling pleasantly all the while; and threw the {{fragments}} into the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket.</b> [...] "As if you didn't know better than I do!" [...] she said, kissing him on the forehead. [...] "Engage the man by all means." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The covey told me {{you were}} a charwoman; so I suppose you picked the {{envelopes}} out of <b>waste-paper</b> <b>baskets,</b> or such like, and then changed the addresses?' She nods again; still she dare not look up, but she is admiring his legs. When, however, he would cast the letters into the fire, she flames up with sudden spirit. She clutches them.|$|R
6000|$|A {{very common}} way with these petitioners {{is to begin}} with a fine flummery about the merits and eminent genius of the person whom they are addressing. But this artifice, I state publicly, is of no avail. When I see THAT kind of herb, I know the snake within it, and fling it away before it has time to sting. Away, reptile, to the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket,</b> and thence to the flames! ...|$|R
6000|$|One {{object that}} she noticed in it caused her some little surprise--not unmingled with disgust. She {{discovered}} on the toilet-table a coarsely caricatured portrait of Mrs. Ellmother. It was a sketch in pencil--wretchedly drawn; but spitefully successful as a likeness. [...] "I didn't {{know you were}} an artist," [...] Emily remarked, with an ironical emphasis on the last word. Francine laughed scornfully--crumpled the drawing up in her hand--and threw it into the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall we open it at once?" [...] inquired the artist, who {{had grown}} decidedly cheerful under the {{combined}} effects of company and gin; and without waiting for a reply, he began to strip as if for a prize-fight, tossed his clerical collar in the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket,</b> hung his clerical coat upon a nail, and with a chisel {{in one hand and}} a hammer in the other, struck the first blow of the evening.|$|R
60|$|The {{first letter}} that Harry opened and listlessly glanced through with his {{experienced}} eye {{was one of}} the staple Monitor kind--Stella or Euphemia had quarrelled, in a moment of pique, with her lover, and was now dying of anxiety to regain his affections. Harry scribbled a few words of kindly chaff and sound advice in reply upon a blank sheet of virgin foolscap, and tossed the torn fragments of letter number one into the capacious mouth of his <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} so much," [...] he replied, [...] "that I {{know it is}} {{hard for}} you to speak. There are bonds which you have made sacred, and your fingers shrink from tearing them asunder. If it were not for this, Philippa--hear the speech of a renegade--my mandate should be torn in pieces. My instructions should flutter into the <b>waste-paper</b> <b>basket,</b> To-morrow should see us on our way to a new country and a new life. But you must be very sure indeed." ...|$|R
