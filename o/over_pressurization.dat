The purpose of the test series {{was to determine the}} effect of elevating the temperature of the pressurant gas on the performance of a liquid acquisition device (LAD). Three fine mesh screen samples (325 x 2300, 450 x 2750, 510 x 3600) were tested in liquid hydrogen and liquid nitrogen using cold and warm non-condensable (gaseous helium) and condensable (gaseous hydrogen or nitrogen) pressurization schemes. Gases were conditioned from 0 K - 90 K above the liquid temperature. Results clearly indicate degradation in bubble point pressure using warm gas, with a greater reduction in performance using condensable <b>over</b> non-condensable <b>pressurization.</b> Degradation in the bubble point pressure is inversely proportional to screen porosity, as the coarsest mesh demonstrated the highest degradation. Results here have implication on both pressurization and LAD system design for all future cryogenic propulsion systems.

40|$|Pressure-induced amorphization (PIA) is a {{phenomenon}} that involves an abrupt transition between a crystalline material and an amorphous solid through application of pressure at temperatures well below the melting point or glass transition range. Amorphous states can be produced by PIA for substances that do not normally form glasses by thermal quenching. It was first reported for ice Ih in 1984 following prediction of a metastable melting event associated with the negative initial melting slope observed for that material. The unusual phenomenon attracted intense interest and by the early 1990 s PIA had been reported to occur among {{a wide range of}} elements and compounds. However, with the advent of powerful experimental techniques including high resolution synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering combined with more precise control <b>over</b> the <b>pressurization</b> environment, closer examination showed that some of the effects previously reported as PIA were likely due to formation of nanocrystals, or even that PIA was completely bypassed during examination of single crystals or materials treated under more hydrostatic compression conditions. Now {{it is important to understand}} these results together with related discussions of polyamorphic behavior to gain better understanding and control over these metastable transformations occurring in the low temperature range where structural relaxation and equilibration processes are severely constrained. The results will lead to useful new high-density amorphous materials or nanocrystalline composites containing metastable crystalline varieties and the experiments have driven new theoretical approaches to modeling the phenomena. Here we review the incidence and current understanding of PIA along with related phenomena of density- and entropy-driven liquid-liquid phase transitions (LLPT) and polyamorphism. We extend the discussion to include polymeric macromolecules and biologically-related materials, where the phenomena can be correlated with reversible vs irreversible unfolding and other metastable structural transformations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract:Although {{compressor}} blades {{have long}} been shrouded for aerodynamic and structural reasons, {{the importance of the}} <b>pressurization</b> <b>over</b> the cascade in the axial compressor stage is being investigated. However, the effects of the leakage tangential velocity variation on the blade passage flow are unknown. An experimental investigation of the loss and flow turning in the blade passage in shrouded axial compressor cascades subject to the variation of the leakage tangential velocity. First, increasing the leakage tangential velocity reduces overall loss. Second, increasing the leakage tangential velocity spreads loss core in the pitch-wise direction so loss core becomes more two-dimensional. Third, increasing the leakage tangential velocity makes the near hub passage flow more radially uniform. Our research predicts the streamline contour occurred at the Rotor Root-Stator Tip to predict the variation of flow. Research over selected series of airfoil at angle of 22 ° at the Root, 4 ° at the Tip and vice versa is being predicted using Computational Tools. The Aim is to identify the convergence criteria at lowest possible values of iterations. Based on the design data the approach is being done using ANSYS CFX to perform computational results...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of intravascular ultrasound imaging for characterizing regional arterial elasticity was examined in an experimental tissue-equivalent vessel model. Differential intrawall displacement meas-urement, {{the first step}} in regional elasticity determination, was investigated using a crosscorrelation tracking algorithm. Calibration studies showed that tracking accuracy varied significantly with tracking direction (axial versus lateral) and position in the field of the transducer. Midfield geometric error in the axial direction for anominal displacement of 100 pm was 5. 5 p n whereas the corresponding error in the lateral direction was 31. 7 pm. Displacement was tracked in serial intravascular images of vessel phan-toms acquired during stepwise pressurization experiments from 0 - 250 mmHg. Two-dimensional grey scale maps of axial, lateral and net intrawall displacement components <b>over</b> the full <b>pressurization</b> range were generated. Displacement profiles demonstrated successful detection of differential radial dis-placement and good correlation with theoretical profiles (root mean square difference 3 %). The corre-sponding experimental strain profiles were significantly noisier (root mean square difference 76 %) due to small fluctuations in the displacement data. This work demonstrates that, with further refinement, re-gional strain mapping in vessel walls with intravascular ultrasound imaging is feasible. Mechanical characterization of arteries may provide a new tool to aid in assessing and treating atherosclerotic le-sions.

50|$|A rupture disc, {{also known}} as a burst disc, {{bursting}} disc, or burst diaphragm, is a onetime use, non-reclosing pressure relief device that, in most uses, protects a pressure vessel, equipment or system from <b>over</b> <b>pressurization</b> or potentially damaging vacuum conditions. A rupture disc is a sacrificial part because it has a one-time-use membrane that fails at a predetermined differential pressure, either positive or vacuum. The membrane is usually made out of metal, but nearly any material can be used to suit a particular application. Rupture discs provide instant response (within milliseconds) to an increase or decrease in system pressure, but once the disc has ruptured it will not reseal. Due to the one time usage of this disc it requires someone to replace the plate once it has ruptured. One time usage devices are initially cost effective, but can become time consuming and labor-intensive to repeatedly change out.|$|E
40|$|Potentially low lithospheric densities, {{caused by}} high Venus surface and perhaps mantle temperatures, could inhibit the {{development}} of negative buoyancy-driven subduction and a global system of plate tectonics/crustal recycling on that planet. No evidence for a global plate tectonic system was found so far, however, specific features strongly resembling terrestrial subduction zones in planform and topographic cross-section were described, including trenches around large coronae and chasmata in eastern Aphrodite Terra. The cause for the absence, or an altered expression, of plate tectonics on Venus remains to be found. Slab buoyancy {{may play a role}} in this difference, with higher lithospheric temperatures and a tendency toward positive buoyancy acting to oppose the descent of slabs and favoring under thrusting instead. The effect of slab buoyancy on subduction was explored and the conditions which would lead to under thrusting versus those allowing the formation of trenches and self-perpetuating subduction were defined. Applying a finite element code to assess the effects of buoyant forces on slabs subducting into a viscous mantle, it was found that mantle flow induced by horizontal motion of the convergent lithosphere greatly influences subduction angle, while buoyancy forces produce a lesser effect. Induced mantle flow tends to decrease subduction angle to near an under thrusting position when the subducting lithosphere converges on a stationary overriding lithosphere. When the overriding lithosphere is in motion, as in the case of an expanding corona, subduction angles are expected to increase. An initial stage involved estimating the changes in slab buoyancy due to slab healing and <b>pressurization</b> <b>over</b> the course of subduction. Modeling a slab, descending at a fixed angle and heated by conduction, radioactivity, and the heat released in phase changes, slab material density changes due to changing temperature, phase, and pressure were derived...|$|R
40|$|The {{radioactive}} material confinement {{in a nuclear}} power plant (NPP),, is a fundamental safety function to be ensured during a design basis accident (DBA). For plant licensing analysis, the containment is usually modeled with a lumped parameter approach. The assumption that within each region the fluid is well mixed is inherent to this approach. However, the containment is a large building with a complex configuration. It is distributed in several compartments that avoid the well mixing of the fluid and that provoke three-dimensional effects that affect the thermal–hydraulic behavior. Reactors like Trillo NPP are highly compartmentalized {{in order to reduce the}} dose to the personnel, in contrast with PWR-W reactors that present a more diaphanous layout. Accordingly, this kind of reactors are more liable to have three dimensional effects and/or local differences than a PWR-W. The collaborative project between the UPM and CNAT has enabled the development of highly detailed three-dimensional models of the Trillo NPP containment building. The objective of this study is the detailed 3 D thermal-hydraulic analysis during a mass and energy release where local effects can be observed. Most of DBA analysis are performed using lumped-parameters models which only allow to know the average containment state, and that has several assumptions related with 0 D models. For this reason a generic double-ended LBLOCA is simulated in a GOTHIC 3 D model in order to study the local phenomenology occurring during this kind of transient. Analyzing the results, an homogeneous <b>pressurization</b> <b>over</b> the whole containment can be observed, with the exception of the rooms near the break. This is predictable given that pressure is transmitted at the speed of sound. However, temperature evolution is different between compartments. Temperature behavior obeys to convective-diffusive processes, and it presents strong differences between compartments that cannot be seen with lumped parameters models. The steam residence time becomes one of the critical parameters in the containment thermal behavior, and this is strongly dependent on the building geometry...|$|R

40|$|The {{emission}} of fuel vapors {{into the atmosphere}} from underground storage tanks at filling stations is a common occurrence in many parts the world. The conditions of the vapor in the tanks vary significantly over a 24 hour period such that evaporation and excess air ingestion during the refueling process can cause tank <b>over</b> <b>pressurization</b> and subsequent emissions. At other times during a 24 hour cycle, pressures can fall below atmospheric pressure. The state of California has recognized this emissions problem and has enacted regulations to address it. Due to these low-emission environmental requirements in California, solutions must be implemented that do not entail release of these vapors into the atmosphere. One solution requires that the vapors fill a balloon during the appropriate times. However, {{the size of the}} balloon at typical inflation rates requires a significant amount of physical space (approximately 1000 - 2000 liters), which may not necessarily be available at filling stations in urban areas. Veeder-Root has a patent pending for a system to compress the vapors that are released to a 10 : 1 ratio, store this compressed vapor in a small storage tank, and then return the vapors to the original underground fuel tank when the conditions are thermodynamically appropriate (see Figure 1 for the schematic representation of this system). The limitation of the compressor, however, is that the compression phase must take place below the ignition temperature of the vapor. For a 10 : 1 compression ratio, however, the adiabatic temperature rise of a vapor would be above the ignition temperature. Mathematical modeling is necessary here to estimate the performance of the compressor, and to suggest paths in design for improvement. This report starts with a mathematical formulation of an ideal compressor, and uses the anticipated geometry of the compressor to state a simplified set of partial differential equations. The adiabatic case is then considered, assuming that the temporary storage tank is kept at a constant temperature. Next, the heat transfer from the compression chamber through the compressor walls is incorporated into the model. Finally, we consider the case near the valve wall, which is subject to the maximum temperature rise over the estimated 10, 000 cycles that will be necessary for the process to occur.

The problem of modeling deep saline formation pressurization has been approached {{in a number of different}} ways by researchers, with published analytical and numerical solutions showing a wide range of outcomes. The divergence of results (either supporting or negating the pressurization issue) principally reflects the a priori choice of boundary conditions. These approaches can be summed up as either ‘open’ or ‘closed’: (a) open system models allow the formation pressure to dissipate laterally, resulting in reasonable storage scenarios; (b) closed system models predict pressurization, resulting in a loss of injectivity and/or storage formation leakage. The latter scenario predicts that storage sites will commonly fail to accommodate the injected CO 2 at a rate sufficient to handle routine projects. Our models aim to demonstrate that pressurization and brine displacement need to be addressed at a regional scale with geologically accurate boundary conditions. Given that storage formations are unlikely to have zero-flow boundaries (closed system assumption), the boundary contribution to pressure relief from low permeability shales may be significant. At a field scale, these shales are effectively perfect seals with respect to multiphase flow, but are open with respect to single phase flow and pressure dissipation via brine displacement at a regional scale. This is sometimes characterized as a ‘semi-closed’ system. It follows that the rate at which pressure can be dissipated (and CO 2 injected) is highly sensitive to the shale permeability. A common range from sub-millidarcy (10 − 17  m 2) to sub-nanodarcy (10 − 22  m 2) is considered, and the empirical relationships of permeability with respect to porosity and threshold pressure are reviewed in light of the regional scale of CO 2 storage in deep saline formations. Our model indicates that a boundary permeability of about a microdarcy (10 − 18  m 2) is likely to provide sufficient pressure dissipation via brine displacement to allow for routine geological storage. The models also suggest that nanodarcy shales (10 − 21  m 2) will result in significant pressurization. There is regional evidence, from the North Sea, that typical shale permeabilities at depths associated with CO 2 storage (1 – 3  km) are likely to favor storage, relegating pressurization to a manageable issue...|$|E
40|$|Many of the {{mechanical}} equipment failures at the Laboratory are due {{to the loss of}} cooling water. In order to insure the proper operating temperatures and to increase the reliability of {{the mechanical}} equipment in the D 0 Cryo Utilities Room it is necessary to provide an independent liquid cooling system. To this end, an enclosed glycoVwater cooling system which transfers heat from two vane-type vacuum pumps and an air compressor to the outside air has been installed in the Cryo Utilities Room. From the appended list {{it can be seen that}} only the Thermal Precision PFC- 121 -D and Ingersoll-Rand WAC 16 deserve closer investigation based on price. The disadvantages of the WAC 16 are that: it runs a little warmer, it requires more valving to properly install a backup pump, inlet and outlet piping are not included, and temperature and pressure indicators are not included. Its only advantage is that it is $ 818 cheaper than the PFC- 121 -D. The advantages of the PFC- 121 -D are that: it has automatic pump switching during shutdown, it has a temperature regulator on one fan control, it has a switch which indicates proper operation, has a sight glass on the expansion tank, and comes with an ASME approved expansion tank and relief valve. For these reasons the Thermal Precision PFC- 121 -D was chosen. In the past, we have always found the pond water to be muddy and to sometimes contain rocks of greater than 1 / 2 inch diameter. Thus a system completely dependent on the pond water from the accelerator was deemed unacceptable. A closed system was selected based on its ability to greatly improve reliability, while remaining economical. It is charged with a 50 / 50 glycol/water mixture capable of withstanding outside temperatures down to - 33 F. The fluid will be circulated by a totally enclosed air cooled Thermal Precision PFC- 121 -D pump. The system will be on emergency power and an automatically controlled backup pump, identical to the primary, is available should the main pump fail. The fan unit is used as a primary cooler and the trim cooler cools the fluid further on extremely hot days. The trim cooler has also been sized to cool the system in the event of a total shutdown provided that the pond water supply has adequate pressure. Due to a broken filter, we found it necessary to install a strainer in the pond water supply line. The expansion tank separates air bubbles, ensures a net positive suction head, protects against surges and <b>over</b> <b>pressurization</b> of the system, and allows for the filling of the system without shutting it off. All piping has been installed, flushed, charged with the glycol/water mix, and hydrostatically tested to 55 psi. The condition of all pumps and flow conditions will be recorded at the PLC. It has been decided not to include the regulator valve in the pond water return line. This valve was designated by the manufacturer to reduce the amount of water flowing through the trim cooler. This is not necessary in our application. There is some concern that the cooling fluid may cool the mechanical eqUipment too much when they are not operating or during very cold days. This issue will be addressed and the conclusion appended to this engineering note...|$|E
