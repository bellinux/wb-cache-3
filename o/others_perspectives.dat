40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on an {{internship}} at Södertälje Municipality. During three weeks I have observed and interviewed the environmental strategists in order to understand their view on communication. I have also dug deeper into one of the projects to get a better understanding of their work. Most of the strategists’ out-turning projects are based on a classical communication model where {{the focus is on the}} sender and on the messages they want to deliver. This model does not take the receivers perspective into account and is therefore difficult to use when trying to changes people’s behavior. According to for example McKenzie-Mohr and Nitsch, it is important with communication in order to make a change and take the target group’s perspective. During my time in Södertälje I have realized that there are several barriers for not communicating. Time constrains, resources and lack of knowledge are some factors which make this work difficult. With some more efforts on communication in the environmental strategists’ work in Södertälje they can though be able to take <b>others</b> <b>perspectives,</b> get feedback and hopefully give people the tools to change behavior and act in a more sustainable way...|$|E
40|$|Understanding basic {{cultural}} differences and developing sensitivity towards such differences {{are essential to}} success in the current global business context. Given the enormous (current and projected) {{rise in the number}} and nature of connections between Australian and Indian business, it is imperative that these two nations understand and adapt to each other’s cultures to succeed. In this paper, I overview the current status of work examining the Australian and Indian business communication context, and argue that more work is needed, and will prove highly beneficial to future trade relations between these two nations. It is foreseen that such research could provide insight into current communication occurring in this specific intercultural business context, and has the potential to offer suggestions and tactics to future business professionals to cope with {{cultural differences}}. The resulting findings can also prove beneficial to Australian and Indian business professionals to learn more about cultural adaptation from each <b>others</b> <b>perspectives.</b> Research findings could also enable identification of the barriers to, and catalysts of, engagement in Australia-India business relations and exchange.

40|$|The biomass of the {{algal bloom}} of Sargassum polycystum along the lagoon shores of Funafuti Atoll (Tuvalu) was {{estimated}} in November 2014 using a multispectral spaceborne Pleiades image and concurrent field data. Field work established (1) the geographical {{limit of the}} distribution of the algae in the lagoon, (2) the different types of S. polycystum beds that developed in the lagoon, and (3) the range of biomass per square meter for 12 stations. Extrapolation of field data using the green spectral band of the image over the distribution domain and manual correction to remove outliers suggested a standing biomass of 852 t of wet biomass (+/- 95 % confidence interval = 420 - 1747 t) over 0. 74 km(2) of reef. Six months later, the processing of a Pleiades image from April 2015 suggested a decrease of algal biomass by 17 % (710 +/- 333 - 1542 t). The examination of a multi-sensor series of very high-resolution multispectral images (acquired in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015) suggested that algal proliferation started in 2010, with a strong unambiguous signal 1 year later in 2011.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 In {{an effort}} to {{supplement}} the recently completed NOAA fishing community profiles, three coastal Oregon communities were chosen as sites for a collaborative project designed to produce long-form profiles. In order to provide {{a representation of the}} coast Newport, Port Orford, and Garibali, Oregon were included based on community size, fishery types, and gear types. Community researchers from each community along with social scientists at Oregon State University teamed up to collect ethnographic data not included in the already existing profiles. The community researchers were trained in interviewing techniques, conducting the bulk of the 64 interviews completed by the project. Community researchers interviewed their own peers in their communities in addition to being involved in all aspects of the project. Three long-form community profiles were produced. These profiles include information on the importance of fishing to each community, characteristics of fishermen, descriptions of fishing families and how they have changed over time, support services for fishing and connections to other communities, communication within the fishing community and with <b>others,</b> <b>perspectives</b> on management and effects of management actions, changes in the economics of fishing and seafood and changes in fishing effort, perceptions {{of the state of the}} ocean and its resources, and perceptions of the future of fishing in each location.

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} ways that intersubjective {{experiences}} were evident during the social interactions {{that took place in}} two Australian infant and toddler early childhood classrooms. In philosophical terms, the word experience has traditionally been used to refer to individual perspectives; to perceptions, feelings, desires and thoughts that make up the private, inner life of an individual. When viewed this way, experience is subjective and personal, either in the form of introspective reasoning about, or the embodied experience of being in, the real world. The viewpoint advanced in this chapter contrasts with individualistic notions of experience to suggest that perspectives are not necessarily as private as some standpoints would have us believe. My starting point is the theoretical ideas of George Herbert Mead (1863 – 1931), who argued that by virtue of membership of a social group and associated, collective social practices, perspectives are regularly expressed and perceived during social interactions with others (Mead, Mind, self and society. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1934). In other words, during engagement in sociocultural, joint activities, individuals orient themselves to one another leading to an intersection of first person (individual) and third person (<b>others)</b> <b>perspectives</b> (Rochat, Others in mind: Social origins of self-consciousness. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2009). In this chapter, I present data from two observational studies of infants, toddlers and their teachers to analyse the interpersonal and intersubjective dimensions of their experiences. I develop the argument that, when individual perspectives are expressed, interpreted and exchanged, infants and toddlers participate in the kinds of shared experiences that build a sense of togetherness and community within their classroom. 13 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The Milošević Trial - An Autopsy {{provides}} a cross-disciplinary examination {{of one of}} the most controversial war crimes trials of the modern era and its contested legacy for the growing fields of international criminal law and post-conflict justice. The international trial of Slobodan Milošević, who presided over the violent collapse of Yugoslavia - was already among the longest war crimes trials when Milošević died in 2006. Yet precisely because it ended without judgment, its significance and legacy are specially contested. The contributors to this volume, including trial participants, area specialists, and international law scholars bring a variety of perspectives as they examine the meaning of the trial 2 ̆ 7 s termination and its implications for post-conflict justice. The book 2 ̆ 7 s approach is intensively cross-disciplinary, weighing the implications for law, politics, and society that modern war crimes trials create. The time for such an examination is fitting, with the imminent closing of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal and rising debates over its legacy, as well as the 20 th anniversary of the outbreak of the Yugoslav conflict. The Milošević Trial - An Autopsy brings thought-provoking insights into the impact of war crimes trials on post-conflict justice. This is the first cross-disciplinary examination {{of one of the}} longest, most controversial war crimes trials of the modern era and its contested legacy for the growing fields of international criminal law and post-conflict justice. Three distinct types of author are brought together in this volume, addressing the interests of three distinct audiences: Actual trial participants, including members of the defense and prosecution; leading scholars of international criminal law; and area studies experts, the last including voices from the former Yugoslavia. This volume incorporates law, political science, history and <b>others</b> <b>perspectives,</b> placing the trial and its impact in broader context relevant to thinkers and policymakers interested not only in the wars in Yugoslavia, but their practical lessons for other conflicts and other courts.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{a project}} that is contributing {{to a change in}} the way of teaching and learning Mathematics. Mathematics is a subject of the Accounting and Administration course. In this subject we teach: Functions and Algebra. The aim is that the students understand the basic concepts and is able to apply them in other issues, when possible, establishing a bridge between the issues that they have studied and their application in Accounting. As from this year, the Accounting course falls under in Bologna Process. The teacher and the student roles have changed. The time for theoretical and practical classes has been reduced, so it was necessary to modify the way of teaching and learning. In the theoretical classes we use systems of multimedia projection to present the concepts, and in the practical classes we solve exercises. To supplement our theoretical and practical classes we have developed an active mathematics project called MatActiva based on the Moodle platform offered by PAOL - Projecto de Apoio Online (Online Support Project). In the last versions of Moodle, it is possible use the TeX language to create math questions. Using this tool we created a set of interactive materials. With the creation of this new project we wanted to take advantage already obtained results with the previous experiences, giving to the students opportunities to complement their study in Mathematics. One of the great objectives is to motivate students, encourage them to overcome theirs difficulties through an auto-study, giving them more confidence and the opportunity to seeing <b>others</b> <b>perspectives</b> of the mathematics subjects. In the MatActiva project the students have a big collection of information about the way of the subject works, which includes the objectives, the program, recommended bibliography, evaluation method and summaries. It works as material support for the practical and theoretical classes, the slides of the theoretical classes are available, the sheets with exercises for the students to do in the classroom and complementary exercises, as well as the exams of previous years. Students can also do diagnostic tests and evaluation tests online. Our approach is a reflexive one, based on the professional experience of the teachers that explore and incorporate new tools of Moodle with their students and coordinate the project MatActiva...|$|E

40|$|This study {{built on}} {{previous}} {{research in the}} area of peer-led literature discussion. Even though there are numerous studies investigating this type of literacy activity, little is known about Taiwanese elementary students??? participation in peer-led literature discussion. This study explored a group of six Taiwanese fourth graders??? participation in peer-led literature discussion in an out-of-classroom context. Specifically, it examined (a) how the participants co-constructed meaning of texts, (b) how the participants interact with one another, (c) what problems the participants encountered, and (d) how the teacher-researcher facilitate the discussions. The study was conducted in the Shuang-Cheng Elementary school, Xindian, New Taipei City, Taiwan. Qualitative research method was adopted. Since this study attempted to explore and understand the reality of literature discussion led by the participants, data collection primarily focused on the participants??? conversation and interactions. Data sources included the researcher logs, the videotaped literature discussions, the participants??? notes, and the interviews with the participants. The data collection took place during an eighteen-week period. The participants entered this study with no prior experience with student-led literature discussion. Also, they were accustomed to obeying commands from people in positions of authority and seldom had opportunities to express their ideas in class. Findings of this study suggest that with preparatory instruction and the researcher???s facilitation, the participants were able to manage their discussions in which communication and interaction skills were needed, to resolve problems collaboratively with a variety of sources, and to apply reading comprehension strategies to interpret the selected texts. In the process of meaning negotiation, they shared different ways of thinking, listened to views of others, valued ideas different from their own, advocated their own beliefs, and showed an understanding of <b>others???</b> <b>perspectives.</b> Within this discussion group, reading became a purposeful meaning-constructing activity in which they developed multiple interpretations, mediated understanding of social issues, and promoted reasoning skills. Even though peer-led literature discussion provided the participants with opportunities to express themselves and required them to take more responsibility for their own learning. Nevertheless, this study suggests that the participants face some challenges when moving from a teacher-directed structure to a more student-centered learning context. The transition to a student-directed discussion format is not easy. The study reported here offers a look at how I, as a facilitator, prepared the participants for the discussions and what continual support I offered when they operated their own discussions...|$|E
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{research}} is to analyze the perception of teachers in applying teaching methods while teaching Islamic History subject in a Teacher Training College and two Madrasas (one male and one female) in Kabul city. The aim is {{to find out if the}} subject of history is taught as per the ministry of education (MoE) teaching rules and regulations. Moreover, the purpose of teaching at these institutes and the common problems faced by them are also investigated. In order to answer these questions, a questionnaire was designed and distributed among 100 History teachers from Sayed Jamal-u-Din Teacher Training College and its relevant 14 districts Teacher Training Colleges and mentioned Madrasas in Kabul city that follows the same curriculum and textbooks. After collecting the questionnaires, 75 % response rate was achieved. The output of the survey was arranged in categories in excel sheet based on three main research questions. Then, some tables were designed for presenting the frequencies and the percentages of the data and later it was used for the analysis collected data. Being explicit about teaching a subject makes it more interesting and motivates the students to learn it for a reason. As a result, recalling it is easier for learners. Therefore, it is very important for teachers to share the purpose of history with their students. Regarding the methods, the most common approach preferred by teachers was to lecture. Though lecture is not avoidable but it is under criticism for being biased and one way of transferring the data. In addition, there is no opportunity for students to share their experiences, ideas and the knowledge they have achieved from the lessons. There are other methods mentioned by teachers such as group work, discussion and students seminars, which are based on constructive approach. These methods expect students to be active and discuss and debate different issues and topics relevant to the lesson and at the same time observe the same phenomena from <b>others</b> <b>perspectives</b> as well. According to experienced teachers, the most common barriers in teaching Islamic History was tick textbooks as well as Arabic nature of Islamic History has mixed a lot of Arabic words into Dari version of text book. As a result, understanding the lessons becomes hard for students bearing in mind that difficult words and spelling mistakes adds up to this problem. TEM...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Compassionate {{caring and}} dignity are key {{priorities}} in current policy and research agendas and {{are central to}} the quality of experience for patients, families and staff. Developing relationships has been identified as a key component in enabling excellence in caring to be realised in practice. However {{there is little evidence that}} identifies the processes involved in delivering compassionate relationship-centred care. This study sought to address this gap in the knowledge base. Aims and research questions The study's aim was to examine and evaluate processes that enhance compassionate relationship-centred care within an older people care setting in an acute hospital. Key objectives were: to develop an understanding of the concept of compassionate relationship-centred care within the practice setting through exploring the views, perceptions and experiences of staff, patients and their families; to develop, implement and evaluate strategies that promote this concept; to examine the processes that need to be put in place to enable sustainability of these strategies; and to identify the lessons learnt to inform practice, education, policy and research. This study was part of a larger programme of work that aimed to integrate compassionate care across practice and education. Approach and methods My role as a senior nurse and practitioner researcher meant that I was in a unique position to be able to capture not just theoretical views of compassion but how this was enacted in practice. To do this the study used the approach of appreciative inquiry. A range of methods was used: participant observation, stories using emotional touchpoints, photo-elicitation, and group discussions to explore beliefs and values. Data were continually fedback to staff participants to involve them in analysis. An iterative and inductive process of immersion crystallization was used to analyse data. Findings A key finding was the development of a practice model to support practitioners to deliver compassionate relationship-centred care. This model suggests that, in order to deliver such care, people need to engage in the process of appreciative caring conversations in order to understand a) who people are and what matters to them; and b) how people feel about their experience. This in turn enables a process of working together to shape the way things are done. The findings support the notion that during these caring conversations the practitioner needs to connect emotionally, be curious, collaborative, able to compromise, considerate of <b>others</b> <b>perspectives,</b> courageous and actively celebrate when practices have worked well in order to promote compassionate relationship-centred care. This framework comprises the 7 ‘C's of caring conversations and makes a unique contribution to the body of knowledge in providing practical guidance as to the ‘how' of compassionate relationship-centred care. Key outcomes of implementing this model were that people felt comfortable to express emotions, developed stronger relationships, were more consistent in delivering compassionate care practice across the team, and had a sense of learned hopefulness in the face of complex and competing demands. Conclusions and implications Implementation of activities in practice to support this way of working revealed that these processes are complex, often requiring the practitioner to takes risks and therefore the provision of appropriate support, facilitation and strong leadership are important factors in helping to sustain such practices. The outcomes of this research build upon the existing knowledge base by providing a practice model that specifies how to deliver compassionate relationship-centred care, and they demonstrate the impact of using appreciative approaches to facilitate improvement within health care contexts.
