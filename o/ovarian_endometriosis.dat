40|$|Objetive: Thrombospondin- 1 serum {{levels is}} {{correlate}} with pelvic pain {{in patients with}} <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis.</b> Patients: Thrombospondin- 1 serum levels were prospectively analysed in 51 patients (group A asymptomatic patients or patients presenting mild dysmenorrhea and women comprised group B severe dysmenorrhea and/or chronic pelvic pain and/or dyspareunia) who underwent surgery for cystic <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> to asses whether a correlation exists among thrombospondin- 1 serum levels and pelvic pain. Results: From 56 patients, five cases were ultimateley excluded, because the histological diagnosis was other than cystic <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> (2 teratomas and 3 haemorragic cysts). The mean thrombospondin- 1 serum levels in group A was 256, 69 pg/ml_+ 37, 07 and in group B was 291, 41 pg/ml + 35, 59.

30|$|Objective: Patients with <b>ovarian</b> and pelvic <b>endometriosis</b> {{often have}} adhesions in pelvic cavity.

30|$|A {{total of}} 451 {{patients}} were treated using 3 D HD laparoscopic system.

40|$|Steroidogenic factor- 1 (SF- 1), a major protein {{regulating}} the complex cascade of steroidogenis, has been postulated {{to play a}} role in <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis.</b> However, the expression in situ of SF- 1 in <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> is unknown. To shed light on its presence, the expression of SF- 1 was studied by immunohistochemistry in 30 cases of <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> (proliferative, n= 15; secretory phase, n= 15) and in 10 cases of normal eutopic endometrium coming from the same patients. No SF- 1 immunoreactivity was observed in glands or endometrial stroma from <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> or eutopic endometrium. In contrast, a strong immunoreactivity was observed in the adjacent ovarian cortical or medullary mesenchymatous cells in all the cases examined independently of the cycle's phases. Contrary to the earlier reported hypothesis, our data showed for the first time the absence of SF- 1 expression in glands and endometrial stroma from <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> and eutopic endometrium. However, the strong expression of SF- 1 observed in cortical and medullary ovarian mesenchymatous cells adjacent to endometriosis, suggests a potential role for these cells in locally induced steroidogenesis.

40|$|We {{performed}} this retrospective {{case-control study}} analyzing 428 first-attempt {{in vitro fertilization}} (IVF) cycles, among which 254 involved women with a previous or present diagnosis of <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis.</b> First, {{the results of these}} 254 cycles were compared with 174 cycles involving patients with proven non-endometriotic tubal infertility having similar age and body mass index. Women with <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> had a significantly higher cancellation rate, but similar pregnancy, implantation and delivery rates as patients with tubal infertility. Second, among the women with <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis,</b> the women with a history of laparoscopic surgery for ovarian endometriomas prior to IVF and no visual endometriosis at ovum pick-up (n = 112) were compared with the nonoperated women and visual endometriomas at ovum pick-up (n = 142). Patients who underwent ovarian surgery before IVF had significantly shorter period, lower antral follicle count and required higher gonadotropin doses than patients with non-operated endometriomas. The two groups of women with a previous or present <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> did, however, have similar pregnancy, implantation and live birth rates. In conclusion, <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> does not reduce IVF outcome compared with tubal factor. Furthermore, laparoscopic removal of endometriomas does not improve IVF results, but may cause a decrease of ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropins...|$|E
40|$|Endometriosis may {{progress}} to invasive endometrioid adenocarcinoma, {{particularly in the}} ovary. Up to now, little is known of the molecular mechanisms possibly involved in the malignant transformation of endometriosis. Therefore, in this study, extragonadal endometriosis (n = 10), <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> without malignancy (n = 10), <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> with direct transition into endometrioid adenocarcinoma (n = 8), and normal endometrium (n = 12) were investigated for numerical chromosomal aberrations by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} using centromere enumeration probes. The proportions of cells with aneusomies were semiquantitatively assessed. Trisomies 1 and 7, and monosomies 9 and 17 were found in endometriosis, ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma, and normal endometrium. The proportions of aneusomic cells were significantly higher in ovarian endometrioid carcinoma compared with <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> (P < 0. 001), and in <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> compared with extragonadal endometriosis and normal endometrium (P < 0. 001). The data provide new evidence of a common lineage of endometriosis and ovarian endometrioid carcinoma. The higher frequency of chromosomal aberrations in endometrioid carcinoma than in endometriosis may reflect an expansion of aberrant cell clones already present in endometriosis during the progression to cancer. The higher frequency of chromosomal aberrations in <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> than in extragonadal endometriosis suggests a role of the ovarian stromal milieu in the induction of genetic changes, which may eventually lead to invasive cancer...|$|E

40|$|Acute-onset {{pelvic pain}} is an {{extremely}} common symptom in premenopausal women presenting to the emergency department. After excluding pregnancy in reproductive-age women, ultrasonography {{plays a major role}} in the prompt and accurate diagnosis of adnexal causes of acute pelvic pain, such as hemorrhagic <b>ovarian</b> cysts, <b>endometriosis,</b> <b>ovarian</b> torsion, and tubo-ovarian abscess. Its availability, relatively low cost, and lack of ionizing radiation make ultrasonography an ideal imaging modality in women of reproductive age.

40|$|Abstract In our {{previous}} low-density-array gene-expression analysis we found an increased expression of biglycan gene in <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> patients. In {{the present study}} we evaluated biglycan expression at the protein level in tissue, serum and peritoneal fluid (PF) from <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> patients, patients with benign ovarian cysts and healthy women. Twenty samples of endometriomas and 27 of control tissues (benign ovarian cysts and eutopic endometrium of healthy women) were obtained laparoscopically or by curettage. Serum and PF samples were collected from 56 <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> patients and 40 controls (patients with benign cysts and healthy women). Tissue biglycan levels and serum and PF biglycan concentrations were determined by Western blotting and ELISA, respectively. Biglycan was detected in endometriomas and in benign cysts tissues but differed in glycosylation levels. The PF biglycan concentrations were significantly increased in <b>ovarian</b> <b>endometriosis</b> patients (mean[*]±[*]SD[*]=[*] 220. 3 [*]±[*] 190. 5 [*]pg/mg protein) compared to the whole control group (101. 9 [*]±[*] 94. 7 [*]pg/mg protein, p[*]<[*] 0. 001), while serum concentrations did not differ significantly.
