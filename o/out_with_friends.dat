500|$|... "Party" [...] was {{described}} by Billboards Jeff Benjamin as an electropop song. He compared the guitar line to that on Katy Perry's 2010 song [...] "California Gurls", and the Auto-Tune to Daft Punk's 2014 single [...] "Get Lucky". Writing for Fuse, Benjamin noted that the track incorporated [...] "lively" [...] guitars, [...] "perky" [...] synthesizers, and a [...] "catchy" [...] hook. A reviewer from The Malay Mail characterized the song as [...] "upbeat" [...] bubblegum pop with a theme {{similar to that of}} [...] "California Gurls" [...] and Kesha's 2010 song [...] "Tik Tok". Lyrically, [...] "Party" [...] is about a girls' night <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>friends,</b> and mentions drinking lemon soju, mojito and tequila.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} song for its simple yet {{effective}} lyrics and sharp guitar sound.

McIlrath has noted how fans have used the song for various purposes, including school graduations, proms, weddings, and funerals.

500|$|Bopp did not own a telescope. He was <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>friends</b> near Stanfield, Arizona observing star {{clusters}} and galaxies when he chanced across the comet {{while at the}} eyepiece of his friend's telescope. He realized he might have spotted something new when, like Hale, he checked his star maps to determine if any other deep-sky objects {{were known to be}} near M70, and found that there were none. He alerted the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams through a Western Union telegram. Brian G. Marsden, who had run the bureau since 1968, laughed, [...] "Nobody sends telegrams anymore. I mean, by the time that telegram got here, Alan Hale had already e-mailed us three times with updated coordinates." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Kitty Kat" [...] was {{conceived}} partly at the Sony Music Studios, in New York City and the Record Plant Studios, in Los Angeles. It sees songwriting duties by Knowles, Pharrell Williams, Makeba Riddick {{as well as}} Shawn Carter, and utilizes production from The Neptunes, compromising of Williams and Chad Hugo. The latter also produced the song [...] "Green Light" [...] (2006). Jason Goldstein mixed [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] with assistance from Steve Tolle. Concerning the song, Knowles told MTV: [...] " [...] is [...] very sexy , talking {{about a man who}} is <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>friends</b> all night and you're left at home. And you are like, 'No more of this. It's time to go.'" [...] The song appeared online through the website of Rap-Up magazine on August 23, 2006, prior to the release of B'Day.|$|E

500|$|... "Friday" [...] {{uses the}} 50s {{progression}}, an I-VI-IV-V chord progression that many popular songs have used such as [...] "Heart and Soul" [...] and [...] "Unchained Melody". It is {{performed in the}} key of B major at a tempo of 112 beats per minute. According to Randy Lewis of Los Angeles Times, the familiar structure contributes to the song's catchiness, making it what others have called an earworm. The song also sees Black on a harmony track. In a review for Rolling Stone, writer Matthew Perpetua described the vocals as having [...] "a peculiar tonality that inadvertently highlights the absurdity of boilerplate pop lyrics," [...] adding that the tone in the refrain [...] "sounds unlike anything else in pop music." [...] He noted the sound as being not entirely agreeable to listen to, but stated that Black ultimately ends up [...] "sounding like a distinct singer with an alluring sort of anti-charisma." [...] The lyrics of the song speak about [...] "hanging <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>friends</b> and having fun." [...] Paul Asay of Plugged In noted that lyrics reflect the happenings of a day, {{in the life of}} a teenager like Black, like eating breakfast and going to school. [...] "She's excited 'cause it's Friday. Which means a weekend full of possibility awaits," [...] he concluded.|$|E

The next day, she collapsed {{in the middle of}} a ball from violent labour pains brought on by the previous day's activities; Dmitri was born in the hours following the accident. Alexandra slipped into a coma from which she never emerged. Although doctors had no hope for Dmitri's survival, he still lived, with the help of Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, who gave the premature Dmitri the baths that were prescribed by the doctors, wrapped him in cotton wool and kept him in a cradle filled with hot water bottles to keep his temperature regulated. [...] "I am enjoying raising Dmitri," [...] Sergei wrote in his diary. Alexandra died shortly after Dmitri's birth. She was only 21, and the cause was almost certainly preeclampsia.|$|E
