5|$|San Diego and its backcountry {{suffer from}} {{periodic}} wildfires. In October 2003, San Diego {{was the site}} of the Cedar Fire, called the largest wildfire in California <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>century.</b> The fire burned , killed 15 people, and destroyed more than 2,200 homes. In addition to damage caused by the fire, smoke resulted in a significant increase in emergency room visits due to asthma, respiratory problems, eye irritation, and smoke inhalation; the poor air quality caused San Diego County schools to close for a week. Wildfires four years later destroyed some areas, particularly within the communities of Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Santa Fe, and Ramona.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the modern}} period the {{situation}} of indigenous languages has grown increasingly precarious in Mexico, and the numbers of speakers of virtually all indigenous languages have dwindled. Although the absolute number of Nahuatl speakers has actually risen <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>century,</b> indigenous populations have become increasingly marginalized in Mexican society. In 1895, Nahuatl was spoken by over 5% of the population. By 2000, this proportion had fallen to 1.49%. Given the process of marginalization combined with the trend of migration to urban areas and to the United States, some linguists are warning of impending language death. At present Nahuatl is mostly spoken in rural areas by an impoverished class of indigenous subsistence agriculturists. According to the Mexican national statistics institute, INEGI, 51% of Nahuatl speakers {{are involved in the}} farming sector and 6 in 10 receive no wages or less than the minimum wage.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{temperatures}} tend {{to increase}} evaporation {{which can lead}} to more precipitation. Precipitation generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 through 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>century,</b> although trends have varied widely by region and over time. Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter. The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier. There has been {{an increase in the number}} of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics. Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation and/or more evaporation). Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1percent since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6 percent per century) and the South (11.1percent). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (−9.25percent).|$|E
5|$|Madagascar's varied fauna and flora are {{endangered}} by human activity. Since {{the arrival of}} humans around 2,350years ago, Madagascar has lost more than 90percent of its original forest. This forest loss is largely fueled by tavy ("fat"), a traditional slash-and-burn agricultural practice imported to Madagascar by the earliest settlers. Malagasy farmers embrace and perpetuate the practice {{not only for its}} practical benefits as an agricultural technique, but for its cultural associations with prosperity, health and venerated ancestral custom (fomba malagasy). As human population density rose on the island, deforestation accelerated beginning around 1400 years ago. By the 16th century, the central highlands had been largely cleared of their original forests. More recent contributors to the loss of forest cover include the growth in cattle herd size since their introduction around 1000 years ago, a continued reliance on charcoal as a fuel for cooking, and the increased prominence of coffee as a cash crop <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>century.</b> According to a conservative estimate, about 40percent of the island's original forest cover was lost from the 1950s to 2000, with a thinning of remaining forest areas by 80percent. In addition to traditional agricultural practice, wildlife conservation is challenged by the illicit harvesting of protected forests, as well as the state-sanctioned harvesting of precious woods within national parks. Although banned by then-President Marc Ravalomanana from 2000 to 2009, the collection of small quantities of precious timber from national parks was re-authorized in January 2009 and dramatically intensified under the administration of Andry Rajoelina as a key source of state revenues to offset cuts in donor support following Ravalomanana's ousting.|$|E
