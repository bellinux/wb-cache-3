5|$|The Alabama {{legislature}} {{passed the}} Cater Act in 1949, allowing {{cities and counties}} to set up industrial development boards (IDB) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. George E. McNally, Mobile's first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was {{the driving force behind}} the founding of the IDB. The Mobile Area Chamber <b>of</b> <b>Commerce,</b> believing its members were better qualified to attract new businesses and industry to the area, considered the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, the Chamber <b>of</b> <b>Commerce</b> emerged victorious. While McNally's IDB prompted the Chamber <b>of</b> <b>Commerce</b> to become more proactive in attracting new industry, the chamber effectively shut Mobile city government out of economic development decisions.|$|E
