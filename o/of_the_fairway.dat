25|$|As a way {{of opening}} his first course design in the UK (Chart Hills in Kent), Faldo teed up on the dog-leg right par five. He drove into the middle-right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fairway,</b> he then teed another ball and drove off, the two balls {{finished}} within 6inches {{of each other and}} to this day can be seen set into the fairway in a protective case. This was a mark of the man's golfing ability at his peak. Faldo also worked on several overseas golf courses like The Fortress at Louisbourg Resort Golf & Spa on Cape Breton Island, Canada. Most recently, he designed a world-class course in San Miguel de Allende, México. Ventanas de San Miguel hosts an 18-hole par-70 course that was opened in late 2010.|$|E
500|$|Strong's {{architectural}} work {{was to be}} commended as praise worthy for its originality. He excelled in making his golf courses stand out with interesting features such as multi-tiered greens and deep, cavernous bunkers. Strong managed to advance his art form {{to a higher level}} not always approached by other architects. Asked to articulate his philosophy of golf course design, Strong said, [...] "the duty of the golf architect is to build natural beauty into every possible feature of play." [...] He believed in the need for good shot-making and felt that a player should pay a high price for a poorly executed shot—occasionally with very dire results. [...] His greens were what set him apart and often set more of the strategy than the equally daunting bunkers. [...] He designed boldly contoured greens that required careful approach, from the ideal side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fairway,</b> to avoid running through the green and into trouble beyond. [...] Strong is credited with designing the first island green in the United States. [...] Strong designed this oft-copied challenge—the dreaded 9th hole—in 1928 on the Ocean Course at Ponte Vedra Inn and Club. [...] The course was scheduled to host the 1939 Ryder Cup matches if World War II had not intervened. [...] The island itself, lying 157 yards from the tee, is edged by palm trees and peppered with bunkers; the hole seldom plays easy due to stiff ocean breezes. The Ocean Course was redesigned by Robert Trent Jones Sr. in 1947, then again by Bobby Weed in 1998. The 1947 redesign by Jones was an attempt to reduce some of the severity of Strong's design features.|$|E
2500|$|Needing a par on the 18th {{hole for}} a {{one-shot}} victory, Mickelson continued with his aggressive {{style of play}} and chose to hit a driver off the tee; he hit his shot well left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fairway</b> (he had only hit two of thirteen fairways previously in the round).

2500|$|When {{the initial}} shot on a hole is {{intended}} to move the ball a long distance (typically more than [...] ), the shot is commonly called a [...] "drive" [...] and is generally made with a long-shafted, large-headed wood club called a [...] "driver".

The goal of getting the ball into the hole ("holing" [...] the ball) in as few strokes as possible may be impeded by obstacles such as areas of longer grass called [...] "rough" [...] (usually found alongside fairways), which both slows any ball that contacts it and makes it harder to advance a ball that has stopped on it; [...] "doglegs", which are changes in the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fairway</b> that often require shorter shots to play around them; bunkers (or sand traps); and water hazards such as ponds or streams.|$|E
2500|$|Brighton's first {{large-scale}} {{industry was}} the railway works, established {{next to the}} railway station in 1842. [...] Several extensions were built as demand grew for locomotive manufacture and repair: in 1889, the buildings had to be extended on iron piers across {{the floor of the}} steeply sloping valley. After closure in 1957, some of the buildings were converted into a bubble car factory, which made 30,000 three-wheeled Isettas in the next seven years. The whole site was cleared between 1962 and 1969, and the mixed-use New England Quarter now covers the area. (The LBSCR also established a railway mission chapel for employees of the locomotive works; the flint-built Gothic Revival-style building on Viaduct Road is still in religious use, having been taken over by an Evangelical group.) The British Engineerium in West Blatchington is a museum which occupies a mid-Victorian former water pumping station. [...] Its bold polychromatic brickwork, symmetrical High Victorian Gothic engine room building, visually dominant chimney and associated structures—all of which are listed—combine to form [...] "an unusually fine asset" [...] which is [...] "a splendid example of Victorian industrial engineering". A former brewery in the ancient village centre of Portslade dominates the surrounding flint buildings. [...] The [...] "characterful" [...] Classical/Italianate five-storey yellow-brick building was built in 1881 and is now in mixed industrial and commercial use. The former Phoenix Brewery (1821) between Grand Parade and the Hanover district was historically significant but architecturally modest, apart from the later brewery office and adjacent Free Butt pub. [...] Closure came in the early 1990s, and the site was redeveloped for student housing. Allen West & Co. Ltd, an electrical engineering company which was a major employer in northeast Brighton from 1910, built several distinctive factories on Lewes Road and the Moulsecoomb estate, especially in the 1940s and 1950s.

40|$|White grubs are {{the most}} {{prevalent}} insect pests of both high and low maintenance turfgrass in New York State. Grub control in turf with insecticides is complicated because the lower toxicity insecticides need to be applied before the need for their application can be assessed and the two labeled curative insecticides are highly toxic and have variable efficacy against white grubs. Demand is increasing among homeowners, grounds managers and golf course superintendents for low-impact grub control practices and products, such as biological control. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are the only effective biological control for grubs. This project builds on work begun in 2013, funded by a Community IPM grant. It tests <b>the</b> feasibility <b>of</b> classical biological control by reintroducing native NY strains of entomopathogenic nematodes into the turf system to augment existing nematode populations to suppress grub populations over multiple years. A second evaluation assay sampling for grubs and treatment impact prior to insect pupation in <b>the</b> treated <b>fairways</b> was done in spring 2014. Results showed continued persistence for EPNs introduced as an augmentation to current populations in the turf although S. carpocapsae presence had declined since the fall 2013 assay while H. bacteriophora had not increased. Comparison of white grub totals from both the fall 2013 and spring 2014 were inconclusive. In other systems, impact of native nematodes tends to phase in over 2 - 3 years before their full impact is observed. <b>The</b> poor persistence <b>of</b> S. carpocapsae and H. bacteriophora raised questions about <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persistence genes from the laboratory cultures. Since the cultures were reinitiated from new isolations {{in the late summer}} and fall of 2013, a decision was made to reinoculate those nematodes on <b>the</b> appropriate <b>fairways.</b> <b>The</b> lack <b>of</b> efficacy from H. bacteriophora, a species sold commercially for grub control also influenced the decision to increase <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> application to <b>the</b> commercial levels (1 billion per acre) and follow the application with irrigation. A third evaluation sampling for grubs in the fall 2014 indicated a reduction in grub numbers in some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treated sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fairways.</b> In early summer 2014, biocontrol nematodes were applied to 9 greens and 9 greens were left untreated as a treatment plan for cutworms.

We applied a reproductive control program to a population of eastern grey kangaroos confined to a golf course in South East Queensland. The program aimed to reduce fecundity sufficiently for the population to decrease over time so that overgrazing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fairways</b> and <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> human–animal conflict situations were minimised. In 2003, 92 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female kangaroos above 5 kg bodyweight were implanted with the GnRH agonist deslorelin after darting with a dissociative anaesthetic.
