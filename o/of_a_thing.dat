5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E

500|$|In early {{philosophies of}} {{psychology}} and metaphysics, conatus ( [...] ; Latin for [...] "effort; endeavor; impulse, inclination, tendency; undertaking; striving") is an innate inclination <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> to continue to exist and enhance itself. This [...] "thing" [...] may be mind, matter {{or a combination of}} both. Over the millennia, many different definitions and treatments have been formulated. Seventeenth-century philosophers René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Leibniz, and Thomas Hobbes made important contributions. [...] The conatus may refer to the instinctive [...] "will to live" [...] of living organisms or to various metaphysical theories of motion and inertia. Often the concept is associated with God's will in a pantheist view of Nature. The concept may be broken up into separate definitions for the mind and body and split when discussing centrifugal force and inertia.|$|E
500|$|A Rutgers University study, {{published}} in 2011, {{was the first}} to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain, and supports the possibility of a distinct G-spot. When the research team asked several women to stimulate themselves in a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) machine, brain scans showed stimulating the clitoris, vagina and cervix lit up distinct areas of the women's sensory cortex, which means the brain registered distinct feelings between stimulating the clitoris, the cervix and the vaginal wall – where the G-spot is reported to be. [...] "I think that the bulk of the evidence shows that the G-spot is not a particular thing," [...] stated Barry Komisaruk, head of the research findings. [...] "It's not like saying, 'What is the thyroid gland?' The G-spot is more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> like New York City is a thing.

40|$|Title: Administration <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{immovable}} <b>thing</b> in {{enforcement procedure}} {{conducted by a}} court enforcement officer and by a licensed enforcement agent The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the administration <b>of</b> <b>an</b> immovable <b>thing</b> in enforcement procedure conducted by a court enforcement officer and by a licensed enforcement agent. The administration <b>of</b> <b>an</b> immovable <b>thing</b> is <b>a</b> new way <b>of</b> enforcement procedure, implemented to Czech legislation by amendment of the Civil Procedure Code that came into effect on 1 st January. 2013. This thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first one contains just the brief overview of the main problems. Second chapter describes the enforcement procedure conducted by a court enforcement officer and by a licensed enforcement agent in general. Third chapter explains detailed characteristics <b>of</b> <b>an</b> administration <b>of</b> <b>an</b> immovable <b>thing</b> in enforcement procedure conducted by a court enforcement officer and by a licensed enforcement agent, its process, duration and conclusion. Fourth chapter deals with identification of main problems <b>of</b> <b>an</b> administration <b>of</b> <b>an</b> immovable <b>thing</b> and deals with them. Especially deals with problems regarding possible limitations of court in modification of leasing and tenure contracts. The possible use <b>of</b> <b>an</b> immovable <b>thing</b> by <b>a</b> debtor and possible [...] ...|$|R
500|$|There {{were several}} {{possible}} actions {{available to the}} claimant. In the typical theft, the damages were a multiple {{of the value of}} the thing stolen, available through the actio furti. A subsequent rise in the value of the thing stolen whilst the claim was being brought was borne by the defendant, if found liable. If part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> was stolen, probably the value of that part. A successful action for theft brought with it infamia for the thief. [...] If the claimant had an interest short of ownership, then the value of that interest formed the basis for the damages instead. An heir of the claimant could sue, but the heir of a thief was not liable. Some types of theft were criminal wrongs by the end of the republic. Ulpian reports that criminal proceedings were more common, and Julian that a successful prosecution prevented a civil action under furtum. Even furtum itself was not compensatory but penal in nature.|$|E

Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly compared the song to Cruz' prior single [...] "Break Your Heart", noting that Cruz had [...] "struck gold" [...] {{with the song}} and that [...] "Dirty Picture" [...] was the only song on the album with [...] "equal caliber." [...] In {{a review of the}} album, Mike Diver of BBC wrote that the song was [...] "the kind of track Sugababes should be patching up their every difference ever for." [...] In a separate publication from BBC, Fraser McAlpine wrote that although the song's lyrics were dumb, silly and crude, [...] "none of [...] are bad things in themselves." [...] McAlpine complimented the overall sound of Kesha and Cruz's vocal work together on the song commenting that [...] "the jarring clash between Taio's supersmooth soul-gentleman image and Kesha's sloppy drunken nonsense is genuinely fascinating. The song actually transforms from one kind <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> to another, depending who has their hand on the microphone." ...|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{never saw}} himself as a science-fiction writer, and was often {{critical}} of the genre. He particularly disliked the BBC series Doctor Who (1963–89; 1996; 2005–present), {{for which he had}} once turned down an offer to write. [...] "It sounded a terrible idea and I still think it was," [...] he commented in 1986. [...] "The fact that it's lasted a long time and has a steady audience doesn't mean much. So has Crossroads and that's a stinker". He also slammed Blake's 7, which he described as the lowest point of British television science-fiction: [...] "I think the low point for me would be the very few bits I've seen <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> called Blake's 7 which I found paralytically awful. The dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling" [...] and Doomwatch: [...] "I was approached to write Doomwatch. That didn't seem to be much good either." [...] Doctor Who was heavily influenced by Kneale's Quatermass serials, in some cases even using specific storylines that were very similar to those from Quatermass.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} {{statutory}} provisions prohibit incitement. Under section 107(a) of the Penal Code, {{a person is}} said to [...] the doing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> {{if he or she}} instigates someone to do that thing. If a person abets an offence, and as a result the act abetted is committed, the person is to be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. If the offence is not committed due to the abetment, and it is punishable by imprisonment, the abettor is to be imprisoned for up to a quarter of the maximum jail term of the offence, or may receive a fine, or both. If either the abettor or the person abetted is a public servant whose duty it was to prevent the offence from happening, the abettor may be imprisoned for up to half of the maximum jail term of the offence, or may be fined, or receive both penalties. However, if the offence abetted but not committed is punishable with death or life imprisonment, the abettor is liable to a penalty of up to seven years' imprisonment, a fine, or both. If any hurt is caused {{as a result of the}} abetment, the abettor may be jailed up to 14 years and must also be fined.|$|E
500|$|Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music {{stated that}} he thought the song was {{not as good as}} [...] "Toxic" [...] by Britney Spears but was {{incredibly}} similar. After dubbing it a weaker version of [...] "Toxic", he said, [...] "And that just leaves us here with a song [...] which is all stomp and huff, a dramatic bang <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing,</b> which seeks to drag all the bad girls to the dancefloor so they can holler their evil intentions to into the faces of nervous men. It's a song which makes the most of Nicole's unwholesome sexiness– as opposed to wholesome, you understand, I'm not saying there's anything gross about her– and has drama and fury on its side." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy agreed saying that [...] "Scherzinger has managed to bag herself a banger of an (ahem) debut single". He described the song's busy production as [...] "having a whiff of the Berline [...] "teknoklub" [...] that is a [...] "racket in the best possible way". Levine also praised Scherzinger for her conviction on the song, awarding it five out of five stars. He gave [...] "Poison" [...] a better reception than he awarded Scherzinger's previous attempt, [...] "Baby Love" [...] (2007), which he only awarded three out of five stars, stating that it was the wrong single to launch the career of a world-class superstar.|$|E
500|$|Contrectatio meant [...] "handling" [...] and was {{established}} as the prohibited action associated with furtum {{before the end}} of the republic. Furtum had in the early and mid-Republic required the carrying away <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing.</b> This was widened and there are several examples from the classical Rome and later where it is even hard to find physical contact in any sense. Contrectatio extended to dealing with the thing as if the owner, and [...] "physical interference" [...] can be considered a more accurate term than just touching. The idea of furtum, and conrectatio in particular, broadened during the republic to complement the narrowly defined Lex Aquilia. This did, for example, include using a borrowed thing in a way which went beyond that agreed with the lender (furtum usus), such as borrowing a horse and riding it for longer than agreed. During the Republic, no distinction was made in language between furtum usus and furtum in general. Contrectio included what might be thought of as fraud: knowingly accepting a wrongful payment, or embezzlement, for example. The case of wrongful payment is problematic, because a mistaken payment still transferred ownership; it seems contradictory that the receiver was granted ownership and still liable for theft. To accept a thing as a pledge knowing that it did not belong to the pledgor was also furtum [...] not merely acting as an accomplice. Plautus, a playwright, suggests that failing to report a theft after the fact was furtum, but this should not be assumed. The development of contrectio as the preferred prohibited act accompanied that of the criminal law, the actio doli (for fraud) and the Aquilian actions.|$|E

2500|$|Classical economists {{presented}} competing {{theories of}} those of Smith, termed the [...] "labour theory of value". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of Karl Marx's major work, Capital, was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he {{considered to be the}} exploitation of labour by capital. The labour theory of value held that the value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> was determined by the labour that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern contention of neoclassical economics, that the value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.|$|E
