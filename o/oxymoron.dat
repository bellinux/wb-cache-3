She {{had been a member}} of the British Communist Party, but left after the 1956 Hungarian uprising. Some reviewers labelled the novel a satire, while Lessing called it humorous. The title is an <b>oxymoron</b> which highlights Alice's ambivalent nature.|$|E

The album was {{released}} on February 25, 2014, by Top Dawg Entertainment and Interscope Records. <b>Oxymoron</b> was his first album released under a major record label to music retailers, whereas his previous albums were released independently to digital retailers only.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article {{examines}} the promotion of corporate <b>oxymorons</b> that con-ceal the harm caused by corporations to people and environments. They {{are part of a}} larger set of strategies used by corporations to manage or neutralize critique. They often pair a desirable cover term such as safe or sustainable with a description of their product, for example cigarettes or mining. Repetition of the resulting con-tradictions—safe cigarettes or sustainable mining—renders the terms familiar and seemingly plausible. We suggest that the analysis of corporate <b>oxymorons</b> provides a valuable entry into the anthropology of capitalism...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of objectivity {{has always been}} of major interest to researchers, since Akhmatova’s poetry is considered as a variation of objective poetry. In {{the first part of}} my article I examine this phenomenon {{on the basis of the}} short analysis of the poem Cherneet doroga primorskogo sada…, in relation to symbols, motifs, <b>oxymorons</b> and the time-structure of the poem. According to the theory of V. Vinogradov, the time structure of Akhmatova’s poems consists of only one moment. The purpose of this work is to prove this in connection with the semantic and syntactic structures of the poem Vecherom, and to examine the role of semantic <b>oxymorons</b> as the most relevant text-organising elements. The other most important feature of the semantic and rhyme structure of this poem is the tendency to form a closed circle. This tendency and the presence of <b>oxymorons</b> are characteristics of Akhmatova’s code at text level. On the other hand, this code is influenced by the poet’s artistic outlook on life.

500|$|The cover art {{and title}} of the album was first affirmed via the RCA Records website. Regarding the {{title of the}} album, Yankovic {{mentioned}} that, [...] "That was just an <b>oxymoron</b> that I've always been amused by.

500|$|The authors' {{claim that}} nuclear power and clean coal are not clean technologies. [...] Apart from the risks {{associated}} with nuclear power, [...] "multibillion-dollar nuclear plants are simply not cost-effective when compared with other energy sources." [...] The authors also believe that clean coal is an <b>oxymoron</b> for a myriad of reasons, including the sheer number of coal mine-related deaths and the fact that coal-fired plants, even some cleaner ones, are major contributors to serious illnesses such as asthma, heart disease, and mercury poisoning.|$|E
500|$|Francesca Rheannon in Sustainability Investment News {{says that}} the book does not ask the most {{challenging}} question of all: is [...] "clean growth" [...] an <b>oxymoron?</b> She says that {{at a time when}} some experts say carbon emissions will need to be cut by 80 to 90% by 2050, the world may have to accept steady or even decreasing energy production, no matter how clean it is. Rheannon also states that there is little coverage of social issues.

500|$|In 1998 Hügel-Marshall {{published}} her autobiography, Daheim unterwegs: Ein deutsches Leben, chronicling {{her experiences}} surviving {{as a black}} woman in Germany. Daheim means [...] "at home" [...] while unterwegs means [...] "on the way" [...] or [...] "in transit"; the combination is a deliberate <b>oxymoron</b> suggesting someone seeking a home in her own country. The English translation of the book, published in 2001 by Continuum International Publishers, is titled Invisible Woman: Growing Up Black in Germany; an annotated English version was published by Peter Lang Publishing in 2008. The book explores the relationship with her father and with Germany, and describes a search for her identity.|$|E

50|$|Hughes' {{early works}} were often playful, putting things back to front or {{squashing}} them flat, like Clown (1963) and Liquorice Allsorts (1960), setting words against images, like One Two (1962), or against themselves, like Tick Cross (1962). He explored visual <b>oxymorons</b> and paradoxes. His {{fascination with the}} illusion of perspective began with works like Infinity (1963), Three Doors (1964) and The Space Ruler (1965).|$|R
500|$|After leaving Connecticut on a Sunday {{morning in}} 2007 for Monday Night Football in Pittsburgh, Scott had a {{stomachache}}. After the stomachache worsened, {{he went to}} the hospital instead of the game and later had his appendix removed. After testing the appendix, doctors learned that he had cancer. Two days later, he had surgery in New York that removed part of his colon and some of his lymph nodes near the appendix. After the surgery, they recommended preventive chemotherapy. By December, Scott—while undergoing chemotherapy—hosted Friday night ESPN NBA coverage and led the coverage of ABC's NBA Christmas Day studio show. Scott worked out while undergoing chemotherapy. Scott said of his experience with cancer at the time: [...] "One of the coolest things about having cancer, and I know that sounds like an <b>oxymoron,</b> is meeting other people who've had to fight it. You have a bond. It's like a fraternity or sorority." [...] When Scott returned to work and people knew of his cancer diagnosis, the well-wishers felt overbearing for him as he just wanted to talk about sports, not cancer.|$|E
500|$|Several {{critics have}} called The Good Terrorists title an <b>oxymoron.</b> Robert Boschman {{suggested}} it {{is indicative of}} Alice's [...] "contradictory personality" [...] – she renovates the squat's house, yet is bent on destroying society. In The Hudson Review, George Kearns wrote that the title [...] "hovers above the novel with... irony". The reader assumes that Alice is the [...] "good terrorist", but that while {{she may be a}} good person, she is [...] "rotten at being a terrorist". Writing in World Literature Today, Mona Knapp concluded that Lessing's heroine, the [...] "good terrorist", is neither a good person, nor a good revolutionary. She knows how to renovate houses and manipulate people to her advantage, but she is unemployed and steals money from her parents. When real revolutionaries start using the squat to ship arms, she panics and, going behind her comrades' backs, makes a telephone call to the authorities to warn them. Knapp called Alice [...] "a bad terrorist and a stunted human being". Fishburn suggested that it is Lessing herself who is the [...] "good terrorist", symbolised here by Alice, but that hers is [...] "political terrorism of a literary kind", where she frequently disguises her ideas in [...] "very domestic-looking fiction", and [...] "direct challenge... our sense of reality".|$|E
500|$|I. Q. Hunter {{identifies}} a prefabricated cult film style {{which includes}} [...] "deliberately, insulting bad films", [...] "slick exercises in dysfunction and alienation", and mainstream films [...] "that sell themselves as worth obsessing over". [...] Writing for NPR, Scott Tobias states that Don Coscarelli, whose previous films effortlessly attracted cult followings, has drifted into this realm. [...] Tobias criticizes Coscarelli as {{trying too hard}} to appeal to cult audiences and sacrificing internal consistency for calculated quirkiness. [...] Influenced by the successful online hype of The Blair Witch Project (1999), other films have attempted to draw online cult fandom {{with the use of}} prefabricated cult appeal. [...] Snakes on a Plane (2006) is an example that attracted massive attention from curious fans. [...] Uniquely, its cult following preceded the film's release and included speculative parodies of what fans imagined the film might be. [...] This reached the point of convergence culture when fan speculation began to impact on the film's production. [...] Although it was proclaimed a cult film and major game-changer before it was released, it failed to win either mainstream audiences or maintain its cult following. [...] In retrospect, critic Spencer Kornhaber would call it a serendipitous novelty and a footnote to a [...] "more naive era of the Internet". [...] However, it became influential in both marketing and titling. [...] This trend of [...] "instant cult classics" [...] which are hailed yet fail to attain a lasting following is described by Matt Singer, who states that the phrase is an <b>oxymoron.</b>|$|E
