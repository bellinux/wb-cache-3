Number of vomerine teeth equaling 33, forming a distinguished transverse arc. Number of costal grooves equals 13.|$|E
5|$|Asexuality is {{the lack}} of sexual {{attraction}} to others, or low <b>or</b> <b>absent</b> interest in or desire for sexual activity. It may be considered the lack of a sexual orientation, or one of the variations thereof, alongside heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality.|$|E
5|$|On {{compatible}} systems, the Microsoft Windows version uses Nvidia's PhysX software {{engine to}} produce more realistic, dynamic interactions with the game world. With PhysX enabled, some areas contain additional snow or fog (which reacts to Batman moving through it); with PhysX disabled, the effects are lessened <b>or</b> <b>absent.</b>|$|E

5|$|Paralytic {{poliomyelitis}} may be clinically suspected {{in individuals}} experiencing acute onset of flaccid paralysis {{in one or}} more limbs with decreased <b>or</b> <b>absent</b> tendon reflexes in the affected limbs that cannot be attributed to another apparent cause, and without sensory or cognitive loss.|$|E
5|$|Prior to opening, {{the flower}} buds are enveloped and {{protected}} {{in a thin}} dry papery or membranous (scarious) spathe. The spathe consists of a singular bract that is ribbed, and which remains wrapped {{around the base of}} the open flower. As the bud grows, the spathe splits longitudinally. Bracteoles are small <b>or</b> <b>absent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Snakes and limbless lizards {{typically}} possess {{only the}} right lung {{as a major}} respiratory organ; the left lung is greatly reduced, or even absent. Amphisbaenians, however, have the opposite arrangement, with a major left lung, and a reduced <b>or</b> <b>absent</b> right lung.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species has}} 66 chromosomes, closely {{resembling}} the karyotype of the dwarf lemurs (genus Cheirogaleus).

50|$|The {{extraordinary}} minister's {{function is}} to distribute Holy Communion, either within Mass or by taking it to a sick person, when an ordained minister (bishop, priest <b>or</b> deacon) is <b>absent</b> <b>or</b> impeded.|$|R
5|$|Some {{characteristics}} of the mushroom-forming genera (marked with * below) can be less obvious <b>or</b> <b>absent</b> in tropical species. Distinguishing between Lactarius and Lactifluus based on morphology alone is quite difficult, as clear synapomorphies for both genera {{have yet to be}} identified. Most field guides treat the two genera together, often because Lactifluus is not yet recognised as a separate genus.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestor}} of Noronhomys {{may have been}} a semiaquatic animal, similar to living Holochilus or Lundomys, that arrived on Fernando de Noronha by chance on a floating log. The morphology of the limb bones in Noronhomys suggests that the animal was not semiaquatic like its relatives, but terrestrial, consistent with its occurrence on a small island, where streams and pools are rare <b>or</b> <b>absent.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{islands are}} {{completely}} crossed by three narrow channels which resemble and are called rivers, {{though they are}} inlets of the sea. The wildlife is much like that of New Guinea, 150 miles (240 km) away, which he supposes was once connected by a land bridge. Most flowers are green; large and showy flowers are rare <b>or</b> <b>absent.</b>|$|E
50|$|When these {{channels}} are not functioning correctly, <b>or</b> are <b>absent</b> from their usual domains, several issues can result.|$|R
50|$|It is {{restricted}} to v√°rzea and other wooded habitats near water. It is rare <b>or</b> entirely <b>absent</b> away from large rivers.|$|R
50|$|Species in {{this group}} are short cycled. The {{zoospore}} nucleus forms a sorus. Resting spores are either unknown <b>or</b> truly <b>absent.</b>|$|R
5|$|There {{is little}} {{variation}} in colour over its range, though occasional females are darker overall than average, with markings less prominent <b>or</b> <b>absent.</b> The double drummer is larger and darker overall than the northern double drummer (T.sessiliba); {{the latter has}} a white band on the abdomen, while the former has black markings {{on the leading edge}} (costa) of the forewing extending past the basal cell.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the eye socket of Euchambersia is rather small. The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back {{and bottom of the}} eye socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced <b>or</b> <b>absent</b> entirely. Meanwhile, the top of the eye socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further {{to the side of the}} jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E
5|$|Causes of {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} include an ear canal blocked by ear wax, ossicles that are fixed together <b>or</b> <b>absent,</b> or holes in the eardrum. Conductive hearing loss may also result from middle ear inflammation causing fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space, such as by otitis media. Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ear's eardrum and ossicles. Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum. Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.|$|E
50|$|Species in {{this section}} have sessile leaves that are often minute, bract-like, and rarely form rosettes. Scapes are very short <b>or</b> mostly <b>absent.</b>|$|R

50|$|Leydig cell {{hypoplasia}} {{does not}} occur in biological females as {{they do not have}} either Leydig cells or testicles. However, the cause of the condition in males, luteinizing hormone insensitivity, does affect females, and because LH plays a role in the female reproductive system, it can result in primary amenorrhea <b>or</b> oligomenorrhea (<b>absent</b> <b>or</b> reduced menstruation), infertility due to anovulation, and ovarian cysts.|$|R
5|$|Compared {{with the}} Bactrian camel, the {{dromedary}} has a lighter build, longer limbs, shorter hairs, a harder palate and an insignificant <b>or</b> <b>absent</b> ethmoidal fissure. Unlike the camelids {{of the genus}} Lama, the dromedary has a hump, and in comparison has a longer tail, smaller ears, squarer feet and a greater height at the shoulder. The dromedary has four teats instead of the two in the Lama species.|$|E
5|$|Deficiency of {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), {{together}} {{referred to as}} the gonadotropins, leads to different symptoms in men and women. Women experience oligo- or amenorrhea (infrequent/light <b>or</b> <b>absent</b> menstrual periods respectively) and infertility. Men lose facial, scrotal and trunk hair, as well as suffering decreased muscle mass and anemia. Both sexes may experience a decrease in libido and loss of sexual function, and have an increased risk of osteoporosis (bone fragility). Lack of LH/FSH in children is associated with delayed puberty.|$|E
5|$|Historically in Lancashire, Crompton (as it was {{originally}} known) and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient British and Anglian activity in the area. During the Middle Ages, Crompton formed a small township of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland, and swamp with a small and close community of families. The local lordship was weak <b>or</b> <b>absent,</b> and so Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. Farming was the main industry of this broadly independent and self-supporting rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system.|$|E
50|$|When {{this vein}} is small, <b>or</b> {{altogether}} <b>absent,</b> the left superior intercostal vein may extend {{as low as}} the fifth or sixth intercostal space.|$|R
50|$|Although it {{is a rare}} {{subset of}} polycystic ovary syndrome, studies on {{patients}} with HAIR-AN {{played a key role}} in elucidating the pathogenesis of the former. In particular, although HAIR-AN results from two very different types of abnormalities - blocking antibodies against the insulin receptor <b>OR</b> genetically <b>absent</b> <b>or</b> reduced insulin receptor number/function - patients with both types have high levels of androgens (male hormones).|$|R
