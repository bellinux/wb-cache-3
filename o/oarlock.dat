25|$|By the 5th century BC, {{the first}} triremes were in use by various {{powers in the}} eastern Mediterranean. It had now become a fully developed, highly {{specialized}} vessel of war that was capable of high speeds and complex maneuvers. At nearly 40m in length, displacing almost 50 tonnes, {{it was more than}} three times as expensive as a two-level penteconter. A trireme also had an additional mast with a smaller square sail placed near the bow. Up to 170 oarsmen sat on three levels with one oar each that varied slightly in length. To accommodate three levels of oars, rowers sat staggered on three levels. Arrangements of the three levels are believed to have varied, but the most well-documented design made use of a projecting structure, or outrigger, where the <b>oarlock</b> {{in the form of a}} thole pin was placed. This allowed the outermost row of oarsmen enough leverage for full strokes that made efficient use of their oars.|$|E
500|$|Shen Kuo {{experimented with}} the pinhole camera and burning mirror as the ancient Chinese Mohists {{had done in}} the 4th century BC. Although the Iraqi Muslim {{scientist}} Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) {{was the first to}} experiment with camera obscura, Shen Kuo was the first to attribute geometrical and quantitative properties to the camera obscura, just several decades after Ibn al-Haytham's death. [...] Using a fitting metaphor, Shen compared optical image inversion to an <b>oarlock</b> and waisted drum. He also discussed focal points and noted that the image in a concave mirror is inverted. Shen, who never asserted that {{he was the first to}} experiment with camera obscura, hints in his writing that camera obscura was dealt with in the Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang written by Duan Chengshi (d. 863) during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), in regard to the inverted image of a Chinese pagoda by a seashore.|$|E

5000|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} is {{from modern}} times; they were granted on 16 June 1991. The arms shows two black <b>oarlocks</b> on a yellow background. <b>Oarlocks</b> {{are on the}} gunwale of a boat and they support the oar and give force to the rower's stroke. Some of these objects {{have been found in}} several places in Radøy and the artifacts date back to the first century BC. The designer of the arms was Even Jarl Skoglund.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, some of {{you boys}} are out pretty late nights," [...] {{observed}} Ike Rasmer, as he resumed his painting, and while Roger was adjusting the new <b>oarlock</b> to the gunwale of the Hall boat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure I will," [...] {{answered}} Ike Rasmer, with {{a twinkle}} in his eye. He threw down his paint brush and walked into his boathouse. [...] "Here you be, my boy!" [...] And he held up the parts of a broken <b>oarlock.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Ho, ho! That's one on me, sure enough." [...] The man slapped Dave on the shoulder. [...] "You Hall {{boys are}} the cute ones, ain't ye? Well, {{if you want}} a good <b>oarlock,</b> you shall have it," [...] and he brought forth a number, that Roger might make his selection. The senator's son did so, and paid for it out of his pocket-money.|$|E

50|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} is {{from modern}} times; they were granted on 13 November 1992. The arms show a black <b>oarlock</b> from a rowing boat on a yellow background. Fosnes is a coastal municipality and rowing boats {{were the main}} form of transportation in the former centuries.|$|E
50|$|A {{narrower}} boat {{provides a}} sharper {{angle to the}} bow and a smaller cross-sectional area reducing drag and wave drag, and avoiding hull speed limitations at race speed. The first racing shells, while narrower than working rowboats, were limited by the width necessary to mount the <b>oarlocks</b> on the boat's sides ("gunwales"). By attaching outriggers to the gunwales, the <b>oarlocks</b> could be placed farther out. This resulted in two things: oars got much longer, providing more length to the strokes, and hulls got narrower until they were as narrow as possible while still retaining sufficient buoyancy and balance.|$|R

Two brick piers {{supporting}} the large structure are visible. A small flat boat with paddles in the <b>oarlocks,</b> carrying crates and sacks, is moored off the rocky shore at bottom left...|$|R
50|$|While rowing, {{the athlete}} {{sits in the}} boat facing toward the stern, and uses the oars which are {{held in place by}} the <b>oarlocks</b> to propel the boat forward (towards the bow). This may be done on a canal, river, lake, sea, or other large bodies of water. The sport {{requires}} strong core balance, physical strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular endurance.|$|R
50|$|In rowing, oars {{are used}} to propel the boat. Oars differ from paddles in that they use a fixed fulcrum, an <b>oarlock</b> {{attached}} {{to the side of}} the boat, to transfer power from the handle to the blade, rather than using the athlete's shoulders or hands as the pivot-point as in canoeing and kayaking.|$|E
5000|$|The Old Norse form of {{the name}} was {{probably}} Hásvík. The first element is then the genitive case of the mountain name Hár (now Håen) and the last element is vík which means [...] "cove" [...] or [...] "wick". The actual name of the mountain is compared in form with an old <b>oarlock</b> (Old Norse: hár).|$|E
50|$|The {{boats were}} {{generally}} {{outfitted with a}} sprit or lug sailing rig and a small jib. The mast was generally unstayed. Early fisherman used an oar to steer with rather than bring a separate rudder. Modern sailing versions come with a separate rudder. But an <b>oarlock</b> can be mounted on the transom for use with an oar as a steering device.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of a {{small wooden}} ferry boat moored along the Colorado River {{in one of the}} Mojave canyons, California, 1900 - 1950. It is a flat boat {{containing}} several crates and full sacks and has an oar sitting in one of the <b>oarlocks.</b> The near shore is rocky. On the far shore, rough rocky hills are visible. Other rocky hills rise in the distance...|$|R
50|$|Sculls, or shells, were narrower, longer, {{and a lot}} faster. Gigs {{had their}} <b>oarlocks</b> mounted on the sides (like a rowboat), but sculls had them a couple feet outside the boat thanks to riggers, {{triangular}} braces that projected out from the sides. This increased the efficiency of every stroke, and led to much longer oars. Meanwhile, boats got longer and hulls got narrower, until they were as narrow as was possible while still retaining sufficient buoyancy and balance.|$|R
50|$|Longships {{were not}} fitted with benches. When rowing, the crew sat on sea chests (chests {{containing}} their personal possessions) {{that would otherwise}} take up space. The chests were made {{the same size and}} were the perfect height for a Viking to sit on and row. Longships had hooks for oars to fit into, but smaller oars were also used, with crooks or bends to be used as <b>oarlocks.</b> If there were no holes then a loop of rope kept the oars in place.|$|R
50|$|In sport rowing oarlocks were {{originally}} brass or bronze and open (no gate). With {{the advent of}} modern materials oarlocks are now injection moulded plastic and precision made to minimize play (slop) between the oar collar and the <b>oarlock.</b> The most recent sport racing oarlocks have a spring loaded feature to keeps the oar collar firmly against the pin at all times.|$|E
50|$|Sam Herring played Locke Ernst-Frost {{an arrogant}} narcissistic artist from Germany, Ohio, {{dressed in a}} 70's-inspired white suit with slicked-back hair, and a heavy German accent. The character's name {{originally}} {{was meant to be}} <b>Oarlock</b> Ernest Frost but it got shortened as a reference to John Locke the religious poet, Max Ernst, the artist and Robert Frost, the American poet.|$|E
50|$|The {{only other}} {{essential}} pieces of hardware are rowlocks (also known as oarlocks). Conventionally, a dinghy {{will have an}} oar on each side. A single sculling <b>oarlock</b> or notch on the transom is less common, but requires less space; and is used with a single sculling oar moving back and forth, never leaving the water, as used on a sampan.|$|E
50|$|The paddle is {{held with}} two hands, some {{distance}} apart from each other. For normal use, it is drawn {{through the water}} from front (bow) to back (stern) to drive the boat forwards. The two blades of a kayak paddle are dipped alternately {{on either side of}} the kayak. A paddle is distinguished from an oar in that the paddle is held in the user's hands and completely supported by the paddler, whereas an oar is primarily supported by the boat, through the use of <b>oarlocks.</b> Gloves may be worn to prevent blistering for long periods of paddling.|$|R

It is a flat boat containing several crates and full sacks. The oars stick up in the <b>oarlocks</b> on both sides. The near shore is dried cracked mud. On the far shore, brush and small trees can be seen. A sandbar(?) is visible in the placid water just off the opposite shore. Rough rocky hills are visible in the background. One of the hills was the site of the killing of a prospector by a Chemehuevi Indian...|$|R

At center, an outboard flat boat is moored to the shore with a rope tied around a rock {{at one end of the}} boat. The paddles stick up out of the <b>oarlocks</b> on both sides of the boat. There are boxes and other contents scattered within the body of the boat. In the foreground, the near shore consists of cracked dry mud. In the background, a finger of the near shore on the far side of the boat has small trees and bushes growing a short distance from the water's edge...|$|R
5000|$|A rowlock , {{sometimes}} spur (due to {{the similarity}} {{in shape and}} size), <b>oarlock</b> (USA) [...] or gate (Australia) is a brace that attaches an oar to a boat. When a boat is rowed, the rowlock acts as a fulcrum, and, in doing so, the propulsive force that the rower exerts on the water with the oar is transferred to the boat by the thrust force exerted on the rowlock.|$|E
50|$|SportBoats remain {{popular in}} the Great Lakes and midwest, and are a {{favorite}} of duck hunters, frequently camouflaged with the <b>oarlock</b> sockets removed to eliminate hang-ups in grass. Except on Alaskan rivers, Sport Boats are uncommon west of the Rockies. The University of Washington Aquatic Recreation Center has {{a dozen or so}} heavily used and extensively repaired SportBoats in its rowing fleet on Lake Washington at the Montlake Cut.|$|E
50|$|As the Art Lord, Sam Herring played Locke Ernst-Frost {{an arrogant}} narcissistic artist from Germany, Ohio, {{dressed in a}} 70's-inspired white suit with slicked-back hair, and a heavy German accent. He emerged in Greenville with the self-portraits he brought to life {{because they were the}} only ones good enough to be on a stage with him. The character's name {{originally}} was meant to be <b>Oarlock</b> Ernest Frost but it got shortened as a reference to John Locke the religious poet, Max Ernst, the artist and Robert Frost, the American poet.|$|E
5000|$|In watercraft, {{a racing}} shell (also {{referred}} to as just a fine boat (UK) or just shell) is an extremely narrow, and often comparatively long, rowing boat specifically designed for racing or exercise. It is outfitted with long oars, outriggers to hold the <b>oarlocks</b> away from the boat, and sliding seats. The boat's long length and semicircular cross-section reduce drag to a minimum. This makes the boat both fast and unstable. It must be balanced by the rowers to avoid tipping. Being able to balance -- or [...] "set" [...] -- the boat while putting maximum effort into the oars is therefore an essential skill of sport rowing.|$|R
5000|$|Forward-facing systems:Articulated or bow facing oars have two-piece oars {{and use a}} {{mechanical}} transmission to reverse {{the direction of the}} oar blade, enabling a seated rower to row facing forward with a pulling motion. Push rowing, also called back-watering if used in a boat not designed for forward motion, uses regular oars with a pushing motion to achieve forward-facing travel, sometimes seated and sometimes standing. This is a convenient method of manoeuvring in a narrow waterway or through a busy harbour. The [...] "Rantilla" [...] system of frontrowing oars uses inboard mounted <b>oarlocks</b> rather than a reversing transmission to achieve forward motion of the boat with a pulling motion on the oars.|$|R
5000|$|The Fatty Knees {{fibreglass}} sailing dinghies {{were designed}} by Lyle Hess (1912-2002). Produced in 7’ (2.1m), 8’ (2.4m) and 9’ (2.7m) long models. The 8’ model has a 4’ (1.2m) beam. Primarily designed as a yacht tender with good rowing and towing characteristics, the boat can be sailed, with enough width in the beam to provide stability. [...] The hull has a lapstrake appearance. The thwarts and dagger-board trunk are fiberglass inserts glassed into the hull and are watertight. It is cat rigged with a Bermuda mainsail. A transom notch allows sculling. Equipped with <b>oarlocks</b> for rowing. A small outboard motor can be mounted to port. Sailing gear {{is designed to be}} stored inside the hull. About 2000 dinghies have been produced.|$|R
