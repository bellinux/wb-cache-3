60|$|At sunset a {{military}} band of about seventy performers began playing {{in front of}} the Tuileries. They formed an immense circle, the leader in the centre. He played the <b>octave</b> <b>flute,</b> which also served as a baton for marking time. The music was characterized by delicacy, precision, suppression, and subjugation of rebellious material.|$|E
50|$|The alto in F4 is the {{standard}} recorder of the Baroque, {{although there is a}} small repertoire written for other sizes. In 17th-century England, smaller recorders were named for their relationship to the alto and notated as transposing instruments with respect to it: third flute (A4), fifth flute (soprano; C5), sixth flute (D5), and <b>octave</b> <b>flute</b> (sopranino; F5). The term flute du quart, or fourth flute (B4), was used by Charles Dieupart, although curiously he treated it as a transposing instrument in relation to the soprano rather than the alto. In Germanic countries, the equivalent of the same term, Quartflöte, was applied both to the tenor in C4, the interval being measured down from the alto in F4, and to a recorder in C5 (soprano), the interval of a fourth apparently being measured up from an alto in G4. Recorder parts in the Baroque were typically notated using the treble clef, although they may also be notated in French violin clef (G clef on the bottom line of the staff).|$|E

5000|$|Hamlin's first money making {{business}} was of selling {{all kinds of}} <b>flutes,</b> violins, flageolets, <b>octave</b> <b>flutes,</b> fifes and sheet music with his son (John) was first located {{directly across the street}} from the First Baptist Meetinghouse in Providence at 11 Cheapside in 1806-1809. Later he moved his business closer to the harbor eight doors south where he sold and repaired optical, nautical and mathematical instruments for the navigational industry. In 1824, Hamlin's {{business was}} listed as: [...] "Hamlin William, engraver and mathematical instrument maker, 135 South Main, 170 Benefit". [...] He was at 120 South Main in 1832, at 88 South Main in 1836, at 86 South Main in 1838, and at 69 South Water from 1841 to 1844. Thereafter, he relocated to 131 South Water Street, and the business was called [...] "At the Sign of the Quadrant" [...] advertising compasses, quadrants, sextants, spyglasses, telescopes, and microscopes. The business was there from 1847 until Hamlin's death in 1869. It was at this business that he became inspired to become an engraver. His first attempts at engraving were done on copper. Hamlin described himself strictly as a mathematical instrument maker after 1860, dropping the 'engraver' designation.|$|R
5000|$|The flute was {{the most}} popular wind {{instrument}} during the Sangam period. Perumpanarruppatai, one of the Pattupattu anthologies, describes the process of making the flute. The holes in the bamboo tube were bored using red-hot embers. The flute is also mentioned in the Kurincippattu as the instrument on which the shepherds played the ambal pann. Among the other wind instruments were the Pili, a small trumpet and Kanvidutumbu a larger flute [...] ), perhaps producing lower <b>octaves</b> The <b>flute</b> also acted as a drone providing a constant pitch for vocalists and other instruments 'as long as the trunk of an elephant'.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{approach}} to the fourth <b>octave</b> on the <b>flute.</b> The subject is looked at from three different perspectives: the physical, the historical and the technical one. First I investigated the characteristics {{and the limits of}} the instrument according to its construction. Then I had {{an approach to}} the fourth <b>octave</b> analyzing the <b>flute</b> repertoire. And last I read in flute treatises about the fourth octave and the fingerings. Then all those ideas were brought to the practice room where I experimented with the fourth octave and wrote about my experience. This work is expressed in this text, where also some musical examples of exercises that I have modified can be found and, moreover, there are four recordings made by myself. Three of them are a demonstration of those exercises and the fourth one {{is an example of a}} passage where the fourth octave can be found on a flute piece, this is Prokofiev's Sonata for flute and piano...|$|R
50|$|The Boehm {{system for}} the {{clarinet}} is a system of clarinet keywork, developed between 1839 and 1843 by Hyacinthe Klosé and Auguste Buffet jeune. The name is somewhat deceptive; the system was inspired by Theobald Boehm's {{system for the}} flute, but necessarily differs from it, since the clarinet overblows at the twelfth rather than the <b>flute's</b> <b>octave.</b> Boehm himself {{was not involved in}} its development.|$|R
50|$|The second {{movement}} ('Adagio di molto') is very lyrical. A short {{introduction by}} clarinets and oboes leads into a singing solo part (on the G string) over pizzicato strings. Dissonant accompaniments by the brass dominate {{the first part}} of the song-like movement. The middle section has the solo violin playing ascending broken <b>octaves,</b> with the <b>flute</b> as the main voice of the accompaniment, playing descending notes simultaneously. The movement ends with the strings restating the main theme on top of the solo violin.|$|R
