2500|$|There is a {{disturbance}} <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> {{and she takes}} her chance to escape by slipping out of the restroom and making {{her way to the}} exit and out into the underground parking lot. [...] She walks quickly out of the area and finds herself in the neighborhood to a job she had got from the Ty-Dee Girls agency she cancelled for that week. [...] Luckily for her the agency has yet to send her replacement and the woman who comes out of the house does not question her about her apparent lateness. [...] She is then brought into the house, instructed to serve lunch, and then be ready to depart the house so they can head to the country.|$|E
60|$|Ferris and Macklin {{jumped to}} their feet and both rushed <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b>|$|E
60|$|Tea was set <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> {{but only}} Engleton was there. Forrest and the Princess were walking slowly {{up and down}} the avenue.|$|E
5000|$|The English-French {{political}} tensions of Eastern Ontario played <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> of GDHS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s. This {{was captured}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> political {{study of the}} town written by University of Toronto political scientist David Rayside in his 1991 book, [...] "A Small Town in Modern Times." ...|$|R
60|$|Leaving Sam and Tubbs to {{take care}} of themselves, Tom left the bedroom and walked <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>hall</b> once more.|$|R
5000|$|Ruff's first {{sustained}} {{effort at}} a novel was a soap opera-like {{story about a}} family {{with a lot of}} children (as an only child, Ruff was fascinated by the concept of siblings). He wrote it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, but never published it. Describing it, Ruff said [...] "Think Eight Is Enough with surreal elements. There was no overall plot, just a series of loosely linked episodes—a chapter about the boys and girls digging competing tunnel systems under the house would be followed by one in which they got infected by some weird flu strain and started passing <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls.</b> Periodically I’d set aside what I’d written and start the whole thing over again".|$|R
60|$|A few of {{the boys}} from the other dormitories had been invited, and the boys took turns in {{standing}} <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> on guard.|$|E
60|$|Again she listened. She gave {{a little}} hoarse cry, and Wingrave started. <b>Out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> a girl's clear laugh rang like a note of music to their ears.|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned and}} walked <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> he passed Lord Nunneley. [...] "We have {{arranged}} it according to your wish, sir," [...] he said, [...] "your daughter and I." ...|$|E
50|$|Gary Tyler is one {{of eleven}} {{children}} of Juanita and Uylos Tyler of St. Rose, Louisiana. His father was a maintenance worker who sometimes held three jobs; his mother worked as a domestic. His father died in 1989 of heart trouble. Tyler and his siblings attended local schools, which were segregated into the 1970s. When he was 16, he began to take the bus to Destrehan High School. Previously all-white, the school had conducted court-ordered desegregation since 1968, bussing black students to <b>the</b> school. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> school sessions <b>in</b> 1974, racial tensions had been rising, with fights breaking <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> and at games. The white community continued to resist desegregation and black students were harassed at the school by white students.|$|R
50|$|The first warden, James A. Johnston, always entered <b>the</b> dining <b>hall</b> {{alone and}} unarmed, due to heavy {{guarding}} around him. Several riots did break <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dining <b>hall</b> during Alcatraz's history. Those prisoners {{who were not}} involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fighting hid under <b>the</b> dining <b>hall</b> tables to escape possible retribution.|$|R
50|$|Today, <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> {{is serving}} again as an {{exhibition}} hall {{and is a}} popular venue for concerts by numerous prominent artists. During the International Motor Show Daimler AG traditionally occupies the Festhalle for the presentation of their Mercedes-Benz motor cars. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{first half of the}} 1990s the ATP World Championship was carried <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> banquet <b>hall.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a {{wonderful}} woman," [...] said Sergeant Cuff, {{when we were}} <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> again. [...] "But for her self-control, the mystery that puzzles you, Mr. Betteredge, {{would have been at}} an end to-night." ...|$|E
60|$|Larry's quick gesture enjoined silence. Stealthy steps sounded <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> They revived Allie's fear of Durade and his men. It {{struck her}} {{suddenly}} that Larry must be {{ignorant of the}} circumstances that had placed her there.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> {{part of the}} time, and I saw a dark {{figure in}} the rear hallway prowling around in a most {{suspicious}} manner. It went into Dormitory No. 3 and then came out and disappeared toward the back stairs." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{attention}} of the guard had already been attracted by the sudden burst of light by the barns. They had heard distant shouts, and deemed that a conflagration had broken <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> banqueting <b>hall.</b> Not doubting for an instant the truth of Grahame's story, they lowered the drawbridge instantly, and Sir John and his companions rushed across.|$|R
50|$|In January 1982, {{an escaped}} {{prisoner}} was found hiding <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> residence <b>hall.</b> Barry Lauderdale had been sentenced in Boonville {{to two years}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state penitentiary, but he escaped through a fourth floor window of University Hospital {{where he had been}} brought for an examination. University police apprehended the prisoner and escorted him <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> building <b>in</b> leg irons.|$|R
60|$|Carrie {{contrived}} {{to quiet}} him, {{though she did}} not find it easy. When at last {{he had gone to}} sleep she went <b>out,</b> meeting Gallwey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> He glanced at her with a little sympathetic smile.|$|R
60|$|Before Norah could answer, she was summoned, in {{compliance}} with Mr. Clare's request, to the conference with the servants. Mr. Pendril followed Miss Garth, {{as a matter of}} course. When the three were <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> Mr. Clare re-entered the room, closed the door, and signed peremptorily to Magdalen to take a chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} that I'm afraid to say it. Here; give me some wine. You'll take some more. No? Well; shall we go? I am afraid to say it." [...] They were now <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> {{standing}} idly there, with their backs to another door. [...] "I wonder what answer you would make me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was--in {{the other}} room. But I {{was a doctor}} <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> and a {{sculptor}} on the stairs, so I'm getting sort of confused myself--as confused as you are, trying to remember who I am, Miss Winslow. You really don't remember me at all? Tea at--wasn't it at the Vanderbilt? or the Plaza?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When I {{was shut}} <b>out</b> with her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> she said, holding up her hands, [...] "Oh, if you please, miss, Mr. Carstone says {{would you come}} upstairs to Mr. Skimpole's room. He has been took, miss!" ...|$|R
50|$|Camp Ramah in Glen Spey {{was located}} in Lumberland, 2 mi from the Delaware River. It opened in 1967 and closed in 1971. On June 16, 1976, a fire broke <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen-dining <b>hall</b> and {{destroyed}} many buildings. The Lumberland Fire Department burned the rest of <b>the</b> camp down <b>in</b> 1982 as a training exercise, {{to ensure the safety}} and integrity of the towns people around them.|$|R
6000|$|Courtlaw was dismissed. As {{he passed}} <b>out</b> he saw <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> a quietly dressed man with keen grey eyes, {{talking to one}} of the footmen. He shivered and looked behind as he stepped into his hansom. Had it come already? ...|$|R
6000|$|The Canon rose. [...] "Believe me, Edward, I sympathise deeply. I felt I had to warn you." [...] He {{held out}} his hand. [...] "Good-bye, my dear friend, do forgive me"; and he went <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> an {{adventure}} befell him so plump, and awkward, that he could barely recite it to Mrs. Rushbourne that night.|$|E
60|$|Peggy and I {{were up in}} the {{south-west}} room at dusk that evening, piecing a quilt, when {{we heard}} Mr. Malcolm MacPherson shouting <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> below to know if anyone was home. I ran out to the landing, but as I did so Aunt Olivia {{came out of her}} room, brushed past me, and flitted downstairs.|$|E
6000|$|His second start was favoured {{with greater}} luck, {{and he found}} himself <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> and {{presently}} in the cool air of the night, with the stars shining down on him. Had those silent stars ever shone down on a more broken-hearted man? Had the cool air of the night ever fanned a more fevered brow? Ah, yes! Or, rather, ah no! ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hall</b> is <b>the</b> site of {{the annual}} Nobel Banquet, held every December 10. This banquet is [...] "the most sought-after social {{invitation}} in Sweden", attended by the Swedish Royal Family, government ministers, parliamentarians, and over 1200 invited guests. Following the banquet, guests repair to <b>the</b> Golden <b>Hall,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same complex, for dancing. The Nobel Prizes are not handed <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Blue <b>Hall,</b> but are given out earlier at <b>the</b> Stockholm Concert <b>Hall</b> at Hötorget.|$|R
60|$|A babel of talk broke <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great <b>hall,</b> {{and with}} it some vivas and {{clapping}} of hands, for Hugh had spoken boldly and well; moreover, the spectators read truth in his grey eyes. A dark figure in priest's robe--it was that of Father Nicholas, the secretary who had brewed Red Eve's potion--glided up to Cattrina and whispered swiftly in his ear. Then the Doge lifted his hand and there was silence.|$|R
50|$|At about 22:50 fire broke <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tenerife party <b>hall</b> when <b>the</b> party decorations caught fire. Fifteen {{people died}} and 164 people were {{severely}} injured. Dutch singer Lee Towers {{was one of}} the guests at the party, he escaped unscathed but his wife Laura got severe burns.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} the red tiled floor of the {{entrance}} hall; he stared through the hall into an immense lounge with the largest and softest chairs in the world, with oil portraits of distinguished old bucks, and ninety per cent. of the wealth and power of Seattle pulling its several mustaches, reading the P.I., and ignoring the lone intruder <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b>|$|E
60|$|Griffiths {{hesitated for}} a single moment. He had the {{appearance}} of a man half demented by a passion which could find no outlet. Then he left the room, without salute, without a glance to the right or to the left. <b>Out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> a moment later, they heard a harsh voice of command. The hall door was opened and closed behind the sound of retreating footsteps.|$|E
6000|$|When Miss Sally came back, she was {{attended}} by Juliana carrying a tray of lemonade glasses. Juliana {{proved to be a}} diminutive lass of about fourteen whose cheerful, freckled face wore an expansive grin of pleasure. Evidently Juliana was as fond of [...] "company" [...] as her mistress was. Afterwards, the girls overheard a subdued colloquy between Miss Sally and Juliana <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1980s, an {{organization}} called Artists Assistance Services rented <b>out</b> apartments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bretton <b>Hall</b> to people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arts, with the unusual proviso {{that they would have}} to share the use of the space with a [...] "cultural activity" [...] such as a karate class.|$|R
60|$|While I {{was walking}} down to dinner with Lord Shaftesbury, he pointed <b>out</b> to me <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>the</b> {{portrait}} of his distinguished ancestor, Antony Ashley Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury, whose name he bears. This ancestor, notwithstanding his sceptical philosophy, did some good things, as he {{was the author of}} the habeas corpus act.|$|R
6000|$|... “Still, {{the tickets}} {{will have been}} sold, {{and if it does}} rain the people who can’t get into the big billiard room can sit <b>out</b> <b>in</b> couples <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> which will {{probably}} please them just as well. We, however, mean to have it outside if we can. We want the limelights for the tableaux and costume dancing.” ...|$|R
