5|$|The {{book was}} met with mostly {{positive}} reviews from critics, approving its description <b>of</b> <b>math</b> while praising its simplicity. Its colorful use of fictional mathematical terms and its creative descriptions of concepts have made it a suggested book for both children and adults troubled with math. The Number Devil was a bestseller in Europe, and has been translated into English by Michael Henry Heim.|$|E
5|$|The ten events require {{knowledge}} in many academic disciplines. Students must take seven multiple choice tests in art, economics, language and literature, math, music, science and social science. These topics, {{with the exception}} <b>of</b> <b>math,</b> are thematically linked each year. One of the multiple choice events, alternating between science or social science, is chosen for the Super Quiz. In addition to the seven objective events, there are three subjective events graded by judges: essay, interview and speech.|$|E
5|$|As of the 2009–10 school year, {{students}} are required to complete 23Carnegie units of a college-preparatory curriculum to graduate, including 4 units of English, 2 units of foreign language, 3 units <b>of</b> <b>math,</b> 1 unit of world history, 1 unit of US history, 3 units of lab science, 4 units of religion, 1.5 units of physical education, and 5 five units of electives. Spanish, French, German, and Latin are offered as foreign languages. Every summer since 1997, an English teacher has offered a one-week summer course in writing and photography. The school offers neither vocational nor remedial courses.|$|E

5|$|Gerty Theresa Radnitz {{was born}} into a Jewish family in Prague in 1896. Her father, Otto Radnitz, was a chemist who became manager of sugar {{refineries}} after inventing a successful method for refining sugar. Her mother, Martha, a friend of Franz Kafka, was a culturally sophisticated woman. Gerty was tutored at home before enrolling in a Lyceum for girls, and at the age of 16 she decided {{she wanted to be a}} medical doctor. Pursuing the study of science, Gerty learned that she lacked the prerequisites in Latin, physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Over the course of a year, she managed to study the equivalent of eight years of Latin, five years of science, and five years <b>of</b> <b>math.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Boston Public Schools enroll 57,000 {{students}} attending 145 schools, including the renowned Boston Latin Academy, John D. O'Bryant School <b>of</b> <b>Math</b> & Science, and Boston Latin School. The Boston Latin School {{was established in}} 1635 and is the oldest public {{high school in the}} US. Boston also operates the United States' second-oldest public high school and its oldest public elementary school. The system's students are 40% Hispanic or Latino, 35% Black or African American, 13% White, and 9% Asian. There are private, parochial, and charter schools as well, and approximately 3,300 minority students attend participating suburban schools through the Metropolitan Educational Opportunity Council.|$|E
5|$|The {{events are}} split up into two groups: the seven {{objective}} tests (art, economics, language and literature, math, music, science and social science) the three subjective events (essay, interview and speech). In addition, {{there is a}} SuperQuiz relay event. The former seven are given as half-hour multiple choice tests, whereas the latter three are graded by judges. The multiple choice exams consist of 50 questions each, with the exception <b>of</b> <b>math,</b> which has 35 questions. Beginning in the 2012-2013 season, the SuperQuiz written test was dropped and the oral relay was changed to include questions from six of the objective subjects: art, economics, language and literature, music, science, and social science.|$|E

5|$|Fundraising {{efforts were}} led by Achsah M. Ely, {{a member of the}} college's class of 1868 and a {{professor}} <b>of</b> <b>math</b> at the school from 1887–1904. Donations came {{from a variety of sources}} including students attending the college (the class of 1889 donated a total of $148), student groups (the Philaletheis Society, the college's student dramatic organization, contributed $41 dollars in the hopes it could use the building once completed), trustees, and alumnae and their families. By June 1887, the college had raised between $18,000–20,000 and so hired architect William Tubby to design the new hall. Tubby returned to the college with estimates from Poughkeepsie builders ranging in cost from $39,997–50,000, higher than the available budget. The Vassar Board of Trustees formed a subcommittee and attempted to find solutions, including modifying Tubby's designs. The subcommittee received estimates from builders outside of Poughkeepsie (in Kingston, Brooklyn, Troy, and Albany) but the lowest was still above budget at $32,000.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of the ten}} {{events is}} worth 1,000 points, for a {{possible}} 10,000-point individual total. Only the top two scores from the Honors, Scholastic and Varsity divisions are counted for the team score. Until 2013, 60,000 was the maximum possible team score. In 2013, Super Quiz became a 10,000 point event that only counts for the team score, making the maximum possible team score 70,000. With the exception <b>of</b> <b>math</b> and Super Quiz, the objective tests each have 50 questions worth 20 points a piece. The math test is weighted more heavily, with 35 questions worth approximately 28.6 points per question. Until 2013, the Super Quiz written test contained 40 questions, each worth 15 points. Depending on the state director, the relay component of Super Quiz contained either 5 or 10 questions, each worth 80 or 40 points respectively. Starting in 2013, the Super Quiz contained only the relay component with 5 or 10 questions, each worth approximately 333.3 or 166.7 questions respectively. The written test was sometimes omitted {{at the state level}} even before 2013 if a state director wished to weigh the Super Quiz Relay more heavily. Perfect scores of 1,000 in events are recorded regularly, and there have been cases of dozens of medal winners for a single event because of perfect and near-perfect scores. Gold, silver and bronze medals are awarded in each event and for each division (Honors, Scholastic, and Varsity). All tying participants are awarded medals.|$|E
