5|$|Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited (Baxter), was the Australian {{subsidiary}} of the multinational health care company Baxter International. Baxter manufactured intravenous (IV) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids at various plants in Australia.

Its monopoly covered large volume parenteral fluids, irrigating solutions and parenteral nutrition fluids. However, Baxter faced competition in the market for peritoneal dialysis fluids (PD fluids).|$|E

5|$|During the British Iron Age {{the area}} became the southernmost {{territory}} of the Pennine tribe called the Brigantes. It is this tribe who in around 500 BC {{are thought to have}} constructed the hill fort that stands on the summit of a steep hill above the River Don at Wincobank, in what is now northeastern Sheffield. Other Iron Age hill forts in the area are Carl Wark on Hathersage Moor to the southwest of Sheffield, and one at Scholes Wood, near Rotherham.

In December 2002, one of Abergil's main rivals, underworld kingpin Ze'ev Rosenstein, was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to assassinate both Abergils. In 2007, Police learned that at least two contract killers, believed to be from the Commonwealth of Independent States, had come to Israel at the behest <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rival</b> crime family embroiled in a vendetta with the Abergil crime syndicate. The police believed the two hit men to be hired by the competing Alperon crime family.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s Bradbury {{oversaw the}} {{development}} of thermonuclear weapons, although a falling out with Edward Teller over the priority given to their development {{led to the creation}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rival</b> nuclear weapons laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. In later years, he branched out, constructing the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility to develop the laboratory's role in nuclear science, and during the Space Race of the 1960s, the laboratory developed the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). The Bradbury Science Museum is named in his honor.|$|E

5|$|In the {{campaign}} mode, {{the objective of}} each level is the acquisition of the Portal Gem, usually {{in the possession of}} the heroic guardian of the realm, although it is sometimes in the possession <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rival</b> keeper. Whoever has the Portal Gem must be defeated, so Horny can enter and claim it. The final level involves defeating King Reginald, overlord of the entire realm of Harmonia. Some levels have more specific conditions relating to this goal: for example, there is one level in which the player races against the clock to obtain the Portal Gem in the possession <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rival</b> keeper before the heroes invade and try to do the same. If the heroes recover the Portal Gem, the player loses. Other game modes include My Pet Dungeon and Skirmish. In My Pet Dungeon, the player constructs a dungeon without campaign-style objectives, and can control if, when, and how heroes invade. Instead, there are criteria based on the dungeon composition and related activities, and there is no requirement to proceed to the next level on completion. Skirmish involves competing against computer-controlled rival keepers, and the player can customize conditions such as which rooms and spells are available. Multiplayer is supported over IPX and TCP/IP and is otherwise similar to Skirmish. A patch added elite creatures (stronger than their normal counterparts) to the latter three modes. Elite creatures are attracted by constructing rooms with very specific tile arrangements.|$|E
5|$|While {{recording}} Doggystyle with Dr. Dre in August 1993, Snoop Dogg {{was arrested}} {{in connection with the}} death of Phillip Woldermarian, a member <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rival</b> gang who was shot and killed in a gang fight. According to the charges, the rapper's bodyguard, McKinley Lee, shot Woldermarian as Snoop Dogg drove the vehicle; the rapper claimed it was self-defense, alleging the victim was stalking him. He spent most of 1995 preparing the case which went to trial in late-1995. He was cleared of all charges in February 1996 when he began working on his second album, Tha Doggfather.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 {{has been put}} forward as {{evidence}} of cannibalism in the genus Tyrannosaurus. They studied some Tyrannosaurus specimens with tooth marks in the bones, attributable to the same genus. The tooth marks were identified in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed {{it would be difficult}} to reach down to bite in the feet <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rival,</b> making it more likely that the bite marks were made in a carcass. As the bite marks were made in body parts with relatively scanty amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the Tyrannosaurus was feeding on a carcass in which the more fleshy parts had already been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced cannibalism. Other evidence for cannibalism has been unearthed.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the advent}} of {{anatomical}} physical modernity cannot confidently be linked with palaeoneurological change, it does seem probable that hominid brains evolved through the same selection processes as other body parts. Genes that promoted a capacity for symbolism may have been selected for, suggesting that the foundations for symbolic culture may well be grounded in biology. However, behavior that was mediated by symbolism may have only come later, even though this physical capacity was already in place much earlier. Skoyles and Sagan, for example, argue that human brain expansion by increasing the prefrontal cortex would have created a brain capable of symbolizing its previously non-symbolic cognition, and that this process, slow to begin with, increasingly accelerated during the last 100,000 years. Symbolically mediated behavior may then feed back upon this process by creating a greater ability to manufacture symbolic artifacts and social networks. According to the research team in Jebel Irhoud, the discovery means that Homo sapiens — not members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rival</b> or ancestor species (Homo heidelbergensis, Homo naledi) — {{were the ones who}} left behind Middle Stone Age hand tools that have since been unearthed all over Africa.|$|E
5|$|At the 5th National Congress, the Lê Duẩn/Lê Đức Thọ clique amassed {{considerable}} {{power by}} staffing the 5th Central Committee, the 5th Secretariat and the 5th Politburo {{with their own}} supporters. Several moderates and old companions of Hồ Chí Minh, as well as pro-Chinese communists (labelled dismissively as Maoists) and followers of Trường Chinh, {{were removed from the}} Politburo and the Central Committee. The most prominent ouster was that of Võ Nguyên Giáp, the commander at the Battle of Diên Biên Phu. Giáp's removal signaled more the defeat <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rival</b> than of an ideological tendency. Nguyễn Duy Trinh and Lê Thanh Nghị were removed from the Politburo because of their moderate stances, while Trần Quốc Hoàn, Lê Văn Lương and Nguyễn Văn Linh were removed because of their alignment with Trường Chinh. In their place Lê Duẩn and Lê Đức Thọ appointed military men, including Đỗ Mười, Lê Đức Anh and General Đồng Sĩ Nguyên. The appointment of Nguyễn Đức Tâm and Nguyễn Cơ Thach strengthened Lê Đức Thọ. The Lê Duẩn/Lê Đức Thọ clique thereafter had a clear majority within the 5th Secretariat.|$|E
5|$|Hieronymus, in 2009, {{concluded}} that the nasal and supraorbital bosses were used for butting or ramming the head or the flank <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rival.</b> The bone structure indicates that the bosses were covered by cornified pads as in modern muskoxen, suggesting dominance fights {{similar to those of}} members of the Caprinae subfamily. In the latter group, an evolutionary transition can be observed, where the originally straight horns become more robust, padded, and increasingly curved downwards. The evolution from horncores into bosses in Centrosaurinae would likewise have reflected a change in fighting technique, from clashing to high-energy head-butting. Head-butting would have been an expensive and risky behavior. Opponents would only have engaged this way after assessing each other's strengths visually. For this reason, Hieronymus considered it unlikely that the bosses served for species recognition as this was already guaranteed by the innate species-specific display rituals preceding a real – instead of a ritual – fight. The bosses would have evolved for actual combat, part of a social selection in which individuals competed for scarce resources such as mates, food and breeding grounds.|$|E

5|$|In 1529, El Salvador became {{embroiled in}} a {{jurisdictional}} dispute with neighbouring Nicaragua. Pedrarias Dávila sent Martín de Estete {{at the head of}} an expedition to annex the territory to Nicaragua. Estete captured the leader <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rival</b> Spanish expedition in eastern El Salvador, and marched on San Salvador, before being repulsed by a relief force sent from Guatemala. In 1530, Pedro de Alvarado ordered the establishment of a new settlement at San Miguel, in the east of the country, to protect against further incursions from Nicaragua, and to assist in the conquest of the surrounding area. Indigenous uprisings against the invaders continued, spreading from neighbouring Honduras. The general uprising across the two provinces was put down by the end of 1538, and by 1539 the province was considered pacified. The conquistadores discovered that there was little gold or silver to be found in El Salvador, and it became a colonial backwater with a small Spanish population, within the jurisdiction of the Captaincy General of Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|In 1878, {{the club}} merged with Stoke Victoria Athletic Club and {{became known as}} Stoke Football Club. They moved from Sweetings Field to the Athletic Club ground, which soon {{became known as the}} Victoria Ground. It was around this time that the club adopted their red and white striped kit. Stoke entered the newly formed Birmingham Association Cup in 1881, {{although}} they were beaten 8–0 by Aston Villa in the first round. In the 1882–1883 season, Stoke reached the final of the Staffordshire Senior Cup but were beaten 3–2 by West Bromwich Albion. The club decided to enter the FA Cup {{for the first time in}} the 1883–84 season; the competition itself had been founded 12 years earlier. The threat <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rival</b> football association, the British FA, forced the Football Association to legalise professionalism in 1885; Stoke subsequently turned professional in August of that year. The club were defeated again in the FA Cup in 1885–86 after a replay defeat to Crewe Alexandra. The club's first victory in the competition came in the 1886–87 season with a 10–0 win over Caernarfon Wanderers at the Victoria Ground.|$|E
5|$|In late 1902, the PC plans {{collapsed}} after {{a falling}} {{out between the}} scheme's promoters led to {{a crucial part of}} the planned route coming under the control <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rival,</b> the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), which withdrew it from parliamentary consideration. With the PC scheme out of the way, the CLR resubmitted its bill in 1903, although consideration was again held up by Parliament's establishment of a Royal Commission on London Traffic tasked to assess the manner in which transport in London should be developed. While the Commission deliberated, any review of bills for new lines and extensions was postponed, so the CLR withdrew the bill. The CLR briefly re-presented the bill for the 1905 parliamentary session but withdrew it again, before making an agreement with the UERL in October 1905 that neither company would submit a bill for an east–west route in 1906. The plan was then dropped as the new trains with driving positions at both ends made it possible for the CLR to reduce the minimum interval between trains to two minutes without building the loop.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to conservative pressure to constrain Röhm, Hitler left for Neudeck {{to meet with}} Hindenburg. Blomberg, who had been meeting with the President, uncharacteristically reproached Hitler for not having moved against Röhm earlier. He then told Hitler that Hindenburg was close to declaring martial law and turning the government over to the Reichswehr if Hitler did not take immediate steps against Röhm and his brownshirts. Hitler had hesitated for months in moving against Röhm, {{in part due to}} Röhm's visibility as the leader of a national militia with millions of members. However, the threat of a declaration of martial law from Hindenburg, the only person in Germany with the authority to potentially depose the Nazi regime, put Hitler under pressure to act. He left Neudeck with the intention of both destroying Röhm and settling scores with old enemies. Both Himmler and Göring welcomed Hitler's decision, since both had much to gain by Röhm's downfall– the independence of the SS for Himmler, and the removal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rival</b> for the future command of the army for Göring.|$|E
5|$|Male {{grasshoppers}} {{spend much}} of the day stridulating, singing more actively under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified in the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rival</b> male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby. In male grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{broke down}} {{once more in}} 1067 with the {{ascension}} of Emperor Shenzong of Song, and in the 1070s the Song had considerable success in capturing Tangut territory. A mood of frontier adventurism permeated Shenzong's court, {{as well as a}} desire to reclaim territories he felt belonged to him as the rightful ruler of China; when a Song general led an unprovoked attack on a Western Xia border town, Shenzong appeared at the border to commend the general himself. To punish the Western Xia and damage their economy, Emperor Shenzong also shut down all commercial border markets along the Song-Western Xia border. The scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095) was sent to Yanzhou (now Yan'an, Shaanxi province) in 1080 to stave off Tangut military invasion. He successfully defended his fortified position, yet the new Grand Councillor Cai Que held him responsible for the death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rival</b> Song military officer and the decimation of that officer's forces; as a result, Shen Kuo was ousted from office and the state abandoned the projected land that Shen was able to defend.|$|E
