40|$|AbstractGiven {{a network}} modeled by a {{probabilistic}} graph G=(V,E) with bounds on the operation probabilities of edges and of pairs of edges, the second order two-terminal reliability {{problem is to}} find best possible bounds on the probability of an <b>operating</b> <b>path</b> between two given nodes s and t without assuming independence of failures. An exact column generation method is proposed {{to solve this problem}} as well as several variants of it. The auxiliary problem is to find an optimum (s−t) -connected (or (s−t) -disconnected) subgraph and is strongly NP-hard. This is also the case for the quadratic shortest path problem and for the quadratic minimum cut problem considered by Assous (Networks 16 (1986) 319 – 329) in heuristics for the second order two-terminal reliability problem. Tabu search heuristics and row generation integer programming algorithms are proposed for solving the auxiliary problem. Computational results are provided for examples from the literature...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} an {{industrial}} multicomponent heterogeneous azeotropic distillation is presented. The process concerns an organic acid dehydration using an immiscible entrainer. First, a {{validation of the}} MESH and thermodynamic models through a comparison between pilot-plant experimental reconciled data and simulation results is conducted. A four-component mixture is considered for the simulation. Case studies of the boiler heat duty are automatically generated by an <b>operating</b> <b>path</b> tool. An ¥/¥ analysis is performed for the heterogeneous azeotropic pilot column and an industrial column with a decanter. Because of practical constraints, the pilot and the industrial columns {{do not have the}} same reflux policies. This leads the ¥/¥ analysis to predict multiple steady states for the industrial unit but not for the pilot column. However, multiple steady states are found by simulation both for the pilot and for the industrial unit. Multiple steady states are confirmed by simulation and experimental data for the industrial unit. Because of the positive ¥/¥ analysis, they are attributed to the phase equilibrium properties of the quaternary system. For the pilot column, multiple steady states are found by the simulation and linked to experimental observations. The multiplicity is not caused by the phase equilibrium properties; rather, it is attributed to interactions between the material and energy balances. An analysis of the simulation results helps explain the behavior of the industrial unit: the temperature of the sensitive tray gives rise to a peak in heat. This peak is located very close to the industrial temperature set point and is correlated with an impurity content minimum in the main product stream. An impurity minimum is also evidenced by the simulation for the pilot column. This complex behavior can explain observed difficulties in controlling the process at the industrial set point...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Meeting {{power and}} {{performance}} requirement is a challenging task in high speed ALUs. Supply voltage scaling is promising because it reduces both switching and active power {{but it also}} degrades robustness. Recently, researchers have proposed novel design technique for linear time complexity adders that maintain high yield and high clock frequency even at scaled supply voltage. The idea {{is based on the}} fact that the critical paths of arithmetic units are exercised rarely. The technique (a) predicts the set of critical paths, (b) reduces the supply voltage to <b>operate</b> non-critical <b>paths</b> at rated frequency, and; (c) avoids possible delay failures in the critical paths by dynamically stretching the clock period (to say, two-cycles assuming all standard operations are single-cycle), when they are activated. This allows circuits to operate at scaled supply with minimal performance degradation. The off-critical <b>paths</b> <b>operate</b> in single clock cycle while critical <b>paths</b> are <b>operated</b> in stretched clock period. Different classe...|$|R
