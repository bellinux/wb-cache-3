30|$|Cunninghamia lanceolata wood meal samples with {{different}} lignin contents after delignification with an acidic NaClO 2 system were carboxymethylated, {{and the degree}} of substitution (DS) and the distribution of the carboxymethyl (CM) groups were investigated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) spectroscopy. Cellulose samples prepared from bleached kraft softwood pulp, food-grade konjac mannan, and commercial <b>oat</b> <b>xylan</b> (containing 10 % arabinosyl and 15 % glucosyl residues) were also investigated. The chemical shift of methylene protons in 1 H NMR spectra of CM groups of carboxymethyl konjac mannan and commercial <b>oat</b> <b>xylan</b> appeared in the same region as those of carboxymethylcellulose. The DS of carboxymethyl lignocellulose (CMLC) increased slightly from 1.36 to 1.48 with decreasing lignin content, but the water solubility of CMLC clearly increased with decreasing lignin content. It was suggested that the covalent linkages between lignin and cell-wall polysaccharides play the role of cross-linker in CMLC. Water absorbents were synthesized by graft-copolymerization of acrylic acid onto CMLC samples {{with different}} lignin contents. The highest level of water absorbency was obtained from CMLC containing 14 % of lignin, suggesting the importance of lignin as the cross-linker.|$|E

Only <b>oat</b> spelt <b>xylan,</b> RBB-xylan and birchwood xylan reacted with endoxylanases with the maximum specific activity of 47. 65 U mg- 1 protein on birchwood xylan. The endoxylanase remained stable up to 70 ° C. At 60 ° C endoxylanase activity showed stability (92 %) for 16 h, however it showed a half-life of 8 h at 70 ° C and 30 min at 80 ° C {{in the absence of}} substrate at pH 8. 0. The relative endoxylanase activity in the pH ranges of 6. 5 to 9. 5 remained between 68 % and 72 % of the activity at pH 8. 0. The apparent Km value for the crude endoxylanase was 6. 66 mg of <b>oat</b> spelt <b>xylan</b> ml- 1, while the Vmax value was 2. 5 m mol reducing sugar min- 1 ml- 1. Endoxylanase activity was affected by the addition of xylobiose (1 mM) to the reaction mixture of endoxylanase preparation and resulted in approximately 25 % reduction in activity. Also, the addition of supernatant fluids from cultures grown on xylan (reducing sugar concentration of 1 mg ml- 1 xylose equivalent) to the reaction mixture resulted in approximately 30 % reduction in activity...|$|R
40|$|The mode {{of action}} of {{xylanase}} and beta-glucosidase purified from the culture filtrate of Humicola lanuginosa (Griffon and Maublanc) Bunce on the xylan extracted from sugarcane bagasse and on two commercially available larchwood and <b>oat</b> spelt <b>xylans,</b> on xylooligomers and on arabinoxylooligomers was studied. While larchwood and <b>oat</b> spelt <b>xylans</b> were hydrolyzed {{to the same extent}} in 24 h, sugarcane bagasse xylan was hydrolyzed to a lesser extent in the same period. It was found that the rate of hydrolysis of xylooligomers by xylanase increased with increase in chain length, while beta-glucosidase acted rather slowly on all the oligomers tested. Xylanase exhibited predominant ''endo'' action on xylooligomers attacking the xylan chain at random while beta-glucosidase had ''exo'' action, releasing one xylose residue at a time. On arabinoxylooligomers, however, xylanase exhibited ''exo'' action. Thus, it appears that the presence of the arabinose substituent has, in some way, rendered the terminal xylose-xylose linkage more susceptible to xylanase action. It was also observed that even after extensive hydrolysis with both the enzymes, substantial amounts of the parent arabinoxylooligomer remained unhydrolyzed together with the accumulation of arabinoxylobiose. It can therefore be concluded that the presence of the arabinose substituent in the xylan chain results in linkages that offer resistance to both xylanase and beta-glucosidase action...|$|R
40|$|Microorganisms {{producing}} xylanase {{were screened}} for the enzymatic production of xylo-oligosaccharides from xylan. One {{of the bacteria}} isolated from compost produced an endoxylanase extracellularly. The bacterium was identified as Bacillus sp. according to its taxonomic characteristics examined. Xylanase production reached upto 5 U/ml after 22 h of culture in LB medium at 30 °C. The xylanase was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration. The molecular weight of the xylanase {{was estimated to be}} 20, 400 by SDS-PAGE. Optimal temperature and pH for the xylanase activity was 60 °C and 6. 5, respectively. The enzyme was stable at temperatures upto 40 °C and pH values from 4 to 10. The xylanase was completely inhibited by the addition of 2 mM mercury ion. Apparent Km and Vmax values for <b>oat</b> spelt <b>xylan</b> were 9. 2 mg/ml and 1954 U/mg protein, respectively. For birchwood xylan, the values were 6. 3 mg/ml and 1009 U/mg protein. The predominant products of the xylan hydrolysis were xylobiose, xylotriose and xylotetraose, indicating that the enzyme is an endoxylanase. Upto 85 % of the initially added enzyme (2 U/ml) was bound to 50 mg/ml of the insoluble fraction of <b>oat</b> spelt <b>xylan</b> after incubation at 30 °C for 30 min. ope...|$|R
30|$|Xylanase {{activity}} {{was determined by}} measuring the release of reducing sugar from soluble xylan using the DNS method (Miller 1959). In brief, 0.9  ml buffer A (10  mg/ml <b>oat</b> spelt <b>xylan</b> in 50  mM sodium-phosphate buffer at pH 7) were mixed with 0.1  ml of the recovered enzyme solution (1  mg/ml). After incubation at 55  °C for 10  min, the reaction was terminated by adding 1.5  ml of the DNS reagent (Maalej et al. 2009). The mixture was then boiled for 5  min and cooled. Absorption was measured at 540  nm.|$|R
