5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that for an icy satellite the size of Mimas or Enceladus to enter an 'excited state' of tidal heating and convection, it would need to enter an orbital resonance before it lost too much of its primordial internal heat. Because Mimas, being smaller, would cool more rapidly than Enceladus, its window <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> initiating orbital resonance-driven convection would have been considerably shorter.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} power vacuums in {{the weeks}} following the Japanese surrender, created an atmosphere of uncertainty, but also one <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> the Republicans. Many pemuda joined pro-Republic struggle groups (badan perjuangan). The most disciplined were soldiers from the Japanese-formed but disbanded Giyugun (PETA) and Heiho groups. Many groups were undisciplined, due to both the circumstances of their formation and what they perceived as revolutionary spirit. In the first weeks, Japanese troops often withdrew from urban areas to avoid confrontations.|$|E

40|$|Based on socio-emotional {{selectivity}} and self-categorization theories, {{we developed}} and tested a model {{on how the}} interplay between employee age and <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> generativity and development predicts age bias and turnover intentions via intergenerational contact quality in the workplace. We hypothesized indirect effects <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> generativity on outcomes through intergenerational contact quality among older workers only, whereas we expected that the indirect effects <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> development are stronger for young compared to older workers. Data came from 321 employees in Belgium who responded to an online questionnaire. Results showed that age moderated the relationships <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> generativity and development with intergenerational contact quality consistent with the expected patterns. Furthermore, age moderated the indirect effects <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> generativity and development on age bias through intergenerational contact quality, but not on turnover intentions. Implications for future research and practical suggestions for managing intergenerational contact at work are discussed...|$|R

The chairman of the Science Definition Team stated that NASA does not presume that life ever existed on Mars, but given the recent Curiosity rover findings, past Martian life seems possible.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Louisville {{returned}} to growth, {{with an increase}} in manufacturing, establishment of new factories, and transporting goods by train. The new industrial jobs attracted both black rural workers, including freedmen from the South, and foreign immigrants. It was a city <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> them. Ex-Confederate officers entered law, insurance, real estate and political offices, largely taking control of the city. This led to the jibe that Louisville joined the Confederacy after the war was over.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{polarization}} {{of the debate}} over constitution from 1970 to 1995, conservative voters often limited their choice between the Quebec Liberal Party or the Parti Québécois. However, a number of commentators claim that resentment of the rest of Quebec against Montreal’s perceived hegemony, general mistrust towards current office holders, taxpayers' frustration and constitutional fatigue let a cultural gap in Quebec society become more apparent and provided a window <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> the ADQ to grow.|$|E

25|$|During the Iran–Iraq War, Khuzestan was {{the focus}} of the Iraqi {{invasion}} of Iran, leading to the flight of thousands of the province's residents. As a result, Khuzestan suffered the heaviest damage of all Iranian provinces during the war. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein felt confident that the Arab population of the Khuzestan would react enthusiastically to the prospect of union with Iraq. However, resistance to the invasion was fierce, stalling the Iraqi military's advance, and ultimately opening a window <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> an Iranian counter-offensive.|$|E
25|$|A {{review of}} European and American {{research}} indicates that terrorist bombings cause Islamophobia and hate crimes to flare up but, in calmer times, they subside again, although to a relatively high level. Terrorist's most persuasive message is that of fear and fear, a primary and strong emotion, increases risk estimates and has distortive effects on the perception of ordinary Muslims. Widespread Islamophobic prejudice seems to contribute to anti-Muslim hate crimes, but indirectly: terrorist attacks and intensified Islamophobic prejudice serve as a window <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> extremist groups and networks.|$|E
25|$|Hijli {{railway station}} {{as a result}} of this wall. The local {{community}} opposed the construction of a flyover from the railway station to the campus formerly, under the pretext that it would lead to substantial losses <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> the shops along the roads. After the flyover construction had been completed and became operational, things ensued in a manner as the local community had anticipated, but the flyover has resulted in more convenience for transport. The construction of the 1052.69m long flyover was approved by the Indian Railways and West Bengal state government. It's called Hijli Road overbridge, and was constructed for estimated cost of Rs.237million ($5.3million).|$|E

25|$|Agriculture and {{forestry}} {{is an area}} <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> the country. “Angola requires 4.5 {{million tonnes}} a year of grain but grows only about 55% of the corn it needs, 20% of the rice and just 5% of its required wheat”(African economic Outlook) but “less than 3 percent of Angola's abundant fertile land is cultivated and the economic potential of the forestry sector remains largely unexploited” (World Bank). From this fact we can appreciate the capacity that Angola has to increase production for {{not only for the}} national market but also the international one. Investing in this sector can help reduce unemployment and more specifically in the rural areas. This will undoubtedly have consequences on the living standard of rural civilians.|$|E

Lee highlighted {{the successes of}} the PAP government since the last election, especially in creating jobs, reducing unemployment, retraining workers, and investing in young people. He argued that the strategies were working and economy was striving, and that PAP had united the people under the threat of terrorism. He reminded viewers that Singapore would have great opportunities as well as major challenges ahead as Asia was rising, and the PAP would make Singapore a land <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> all people, and each person could find {{his or her own}} niche and excel. He said that the government would educate each Singaporean to be the best they can be.|$|E
25|$|The {{demise of}} Maximilien Robespierre in 1795 {{provided}} a brief window <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> French Royalists {{at home and}} abroad. For example, those {{who had participated in}} the Vendée uprising were able to communicate with their supporters in Great Britain. These rebels, in collaboration with their British allies, attempted to take a port on the French coast. However, this attempt was unsuccessful, resulting in the execution of 748 royalist officers, an event that became known as the Quiberon disaster. As the Republic evolved into the French Directory, fears that émigrés with royalist leanings would return prompted harsher legislation against them, including the Law of Hostages passed in 1799. This legislation considered relatives of émigrés as hostages and ordered them to surrender within ten days or to be treated as émigrés themselves.|$|E

25|$|Membership in the CRP once {{consisted}} of the four municipal districts and two additional towns. These included the MD of Bighorn No. 8, the MD of Foothills No. 31, Rocky View County, Wheatland County and the towns of Crossfield and High River. The MD of Bighorn No. 8 {{pulled out of the}} CRP in March 2009 due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> infrastructure connectivity to the balance of the Calgary Region. In June 2009, the latter three opposed the Calgary Metropolitan Plan that was being considered for approval by the CRP's member municipalities. All three subsequently withdrew from the CRP in September 2009. Crossfield and High River withdrew from the CRP in December 2011 and April 2013 respectively citing concerns that the CRP was becoming another layer of government.|$|E
25|$|As {{the race}} {{continued}} to Pennsylvania, Indiana, and North Carolina, many observers concluded that Clinton had little chance to overcome Obama's lead in pledged delegates. Even {{if she were}} to succeed in changing the dynamics of the race, there would not be enough pledged delegates remaining for her to catch up under most realistic scenarios. Some analysts believed Clinton could still win the nomination by raising doubts about Obama's electability, fighting for Michigan and Florida delegates to be seated at the convention, and convincing superdelegates to support her despite her expected loss in the pledged delegate vote. However, the window <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> re-votes in Michigan and Florida appeared to close in late March, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention, said that it would be harmful to the party if superdelegates were to overturn the result of the pledged delegate vote.|$|E
25|$|The 1860s were a time <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> Woodland. The {{county seat}} was {{permanently}} moved to Woodland after Washington, California (now {{a part of}} West Sacramento) had flooded. Schools, homes, churches, and a cemetery were built at this time. The town's newspaper, the Daily Democrat, and a post office were established, and a rail line was built. In 1869, the California Pacific Railroad Company constructed a line between Davisville (now Davis) and Marysville with a Woodland station {{in the area of}} College Street and Lincoln Avenue. The rail line expanded and was eventually acquired by Southern Pacific Railroad. The track was then relocated from College Street to East Street, {{the eastern edge of the}} city at that point. The addition of the railroad is what led to the expansion of Woodland as a town. Before the railroad came, people were building primarily on Main Street and northward. Later, expansion headed westward and southward, as well.|$|E
