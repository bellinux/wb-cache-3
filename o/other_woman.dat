5|$|In Kansas City, Kansas, two {{religious}} missionaries visit {{two women}} at two different {{homes in the}} same neighborhood who look exactly alike. The second woman yells at them to go away and the two men, inexplicably, get into a fight in the second woman's front yard. Later, two FBI agents who look and sound remarkably similar to Mulder and Scully visit the first woman, Betty Templeton (Kathy Griffin). Betty claims to have never seen the <b>other</b> <b>woman</b> before. The <b>other</b> <b>woman</b> then passes her by in a car and the two agents begin fighting each other, much like the missionaries. They are severely injured after the gruesome mauling. Both agents, who had worked together for seven years, said that they were possessed. Meanwhile, the <b>other</b> <b>woman,</b> Lulu Pfeiffer (also Kathy Griffin), applies for a job at Koko's Copies, but does not get it because she has had 17 jobs in 17 states {{in the past three years}} and moves around too much. She becomes aggravated and suddenly, all the copies become black. The <b>other</b> <b>woman,</b> Betty, goes to another job with the same name and same resume.|$|E

5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage {{and looks up at}} it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects her like a mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. She closes her eyes, plunges her hands into the body and pulls out a sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown how the <b>other</b> <b>woman</b> was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E

40|$|Adult female {{survivors}} of incest (n= 68) {{were compared to}} <b>other</b> <b>women</b> (n= 93) {{with respect to their}} relationships with their mothers and female friends. For the most part, incest survivors did not differ from <b>other</b> <b>women</b> in terms of their friendship networks or the quality of their closest female friendships. However, they did report lower levels of interpersonal competence. Survivors described relatively poor relationships with their mothers, who were seen by them as socially isolated and lonely. Measures of relationships with their friends were largely independent of those assessing relationships with their mothers. These results imply that incest indeed affects the relationships adult survivors share with <b>other</b> <b>women,</b> particularly their mothers, but also indicate that negative consequences are not always present. Many aspects of friendships with <b>other</b> <b>women</b> seem resilient and may serve as a positive foundation for therapeutic interventions...|$|R
