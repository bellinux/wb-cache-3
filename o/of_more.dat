Crosby Hall, which was part <b>of</b> <b>More's</b> London residence, was {{eventually}} relocated and reconstructed in Chelsea by conservation architect Walter Godfrey in 1910.

Crosby Hall is privately owned and closed to the public. The modern structures face the Thames and include an entry way that displays More's arms, heraldic beasts, and a Latin maxim.
