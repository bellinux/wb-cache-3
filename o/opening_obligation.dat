40|$|This article calls {{attention}} to a neglected copy of the sermon for the feast of St Mary Magdalene from John Mirk's late-fourteenth-century Middle English sermon collection, the Festial. The copy, contained in London, British Library, MS Cotton Titus A. XXVI, was co"ectly identified in 1970, but since then has been ignored by Festial scholars and not recognized by those writing on saints' lives. The discussion of the early-sixteenth-century manuscript places the sermon {{in the context of}} the religious and secular works copied with it, and suggests that the compilation may have been made for private or household purposes by a non-professional book producer. Textual analysis reveals the sermon to be distinctive: like some other later versions of Mirk's original, it removes the <b>opening</b> <b>obligation</b> to attend church, but retains the invocation to a plural audience. But the text has also been comprehensively and independently rewritten, with the intention of bringing it up to date in terms of lexis, syntax, and idiom, as is demonstrated by comparison with manuscripts variously representing an early form if the text and other rewritings of Mirk's original...|$|E
40|$|A theory-based {{evaluation}} of an in-progress {{program for the}} development of new youth centers the South of Italy is presented in this article. The study investigated if and to what extent the program was working to increase youth participation. Data were collected through document analysis of the program, in-depth interviews and a survey with the managers of the youth centers. Consistent with some previous study, results suggested that some program mechanisms related to cultural <b>openings,</b> <b>obligations</b> and opportunities of participation had been effective in the activation of youth participation. Some contextual factors behind such mechanisms were also taken into account. Then, the study confirmed the need to further develop forms of youth work able to mediate between the regulatory pressures expressed by public institutions and the claims of autonomy and participation manifested by youth...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} competition and investments in the telecommunications industries of OECD countries. The impact of market opening on infrastructure investments is a critical ingredient for regulatory reviews, but the literature findings on this subject are quite mixed. The paper employs various methods {{to find out whether}} pro-entry regulation and competition had any significant effect. As a first investigation, we seek unknown breakpoints in countries׳ investment series. Market <b>opening</b> and unbundling <b>obligations</b> are found to be temporally associated with investment breaks only in some countries, and both upward and downward shifts are detected. In order to understand causes behind cross-country heterogeneity, a micro-econometric model of incumbent׳s investments is estimated. Neither unbundling obligations nor competition intensity, alone, have a significant effect, but they spur incumbent׳s investments in combination. Overall, our results support the view that competition does not depress investments at firm and country levels. Conditionally on their ability to foster competition, unbundling obligations play a positive role...|$|R
