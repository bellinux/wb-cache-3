Chloride of antimony (a compound of one proportional of antimony and {{one and a half}} of chlorine) of recent preparation was put into a tube (fig. 68.) (789.), and submitted when fused to the action of the current, the positive electrode being of plumbago. No electricity passed, and no appearance of decomposition was visible at first; but when the positive and negative electrodes were brought very near each other in the chloride, then a feeble action occurred and a feeble current passed. The effect altogether was so small (although quite amenable to the law before given (394.)), and so unlike the decomposition and conduction occurring in all the other cases, that I attribute it to the presence of a minute quantity of water, (for which this and many <b>other</b> <b>chlorides</b> have strong attractions, producing hydrated chlorides,) or perhaps of a true protochloride consisting of single proportionals (695, 796.).|$|E

60|$|The {{waters of}} the Dead Sea are thus in the {{condition}} of having already deposited almost all their gypsum, {{as well as the}} greater part of the salt they originally contained. They are, in fact, much like sea water which has been boiled down till it has reached the state of a thick salty liquid; and though most of the salt is now already deposited in a deep layer on the bottom, enough still remains in solution to make the Dead Sea infinitely salter than the general ocean. At the same time, there are a good many other things in solution in sea water besides gypsum and common salt; such as chloride of magnesia sulphate of potassium, and other interesting substances with pretty chemical names, well calculated to endear them at first sight to the sentimental affections of the general public. These other by-contents of the water are often still longer in getting deposited than common salt; and, owing to their intermixture in a very concentrated form with the mother liquid of the Dead Sea, the water of that evaporating lake is not only salt but also slimy and fetid to the last degree, its taste being accurately described as half brine, half rancid oil. Indeed, the salt has been so far precipitated already that there is now five times as much chloride of magnesium left in the water as there is common salt. By the way, it is a lucky thing for us that these various soluble minerals are of such constitution as to be thrown down separately at different stages of concentration in the evaporating liquid; for, if it were otherwise, they would all get deposited together, and we should find on all old salt lake beds only a mixed layer of gypsum, salt, and <b>other</b> <b>chlorides</b> and sulphates, absolutely useless for any practical human purpose. In that case, we should be entirely dependent upon marine salt pans and artificial processes for our entire salt supply. As it is, we find the materials deposited one above another in regular layers; first, the gypsum at the bottom; then the rock-salt; and last of all, on top, the more soluble mineral constituents.|$|E

Meanwhile, much wastewater containing high concentration of chlorides generated during the wet process if the liquid-solid weight ratio was not appropriate. So measures were taken to control the dissolving amounts of calcium chlorides which contribute to the further reuse as basis with cement kiln and remove more chlorides like sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl) and so on which produce negative impact. In laboratory experiments, the water-washing process was applied to study the typical MSWI fly ash and investigate the optimal parameters. First, multi-step water-washing process was carried out and key parameters influencing the removal rate of chlorides were determined. Then, cyclic water-washing process was conducted to overcome defects {{on the basis of the}} former.

When compared with the original fly ash, calcium chlorides remained in the treated fly ash won’t be a huge loss while <b>other</b> <b>chlorides</b> are greatly reduced.

30|$|Titanium dioxide is {{the most}} widely used white pigment because of its {{brightness}} and very high refractive index, in which it is surpassed only by a few other materials. TiO 2 is unique because it efficiently scatters visible light, thereby imparting whiteness, brightness, and opacity when incorporated into a coating. Dry compacted TiO 2 samples are characterized by their brightness and whiteness and exhibit reflectance properties approaching that of the perfect reflecting diffuser. ‘Color’ is carefully controlled during the TiO 2 manufacturing process through the removal of the trace amounts of metal oxide contaminants. These light-absorbing contaminants will detract from the brightness and whiteness of the pigment and can affect the appearance of white and near-white paints containing that pigment. The opacity of white pigments mainly derives from the scattering, while the opacity of black pigments is a result of absorption ability[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. It was observed that if the TiO 2 is produced in a commercial production plant on particular days when there is oil leak in the larox filter, the color and brightness of the produced pigment failed when measured the same in acrylic lacquer paint (vehicle b). Also, this failure is not seen when the color and brightness are measured in dry mode (dry b). These observations were not a single case but were seen occasionally in the quality analysis. The failure in the vehicle color, once commenced, was seen continued consecutively with three to four final products. The sources of oil contamination during the manufacturing process can be as follows: In the chloride process of manufacturing TiO 2, rutile or high-grade ilmenite is converted to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4) gas. The conversion takes place in a chlorinator (i.e., fluidized bed reactor) in the presence of chlorine gas at 850 °C to 950 °C, with petroleum coke added as a reductant. The chief reaction products are volatile metal chlorides, including TiCl 4, which are collected. The nonvolatile chlorides and the unreacted solids that remain in the chlorinator are wasted, forming the special waste stream ‘chloride process waste solids’. The gaseous raw product stream is purified to separate the titanium tetrachloride from <b>other</b> <b>chlorides.</b> Separation is by fractional condensation, double distillation, and chemical treatment. Ferric chloride (FeCl 3) is removed as a major acidic liquid waste stream through fractional condensation. Additional trace metal chlorides are removed through double distillation. Finally, vanadium oxychloride (VOCl 3), which has a boiling point close to that of TiCl 4 (136 °C), is removed as a low-volume non-special waste by complexing with mineral oil and reduced with hydrogen sulfide to VOCl 2 or by complexing with copper. The purified TiCl 4 is then oxidized to TiO 2 at 985 °C, driving off chlorine gas, which is recycled to the chlorinator. Aluminum chloride is added in the oxidation step to promote formation of the rutile crystal which is the TiO 2 product. The next stage of TiO 2 manufacturing is surface treatment, where the TiO 2 from oxidizer is converted to slurry in water, which is then subjected to sand milling to the required particle size. The clarified slurry from the sand mill is treated with alumina or zirconia for coating the surface of bare titanium dioxide with amorphous aluminum or zirconium oxide. The surface-treated product is then filtered through larox by pressing and followed by organic treatment and spin flash drying. Finally, the dried product is subjected to micronization process to get the surface-treated product. The brightness and color of this product is important for its marketing.|$|E
