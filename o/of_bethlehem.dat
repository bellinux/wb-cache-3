5|$|In 1187, Saladin, the Sultan of Egypt and Syria {{who led the}} Muslim Ayyubids, {{captured}} Bethlehem {{from the}} Crusaders. The Latin clerics were forced to leave, allowing the Greek Orthodox clergy to return. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, Bethlehem suffered {{from the loss of}} the pilgrim trade, as there was a sharp decrease of European pilgrims. William IV, Count of Nevers had promised the Christian bishops <b>of</b> <b>Bethlehem</b> that if Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control, he would welcome them {{in the small town of}} Clamecy in present-day Burgundy, France. As a result, the Bishop <b>of</b> <b>Bethlehem</b> duly took up residence in the hospital of Panthenor, Clamecy, in 1223.

5|$|Bethlehem celebrates festivals {{related to}} saints and prophets {{associated}} with Palestinian folklore. One such festival is the annual Feast of Saint George (al-Khadr) on 5–6 May. During the celebrations, Greek Orthodox Christians {{from the city}} march in procession to {{the nearby town of}} al-Khader to baptize newborns in the waters around the Monastery of St. George and sacrifice a sheep in ritual. The Feast of St. Elijah is commemorated by a procession to Mar Elias, a Greek Orthodox monastery north <b>of</b> <b>Bethlehem.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bethlehem {{now has a}} Muslim majority, but {{is still}} home to a {{significant}} Palestinian Christian community. Bethlehem's chief economic sector is tourism, which peaks during the Christmas season when Christians make pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, as they have done for almost 2,000 years. Bethlehem has over 30 hotels and 300 handicraft workshops. Rachel's Tomb, an important Jewish holy site, {{is located at the}} northern entrance <b>of</b> <b>Bethlehem.</b>|$|E
5|$|If {{the story}} of the Star <b>of</b> <b>Bethlehem</b> {{described}} an actual event, it might identify the year Jesus was born. The Gospel of Matthew describes the birth of Jesus as taking place when Herod was king. According to Josephus, Herod died after a lunar eclipse and before a Passover Feast. The eclipse is usually identified as the eclipse of March 13, 4 BC. Other scholars suggested dates in 5 BC, because it allows seven months for the events Josephus documented between the lunar eclipse and the Passover than the 29 days allowed by lunar eclipse in 4 BC. Others suggest it was an eclipse in 1 BC. The narrative implies that Jesus was born sometime between the first appearance of the star and the appearance of the Magi at Herod's court. That the king is said to have ordered the execution of boys two years of age and younger implies that the Star <b>of</b> <b>Bethlehem</b> appeared within the preceding two years. Some scholars date the birth of Jesus as 6–4 BC, while others suggest Jesus' birth was in 3/2 BC.|$|E

5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{who see the}} gospel nativity stories as later apologetic accounts created to establish the Messianic status of Jesus regard the Star <b>of</b> <b>Bethlehem</b> as a pious fiction. Aspects of Matthew's account which have raised questions of the historical event include: Matthew {{is the only one}} of the four gospels which mentions either the Star <b>of</b> <b>Bethlehem</b> or the Magi. In Mark 6:1-4, the author of the Gospel of Mark, considered by modern text scholars to be the oldest of the Gospels, does not appear to be aware of the Bethlehem nativity story.. Scholars suggest that Jesus was born in Nazareth and that the Bethlehem nativity narratives reflect a desire by the Gospel writers to present his birth as the fulfillment of prophecy. The Matthew account conflicts with that given in the Gospel of Luke, in which the family of Jesus already live in Nazareth, travel to Bethlehem for the census, and return home almost immediately.|$|E
