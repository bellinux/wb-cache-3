25|$|Fluoride {{in various}} forms {{is the most popular}} active {{ingredient}} in toothpaste to prevent cavities. Fluoride occurs in small amounts in plants, animals, and some natural water sources. The additional fluoride in toothpaste has beneficial effects on the formation of dental enamel and bones. Sodium fluoride (NaF) is the most common source of fluoride, but stannous fluoride (SnF2), <b>olaflur</b> (an organic salt of fluoride), and sodium monofluorophosphate (Na2PO3F) are also used. Stannous fluoride {{has been shown to be}} more effective than sodium fluoride in reducing the incidence of dental caries and controlling gingivitis, but causes somewhat more surface stains.|$|E
50|$|Overdosage {{leads to}} {{irritation}} {{of the oral}} mucosa. In especially sensitive persons, even standard doses of <b>olaflur</b> can cause irritation. Like other fluoride salts, <b>olaflur</b> is toxic when given in high doses {{over an extended period}} of time. Especially in children, before the development of the permanent teeth, overdosage can lead to dental fluorosis, a discolouring and weakening of the enamel. In acute cases of overdosage, for example when an <b>olaflur</b> containing preparation is swallowed, calcium in any oral form serves as an antidote. Often milk is used because it is usually at hand.|$|E
50|$|Because calcium {{fluoride}} is practically insoluble in water, calcium-containing drugs and food inhibit {{the action of}} <b>olaflur.</b>|$|E

50|$|Dectaflur (INN) is a fluoride-containing {{substance}} {{used for}} the prevention and treatment of dental caries, sensitive teeth, and the refluoridation of damaged tooth enamel, typically in combination with <b>olaflur.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>olaflur</b> starts from cattle's tallow. The contained fatty acids, mainly stearic acid (C17H35COOH), are obtained by hydrolysis, and then converted to the corresponding amides, {{which in turn}} are reduced catalytically to the primary amines (largely octadecylamine). Addition of acrylonitrile, followed by another reduction, yields N-alkyl-1,3-propanediamines. The two nitrogen atoms react with ethylene oxide to form tertiary amines. Finally, hydrofluoric acid is added to give the end product. Because <b>olaflur</b> is produced from a mixture of fatty acids, some molecules have side chains that are longer or shorter than 18 carbon atoms. Other byproducts of the reaction include hydroxyethyl ethers resulting from addition of ethylene oxide to the free hydroxyl groups. The presence of these side products is clinically irrelevant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Olaflur</b> (INN, or amine {{fluoride}} 297) is a fluoride-containing {{substance that}} is an ingredient of toothpastes and solutions {{for the prevention of}} dental caries. It has been in use since 1966. Especially in combination with dectaflur, it is also used in the form of gels for the treatment of early stages of caries, sensitive teeth, and by dentists for the refluoridation of damaged tooth enamel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Olaflur</b> is a salt {{consisting}} of an alkyl ammonium cation and fluoride as the counterion. With a long lipophilic hydrocarbon chain, the cation has surfactant properties. It forms a film layer {{on the surface}} of teeth, which facilitates incorporation of fluoride into the enamel. The top layers of the enamel's primary mineral, hydroxylapatite, are converted into the more robust fluorapatite. The fluoridation reaches only a depth of a few nanometres, which has raised doubts whether the mechanism really relies on the formation of fluorapatite.|$|E

GABA is wholly owned by Colgate-Palmolive company of the United States.Elmex was the first toothpaste to contain the organic Amine Fluoride (AmF) <b>olaflur</b> as an active ingredient for protection against dental caries. Elmex is often sold together with Aronal which {{should be used in}} the morning. Aronal contains vitamin A to protect the gums against inflammation.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Acidic pH {{and high}} {{fluoride}} (F) concentration impair the corrosion resistance of titanium (Ti). Caries-preventive products contain high amounts of F and are applied at low pH. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate whether fluoride applied in different forms has different short-, mid-, and long-term effects on the growth of the bacteria Streptococcus mutans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ti discs with polished surface were treated with a rinse containing 0. 025 % <b>olaflur,</b> a gel containing 1. 25 % <b>olaflur,</b> or a 1 % aqueous solution of NaF (pH 4. 5), and they were incubated with S mutans for 21 days. Control discs did not get prophylactic treatment. Protein assay analysis was performed at regular intervals to estimate the amount of S mutans. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were also taken. RESULTS: Bacterial protein quantity became significantly different only by the 21 st day. Fluoride in rinse and gel proved to be superior to NaF in aqueous solution or no treatment (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05, respectively). However, the discs treated with fluoride in gel showed signs of corrosion in SEM images. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the use of fluoride-containing mouthwashes might be the best and safest oral hygienic choice for patients with oral implants. Furthermore, <b>olaflur</b> seems to be superior to NaF for long-term use at low pH...|$|E
40|$|Enolase and ATPase are {{sensitive}} to fluoride. It is unclear whether this sensitivity differs for F-sensitive and F-resistant cells or for different types of fluoride. Permeabilized cells of the fluoride-sensitive strain Streptococcus mutans C 180 - 2 and its fluoride-resistant mutant strain C 180 - 2 FR were preincubated at pH 7 or 4 with NaF, the amine fluorides <b>Olaflur</b> and Dectaflur and amine chloride controls. After preincubations, enolase and ATPase activities of the cells were assessed. Enolase activity was more inhibited after preincubation at pH 7 with NaF than with <b>Olaflur.</b> Amine chloride stimulated, although not with statistical significance, the enolase activity of both strains. After preincubation at pH 4 the enolases were strongly inactivated, but the fluoride-resistant strain's enolase to a lesser extent. The results suggested that amine acts to protect enolase activity against the detrimental low pH effect. Gene sequencing showed that the enolase genes of the fluoride-resistant and fluoride-sensitive strain were identical. ATPase activity was not reduced after NaF preincubation at either pH 7 or pH 4. The amine fluorides and their chloride controls in the preincubation mixture reduced the ATPase activity significantly at both pH values. In conclusion, our results showed that preincubation with amine fluoride did not inhibit enolase activity more effectively than NaF. The amine part of the molecule may protect enolase activity against preincubations at low pH. ATPase activity was not inhibited by NaF preincubation but was significantly inhibited after preincubation with amine fluorides and amine chlorides...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTOF-SIMS mass {{spectroscopy}} data are presented on ion irradiation of hard dental tissue using {{a beam of}} Xe- 129 (20 +) (15 kV) ions delivered in the ARIBE facility by an ECR source. The investigation {{was focused on the}} mass distribution of the fragment ions. A comparison is made between the mass spectra from hard dental tissue treated by olaflur-(C 27 H 60 F 2 N 2 O 3) and untreated hard dental tissue obtained under irradiation by low-energy highly-charged ions (HCIs). We found significant differences between the mass spectra of enamel after introducing amine fluoride (<b>olaflur)</b> and the mass spectra of pure untreated enamel. Further, we separated out the effects caused by radiation induced in the tooth enamel from those induced in dentin, which has not been performed before. In order to conduct a further detailed analysis, it is necessary to extend the research scope to include the influence of fluorine compounds on enamel and dentin...|$|E
