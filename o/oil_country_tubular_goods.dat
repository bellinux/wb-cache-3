40|$|Purpose: Alloying {{elements}} in steels {{are used for}} a various reasons. One {{of the most important}} is the achievement of higher strength in required shapes and sizes. Often in very large sections of steels are used for production of the <b>oil</b> <b>country</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>goods</b> (OCTG). Therefore the hardenability of steels is an important property aim for the appropriate concentration of alloying elements needed to harden the section of steel for oil industry. In this study the hardenability, the cooling rates and microstructures of low alloy Cr-Mo and Mn-Mo steels were investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The cooling rate determines the amount of martensite structure. Hardenability test was carried out by Jominy method. During Jominy testing the temperature changes were monitored by means of CrNi-Ni thermocouples which are connected to eight-channel digital/analogues converter. Microstructure was determined using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Findings: The cooling rates in the temperature range between 1133 and 973 K at different distances from the quenched end of low alloy Cr-Mo and Mn-Mo steels were found. Also the hardness and microstructures against the distances from quenched end are determined. Research limitations/implications: It is known that carbon has a marked the effect on hardenability of steel, but its use at higher levels is limited because lower toughness and increased probability of distortion and cracking during heat treatment and welding. Addition of manganese at low alloy steels is very useful for improvement of their hardenability. Practical implications: Chemical composition of low alloy steels for oil industry is usually complex and defined in most cases by standard which give range of concentration of the important alloying elements (Cr, Mo, Mn, etc.) as well as the upper limits of impurity elements (S and P). Alloying {{elements in}}crease the cost of the steel and from these reason it is important to select only steels which required to ensure compliance with specifications. The economical way of increasing the hardenability of steels (at constant carbon content) is to increase the manganese content. Originality/value: Originality and high value of our research work based on development and application of a new grade of low alloy Mn-Mo steel for <b>oil</b> <b>country</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>goods...</b>|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand for oil and gas, coupled {{with the fact that}} oil reserves are becoming rather scarce, the petroleum industry is pushed to drill and complete deeper wells. Threaded connections are often the weakest link in this process and are therefore the subject of research and optimization. At first, this paper presents a brief overview of the design characteristics of today’s premium connections. Secondly, the failure mechanisms of <b>Oil</b> <b>Country</b> <b>Tubular</b> <b>Goods</b> (OCTG) are discussed. At last, an in-depth analysis of the API 5 C 3 formulae is given. Four formulas for collapse are given in API 5 C 3, each valid for a specific D/t range. With increasing yield strength of the steel, the difference between the yield strength collapse and the plastic collapse gets larger. Also, the elastic collapse zone gets bigger, so stronger materials with relatively large D/t ratios will collapse in the elastic zone instead of the plastic or transition zone. These four formulas can be approached by a third-order polynomial equation that is valid for all D/t ratios...|$|E

Tough competition between manufacturers gives them plenty of incentive to make their processes in raw material and energy usage more and more efficient. In this context the expansion process {{is one of the}} critical production steps in the manufacturing of seamless stainless steel pipes. This work presents a sensitivity analysis of a finite element method (FEM) for the simulation of the expansion of the alloy UNS N 08028. The input parameters ram speed, tool angle, initial ID and final ID of the billet as well as temperature were used to describe responses like tool wear and material loss. With the aim to minimize the tool wear and to reduce the material waste, a study of influence of the input parameters on the mentioned responses were performed. This development is supported by experimental work in order to validate the simulation model. The sector demand for new materials with specific properties and the cost-intensive experimental trials justifies the use of such simulation tools and opens great opportunities for the industry...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} WTO Appellate Body Report on United States-Anti-Dumping Measures on <b>Oil</b> <b>Country</b> <b>Tubular</b> <b>Goods</b> (OCTG) from Mexico (WT/DS 282 /AB/R 2 November 2005). This dispute {{concerns}} the disciplines {{imposed by the}} Anti-Dumping Agreement on WTO Members seeking to extend their anti-dumping measures beyond the original five-year period through a so-called sunset review. Our analysis focuses on the Appellate Body's finding {{in this case that}} no causation analysis is required in sunset reviews, and addresses the AB's approach towards the legal instrument that provides for the US policy in terms of sunset reviews, the Sunset Policy Bulletin. We conclude that the Anti-Dumping Agreement, as interpreted by the Appellate Body in this and other similar cases, imposes only minimal disciplines of a general nature on Members wishing to extend the anti-dumping measure beyond its original five-year period. We argue that the ‘textual' argument relied on to support this deferential approach is weak and has resulted in undermining the practical effect of, what was considered to be, one of the major achievements of the Uruguay Round Anti-Dumping Agreement: limiting the life span of an anti-dumping measure to five years. From an economic perspective, Panels and the Appellate Body are simply debating the wrong type of questions. The prospective nature required by a sunset review analysis raises questions such as why exporters engaged in dumping in the first place, and what the conditions of the industry were so that the dumped imports caused injury. At the moment, sunset reviews seem adrift as panels and the Appellate Body fail to give guidance to Members on how to do a more economically sound and informed revie...|$|E
40|$|The modern {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} of America has seen most of the high quality, easily obtainable resources, already produced, thus causing wells to be drilled deeper in search for unconventional resources. This means <b>Oil</b> <b>Country</b> <b>Tubular</b> <b>Goods</b> (OCTG) must improve in order to withstand harsher conditions; especially the ability of connections to effectively create leak tight seals. This study investigates the use of thread connections in tight gas fields; therefore, an insight into their potential to contribute to fulfilling the energy demands is necessary. Also, a survey of completed projects done in tight gas fields can provide vital information that will establish the minimum requirements thread connection must meet to perform its functions. To make suitable adjustments to ensure safe and efficient operations we must thoroughly understand the many aspects of thread connections. To have this understanding, a review of previous works was carried out that highlights the capabilities and imitations of thread connections. In addition to reviewing previous work done on thread connections; this study measured the viscosity of thread compounds under variable conditions. It was found that viscosity of thread compound falls in the range of 285, 667 cP and 47, 758 cP when measured between 32. 9 degrees F and 121. 5 degrees F. This can be very important because thread compound is essential to the function of thread connections. The knowledge of its viscosity can help choose the most suitable compound. By knowing the value of the viscosity of a thread compound it {{can also be used to}} form an analytical assessment of the grooved plate method by providing a means to calculate a pressure gradient which impacts the leakage...|$|E
