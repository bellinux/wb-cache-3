For four hours his concentration never wavered...he stroked the ball through {{the cover and}} mid-wicket gaps in the field. Shooters became more frequent, but Colin dug them <b>out.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> joined him at the wicket he was a run short of his maiden Test century: a goal he achieved with a scampered single.

500|$|After {{revealing}} their deception to a busy Queen Victoria public house, Peggy slapped both Pat and Frank, rebuffed Frank's {{attempt at}} reconciliation {{and left him}} to depart alone. In December 2000, Ian Hyland of the Sunday Mirror voted the scene in which Peggy slaps both Pat and Frank {{as one of the}} [...] "TV fights of the year", saying [...] "It was Peggy's speech which really made it a Bonfire Night to remember. But the slaps were equally well dispatched." [...] Commenting on Reid's exit, Windsor has said, [...] "We fell <b>out</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found out he was leaving because it was a shock for me. I was really upset. I've known him 30 odd years and I really like working with him. We had a great relationship as friends as well as performers. I got my own back when I had to slap him after I found out he was fooling around with Pat. I did the slap twice as I didn't think I did it hard enough the first time." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{an ensemble}} {{of family and}} friends of Gwen and Rhys previously unseen in the series. William Thomas and Sharon Morgan were cast as Gwen's parents Geraint and Mary Cooper. Davies re-introduced the characters during the fourth series of the show, considering Thomas and Morgan to be [...] "two fine Welsh actors". Thomas had previously appeared as two different characters in the 1988 Doctor Who serial Remembrance of the Daleks and the 2005 Doctor Who episode [...] "Boom Town". Upon appearing in [...] "Something Borrowed" [...] he became the first actor to have appeared in all three of the classic series, new series and Torchwood. Nerys Hughes played Rhys' mother Brenda Williams, in addition to a duplicate form of the alien Nostrovite. Like Thomas she had previously appeared in a Doctor Who serial (the 1982 story Kinda). Hughes enjoyed getting to play a [...] "monster" [...] {{for the first time in}} her career which involved having [...] "fangs and claws and red eyes" [...] and being wired up so [...] "all this black blood can ooze <b>out</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> get shot". Despite the funny aspect of the script Hughes took the role seriously stating that [...] "everyone plays it for real" [...] and that [...] "you can't camp it up". She believed that as an actor [...] "you've got to believe what you're doing".|$|E
500|$|... "I Luv This Shit" [...] {{was written}} by August Alsina, The Exclusives (Sean McMillion and Ralph Jeanty), Samuel Irving III, Christine Massa, and Trinidad James and was {{produced}} by Knucklehead. It was recorded by McMillion and Cody Sciara at Goldie's Playhouse and Zac Recording Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and mixed by Jaycen Joshua with assistance from Trehy Harris at Larrabee Sound Studios, North Hollywood. Vocals were produced by The Exclusives. Knucklehead told Vibe in 2014 that he created the song's beat and {{knew it would be}} successful, stating: [...] "I just knew what [...] voice was gonna do over my beat. And that beat didn't sound like thing else at the time that was <b>out</b> ... <b>When</b> <b>I</b> made the beat, I called him immediately after I finished it." [...] After playing the beat to Alsina and The Exclusives, they recorded the song in one hour. It is an R song instrumented by guitar, synthesizer, synth-horns and a heavy bassline. The production was compared by Spin Brandon Soderberg to the work of The-Dream. It revolves around about partying with alcohol and drugs with the central hook [...] "I love this shit", and references the vodka Ciroc, yet {{there is an element of}} sorrow to Alsina's vocals. James' verse contemplates human nature, according to Gregory Adams of Exclaim!. [...] "I Luv This Shit" [...] was originally recorded for Alsina's mixtape The Product 2 (2013), and was included on his debut EP [...] (2013). It was also a bonus track on his first studio album, Testimony (2014).|$|E

2500|$|In The Other Hollywood, Boreman {{said she}} felt [...] "used" [...] by the anti-pornography movement. [...] "Between Andrea Dworkin and Kitty MacKinnon, they've written so many books, and they mention my name and all that, but financially they've never helped me <b>out.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> showed up with them for {{speaking}} engagements, I'd always get five hundred dollars or so. But I know they made a few bucks off me, just like everybody else." [...] Thus Tom Leonard, writing for the London Daily Mail on March 26, 2012, alleged that both the porn industry and the anti-pornography movement had taken advantage of her.|$|E
2500|$|Heseltine {{was brought}} up in {{relative}} luxury at No. 1, Uplands Crescent (now No. 5). Heseltine told Tatler interviewer Charlotte Edwardes in 2016: [...] "At prep school, I started a birdwatching club called the Tit Club. Every member was named after a member of the tit family: the Marsh Tit, the Blue Tit. I was the Great Tit". He once feared the story might reach the press: [...] "I just know if that had got <b>out</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was in active politics, I would never have recovered". He enjoyed angling in Brynmill Park and won a junior competition. He was educated at Shrewsbury School.|$|E

2500|$|E: Yes, I {{did not do}} it consciously. I saw all the sunset, but I didn't see {{the fence}} and large boulder that were there. I blocked out {{everything}} except the sunset. After I saw the sunset, I lost consciousness for three days. When I finally awakened, I asked my father why they had taken out that fence, tree, and boulder. I did not realize I had blotted them <b>out</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> fixed my attention so intensely on the sunset. Then, as I recovered and became aware of my lack of abilities, I wondered how I was going to earn a living. I had already published a paper in a national agricultural journal. [...] "Why Young Folks Leave the Farm." [...] I no longer had the strength to be a farmer, but maybe I could make it as a doctor.|$|E
2500|$|Oates {{earned a}} {{scholarship}} to attend Syracuse University, where she joined Phi Mu. Oates found Syracuse [...] "a very exciting place academically and intellectually", and trained herself by [...] "writing novel after novel and always throwing them <b>out</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> completed them". It was not until this point that Oates began reading the work of Franz Kafka, D. H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann, and Flannery O'Connor though, she noted, [...] "these influences are still quite strong, pervasive". At the age of 19, she won the [...] "college short story" [...] contest sponsored by Mademoiselle. Oates graduated as valedictorian from Syracuse University {{with a degree in}} English in 1960 and received her M.A. from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1961. She was a Ph.D. student at Rice University when she made the decision to become a full-time writer.|$|E
2500|$|The 2nd Test match {{witnessed}} many controversial umpiring decisions {{from the}} two umpires - Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson and even the third Umpire. Three of Steve Bucknor's gaffes occurred {{when he did not}} give Andrew Symonds out caught behind at 30 when TV Replays clearly showed that the ball had passed through the bat's edge. The second one occurred when Bucknor did not refer a stumping call against Andrew Symonds to the third umpire. Replays showed the Australia all-rounder’s foot wasn't grounded inside the crease when the bails came off. This was a major boost for Australia as Symonds went on to make 162 not out and brought Australia back into the Game. After these incidents, Andrew Symonds said, [...] "I was very lucky. I was <b>out</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was 30, given not out. That's cricket though, I can sit here and tell you about my bad decisions as well - but I won't." [...] On the fifth day, Bucknor declared Rahul Dravid out caught behind though television replays later showed the ball had brushed his pad without touching his bat.|$|E

2500|$|Bill O'Reilly, {{not an easy}} man to impress, said it was {{the best}} Test innings he had ever seen and aged only 22 Cowdrey was the {{youngest}} Englishman to make an Ashes century since Jack Hearne on the same ground in [...] Although Cowdrey would make 22 Test centuries they would all be measured against the yardstick of his Melbourne hundred; [...] "his driving, concentration and command were all faultless ... a tribute to his wonderful ability". As Frank Tyson recalled, [...] "Runs did not flow; they were grafted from a pitch which kept the batsman hopping around as delivery after delivery tickled their ribs. Colin was icily superb.

On the origins of his rapper name, Ice Cube says that it came from his older brother. He is quoted as saying [...] "He threatened to slam me into a freezer and pull me <b>out</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was an ice cube. I just started using that name, and it just caught on." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film began {{shooting}} on May 1, 1995 {{but there was}} a week of pre-shooting at the end of April to film scenes that would be used as part of a mock documentary about Nixon's career. Early on during principal photography, Hopkins was intimidated by the amount of dialogue he had to learn, that was being added and changed all the time as he recalled, [...] "There were moments when I wanted to get <b>out,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wanted to just do a nice Knots Landing or something." [...] Sorvino told him that his accent was all wrong. Sorvino claims he told Hopkins that he thought [...] "there was room for improvement" [...] and that {{he would be willing to}} help him. Woods says that Sorvino told Hopkins that he was [...] "doing the whole thing wrong" [...] and that he was an [...] "expert" [...] who could help him. Woods recalls that Sorvino took Hopkins to lunch and then he quit that afternoon. Hopkins told Stone that he wanted to quit the production but the director managed to convince him to stay. According to the actors, this was all good-natured joking. Woods said, [...] "I'd always tell him how great he was in Psycho. I'd call him Lady Perkins all the time instead of Sir Anthony Hopkins." ...|$|E
