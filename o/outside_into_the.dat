5|$|De Launay {{had limited}} options: if he allowed the Revolutionaries to destroy his main gate, {{he would have}} to turn the cannon {{directly}} inside the Bastille's courtyard on the crowds, causing great loss of life and preventing any peaceful resolution of the episode. De Launay could not withstand a long siege, and he was dissuaded by his officers from committing mass suicide by detonating his supplies of powder. Instead, de Launay attempted to negotiate a surrender, threatening to blow up the Bastille if his demands were not met. In the midst of this attempt, the Bastille's drawbridge suddenly came down and the revolutionary crowd stormed in. De Launay was dragged <b>outside</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> streets and killed by the crowd, and three officers and three soldiers were killed {{during the course of the}} afternoon by the crowd. The soldiers of the Swiss Salis-Samade Regiment, however, were not wearing their uniform coats and were mistaken for Bastille prisoners; they were left unharmed by the crowds until they were escorted away by French Guards and other regular soldiers among the attackers. The valuable powder and guns were seized and a search begun for the other prisoners in the Bastille.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage {{to look at all}} the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, a monkey, a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts it on her shoulders. During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes {{in the middle of the}} room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them <b>outside</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> woods. Standing in the forest, she closes her eyes again and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E
25|$|One night, Mary {{hears the}} cries {{once more and}} decides to follow them through the house. She finds a boy named Colin living in a hidden bedroom. She soon discovers that they are cousins, Colin being the son of Mr and Mrs Craven, and that he suffers from an {{unspecified}} spinal problem. Mary visits him every day that week, distracting him from his troubles with stories of the moor, Dickon and his animals, and the secret garden. Mary finally confides that she {{has access to the}} secret garden, and Colin asks to see it. Colin is put into his wheelchair and brought <b>outside</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> secret garden. It is the first time he has been outdoors for years.|$|E

25|$|The body of John Paul II {{was exposed}} {{first in the}} Papal Residence and venerated by the Clergy before a procession, after which it was placed in St. Peter's Basilica; The Swiss Guard {{remained}} always beside the body while it was exposed for viewing. After {{the placement of the}} body before the Burial Site of St. Peter, the faithful who had gathered in St. Peter's Square were allowed to enter the Basilica to pray before the exposed body. It remained there before a private ceremony of the placement of the body in a cypress casket, and then was brought <b>outside</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Square for the funeral. For the funeral, the Swiss Guard departed the body to guard the Requiem Mass, presided by then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere, Carol (Melissa McBride) and Tyreese (Chad L. Coleman), {{caring for}} Rick's infant {{daughter}} Judith, {{are following the}} tracks to Terminus but hide from a walker horde. They hear a firework set off nearby and follow the noise to a cabin, manned by Martin (Chris Coy), in radio contact with Terminus and using the noise to direct the walker horde away from the train yard. Carol and Tyreese learn that Rick's group is captured inside, and the two quickly subdue Martin. Carol leaves Judith with Tyreese while she goes to help free the group. While she is gone, a group of walkers swarm {{the outside of the}} cabin. When Tyreese is distracted by the walkers, Martin grabs Judith and threatens to kill her unless Tyreese steps <b>outside</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> walker horde, unarmed. Tyreese does so but manages to survive and eliminate the walkers, then rushes inside to kill Martin, assuring Judith is unharmed.|$|E
25|$|A team of Vatican-sponsored vampire hunters led by Jack Crow rids an {{abandoned}} house of vampires {{in the middle}} of New Mexico during a daylight raid. The team uses a coordinated method of using battle pikes as harpoons, spearing vampires within the house so that a mechanical winch can pull them <b>outside</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> daylight. After clearing the house, the team celebrates at a local motel with drinking and prostitutes, to the disapproval of the Priest assigned to the team. Jack Crow defends the celebration, stating that given the horrors the team witnesses on a daily basis, this is an effective way to blow off steam. During the height of the party, with most of the team drunk, they are attacked swiftly by a master vampire called Valek, who kills most of the team and their priest. Only two members of the team survive, Jack Crow and Tony Montoya, as well as a prostitute named Katrina who was bitten by Valek. Crow later meets his boss, Cardinal Alba, who introduces him to Father Adam Guiteau.|$|E

500|$|Darla's {{role in the}} {{franchise}} increased dramatically after her resurrection by the law firm Wolfram & Hart in the final episode of Angels first season, titled [...] "To Shanshu in L.A." [...] In the second season opener, [...] "Judgement", Wolfram & Hart lawyers Lindsey McDonald and Lilah Morgan question Darla about her past. She talks of how she can feel Angel, and slowly her memory begins to return. In the episode [...] "First Impressions", Angel begins having romantic dreams about his maker. The dreams sap his strength. In [...] "Dear Boy", Angel is shocked to see Darla walking the streets. When he tells his partners, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce and Cordelia Chase, they think he is starting to lose his sanity. During {{the course of a}} stakeout by Angel Investigations of a woman suspected of having an affair, Angel confronts the woman, who looks exactly like Darla. She claims she is DeEtta Kramer. When she runs away from him, she walks <b>outside</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sunlight, meaning Darla has not only been resurrected, but is now human. However, Darla and Lindsey's plan to convert Angel back to evil fails. In the end, Wolfram & Hart bring in Drusilla to make Darla a vampire again after her syphilis returns and she starts to die. Ironically, she is turned back into a vampire as she accepts her fate after a failed attempt by Angel to save her. Drusilla and Darla unsuccessfully attack Angel and leave Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|Noriega {{dressed in}} his tan uniform, {{receiving}} permission to bring the Nuncio's bible with him, and went <b>outside</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark night with three priests who walked with him the fifty paces to the front gate; {{when he reached the}} front gate, a [...] "gigantic, enormous" [...] American soldier lunged at Noriega, described as [...] "a broken man," [...] {{and a number of other}} soldiers also tackled him to the ground and began searching his effects. His wrists were taped behind his back and he was bundled into a waiting American helicopter which took him to Howard Air Force Base.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{additional}} {{scene with}} Donna [...] {{was cut from}} the final episode: [...] "There was an additional Donna bit after this goodbye from the Doctor, which is when he goes <b>outside</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> TARDIS, we cut back into the kitchen, and there's a moment where Donna hears the TARDIS... there's a moment of realisation, and then she turns back round and carries on talking into the phone." [...] Gardner considered this scene untruthful and too confusing, since Donna remembering would lead to her death, and since she didn't recognise the Doctor it wouldn't make sense to assume she would recognise {{the noise of the}} TARDIS.|$|E
5000|$|The state {{government}} had no records about the Muria tribes {{living in the}} region or land ownership or revenue records. Thereafter, nearly 132 years after the previous survey, in 2005, the Government of Chhattisgarh initiated a project to map the area through an aerial survey {{at the cost of}} [...] Prior to 2006 a permit was required to enter the area. In June 2009, after a nearly 30-year restriction on <b>the</b> entry of <b>outsides</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> area, imposed by then Government of Madhya Pradesh, triggered by a controversial documentary made by a foreign channel, the Government of Chhattisgarh, a state carved out of Madhya Pradesh in 2000, eased the restrictions.|$|R
5000|$|A {{member of}} the Indian Military College Committee, Rahim was {{sometimes}} sceptical of British policy.

5000|$|A third use of [...] "royal doors" [...] is to {{indicate}} <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> entrance <b>into</b> <b>the</b> church. This {{appears to be}} a rare usage but appropriate to those churches that do not have a physical separation between the narthex and the nave.|$|R
2500|$|One day, {{while playing}} with his grandson, Kamin is summoned by his adult {{children}} to watch the launch of a rocket, which everyone seems to know about except him. As he walks <b>outside</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> glaring sunlight, Kamin sees Eline and Batai, as young as {{when he first saw}} them. They explain that he has already seen the rocket, just before he came there. Knowing that the planet was doomed, the planet's leaders placed the memories of their culture into a probe and launched it into space, in the hope that it would find someone who could tell others about their species. Picard then realizes the entire context: [...] "Oh, it's me, isn't it?", he says, [...] "I'm the someone...I'm the one it finds." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his theatre of {{the late}} period, Beckett's characters—already few in number in the earlier plays—are whittled down to {{essential}} elements. The ironically titled Play (1962), for instance, consists of three characters immersed up to their necks in large funeral urns. The television drama Eh Joe (1963), which was written for the actor Jack MacGowran, is animated by a camera that steadily closes in to a tight focus upon {{the face of the}} title character. The play Not I (1972) consists almost solely of, in Beckett's words, [...] "a moving mouth {{with the rest of the}} stage in darkness". Following from Krapp's Last Tape, many of these later plays explore memory, often in the form of a forced recollection of haunting past events in a moment of stillness in the present. They also deal with the theme of the self confined and observed, with a voice that either comes from <b>outside</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> protagonist's head (as in Eh Joe) or else another character comments on the protagonist silently, by means of gesture (as in Not I). Beckett's most politically charged play, Catastrophe (1982), which was dedicated to Václav Havel, deals relatively explicitly with the idea of dictatorship. After a long period of inactivity, Beckett's poetry experienced a revival during this period in the ultra-terse French poems of mirlitonnades, with some as short as six words long. These defied Beckett's usual scrupulous concern to translate his work from its original into the other of his two languages; several writers, including Derek Mahon, have attempted translations, but no complete version of the sequence has been published in English.|$|E

50|$|The breezeway {{through the}} center of the house is a unique feature, with rooms of <b>the</b> house opening <b>into</b> <b>the</b> breezeway.

60|$|In {{another minute}} he was posted {{at the back}} of the house, behind the edge of the wall.

25|$|Alternatively, a {{heat pump}} uses an {{electric}} motor to drive a refrigeration cycle, that draws heat energy from a source such as the ground or outside air and directs that heat <b>into</b> <b>the</b> space to be warmed.
