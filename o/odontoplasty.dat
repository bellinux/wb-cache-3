5000|$|Tooth {{reshaping}} removes {{parts of}} the enamel to improve {{the appearance of the}} tooth. It may be used to correct a small chip, or to alter the length, shape or position of teeth, as well as when there is Tooth Size Discrepancy; {{it can be used to}} correct crooked or excessively long teeth. The removed enamel is irreplaceable, and may sometimes expose dentin. It is also known as enameloplasty, <b>odontoplasty,</b> contouring, recontouring, slenderizing, stripping. This procedure offers fast results and can even be a substitute for braces under certain circumstances.|$|E
40|$|Periodontic - endodontic lesion with a palato-radicular groove as a {{contributing}} factor for periodontitis {{is the most important}} diagnostic and therapeutic challenges faced by periodontists and the maxillary lateral incisors are the most frequently affected teeth. These developmental grooves promotes the accumulation of plaque and calculus, which destroys the sulcular epithelium and later deeper parts of the periodontium, finally resulting in the formation of a severe localized periodontal lesion since proper cleaning of that site is difficult, if not impossible, for the patient. There are different types of treatment such as scaling and root planning, <b>odontoplasty,</b> amalgam restoration, and extraction of the tooth to treat palatogingival groove and associated periodontal bone defects. In this case, a successful management of an endodontic-periodontal combined lesion by combined treatment and guided tissue regeneration was presented...|$|E
40|$|Palatogingival grooves a {{developmental}} anamoly, initiate on the enamel and can extend a significant distance on the root surface, providing a plaque retentive {{area that is}} difficult to instrument. The diagnosis of these grooves is quite difficult, as they cannot be differentiated in the X-ray images. Specialized diagnostic techniques like 3 D computed tomography had been used for detecting the apico-coronal and bucco-lingual extent of these grooves. The treatment procedures employed for treating palatogingival grooves will include pulpectomy if the tooth is nonvital along with <b>odontoplasty</b> of the groove or restoration of the groove with GIC after the elevation of mucoperiosteal flap. Bone defects around the involved teeth also has to be treated with grafts and membrane. This case report describes the diagnosis and treatment of a palatogingival groove on maxillary lateral incisors...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial plaque {{has been}} implicated {{as the primary}} {{etiological}} factor in the initiation and progression of periodontal disease. Anatomic factors such as cervical enamel projections, enamel pearls, and developmental grooves are often associated with advanced, localized periodontal destruction. Enamel projections and pearls are mostly associated with molars. Enamel projections in the furcation areas of molars have no true attachment and are therefore highly susceptible {{to the creation of}} a deep periodontal pocket. A close association has been reported in the past between enamel projection and furcation involvement. Here, we present a case report with bilateral cervical-enamel projection and its management by flap operation with <b>odontoplasty,</b> and regenerative procedure by placement of graft in the osseous defect. Decreased pocket depth and a gain in clinical attachment level were observed on follow-up...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{retrograde}} periodontal lesion is a {{very rare}} condition of endodontic origin with secondary periodontal involvement. The presence of a concomitant palato-radicular groove (PRG) on a maxillary lateral incisor is not a common developmental anomaly. We report on the successful treatment of this condition through endodontic and periodontal therapy. Methods: This case report describes a pulpal periodontal condition occurring on a left maxillary lateral incisor in a 30 -year-old male, which was successfully treated by conventional endodontic therapy followed by periodontal treatment which included <b>odontoplasty</b> and apical flap surgery with bone grafting. Results: A 2 -year follow-up, which included a radiographic evaluation and surgical re-entry, revealed excellent healing with complete bone fill around the involved defect and total resolution of the lesion. Conclusion: The basis of our successful treatment was an accurate and timely diagnosis and elimination of all inflammatory irritants and other contributory factors. It is important for all clinicians {{to be aware of}} the existence of this abnormality...|$|E
40|$|Recognizing and {{managing}} the hidden tract in a maxillary incisor: A case report. J Int Oral Health 2015; 7 (6) : 110 - 114. Palatogingival grooves are developmental malformations quite notorious for precipitating endodontic- periodontal lesions. Owing to their inconspicuous occurrence, funnel-shaped morphology and variable extent on tooth root, they promote adherence of plaque and bacteria to levels {{significant for the}} development of pathology. Several treatment approaches have been recognized in literature for the management of this anomaly. Here in this report, a 25 -year-old patient reported with the complaint of pain and swelling in maxillary right lateral incisor. Clinical examination confirmed an endodontic- periodontal lesion in relation to palatogingival groove. Endodontic treatment was instituted, followed by <b>odontoplasty</b> of the groove and restoration with newer calcium silicate cement, Biodentine. Combined endodontic- periodontal approach was successful in resolving the pathology with complete healing seen both clinically and radiographically. Timely diagnosis, prevention and management are highly recommended to prevent tooth loss due to complications arising secondary to their presence...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} objective of orthodontic treatment is {{to deal with}} all kind of esthetic problems. In some cases the orthodontic treatment may cause periodontal defect and therefore would create another new esthetic problem. There are various surgical techniques that have been developed to repair the damage of the periodontium lately and further to improve esthetically. This paper reports a case of periodontium defect in form of 5 mm gingival recession, a hard tissue tumorlike on the mucogingiva and loss of interdental papilla, which had occurred on a patient who has had orthodontic treatment. The case was treated at two stage. At stage one, a vital pulpectomy, <b>odontoplasty</b> and coronally repositioned flap were performed consecutively. The second stage, combination of subepithelial connective tissue graft which obtained from the palate and coronally repositioned flap were performed a month following the first. After three months of observation, the result shows that the fingival recession were declined by 80 %, the tumorlike hard tissue disappeared and there was improvement on the interdental papilla size. Management of esthetic surgery with combination of both techniques performed in this cases has provided a satisfactory result as well as restores the esthetics proble...|$|E
