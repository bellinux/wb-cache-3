5|$|Following {{the orders}} of {{the captain of the}} Barracouta, Waddell {{immediately}} converted the warship back to a merchant ship, storing her cannon below, discharging all arms, and repainting the hull. At this point, Waddell decided to sail back to England and surrender the Shenandoah in Liverpool. Surrendering in an American port carried the certainty of facing a court with a Union point of view and the very real risk of a trial for piracy, for which he and the crew could be hanged. Sailing south around Cape Horn and staying well <b>off</b> <b>shore</b> to avoid shipping that might report Shenandoah's position, they saw no land for another 9,000 miles until they arrived back in England, having logged a total of over 58,000 miles around the world in a year's travel—the only Confederate ship to circumnavigate the globe.|$|E

40|$|This book {{contains}} 14 carefully {{reviewed and}} selected papers from the 4 th Workshop on Global Sourcing, held in Zermatt, Switzerland, March 22 - 25, 2010. They have been gleaned from a vast empirical base brought together by leading researchers of outsourcing and <b>off</b> <b>shoring.</b> This volume {{is intended for}} use by students, academics and practitioners interested in the outsourcing and <b>off</b> <b>shoring</b> of information technology and business processes. It offers {{a review of the}} key topics in outsourcing and <b>off</b> <b>shoring,</b> populated with practical frameworks that serve as a tool kit to students and managers. The sourcing models available to client firms are discussed in great depth. Vendor capabilities as well as client capabilities are studied and links are offered to the various sourcing models. Issues pertaining to knowledge and expertise are also discussed. Last but not least, the book examines current and future trends in outsourcing and <b>off</b> <b>shoring,</b> paying particular attention to the role that CIOs will play in shaping their sourcing strategies...|$|R

5|$|Once the beachhead {{had been}} secured, Omaha became the {{location}} {{of one of the}} two Mulberry harbors, prefabricated artificial harbors towed in pieces across the English Channel and assembled just <b>off</b> <b>shore.</b> Construction of 'Mulberry A' at Omaha began the day after D-Day with the scuttling of ships to form a breakwater. By D+10 the harbor became operational when the first pier was completed; LST 342 docking and unloading 78 vehicles in 38 minutes. Three days later the worst storm to hit Normandy in 40 years began to blow, raging for three days and not abating until the night of June 22. The harbor was so badly damaged that the decision was taken not to repair it; supplies being subsequently landed directly on the beach until fixed port facilities were captured. In the few days that the harbor was operational, 11,000 troops, 2,000 vehicles and 9,000 tons of equipment and supplies were brought ashore. Over the 100 days following D-Day more than 1,000,000 tons of supplies, 100,000 vehicles and 600,000 men were landed, and 93,000 casualties were evacuated, via Omaha.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} the class saw no further {{significant}} action during the war, and were ceded to the Allies {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Versailles. All four ships were stricken from the German navy on 5 November 1919. Helgoland was taken by the British and was scrapped in 1921 in Morecambe. Her bow ornament was retained and was eventually returned to Germany; it is now on display in the Dresden army museum. Oldenburg was surrendered to the Japanese, but they did not take possession of the ship. Instead, they sold the vessel to a British salvage firm that scrapped it in Dordrecht in 1921. Thüringen was taken by France; the ship was nearly scuttled by her crew while en route to Cherbourg in 1920. She was used as a target until she was beached in 1923 at Gavres. She was broken up in situ, but a large portion of the hull remains <b>off</b> <b>shore.</b>|$|E
5|$|Reinforcement regiments {{were due}} to land by battalion, {{beginning}} with the 18th RCT at 09:30 on Easy Red. The first battalion to land, 2/18, arrived at the E-1 draw 30 minutes late after a difficult passage through the congestion <b>off</b> <b>shore.</b> Casualties were light, though. Despite {{the existence of a}} narrow channel through the beach obstacles, the ramps and mines there accounted for the loss 22 LCVPs, 2 LCI(L)s and 4 LCTs. Supported by tank and subsequent naval fire, the newly arrived troops took the surrender at 11:30 of the last strong-point defending the entrance to the E-1 draw. Although a usable exit was finally opened, congestion prevented an early exploitation inland. The three battalions of the 115th RCT, scheduled to land from 10:30 on Dog Red and Easy Green, came in together and on top of the 18th RCT landings at Easy Red. The confusion prevented the remaining two battalions of the 18th RCT from landing until 13:00, and delayed the move off the beach of all but 2/18, which had exited the beach further east before noon, until 14:00. Even then, this movement was hampered by mines and enemy positions still in action further up the draw.|$|E

40|$|Requirements {{hand-over}} is {{a common}} practice in software development <b>off</b> <b>shoring.</b> Cultural and geographical distance between the outsourcer and supplier, and the differences in development practices hinder the communication and lead to the misinterpretation of the original set of requirements. In this article we advocate requirements quality certification using LSPCM as a prerequisite for requirements hand-over. LSPCM stands for LaQuSo Software Product Certification Model {{that can be applied}} by non-experienced IT assessors to verify software artifacts in order to contribute to the successfulness of the project. To support our claim we have analyzed requirements of three <b>off</b> <b>shoring</b> projects using LSPCM. Application of LSPCM revealed severe flaws in one of the projects. The responsible project leader confirmed later that the development significantly exceeded time and budget. In the other project no major flaws were detected by LSPCM and it was confirmed that the implementation was delivered within time and budget. Application of LSPCM to the projects above also allowed us to refine the model for requirements hand-over in software development <b>off</b> <b>shoring...</b>|$|R

25|$|Different onshore and <b>off</b> <b>shore</b> wind {{patterns}} in the surf zone create different types of waves. Onshore winds cause random wave breaking patterns and {{are more suitable for}} experienced surfers. Light offshore winds create smoother waves, while strong direct offshore winds cause plunging or large barrel waves. Barrel waves are large because the water depth is small when the wave breaks. Thus, the breaker intensity (or force) increases, and the wave speed and height increase. <b>Off</b> <b>shore</b> winds produce non-surfable conditions by flattening a weak swell. Weak swell is made from surface gravity forces and has long wavelengths.|$|E

We also find evidence that acquiring knowledge from forms outside the group is more profitable than in case they do it with forms within the group. Finally, the external acquisition of knowledge tends to present a higher return on breakthrough innovation in the case of taking such knowledge from the business sector and not from universities or research institutions...|$|R
