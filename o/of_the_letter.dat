5|$|The fourth {{letter was}} written in {{response}} to the many charges put forth by the British supporters of Wood's patent against the Irish, including claims of papal influence and of treason. A large portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> is a response to these accusations and to refuting further arguments that Wood's coin could be beneficial to the Irish people. The tone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> is clear: Wood's allies are promoting an evil that will harm Ireland. However, Wood is only a secondary target—figures like Walpole are mocked for their role in the controversy.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} {{told in the}} form of a letter from a wife and mother to her husband. The writer, Hester Hyman, had written the letter to explain why she had decided to {{sacrifice}} her life for the cause of democracy. While the text <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> was shown in captions, the pictures first illustrated events described in the early part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter,</b> and then showed the circumstances of her death at the hands of a squad of judges led by Judge Dredd.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter,</b> the {{estimated}} material {{necessary for a}} fission chain reaction was several tons. Seven months later a breakthrough in Britain would estimate the necessary critical mass {{to be less than}} 10 kilograms, making delivery of a bomb by air a possibility.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the recipient, {{the fate of}} her sons, and the authorship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter.</b> Bixby's character has been questioned (including rumored Confederate sympathies), {{at least two of}} her sons survived the war, and the letter was possibly written by Lincoln's assistant private secretary, John Hay.|$|E
5|$|Historian Michael Burlingame, who {{believes}} Hay is the author, {{has pointed out}} that Hay's scrapbooks have two newspaper clippings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> while largely containing Hay's own writing. However, they also contain material written by Lincoln including the Gettysburg Address and the Second Inaugural.|$|E

50|$|<b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 1,120 known <b>letters,</b> only 15 {{percent are}} signed, the others having been {{destroyed}} {{soon after they}} were read. However, in 1873, some early manuscript copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letters,</b> directly based on Mme de Sévigné's originals, were found in an antique shop. These accounted for about half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> to Mme de Grignan.|$|R
5|$|In 1988, at {{the request}} of {{investigator}} Joe Nickell, University of Kentucky professor of English Jean G. Pival studied the vocabulary, syntax, and other stylistic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> and concluded that it more closely resembled Lincoln's style of writing than Hay's. A computer analysis method used in a 2017 study by researchers at Aston University's Centre for Forensic Linguistics identified Hay as the letter's author nearly 90% of the time.|$|E

50|$|There {{also appears}} to be a {{simultaneous}} use of a monumental form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> and more everyday cursive form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> that occupied different uses in society, as can be evidenced by their appearances on inscriptions in the region from the era.|$|R

5|$|Some {{critics argue}} that Swift {{did not need to}} defend himself, and To Viscount Molesworth was written to gloat. However, the essence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> {{encourages}} the Irish to remember the actions of Walpole, Wood, and the British Parliament. By willingly throwing himself before the judgement of his fellow Irishmen and before the final judgement of God, the Drapier claims that he is and always will be on the correct side of the argument.|$|E

5|$|The French chemist Antoine Laurent Lavoisier later {{claimed to}} have {{discovered}} the new substance independently. Priestley visited Lavoisier in October 1774 and told him about his experiment and how he liberated the new gas. Scheele also posted a letter to Lavoisier on September 30, 1774 that described his discovery of the previously unknown substance, but Lavoisier never acknowledged receiving it (a copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> was found in Scheele's belongings after his death).|$|E

5|$|The Third Epistle of John, often {{referred}} to as Third John and written 3 John, is the antepenultimate book of the New Testament and attributed to John the Evangelist, traditionally thought to be the author of the Gospel of John and the other two epistles of John. The Third Epistle of John is a private letter composed to a man named Gaius, recommending to him a group of Christians led by Demetrius, which had come to preach the gospel in the area where Gaius lived. The purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> is to encourage and strengthen Gaius, and to warn him against Diotrephes, who refuses to cooperate with the author <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter.</b>|$|E
5|$|The letter {{caused a}} stir in the upper echelons of the Nazi regime. In his diaries, Joseph Goebbels, Reich Minister of Propaganda, assumed that someone in the German Catholic church {{organisation}} wrote, and distributed, the letter. A bounty of 100,000 Reichsmark, posted by the Führer himself, revealed no clues to its origins. Even the strongest repressive actions could not hinder the distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{few minutes}} later at 11:00, The Great Artiste dropped {{instruments}} attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor Ryokichi Sagane, a physicist at the University of Tokyo who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the University of California, Berkeley, urging him to tell {{the public about the}} danger involved with these weapons of mass destruction. The messages were found by military authorities but not turned over to Sagane until a month later. In 1949, one of the authors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter,</b> Luis Alvarez, met with Sagane and signed the document.|$|E

5|$|Although {{his suicide}} is often {{linked to the}} Foundation’s {{financial}} difficulties, the letter clearly shows Favaloro overwhelmed by {{the corruption of the}} health system and feeling that he could not fight against this powerful organization. In some parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter,</b> he refers to himself as “Don Quijote” in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Spaceman tells Tracy {{that he is}} dating Squeaky Fromme {{and says}} {{that she is a}} handful. Fromme {{is a member of the}} Manson Family, and was sentenced to life {{imprisonment}} for attempting to assassinate United States President Gerald Ford in 1975. Jenna and Danny begin arguing after the two are forced to share a dressing room. She takes down Danny's poster of the Montreal Alouettes, a Canadian Football League team based in Montreal, Quebec, which was signed by Marc Trestman, the head coach of the Alouettes. Jenna says that she took down the poster because it was tacky, as are his mother's chain e-mails (a message that attempts to induce the recipient to make a number of copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> and then pass them on to as many recipients as possible).|$|E
5|$|French typefounders of the 16th century assiduously {{examined}} Manutius's work (and, it is thought, De Aetna in particular) as {{a source}} of inspiration. This examination extended to in some cases copying his first 'M' shown in De Aetna which had no serif pointing out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> at top right, a design considered very eccentric. (It has been suggested {{to be the result of}} defective casting, especially since Manutius' later fonts do not show it.) The Griffo font was only cut in a single size, so French punchcutters made modified versions of the design to suit different sizes, with a more delicate structure at larger sizes.|$|E
