Some Babis, including Bahá'u'lláh's family, began searching for Bahá'u'lláh, and when news of a man living in the mountains {{under the name of}} Darvish Muhammad spread to neighboring areas, Bahá'u'lláh's family begged him to come back to Baghdad. On 19 March 1856, after two years in Kurdistan he returned to Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|Stephen was a well {{established}} figure in Anglo-Norman society by 1135. He was extremely wealthy, well-mannered and liked by his peers; {{he was also}} considered a man capable <b>of</b> <b>firm</b> action. Chroniclers recorded that despite his wealth and power he was a modest and easy-going leader, happy to sit with his men and servants, casually laughing and eating with them. He was very pious, {{both in terms of}} his observance of religious rituals and his personal generosity to the church. Stephen also had a personal Augustinian confessor appointed to him by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who implemented a penitential regime for him, and Stephen encouraged the new order of Cistercians to form abbeys on his estates, winning him additional allies within the church.|$|E

Holland's disregard for procedures governing the safe operation of the B-52 aircraft that he commanded and the absence <b>of</b> <b>firm</b> and consistent corrective action by his superior officers allowed Holland to believe that he could conduct his flight in an unsafe manner, culminating with the slow, steeply banked, 360° turn around the control tower.|$|E
40|$|Recent models <b>of</b> {{trade with}} <b>firm</b> {{heterogeneity}} predict that opening to trade reduces the number <b>of</b> <b>firms,</b> increases the average size <b>of</b> <b>firms,</b> and decreases firms’ markups. This paper uses a large dataset for 28 manufacturing industries and 46 countries to test these predictions. The econometric analysis {{based on the}} treatment effects literature shows that on average, trade liberalizations do not decrease the number <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> nor increase the average size <b>of</b> <b>firms.</b> Markups appear to decrease during the {{three years after the}} liberalization.

5|$|After another full {{examination}} in 1911, with {{comparisons to}} the Ashmolean head, archaeologists dismissed the Ashmolean head as a fake. The absence <b>of</b> <b>firm</b> {{evidence of the}} whereabouts of Cromwell's head between 1684 and 1787 made them wary about declaring the head genuine. They concluded their study unable to verify or refute the head's identity. The uncertainty increased public demand for a full scientific examination, and Wilkinson reluctantly allowed the head to be taken for examination by the eugenicist Karl Pearson and the anthropologist Geoffrey Morant. Their 109-page report {{concluded that there was}} a “moral certainty” that the Wilkinson head was that of Oliver Cromwell. Horace Wilkinson died in 1957, bequeathing the head to his son, also called Horace. Horace Wilkinson wished to organise a proper burial for the head rather than a public display, so he contacted Sidney Sussex College, which welcomed the burial. There it was interred on 25 March 1960, in a secret location near the antechapel, preserved in the oak box in which the Wilkinson family had kept the head since 1815. The box was placed into an airtight container and buried with only a few witnesses, including family and representatives of the college. The secret burial was not announced until October 1962.|$|E

25|$|King Stephen was {{extremely}} wealthy, well-mannered, modest and liked by his peers; {{he was also}} considered a man capable <b>of</b> <b>firm</b> action. His personal qualities as a military leader focused on his skill in personal combat, his capabilities in siege warfare and a remarkable ability to move military forces quickly over relatively long distances. Rumours of his father's cowardice during the First Crusade, however, continued to circulate, {{and a desire to}} avoid the same reputation may have influenced some of Stephen's rasher military actions. Stephen drew heavily on his wife, Queen Matilda, during the conflict, both for leading negotiations and maintaining his cause and army while imprisoned in 1141; Matilda led the royal household during this period in partnership with Stephen's mercenary leader William of Ypres.|$|E

Robertson gave an abusive response to the Lansdowne Memorandum (13 November 1916) (calling those who wanted to make peace “cranks, cowards and philosophers … miserable members of society”).|$|E
40|$|Innovation is a {{multilevel}} phenomenon. Not only characteristics <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> {{but also}} environment within which firms operate matter.

30|$|Table  4 {{shows the}} {{proportions}} <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> using some labour cost-cutting margin both for all {{firms in the}} sample and for those firms that were negatively affected by shocks. As expected, the proportion <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> using any labour cost-cutting margin increases within the sample <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> that were negatively affected {{by at least one}} shock. For instance, the share <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> that cut the number of employees, either permanent or temporary, increases from 33 % in the whole sample to 42 % in the sample <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> facing shocks. Perhaps more interesting is that the proportion <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> cutting employment reaches 75 % among firms that also cut non-base wages, 78 % among those that also cut their base wages and 86 % for those that cut both. These percentages are even higher if any of the shocks was deemed to be strong. This suggests that firms tend to use several available cost-cutting margins, the more so the more strongly they are hit by the crisis.|$|R

The idea of an ecological complex is developed to provide clear focus on what is central to the application of autecology to the study <b>of</b> <b>firms.</b> The paper also considers several emergent research opportunities that highlight the potential value of employing an autecological approach to the study <b>of</b> <b>firms...</b>|$|R

25|$|On April 10, 1854 Bahá'u'lláh left Baghdad {{in order}} to {{distance}} himself from Subh-i-Azal and as to avoid becoming the source of disagreement within the Babi community; he left with one companion to the mountains of Kurdistan, north-east of Baghdad, near the city Sulaymaniyah. For two years Bahá'u'lláh lived alone in the mountains of Kurdistan living the life of a Sufi dervish. At one point someone noticed his remarkable penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local Sufi orders.
