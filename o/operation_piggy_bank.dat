50|$|<b>Piggy</b> <b>bank</b> {{cryptography}} {{has been}} proposed for authenticating parties to detect man-in-the-middle attack. The <b>piggy</b> <b>bank</b> paradigm {{can be used to}} implement asymmetric as well as double-lock cryptography.|$|R
50|$|<b>Piggy</b> <b>bank</b> {{cryptography}} is {{a digital}} emulation of a <b>piggy</b> <b>bank.</b> It uses an encrypted message as a carrier into which valuable secrets can be inserted and later recovered {{by the person}} who issued the message.|$|R
50|$|<b>Piggy</b> <b>banks</b> {{are usually}} made of ceramic or porcelain. They are {{generally}} painted {{and serve as}} a pedagogical device to teach the rudiments of thrift and savings to children; money can be easily inserted. Many <b>piggy</b> <b>banks</b> have a rubber plug located on the underside; others are made of vinyl and have a removable nose for easy coin access. Some incorporate electronic systems which calculate the amount of money deposited. Some <b>piggy</b> <b>banks</b> do not have an opening besides the slot for inserting coins, which will lead to smashing the <b>piggy</b> <b>bank</b> with a hammer or by other means, to obtain the money within.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} round, each player begins with $1,000 and {{gets up to}} five turns to add to it. The players {{alternate}} in choosing from a set of ten <b>piggy</b> <b>banks.</b> When chosen, a <b>piggy</b> <b>bank</b> is opened to reveal its contents and remove it from further play. Seven of the <b>piggy</b> <b>banks</b> have amounts ranging from $1,000 to $20,000. The other three have the word [...] "Oink". Players accumulate values until {{one of the players}} has chosen two [...] "Oink"'s. That player leaves with half of his or her accumulated amount, or $500 if they hit two [...] "Oink"'s on their first two turns. The other player receives a $5,000 bonus and the option to leave with the accumulated winnings or go to the second round. In the second round, the player chooses one <b>piggy</b> <b>bank</b> out of five. Three of those <b>piggy</b> <b>banks</b> will halve the player's winnings, but the other two will either double or triple the winnings.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Piggy</b> <b>bank</b> (sometimes penny bank {{or money}} box) is the {{traditional}} name of a coin container normally used by children. The <b>piggy</b> <b>bank</b> is known to collectors as a [...] "still bank" [...] {{as opposed to the}} [...] "mechanical banks" [...] popular in the early 20th century. These items are also often used by companies for promotional purposes. The use of the name 'piggy bank' gave rise to its widely recognized 'pig' shape, and many financial services companies use <b>piggy</b> <b>banks</b> as logos for their savings products.|$|R

The Semantic Web Initiative {{envisions a}} Web wherein {{information}} is offered free of presentation, allowing more effective exchange and mixing across web sites and across web pages. But without substantial Semantic Web content, few tools will be written to consume it; without many such tools, {{there is little}} appeal to publish Semantic Web content. To break this chicken-and-egg problem, thus enabling more flexible informa-tion access, we have created a web browser extension called <b>Piggy</b> <b>Bank</b> that ex-tracts Semantic Web content from Web content as users browse the Web. Wherev-er Semantic Web content is not available, <b>Piggy</b> <b>Bank</b> can invoke screenscrapers to re-structure information within web pages into Semantic Web format.

It was dedicated on August 17, 1986, the market's 79th birthday, and is maintained by the Pike Place Market Foundation. Modeled after a pig (also named Rachel) that lived on Whidbey Island and was the 1977 Island County prize-winner, Rachel receives roughly $9,000 annually {{in just about every}} type of world currency, which is collected by the Market Foundation to fund the Market's social services.|$|R
5000|$|The Smithsonian Institution {{describes}} Rachel as a [...] "life-size, realistic figure" [...] of a sow <b>piggy</b> <b>bank.</b> The Pike Place Market Foundation {{calls it}} the [...] "mascot" [...] of Pike Place Market. The bronze sculpture depicts a pig with a money slot {{on the top of}} its head and measures approximately 36 x 66 x 16 in and weighs 550 lbs kg. Bronze foot prints are on the sidewalk leading to the pig figure. One nearby plaque reads: [...] "Market Foundation <b>Piggy</b> <b>Bank.</b> Made possible by a gift from Fratelli's Ice Cream, August 17, 1986". Another states that money deposited into the <b>piggy</b> <b>bank</b> benefits local human service organizations.|$|R

2500|$|Clay {{pottery and}} brick masonry are popular feature in Majapahit art and architecture. The Majapahit Terracotta art also flourished in this period. Significant numbers of {{terracotta}} artefacts {{were discovered in}} Trowulan. The artefacts ranges from human and animal figurines, jars, vessels, water containers, <b>piggy</b> <b>banks,</b> bas reliefs, architectural ornaments, roof pinnacles, floor tiles, to pipes and roof tiles. One {{of the most interesting}} findings is Majapahit <b>piggy</b> <b>bank.</b> Several boar-shaped <b>piggy</b> <b>banks</b> has been discovered in Trowulan. It is probably the origin of Javanese-Indonesian word to refer for saving or money container. The word celengan in Javanese and Indonesian means both [...] "savings" [...] and [...] "piggy bank". It was derived from the word celeng which means [...] "wild boar", the suffix [...] "-an" [...] was added to denote its likeness. One important specimen is stored in National Museum of Indonesia, it has been reconstructed since this large <b>piggy</b> <b>bank</b> has been found broken to pieces.|$|R
