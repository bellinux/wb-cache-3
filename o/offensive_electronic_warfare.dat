50|$|The British 18 (UKSF) Signal Regiment {{provides}} SIGINT personnel, including {{from the}} preexisting 264 (SAS) Signals Squadron and SBS Signals Squadron to provide specialist SIGINT, secure communications, {{and information technology}} augmentation to operational units. They may be operating in counterterror roles in Iraq in the joint UK/US TASK FORCE BLACK. If the unit needs to conduct <b>offensive</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare,</b> clandestinity requires that, at the very least, any ECM devices be operated remotely, either by the SR force or, preferably, by remote electronic warfare personnel after the SR team leaves the area.|$|E
50|$|The ACE {{supports}} the MAGTF {{by providing the}} six functions of Marine aviation: assault support, anti-air <b>warfare,</b> <b>offensive</b> air support, <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare,</b> control of aircraft and missiles, and aerial reconnaissance.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of aircraft usage within the MAGTF is for {{close air support}} or transport for the ground combat element (GCE) or logistics combat element (LCE), however, other specialized missions are available. The six main functions include: assault support, anti-air <b>warfare,</b> <b>offensive</b> air support, <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare,</b> control of aircraft and missiles, and aerial reconnaissance.|$|R
25|$|Today, Marine {{aviation}} is task {{organized to}} support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force, as the aviation combat element, by providing six functions: assault support, antiair <b>warfare,</b> <b>offensive</b> air support, <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare,</b> control of aircraft and missiles, and aerial reconnaissance. The Corps operates both rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft mainly to provide transport and close air support to its ground forces. However, other aircraft types are also used {{in a variety of}} support and special-purpose roles.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, the Canadian {{government}} announced a C$880 million upgrade, including new facilities, {{of the signal}} intelligence capability of the Communications Security Establishment Canada in Ottawa, {{to be completed by}} 2015. The importance of electronic warfare on the battlefield, as demonstrated in the War in Afghanistan, was highlighted in April 2010 by the formation of 21 Electronic Warfare Regiment at CFB Kingston. The unit, the first new regiment to be formed in the Canadian Army since WWII, is being equipped with the most modern electronic warfare technology and will practice both defensive and <b>offensive</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Fourth Department (4PLA) of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Joint Staff Department (JSD) is {{also known}} as the Electronic Countermeasures and Radar Department. It is charged with the PLA's <b>offensive</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare</b> (EW) and {{information}} warfare (IW) missions, to include offensive cyber operations. Based on PLA doctrine and 4PLA's mission, this department will almost certainly {{play a major role in}} future conflicts, including conflicts with the U.S. While information on 4PLA can be sparse, this paper will attempt to pull together many sources to provide an overview of 4PLA, to include its history, the role of an important 4PLA leader and the doctrine that he produced, 4PLA's responsibilities and mission, its organizational structure, 4PLA's relationship with other organizations in China, its locations and size, and how 4PLA and its related doctrine could be used in battle.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Electronic and Information Attack {{capability}} is increasingly able to undermine situational awareness, communications, {{command and control}} within modern high-technology combat systems, as reliance on COTS information systems, data pre- processing and knowledge management becomes deeply embedded in warfighting practice. <b>Offensive</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>warfare</b> using portable electronic devices and computers may soon provide powerful means to those who may wish to penetrate enemy's lines, deny lines of communication and engage in decisive battle, without the risk of ever being shot. This paper describes initial DSTO efforts to model, simulate and visualise electronic/information attack in tandem with physical combat. Simulation technology that provides battlefield capability through applications such as command decision support, real-time operational analysis, mission visualisation/awareness, and logistic/materiel support, needs {{to be mindful of}} new threats in the next decade. 1...|$|E
