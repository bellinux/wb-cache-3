Soon thereafter, California's friends, skilled musicians themselves, arrive to join in. Not having brought their <b>own</b> <b>instruments,</b> two of them take over Kevin's drums and Darryl's synthesizer, while Andy's {{acoustic}} guitar is {{drowned out by the}} newcomer's electric guitar. The three of them are thus relegated to playing percussion. Andy, Kevin and Darryl, with the help of warehouse worker Val, realize that they were ousted, and after a failed attempt to try getting their original band roles back, they instead satisfyingly jam outside by themselves.|$|E

25|$|European {{immigration}} brought {{important changes}} to Argentina's popular music, {{especially in the}} Litoral; where new genres appeared, like chamamé and purajhei (or Paraguayan polka). Chamamé appeared {{in the second half}} of the 18th century -though it was not named as such until the 1930s- as a result of the fusion of ancient Guaraní rhythms with the music brought by the Volga German, Ukrainian, Polish and Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants that settled in the region.

500|$|In {{the country}} music {{industry}} particularly, record producers hire mostly session musicians to record tracks for an album for both solo artists and bands, as opposed to rock bands who record their own instrumental and vocal tracks on their albums.

500|$|Alabama {{has been}} {{credited}} with [...] "substantially broadening country's audience while {{becoming one of the}} most popular acts in American musical history" [...] by Michael McCall of The Encyclopedia of Country Music. The band was notable for its three-person lead (as [...] "most other country acts focused on a soloist accompanied by an anonymous band"), their collective hair length and facial hair (which would have been deemed unacceptable just a decade earlier), and their prominent electric bass and drums. They had a slightly edgier sound than other groups, and both played their <b>own</b> <b>instruments</b> and wrote their own songs. Alabama mostly appealed to a younger audience, although their clean-cut image appealed to the more conservative, older country audience as well. Kurt Wolff described the band's appeal: [...] "They're just rebel enough for the young folks, but their parents also dig the boys' pretty harmonies, sentimental soft spots, and old-fashioned family values." [...] Alabama gave prominence to their hometown of Fort Payne, and also raised awareness for environmental issues.|$|E
500|$|Andy's bandmates {{during the}} rock show scene were played by Mark Rivers (drums), Andrew Burlinson (guitar) and Alan Yang (bass). All four actors {{performed}} their <b>own</b> <b>instruments</b> live during the filming.

Yang is a writer with Parks and Recreation, and wrote the previous first season episode, [...] "Boys' Club". Rivers is a composer who has worked on the sketch comedy show Human Giant, which starred Parks star Aziz Ansari. Rivers wrote the songs performed in [...] "Rock Show", which Pratt said took him only [...] "about fifteen minutes". [...] Hiscock wrote the lyrics for [...] "The Pit" [...] in the initial outline for the episode and they were handed to Rivers who then fleshed them out. [...] The songs were designed to resemble the music of the American rock band Hootie & the Blowfish. The only song not written by Rivers was [...] "Ann", a romantic ballad Andy played for Ann, which was written by Pratt himself. [...] "Ann" [...] first appeared in [...] "Boys' Club".|$|E

500|$|One of Swift's {{earliest}} musical memories {{is listening}} to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing at church. As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: [...] "My parents noticed that, once I {{had run out of}} words, I would just make up my own". Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child. She also attributes her [...] "fascination with writing and storytelling" [...] to her mother. Swift was drawn to the storytelling of country music, and was introduced to the genre by [...] "the great female country artists of the '90s"—Shania Twain, Faith Hill and the Dixie Chicks. Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence. Hill was Swift's childhood role model: [...] "Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it". She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their <b>own</b> <b>instruments.</b> The band's [...] "Cowboy Take Me Away" [...] was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar. Swift also explored the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. She believes Parton is [...] "an amazing example to every female songwriter out there". Alt-country artists such as Ryan Adams, Patty Griffin and Lori McKenna have inspired Swift.|$|E
500|$|The Wrecking Crew {{continued}} to be in demand in the early 1970s, even enjoying several hits, {{but by the end}} of 1973 they began to experience a downturn in bookings, as a series of changes in the recording industry began to take hold. [...] Unlike earlier bands such as the Monkees and the Grass Roots, who often utilized the Wrecking Crew for backing tracks, and perhaps because of it, rock groups in the early 1970s began having it stipulated in their recording contracts that they be allowed to play their <b>own</b> <b>instruments</b> on records. [...] By the early 1970s, younger session players such as Larry Carlton, Andrew Gold, Danny Kortchmar, Waddy Wachtel, Russ Kunkel, Jeff Porcaro, Leland Sklar, and Jim Keltner arrived with a more contemporary sound well-suited to the changing musical tastes of the unfolding decade. [...] By the mid-1970s, particularly with the arrival of 16-track and 24-track tape recording machines and automated large-format multi-channel consoles, advances in recording technology made it viable for instruments to be recorded, often close-miked, onto separate tracks individually, reducing the need to hire ensembles to play live in the studio. [...] Synthesizers were brought in which could approximate the sound of practically any instrument and, eventually, drum machines would become the norm, which could be specially programmed to keep beats in place of a drummer or be used for click tracks played in musicians' headphones, making it easier to overdub or re-record any part in-synch and achieve a more uniform and consistent tempo. [...] By the mid-1970s many of the Wrecking Crew's members scattered and drifted into different spheres. [...] Though the unit did a brief, but ill-fated reunion session with Phil Spector in 1992, and more recently backed Glen Campbell in his song [...] "I'm Not Gonna Miss You" [...] taken from the soundtrack of the 2015 documentary , they have spent most of the last four decades engaged in separate projects.|$|E
