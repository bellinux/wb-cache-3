40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{utilisation}} pattern <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> and emergency services and {{to study the}} possible impact of a user-fee policy on non-emergency attendances in Hong Kong. DESIGN: Retrospective study. METHODS: Four different scenarios are postulated to examine {{the impact on the}} number <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> and emergency attendances of a user-fee policy from 2000 to 2029. Patient volume data <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> and emergency attendances for 2000 were made available by the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong. RESULTS: Non-emergency use <b>of</b> the <b>accident</b> and emergency services is the main cause of over-utilisation and contributes to more than 70. 0 % of its use. Only 22. 0 % <b>of</b> patients attending <b>accident</b> and emergency departments were admitted to a ward for further treatment. By 2029, the number <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> and emergency attendances would increase by more than 47. 0 % if the present utilisation pattern prevails. However, if patients at triage levels 3, 4, and 5 were discouraged from using the accident and emergency services, the number of attendances would decrease by 76. 4 %. CONCLUSION: The proposed user-fee policy would act as a deterrent by preventing unnecessary use <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> and emergency services. However, the use of out-patient services may be increased as a result and attendance should be carefully monitored. Community health education and civic education relating to abuse <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> and emergency services would be effective in reducing over-utilisation of these services. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

5|$|The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 proved {{insufficient}} in its {{objective of}} encouraging privately built and run nuclear reactors.

This led to the Price–Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act of 1957, which capped private liability for nuclear accidents, while providing for adequate compensations for accident victims.|$|E
