5|$|Keynesian {{principles}} fared increasingly {{poorly on}} the practical side of economics – by 1979 {{they had been}} displaced by monetarism as the primary influence on Anglo-American economic policy. However, many <b>officials</b> <b>on</b> {{both sides of the}} Atlantic retained a preference for Keynes, and in 1984 the Federal Reserve officially discarded monetarism, after which Keynesian principles made a partial comeback as an influence on policy making.|$|E
5|$|On January28 while Firinga was {{approaching}} Réunion, <b>officials</b> <b>on</b> the island issued a level1 tropical cyclone alert on the Organisation de la Réponse de SÉcurité Civile (ORSEC) plan.

5|$|An Italian volcanological mission {{analyzed}} gas {{samples from}} fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor {{and found them}} to be a mixture of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. Publishing a report for <b>officials</b> <b>on</b> October 22, 1985, the scientists determined that the risk of lahars was unusually high. To prepare for the eruption, the report gave several simple preparedness techniques to local authorities. Another team gave the local officials seismographs, but no instructions on how to operate them.|$|E
5|$|As it {{approached}} the Yucatán Peninsula, Janet {{passed over the}} Swan Islands north of Honduras as a Category5 hurricane on September27. The hurricane caused rough seas, and strong winds uprooted trees and antennas. After gusts exceeded an estimated 100mph (160km/h), <b>officials</b> <b>on</b> the islands took shelter in a Navy seismograph building. Though no deaths were reported, Janet destroyed almost all buildings on the islands. The U.S. Weather Bureau and Civil Aeronautics Authority requested food and supplies for 82people on the island after the storm passed.|$|E
5|$|Both the Inspector and Governor were {{responsible}} for inspecting commandery-level Administrators and their staffs, {{as well as the}} semi-autonomous kingdoms and their staffs. They evaluated <b>officials</b> <b>on</b> criteria of competence, honesty, obedience to the imperial court, adherence to the law, their treatment of convicts, and any signs of extortion, nepotism, or factionalism. These reports were submitted to the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk and Imperial Counselor during Western Han, but by Eastern Han these reports were submitted to each of the Three Excellencies. The reports were then used to promote, demote, dismiss, or prosecute local officials.|$|E

5|$|Colt was {{the first}} American {{manufacturer}} to use art as a marketing tool when he hired Catlin to prominently display Colt firearms in his paintings. He was awarded numerous government contracts after making gifts of his highly embellished and engraved revolvers with exotic grips such as ivory or pearl to government <b>officials.</b> <b>On</b> a trip to Constantinople he gave a custom-engraved and gold inlaid revolver to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Abdülmecid I, informing him that the Russians were buying his pistols, thus securing a Turkish order for 5,000 pistols; he neglected to tell the Sultan he had used the same tactic with the Russians to elicit an order.|$|E
5|$|Coordination {{of rescue}} efforts August 29 and August 30 were made {{difficult}} by {{disruption of the}} communications infrastructure. Many telephones, including most cell phones, and Internet access were inoperable because of line breaks, destruction of base stations, or power failures, even though some base stations had their own back-up generators. In a number of cases, reporters were asked to brief public <b>officials</b> <b>on</b> the conditions in areas where information was not reaching them any other way.|$|E
5|$|Elected <b>officials</b> <b>on</b> Staten Island such as Diane Savino {{have been}} {{demanding}} {{the replacement of}} the Staten Island Railway's aging R44 train cars. Initially, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority planned to order R179s for the Staten Island Railway, but later decided to overhaul some R46s to replace the existing R44s there. However, the plan to overhaul the R46s for the Staten Island Railway was also dropped, and 75 future R211S cars are planned to replace the Staten Island Railway's fleet of R44s instead. Until then, the R44s are undergoing another round of scheduled maintenance to extend their usefulness until at least 2023.|$|E

5|$|In August 1522, Martim Afonso de Melo Coutinho {{arrived at}} Tuen Mun with three ships, {{unaware of the}} {{conflict}} and expecting to meet with Chinese <b>officials</b> <b>on</b> establishing consent for a Portuguese trade base in China. Two of his ships were captured in a surprise Chinese attack, while the survivors escaped back to Portugal on the third ship (see Second Battle of Tamao). These encounters and others with the Portuguese brought the first breech-loading culverins into China, mentioned even by the philosopher and scholar-official Wang Yangming in 1519 when he suppressed Zhu Chenhao's rebellion in Jiangxi.|$|E
5|$|In June 1968, an {{agreement}} was reached where the state Transportation Assistance Authority would pay $2 million and Penn Central would pay $2.5 million for the 11 Metroliners for Harrisburg service. On July 14, a 4-car train was tested on the line, with several demonstration runs for <b>officials</b> <b>on</b> August 21. In early October, several test trains proved {{the viability of the}} planned sub-3-hour schedules. Substation modifications later that month and a legal settlement between Budd and Penn Central in November paved the way for service to begin. On December 20, Penn Central announced that Metroliner service would begin on January 16, 1969.|$|E
5|$|On Alamagan, {{residents}} {{attempted to}} contact <b>officials</b> <b>on</b> other islands on September17. Despite the extreme {{intensity of the}} storm, all sixteen residents on the island, including the 4-day old infant were safe. During their attempted contact, the connection was poor and hard to understand. The following day, the United States Navy sent a ship and helicopter to the island to assess the situation. The Navy stated that the entire island of Alamagan was a total loss, with {{all but one of}} the structures, a facility for laboratory and research, completely destroyed and most of the islands' trees downed.|$|E

5|$|The Meermin slave mutiny {{took place}} in February 1766 and lasted for three weeks. Meermin {{was one of the}} Dutch East India Company's fleet of slave ships. Her final voyage was cut short by the mutiny of her cargo of Malagasy people, who had been sold to Dutch East India Company <b>officials</b> <b>on</b> Madagascar to be used as company slaves in its Cape Colony in {{southern}} Africa. During the mutiny half the ship's crew and almost 30Malagasy lost their lives.|$|E
5|$|The Willie Mays World Series Most Valuable Player Award {{is given}} to the player who most {{contributes}} to his team's success in the final round of the Major League Baseball post-season. The award was originally given by the editors of Sport magazine, but is now decided by a combination of media members and Major League Baseball <b>officials.</b> <b>On</b> September 29, 2017, it was renamed in honor of Willie Mays in remembrance of the 63rd anniversary of The Catch. Mays never won the award himself. The current award holder is Houston Astros center fielder George Springer, who hit a record-tying five home runs in the 2017 World Series.|$|E
5|$|Three men {{sought the}} Democratic {{nomination}} for governor at the 1899 party convention in LouisvilleGoebel, Wat Hardin, and William J. Stone. When Hardin {{appeared to be}} the front-runner for the nomination, Stone and Goebel agreed to work together against him. Stone's supporters would back whomever Goebel picked to preside over the convention. In exchange, half the delegates from Louisville, who were pledged to Goebel, would vote to nominate Stone for governor. Goebel would then drop out of the race, but would name many of the other <b>officials</b> <b>on</b> the ticket. As word of the plan spread, Hardin dropped out of the race, believing he would be beaten by the Stone–Goebel alliance.|$|E

5|$|Around an {{hour after}} the start of the race, three {{children}} were struck by car driven by one of the race <b>officials</b> <b>on</b> a side road from Quarter Bridge Road, near the finish line. None sustained serious injuries; two of them had cuts dressed, while the third rushed back to watching the racing. Another, more serious, accident occurred on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which had been transporting people up the mountain to watch the racing. A tramcar that had been descending the railway had broken down, and a second car had stopped close behind it. A third tram, on rounding the bend above them, was unable to stop in time and collided into the rearmost car, which was then propelled into {{the car in front of}} it. Minor injuries were sustained by some of the passengers, though none were serious.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in San Francisco {{after having}} been {{released}} from questioning by immigration <b>officials</b> <b>on</b> Angel Island on 11 August 1918, Prokofiev was soon compared to other famous Russian exiles (such as Sergei Rachmaninoff). His debut solo concert in New York led to several further engagements. He also received a contract from the {{music director of the}} Chicago Opera Association, Cleofonte Campanini, for the production of his new opera The Love for Three Oranges; however, due to Campanini's illness and death, the premiere was postponed. The delay was another example of Prokofiev's bad luck in operatic matters. The failure also cost him his American solo career since the opera took too much time and effort. He soon found himself in financial difficulties, and in April 1920, he left for Paris, not wanting to return to Russia as a failure.|$|E
5|$|At {{the moment}} of impact, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was in his office {{on the other side}} of the Pentagon, away from the crash site. He ran to the site and {{assisted}} the injured. Rumsfeld returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President Dick Cheney and other <b>officials.</b> <b>On</b> the day of the attacks, DoD officials considered moving their command operations to Site R, a backup facility in Pennsylvania. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, and sent Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Site R. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) continued to operate at the Pentagon, even as smoke entered the facility. Engineers and building managers manipulated the ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC and bring in fresh air.|$|E
