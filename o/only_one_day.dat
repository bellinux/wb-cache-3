5|$|The {{headland}} at Braich y Pwll is {{the only}} known location on the British mainland of the spotted rock rose, which produces bright yellow petals that last <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>day.</b> The coast here has open grass heath land and mountain, giving way to rugged sea cliffs and coves. There is a profusion of wildlife, {{and it is an}} ideal vantage point to watch the spring and autumn bird migrations. Choughs, peregrine falcons, kestrels, puffins, stonechats, guillemots and Manx shearwaters can be seen, and dolphins, porpoises and seals can be spotted in the water.|$|E
5|$|According to the Coat of Arms Act, {{everyone}} {{can use the}} Polish flag, especially during national and cultural events, {{as long as it}} is done in a respectful manner. This liberty in the use of national colors is a relative novelty. Until 2004, Polish citizens were only allowed to fly the Polish flag on national holidays. The use of both variants was restricted, but only flying the flag with coat of arms was, from 1955 until 1985, punishable by a fine or arrest for up to one year. After 1985, unauthorized use of any national symbols was an infraction. A possible explanation to such harsh measures was the fact that the officially-promoted holiday of May 1st was separated by <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> from the pre-war (and current) national holiday of Poland, the anniversary of signing of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. While hoisting a flag on May 1 was acceptable, no later than the following day it must have been hidden.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Liverpool, {{he was put}} in charge of the Clarendon Furnishing shop in Hoylake and was made a director of NEMS in 1955. In September 1956, he took a trip to London to meet a friend but after being there for <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>day,</b> was robbed of his passport, birth certificate, chequebook, wristwatch, and all the money he had on him. He did not want his parents to find out, so he worked as a department store clerk until he had earned enough money to buy a train ticket back to Liverpool. Back in Liverpool, he confessed his homosexuality to a psychiatrist—a friend of the Epstein family—who suggested to Harry Epstein that his son should leave Liverpool as soon as possible. During the sessions, Epstein revealed his ambition of becoming an actor, so his parents allowed him go to London to study.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 68 post-Revolution {{governors}} of the state, serving 72 distinct spans in office. The longest terms in office {{were in the}} state's early years, when four governors were elected to nine or more one-year terms. The longest {{was that of the}} first governor, Jonathan Trumbull, who served over 14 years, but 7 of those as colonial governor; the longest-serving state governor — with no other position included in the term — was his son, Jonathan Trumbull, Jr., who served over 11 years. The shortest term was that of Hiram Bingham III, who served <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> before resigning to take an elected seat in the U.S. Senate. Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., is noted for a rare third party win in American politics, having been elected to a term in 1990 representing A Connecticut Party.|$|E
5|$|William Penn {{stayed in}} Wells shortly {{before leaving for}} America (1682), {{spending}} a night at The Crown Inn. Here he was briefly arrested for addressing a large crowd in the market place, but released on {{the intervention of the}} Bishop of Bath and Wells. During the Monmouth Rebellion (1685) the rebel army attacked the cathedral in an outburst against the established church and damaged the west front. Lead from the roof was used to make bullets, windows were broken, the organ smashed and horses stabled in the nave. Wells was the final location of the Bloody Assizes on 23 September 1685. In a makeshift court lasting <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>day,</b> over 500 men were tried and the majority sentenced to death.|$|E

5|$|Horizon Zero Dawn was {{the best-selling}} game during its release {{week in the}} UK. It surpassed No Man's Sky as the biggest launch of a new {{intellectual}} property on the PlayStation 4 and is the most successful launch of any kind on the PlayStation 4 since , as well as Guerrilla Games' biggest debut to date. The game sold close to 117,000 copies in its first week in Japan, becoming the second best-selling game that week. Horizon Zero Dawn was the second most downloaded game on the PlayStation 4 US store {{for the month of}} February. Because its launch day occurred {{on the last day of}} February, <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> of sales was counted. It was the best-selling game in its week of release in Australia. For the month of March, it was the second best-selling game in the United Kingdom and the highest selling PlayStation 4 game. Horizon Zero Dawn was also the best-selling game on PlayStation Store that month. As of 13 March 2017, the game had sold over 2.6 million copies worldwide. It was ranked number one in the UK sales chart of 22 April 2017, and took eighth place in the Japanese chart of 16 April. 3.4 million copies had been sold by the month of June 2017 – of which, 915,000 were digital.

5|$|In mid-1912, {{due to the}} Agadir Crisis, {{the summer}} cruise was {{confined}} to the Baltic, to avoid exposing the fleet {{during the period of}} heightened tension with Britain and France. In September, following the autumn maneuvers, Deutschland suffered a grounding while in the Baltic. The resulting damage necessitated dry-docking, and repairs were completed by November, allowing the ship {{to take part in the}} winter cruise in the Baltic. In October, during the repair period, KzS Hugo Meurer took command of the ship. On 30 January 1913, Holtzendorff was relieved as the fleet commander, owing in large part due to Wilhelm II's displeasure with his strategic vision. Vizeadmiral (VAdm—Vice Admiral) Friedrich von Ingenohl took Holtzendorff's place that day; but <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> later, on the 31st, he lowered his flag aboard Deutschland to transfer to the new dreadnought , which replaced Deutschland as flagship. The golden bow ornament that denoted the flagship was removed, and Deutschland returned to the ranks of the II Battle Squadron. The year's training proceeded in much the same pattern as in previous years. Deutschland briefly resumed flagship duties in late 1913, as Friedrich der Grosse was in dry-dock for periodic maintenance.|$|E
