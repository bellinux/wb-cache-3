Equatorial Africa has high levels of UV radiation, and because <b>ozone</b> <b>shields</b> UV radiation from reaching the Earthâ€™s surface, {{there is a need}} to monitor TOCAs and EUV doses.

The TOCAs were found to vary in the ranges 243 DU âˆ’ 289 DU, 231 DU âˆ’ 286 DU, and 236 DU âˆ’ 296 DU, with mean values of 266. 9 DU, 260. 9 DU, and 267. 8 DU for Dar-es-Salaam, Kampala and Serrekunda, respectively.

40|$|Understanding {{the impact}} of active M-dwarf stars on the {{atmospheric}} equilibrium and surface conditions of a habitable zone Earth-like planet is key to assessing M dwarf planet habitability. Previous modeling of {{the impact of}} electromagnetic (EM) radiation and protons from a single large flare on an Earth-like atmosphere indicated that significant and long-term reductions in ozone were possible, but the atmosphere recovered. These stars more realistically exhibit frequent flaring with a power-law distribution of energies. Here we use a coupled 1 D photochemical and radiative-convective model to investigate the effects of repeated flaring on the photochemistry and surface UV of an Earth-like planet unprotected by an intrinsic magnetic field. We use time-resolved flare spectra obtained for the dM 3 star AD Leo, combined with flare occurrence frequencies and total energies (typically 10 $^{ 30. 5 }$ to 10 $^{ 34 }$ erg) from the 4 -year Kepler light curve for the dM 4 flare star GJ 1243. Our model results show repeated EM-only flares have little effect on the ozone column depth, but that multiple proton events can rapidly destroy the ozone column. Combining the realistic flare and proton event frequencies with nominal CME & SEP geometries, we find the ozone column for an Earth-like planet can be depleted by 94 % in 10 years, with a downward trend that makes recovery unlikely and suggests further destruction. For more extreme stellar inputs O 3 depletion allows a constant 0. 1 - 1 W m$^{- 2 }$ of UV-C at the planet's surface, which is likely detrimental to organic complexity.
