5000|$|Another {{difference}} from the crosscut saw is that the edges are sharpened {{at right angles to}} the cutting plane, forming chisel-like cutting surfaces, whereas the crosscut saw is sharpened at an angle, so that each tooth has a knife-like cutting point in contact with the wood. This design keeps the saw from following grain lines, which could curve the path of the saw: by acting like a chisel, the saw can more easily cut across deviating grain lines, which is necessary if a straight cut is to be achieved. This feature enables the <b>orthogonal</b> <b>cutting</b> edge to efficiently transport wood-chips from the kerf, allowing subsequent teeth to perform a more effective cut.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} force {{model is}} presented to simulate the cutting force and the chip flow direction in the drilling process. Three dimensional chip flow is interpreted as a piling up of the <b>orthogonal</b> <b>cuttings</b> in the planes containing the cutting velocities and the chip flow velocities. The chip flow direction is determined to minimize the cutting energy. The simulation is performed to discuss {{the effect of the}} lip geometry on burr formation at the backside of the plate.

The curved lips drill is examined to reduce the thrust and control the chip flow with the orientation and the curvature of the lips. The counterclockwise orientation with the small curvature is effective in reducing burr formation in the simulation. A drill is designed to have the counterclockwise curved shapes on the straight lips. The designed lips flow the chip upward to avoid the chip clogging in the steady process.

This paper {{proposes a}} method of {{determining}} the constitutive equation parameters of a Japanese type of alloy steel (SCM 440 H) for Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of <b>orthogonal</b> <b>cutting,</b> involving pressure bar experiments, orthogonal metal cutting experiments and FEA inverse identi-fication.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{conditions}} of chip propagation or fracture in <b>orthogonal</b> oblique <b>cutting</b> of beech wood (Fagus silvatica) in the 90 ° direction for a type-I chip has been investigated. The force required for <b>orthogonal</b> wood <b>cutting</b> is pronouncedly variable, which is the consequence of exchangeable different ways of material breakdown. The chip formation process is discontinuous because of interrupted splitting of the material {{in front of the}} cutting tool. A 10 -mm-thick specimen was cut at a rake angle of 31 ° and 42 ° with chip thicknesses ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 3 mm. The chip segment length increased with the chip thickness. A chip of varying length and thickness was modelled using the finite element method. For each case, the bending or compressive stress in the chip and the stress intensity factor at the crack tip was calculated. The segment length of the chip can be calculated by taking into account the condition that a crack propagates when the stress intensity factor K I at the crack tip equals the critical stress intensity factor K IC, and the bending or compressive stress sigma x in the chip is smaller than the strength sigm u. Good agreement between the calculated and the measured values was observed. The chip segment length can change considerably already with small changes in the bending strength and critical stress intensity factor. This large sensitivity is also confirmed by the fluctuation of the measured chip segment lengths by as much as 400 %...|$|R
