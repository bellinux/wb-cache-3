25|$|Parker {{made his}} last public {{appearances}} in 1994. By this point, {{he was a}} sick man who could barely leave his own house. On January 20, 1997, Parker's wife heard a crashing sound from the living room, and when she heard no response to her calls, she went in to find him slumped <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair. He had suffered a stroke.|$|E
25|$|A {{few minutes}} later, Moutardier found Reid leaning <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> seat, and unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to get his}} attention. After she {{asked him what he}} was doing, Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match. He was unable to detonate the bomb: perspiration from his feet dampened the TATP and prevented it from igniting.|$|E
25|$|Krazy Kat {{evolved from}} an earlier comic strip of Herriman's, , which started in June 1910 and was later renamed The Family Upstairs. This comic chronicled the Dingbats' {{attempts}} to avoid the mischief of the mysterious unseen family living in the apartment above theirs and to unmask that family. Herriman would complete the cartoons about the Dingbats, and finding himself with time left <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> 8-hour work day, filled {{the bottom of the}} strip with slapstick drawings of the upstairs family's mouse preying upon the Dingbats' cat.|$|E
50|$|Camplin bowled 24 <b>overs</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> List A career, taking four wickets, {{including}} that of Butch White on his debut.|$|R

50|$|Tharaka bowled nine <b>overs</b> <b>in</b> the match. Bowling two <b>overs</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first innings, Tharaka took {{figures of}} 3-0, {{securing}} the wickets of Lushan Kuruppu, Dinesh Seneviratne, and Ujitha Eranga without conceding a single run.|$|R
25|$|Australia won the toss after Andrew Flintoff called heads. Ricky Ponting {{elected to}} bat {{on a good}} looking pitch. Steve Harmison bowled the opening over, with the first ball a wide that went {{straight}} to Andrew Flintoff at second slip. Harmison only lasted two overs, which went for 17 runs, before being replaced by James Anderson. Anderson proved just as expensive as Harmison, conceding 10 runs in his first <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first Test match for seven months. Andrew Flintoff got Matthew Hayden to edge one to second slip on 21. Australia reached lunch without further loss on 1/79.|$|E
25|$|After an {{impressive}} {{start to the}} County season, including a 14-wicket match haul, he was chosen again to face Bangladesh, this time in England. In the first match at Lord's, his home debut, he took a 5-wicket-haul in the second innings as England won by eight wickets, finishing with nine wickets in the match. In doing so was compared to Angus Fraser and Glenn McGrath by many media pundits, although he also worried them by frequently falling <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> follow-through. Nevertheless, {{he went on to}} Old Trafford to take a second five-for, being named Player of the Series in his debutante international home season.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturing {{and retail}} {{remained}} Wilkes-Barre's strongest industries, but the city's economy took a major blow from Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972. The storm pushed the Susquehanna River to {{a height of}} nearly , four feet above the city's levees, flooding downtown with nine feet of water. A total of 128 deaths were attributed to the storm, the majority of drowning deaths were caused by people trapped in their cars; almost 400,000 homes and businesses were destroyed; 220,000 Pennsylvanians were left homeless (as were hundreds of thousands in other states). Damages were estimated to be $2.1 billion in Pennsylvania alone. President Richard Nixon sent aid to the area, after flying <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> helicopter {{on his way to}} his Camp David retreat (on June 24, 1972).|$|E
50|$|Greetham {{made his}} debut for the side during the 2001 38-County Cup, taking figures of 2-1 from 3.5 <b>overs</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{second of two}} matches in the competition.|$|R
50|$|Adcock bowled {{just ten}} <b>overs</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{first-class}} career, {{and the following}} year, played in the Minor Counties Championship for Lincolnshire. He {{died at the age}} of 88.|$|R
50|$|On 30 January, he took 4/50 {{from nine}} <b>overs</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> ODI debut against Australia. South Africa {{went on to}} win the match by 39 runs, and the ODI series by 4-1.|$|R
25|$|Illingworth played 787 {{first-class}} matches over nearly 33 years. As a bowler {{in county}} cricket, he took 2072 wickets. He sent down 408 balls without reward {{in the three}} Tests against New Zealand in 1973 but conceded only 1.91 runs an <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Test career. He was not a sharp spinner of the ball, relying on accuracy and subtle variations of flight, but his arm ball was particularly effective with many of his victims being caught at slip, playing for spin that was not there. His middle-order batting was based around stern defence; a fifth of his innings, mostly from number 6 or 7 in the order, finished not out. He scored 24,134 first-class runs in all, with a best of 162, {{at an average of}} 28.06. Against the Rest of the World in 1970, Illingworth topped the England averages with 476 runs (52.89) and six half-centuries, a testament to his grit and determination against the best in the world.|$|E
25|$|Stan {{returns home}} temporarily, but is sent into a hospice {{against his own}} will as his health {{continues}} to deteriorate. On Good Friday 2015, Dean returns to Albert Square alongside his father Buster Briggs (Karl Howman), insisting on visiting Stan at the hospital before he flees the country. Shirley calls the police to stop Dean leaving, and he is arrested for breaking his bail conditions, which saddens Stan. The following week, Stan attempts to bring his family together by asking Mick to make amends with Shirley, but although he tries, she refuses {{to show up at}} Stan and Cora's wedding ceremony. The ceremony is interrupted when Stan appears to be in pain, and the nurses give him pain relief. He promises Cora that they will marry the next day and she sleeps <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> room. Shirley also shows up there to be with {{him in the middle of}} the night, having had a change of heart after hearing of Jim Branning's (John Bardon) death. Stan's health rapidly deteriorates over the night, and the Carters and Cora keep a bedside vigil by his side. When Mick and Shirley argue, Stan advises them to make peace for his sake. Mick leaves while Shirley stays with Stan. Shirley reminisces the times she had with Mick when he was young. Stan hints to Shirley that she should put her family problems to rest, before dying peacefully.|$|E
25|$|England {{now had to}} win {{the final}} three Tests {{if they wanted to}} regain the Ashes, for which the only {{precedent}} was when Don Bradman made three big centuries in the 1936–37 Ashes series to win 3–2 after being 2–0 down to Gubby Allen's England side. Sydney is a famous spinning wicket, though the three tour matches the MCC had seen lots of runs for few wickets. In the New South Wales game immediately before the Third Test they had made 553/8 with Len Hutton making 150 and Reg Simpson 259 and the fast-medium bowler John Warr took 4/67. As a result the unhappy Brian Close was dropped in favour of Warr, making his debut, and England went into the Test with Doug Wright as the only specialist spinner, supported by the part-time spin of Freddie Brown and Denis Compton. The leg-spinner Eric Hollies had taken 5 wickets (78.60) in his three games at the Sydney Cricket Ground and off-spinner Bob Berry was going for 4 runs an <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> containment role and were not chosen. Denis Compton was fit again and replaced the ailing John Dewes, but Gilbert Parkhouse stayed in the team thanks to his fighting 28 at Melbourne and 92 against New South Wales. Australia kept the same team from the Second Test, though if they had lost the performances of a few of them would have resulted in their being dropped. For the only time in Lindsay Hassett's career as captain he lost the toss in an Ashes Test and Freddie Brown was able to bat first on another flat batting track.|$|E
50|$|At {{no point}} a {{frequent}} bowler within the team, Nilanjana bowled just nine <b>overs</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first-class career, which stretched to seven matches of the team's thirteen, {{none of which}} ended in victory.|$|R
50|$|Farrow {{made two}} List A {{appearances}} for the side, in the C&G Trophy in August and September 2002. As a tailender, {{he did not}} bat in either match, though he bowled five <b>overs</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> debut, and ten <b>in</b> <b>his</b> second match.|$|R
50|$|He was a {{strictly}} occasional bowler, sending down fewer than 35 <b>overs</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career and claiming just two first-class wickets. His victims were both substantial cricketers: Yorkshire's George Macaulay in 1926and Leicestershire's Alan Shipman in 1929.|$|R

Lincoln slumped <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair and then fell backward. Rathbone turned to see Booth standing in gunsmoke less than four feet behind Lincoln; Booth shouted a word that Rathbone thought sounded like [...] "Freedom!" ...|$|E
50|$|Hasan made five {{first-class}} appearances {{for four}} different teams between 1960 and 1970, including one {{appearance in the}} Quaid-e-Azam Trophy for Kalat. He made 69 runs and bowled 38 <b>overs</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first-class career, taking two wickets.|$|R
50|$|Sadhu's debut {{came for}} Bengal in 1939/40, playing against Bihar, against whom he helped {{his team to}} an innings victory. Sadhu's second and final {{first-class}} appearance followed nine seasons later, playing for Assam. He scored a duck <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first innings for the team and 11 runs in the second. Sadhu bowled 41 <b>overs</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first-class career.|$|R

500|$|Its {{development}} began {{during the}} early 1940s when, after two successive box-office hits, Vasan announced that his next film would be entitled Chandralekha. However, when the producer launched an advertising campaign for the film he only had {{the name of the}} heroine from a [...] Gemini Studios storyline he had rejected. Veppathur Kittoo (one of Vasan's storyboard artists) developed a story based on a chapter of George W. M. Reynolds' novel, Robert Macaire: or, The French bandit in England. Original director T. G.
