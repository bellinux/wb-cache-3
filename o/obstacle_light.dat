40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a technical and economic analysis of three stand-alone hybrid power systems based on renewable energy sources which supply a specific group of low-power consumers. This particular case includes measuring sensors and <b>obstacle</b> <b>lights</b> on a meteorological mast for wind measurements requiring an uninterrupted power supply in cold climate conditions. Although these low-power (100 W) measuring sensors and <b>obstacle</b> <b>lights</b> use little energy, their energy consumption {{is not the same as}} the available solar energy obtained on a daily or seasonal basis. In the paper, complementarity of renewable energy sources was analysed, as well as one of short-term lead-acid battery-based storage and seasonal, hydrogen-based (electrolyser, H 2 tank, and fuel cells) storage. These relatively complex power systems were proposed earlier for high-power consumers only, while this study specifically highlights the role of the hydrogen system for supplying low-power consumers. The analysis employed a numerical simulation method using the HOMER software tool. The results of the analysis suggest that solar and wind-solar systems, which involve meteorological conditions as referred to in this paper, include a relatively large number of lead-acid batteries. Additionally, the analysis suggests that the use of hydrogen power systems for supplying low power-consumers is entirely justifiable, as it significantly reduces the number of batteries (two at minimum in this particular case). It was shown that the increase in costs induced by the hydrogen system is acceptable. Key words: PV-wind-hydrogen hybrid system, PEM fuel cell, stand-alon...|$|R

Initially it was sudied and implemented a robot that explores an unknown path, using touch sensors and an obstacol detector to find its way during the exploration.

The light barriers under scrutiny throughout the current paper stand for walls of brick or concrete masonry units, reinforced concrete walls with thicknesses up to 12. 5 cm and metal doors. To create breaches, two different kinds of special explosive devices were used, according to the obstacle: cutting and pushing charges.

40|$|Abstract- Contour {{tracking}} is {{the process}} of removing own tracks, as you move through the landscape, it also includes laying down false tracks to deliberately mislead pursuers. Here we will track the path by maintaining a linear threshold level. If the obstacle is less than the threshold level then there is a path. If the obstacle is greater or equal to the threshold level it means there is an obstacle (vehicle can’t climb) and the vehicle will choose the alternate path. The obstacle can even mobile. The terrain will be analyzed using wavelet (decomposition) for better result. The contour provides us to differentiate harder <b>obstacles</b> and <b>lighter</b> <b>obstacles</b> more easily. This can be implemented in (all modes-air bone, earth, water) unmanned vehicles also at higher end which are our future work...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} how the direction of root growth changes in response to <b>obstacles,</b> <b>light,</b> and gravity, we characterized an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, wavy growth 2 (wav 2), whose roots show a short-pitch pattern of wavy growth on inclined agar medium. The roots of the wav 2 mutant bent with larger curvature {{than those of the}} wild-type seedlings in wavy growth and in gravitropic and phototropic responses. The cell file rotations of the root epidermis of wav 2 - 1 in the wavy growth pattern were enhanced in both right-handed and left-handed rotations. WAV 2 encodes a protein belonging to the BUD EMERGENCE 46 family with a transmembrane domain at the N terminus and an α/β-hydrolase domain at the C terminus. Expression analyses showed that mRNA of WAV 2 was expressed strongly in adult plant roots and seedlings, especially in the root tip, the cell elongation zone, and the stele. Our results suggest that WAV 2 is not involved in sensing environmental stimuli but that it negatively regulates stimulus-induced root bending through inhibition of root tip rotation...|$|R

One of Newton's arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known to bend around <b>obstacles,</b> while <b>light</b> travelled only in straight lines.

40|$|Wind {{turbines}} need obstacle warning aids to {{help the}} crew of airplanes, helicopters and ships to avoid collisions with the turbines. So far, the organizations performing the logistics of applying for building permits, site preparation and erection of wind turbines have generally handled each such activity as an isolated event. Thus, <b>obstacle</b> warning <b>lights</b> or markings have been applied as seen fit for the particular wind turbine or group of turbines. Obstacle markings have to be visible for aviators and seamen, this is obvious, but may be an annoyance to the public dwelling in the neighbourhood. This will put demands on the functioning and intensity of the system. For example: an unsynchronized blinking of light may have an adverse effect on the public acceptance of a wind farm. Two international organisations, ICAO 1 and IALA 2 work with recommendations for marking of wind turbines. ICAO {{is currently working on}} producing requirements specifically for marking and lighting wind turbines but have not yet completed these deliberations. The ICAO requirements for marking and <b>lighting</b> <b>obstacles</b> apply to all obstacles including wind turbines at present.
