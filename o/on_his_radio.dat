5|$|The ADL's National Director Abraham H. Foxman {{has accused}} him of anti-Semitism as has Rabbi Abraham Cooper, {{associate}} dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Waters stated that Cooper's accusation was bigoted. On 2 October 2015, Waters published an open letter in Salon criticising the band Bon Jovi for performing in Tel Aviv, which led Howard Stern to criticise Waters <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>radio</b> show. In June 2017 an organization known as We Don't Need No Roger Waters started to boycott Waters for his support of the BDS.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} being fired, Savage apologized <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>radio</b> program {{and on his}} website. He {{explained}} that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller {{and that he was}} off the air {{at the time of the}} offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Henry Townshend has been locked in his apartment in South Ashfield for five days with no means of communication and having recurring nightmares. Shortly afterwards, a hole appears in the wall of his bathroom, through which he enters alternate dimensions. His first destination is an abandoned subway station, where he meets Cynthia Velázquez, a woman convinced she is dreaming and who is soon killed by an unknown man. Awakening in his apartment, he hears confirmation <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>radio</b> that she is indeed dead in the real world. Similar events repeat with the next three people Henry finds: Jasper Gein; Andrew DeSalvo, a former employee of an orphanage run by Silent Hill's cult; and Richard Braintree, a resident in Henry's apartment complex. All the deaths bear similarities to the deceased serial killer Walter Sullivan's modus operandi.|$|E

5|$|While Scully {{consoles}} Patti, {{whose husband}} just died in Scully's arms, Doggett {{reports that he}} cannot find the Shadow Man's body. Scully, fearful {{that he is a}} Super Soldier pursuing Mulder, chases after the train with Doggett and Reyes. An employee who works for the train gets a call <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>radio,</b> saying that someone jumped off a train and into a rock quarry. Doggett and Reyes chase after someone they believe to be Mulder, while Scully goes deeper into the quarry. There, she is attacked by the Shadow Man. Suddenly, the Shadow Man is destroyed by the magnetite being mined from the quarry.|$|E
5|$|After {{a medical}} exam, Mulder {{finds out that}} Orison has three times the bloodflow {{capacity}} of the brain due to a hole in he has drilled into his own head, allowing him to perform mental tricks by hypnotizing people. Orison hypnotizes the security guard in his room and easily escapes. Meanwhile, at Orison's apartment, a prostitute escapes when Pfaster attacks her for wearing a wig. Orison then finds Pfaster and takes him at gunpoint. In the woods, Orison digs a grave for Pfaster, who morphs into a demonic beast and kills him, burying him in his own shallow grave. Pfaster then calls the police, telling them where Orison is buried, and goes to Scully's house. He attacks Scully, who tells him {{that the only reason}} he was not given the death penalty was because she asked the judge for life. He overpowers her and locks her in her own closet. Mulder thinks something may be wrong when he hears the same song <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>radio</b> and calls Scully. After receiving no answer, he goes over to her house and stumbles upon Pfaster, promptly arresting him. Meanwhile, Scully escapes from the closet and shoots Pfaster, despite him being unarmed, killing him. Scully later confides in Mulder, telling him she's scared because she's not sure who's in control of her, God or something else.|$|E

5|$|Di Grassi {{took over}} the lead with d'Ambrosio second; both drivers were half a lap ahead of the battling drivers, who had more {{available}} electrical energy. Félix da Costa and his teammate Frijns joined the leading group of drivers after being under the minimum pit stop time by three seconds. The safety was deployed for the third (and final) time when Duval stopped on track after leaving the chicane with a battery issue, prematurely ending his race. This allowed the field to close up to di Grassi and d'Ambrosio. The safety car drove into the pit lane on lap 30 and di Grassi held the lead at the restart. Vergne immediately pushed hard and attempted to pass López for third but the two drivers made contact at the turn three chicane. He attempted the same manoeuvre one lap later but López cut the chicane to avoid hitting Vergne and the latter demanded <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>radio</b> that López cede the position. Both Andretti cars were investigated because their pit stop times were faster the minimum permitted time of one minute because the team believed it was 57 seconds. López drew near to d'Ambrosio and Vergne remained close behind López. The battle allowed di Grassi {{to pull away from}} the field. Félix da Costa slowed and stopped his car on the 33rd lap with a broken driveshaft, causing him to retire. His teammate Frijns was issued with a drive-through penalty for being below the minimum pit stop time. Two laps later, López pushed hard and steered onto the outside line in an attempt to pass d'Ambrosio but spun under braking for the first corner, sliding off into the turn's run-off area. Buemi activated FanBoost and lined up an overtake on Rosenqvist (who locked his front tyres) but spun under braking for turn one, and narrowly avoided striking López's stranded car. Both drivers fell down the order. The electrical power in Engel's car depleted slowly after exiting turns five and six, ending his race. Buemi recorded the race's fastest lap on lap 40, completing a circuit at one minute and 3.102 seconds. This earned him one championship point. D'Ambrosio continued to hold back Vergne and the remaining seven cars behind him had more electrical energy available. D'Ambrosio locked his tyres under braking for the first corner, allowing Vergne to pass him for second place. Vergne then started to draw closer to di Grassi.|$|E
