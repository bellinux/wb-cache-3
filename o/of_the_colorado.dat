5|$|For a short stretch, the Colorado {{watershed}} {{meets the}} drainage basin of the Snake River, {{a tributary of}} the Columbia River, in the Wind River Range of western Wyoming.

To the west in California, the Colorado River watershed borders on those of small closed basins in the Mojave Desert, the largest of which is the Salton Sea drainage north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River Delta. On the south, the watersheds of the Sonoyta, Concepción, and Yaqui rivers, all of which drain to the Gulf of California, border that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado.</b>|$|E

5|$|On September30, 1935, the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) {{completed}} Hoover Dam in the Black Canyon <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River. Behind the dam rose Lake Mead, {{the largest}} artificial {{lake in the}} U.S., capable of holding {{more than two years}} of the Colorado's flow. The construction of Hoover was a major step towards stabilizing the lower channel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River, storing water for irrigation in times of drought, and providing much-needed flood control as part of a program known as the Boulder Canyon Project. Hoover was the tallest dam in the world at the time of construction and also had the world's largest hydroelectric power plant. Flow regulation from Hoover Dam opened the doors for rapid development on the lower Colorado River; Imperial and Parker dams followed in 1938, and Davis Dam was completed in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Other {{formations}} {{were also}} formed but were mostly eroded following uplift from the Laramide orogeny which started around 70million years ago (mya). This event created the Rocky Mountains {{far to the}} east and helped to close the sea that covered the area. A large part of western North America started to stretch itself into the nearby Basin and Range topography around 15mya. While not part of this region, the greater Bryce area was stretched into the High Plateaus by the same forces. Uplift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> Plateaus and the opening of the Gulf of California by 5mya changed the drainage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River and its tributaries, including the Paria River, which is eroding headward in between two plateaus adjacent to the park. The uplift caused the formation of vertical joints which were later preferentially eroded to form the free-standing pinnacles called hoodoos, badlands, and monoliths we see today.|$|E
5|$|Presently {{the only}} major streams {{entering}} the basin come from mountains {{to the west and}} northwest, but during the Pleistocene they likely transported more water. When lower sea levels entrenched a more southerly course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River, Lake Cahuilla may have been nourished solely by local runoff during the Wisconsin glaciation.|$|E

5|$|Some anomalously old {{radiocarbon}} {{dates of}} Lake Cahuilla deposits {{may be the}} consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River transporting ancient carbonates into the lake.
