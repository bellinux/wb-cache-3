40|$|This paper {{presents}} the three-dimensional temperature measurement of an <b>oxy-gas</b> <b>burner</b> flame based on optical tomographic and two-color techniques. Eight two-dimensional (2 -D) image {{projections of the}} flame are obtained concurrently by multiple imaging fiber bundles and imaging sensors. The LFBP (Logical Filtered Back-Projection) algorithm combined the SART (Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique) is utilized to reconstruct the gray-level intensity of the flame based on its 2 -D images. The flame temperature distribution is then determined using the reconstructed gray-levels through the two-color pyrometry. Experiments were undertaken under different oxy-fuel conditions. The {{results show that the}} flame temperature increases with the O 2 concentration and that the temperature distribution of the oxy-fuel flame is more uniform at the root region than that at other regions...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the production of metal-coated optical fibres, the fibres being drawn within a vacuum. Most common methods for producing optical fibres employ an <b>oxy-gas</b> ring <b>burner</b> or an inert gas resistance furnace to reach the high temperatures necessary to melt silica. These methods have the disadvantage of exposing the molten or hot silica fibre to the atmosphere before a protective coating is applied, thereby increasing the possibility of contaminants being present at the fibre surface. A novel though more elaborate method of producing fibres is described, with preliminary experimental results. Vacuum production allows the fibre to be metal-coated, using a magnetron sputtering technique, before exposure to the atmosphere, and the methods by which this is achieved are described. An electromagnetically operated optical fibre switch utilising a ferromagnetically-coated optical fibre is also described. </p...|$|R
40|$|Flame {{reactors}} {{are considered}} {{to be one of the}} most promising and versatile synthesis routes for the largescale production of submicron and nanosized particles. An annular co-flow type <b>oxy-gas</b> diffusion <b>burner</b> was designed for its application in a modular flame reactor for the synthesis of nanocrystalline oxide ceramics. The burner consisted of multiple ports for the individually regulated flow of a precursor vapour, inert gas, fuel gas and oxidizer. The nanopowders formed during flame synthesis in the reaction chamber were collected by a suitable set of filters. In the present study, TTIP was used as the precursor for the synthesis of nanocrystalline TiO 2 and helium was used to carry the precursor vapour to the burner head. Methane and oxygen were used as fuel and oxidizer respectively. The operating conditions were varied by systematically changing the flow rates of the gases involved. The synthesized powders were characterized using standard techniques such as XRD, SEM, TEM, BET etc., in order to determine the crystallite size, phase content, morphology, particle size and degree of agglomeration. The influences of gas flow rates on the powder characteristics are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The current {{trend in}} the steel {{industry}} is a gradual decline in conventional steelmaking from taconite pellets in blast furnaces, and {{an increasing number of}} alternative processes using metallic scrap iron, pig iron and metallized iron ore products. Currently, iron ores from Minnesota and Michigan are pelletized and shipped to the lower Great Lakes ports as blast furnace feed. The existing transportation system and infrastructure is geared to handling these bulk materials. In order to expand the opportunities for the existing iron ore mines beyond their blast furnace customer base, a new material is needed to satisfy the needs of the emerging steel industry while utilizing the existing infrastructure and materials handling. A recent commercial installation employing Kobe Steel’s ITmk 3 process, was installed in Northeastern Minnesota. The basic process uses a moving hearth furnace to directly reduce iron oxides to metallic iron from a mixture of iron ore, coals and additives. The resulting products can be shipped using the existing infrastructure for use in various steelmaking processes. The technology reportedly saves energy by 30 % over the current integrated steelmaking process and reduces emissions by more than 40 %. A similar large-scale pilot plant campaign is also currently in progress using JFE Steel’s Hi-QIP process in Japan. The objective of this proposal is to build upon and improve the technology demonstrated by Kobe Steel and JFE, by further reducing cost, improving quality and creating added incentive for commercial development. This project expands previous research conducted at the University of Minnesota Duluth’s Natural Resources Research Institute and that reported by Kobe and JFE Steel. Three major issues have been identified and are addressed in this project for producing high-quality nodular reduced iron (NRI) at low cost: (1) reduce the processing temperature, (2) control the furnace gas atmosphere over the NRI, and (3) effectively use sub-bituminous coal as a reductant. From over 4000 laboratory tube and box furnace tests, it was established that the correct combination of additives, fluxes, and reductant while controlling the concentration of CO and CO 2 in the furnace atmosphere (a) lowers the operating temperature, (b) decreases the use of reductant coal (c) generates less micro nodules of iron, and (d) promotes desulphurization. The laboratory scale work was subsequently verified on 12. 2 m (40 ft) long pilot scale furnace. High quality NRI could be produced on a routine basis using the pilot furnace facility with energy provided from <b>oxy-gas</b> or oxy-coal <b>burner</b> technologies. Specific strategies were developed to allow the use of sub-bituminous coals both as a hearth material and as part of the reaction mixture. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling was used to study the overall carbothermic reduction and smelting process. The movement of the furnace gas on a pilot hearth furnace and larger simulated furnaces and various means of controlling the gas atmosphere were evaluated. Various atmosphere control methods were identified and tested {{during the course of the}} investigation. Based on the results, the appropriate modifications to the furnace were made and tested at the pilot scale. A series of reduction and smelting tests were conducted to verify the utility of the processing conditions. During this phase, the overall energy use characteristics, raw materials, alternative fuels, and the overall economics predicted for full scale implementation were analyzed. The results indicate that it should be possible to lower reaction temperatures while simultaneously producing low sulfur, high carbon NRI if the right mix chemistry and atmosphere are employed. Recommendations for moving the technology to the next stage of commercialization are presented...|$|R
