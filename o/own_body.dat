5|$|Generally the {{jumping spider}} {{subfamily}} Spartaeinae, {{which includes the}} genus Portia, cannot discriminate objects at such long distances as the members of subfamilies Salticinae or Lyssomaninae can. However, members of Portia have vision about as acute as {{the best of the}} jumping spiders, for example: the salticine Mogrus neglectus can distinguish prey and conspecifics up to 320millimetres away (42times its <b>own</b> <b>body</b> length), while P. fimbriata can distinguish these up to 280millimetres (47times its <b>own</b> <b>body</b> length). The main eyes of a Portia can also identify features of the scenery up to 85times its <b>own</b> <b>body</b> length, which helps the spider to find detours.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{abortion}} is discussed {{with reference to the}} claim that people have a right of control over their <b>own</b> <b>bodies.</b> Do people "own" their <b>own</b> <b>bodies?</b> If so, what would be entailed? These questions are discussed in commonsense terms and also in relation to the jurisprudence of Hohfeld, Honore, Munzer and Waldron. It is argued that whether or not women are morally and/or should be legally entitled to have abortions, such entitlements cannot be derived from a general moral entitlement to do what we will with our <b>own</b> <b>bodies</b> since there is no such entitlement. Whether or not we "own" them, we can have rights duties, liabilities, restrictions and disadvantages as well as rights concerning our <b>own</b> <b>bodies...</b>|$|R

It {{was less than a}} foot from the two Marines with PFC Gonsalves. Without a moment's hesitation, he flung himself on the grenade, taking the full explosion into his <b>own</b> <b>body.</b> He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even touched by grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E
5|$|At Mulder's apartment, Scully {{announces that}} because of Mulder's odd behavior, she {{realized}} Mulder's body contains Morris Fletcher. Scully demands {{to know how to}} restore Mulder to his <b>own</b> <b>body.</b> Mulder's informant calls again and Scully forces Fletcher to take the call and set up a meeting. Mulder, Joanne, Fletcher and Scully arrive at a bar in Rachel, Nevada, where Mulder's informant is revealed to be General Wegman. Wegman admits that he sabotaged the UFO, but maintains that he only tried to merely disable the stealth module so that Mulder could see it. Wegman gives Fletcher, who he thinks is Mulder, the proof of the encounter, a flight data recorder in a paper bag. Meanwhile, Mulder leaves and talks to Scully in the car. Later, Mulder and Fletcher meet in the bar's bathroom and argue about the flight data recorder. As they argue, General Wegman enters the bathroom and discovers the two. Mulder meets with General Wegman to discuss the UFO. Wegman believes that now that Fletcher knows Wegman's identity, when restored to his <b>own</b> <b>body,</b> Fletcher will turn him in. Wegman explains that he hoped that Mulder could explain whether aliens actually exist; apparently the craft are simply given to the military without knowing where they are from or how they work.|$|E

Leaving of the chamber would have signified an end to the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion, meaning the acceptance of foreign territorial demands.|$|E
5|$|On September 14, 1951, PFC Edward Gomez (1932–1951), an Ammunition Bearer in Company E, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division, voluntarily {{moved down}} an {{abandoned}} trench {{to search for}} a new location for his machine gun and, when a hostile grenade landed between himself and his weapon, he shouted a warning to those around him as he grasped the activated charge in his hand. Determined to save his comrades, he unhesitatingly chose to sacrifice himself and, diving into a ditch with the deadly missile, absorbed the violence of the explosion in his <b>own</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the anime's plot follows that of the manga, but the plots {{severely}} diverge from each other near the middle of the story. After Kimblee uses alchemy to transform Al's armor into explosive material, Scar transfers all of his incomplete Philosopher's Stone into Al to save his life. As a result, Alphonse's armor becomes the Philosopher's Stone. Because he houses the Stone in his body, he becomes the primary target of the homunculi's leader Dante, who is trying to cheat death. Once captured by the homunculi for Dante, Al is to be eaten by Gluttony to complete the Stone inside Gluttony's body. But when he sees his brother killed trying to save him, Al uses the stone's power to heal Edward's body and re-bind his soul to it. This destroys Al's <b>own</b> <b>body</b> as he uses up the whole of the Philosopher's Stone in the transmutations. Then Edward, using his <b>own</b> <b>body,</b> resurrects Alphonse. As a result, Edward disappears and Alphonse continues studying alchemy to find him.|$|E

To open hard shells, it may pound its prey with both paws against a rock on its chest. To pry an abalone off its rock, it hammers the abalone shell using a large stone, with {{observed}} rates of 45 blows in 15 seconds. Releasing an abalone, which can cling to rock with a force equal to 4,000 times its <b>own</b> <b>body</b> weight, requires multiple dives.|$|E
5|$|Akane {{explains}} that Sigma, after his abduction in 2028, had his consciousness transported into his elder self's body in 2074, while his elder self's consciousness was transported into the younger Sigma's body in 2028. The {{goal of the}} AB project was to enable the elder Sigma to prevent the Radical-6 outbreak in 2028 with his future knowledge; Dio sought to stop the project. Akane makes Phi and Sigma's consciousnesses jump to 2029, after the outbreak. Sigma, as Zero Sr., spends the next 45 years developing the AB project together with Akane, while Phi is kept in cold sleep. Sigma creates Kyle as a spare, in case his <b>own</b> <b>body</b> gets damaged. When they again arrive at 2074, Sigma and Phi jump back to 2028 to infiltrate the Mars mission test site.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 5 of the Varaha Upanishad is {{dedicated}} to Yoga, as a discussion between Ribhu and his student Nidagha. There are three types of Yoga, states the text, and these are Laya (soft), Mantra (mystic), and Hatha (middle), recommending Hatha Yoga as foremost of three. It discusses various aspects of Yoga, ranging from recommending that healthy food should be eaten in temperate quantities, in small portions, several times a day, to recommending that Yoga should not be performed when one is not feeling well or is very hungry. The goal of Yoga, states Varaha, is manifold, including the gain of body strength and suppleness, acquisition of knowledge of one's <b>own</b> <b>body</b> and its auras, meditation, and Self (soul) knowledge.|$|E

5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her <b>own</b> <b>body.</b> Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E

She is also considered a fashion and art trendsetter, {{and for a long time}} she was associated with Madonna. In 2001, she had her first retrospective and in 2005, she published her first book on body painting. At the peak of her pop culture fame after the Vanity Fair cover, she was seriously considered for an Absolut Vodka Absolute Gair ad campaign. She has done magazine editorial work, and in 2005, she became a photographer of her <b>own</b> <b>body</b> paintings in both books and magazines.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Doctor {{arrives at}} da Vinci's home but is {{captured}} by Captain Tancredi, who appears identical to Count Scarlioni. Tancredi reveals {{he is really}} Scaroth, {{a member of the}} Jagaroth race. They had arrived on Earth 400 million years ago, but due an explosion in their craft, all of the others died and his <b>own</b> <b>body</b> was fragmented across time. Collectively, the fragments of Scaroth have manipulated humanity so that by the 20th century, they will have technology that will enable him to go back in time to stop the explosion. Tancredi is currently employing da Vinci to create copies of the Mona Lisa as to finance Scarlioni's work. After Tancredi leaves, the Doctor knocks out his captor, marks the blank canvases with a felt-tip pen, and leaves a message to da Vinci to paint over his writing before returning to the present.|$|E

Under Fuhito's control, {{the remainder of}} AVALANCHE is turned into a vicious army of uncontrollable Ravens, and he manages to steal all the materia needed. In the final battle, Fuhito summons Zirconiade, fusing the summon with his <b>own</b> <b>body,</b> and Shears sacrifices himself to save Elfé. Fuhito transforms into a monster, but he is defeated by the Turks. After the battle, Tseng falsely claims that both Veld and Elfé are dead, so as {{to protect them from}} being hunted by Shinra. The Turks are then reorganized, with Tseng reinstated as their immediate leader, but they are now sworn to loyalty to Shinra as part of the bargain for their survival. The original Turks find new lives for themselves in hiding, and are later seen helping in the evacuation of Midgar during the events of VII.|$|E
5|$|Net-casting spiders weave {{only small}} webs, but then {{manipulate}} them to trap prey. Those {{of the genus}} Hyptiotes and the family Theridiosomatidae stretch their webs and then release them when prey strike them, but do not actively move their webs. Those of the family Deinopidae weave even smaller webs, hold them outstretched between their first two pairs of legs, and lunge and push the webs as much as twice their <b>own</b> <b>body</b> length to trap prey, and this move may increase the webs' area {{by a factor of}} up to ten. Experiments have shown that Deinopis spinosus has two different techniques for trapping prey: backwards strikes to catch flying insects, whose vibrations it detects; and forward strikes to catch ground-walking prey that it sees. These two techniques have also been observed in other deinopids. Walking insects form most of the prey of most deinopids, but one population of Deinopis subrufa appears to live mainly on tipulid flies that they catch with the backwards strike.|$|E
5|$|Sphecius grandis {{has very}} similar nesting and feeding habits to {{other members of}} its genus, most notably Sphecius speciosus. As with S.speciosus, the female hunts for cicadas in low tree trunks, helped by the calls of the cicada males, and paralyses the insect by {{piercing}} {{the central nervous system}} with her stinger. She drags the cicadas back to her nest to place them in brood cells in which she eventually lays one egg per cell. Females carry cicadas that are on average 88% heavier than their <b>own</b> <b>body</b> mass. It has been hypothesised that cicada killers may also have the ability to capture cicadas mid-flight. There are approximately two or more cicadas to each brood cell. When the larvae hatch, the cicada provides nutrition for the offspring to feed on.|$|E
