5|$|Body piercing, {{a form of}} body modification, is the {{practice}} of puncturing <b>or</b> <b>cutting</b> {{a part of the}} human body, creating an opening in which jewelry may be worn. The word piercing can refer to the act or practice of body piercing, or to an opening in the body created by this act or practice. Although the history of body piercing is obscured by popular misinformation and by a lack of scholarly reference, ample evidence exists to document that it has been practiced in various forms by both sexes since ancient times throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other Portia species, P. fimbriata in Queensland readily invades {{the nests}} of cursorial spiders, {{plucking}} <b>or</b> <b>cutting</b> the nest. If the resident spider eventually leaves the nest, P. fimbriata stalks it. If the resident spider tries to counterattack and then retreats into the nest, P. fimbriata may attack the other spider as it re-enters the nest, or may wait motionless until the prey exits. If a stabbed prey spider retreats into the nest, P. fimbriata in Queensland never enters the nest, but {{waits for the}} prey to move out, and then P. fimbriata kills it.|$|E
5|$|Also {{found on}} {{calcareous}} (chalky) soils, Rubroboletus satanas is larger {{and has a}} pale cap, and its upper stem lacks the reticulations characteristic of S.luridus. Its flesh does not turn blue so markedly on bruising <b>or</b> <b>cutting.</b> It has a more globular overall shape, and young mushrooms carry a smell of decay. The edible Neoboletus luridiformis can be distinguished from S.luridus by its dark brown cap; it also grows on sandy soils associated with conifers. In North America, it can {{be confused with the}} poisonous Rubroboletus pulcherrimus, which has a fatter stalk and deeper red pores. Initially collected in Michigan under oak, Boletus vinaceobasis resembles S.luridus but has shorter spores and its cystidia are dark brown in Melzer's reagent. Boletus species that share a similar appearance with S.luridus but lack reticulation in their stems include B.subvelutipes (found in North America and Asia) and B.hypocarycinus (United States).|$|E

5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing <b>or</b> <b>cutting</b> the skin {{with a sharp}} object. However, the number of self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, hair pulling, bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to anorexia and bulimia. The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, it may be more accurate to define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.|$|E

25|$|As {{another form}} of abatement, some coats of arms were {{reportedly}} modified through breaking <b>or</b> <b>cutting,</b> reversing, or altogether erasing some existing charges, at least as they occur in patents, though the armiger's actual display of these defaced arms has not been documented and is unlikely.|$|E
25|$|The only {{practicable}} {{line of ascent}} for walkers is {{along the}} ridge, either from the end at Deepdale Bridge, <b>or</b> <b>cutting</b> up the southern side from Cow Bridge and Brothers Water.

25|$|Shaving {{the head}} <b>or</b> <b>cutting</b> the hair {{extremely}} short {{can be used}} to control lice infestation. Short hair, baldness, or a shaven scalp are generally seen as a preventive measure against louse infestation. This will also eliminate– particularly if maintained for the length of the parasites' reproductive cycle– louse infestation.|$|E

Three quarters of health quangos have already been axed, and plans have been announced to scrap Strategic Health Authorities.|$|E
25|$|The radula {{is used by}} {{molluscs}} {{for feeding}} and is sometimes compared rather inaccurately to a tongue. It is a minutely toothed, chitinous ribbon, typically used for scraping <b>or</b> <b>cutting</b> food before the food enters the oesophagus. The radula is unique to molluscs, and is found in every class of mollusc apart from bivalves.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not only}} that catches were missed. The picking up was slovenly and the returns to the wicket badly directed. There was no {{anticipation}} <b>or</b> <b>cutting</b> off of runs by {{the men in the}} deep, and quite often Brown had to halt a bowler in his run-up to direct a fieldsmen to his proper position.|$|E
25|$|RHR {{opposes the}} {{construction}} of the Israeli West Bank barrier in any place where it entails the expropriation of Arab-owned land, the division of villages, <b>or</b> <b>cutting</b> farmers off from their fields.

25|$|Starting in Season 6, 4Kids dropped One Piece and {{the rights}} were picked up by FUNimation. The episode numbers and titles were {{restored}} to their original Japanese with slight differences in situations where 4Kids terms (from the TV series and video games) were kept for the TV broadcast. FUNimation did not continue the practice of combining <b>or</b> <b>cutting</b> episodes, though some edits to the content started by 4Kids were still kept.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{the purpose}} of {{altering}} {{the state of the}} ball is to achieve more favourable bowling conditions. Examples of ball tampering would include a fielder applying a substance, such as lip balm or sweetened saliva, to shine one side of the ball or pick the seam of the ball to encourage more swing. Conversely, roughening one side of the ball by use of an abrasive <b>or</b> <b>cutting</b> surface (such as boot spikes or bottle caps) is also ball tampering.|$|E
25|$|Iaido is {{associated}} with the smooth, controlled movements of drawing the sword from its scabbard (or saya), striking <b>or</b> <b>cutting</b> an opponent, removing blood from the blade, and then replacing the sword in the scabbard. While beginning practitioners of iaido may start learning with a wooden sword (bokken) depending on the teaching style of a particular instructor, most of the practitioners use the blunt edged sword, called iaitō. Few, more experienced, iaido practitioners use a sharp edged sword (shinken).|$|E
