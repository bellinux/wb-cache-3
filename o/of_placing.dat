40|$|This paper {{explores the}} notion <b>of</b> <b>place</b> in {{relation}} to networked mobility and mobile phone use. Two key arguments are developed. The first is that the experience <b>of</b> <b>place</b> persists and remains an important consideration {{in relation to}} mobile phone use. The ‘domestication’ approach to understanding the development and uses of new technologies is considered useful in explaining this persistence. The second is that networked mobility actually forces a renegotiation <b>of</b> <b>place,</b> and leads to significantly altered understandings <b>of</b> <b>place</b> and place-making. This is theorised as a shift from a traditional understanding <b>of</b> <b>place</b> as stable and fixed (stabilitas loci), to a reconceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>place</b> as experienced in and understood through mobility (mobilitas loci). The paper concludes by sketching some of the potential, and possible implications, that this renewed understanding <b>of</b> <b>place</b> might have for future studies of networked mobility...|$|R

However, the NDH regime had not made any arrangements to implement this idea, so {{the establishment of a}} children's camp was done in haste, especially as there was strong pressure to do something for the children.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} meaning <b>of</b> <b>place</b> {{attachment}} and its connection to location and locale {{in the context}} of the urban neighbourhood. The concept <b>of</b> <b>place</b> is conceptualised in terms of the setting in which social relations are constituted, the effects upon locales of social and economic processes and the creation of a sense <b>of</b> <b>place,</b> defined as the local ‘structure of feeling’ (Williams 1977). Drawing on data gathered from residents in marginalised neighbourhoods across six European cities, the paper explicates the meaning <b>of</b> <b>place</b> in the everyday life <b>of</b> the community. <b>Place</b> is frequently construed through a repository of shared memories and traditions. A sense <b>of</b> <b>place</b> rooted in the past is deployed as a resource to mobilise around the challenges of the present. Feelings <b>of</b> <b>place</b> attachment resonate as a significant marker of identity and community even as sense <b>of</b> <b>place</b> is challenged by the developments in modern city places...|$|R

40|$|SEMANTIC STRUCTURE OF STANDARD LATVIAN ADVERBS <b>OF</b> <b>PLACE</b> Summary This is a {{description}} of the semantic structure of standard Latvian adverbs <b>of</b> <b>place.</b> It starts with a paradigmatic analysis (first, a reference is made to determinations of the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>place,</b> which are provided by Latviešu literārās valodas vārdnīca; then an orientation meaning is defined, followed by marking of the integral and differential features, and determination of semantic oppositions), later followed by a syntagmatic analysis. In analyzing the structure of the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>place</b> within the syntagmatic approach, it is necessary to consider a context and a situation. Analysis of paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations underlie the classification of the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>place.</b> On the basis of this classification, differential features that are the least significant elements are being identified. 24 pairs of differential features can be used to describe the semantic structure of the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>place.</b> When the system of paradigmatic relations of all the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>place</b> is fully described, it is possible to characterize every single adverb <b>of</b> <b>place</b> as a particular combination of these features, and to set its place in this system. For instance, the adverb <b>of</b> <b>place</b> klāt can be characterized as [non-interrogative – non-cognitive – non-deictic – non-vertical – non-inside – side – non-concrete], etc. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{academic}} study <b>of</b> <b>place</b> {{has been}} generally defined by two distinct and highly refined discourses within outdoor recreation research: place attachment and sense <b>of</b> <b>place.</b> Place attachment generally describes the intensity <b>of</b> the <b>place</b> relationship, whereas sense <b>of</b> <b>place</b> approaches place {{from a more}} holistic and intimate orientation. This study bridges these two methodological and theoretical separate areas <b>of</b> <b>place</b> research together by re-conceptualizing {{the way in which}} place relationships are viewed within outdoor recreation research. The Psychological Continuum Model is used to extend the language <b>of</b> <b>place</b> attachment to incorporate more of the philosophy <b>of</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>place</b> while attending to the empirical strength and utility <b>of</b> <b>place</b> attachment. This extension results in the term place allegiance being coined to depict the strong and profound relationships outdoor recreationists build with their <b>places</b> <b>of</b> outdoor recreation. Using a concurrent mixed methods research design, this study explored place allegiance via an online survey (n = 437) and thirteen in-depth qualitative interviews with outdoor recreationists. Results indicate that place allegiance can be measured through a multi-dimensional model <b>of</b> <b>place</b> allegiance that incorporates behaviours, importance, resistance, knowledge and symbolic value. In addition, place allegiance was found to be related to an individual's influence on life course and his/her willingness to exhibit preservation and protection tendencies. Place allegiance {{plays an important role in}} acknowledging the importance <b>of</b> authentic <b>place</b> relationships in an effort to confront placelessness.
