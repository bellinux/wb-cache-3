40|$|Background. Tannery {{workers are}} at {{considerable}} risk of developing <b>occupational</b> contact <b>dermatitis.</b> <b>Occupational</b> skin diseases in tannery workers in newly industrialized countries have been reported, but neither the prevalence of <b>occupational</b> allergic contact <b>dermatitis</b> nor the skin-sensitizing agents were specifically examined in those studies. Objectives. To assess the prevalence of <b>occupational</b> allergic contact <b>dermatitis</b> in Indonesian tanneries, identify the causative allergens, and propose a tannery work series of patch test allergens. Patients/methods A cross-sectional study in all workers at two Indonesian tanneries was performed to assess the prevalence of <b>occupational</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> via a questionnaire-based interview and skin examination. Workers with <b>occupational</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> were patch tested to identify the causative allergens. Results. <b>Occupational</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> was suspected in 77 (16 %) of the 472 workers. Thirteen (3 %) of these 472 workers were confirmed to have <b>occupational</b> allergic contact <b>dermatitis.</b> Potassium dichromate (9. 2 %), N,N-diphenylguanidine (5. 3 %), benzidine (3. 9 %) and sodium metabisulfite (2. 6 %) {{were found to be}} the occupationally relevant sensitizers. Conclusions. The sensitization pattern showed some differences from the data in studies reported from other newly industrial countries. We compiled a tannery work series' of allergens for patch testing. A number of these allergens may also be considered for patch testing in patients with (leather) shoe dermatitis...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Occupational</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{occupational}} diseases in Europe. In order to develop effective preventive measures, detailed and up-to-date data on the incidence, main causes and professions at risk of <b>occupational</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> are needed. OBJECTIVES: To describe the pattern of patch test reactivity to allergens in the European baseline series of patients with <b>occupational</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> in different occupations. METHODS: We analysed data collected by the European Surveillance System on Contact Allergy (ESSCA) network from 2002 to 2010, from 11 European countries. RESULTS: Allergens in the European baseline series associated with an at least doubled risk of <b>occupational</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> include: thiuram rubber chemical accelerators, epoxy resin, and the antimicrobials methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone, methyldibromo glutaronitrile, and formaldehyde. The highest risk of <b>occupational</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> was found in occupations classified as 'other personal services workers', which includes hairdressers, nursing and other healthcare professionals, precision workers in metal and related materials, and blacksmiths, tool-makers and related trades workers. CONCLUSIONS: In the planning and implementation of measures aimed at preventing <b>occupational</b> contact <b>dermatitis,</b> the focus should be on the identified high-risk occupational groups and the most common occupational allergies...|$|R

50|$|A {{barrier cream}} is a topical {{formulation}} used in industrial applications {{and as a}} cosmetic to place a physical barrier between the skin and contaminants that may irritate the skin (contact dermatitis or <b>occupational</b> <b>dermatitis).</b> There are many other terms for creams designed to protect skin from harmful substances, including skin protective creams, pre-work creams, antisolvent gels, protective ointments, and shielding lotions. Three classes of barrier creams are used: water repellent creams, water-soluble creams, and creams designed for special applications.

40|$|<b>Occupational</b> <b>dermatitis</b> {{is among}} the most {{frequent}} occupational diseases. Dermal exposure risk affects many professional categories such as healthcare workers, hairdressers, bakers, cleaning and kitchen employees. The economical burden of <b>occupational</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (OD) is huge (greater than 5 billion Euro per year in Europe), comprising direct costs (treatment, compensation), as well as indirect costs due to sick leave and lack of productivity. A scientifically based preventive program consisting of skin protection during work, cleaning and skin care after work has generally been recommended to prevent occupational contact dermatitis. However the rate of reported occupational skin diseases seems unchanged in the recent years. In cases of impaired skin condition the secondary prevention (i. e. therapeutic treatment by dermatologists and health-educational intervention seminars) is fundamental. For cases of occupational dermatoses in which these outpatient prevention measures are not successful, interdisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation measures have been developed (tertiary individual prevention). In the past years, various pilot-concepts to improve <b>occupational</b> <b>dermatitis</b> prevention have been successfully put into practice focussing on interdisciplinary (dermatological and educational) skin protection training programmes for high-risk professions. Currently a multi-step intervention approach is implemented which is aiming at offering quick preventive help at all levels of severity of occupational contact dermatitis. Recent data reveals that there are reliable evidence-based options for multidisciplinary prevention and patient management of <b>occupational</b> <b>dermatitis</b> using a combined approach by a network of clinics, practices and statutory social insurance bodies. At this stage, it seemed reasonable to form a European joint initiative for skin prevention.

40|$|<b>Occupational</b> contact <b>{{dermatitis}}</b> is a dermatitis {{that occurs}} due to {{contact with the}} materials {{that exist in the}} workplace, and {{this is not the case}} if the person does not work. In the textile workers, the incidence of <b>occupational</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> ranks fourth of all occupational skin diseases annually in Finland. Contact dermatitis is of two kinds, namely contact dermatitis (DKI) arising through non-immunologic mechanisms and allergic contact dermatitis (DKA) as a result of specific immunologic mechanism (slow type hypersensitivity reaction (type IV)). To assign a material cause of contact dermatitis required a careful history taking about, a complete medical history, physical examination and patch test and is also required investigation into the workplace to observe the work and what materials are usually in contact with the patient when the patient works.

40|$|Fruit-derived organic {{compounds}} and detergents are relevant exposure factors for <b>occupational</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> {{in the food}} industry. Although individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD) {{are at risk for}} development of <b>occupational</b> contact <b>dermatitis,</b> there have been no controlled studies on the effects of repeated exposure to multiple irritants, relevant for the food industry, in atopic skin. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the outcomes of repeated exposure to a fruit-derived organic acid and a detergent in AD compared to healthy volunteers. The volunteers were exposed to 2. 0 % acetic acid (AcA) and/or 0. 5 % sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) in controlled tandem repeated irritation test. The outcomes were assessed by measurements of erythema, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and natural moisturizing factor (NMF) levels. In the AD volunteers, repeated AcA exposure led to barrier disruption and significant TEWL increase; no significant differences after the same exposure in the healthy controls were found. Repeated exposure to SLS and the irritant tandems enhanced the reactions and resulted in a significantly higher increase in TEWL in the AD compared to the control group. Cumulative irritant exposure reduced the NMF levels in both groups.
