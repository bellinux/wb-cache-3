40|$|Managing the {{operation}} of large commercial spent nuclear fuel reprocessing plants, such as UP 3 and UP 2 - 800 in La Hague, France, requires an extensive analytical program and the shortest possible analysis response times. COGEMA, together with its engineering subsidiary SGN, decided to build high-performance laboratories to support operations in its plants. These laboratories feature automated equipment, safe environments for operators, and short response times, all in centralized installations. Implementation of a computerized analytical data management system and a fully automated pneumatic system for the transfer of radioactive samples was a key factor contributing to the successful <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratories</b> and plants...|$|E
40|$|Euratom {{safeguards}} was {{the first}} international safeguards organisation having to cope with nuclear material safeguards in huge industrial scale reprocessing facilities. The four plants in the UK (Magnox, Thorp) and France (UP 2, UP 3) were built in two sites. Thorough analysis concluded that sampling is needed; the transport of the samples to a central Euratom laboratory should be avoided. It was decided to establish laboratories {{on the site of}} Sellafield and La Hague. These laboratories were opened about ten years ago and have been working continuously. They are staffed by experts of the Institute for Transuranium Elements, JRC-ITU, at Karlsruhe. ITU staff is present on-site for more than 40 weeks per year, ensuring a continuous flow of samples and of results. The laboratories receive samples from all the plants on the respective sites, with input solution, plutonium products (including mixed oxides) and inventory samples being the most important type of material. The criteria for selection of the measurement methods for these samples are based on a combination of highest possible accuracy and a minimum of resource consumption. The data can be used for direct comparison with the operator¿s results and they allow an evaluation of the material flows and material balance in a timely manner. The paper will give an overview of 10 years of <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratories.</b> Emphasis will be on analytical techniques, measurement uncertainties, and on the renovation of measurement equipment, which is becoming a serious issue after ten years of operation. The first major equipment replacement carried out now is the exchange of a mass spectrometer at the Sellafield laboratory. The safeguards impact will be discussed, and the lessons learned and the way forward will be presented. JRC. E. 7 -Nuclear Safeguards and Forensic...|$|E

Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> non-English-speaking immigrants {{who have come to}} the United States to live and study, enrollment in English as a second language (ESL) programs has increased greatly.

Working in <b>the</b> Meats <b>Laboratory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Animal Science helped finance his undergraduate education. He describes <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> agricultural courses when all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings except Plumb Hall were east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river. 	The changes made in <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Meats <b>Laboratory</b> are described. World War II interrupted his graduate education. He summarizes his activities as a new assistant professor. During his tenure, <b>the</b> percentage <b>of</b> women in <b>the</b> meats programs increased. During <b>the</b> riots <b>of</b> 1970, a major concern was <b>the</b> protection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barns. His involvement with the Speaker’s Rule is summarized. 	During his career, agricultural research increased on the OSU campus. <b>The</b> evaluation <b>of</b> faculty stressed <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> research projects. <b>The</b> differences in administrative procedures of deans are discussed.

40|$|As a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> routine <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jet Propulsion <b>Laboratory</b> {{atmospheric}} measurements {{program at}} the Table Mountain Facility, the surface ozone concentration is continuously monitored using a Dasibi photometer. <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Los Angeles basin to <b>the</b> southwest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facility and <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inversion layer cause large fluctuations in the ozone concentration. Peaks as high as 200 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) were observed during the Stratospheric Ozone Intercomparison Campaign (STOIC) compared to a normal background level near 50 ppbv. These measurements, made during STOIC, were important in assessing <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface ozone concentration on the various instruments participating in the campaign...|$|R
