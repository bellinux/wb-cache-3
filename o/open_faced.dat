2500|$|The typical harquebusier {{would have}} worn an iron cuirass, with a breast and backplate, and an <b>open</b> <b>faced</b> helmet {{such as a}} lobster-tailed pot; the fashion {{conscious}} could replace the helmet with a broad-brimmed felt hat, often worn over a concealed iron skullcap or secrete. In England, in 1629, a harquebusier's armour cost one pound and six shillings, that of a cuirassier four pounds and ten shillings. A more wealthy harquebusier may have worn a buff coat (the finest quality buff coats were often more expensive than an iron cuirass) under his armour and a metal gauntlet to protect his bridle hand and forearm. Also worn were tall, cuff-topped riding boots; these reached the thigh and were often also of buff leather. [...] Munition-quality armour at this time was usually of iron, sometimes containing small amounts of phosphorus, this addition gave a minimal increase in hardness. Officers and other wealthy men would have had access to steel armour, which was carefully heat treated to harden it.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} compare {{sampling}} efficiencies of total and inhalable dust methods, three airborne dust sampling systems, 7 -Hole sampler, close and <b>open</b> <b>face</b> filter cassette were compared side-by-side, as stationary {{and for the}} personal samplers, in a wood working industry to evaluate their relative efficiency. A total of 162 samples were collected. The study of particle size distribution by cascade impactor indicated that the particles smaller than 4. 7 and 11 comprise about 13 % and 30 % of biology total dust respectively and therefore about 70 % of particles are greater than 11. The 7 -Hole gave a higher dust concentration measurement than <b>open</b> <b>face</b> and close face filter cassettes, in all processes, P 11, compared to the <b>open</b> <b>face</b> and close <b>face</b> filter cassettes. <b>Open</b> <b>face</b> and close face filter which were expected to give equivalent results measured statistically equivalent dust concentrations...|$|R

5000|$|The {{use of a}} 3-bevel (Quinke) needles {{is highly}} {{associated}} with PDPH as the geometry of the needle can create a [...] "flap" [...] that allows CSF leakage when inserted in standard horizontal position (<b>open</b> <b>face</b> of needle cephalad). Inserting the needle vertically (<b>open</b> <b>face</b> directed left or right) splits the dural fibers and reduced the flap size. However older clinicians advocate completely inverting the needle and inserting horizontally but upside down so the <b>open</b> <b>face</b> of the Quinke is directed caudad. This also creates a flap but the geometry is inverted so that the flap is {{on the inside of}} the dura and is forced closed by hydrostatic pressure. The incidence of PDPD using a Quinke needle in standard orientation is approximately 3%-7%, Approximately 1.5%-3% when inserted vertically; Approximately 0.1% when inserted inverted.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} Art Gallery Problem for face guards in {{polyhedral}} environments. The {{problem can be}} infor-mally stated as: how many (not necessarily convex) windows should we place on the external walls of a dark building, in order to completely illuminate it? We consider both closed and <b>open</b> <b>face</b> guards (i. e., faces with or without their boundary), and we give some {{upper and lower bounds}} on the minimum number of faces required to guard a given polyhedron, in terms {{of the total number of}} its faces, f. In some notable cases, our bounds are tight: bf/ 6 c <b>open</b> <b>face</b> guards for orthogonal polyhedra, and bf/ 4 c <b>open</b> <b>face</b> guards for 4 -oriented polyhedra (i. e., polyhedra whose faces have only four different orientations). Then we show that it is NP-hard to approximate the minimum number of (closed or <b>open)</b> <b>face</b> guards within a factor of Ω(log f), even for polyhedra that are orthogonal and simply connected. Along the way we discuss some applications, arguing that face guards are not a reasonable model for guards patrolling on the surface of a polyhedron. ...|$|R
