5|$|The {{remaining}} {{parts of}} the castle continued {{to be used as}} a manor house into the 14th century. By the 18th century, however, Dolbadarn Castle was ruined and uninhabited. From the 1760s onwards, however, it became a popular topic for painters interested in the then fashionable landscape styles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sublime</b> and the Picturesque. Typically the castle was painted in the middle ground, allowing the viewer's eye to contrast its ruined outline with the lakes and mountains of Snowdonia; frequently the landscape was misrepresented by the artist, to create a more striking or dramatic effect. J. M. W. Turner's 1800 work Dolbadarn Castle depicted the back-lit castle looming over the landscape and became particularly famous, but the paintings of the castle by Richard Wilson and Paul Sandby also represent important artistic works of the period.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{attacked}} {{not only}} hereditary privilege, {{but also the}} rhetoric that Burke used to defend it. Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as his theatrical pity for Marie Antoinette, but Wollstonecraft was unique in her love of Burke's gendered language. By saying the sublime and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sublime</b> and Beautiful (1756), she kept his rhetoric {{as well as his}} argument. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia Johnson describes as unsurpassed in its argumentative force, Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's justification of an equal society founded on the passivity of women.|$|E

5|$|On 20 October 1868, Khrimian {{was ordained}} as a bishop in Etchmiadzin. On 4 September 1869 {{he was elected}} as the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, who was the de facto leader of the Armenian {{community}} of the Ottoman Empire in both religious and secular matters. According to Ali Tekkoyun, a Turkish scholar of religion, his election indicated that the Amira (wealthiest) class and the imperial authorities lost power over the Armenians as went against their interests. He cleared the patriarchate's debt and sought to increase the provincial representation in the Armenian National Assembly. As the de facto political leader of the Christian Armenian millet in the eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sublime</b> Porte, he prepared a detailed report documenting instances of oppression, persecution, and miscarriage of justice in the Armenian provinces and presented the document to the Sublime Porte. Khrimian used the position to advance the interests and conditions {{of the poor and}} oppressed provincial Armenians.|$|E

Wordsworth experiences both aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sublime.</b> However, he does go beyond Burke or Kant's definition of the literary sublime, for his ultimate goal is to find Enlightenment within the sublime.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project examines how video games can {{be programmed to}} generate <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digital <b>sublime.</b> <b>The</b> digital <b>sublime</b> is a term proposed by this research to describe experiences where <b>the</b> combination <b>of</b> code and art produces games that appear boundless and autonomous. <b>The</b> definition <b>of</b> this term is arrived at by building on various texts and literature such as <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> Kant, Deleuze and Wark and on video games such as Proteus, Minecraft and Love. The research is based on <b>the</b> investigative practice <b>of</b> my work as an artist-programmer and demonstrates how games can be produced to encourage digitally <b>sublime</b> scenarios. In <b>the</b> three games developed for this thesis I employ computer code as an artistic medium, to generate games that explore permutational complexity and present experiences that walk the margins between confusion and control. <b>The</b> structure <b>of</b> this thesis begins with a reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kantian <b>sublime,</b> which I introduce {{as the foundation for}} my definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digital <b>sublime.</b> I then combine this reading with elements of contemporary philosophy and computational theory to establish a definition applicable to <b>the</b> medium <b>of</b> digital games. This definition is used to guide my art practice in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> three games that examine different aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digital <b>sublime</b> such as autonomy, abstraction, complexity and permutation. <b>The</b> production <b>of</b> these games is at <b>the</b> core <b>of</b> my research methodology and their development and analysis is used to produce contributions in the following areas. 1. New models for artist-led game design. This includes methods that re-contextualise existing aesthetic forms such as futurism, synaesthesia and romantic landscape through game design and coding. It also presents techniques that merge visuals and mechanics into a format developed for artistic and philosophical enquiry. 2. <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> new procedural and generative techniques in <b>the</b> programming <b>of</b> video games. This includes <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> a realtime marching cubes algorithm that generates fractal noise filtered terrain. It also includes a versatile three-dimensional space packing architectural construction algorithm. 3. A new reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digital <b>sublime.</b> This reading draws from <b>the</b> Kantian <b>sublime</b> and <b>the</b> writings <b>of</b> Deleuze, Wark and De Landa in order to present an understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digital <b>sublime</b> specific to <b>the</b> domain <b>of</b> art practice within video games. These contributions are evidenced in <b>the</b> writing <b>of</b> this thesis and in <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> associated portfolio <b>of</b> games...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{the ways in}} which Toni Morrison incorporates <b>the</b> non-linguistic code <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slave <b>sublime,</b> a term coined by Paul Gilroy in his 1993 study The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness, through <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> music, dance, colors, and scars within A Mercy, Beloved, and Jazz. <b>The</b> slave <b>sublime</b> enables her characters to create solidarity and foster healing from <b>the</b> traumatic past <b>of</b> slavery and its aftermath for themselves as well as the African-American community without reinforcing the hegemonic language. Highlighting the usage and function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slave <b>sublime</b> in Morrison's novels may shed light on the way in which contemporary African-American novelists struggle with the tension between writing in the hegemonic language that is saturated with a history <b>of</b> oppression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people they seek to reconstruct and the desire to tell these stories that defy direct representation...|$|R

25|$|The {{literary}} sublime, {{as well as}} the philosophical, aesthetic sublimes, {{is inherently}} connected to nature but, as with most literary terms, the sublime evolved alongside literature. More authors began to connect the natural sublime to an internalized emotion of terror. Authors began to see the sublime, with its inherent contradictions (pain and pleasure, terror and awe) as representative of the changing political and cultural climate of the times. They began to incorporate more aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sublime</b> into their literary works as a way of externalizing their inner conflicts. In this way, the sublime particularly appealed to the Romantics.|$|E
