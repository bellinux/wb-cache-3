Methodology – For {{the purpose of this}} research a literature analysis on community and non-profit organization case studies was conducted. The case studies describing stories of success were singled out and leaders of these organizations were interviewed. Findings – The research has showed the growth of the number of community and nonprofit organizations during the last twenty years and the difficulties of collecting the statistical data. This study presupposes the possibility to identify the tendencies of management in community and non-profit organizations, including the following: increasing use of the social networks for communication; proliferation of strategic planning; greater emphasis on educating and empowering new generation of leaders. Research implications – Prior studies in this area in Lithuania have not exhaustively analyzed the components of human resource management of non-profit organizations. An important follow up on this study would be to analyze the human resource management in community organizations.

40|$|It {{has been}} said that you should never send a changed person back to an {{unchanged}} <b>organization.</b> In <b>management</b> <b>development</b> programs, we always do. That is because we disconnect the learner from the natural context of his or her learning, namely the workplace back home. As a consequence, we emphasize leadership, apart―“participant-focused. ” What we need instead is learning that is communityfocused, and impact-focused, to develop better organizations {{in the process of developing}} better managers, rather than just hoping that this will happen as a consequence of having developed them. We had been working on this for fifteen years, with some successes, until we realized recently what had been holding us back―and others too. No matter how supported were the managers participating in our programs, even in teams of colleagues from their own organization, when they went back to their workplaces, each was alone, with no evident way to connect that learning to their context, and use it to make changes. So why not back them up with impact teams back home, made up of people they work with every day, to extend the learning for greater <b>management</b> <b>development,</b> and the implications of that learning for more serious <b>organization</b> <b>development.</b> 1 Thanks to Kristien Weidenmann of Lufthansa especially for the diagram...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master's thesis is to explain why an {{enterprise}} decides to progress with <b>management</b> <b>development</b> and adjustments over time. The Oil Firm, who requested to remain anonymous, has formed the assignment's case and their two <b>management</b> <b>development</b> programs have been my two sub-cases. I decided {{to break down the}} time period from 2006 to 2012. Additionally, I incorporated interviews and qualitative content analysis in order to demonstrate the reasoning and the implementation of the action. One of the main aims of this thesis is to attempt to explain the reasoning and implementation of <b>management</b> <b>development.</b> In order to do this I selected three organizational theory perspectives: an instrumental, a cultural, and a myth perspective. The study showed that the instrumental perspective had the greatest explanatory power in this case. The reasoning for <b>management</b> <b>development</b> was to create awareness among the managers and to build up a culture, identity and a community. The <b>management</b> <b>development</b> originated from employee demand, (who had clear goals for the project). The findings in the study revealed that over time the development changed its goal of having a community and an organizational culture towards a more individual and motivational development. The development over time was based on learning and rational choices. The <b>management</b> <b>development</b> was successful in terms of the expectations that the staff and the participants had. My main findings in the thesis are that age and time will most likely be a critical factor for when one starts the progress with <b>management</b> <b>development.</b> In a young <b>organization</b> <b>management</b> <b>development</b> {{can be viewed as a}} tool in order to structure an organization and managers. My main impression is that <b>management</b> <b>development</b> is a process that requires involvement, local support and clear goals.

40|$|IntroductionBecause of {{the need}} for a well-trained public health workforce, {{professional}} competencies have been recently revised by the Institute of Medicine and the National Health Educator Competencies Update Project. This study compared the self-identified training needs of public health educators with the updated competencies and assessed employer support for continuing education. MethodsA convenience sample of public health educators was recruited from an e-mail list of San Jose State University master of public health alumni. Respondents completed a Web-based survey that elicited information on emerging trends in public health education, training needs, and employer support for continuing education. ResultsConcerns about funding cuts and privatization of resources emerged as a theme. Key trends reported were an increase in information technology, the need for policy advocacy skills, and the importance of a lifespan approach to health issues. Primary areas for training were <b>organization</b> <b>development,</b> evaluation, and <b>management.</b> Although most employers were reported to support continuing education, less than two-thirds of respondents were reimbursed for expenses.
