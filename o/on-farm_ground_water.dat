Little Stony Creek water, Hyphus Creek water, Franciscan Complex regional <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> Great Valley Group regional <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> and local shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> were collected during wet and dry seasons and were analyzed for deuterium, oxygen- 18, temperature, pH, redox potential, conductivity, and major cation and anion concentrations. Turnover in the local flow system is rapid indicating that local shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is dependent on recent recharge. Local shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is recharged primarily by Little Stony Creek water and Franciscan Complex <b>ground</b> <b>water.</b> In the wet season, Little Stony Creek is the more prominent source of local shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> and the ratio of Little Stony Creek water to Franciscan Complex <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> decreases with distance from the channel. In the dry season, Franciscan Complex <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is the more prominent source of local shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> and the ratio of Little Stony Creek water to Franciscan Complex <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> decreases with distance down the valley.

The measurements demonstrate {{the significance of these}} <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge components for deep <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow systems in fractured granites of a high alpine catchment in the Central Alps, Switzerland. Hydrochemical and in situ parameters, as well as δ 18 O in <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> samples collected in the tunnel, show only small temporal variations. The precipitation record of δ 18 O shows seasonal variations of ~ 14 ‰ and a decrease of 0. 23 ‰ ± 0. 03 ‰ per 100 m elevation gain. δ 2 H and δ 18 O in precipitation are well correlated and plot close to the meteoric water line, as well as δ 2 H and δ 18 O in <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> samples, reflecting the meteoric origin of the latter. The depletion of 18 O in <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> compared to 18 O content in precipitation during the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge period indicates significant contributions from accumulated depleted winter precipitation to <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge.

It was also confirmed by the result of the logging ofthe <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow in the boreholes. The distribution of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> storage can be givenfrom a contour map of the water table and a geological map showing the thickness of permeablelayer (mainly weathered andesite). The path of significant <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow was estimatedthrough the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> tracing and the geochemical investigation of land waters.

40|$|Land {{reclamation}} {{has been}} a common practice to produce valuable land in coastal areas. The impact of land reclamation on coastal environment and marine ecology is well recognized and widely studied. It has not been recognized yet that reclamation may change the regional <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime, which may in turn modify the coastal environment, flooding pattern, and stability of slopes and foundations. This paper represents the first attempt to examine quantitatively the effect of reclamation on <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> levels. Analytical solutions are developed to study the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> change in response to reclamation based on two hypothetical models. In the first model, the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow regime changes only in the hillside around the reclamation areas. In the second model, the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime changes in the entire hill. Both models assume that the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow is in a steady state and satisfies the Dupuit assumptions. Hypothetical examples are used to demonstrate how the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> level, <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> divide and <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> submarine discharge will change with the scale and hydraulic conductivity of the reclamation materials. The {{results show that the}} change of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime depends mainly on the length of the reclaimed area and the values of hydraulic conductivity of the reclaimed materials. It is also seen that the reclamation may impact not only the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime near the coast areas around the reclamation site, but also that in the coast areas opposite the reclamation area.
