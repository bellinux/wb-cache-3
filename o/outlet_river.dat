25|$|Early European explorers found Miami and Potawatomi peoples {{living near}} the mouth of the St. Joseph River at the site of present-day St. Joseph and Benton Harbor. The {{original}} Miami name for the river was Sakiwäsipi (<b>Outlet</b> <b>River),</b> later it was known as Kociihsasiipi. In 1654, Médard Chouart des Groseilliers of France and a French companion were the first Europeans to travel the river. In 1675 Père Jacques Marquette had come up from the Mississippi River via the Illinois River, then to the Kankakee River and portaged to the St. Joseph River near modern-day South Bend, Indiana and then down to Lake Michigan. On November 1, 1679 René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle sailed southeast across Lake Michigan and built Fort Miami {{at the mouth of the}} river. La Salle named the river La Rivière des Miamis (River of the Miamis).|$|E

50|$|From about 3,000 {{years ago}} {{until the year}} 1900, the Des Plaines River and the Chicago River were {{connected}} in the ancient stream bed of the Chicago <b>Outlet</b> <b>River</b> by a slough or swampy area known as Mud Lake. This remnant was left behind when the water level of Lake Michigan-Huron dropped as the St. Clair River captured {{the flow of the}} Chicago <b>Outlet</b> <b>River.</b> Mud Lake could be wet, dry, marshy, or frozen, depending on the season and the weather, making it a difficult, albeit very valuable, transportation route. It was drained in several stages, starting with the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal in 1848, which bisected it. Several other attempts were made to drain Mud Lake, with the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal finally accomplishing this in 1900.|$|E
50|$|The Chicago Portage {{was formed}} as the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} retreated northward about 10,000 years ago, leaving behind Lake Chicago consisting of its meltwater. Lake Chicago found its only outlet at its southwestern edge, where it overflowed the Valparaiso Moraine which encircles the southern {{half of the}} Lake Chicago/Lake Michigan basin, creating the Chicago <b>Outlet</b> <b>River.</b> This was a substantial river, carving the channel later used by the main and south branches of the Chicago River, and the Des Plaines River. Eventually the glaciers melted far enough northward that Lake Chicago was connected to Lake Huron, a combination sometimes called Lake Michigan-Huron, resulting in a significant drop in the water level. Until perhaps 3,000 years ago, the combined lakes had two outlets, one at Chicago, and the other via the St. Clair River at Port Huron, Michigan. Eventually the St. Clair River outlet eroded slightly more quickly, resulting in stream capture of the Chicago <b>Outlet</b> <b>River</b> as the water level of Lake Michigan-Huron gradually declined. However, until man-made canals and levees were built within the past 170 years, during periods of heavy rain or downstream ice dams, the Des Plaines River could still flood eastward through a marshy area of {{the bed of the}} former Chicago <b>Outlet</b> <b>River</b> known as Mud Lake, across the continental divide into the Chicago River and then into Lake Michigan.|$|E

50|$|About 11,000 {{years before}} present, the Laurentian Glacier has retreated northward, forming a {{boundary}} across the northern edges of Lake Superior and Lake Huron. The water level was at 605 ft above sea level, creating a single {{body of water}} in the three basins of Lake Michigan, Lake Huron and Lake Superior. The lake drained through three outlets, the Chicago <b>Outlet</b> <b>River,</b> the St. Clair-Detroit River, and through the Trent Valley.|$|E

50|$|Jetties {{have been}} {{constructed}} {{on each side of}} the <b>outlet</b> <b>river</b> of some of the rivers flowing into the Baltic, with the objective of prolonging the scour of the river and protecting the channel from being shoaled by the littoral drift along the shore. The most interesting application of parallel jetties is in lowering the bar in front of one of the mouths of a deltaic river flowing into a tide — a virtual prolongation of its less sea, by extending the scour of the river out to the bar by banks. Jetties prolonging the Sulina branch of the Danube into the Black Sea, and the south pass of the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico, formed of rubble stone and concrete blocks, and respectively, have enabled the discharge of these rivers to scour away the bars obstructing the access to them; and they have also carried the sediment-bearing waters sufficiently far out to come under the influence of littoral currents, which, by conveying away some of the sediment, postpone the eventual formation of a fresh bar farther out (see river engineering).|$|E
50|$|Certain {{extraordinary}} {{features were}} produced when the retreat {{of the ice}} sheet had progressed {{so far as to}} open an eastward outlet for the marginal lakes. This outlet occurred along the depression between the northward slope of the Appalachian plateau in west-central New York and the southward slope of the melting ice sheet. When this eastward outlet came to be lower than the south-westward outlet across the height of land to the Ohio or Mississippi river, the discharge of the marginal lakes was changed from the Mississippi system to the Hudson system. Many well-defined channels, cutting across the north-sloping spurs of the plateau in the neighborhood of Syracuse, New York, mark the temporary paths of the ice-bordered <b>outlet</b> <b>river.</b> Successive channels are found at lower and lower levels on the plateau slope, indicating the successive courses taken by the lake outlet as the ice melted farther and farther back. On some of these channels, deep gorges were eroded heading in temporary cataracts which exceeded Niagara in height but not in breadth. The pools excavated by the plunging waters {{at the head of the}} gorges are now occupied by little lakes. The most significant stage in this series of changes occurred when the glacio-marginal lake waters were lowered so that the long escarpment of Niagara limestone was laid bare in western New York. The previously confluent waters were then divided into two lakes. The higher one, Lake Erie, supplied the outflowing Niagara River, which poured its waters down the escarpment to the lower, Lake Ontario. This gave rise to Niagara Falls. Lake Ontario's outlet for a time ran down the Mohawk Valley to the Hudson River. At this higher elevation it was known as Lake Iroquois. When the ice melted from the northeastern end of the lake, it dropped to a lower level, and drained through the St. Lawrence area. This created a lower base level for the Niagara River, increasing its erosive capacity.|$|E

The results indicate that flow capacity of the Seta River was expanded after the dregging in Tempo years (1831 - 1833), and that there were no notable changes in flow capacity during Meiji Period (1874 - 1899) ...|$|E

40|$|A major {{introduced}} run of {{sockeye salmon}} at Frazer Lake, Kodiak Island, Alaska, is perpetuated by an Alaska steeppass fishway at a 10 -m-high {{falls on the}} <b>outlet</b> <b>river.</b> Experimental modifications of the fishway, which was inadequate by 1970 as the salmon run increased, improved salmon entry and passage. Sockeye passage over 4 yr. was nearly equivalent in a steeppass of 60 m continuous length (22 % slope) and an adjoining steeppass with three resting pools, but significant year-to-year differences in passage occurred between steeppasses. Resting tanks were beneficial for holding slower or descending salmon without blocking passage of other salmon. An average entry of 142 sockeye in 15 min was achieved by guiding all salmon along a weir to an entrance tank with a vertical slot orifice. Chutes installed in the entry end of the steeppasses created a high-velocity stream for attraction and decreased salmon dropout from the entrance tank. Salmon passage in the original steeppasses with three resting pools was greater than in new steeppasses with a single resting pool. In 1985, sockeye passage of 2925 /h and 46806 /d exceeded fishway capacity requirements...|$|E
