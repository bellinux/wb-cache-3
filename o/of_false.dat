5|$|Although The Castafiore Emerald {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} for making its characters follow a lead <b>of</b> <b>false</b> trails, {{it was not}} a commercial success due to the experimental nature of its narrative. It was published as a book by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Flight 714 to Sydney, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The story was adapted for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{centers on}} an asymmetry, or bias, in the {{accuracy}} of multi-criteria, conjunctive and disjunctive decisions, which originates from fundamental properties of the logical conjunction and disjunction operations. A series of Monte Carlo simulations demonstrates that, as we keep adding criteria to a multi-criteria satisficing decision rule, errors in the data produce decision errors asymmetrically. As a result, in conjunctive decisions, the probability <b>of</b> a <b>false</b> negative increases steadily while the probability <b>of</b> a <b>false</b> positive decreases. In contrast, in disjunctive decisions, as we keep adding criteria, the probability <b>of</b> a <b>false</b> positive increases while that <b>of</b> a <b>false</b> negative decreases. Take, for instance, a conjunctive business decision where the individual decision criteria do not exhibit a substantially higher probability <b>of</b> a <b>false</b> positive than a false negative. In such a decision, the probability of overlooking a bargain can be far greater than the probability of misjudging an unattractive offer {{to be a good}} one...|$|R

5|$|In 2005, {{the stadium}} gained {{national}} attention when the visiting New York Giants committed 11 false start penalties. Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren attributed the penalties to the enthusiasm and {{noise from the}} crowd. He dedicated the ball {{used to make the}} game-winning field goal to the fans, and it is now displayed at the stadium. The Giants' general manager, Ernie Accorsi, asked an NFL senior vice president whether the Seahawks had broadcast artificial crowd noise over the public address system during this game. The NFL sent a memorandum early in the 2006 season about such complaints and sent officials to monitor two games. Holmgren denied the allegations, and the crowd responded by being even louder than usual when the Giants returned to CenturyLink Field. Since 2005 the Seahawks have tracked the number <b>of</b> <b>false</b> starts committed by visiting teams and display the statistic on a scoreboard to motivate the crowd. As of 2013, the stadium has had a league-high number <b>of</b> <b>false</b> starts since. In preparation for 2005–06 NFC Championship Game at CenturyLink Field, the Carolina Panthers practiced with the recorded sounds of jet engines in the background to prepare for the volume of the crowd.|$|E

5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are {{required by law to}} be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount <b>of</b> <b>false</b> morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption <b>of</b> <b>false</b> morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter in a saucepan, flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.|$|E
