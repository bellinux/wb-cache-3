5|$|As {{a result}} of these negotiations, in September 2013 Syria joined the Chemical Weapons Convention (formally acceding on 14 October), and agreed to the {{destruction}} of its chemical weapons, {{under the supervision of the}} Organisation for the Prohibition <b>of</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons,</b> as required by the Convention.|$|E
5|$|In October 1935, Italian {{dictator}} Benito Mussolini sent 400,000 {{troops to}} invade Abyssinia (Ethiopia). Marshal Pietro Badoglio led the campaign from November 1935, ordering bombing, the use <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> such as mustard gas, and the poisoning of water supplies, against targets which included undefended villages and medical facilities. The modern Italian Army defeated the poorly armed Abyssinians and captured Addis Ababa in May 1936, forcing Emperor of Ethiopia Haile Selassie to flee.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of Syria's chemical weapons began in September 2013 {{on the basis}} of several international agreements with Syria that stipulated an initial destruction deadline of 30 June 2014. United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118 of 27 September 2013 required Syria to assume responsibility for and follow a timeline for the {{destruction of}} its chemical weapons and its chemical weapon production facilities. The resolution bound Syria to the implementation plan presented in a decision of the Organisation for the Prohibition <b>of</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> (OPCW). On 23 June 2014, the last declared chemical weapons were shipped out of Syria for destruction. The destruction of the most dangerous chemical weapons was performed at sea aboard the Cape Ray, a vessel of the United States Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force, crewed with U.S. civilian merchant mariners. The actual destruction operations, performed by a team of U.S. Army civilians and contractors, destroyed 600 metric tons of chemical agents in 42 days. However, despite these efforts, the use <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> in Syria have continued to be reported, with the latest being the chemical attack on Khan Shaykhun in April 2017, which has been alleged to have been perpetrated by the Syrian government.|$|E

5|$|McCloskey {{asked an}} aide to arrange {{a press conference in}} Zagreb the next day, while the aide persuaded Dr. Jerry Blaskovich, an Associate Clinical Professor at the LAC+USC Medical Center, sent to Croatia to {{investigate}} alleged use <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons,</b> {{to take part in the}} investigation of the killings. At the conference, McCloskey called the killings genocide. CNN reporter Mark Dalmish refused to attend the press conference as the network mistrusted reports of the killings, and reportedly only became interested in the event once Blaskovich's involvement was announced.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shipment}} of components for chemical weapons {{were removed from}} Syria by a Norwegian/Danish flotilla on 7 January 2014. The 31 December deadline for complete removal of priority chemicals had been missed; on 7 January, the New York Times assessed the delay {{was due to the}} difficulty of overland transport <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> {{in the middle of a}} civil war. A second shipment was removed around 27 January; that same day, the U.N. Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, expressed concern over the worsening delays and assessed that Syria already has the resources required to transport the weapons promptly despite the ongoing civil war.|$|E
5|$|Three of the {{surviving}} ships, Lübeck, München, and Danzig, were seized by Britain as war prizes {{after the end of}} the war and sold for scrapping. The other two ships, Hamburg and Berlin, were used as training cruisers through the 1920s. They were converted into barracks ships in the mid-1930s, a role they filled for a decade; in 1944, Hamburg was sunk by British bombers and later broken up for scrap, while Berlin was scuttled in deep water after the end of World War II to dispose of a load <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E

50|$|One of the focuses <b>of</b> the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> Convention was {{to assign}} {{responsibility}} for the destruction <b>of</b> old <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> in China. The Convention was signed in 1993 and according to it, all <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> created after 1925 must be destroyed by the originating-country.

25|$|In 1993, the U.S. {{signed the}} CWC, which {{required}} the destruction <b>of</b> all <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> agents, dispersal systems, <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> production facilities by 2012. Both Russia and U.S. missed the CWC's extended deadline of April 2012 to destroy all <b>of</b> their <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons.</b> The United States destroyed 89.75% {{of the original}} stockpile of nearly 31,100 metric tons (30,609 long tons) of nerve and mustard agents under the terms <b>of</b> the treaty. <b>Chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> destruction resumed in 2015 with expected completion by 2023.|$|R
5|$|World War I was {{the most}} devastating in British {{military}} history, with nearly 800,000 men killed and over twomillion wounded. Early in the war, the BEF was virtually destroyed and was replaced first by volunteers and then a conscript force. Major battles included those at the Somme and Passchendaele. Advances in technology saw {{the advent of the}} tank (and the creation of the Royal Tank Regiment) and advances in aircraft design (including the creation of the Royal Flying Corps) which would be decisive in future battles. Trench warfare dominated Western Front strategy for most of the war, and the use <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> (disabling and poison gases) added to the devastation.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{agencies}} and individuals {{associated with the}} UN have won the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their work. Two Secretaries-General, Dag Hammarskjöld and Kofi Annan, were each awarded the prize (in 1961 and 2001, respectively), as were Ralph Bunche (1950), a UN negotiator, René Cassin (1968), {{a contributor to the}} Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the US Secretary of State Cordell Hull (1945), the latter {{for his role in the}} organization's founding. Lester B. Pearson, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing the UN's first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis. UNICEF won the prize in 1965, the International Labour Organization in 1969, the UN Peace-Keeping Forces in 1988, the International Atomic Energy Agency (which reports to the UN) in 2005, and the UN-supported Organization for the Prohibition <b>of</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> in 2013. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees was awarded in 1954 and 1981, becoming one of only two recipients to win the prize twice. The UN as a whole was awarded the prize in 2001, sharing it with Annan.|$|E
5|$|Thuan {{started an}} inquiry into the usage <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> on the protestors. The {{investigation}} exonerated the Diệm regime {{of the most serious}} allegations of using poison or mustard gas. Before the president was deposed in November, the inquiry's report declared that only tear gas was used, and that the liquid components of the grenades were poured onto the protestors after they had failed to vaporize as they were designed to. A further commission chaired by General Trần Văn Đôn prior to February 1964 concluded that the tear gas was left behind by French colonial forces in the 1950s. The tear gas used came in glass containers {{in the form of a}} liquid that was transformed into gaseous vapor upon activation by acid. The injuries were attributed to the acid failing to activate the liquid into gaseous form. United States Army chemists in Maryland confirmed that the tear gas had come from canisters dating back to French World War I stocks. During World War I, France had used tear gas containing a mixture of chloroacetone and ethyl bromoacetate against German troops at Ypres on the Western Front, which was known to strongly irritate mucous membranes.|$|E
