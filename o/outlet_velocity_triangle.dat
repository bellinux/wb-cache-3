25|$|An {{axial fan}} {{consists}} of much fewer blades i.e., two to six, {{as compared to}} ducted fans. Axial fans operate at high specific speed i.e., high flow rate and low head and hence adding more blades will restrict the high flow rate required for its operation. Due to fewer blades, {{they are unable to}} impose their geometry on the flow, making the rotor geometry and the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>triangles</b> meaningless. Also the blades are made very long with varying blade sections along the radius.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Velocity</b> <b>triangles</b> {{can be used}} to {{calculate}} the basic performance of a turbine stage. Gas exits the stationary turbine nozzle guide vanes at absolute velocity Va1. The rotor rotates at velocity U. Relative to the rotor, the velocity of the gas as it impinges on the rotor entrance is Vr1. The gas is turned by the rotor and exits, relative to the rotor, at velocity Vr2. However, in absolute terms the rotor exit velocity is Va2. The <b>velocity</b> <b>triangles</b> are constructed using these various <b>velocity</b> vectors. <b>Velocity</b> <b>triangles</b> can be constructed at any section through the blading (for example: hub, tip, midsection and so on) but are usually shown at the mean stage radius.

40|$|The {{increase}} on {{the usage of}} non-renewable energy has caused high demanding on energy supplies. This demand is highly needed for the industrial, transportation, domestic usage and etc. Shortage in the non-renewable energy had caused human to find other alternatives to generate energy. Hence, this research is aim to develop a flume, that later use to generate electricity. However, researcher only focuses on the design {{and analysis of the}} piping system of the flume. The objectives of this research is to design piping system of an open channel with less head losses and simulate it using CFD for only single phase perform (not free service), to evaluate the pressure drop in the pipes and to analyses and determine the head losses in the pipe. The instrument used is Solid Work 2012 for technical drawing of the piping system and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for simulation of the design and analysis. There are four designs of piping system that had been produce which is Design A, Design B, Design C and Design D, the properties measured for all four designs are pressure drop, percentage pressure drop, head loss and velocity. Design A; average percentage of pressure drop is 40. 2 %, average head loss which is 2. 7 m, velocity; inlet velocity is 8. 84 m/s and average <b>outlet</b> <b>velocity</b> is 8. 75 m/s. Design B; average percentage of pressure drop is 53. 6 %, average head loss which is 5. 8 m, velocity; inlet velocity is 8. 84 m/s and average <b>outlet</b> <b>velocity</b> is 14. 31 m/s.

40|$|In {{the present}} study the flow field near the orifice of a plane wall jet is in focus. Two main flow regions may be {{distinguished}} in the wall-jet, i. e. a free shear layer {{away from the wall}} and a boundary layer close to the surface. In both of these layers streamwise coherent structures are detected by means of smoke visualization and hot-wire measurements. The structures, which occur naturally, have different spanwise scales and emerge at different distance from the nozzle. Effects of the flow velocity, upstream perturbations and acoustic excitation on the generation and characteristics of the streamwise disturbances are investigated and especially the interaction between the two layers is studied. In order to resolve the complex 3 D flow by means of hot-wires a system for accurate automated traversing and data acquisition has been developed. It was found that the value of <b>outlet</b> <b>velocity</b> and the frequency of Kelvin-Helmholts rolls have a clear influence {{on the size of the}} structures.

At the investigated range of this paper, the food package temperature decreases when the air curtain velocity increases, but the food package temperature also increases with increase of ambient temperature and humidity.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design optimization of a tunnel ventilation jet fan through multi-objective optimization techniques. Four design variables {{were selected for}} design optimization.

Two objective functions, the total efficiency of the forward direction and the ratio of the reverse direction <b>outlet</b> <b>velocity</b> to the forward direction <b>outlet</b> <b>velocity,</b> were employed, and multi-objective optimization was carried out to improve the aerodynamic performance. A response surface approximation surrogate model was constructed for each objective function based on numerical solutions obtained at specified design points.

The tradeoff between the two objectives was determined and described with respect to the Pareto-optimal solutions. Based on the analysis of the optimization results, we propose an optimization model to satisfy the objective function.
