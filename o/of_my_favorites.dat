Sepinwall praised {{particular}} scenes such as Dwight and Andy's competitive duet [...] and Kelly's plan to make Charles want her. She criticized the cramped new office space jokes as being less funny than those in previous episodes. Sepinwall also said the storyline between Jim and Charles was getting repetitive and, [...] "It would help if the writers ever gave Idris Elba something funny to do." [...] Margaret Lions of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "This episode wasn't one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorites</b> … No bombs, no bits that failed, and by The Offices standards, nothing even particularly cringe worthy.

500|$|TV Squad's Adam Finley {{said the}} episode [...] "manages {{to be both}} {{incredibly}} funny and incredibly touching, both signs of a great Simpsons episode". He added that [...] "the episode has some great gags in it, but the emotion is very real, too. Homer is not thrilled {{with the idea of}} having a baby, and the episode does a wonderful job of showing the dark side of having another mouth to feed." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review of the sixth season DVD: [...] "Flashback episodes of The Simpsons usually work well, and [...] is no exception to that rule. Actually, at this point it’s one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorites,</b> but that’s partially because of overexposure to some of the other episodes. In any case, this one has many hilarious moments – such as the scene that explains Homer's hair loss." [...] Kevin Wong at PopMatters said the episode is [...] "a touching look at fatherhood".|$|E

So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E

The song was described by Q magazine as, [...] "The most toxic of strummed kiss-offs, with not a snowball's chance in hell of reconciliation." [...] Dylan, later describing the song, said that [...] "I had carried that song around in my head {{for a long time}} and I remember that when I was writing it, I'd remembered a Gene Vincent song. It had always been one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorites,</b> Baby Blue... 'When first I met my baby/she said how do you do/she looked into my eyes and said/my name is Baby Blue.'

In {{his review of}} The Simpsons – Gone Wild DVD set, David Packard of DVD Verdict wrote: [...] "This episode {{has always been one}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorites,</b> and while the following episode [...] is a nice inclusion as well, this episode is the best on the disc.

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide called the episode [...] "A thoroughly enjoyable romp through what happens when a bunch of lads go for a Sunday out at the ball game." [...] They enjoyed the guest-stars, writing [...] "both Dolly Parton and, bizarrely, Rupert Murdoch – spice things up nicely", however they were most fond of Fred Willard as Wally Kogen. [...] "A shame he doesn't join our regulars", they wrote. James Plath of DVD Town wrote that the episode is [...] "funny," [...] and Ian Jane of DVD Talk found the episode [...] "amusing". The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named it the third best episode of the show with a sports theme.

500|$|In 1963 Donen {{made one}} of his most praised films: Charade, {{starring}} Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass. Donen has said that he had [...] "always wanted to make a movie like one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorites,</b> Hitchcock's North by Northwest" [...] and the film has been referred to as [...] "the best Hitchcock movie that Hitchcock never made." [...] Charade was produced by Stanley Donen Productions, released through Universal and adapted by Peter Stone from his own novel. Reggie Lampert (Hepburn) discovers that her husband has been murdered and (at least) three sinister men are all searching for the $250,000 in gold that he had hidden somewhere. Peter Joshua (Grant) befriends Reggie and helps her fight off the three thugs while the two begin to fall in love, and in the end no one is quite who they seem to be. The film was released in December 1963, only two weeks after the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy, and the word [...] "assassinate" [...] had to be redubbed twice. It was Donen's most financially successful film and influenced a number of romantic comedy-thrillers released in the years following it. Film critic Judith Crist called it a [...] "stylish and amusing melodrama", and Pauline Kael said it had [...] "a freshness and spirit that makes [...] unlike the films of any other country" [...] and was [...] "probably the best American film of [...] ". In 2002 it was remade as The Truth About Charlie, directed by Jonathan Demme.|$|E
500|$|While Carey paved {{a lot of}} {{the album}} with slower and autobiographical ballads, she also {{attempted}} at making an album with a mixture of several different genres. According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, the album showed off Carey's musical and vocal versatility, especially when viewing the differences in the record's first and second singles, [...] "Ms. Carey is known for her voice, of course: she can hit high notes that barely sound human, and few singers leap around the octaves as gracefully as she does.

500|$|Co-director Johnson {{would go}} over each {{scene with the}} animators, {{sometimes}} acting out the scene, if necessary. The animators would create a [...] "dope sheet"—in which a shot was broken down, frame by frame—to account for key [...] "hits". The animators would then shoot tests of the scene, often shooting on [...] "2s" [...] or [...] "4s" [...] (meaning shooting just every second or fourth frame of what would appear in the final animation). Johnson explained: [...] "The next day, when they'd finish their test/rehearsal, we'd cut it in {{and see how it}} played in the reel and fine-tune from there. We might do some lighting tweaks, performance tweaks or have the art department get in and touch anything that needed it. Then we'd close the curtain and let the animator animate the shot." [...] The animators would sometimes make use of the voice and/or video recordings of the actors, a practice also common in cel animation. Once photographed, the frames were manipulated by a team of [...] "data wranglers." [...] Using a workflow developed by Chris Watts, the frames were downloaded from the camera image cards as RAW files, converted to Cineon files and processed through a [...] "color cube." [...] Cinematographer Pete Kozachik explained: [...] "The color cube is a 3D lookup table created by FilmLight Ltd. that forces the image data into behaving like a particular Eastman Kodak film stock—in this case, 5248, one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorites.</b> With this film emulation, we could actually rate our cameras at ASA 100, then take our light meters and spot meters and, with great confidence, shoot as if we were using 5248. Sure enough, the footage would come back and look just like it." [...] The frames could be processed further to generate a TIFF file for viewing on the lighting station computer monitors so lighting, composition and color could be previewed.|$|E

But I didn't like that. I thought let's do something unexpected. So our inspirations were very bizarre. We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was very proud of that look and I thought Franny was very yummy. You could see why people would want her to kiss them." ...|$|E

60|$|One <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorites</b> was Rembrandt. I {{always did}} admire the {{gorgeous}} and solemn mysteries of his coloring. Rembrandt is like Hawthorne. He chooses simple and everyday objects, and so arranges {{light and shadow}} as {{to give them a}} sombre richness and a mysterious gloom. The House of Seven Gables is a succession of Rembrandt pictures, done in words instead of oils. Now, this pleases us, because our life really is a haunted one; the simplest thing in it is a mystery, the invisible world always lies round us like a shadow, and therefore this dreamy golden gleam of Rembrandt meets somewhat in our inner consciousness to which it corresponds. There were no pictures in the gallery which I looked upon so long, and to which I returned so often and with such growing pleasure, as these. I found in them, if not a commanding, a drawing influence, a full satisfaction for one part of my nature.|$|E
