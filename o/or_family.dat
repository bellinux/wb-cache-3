5|$|Patients {{often ask}} {{if they need to}} have special safety {{precautions}} around family and friends after receiving brachytherapy.

5000|$|Income {{deficit is}} the {{difference}} between a single person <b>or</b> <b>family's</b> income and its poverty threshold or poverty line, when the former is exceeded by the latter. Data on the income deficits of various members of a population allow for the construction of one type of measurement of income inequality in that population. Individuals <b>or</b> <b>families</b> that fall below the line are considered to be in poverty whereas families that fall above are not. The income deficit is one of two measures that are used to determine a person <b>or</b> <b>family's</b> income distance from the poverty threshold,the other being a ratio rather than a difference.|$|R
50|$|Agriculture {{is almost}} entirely {{dependent}} on angiosperms, which provide virtually all plant-based food, and also provide {{a significant amount of}} livestock feed. Of all the families of plants, the Poaceae, <b>or</b> grass <b>family</b> (grains), {{is by far the most}} important, providing the bulk of all feedstocks (rice, corn — maize, wheat, barley, rye, oats, pearl millet, sugar cane, sorghum). The Fabaceae, <b>or</b> legume <b>family,</b> comes in second place. Also of high importance are the Solanaceae, <b>or</b> nightshade <b>family</b> (potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers, among others), the Cucurbitaceae, <b>or</b> gourd <b>family</b> (also including pumpkins and melons), the Brassicaceae, <b>or</b> mustard plant <b>family</b> (including rapeseed and the innumerable varieties of the cabbage species Brassica oleracea), and the Apiaceae, <b>or</b> parsley <b>family.</b> Many of our fruits come from the Rutaceae, <b>or</b> rue <b>family</b> (including oranges, lemons, grapefruits, etc.), and the Rosaceae, <b>or</b> rose <b>family</b> (including apples, pears, cherries, apricots, plums, etc.).|$|R

5|$|A group <b>or</b> <b>family</b> is a {{vertical}} {{column in the}} periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell. Consequently, elements in the same group {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number. However, {{in some parts of the}} periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.|$|E
5|$|According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, the {{industry}} of employment of residents aged 16–74 was 18.1% retail and wholesale, 16.5% manufacturing, 12.1% property and business services, 10.9% {{health and social}} work, 7.4% education, 7.1% transport and communications, 7.6% construction, 5.8% public administration, 5.0% finance, 4.1% hotels and restaurants, 0.8% energy and water supply, 0.5% agriculture, 0.1% mining, and 4.2% other. Compared with national figures, the town had a relatively low percentage working in agriculture. The census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16–74, 2.6% students were with jobs, 3.2% students without jobs, 4.7% looking after home <b>or</b> <b>family,</b> 6.7% permanently sick or disabled, and 2.1% economically inactive for other reasons.|$|E
5|$|Also enigmatic were Clintonia, Medeola, Scoliopus, and Tricyrtis. Clintonia, with a disjunct {{distribution}} involving East Asia and North America, and the {{closely related}} Medeola form a subclades {{and are now}} considered a separate tribe (Medeoleae) within the Lilioideae, although at different times they have been considered a separate subfamily (Medeoloideae) <b>or</b> <b>family</b> (Medeolaceae). Sequencing of the rbcL and matK chloroplast genes established monophyly for Clintonia, but with separate clades corresponding to the two areas of distribution. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website (APWeb) includes four of Takhtajan's families in Liliaceae, recognizing three subfamilies, {{one of which is}} divided into two tribes and referred to as Liliaceae sensu APG III.|$|E

Rather, relations that hold true for all geodesics, such as the Raychaudhuri equation, and additional non-specific assumptions about the nature of matter (usually in the form of energy conditions) are used to derive general results.|$|E
