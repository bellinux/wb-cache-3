5|$|Seats in the Circus {{were free}} for the poor, who {{by the time of}} the Empire had little else to do, as they were no longer {{involved}} in political or military affairs as they had been in the Republic. The wealthy could pay for shaded seats where they had a better view, and they probably also spent much of their times betting on the races. The circus was the only place where the emperor showed himself before a populace assembled in vast numbers, and where the latter could manifest their affection <b>or</b> <b>anger.</b> The imperial box, called the pulvinar in the Circus Maximus, was directly connected to the imperial palace.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} on an in-house 3D game engine under construction for multiple years. Each character {{is made of}} over 7000 polygons and 55 bones, making for players with facial expressions, over 800 animations, and a capacity to blink. Character faces can additionally express emotions like happiness <b>or</b> <b>anger,</b> and feelings of pain. The move to Xbox led to greater variation in the team personalities. The artists drew many options for each team and the developers chose from the lot. Deathrow was designed for the Action camera view, but Sports view was introduced to expand the game's appeal.|$|E

5|$|Pokémon Channel is {{difficult}} to categorize into a genre, as it incorporates elements of adventure, simulation, and digital pet games. The graphics are in 3D, the perspective is first-person, and the player navigates and selects things with a cursor. The game centers on watching television programs with a Pikachu, a mouse-like Pokémon. The player, {{who lives in a}} house, can channel-surf freely among the various channels of a television network created by the pokémon professor, Professor Oak, as well as explore one room of the house and several outdoor areas. Pikachu sometimes displays emotional reactions while watching, such as happiness <b>or</b> <b>anger.</b> The game takes place over a few days, with unique plot events on each. The GameCube's inner clock tracks time such that every in-game day lasts at least as long as one real-time day.|$|E

25|$|A gamma camera (γ-camera), {{also called}} a {{scintillation}} camera <b>or</b> <b>Anger</b> camera, is a device used to image gamma radiation emitting radioisotopes, a technique known as scintigraphy.

25|$|Conclusively, {{affective and}} {{cognitive}} emotions and responses both {{play a key}} role in the first stage of infidelity. Whether it is jealousy, feeling of incompetence that leads to resentment, <b>or</b> <b>anger</b> they all can take on both forms of emotions and help to drive the emotional reactions towards infidelity. The affective states of partners determine how they react to secrets or feelings they have not learned to expect from one another which later transforms into cognitive responses as the significant others begin to anticipate the actions and feelings of themselves and their partners.|$|E

25|$|For {{people with}} very light skin, the skin gets {{most of its}} colour from the bluish-white {{connective}} tissue in the dermis and from the haemoglobin associated blood cells circulating in the capillaries of the dermis. The colour associated with the circulating haemoglobin become more obvious, especially in the face, when arterioles dilate and become tumefied with blood {{as a result of}} prolonged physical exercise or stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (usually embarrassment <b>or</b> <b>anger).</b> Up to 50% of UVA can penetrate deeply into the dermis in persons with light skin pigmentation with little protective melanin pigment.|$|E
25|$|People with BPD {{can be very}} {{sensitive}} to the way others treat them, by feeling intense joy and gratitude at perceived expressions of kindness, and intense sadness <b>or</b> <b>anger</b> at perceived criticism or hurtfulness. Their feelings about others often shift from admiration or love to anger or dislike after a disappointment, a threat of losing someone, or a perceived loss of esteem {{in the eyes of}} someone they value. This phenomenon, sometimes called splitting, includes a shift from idealizing others to devaluing them. Combined with mood disturbances, idealization and devaluation can undermine relationships with family, friends, and co-workers. Self-image can also change rapidly from healthy to unhealthy.|$|E

25|$|Barris created {{several other}} {{short-lived}} game shows for ABC in the 1960s and for syndication in the 1970s, {{all of which}} revolved around a common theme: the game play normally derived its interest (and often, humor) from the excitement, vulnerability, embarrassment, <b>or</b> <b>anger</b> of the contestants or participants in the game. Barris also made several attempts through the years at non-game formats, such as ABC's , a variety show staged at military bases akin to USO shows; a CBS revival of Your Hit Parade; and The Bobby Vinton Show, a Canadian-based syndicated variety show for singer Bobby Vinton (produced in conjunction with Chris Bearde and Allan Blye). The last was his most successful program other than a game show.|$|E

The band was joined by Josh Klinghoffer, who to the public was still the band's backup touring guitarist, {{although}} it was later confirmed, that he was already an official member and Frusciante's replacement with Frusciante having quit the band on July 29, 2009. An official announcement on Frusciante's departure wasn't made until December 2009. Frusciante explained on his MySpace page, {{that there was no}} drama <b>or</b> <b>anger</b> about him leaving the band this time, and that the other members were very supportive and understanding. Frusciante said he felt his musical interests had led him in a different direction, and that he needed to fully focus his efforts on his solo career.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} the Pokémon saga stems from the hobby of insect collecting, a popular pastime which game {{designer}} Satoshi Tajiri enjoyed as a child. While growing up, however, he observed more urbanization {{taking place in the}} town where he lived and as a result, the insect population declined. Tajiri noticed that kids now played in their homes instead of outside and he {{came up with the idea}} of a video game, containing creatures that resembled insects, called Pokémon. He thought kids could relate with the Pokémon by individually naming them, and then controlling them to represent fear <b>or</b> <b>anger</b> as a good way of relieving stress. However, Pokémon never bleed or die in battle, only faint– this was a very touchy subject to Tajiri, as he did not want to further fill the gaming world with [...] "pointless violence".|$|E
40|$|Infants’ temperamental <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> {{frustration}} {{reactions are}} highly stable, {{but are also}} influenced by maturation and experience. It is yet unclear why some infants high in <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> frustration reactions develop disruptive behavior problems whereas others do not. We examined family regularity, conceptualized as the consistency of mealtime and bedtime routines, as a protective factor against the development of oppositional and aggressive behavior. This study used prospectively collected data from 3136 families participating in the Generation R Study. Infant <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> frustration reactions and family regularity were reported by mothers when children were ages 6 months and 2 – 4 years, respectively. Multiple informants (parents, teachers, and children) and methods (questionnaire and interview) {{were used in the}} assessment of children’s oppositional and aggressive behavior at age 6. Higher levels of family regularity were associated with lower levels of child aggression independent of temperamental <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> frustration reactions (β = − 0. 05, p = 0. 003). The association between child oppositional behavior and temperamental <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> frustration reactions was moderated by family regularity and child gender (β = 0. 11, p = 0. 046) : family regularity reduced the risk for oppositional behavior among those boys who showed <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> frustration reactions in infancy. In conclusion, family regularity reduced the risk for child aggression and showed a gender-specific protective effect against child oppositional behavior associated with <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> frustration reactions. Families that ensured regularity of mealtime and bedtime routines buffered their infant sons high in <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> frustration reactions from developing oppositional behavior...|$|R

500|$|Emotional {{repression}} is also {{explored in}} Psycho-Pass. The identification of latent criminals is partially based around {{the avoidance of}} emotions that society judges to be negative, such as sadness <b>or</b> <b>anger.</b> To avoid being identified as a latent criminal, one must not feel these emotions heavily outside, where their Psycho-Pass can be scanned. Kotaku states, [...] "because of these scans, Psycho-Pass shows an interesting future where 'mental beauty' is as sought after as physical beauty. It is also a future where the police's job {{is little more than}} to watch the latent criminals they control—because if they did any real detective work, they might start to think like the criminals they are trying to catch and thus become latent criminals themselves." [...] Many of the main characters feel nostalgia throughout the series. The many references to older literature, philosophy, music and theatre create a [...] "nostalgic world building for a time before psycho-passes".|$|E
500|$|Long-term use of benzodiazepines {{has been}} {{associated}} with long-lasting deficits of memory, and show only partial recovery six months after stopping benzodiazepines. It is unclear whether full recovery occurs after longer periods of abstinence. Benzodiazepines can cause or worsen depression. Paradoxical excitement occasionally occurs with benzodiazepines, including a worsening of seizures. Children and elderly individuals or those with a history of alcohol abuse and individuals with a history of aggressive behavior <b>or</b> <b>anger</b> are at increased risk of paradoxical effects. Paradoxical reactions are particularly associated with intravenous administration. After nighttime administration of midazolam, residual 'hangover' effects, such as sleepiness and impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions, may persist into the next day. This may impair the ability of users to drive safely and may increase the risk of falls and hip fractures. Sedation, respiratory depression and hypotension due to a reduction in systematic vascular resistance, and an increase in heart rate can occur. If intravenous midazolam is given too quickly, hypotension may occur. A [...] "midazolam infusion syndrome" [...] may result from high doses, and is characterised by delayed arousal hours to days after discontinuation of midazolam, and may lead to an increase in the length of ventilatory support needed.|$|E
500|$|Scholar Andrea Loewenstein {{published}} the first in-depth review of Bannon's books in 1980, and notes {{that they were}} [...] "exceptionally good pulp" [...] that caused unexpected strong feelings of sadness <b>or</b> <b>anger</b> among lesbians when they were read twenty years after being published. Bannon depicts strict roles of butch and femme, and gays and lesbians as self-destructive, closeted, paranoid, and alcoholic. Loewenstein remarks that readers in 1980 {{had a tendency to}} reject that kind of reality in Bannon's stories. [...] "Since much of our past is so bitter, ... pretend away our most recent history". Loewenstein suggests the struggles Bannon's characters endured were ones that Bannon must have faced herself. When Laura declares her joy in her love for Beth in Odd Girl Out while simultaneously questioning if it is right, Loewenstein states [...] "one hears quite clearly the voice of Ann Bannon, questioning her own right to happiness". Similarly, remarking on Bannon's treatment of Beebo in Women in the Shadows by making her violent, alcoholic and self-destructive, Loewenstein notes, [...] "she needs to humiliate Beebo so badly that she makes her disappear". Loewenstein remarks Bannon's characters are deeply conflicted by enjoying relationships they feel are morally wrong, and they are acting out cycles of self-hatred, though what remains at the end is [...] "surprisingly... passionate, tender, and erotic".|$|E
