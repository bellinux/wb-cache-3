5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} hold the games at the Shenton Park Annexe of the Royal Perth Hospital but this was abandoned due the need for temporary buildings. The Royal Agricultural Showgrounds in the suburb of Claremont was used as it had an oval and buildings for accommodation and events. A major advantage of the venue was that all facilities were <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>level.</b> There was no suitable facility for basketball and after much debate a wooden court was laid on a sand foundation {{in front of the}} main grandstand. Beatty Park was used for swimming events.|$|E
5|$|Two main {{aspects of}} adult {{attachment}} have been studied. The organization {{and stability of}} the mental working models that underlie the attachment styles is explored by social psychologists interested in romantic attachment. Developmental psychologists interested in the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment generally explore how attachment functions in relationship dynamics and impacts relationship outcomes. The organization of mental working models is more stable while the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment fluctuates more. Some authors have suggested that adults do not hold a single set of working models. Instead, <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>level</b> they {{have a set of}} rules and assumptions about attachment relationships in general. On another level they hold information about specific relationships or relationship events. Information at different levels need not be consistent. Individuals can therefore hold different internal working models for different relationships.|$|E

25|$|In {{the context}} of ritual magic and esotericism, an {{initiation}} is considered to cause a fundamental process of change to begin within the person being initiated. The person conducting the initiation (the initiator), being {{in possession of a}} certain power or state of being, transfers this power or state to the person being initiated. Thus the concept of initiation {{is similar to that of}} apostolic succession. The initiation process is often likened to a simultaneous death and rebirth, because as well as being a beginning it also implies an ending as existence <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>level</b> drops away in an ascension to the next.|$|E

Its front door (on the south) and the porthole-like windows (all on the west) opened onto Bag End's lawns and gardens, the Party Field, and the distant countryside beyond.

Over {{the course of the next}} few years, the area to the east of the new station, the Bahnhofsviertel, was built; it was completed around 1900. Until the completion of Leipzig Hauptbahnhof in 1915, Frankfurt station was the largest in Europe.

Latin American businesses were surveyed about their motivations for acting sustainably and any sustainability actions undertaken. Based on their responses, TwoStep cluster analysis found four clusters (cost, legitimisation, biospheric, and lifestyle). Acceptance of responsibility to be more sustainable depends <b>on</b> <b>one’s</b> <b>level</b> of empathy with, and attachment to, sustainability, explained by a beneficiary focus (personal norms that drive one to act to help oneself or others) and a cultural focus (acting in response to individualistic or collectivistic social norms).

25|$|<b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>level,</b> {{the show}} is a {{conventional}} family drama, dealing with such issues as interpersonal relationships, infidelity, and religion. At the same time, {{the show is}} distinguished by its unblinking focus {{on the topic of}} death, which it explores on multiple levels (personal, religious, and philosophical). Each episode begins with a death – the cause of which ranges from heart attack or murder to sudden infant death syndrome – and that death usually sets the thematic tone for each episode, allowing the characters to reflect on their current fortunes and misfortunes {{in a way that is}} illuminated by the death and its aftermath. The show also utilises dark humor and surrealism running throughout.|$|E

The father, she confesses furiously, is the girl's first cousin, Santino, the son of Pirrone and Sarina's paternal uncle. Father Pirrone ponders the long-standing family feud between Pirrone's father and his uncle. After saying Mass, he goes to visit his uncle and manipulates both him and Santino into accepting what he proposes as the terms of marriage. Back home, Father Pirrone persuades Angelina's grudging father into agreeing {{to the terms of}} marriage by sacrificing his own inheritance. Santino and his father arrive; the marriage is contracted, and the young people are happy. Later, while travelling back to the Salina Palace, Father Pirrone is certain that Santino and his father planned Angelina's seduction so they could get their hands on property they believed was rightfully theirs, and also realizes that the nobility and the peasants are, at least <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>level,</b> far more similar than he once thought.|$|E

5000|$|This term [...] "consequences" [...] as {{the result}} of one's religiousness first {{appeared}} in Charles Y. Glock's five-dimensional religiosity measure. In the 1960s, Glock attempted to categorize the components of religiosity. In his five-dimensional scheme [...] "consequences" [...] are listed as the final dimension of religiosity. Glock theorized that certain consequences in a person's life can be attributed to religious living. Consequences of religiosity may include emotional and physical health, spiritual well-being, personal, marital, and family happiness. This, however, does not preclude the possibility of these factors working in the reverse as health, happiness and the like may interact with and have an influence <b>on</b> <b>one's</b> <b>level</b> of religiosity.|$|R

500|$|Critics have {{analyzed}} Alien sexual overtones. Following Barbara Creed's {{analysis of}} the Alien creature as {{a representation of the}} [...] "monstrous-feminine as archaic mother", Ximena Gallardo C. and C. Jason Smith compared the facehugger's attack on Kane to a male rape and the chestburster scene to a form of violent birth, noting that the Alien's phallic head and method of killing the crew members add to the sexual imagery. Dan O'Bannon, who wrote the film's screenplay, has argued that the scene is a metaphor for the male fear of penetration, and that the [...] "oral invasion" [...] of Kane by the facehugger functions as [...] "payback" [...] for the many horror films in which sexually vulnerable women are attacked by male monsters. McIntee claims that [...] "Alien is a rape movie as much as Straw Dogs (1971) or I Spit on Your Grave (1978), or The Accused (1988). <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>level</b> it's about an intriguing alien threat. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>level</b> it's about parasitism and disease. And on the level that was most important to the writers and director, it's about sex, and reproduction by non-consensual means. And it's about this happening to a man." [...] He notes how the film plays on men's fear and misunderstanding of pregnancy and childbirth, while also giving women a glimpse into these fears.|$|E
