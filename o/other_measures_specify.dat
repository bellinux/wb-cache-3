5000|$|Mitigation {{measures}} included: [...] "temporary {{reductions of}} Internet speeds, redirection to a landing page until the subscriber contacts the ISP {{to discuss the}} matter or reviews and responds to some educational information about copyright, or <b>other</b> <b>measures</b> (as <b>specified</b> in published policies) that the ISP may deem necessary to help resolve the matter". Mitigation measures varied by company. Verizon was the first to reveal their mitigation policy. Their policy specified that violators with more than three alerts would be directed to an online copyright law information. Upon a fifth or sixth alert, the user would experience a temporary speed reduction down to 256kbit/s (approximately the speed of dial-up internet access). According to a leaked internal document, AT&T decided that after a 6th alert, a user's [...] "access to many of the most frequently visited websites be restricted" [...] until they completed an [...] "online educational tutorial on copyright". However, AT&T later explained that it would not cut the user off the internet even though such measure appeared in the copyright warning letter. It gave a reason that the six strikes warnings are only allegations; therefore, if the alleged user was still suspected of illegal downloading after completion of the [...] "online educational tutorial on copyright" [...] and the six strikes warnings, unless the copyright owner took legal action; nothing would happen. Time Warner Cable stated that it would not discontinue customers' service, but instead redirect users to educational pages on copyright law upon multiple violations.|$|R

Compliance with non (ne) bis in idem {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} legal {{principles}} of European law. Its compliance in criminal law of Ukraine is an indicator of correspondence of this area to the generally recognized principles and norms of international law and international standards of human rights protection. However, legal regulation of this principle in criminal law of Ukraine and its understanding by the domestic theory of criminal law should be improved. The objective of the publication is to determine the ways of guaranteeing the establishment of two legal systems ? international and national while consolidation practical implementation of the principle of non bis in idem. The research is conducted with the usage of comparative and legal method and system and structural analysis. Genetic relations of the principle non bis in idem with major international legal acts that define standards of human rights protection (European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) and international treaties of criminal and legal character (Roman Statute of the International Criminal Court, the European Convention on the International Validity of Criminal Judgments, etc.) are provided. Shortcomings in the regulation of this principle in the P. 3. of the Art. 2 and P. 2 of the Art. 7 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine are revealed; the estimation of their provisions that duplicate each other is provided. It is indicated that the action of this principle in the criminal legislation of Ukraine is not extended to persons stated in the Art. 8 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. It is offered to state the appropriate provision in the form of a certain norm, which would be included into the complex of requirements about the validity of the law on criminal liability in the space. It is proved that the prohibition of re-application of the measures of criminal and legal character for the same offence is within the national criminal and legal jurisdiction. Therefore, the state has the right without violating international human rights standards to provide the possibility of using its own criminal law to a person, who has suffered punishment for the offence beyond its territory. A formula of the principle of non bis in idem considering the peculiarities of the system of measures of criminal and legal character, which is regulated by the Criminal Code of Ukraine, as a formulation ?No one in Ukraine can experience criminal liability or <b>other</b> <b>measures</b> <b>specified</b> by the Criminal Code of Ukraine for the same offence more than once? is offered. ??????????? ?????????? ???????? n?n bis in idem ? ????????? ????? ???????. ???????? ??? ???????????? ????? ? ????????? ????????????-????????? ??????, ????????????? ????????? ?????? ???? ????????. ???????? ?????????? ????????????? ??????? ???????? ? ????????? ??????? ???????...|$|R
