40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research related to the impact of electric arc activation onto drive welding energy and metal weld heating speed. It is con-firmed that activated tungsten inert <b>gas</b> <b>welding</b> and activated metal inert <b>gas</b> <b>welding</b> methods, depending on metal thickness, single pass weldability and chemical composition of activating flux, enable the reduction of welding energy by 2 - 6 times when compared to conventional welding methods. Additionally, the-se procedures create conditions to increase metal weld heating speed up to 1, 500 - 5, 500 °Cs – 1. Steel which can be rapidly heated, allows for a hardened structure to form (with carbon content up to 0. 4 %), together with a released mar-tensitic structure or a mixture of bainitic-martensitic structures.
