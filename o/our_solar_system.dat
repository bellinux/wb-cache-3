5|$|Although no {{supernova}} {{has been}} observed in the Milky Way since 1604, it appears that a supernova exploded in the constellation Cassiopeia about 300 years ago, around the year 1667 or 1680.

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{possibility is}} that 55 Cancri e is a solid planet made of carbon-rich material rather than the oxygen-rich material that makes up the terrestrial planets in <b>our</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> In this case, roughly {{a third of the}} planet's mass would be carbon, much of which may be in the form of diamond {{as a result of the}} temperatures and pressures in the planet's interior.

5|$|The new {{research}} suggests that the rocky centres of super-Earths are unlikely to evolve into terrestrial rocky planets like the inner planets of <b>our</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> because they appear to hold on to their large atmospheres.

5|$|Further {{observational}} improvements led to {{the realization}} that <b>our</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> is located in the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies in the Universe. It is assumed that galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center.

Astrophysical plasmas are also observed in Accretion disks around stars or compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes in close binary star systems. Plasma is associated with ejection of material in astrophysical jets, which have been observed with accreting black holes or in active galaxies like M87's jet that possibly extends out to 5,000 light-years.|$|E
5|$|This {{proved that}} the unknown {{radioactive}} source originated from the decay of uranium and, coupled with the previous observation that the source was different chemically from all known elements, proved beyond all doubt that a new element had been discovered. McMillan and Abelson published their results in a paper entitled Radioactive Element 93 in the Physical Review on May 27, 1940. They did not propose {{a name for the}} element in the paper, but they soon decided on the name neptunium since Neptune is the next planet beyond Uranus in <b>our</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> McMillan and Abelson's success compared to Nishina and Kimura's near miss {{can be attributed to the}} favorable half-life of 239Np for radiochemical analysis and quick decay of 239U, in contrast to the slower decay of 237U and extremely long half-life of 237Np.|$|E

Zeta Corvi marks the raven's neck. It is of apparent magnitude 5.21, separated by 7 arcseconds from the star HR 4691. Located 420 ± 10 light-years distant, it is a blue-white Be star of spectral type B8V, the presence of hydrogen emission lines in its spectrum indicating it has a circumstellar disc. These stars may be an optical double or a true multiple star system, with a separation of at least 50,000 astronomical units and the stars taking 3.5 million years to orbit each other. HR 4691 is itself double, composed of an ageing yellow-orange giant whose spectral type has been calculated at K0 or G3, and an F-type main-sequence star.|$|E

40|$|Most debris disks {{resolved}} so far show extended structures {{located at}} tens to hundreds AU from the host star, {{and are more}} analogous to <b>our</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system's</b> dusty Kuiper belt than to the AU-scale zodiacal disk inside <b>our</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system's</b> asteroid belt.

The grain populations derived from these observations are quite intriguing, as they point towards very high dust replenishment rates, high cometary activity or major collisional events. In this talk, we review the ongoing efforts to detect bright exozodiacal disks with precision near-infrared interferometry in both hemispheres with CHARA/FLUOR and VLTI/PIONIER. We discuss preliminary statistical trends on the occurrence of bright exozodi around nearby main sequence stars and show how this information could be used to constrain the global architecture and evolution of debris disks...|$|R
