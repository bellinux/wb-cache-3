40|$|In {{the present}} study, we report {{the finding of}} high {{concentrations}} of D-Asp (D-aspartate) in the retina of the cephalopods Sepia officinalis, Loligo vulgaris and Octopus vulgaris. D-Asp increases in concentration in the retina and <b>optic</b> <b>lobes</b> as the animal develops. In neonatal S. officinalis, the concentration of D-Asp in the retina is 1. 8 ± 0. 2  μmol/g of tissue, and in the <b>optic</b> <b>lobes</b> it is 5. 5 ± 0. 4  μmol/g of tissue. In adult animals, D-Asp is found at a concentration of 3. 5 ± 0. 4  μmol/g in retina and 16. 2 ± 1. 5  μmol/g in <b>optic</b> <b>lobes</b> (1. 9 -fold increased in the retina, and 2. 9 -fold increased in the <b>optic</b> <b>lobes).</b> In the retina and <b>optic</b> <b>lobes</b> of S. officinalis, the concentration of D-Asp, L-Asp (L-aspartate) and L-Glu (L-glutamate) is significantly influenced by the light/dark environment. In adult animals left in the dark, these three amino acids fall significantly in concentration in both retina (approx.   25 % less) and <b>optic</b> <b>lobes</b> (approx.   20 % less) compared with the control animals (animals left in a diurnal/nocturnal physiological cycle). The reduction in concentration is in all cases statistically significant (P= 0. 01 – 0. 05).

However, special classes of transmedullary columnar neurons projecting to the lobula or to both lobula and lobula plate are not seen in the mutant. Some neurons linking the lobula complex to the central brain send branches to the medulla (the branches do not exist in wild type); some other types seem to be missing. The fate mapping of the KS 58 focus reveals a location ventral to the head bristles and in sine oculis (so) flies the mutation further reduces the rudiments of the <b>optic</b> <b>lobes</b> normally seen.

50|$|The Drosophila CNS is {{composed}} of two brain hemispheres and the ventral ganglion.

40|$|AbstractA {{big step}} in the {{neurobiology}} of Drosophila would be to establish a standard for brain anatomy to which to relate morphological, developmental and genetic data. We propose that only an average brain and its variance would be a biologically meaningful reference and have developed an averaging procedure. Here, we present a brief outline of this method {{and apply it to}} the <b>optic</b> <b>lobes</b> of Drosophila melanogaster wild-type Canton S. Whole adult brains are stained with a fluorescent neuropil marker and scanned with the confocal microscope. The resulting three-dimensional data sets are automatically aligned into a common coordinate system and intensity averages calculated. We use effect–size maps for the fast detection of differences between averages. For morphometric analysis, neuropil structures are labelled and superimposed to give a three-dimensional probabilistic map. In the present study, the method was applied to 66 <b>optic</b> <b>lobes.</b> We found their size, shape and position to be highly conserved between animals. Similarity was even higher between left and right <b>optic</b> <b>lobes</b> of the same animal. Sex differences were more pronounced. Female <b>optic</b> <b>lobes</b> were 6 % larger than those of males. This value corresponds well with the higher number of ommatidia in females. As females have their additional ommatidia dorsally and ventrally, the additional neuropil in the medulla, lobula and lobula plate, accordingly, was found preferentially at these locations. For males, additional neuropil was found only at the posterior margin of the lobula. This finding supports the notion of male-specific neural processing in the lobula as described for muscid and calliphorid flies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe adult <b>optic</b> <b>lobe</b> of Drosophila {{develops}} {{from the}} primordium during metamorphosis from mid- 3 rd larval stage to adult. Many cells die during {{development of the}} <b>optic</b> <b>lobe</b> with a peak {{of the number of}} dying cells at 24 h after puparium formation (h APF). Dying cells were observed in spatio-temporal specific clusters. Here, we analyzed the function of a component of the insect steroid hormone receptor, EcR, in this cell death. We examined expression patterns of two EcR isoforms, EcR-A and EcR-B 1, in the <b>optic</b> <b>lobe.</b> Expression of each isoform altered during development in isoform-specific manner. EcR-B 1 was not expressed in <b>optic</b> <b>lobe</b> neurons from 0 to 6 h APF, but was expressed between 9 and 48 h APF and then disappeared by 60 h APF. In each cortex, its expression was stronger in older glia-ensheathed neurons than in younger ones. EcR-B 1 was also expressed in some types of glia. EcR-A was expressed in <b>optic</b> <b>lobe</b> neurons and many types of glia from 0 to 60 h APF in a different pattern from EcR-B 1. Then, we genetically analyzed EcR function in the <b>optic</b> <b>lobe</b> cell death. At 0 h APF, the <b>optic</b> <b>lobe</b> cell death was independent of any EcR isoforms. In contrast, EcR-B 1 was required for most <b>optic</b> <b>lobe</b> cell death after 24 h APF. It was suggested that cell death cell-autonomously required EcR-B 1 expressed after puparium formation. βFTZ-F 1 was also involved in cell death in many dying-cell clusters, but not in some of them at 24 h APF. Altogether, the <b>optic</b> <b>lobe</b> cell death occurred in ecdysone-independent manner at prepupal stage and ecdysone-dependent manner after 24 h APF. The acquisition of ecdysone-dependence was not directly correlated with the initiation or increase of EcR-B 1 expression...|$|E

It seems reasonable to assume that mutants which strongly affect development of the imaginal-specific central nervous system may evidence abnormalities during the late larval or pupal stages when the adult central nervous system is undergoing final assembly and might show a lethal phase prior to eclosion (as is true for mutations at the previously defined l(1) ogre locus).

To correlate observed behavioral changes within the brain structure along {{the development of this}} animal, optic lobes from the late embryonic stage to adulthood were examined systematically in the present study. The MRI scan revealed that the so called “cell islands” in the medulla of the cephalopod's <b>optic</b> <b>lobe</b> (Young, 1962, 1974) are in fact a contiguous tree-like structure. Quantification of the neural organizational development of optic lobes showed that structural features of the cortex and radial column zone were established earlier than those of the tangential zone during embryonic and post-hatching stages. Within the cell islands, the density of nuclei was decreased while the size of nuclei was increased during the development. Furthermore, the visual processing area in the <b>optic</b> <b>lobe</b> showed a significant variation in lateralization during embryonic and juvenile stages.

The oval squid Sepioteuthis lessoniana has relatively large optic lobes that are responsible for visual communication via dynamic body patterning. It has been observed that the visual behaviors of oval squids change as the animals mature, yet little is known about how the structure of the optic lobes changes during development. The aim {{of the present study was}} to characterize the ontogenetic changes in neural organization of the optic lobes of S. lessoniana from late embryonic stage to adulthood. Magnetic resonance imaging and micro-CT scans were acquired to reconstruct the 3 D-structure of the optic lobes and examine the external morphology at different developmental stages. In addition, <b>optic</b> <b>lobe</b> slices with nuclear staining were used to reveal changes in the internal morphology throughout development. As oval squids mature, the proportion of the brain making up the optic lobes increases continuously, and the optic lobes appear to have a prominent dent on the ventrolateral side.
