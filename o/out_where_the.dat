The image of the model was cut out of the photographic print and mounted on glass and filmed on an animation stand. The undeveloped film was re-wound to film the star background with the silhouette of the model photograph acting as a matte to block <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> spaceship image was.|$|E

Alternatively, there is a secret idol in Wave 8 that will reveal the hidden exit. To pass {{requires the}} use of both TNT and the Sankara Stones. Wave 11 leads to the exit and Wave 12 recreates the scene with the rope bridge and the final battle with Mola Ram.|$|E
5|$|When writing material, {{the band}} would write the music first before {{incorporating}} lyrics. King or Hanneman used a 24-track and drum machine to show band members the riff that they created, {{and to get}} their opinion. Either King, Hanneman or Lombardo would mention if any alterations could be made. The band played the riff to get the basic song structure, and figured <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> lyrics and solos would be placed. Hanneman, King and Araya tended to have different lyrical influences. Hanneman's lyrics dealt with Nazis, religion, warfare and similar topics; King's lyrics are generally anti-religious; Araya's lyrics usually dealt with topics {{that could be considered}} less controversial than Hanneman's and King's, such as serial killers and warfare.|$|E

5|$|After finding <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Ning-Po unloaded, Bond flies {{over the}} area in a heavily armed {{autogyro}} created by Q. Near a volcano, Bond is attacked by helicopters, which he defeats, confirming his suspicions that the enemy's base is nearby. A Soviet spacecraft is then captured in orbit by another unidentified craft, heightening tensions between Russia and the United States. The mysterious spaceship lands in an extensive base hidden inside the volcano. It soon {{turns out that the}} true mastermind behind this is SPECTRE, whose mysterious leader is revealed to be Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who has been hired by the People's Republic of China to start a Soviet-American war. Blofeld summons Osato for not having killed Bond, who immediately blames his assistant, Helga Brandt. Blofeld then gives Osato a last chance, but as Brandt leaves, he activates a mechanism that drops her into a pool filled of piranhas. Brandt is forced to pay for her failure with her life by being devoured alive, and Blofeld instructs Osato to kill Bond.|$|E
5|$|However, she {{is being}} {{followed}} by a gang, led by a furious Telugu-speaking lady. Shiva manages to lose the pursuers and decides to change the route to avoid the gang, but encounters a second gang. He realises that this gang is not following Charulatha, but himself, as they are the henchmen of a Mumbai-based gangster Baali (Milind Soman). He recalls an incident that happened some years ago in Mumbai, when he stayed there at his friend Poochi's (Jagan) house. He had beaten one of Baali's men, who had attacked him, and later Baali himself, not knowing about him and his reputation in the city, and returned to Bangalore. Both gangs are following the couple to achieve their own ends. After reaching Mumbai and experiencing a series of events, they end up at Poochi's house. Poochi finds <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> grandmother lives and Shiva brings Charulatha there. Shiva, unable to bear {{the thought that the}} journey is complete, leaves silently only to find Charulatha on the road. After hesitating, she reveals that her relatives had spoken ill about her parents, which prompted her leave, not wanting to push the matter further. While in a state of doubt, they are attacked by Baali's gang, who have teamed up with Jayaraman.|$|E
5|$|Logan and Mac {{continue}} to make progress on his business school report, but Mac has to call Max (Adam Rose) to continue. Desmond goes skinny dipping at his party, while Mac and Max flirt in front of Logan. Veronica discovers that Desmond’s bag was actually switched with another person’s. Veronica and Piz retrieve it, and on the car ride home, they briefly discuss their kiss at the party before playing a CD with some of Desmond’s unreleased newer material. Keith reconnects with Leo D’Amato (Max Greenfield), who presents a case involving the Fitzpatricks to him. They stake <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Fitzpatricks are, and Keith sees Vinnie Van Lowe helping them. However, they quickly learn that Vinnie is actually investigating the case and has trapped them in the store. Veronica and Piz supposedly get stuck in traffic and tell Desmond to play some of his newer songs until they get there, but they actually are at the concert venue and just want him to expose the audience to his solo material.|$|E

5|$|The {{setting was}} principally based on Norway, and the {{cultural}} influences in the film come from Scandinavian culture. Several landmarks in Norway appear in the film, including the Akershus Fortress in Oslo, the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, and Bryggen in Bergen. Numerous other typical cultural Scandinavian elements are {{also included in the}} film, such as stave churches, trolls, Viking ships, a hot spring, Fjord horses, clothes, and food such as lutefisk. A maypole is also present in the film, as well as the brief appearance of runes in a book that Anna and Elsa's father opens to figure <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> trolls live. A scene where two men argue over whether to stack firewood bark up or bark down is a reference to the perennial Norwegian debate over how to stack firewood properly. The film also contains several elements specifically drawn from Sámi culture, such as the usage of reindeer for transportation and the equipment used to control these, clothing styles (the outfits of the ice cutters), and parts of the musical score. Decorations, such as those on the castle pillars and Kristoff's sled, are also in styles inspired by Sámi duodji decorations. During their field work in Norway, Disney's team, for inspiration, visited Rørosrein, a Sámi family-owned company in the village Plassje that produces reindeer meat and arranges tourist events. Arendelle was inspired by Nærøyfjord, a branch of Norway's longest fjord Sognefjorden, which has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; while a castle in Oslo with beautiful hand-painted patterns on all four walls served as the inspiration for the kingdom's royal castle interior.|$|E

25|$|Crawford's second {{first-class}} {{game after}} his debut in 1896 was a Gentlemen v Players match at Hastings {{at the end}} of the 1897 season when his captain was W. G. Grace. In 1898 and 1899, he appeared in around half of Surrey's first-class games and in the 1899 match against Somerset in which Surrey amassed a total of 811, he scored his first century with an innings of 129, although his effort was somewhat overshadowed by Bobby Abel's 357 not <b>out,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> diminutive opening batsman carried his bat.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, the {{internment}} facility {{had its own}} U.S. Army run {{hospital to}} serve detainees. It offered comprehensive healthcare. There was an emergency room, internal medicine clinic, optometry clinic, psychiatric services, orthopedic/surgical unit, physical therapy clinic, pharmacy, dental clinic, dietary services and more. Detainees were screened by medics and doctors at the wire, that was right <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> detainees are housed, and then triaged {{to the hospital for}} further care. Some detainees were flown to larger medical facilities in Iraq to receive cataract surgery. U.S. Army medical staff was also given training on how to provide care while respecting Muslim traditions.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} tool {{in this effort}} was HUD's first-ever Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress. This groundbreaking survey of homelessness found that 704,000 people nationwide sought shelter {{at least once in}} a three-month period. Through the data collection for the report, and the subsequent analysis of that data, HUD learned {{a great deal about the}} demographics of homelessness. Prior to the report,according to Jackson, HUD had a hard time figuring out if national or local programs were working and a tough time just trying to figure <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> homeless might be on a given night.|$|E
25|$|Besides the singing, the koledari also chased away demons {{from the}} household. First they searched {{the house to}} find <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> demons hide. They looked everywhere, {{at the same time}} shouting, dancing, jumping, {{knocking}} on the floor and walls with sticks, and teasing Bride. When they found the demons, they drove them out of the hiding place, and fought with them swinging their sabers and clubs. After the demons were chased away, the koledari briefly danced the kolo, and then blessed the household. As a reward, they received a loaf of bread which the family prepared specially for them, and other food gifts.|$|E

25|$|Meat {{often comes}} from hunting. Conservation groups are {{concerned}} that, {{with the rise}} in the human population, many animal species are in danger of extinction because of the trade in bushmeat. Chimpanzee, bonobo, wild boar, monkey, antelope, and other wild animals are often sold in the market or at impromptu stalls around the town. In 1998, Jeff Dupain and others catalogued the types of bushmeat available in the two main Basankusu markets; they interviewed the stallholders to find <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> animals were hunted. Many people keep livestock around the family home. Chickens, pigs, and, less frequently, sheep and goats provide fresh food and a source of income.|$|E
25|$|The Undertaker's next storyline {{began at}} the Royal Rumble in January 2002, when Maven {{eliminated}} him by hitting him with a dropkick from behind. Subsequently, The Undertaker eliminated Maven in return and brutally assaulted him backstage. On an episode of SmackDown!, The Rock mentioned The Undertaker's elimination at the Royal Rumble, angering Undertaker, who responded by costing The Rock the number one contendership for the Undisputed WWF Championship. The storyline continued when The Rock cost The Undertaker his match with Maven for the Hardcore Championship. The two faced off at No Way <b>Out,</b> <b>where</b> <b>The</b> Undertaker lost due to interference from Ric Flair. This interference began a storyline with Flair, who declined a challenge to wrestle Undertaker at WrestleMania X8 {{and as a result}} Undertaker assaulted his son David. Flair eventually accepted the match after The Undertaker threatened to inflict the same punishment on Flair's daughter. A no disqualification stipulation was added to the match, and The Undertaker defeated Flair.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{also took}} {{a series of steps}} to evade the embargo and clandestinely trade with the Arab world. Front {{companies}} in third countries were set up, which imported goods, then re-exported them to Arab countries with false labels and certificates of origin. In other cases, foreign companies would purchase Israeli technology and materials, use them to assemble completed products, and export them to Arab countries while concealing this fact from their customers. Arrangements with American companies were worked <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> American companies would buy goods from Israeli affiliates and export them as American-made goods. Israeli ships were re-flagged as ships of other nations and provided with faked bills of landing so they could directly export goods to the Arab and Muslim world. Greece and Cyprus were particularly popular hubs for smuggling Israeli goods into the Arab world due to their location, multilateral economic connections, large merchant fleets, and Cyprus' corporate and bank secrecy laws.|$|E
