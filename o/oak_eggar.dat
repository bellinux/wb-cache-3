5000|$|Like most tachinid flies, {{the female}} lays her eggs on other living insect larva, the fly larvae then develop inside the living host, devouring it and {{eventually}} killing it. Its main hosts are the large hairy Lepidopteran caterpillars, particularly the <b>Oak</b> <b>eggar</b> moth Lasiocampa quercus and Macrothylacia rubi.|$|E
40|$|Defensive fluids {{obtained}} from the Garden Tiger, Scarlet Tiger and Burnet Moths and from the Monarch Butterfly and the Seven-Spot Ladybird Beetle, haemolymphs taken from the wasp, the Burying Beetle and the Rat Flea, and fluids from the eggs of the Garden Tiger, Gypsy Moth and <b>Oak</b> <b>Eggar</b> Moth were examined in the electron microscope after negative staining. Except for the ladybird all the defensive fluids, haemolymphs and egg fluids contained particles 100 - 150 A across which frequently had rectangular or square outlines. In some species the particles were occasionally arranged in groups of 2 and 4 and in the egg fluid of the Garden Tiger they were arranged in rows which were aligned side by side to form strands of considerable length. The particles {{are believed to be}} protein. They correspond in size to the 16 s component of the haemocyanin 8 of Limulus and Homarus and the protein particles found in Calliphora by other workers...|$|E
