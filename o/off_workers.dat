5|$|Fiscal chaos, {{coupled with}} {{problems}} {{of transportation and}} the requisition of metal led to a general economic collapse as factories ran out of raw materials and laid <b>off</b> <b>workers.</b> The crisis especially afflicted Belgium's large manufacturing industries. As raw material usually imported from abroad dried up, more firms laid <b>off</b> <b>workers.</b> Unemployment became a major problem and increased reliance on charity distributed by civil institutions and organisations. As many as 650,000 people were unemployed between 1915 and 1918. The German authorities used the crisis to loot industrial machinery from Belgian factories, which was either sent to Germany intact or melted down. The policy escalated {{after the end of}} the German policy of deportation in 1917 which later created major problems for Belgian economic recovery {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Bell {{began to}} lay <b>off</b> <b>workers</b> on the V-22 {{production}} line following {{the implementation of}} defense cuts, which had reduced the US order to about half the originally planned number of aircraft.

The effects of the panic were quickly felt in New York, and more slowly in Chicago, Virginia City, Nevada, and San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|The Depression {{was a major}} blow to cigar manufacturers. Worldwide demand {{plummeted}} {{as consumers}} sought to cut costs by switching to less-expensive cigarettes, and factories responded by laying <b>off</b> <b>workers</b> or shutting down. This trend continued throughout the 1930s as the remaining cigar factories gradually switched from traditional hand-rolled manufacturing to cheaper mechanized methods, further {{reducing the number of}} jobs and the salaries paid to workers.|$|E
25|$|The lands were {{controlled}} by powerful families, while the labourers {{were from a}} Dalit community. In 1968, the agricultural labourers of unified Tanjore district formed a union seeking better working conditions and higher wages. To mark their union the workers hoisted red flags in their villages, irking their landlords. The landlords formed a separate union with yellow flags and started laying <b>off</b> <b>workers</b> belonging to the Communist unions.|$|E

25|$|As {{occurred}} elsewhere, {{many businesses}} laid <b>off</b> <b>workers</b> or closed altogether and many banks failed. To help keep {{food on the}} table during hard times, many residents of Ybor City plowed under their yards or vacant lots to plant vegetables and bought cows, goats, and chickens to provide milk, eggs, and meat for the family, with any surplus sold around town. Interestingly, the descendants of those chickens still roam the area.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, the Great Depression made matters worse. The {{economic}} collapse drove {{a number of}} New England and Mid-Atlantic manufacturers into bankruptcy, while those employers who survived laid <b>off</b> <b>workers</b> and increased the amount and pace of work for their employees even further. Textile workers across the region, from worsted workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts and silk weavers in Paterson, New Jersey, to cotton millhands in Greenville, South Carolina, engaged in hundreds of isolated strikes, {{even though there were}} thousands of unemployed workers desperate to take their places.|$|E
25|$|The late-2000s {{recession}} in the world, the near-concurrent local property bust with changes in Estonian legislation to increase labour market flexibility (making it easier for companies to lay <b>off</b> <b>workers)</b> saw Estonia's unemployment rate shoot up to 18.8% throughout {{the duration of the}} crisis, then stabilise to 13.8% by summer 2011, as the economy recovered on the basis of strong exports. Internal consumption, and therefore imports, plummeted; and cuts were made in public finances. Some of the reduction in unemployment has been attributed to some Estonians' emigrating for employment to Finland, the UK, Australia, and elsewhere.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{bankruptcy}} announcement, former employee Tony Bulchak filed a class-action {{lawsuit against the}} automaker, alleging that Coda laid <b>off</b> 125 <b>workers</b> in December 14, 2012, without giving them a 60-day notice.|$|R
25|$|Another reason {{minimum wage}} may not affect {{employment}} in certain industries {{is that the}} demand for the product the employees produce is highly inelastic. For example, if management is forced to increase wages, management can pass on the increase in wage to consumers {{in the form of}} higher prices. Since demand for the product is highly inelastic, consumers continue to buy the product at the higher price and so the manager is not forced to lay <b>off</b> <b>workers.</b> Economist Paul Krugman argues this explanation neglects to explain why the firm was not charging this higher price absent the minimum wage.|$|E
25|$|The Lackawanna Steel plant stopped {{most of its}} {{operations}} on October 15, 1982. The company laid <b>off</b> <b>workers</b> in waves before the final closure, and transferred many others. On the day the plant stopped most of {{its operations}}, more than 6,000 workers lost their jobs (most of them high-paying). The city of Lackawanna's 22,700 people faced extremely large tax increases just to maintain basic services, {{as the amount of}} taxes paid by Bethlehem Steel fell from 66 percent of the city's revenue to just 8 percent. In addition, the city owed the company more than $5 million in tax overcharges. The United Steelworkers later successfully sued Bethlehem Steel for prematurely terminating the fringe benefits of the laid-off steelworkers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the Panic of 1873, a bitter {{antagonism}} between workers and the leaders of industry developed. Immigration from Europe was underway, as was migration of rural workers into the cities, increasing competition for jobs and enabling companies to drive down wages and easily lay <b>off</b> <b>workers.</b> By 1877, 10 percent wage cuts, distrust of capitalists and poor working conditions led to workers conducting numerous railroad strikes that prevented the trains from moving, with spiraling effects {{in other parts of the}} economy. Suppressed by violence, workers continued to organize to try to improve their conditions. Management worked to break up such movements, and mainstream society and the Catholic Church feared labor organizing as signs of socialism. Tensions lingered well after the depression ended in 1878–79.|$|E

25|$|During World War I, Greenville {{served as}} a {{training}} camp center for Army recruits. After World War I commercial activity expanded with new movie theaters and department stores. The Mansion House was demolished and replaced with the Poinsett Hotel in 1925. The Great Depression hurt the economy of Greenville forcing mills to lay <b>off</b> <b>workers.</b> Furman University and the Greenville Women's College also struggled in the crippling economy forcing them to merge in 1933. The Textile Workers Strike of 1934 caused such an uproar {{in the city and}} surrounding mill towns that the National Guard had to subdue the chaos. The New Deal established Sirrine Stadium and a new Greenville High School. The Greenville Army Air Base was established in 1942 during World War II contributing to the further growth of Greenville.|$|E
25|$|Ivy City began a {{significant}} decline in 1953. American railroads, which until this time had used coal-fueled locomotives, began switching to diesel fuel or using overhead electrical wires for powering engines. By {{the end of}} the year, almost no coal-fed locomotives were using the Ivy City rail yard. Although coal-fueled engines required frequent refueling, a diesel train could go for as many as three days without needing more diesel fuel. Steam-powered locomotives required almost daily tune-up and repair, but diesel-fueled engines rarely did. Significant layoffs at the Ivy City Yard occurred, deeply affecting Ivy City itself were many of these workers lived. The eastern roundhouse and a number of tracks were demolished in early 1954, and by 1956 the coal wharf and ash pits were also gone. As the railroad laid <b>off</b> <b>workers,</b> Ivy City also declined as a neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|Few {{industrialists}} {{were prepared}} for the Wall Street Crash of October 1929. Though Studebaker's production and sales had been booming, the market collapsed and plans were laid for a new, small, low-cost car—the Rockne. However, times were too bad to sell even inexpensive cars. Within a year, the firm was cutting wages and laying <b>off</b> <b>workers.</b> Erskine maintained faith in the Rockne and rashly had the directors declare huge dividends in 1930 and 1931. He also acquired 95% of the White Motor Company's stock at an inflated price and in cash. By 1933, the banks were owed $6 million, though current assets exceeded that figure. On March 18, 1933, Studebaker entered receivership. Erskine was pushed out of the presidency {{in favor of more}} cost-conscious managers. Albert R. Erskine committed suicide on July 1, 1933, leaving it to successors Harold Vance and Paul Hoffman to deal with the problems.|$|E
