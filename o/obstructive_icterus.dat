40|$|Introduction. Renal {{dysfunction}} is one {{of complications}} in patients with <b>obstructive</b> <b>icterus.</b> It {{is important to recognize}} it early and take adequate measure to prevent its occurrence. One third of the patients with <b>obstructive</b> <b>icterus</b> have deterioration of renal function before surgical intervention. The aim of the research was to assess the renal dysfunction markers in patients with <b>obstructive</b> <b>icterus.</b> The following factors were examined: diuresis, urinary sodium concentration, sodium excretory fraction, urine osmolality, osmotic concentration index, creatinine concentration index and renal index of lesion. Material and methods. The study included 85 patients with <b>obstructive</b> <b>icterus</b> (50 patients before surgical intervention and 35 after surgical intervention) and 30 patients without icterus as a control group. The patients with normal renal function before the development of the disease were included. Results. Malignant etiology was present in 39 patients and benign in 46 patients of the examined group. The evaluation parameters of renal function were examined in all of the patients. Creatinine concentration index led to the greatest change in the coefficient value of an internal consistency, showing that it was the best renal function marker in the examined group of patients with icterus. The next one was the urinary osmolality, since its exclusion would lead to a decrease in the value of Cronbach α coefficient to 0. 06. Icterus and surgical intervention show statistically significant effects to change {{in the value of the}} markers of laboratory differentiation of renal function, observed as an entire set. Discussion and conclusion. The examination showed that the concentration clearances of creatinine and urine osmolality are the parameters which point to the probability of renal dysfunction occurrence in <b>obstructive</b> <b>icterus...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{orthotopic}} liver retransplantation (OLRT) in a patient who was suffering from rejection and graft failure after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The patient was a 32 -year old female who had diagnosed liver lesion – hepatic cirrhosis. Within two months, with presented condition as a terminal stage of her disease, she underwent the OLT and immunosuppressive postoperative management. Two months after the OLT, in the one-week period, the patient underwent two new operations because of <b>obstructive</b> <b>icterus</b> due to fulminant cholangitis and subhepatic abscess. In spite of this operative and conservative treatment the patient’s condition did not improve. Because of graft failure due to bile duct necrosis, she underwent an ORLT operation and her condition is satisfactory, till now. We confirmed that the overall impact of retransplatation persists because patients undergoing elective retransplatation have significantly better prognosis than those requiring an emergency operation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Obstructive</b> {{jaundice}} (<b>icterus)</b> was {{an emergency}} situation in gastroenterology. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was a nonsurgical approach to release obstruction, mostly in common bile duct. Nowadays, this procedure was become frequently used in daily practice, but several complications also emerging. One of the severe complication was Post-ERCP Pancreatitis (PEP). Since {{it has a}} high mortality and morbidity, and also reduce patient quality of life, several approaches {{have been developed to}} reduce its incidence. In general, approaches consist of patient identification, efficient procedure, until pharmacological agent prevention. Although there were still contradiction among these, careful approach should be considered for each patients for a better outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Context Signet ring cell {{carcinoma}} of the ampulla of Vater is extremely rare and only 12 cases have previously been described in the English language literature. We report a case of advanced signet ring {{cell carcinoma}} of the ampulla of Vater, with invasion of the duodenum and pancreas. Case report A 59 -year-old man presented at a local hospital with upper abdominal pain and <b>icterus.</b> <b>Obstructive</b> jaundice was diagnosed and he was referred to our hospital. Abdominal computed tomography showed dilatation of the common bile duct and the pancreatic duct. Duodenoscopy indicated an irregularly shaped erosion on the ampulla of Vater. Histological examination of a biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. Duodenography revealed irregularity of the second portion of the duodenum wall. The diagnosis was {{carcinoma of the}} ampulla of Vater, and a pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. The histopathological findings detected signet ring cell carcinoma. Conclusion Although several cases have been reported, the detailed clinicopathological features and prognosis are not clear. Additional reports are warranted...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{outbreak}} of extensive epidemic of hepatitis {{in the fall of}} 1951 in Okayama Prefecture, the members of our Clinic have been conducting comprehensive studies from the clinical, pathological, and etiological angles. As a part of these investigation detailed studies on the changes in the serum protein were made. Since it has been proved that the nature of cephalin-cholesterol test (CCF) stands in a very intimate relationship to the conditions of the protein bodies in the serum, it has been made a series of CCF chiefly on epidemic hepatitis, but simultaneously also on hepatic cirrhosis, <b>obstructive</b> <b>icterus,</b> and a few other diseases in order to obtain informations regarding the methods of determination, various changes caused by diseases, variation in different stages of diseases, and on the possible significance CCF has in prognosis. 1) Hanger's antigen used was that supplied by Sumitomo Chemical Company which was somewhat inferior in chemical purity and reacted too sensitively and reading made often confusing by precipitation when the test was carried out in the standard fashion. For this reason the author made it his practice to read the degree of clarity in the upper layer as standard for decision. Carried out in this fashion CCF estimated his method on 19 healthy persons showed negative result in all but one. 2) CCF made weekly on epidemic hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, <b>obstructive</b> <b>icterus,</b> serum hepatitis, etc., give a strongly positive result for epidemic hepatitis which appeared mickly and remained positive as long as a trace of hepatic functional disturbance was present. In hepatic cirrhosis the test was also strangely positive but in cholecystitis, serum hepatitis, and obstructive jaundice the positive reaction was not strong. 3) The results of hepatic functional examinations by Takata's, cobalt-hydrochloride, Gros's, Weltmann's, thymol precipitation reactions, bromsulphalen test, scarlet-red reacton, and cholin-esterase actvity test performed simultaneously with the CCF were practically parallel with one another. In the cases which failed to show conformity of results, observations of the clinical course revealed the act that in cases in which CCF was negative in spite postive by other hepatic functional test the superven clinical course was improved in the majority. For this reason it was presumed that if the results CCF becomes negative the prognosis was considered probably favorable...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Common {{bile duct}} calculi {{represent}} a pathologic entity involving <b>obstructive</b> <b>icterus,</b> cholangitis, hepatic cirrhosis or pancreatitis. Common bile duct calculi mostly have a secondary origin (from gallbladder) in 95 % of cases, while primary choledocholithiasis is rare. Classification From surgical aspect, {{common bile duct}} calculi can be: 1. Asymptomatic, without manifested symptoms or signs, 2. Mobile, with intermittent biliar obstruction and disobstruction, 3. Fixed, with obstruction and signs of hepato-biliary and/or bilio-pancreatic duct, 4. Transitory, microcalculi which pass through Vater's Papilla by propulsion into duodenum with symptoms. Discussion Modern biliary surgery includes diagnosis of common bile duct calculi, and if possible preoperative endoscopic (endoluminal) surgery, which is less invasive for patients. If such approach is not possible, {{it is necessary to}} perform stone extraction and cholecystectomy. Conclusion Common bile duct calculi represent a common disease of the digestive system. Endoscopic diagnostic procedure is very important in management of choledocholithiasis Endoscopic treatment of common bile duct calculi prior to cholecystectomy is a method of choice and a strategy for associated cholecysto-choledocholithiasis...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Autoimmune {{pancreatitis}} is {{a disease}} associated with autoimmune mechanisms, clinically manifested mostly as <b>obstructive</b> <b>icterus</b> with or with no entire or partial enlargement of the pancreas, histological lymphoplas-mocytic infiltration, fibrosis or granulocytic epithelial lesions with a favourable therapeutic response to the application of corticosteroids. Type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis is a systemic disease befalling the group of IgG 4 -related diseases in contrast to type 2 which is specific for pancreas disease. Case report. We presented two cases. The first one was a 64 -year-old male patient with autoimmune pancreatitis complaining of abdominal pain, weight loss, weakness and exhaustion. Clinical examination showed a rare IgG 4 autoimmune pancreatitis. The second one was a 37 -year-old male patient complaining of abdominal pain with diarrhea. The diagnosis made revealed the presence of type 2 autoimmune pancreatitis. Following the diagnosis, immunosuppressive therapy was administered to both patients leading to the improvement of their general condition. Conclusion. Autoimmune pancreatitis is a rare disease, sometimes not easy to differ from pancreatic tumor or bile duct tumor with poor prognosis. Thus, early recognition of the disease is very important, since adequate treatment significantly increases the course and the outcomes of the disease...|$|E
40|$|History and Objectives: Due to {{prevalence}} of biliary tract and pancreatic disease and their known {{side effects and}} questionable surgical treatment, diagnostic value of ERCP and PTC, various discrepancies on the diagnostic values of these two methods, the present investigation was carried out on patients referred to Ayatollah Taleghani hospital in 1995. Materials and Methods: A diagnostic clinical trial was performed on 44 patients with <b>obstructive</b> <b>icterus</b> and indication for surgery. Patient's consent was obtained. Patient's profile including age, sex, ERCP, PTC findings were recorded (Form No. 1). Surgical observation, pathological data as the etiology of the disease was collected in a double blind manner and recorded in form No. 2. Data were classified and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and usefulness was determined. Results: Patients were in 25 - 80 (Mean 55) age range (Female 45. 5, male 54. 5). 70 were referred with icterus and RUQ pain. Sensitivity, specificity and usefulness of ERCP were 84, 100 and 84 respectively. The data for PTC were 90, 100 and 90 respectively. Conclusion: Performing ERCP and PTC and can be beneficial to the diagnosis of the disease. In case of obstructive biliary tract PTC (Due to simplicity) is recommended. Further research into diagnostic efficacy of these two methods is needed. Etiologic study on pancreatic diseases and biliary diseases is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Background: Neonatal {{cholestasis}} is {{an important}} disease of the liver and biliary ducts in infancy. In neglected cases, the disease has irreversible complications. Idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, biliary atresia, TORCH infections and choledochal cyst are important causes of neonatal cholestasis. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the causes of cholestasis among neonates admitted to the Children’s Medical Center of Tehran University. Methods: This is a descriptive, retrospective study including 109 patients diagnosed with <b>obstructive</b> <b>icterus,</b> from 1994 to 2001. With data collected from hospital records, the inclusion criteria consisted of cholestasis with a conjugated bilirubin of up to 2 mg/dl from at least two laboratory samples (20 % of total bilirubin). The definitive diagnosis of cholestasis included the laboratory investigations, which were in the patients’ hospital records and documented by their physicians. Results: Our patients (63 males and 46 females) had a mean age of 40 ± 6 days. The most common clinical findings were icterus, acholic stool and hepatosplenomegaly. The most common cause of cholestasis was idiopathic neonatal hepatitis followed by biliary atresia, which together caused 75 % of all the cases in this study. Conclusions: In our general population, the most common causes of neonatal cholestasis are hepatitis and biliary atresia. In other investigations, the etiology of neonatal cholestasis was different than that of this study. Because the number of different disorders presenting with cholestasis may be greater during the neonatal stage than at any other time of life, early diagnosis and treatment is very important for improved prognosis...|$|E
40|$|This {{study in}} an {{amplification}} {{of the preceding}} report "the object being to trace {{the changes in the}} behaviour of serum protein in epidemic hepatitis and to classify a possible relationship between the serum protein picture and the serum colloidal reaction". For this purpose the author has estimated the serum protein for each week of illness and conducted simultaneously Takata's and cobalt hydrochloride reaction, Gros's, CCF, thymol turbidity tests, etc. For estimation of the serum protein value has been used Pulfrich's dipping refractometer; for protein fragments electrophoresis and Yosikawa-Saito’s sulphurous soda’s salt-out method. In acute hepatitis albumin and A/G was reduced from the onset. A little later on α-globulin and still later β-globulin were reduced. γ-Globulin increase appeared at an early stage and remained increased through the entire course of the illness. Its prolonged increase may be considered as a sign of transition to chronic hepatitis. In chronic hepatitis the γ-globulin increase was definite and long standing, the albumin’s decrease in protein content was insignificant. Changes found in recurrence of hepatitis were similar to these in the acute stage. The above findings have confirmed the general ideas of Rossle-Eppinger’s serous inflammation. Concerning the interrelationship between the protein picture and the results of the hepatic functional tests the following facts were found. Takata's reaction………albumin decreased, α- and γ-Globulin increased. Weltmann's reaction………albumin decreased. Cobalt-hydrochloride reaction……α- and β-globulin increased. Gros's reaction………albumin decreased, and globulin increased. Thymol turbidity test………albumin decreased, β-and α-globulin increased. Scarlet red test………γ-globulin increased. C. C. F. ………γ-globulin increased. Thus especially close relationship between various reactions and tests and the protein fragments was demostrated. However, these changes in the serum protein picture cannot at once be considered to constitute the nature of these colloidal reactions. In hepatic cirrhosis the decrease in albumin and increase in γ-globulin were more marked than in hepatitis. In <b>obstructive</b> <b>icterus</b> β-globulin increase was more pronounced than in hepatitis...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. During choledocholitiasis {{inflammatory}} oxidant stress {{involves the}} promotion of mitochondrial dysfunction through an intracellular oxidant stress in hepatocytes leading mainly to necrosis and less to apoptosis. The product of oxidative stress, malondialdehyde (MDA), is extremely cytotoxic and damages cell membranes and intracellular macromolecules. The toxicity of MDA is based {{on its ability to}} act as a mutagenic agent in a cell. Therefore, the aim of this prospective study was to establish correlation of the parameters of inflammation and biochemical markers of cholestasis with the intensity of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of liver function disorders. Methods. Seventy adult subjects of either sex included in the study were devided into two groups: I - 40 patients with <b>obstructive</b> <b>icterus</b> caused by choledocholithiasis, and II - 30 healthy individuals. All the participants were subjected to a clinical, laboratory and ultrasonic check-up at the Internal Department of the Military Hospital in Niš. The parameters of oxidative stress: MDA, a measure of lipid peroxidation, and inflammation parameters: C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, albumins, number of leukocytes (Leu), granulocytes (Gr), lymphocytes (Ly) and monocytes (Mo) and biochemical markers of cholestasis: activity of γ-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) enzymes, the level of total, direct and indirect bilirubin were determined by standard biochemical methods. Results. Lower values of albumin (p < 0. 001), and significantly higher values of fibrinogen (p < 0. 05) and CRP (p < 0. 001) were found in the blood of the patients with cholestasis due to choledocholithiasis in relation to the controls. Significantly higher values of Leu (p < 0. 01) and Gr (p < 0. 001) with decreasing number of Ly (p < 0. 001) and Mo (p < 0. 001) were found in blood of the patients with cholestasis due to choledocholithiasis in relation to the control. Similarly, higher values of γ-GT, and AP (p < 0. 001), as well as the level of total, direct and indirect bilirubin (p < 0. 001) were found in blood of the patients with cholestasis due to choledocholithiasis in relation to the controls. The concentration of MDA (p < 0. 001) was increased in the patients with choledocholithiasis in relation to the controls. There was a significant positive linear correlation of the number of leukocytes (r = 0. 51, p < 0. 05) and the concentration of total (r = 0. 87, p < 0. 01), direct (r = 0. 85, p < 0. 01) and indirect (r = 0. 88, p < 0. 01) bilirubin with the concentration of MDA in the group of patients with choledocholithiasis. Conclusion. Neutrophils and the levels of total, direct and indirect bilirubin have a significant positive linear correlation with the level of lipid peroxidation in patients with choledocholithiasis. Neutrophilia and hiperbilirubinemia observed in this way represent important parameters in estimating the level of liver tissue damage in choledocholithiasis...|$|E
