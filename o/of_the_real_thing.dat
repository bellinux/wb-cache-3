25|$|In 1911, she and {{her company}} staged 60 {{performances}} of Catherine Chisholm Cushing's comedy The Real Thing at the Maxine Elliott Theatre in New York, before taking the show on the road.

25|$|The 1936 {{race was}} {{spectacular}} for the crashes that it produced, {{because for the}} first time riders were required to negotiate everyday winding streets rather than the smooth bends of a motor-racing course. Stallard finished 17th and inspired by what he had ridden. There were more races on car circuits and airfields – Stallard won the last race at Brooklands, in 1939 – but to Stallard they were just a shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E

30|$|Plato {{believed}} the objects are reflecting {{to us in}} this world the same as shadows, we are entrapped as prisoners in a cave and only we can see <b>the</b> shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> objects on <b>the</b> wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cave because <b>of</b> a fire out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cave but {{we should try to}} get to <b>the</b> perfect form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>things</b> by leaving <b>the</b> cave.|$|R
30|$|The {{situation}} is a bit comparable to Plato’s allegory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cave, where Socrates compares <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> gaining knowledge with looking at <b>the</b> shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>things.</b> <b>The</b> observations ŷ are <b>the</b> “shadows” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “real” things q and υ̃, and from observing the “shadows” ŷ we want to infer what “reality” is, in a way turning our heads towards it. We hence want to “free” ourselves from just observing the “shadows” and gain some understanding of “reality”.|$|R
25|$|T.V. Boardman, Ltd., was {{but one of}} many London {{publishing}} houses {{turning out}} both paperback and hardcover books, pulp magazines, and comics. Boardman pioneered British reprinting of American comics. During the week of 16 October 1937, {{the first issue of}} a Boardman tabloid comic in the traditional British format, Okay Comics Weekly, arrived at newsagents all over England. The content was mostly American newspaper strips and the first issue sported a cover strip by Will Eisner. Okay lasted only until 26 February 1938, or a total of twenty issues. At about this same time, other British publishers experimented with reprinting American comics and imports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing</b> began to land on British shores. It rapidly became apparent that a significant British market for American comic books existed.|$|E

2500|$|Simulation of an algorithm: {{computer}} (computor) language: Knuth {{advises the}} reader that [...] "the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it [...] [...] [...] immediately take pen and paper and work through an example". But what about a simulation or execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing?</b> The programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that the simulator/computer/computor can effectively execute. Stone gives an example of this: when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computor must {{know how to take}} a square root.

2500|$|With the {{exception}} of the title theme, Fables music was composed by Russell Shaw, who had previously worked on Molyneux games such as Magic Carpet and Black & White. The job for composing Fables theme music was given to Danny Elfman. Elfman noted in an interview that Hollywood composers did not typically cross over to video game work, in part because many game developers wanted a synthesised score that sounds like an orchestra, instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing.</b> [...] At Elfman's insistence, the developers used a small orchestra, which Shaw noted was much more of a challenge than previous projects; [...] "There are more people involved (even without considering the orchestra), and the complexities of any music interactivity are brought to the fore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aside from [...] "A Small Victory" [...] (which {{received}} a nomination for Best Art Direction at the MTV Video Music Awards), the tracks [...] "Midlife Crisis" [...] and [...] "Everything's Ruined" [...] were also released as singles. The album included a re-recording {{of the theme}} to the film Midnight Cowboy, and later pressings included a cover of The Commodores classic [...] "Easy", which {{in some parts of}} the world became the band's biggest hit. Angel Dust, though not as successful as The Real Thing in the US, sold 665,000 copies there, and managed to outsell The Real Thing in many other countries. In Germany, the record was certified Gold for sales of more than 250,000 copies. The album also matched the sales <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Thing</b> in Canada (Platinum), Australia (Gold), and surpassed it in the Netherlands, France, Russia, and the UK.

2500|$|On most Jo-Han models, {{especially}} on friction models, chassis detail was often absent - which lowered tooling expense {{for a company}} not quite so large as AMT or the later MPC. Commonly, the chassis base was just an indented slab with the Jo-Han company name and [...] "Detroit, Michigan", but sometimes the company name was completely absent and only the GM or other car logo was present - emphasizing the real manufacturer instead of Jo-Han, the model maker. Some later contracts, however, added complete chassis detail {{as seen in the}} 1970 Ford Maverick, and the Cadillac Coupe DeVille and Eldorado promotionals from the later 1970s. On the 1965 and 1966 full sized Chrysler promos, Jo-Han outdid themselves by offering working torsion bars, but these were dropped for 1967 [...] Apart from the often plain chassis, models were exact duplicates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing</b> in 1/25 scale. Wheels also carried accurate detail, including authentic and official logos and scripts in hubcap centers.|$|E

[...] "I have {{made up my mind}} not to be cheated out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>things</b> that make one good and happy and, just because I'm a rich girl, fold my hands and drift as so many do.

5000|$|The English word [...] "form" [...] {{may be used}} to {{translate}} two distinct concepts that concerned Plato—the outward [...] "form" [...] or appearance of something, and [...] "Form" [...] in a new, technical nature, that never...assumes a form like that <b>of</b> any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> things which enter into her; ... But the forms which enter into and go out <b>of</b> her are <b>the</b> likenesses <b>of</b> <b>real</b> existences modelled after their patterns in a wonderful and inexplicable manner.... The objects that are seen, according to Plato, are not real, but literally mimic <b>the</b> <b>real</b> Forms. In <b>the</b> Allegory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cave expressed in Republic, the things that are ordinarily perceived in the world are characterized as shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>things,</b> which are not perceived directly.

40|$|What is a self? I {{will try}} to answer this {{question}} by developing an analogy with something much simpler, something which is nowhere near as puzzling as a self, but has some properties in common with selves. What I have in mind is <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> gravity of an object. This is a well-behaved concept in Newtonian physics. But a center of gravity is not an atom or a subatomic particle or any other physical item in the world. It has no mass; it has no color; it has no physical properties at all, except for spatio-temporal location. It is a fine example of what Hans Reichenbach would call an abstractum. It is a purely abstract object. It is, if you like, a theorist's fiction. It is not one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>things</b> in <b>the</b> universe in addition to the atoms. But it is a fiction that has nicely defined, well delineated and well behaved role within physics...|$|R
2500|$|After {{the release}} <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Thing,</b> Faith No More {{developed}} {{somewhat of a}} rivalry with fellow Californian funk rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, whom they had previously played with on The Uplift Mofo Party Tour. Singer Anthony Kiedis accused Mike Patton of stealing his [...] "style" [...] in the [...] "Epic" [...] music video. He told Kerrang! magazine [...] "My drummer says he’s gonna kidnap , shave his hair off and cut off one of his feet, just so he’ll be forced to find a style of his own". In a separate interview, he clarified his comment, remarking [...] "I love The Real Thing, and I liked his vocals on that record. I mean, when I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities, but when I saw that video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what the fuck?.'" [...] Roddy Bottum responded by saying [...] "To me, our band sounds nothing like Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you're talking about long hair, rapping with his shirt off, then yeah, I can see similarities. But beyond that, I can't see any. I haven't talked to them since this whole thing started. We're really good friends with that band and i'd like to think they're doing it... like as a favour". Mike Patton finally addressed the allegations from Kiedis in 1990, commenting that [...] "It just kind of {{came out of the}} blue. It doesn't bother me a bit. I got a real big kick out of it to tell you the truth. I mean, if he's gonna talk about me in interviews, that's fine - it's free press! Either he's feeling inadequate or old or I don't know, but I have no reason to talk shit about him." [...] Later in 2001, Patton also theorized that [...] "I think Anthony, deep down, feels like I'm a better dancer than he is. I think I shake my booty just a little bit fresher than he does. And if he would stop doing drugs I think he could outdance me. Maybe one day we'll have a breakoff, just breakdance." ...|$|E

60|$|In thus {{setting them}} down on paper, he works, I suppose, exactly as he would work from nature, only copying the remembered image in his mind, instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing.</b> He is, therefore, still {{nothing more than a}} copyist.

5000|$|In 1991, Rei {{began to}} record dance songs under <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Jamie Dee.

60|$|Take {{first the}} more obvious case of materialism. As an {{explanation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, materialism has {{a sort of}} insane simplicity. It has just <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> madman's argument; we have at once <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> it covering everything and <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> it leaving everything out. Contemplate some able and sincere materialist, as, for instance, Mr. McCabe, {{and you will have}} exactly this unique sensation. He understands everything, and everything does not seem worth understanding. His cosmos may be complete in every rivet and cog-wheel, but still his cosmos is smaller than our world. Somehow his scheme, like <b>the</b> lucid scheme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> madman, seems unconscious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alien energies and <b>the</b> large indifference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth; it is not thinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>things</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth, <b>of</b> fighting peoples or proud mothers, or first love or fear upon the sea.
