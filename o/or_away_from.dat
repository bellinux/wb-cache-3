The king also had Manatsara removed from Antananarivo to Ambohidrabiby.|$|E
5|$|Claiborne and Haw {{promoted}} Jesus for President {{by going}} on a U.S. speaking tour of 30 cities. The tour {{led up to the}} 2008 United States presidential election, and the book tour was suggestive of a third party candidate campaign for Jesus. The authors' speeches did not attempt to sway their audiences towards <b>or</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> any particular candidates, but rather encouraged them to endorse whichever candidates supported Christian values.|$|E

5|$|Decapitation was the {{preferred}} method in German and western Slavic areas, {{with the head}} buried between the feet, behind the buttocks <b>or</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the body. This act {{was seen as a}} way of hastening the departure of the soul, which in some cultures, was said to linger in the corpse. The vampire's head, body, or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising.|$|E
5|$|Fig.9 shows a doppler {{image of}} the solar corona made using a tunable Fabry-Pérot {{interferometer}} to recover scans of the solar corona {{at a number of}} wavelengths near the FeXIV green line. The picture is a color-coded {{image of the}} doppler shift of the line, which may be associated with the coronal plasma velocity towards <b>or</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the satellite camera.|$|E

They would also verify they were flying towards <b>or</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the station, by determining if the signal level (i.e. the audible tone volume) was getting stronger or weaker, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{fact that}} {{inflammation}} in DPB persists {{with or without}} the presence of P.aeruginosa and H.influenzae provides a means to determine several mechanisms of DPB pathogenesis. Leukotrienes are eicosanoids, signaling molecules made from essential fatty acids, which play a role in many lung diseases by causing the proliferation of inflammatory cells and excess mucus production in the airways. In DPB and other lung diseases, the predominant mediator of neutrophil-related inflammation is leukotriene B4, which specializes in neutrophil proliferation via chemotaxis (the movement of some types of cells toward <b>or</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> certain molecules).|$|E
5|$|The {{motion of}} a star {{relative}} to the Sun can provide useful information about the origin and age {{of a star}}, {{as well as the}} structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy. The components of motion of a star consist of the radial velocity toward <b>or</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Sun, and the traverse angular movement, which is called its proper motion.|$|E

5|$|By astronomical convention, {{the four}} seasons can be {{determined}} by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward <b>or</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Sun—and the equinoxes, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.|$|E
5|$|Integrity {{was laid}} down in September 1802 at the newly opened King's Dockyard in the colony of New South Wales. Governor Philip Gidley King ordered that {{construction}} proceed as swiftly as possible, {{in order to test}} the Dockyard's capacity. A team of two shipwrights, two apprentice shipwrights and two sawyers were assigned the task and delivered the finished cutter in thirteen months. During construction shipwright Thomas Moore tested that the hull was watertight by filling it with water from the inside, and repairing any visible leaks. Her hold also incorporated a partition that her crew could move to <b>or</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the forecastle bulkhead to vary her cargo capacity.|$|E
5|$|The marine {{artist and}} Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officer Norman Wilkinson, agreed with Kerr that dazzle's aim was {{confusion}} rather than concealment, but disagreed about {{the type of}} confusion to be sown in the enemy's mind. What Wilkinson {{wanted to do was}} to make it difficult for an enemy to estimate a ship's type, size, speed, and heading, and thereby confuse enemy ship commanders into taking mistaken or poor firing positions. An observer would find it difficult to know exactly whether the stern or the bow was in view; and it would be correspondingly difficult to estimate whether the observed vessel was moving towards <b>or</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the observer's position.|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} in Arizona are not common, {{since the}} predominant wind pattern steers most storms that {{form in the}} Eastern Pacific either parallel <b>or</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Pacific coast of northwestern Mexico. As a result, most storms that could affect Arizona are carried away from the United States, with only 6% of all Pacific hurricanes entering US territory. Not all Arizona hurricanes originate from the Pacific Ocean, however; in July 2008 an Atlantic hurricane named Hurricane Dolly produced rainfall in the eastern portion of the state, and another Atlantic storm reached Arizona as a tropical depression. Many, but not all, of these systems also impacted California.|$|E
5|$|Unless a star {{is being}} {{observed}} {{from the direction}} of its pole, sections of the surface have some amount of movement toward <b>or</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the observer. The component of movement that is {{in the direction of the}} observer is called the radial velocity. For the portion of the surface with a radial velocity component toward the observer, the radiation is shifted to a higher frequency because of Doppler shift. Likewise the region that has a component moving away from the observer is shifted to a lower frequency. When the absorption lines of a star are observed, this shift at each end of the spectrum causes the line to broaden. However, this broadening must be carefully separated from other effects that can increase the line width.|$|E
5|$|For {{stationary}} shots where Superman is seen flying toward <b>or</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the camera, {{blue screen}} matte techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap {{to give the}} illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be 'inserted' into a matted area of a background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would {{give the appearance of}} flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. The disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the matted image—in this case, Superman—do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.|$|E

5|$|In Diane's {{immediate}} aftermath, one of {{the first}} priorities in response was to distribute adequate inoculations for typhoid amongst the widespread areas left without clean drinking water. The United States Army assisted in search and rescue operations using helicopters. After the floods of Hurricane Diane, more than 100,000people fled to shelter <b>or</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> their houses. The American Red Cross quickly provided aid to the affected residents, using churches and public buildings to house homeless people. In the two weeks after the storm, Americans donated about $10million to the Red Cross. The countries of Great Britain, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, France, Austria, and Venezuela offered aid to help the flood victims, sending emergency supplies. Additional flooding affected New England in September and October 1955, although neither was as major as those caused by Hurricane Diane. Following Diane, hundreds of companies affected by the flooding installed waterproof doors and windows to preempt similar disasters in the future.|$|E
