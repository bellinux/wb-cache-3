5|$|Marshalsea or marshalcy {{referred}} to the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> marshal, derived from the Anglo-French mareschalcie. Marshal originally meant farrier, from the Old Germanic marh (horse) and scalc (servant), later a title bestowed on those presiding over the courts of Medieval Europe.|$|E
5|$|Regenbald first {{appears in}} the {{historical}} record in 1050, when he witnesses a charter of King Edward. King Edward gave him large estates {{as a reward for}} his service to the king as a royal chaplain. The Domesday Book records him owning at least seven churches, but only two of them have any indication that he performed any ecclesiastical services personally. Another royal reward was the grant to Regenbald of the status, without the actual <b>office,</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bishop. He probably was unable to be promoted to a bishopric, either because he was married or because his style of life was known to be unchaste.|$|E
5|$|The Office is a British sitcom {{that was}} {{originally}} broadcast by the BBC in the United Kingdom from 2001 to 2003. The television programme was created and written by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant; the former also played the main character, manager David Brent. The series {{is set in}} the Slough <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fictional paper merchant, Wernham Hogg, and is presented in a mockumentary format depicting the everyday lives of its employees.|$|E

5|$|He {{graduated}} from university in 1935, but {{upon his return}} to Sweden, he found his American degree did not qualify him to practice as an architect. Later that year, his grandfather arranged a job for him in Cape Town, South Africa, in the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Swedish company that sold construction material. After six months in South Africa, he took a new job at a branch office of the Holland Bank in Haifa. He returned to Sweden in 1936 and obtained a job in Stockholm {{with the help of}} his uncle and godfather, Jacob Wallenberg, at the Central European Trading Company, an export-import company trading between Stockholm and central Europe, owned by Kálmán Lauer, a Hungarian Jew.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 31 May 1810, Ernest, by his written account, was struck in the head several times while asleep in bed, {{awakening}} him. He ran for the door, where he was wounded in the leg by a sabre. He called for help, and one of his valets, Cornelius Neale, responded and aided him. Neale raised the alarm, and the household soon realised that Ernest's other valet, Joseph Sellis, was not among them, and that the door to Sellis's room was locked. The lock was forced, and Sellis was discovered with his throat freshly cut, a wound apparently self-inflicted. Ernest received several serious wounds during the apparent attack, and required over a month to recover from his injuries. The social reformer and anti-monarchist Francis Place managed to get on the inquest jury and became its foreman. Place went to the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> barrister friend to study inquest law, and aggressively questioned witnesses. Place also insisted the inquest be opened to the public and press, and so cowed the coroner that he basically ran the inquest himself. Nevertheless, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of suicide against Sellis.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{travelled}} by steamboat to Toronto (known until 1834 as York), {{where he}} passed an examination set by The Law Society of Upper Canada, including mathematics, Latin, and history. British North America had no law schools in 1830; students were examined when {{beginning and ending}} their tutelage. Between the two examinations, they were apprenticed, or articled to established lawyers. Macdonald began his apprenticeship with George Mackenzie, a prominent young lawyer who was a well-regarded member of Kingston's rising Scottish community. Mackenzie practised corporate law, a lucrative speciality that Macdonald himself would later pursue. Macdonald was a promising student, and {{in the summer of}} 1833, managed the Mackenzie office when his employer went on a business trip to Montreal and Quebec in Lower Canada (today the southern portion of the province of Quebec). Later that year, Macdonald was sent to manage the law <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Mackenzie cousin who had fallen ill.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Nemo {{is placed}} in a fish tank in the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dentist. He meets {{aquarium}} fish called the Tank Gang, led by Gill, a moorish idol. The fish learn that Nemo is {{to be given to}} the dentist's niece, Darla, who previously killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill then reveals his plan to escape, jamming the tank's filter with a pebble. The fish would be placed in plastic bags so that the dentist can clean the tank, and then they would roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam the filter, but fails, almost getting himself killed in the process. Near the harbor, a pelican, Nigel, flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's adventure. Inspired by his father's determination, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. Unlike the first attempt, he is able to successfully render the filter useless, but to the tank gang's dismay, the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{young woman}} named Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) begins a new career at Sterling Cooper as Don's secretary. She is excited {{to be working in}} Manhattan, but finds herself {{overwhelmed}} by her new surroundings. The office manager, Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks), a voluptuously beautiful and capable woman, proves more intimidating than helpful as she gives advice on how to be appealing to the men of the office and how that will lead to both success in the office and a good marriage. Peggy is dismayed to find a secretary in the bathroom crying. A junior account executive named Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) makes boorish comments about Peggy's appearance and clothing, causing Don to rebuke him. On her break, Peggy goes to the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> doctor recommended by the all-knowing Joan, where she gets a prescription for the recently introduced birth control pill, which at the time was not supposed to be prescribed to unmarried women or married women without their husband's consent. Later in the day, Peggy makes a subtle, sexually inviting gesture to Don, but he definitively rejects her advances.|$|E
5|$|Nani is a {{young man}} who specialises in {{preparing}} fireworks. He is in love with his neighbour Bindu, a micro artist who runs Project 511, a non-governmental organisation (NGO). Bindu also develops feelings for Nani though she does not express them. Seeking to raise money for her NGO, Bindu visits the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rich, powerful industrialist named Sudeep, who also finds her attractive. He befriends her, donates 1.5 million (US$ thousand), and gains her trust. Sudeep sees Nani as a rival and plans to kill him. One night, Nani helps Bindu to finish a piece of micro art—a locket made from a pencil. While returning home, he is kidnapped by Sudeep, who kills him, making his death look like an accident. Unaware of the incident, Bindu proposes to the dying Nani by telephone; it is the last thing Nani hears before he is reincarnated as a housefly that cannot remember its previous life.|$|E

5|$|The post {{was created}} by the Treaty of Lisbon and was subject to a debate over its exact role. Prior to Lisbon, the Presidency rotated in {{accordance}} with the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The role of that President-in-Office was in no sense (other than protocol) equivalent to an <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> head of state, merely a primus inter pares (first among equals) role among other European heads of government. The President-in-Office was primarily responsible for preparing and chairing the Council meetings, and had no executive powers other than the task of representing the Union externally.
