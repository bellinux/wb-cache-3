5|$|In the A-not-B task, {{children}} are shown an <b>object</b> hidden at Location A within their reach, and are then prompted {{to search for}} the <b>object</b> at Location A, where they find it. This activity is repeated several times, with the hidden <b>object</b> at Location A. Then, in the critical trial, the <b>object</b> is hidden in Location B, a second location within easy reach of child. Typically, children younger than one year old search for the <b>object</b> under Location A, where the <b>object</b> was previously hidden. However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate the <b>object</b> in Location B, demonstrating flexibility. Researchers have agreed that the A-not-B task is a simple task that effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy.|$|E
5|$|Other, {{more recent}} {{studies suggest that}} the idea of <b>object</b> {{permanence}} may not be an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop <b>object</b> permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is <b>object</b> permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of <b>object</b> permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an <b>object</b> and their perception of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the <b>object.</b> Rather, the <b>object</b> is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the <b>object</b> from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an <b>object</b> may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E
5|$|Real-time {{holography}} is {{a second}} method of creating holographic interferograms. A holograph of the unstressed <b>object</b> is created. This holograph is illuminated with a reference beam to generate a hologram image of the <b>object</b> directly superimposed over the original <b>object</b> itself while the <b>object</b> is being subjected to some stress. The <b>object</b> waves from this hologram image will interfere with new waves coming from the <b>object.</b> This technique allows real time monitoring of shape changes.|$|E

5|$|These {{ideas can}} be {{illustrated}} by drawing objects in pairs. It {{is difficult to}} depict zero groups of two, or to emphasize the nonexistence of a leftover <b>object,</b> so it helps to draw other groupings and to compare them with zero. For example, {{in the group of}} five objects, there are two pairs. More importantly, there is a leftover <b>object,</b> so 5 is odd. In the group of four objects, there is no leftover <b>object,</b> so 4 is even. In the group of just one <b>object,</b> there are no pairs, and there is a leftover <b>object,</b> so 1 is odd. In the group of zero objects, there is no leftover <b>object,</b> so 0 is even.|$|E
5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} {{is that it}} is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium.

Up to a certain mass, an <b>object</b> can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the <b>object,</b> gravity begins to pull an <b>object</b> towards its own centre of mass until the <b>object</b> collapses into a sphere.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} amount of new star formation and star destruction data {{is expected to be}} recorded from continued observation of Sakurai's <b>Object,</b> as well as be used as reference data in the future research of similar stars. The reason that stars such as Sakurai's <b>Object</b> and V605 Aquilae exist, as well as experience a shorter lifespan compared to most stars, is largely unknown. Sakurai's <b>Object</b> and V605 Aquilae have been observed experiencing born-again behavior for only 10 years, while FG Sagittae has undergone such behavior for 120 years. It is hypothesized that this is due to Sakurai's <b>Object</b> and V605 Aquilae evolving to the asymptotic giant branch of stars for the first time, while FG Sagittae is undergoing the process a second time.|$|E
5|$|Although Sedna {{is officially}} {{considered}} a scattered-disc <b>object</b> by the MPC, its discoverer Michael E.

Moreover, the number of false and unwanted <b>objects</b> increases as the demand for seeing small <b>objects</b> makes the radar more sensitive. Generally, the false <b>objects</b> can be avoided by using a reliable tracker. However, the tracker does not exclude unwanted <b>objects.</b> The difference between false and unwanted <b>objects</b> is that false <b>objects</b> do not originate from true <b>objects</b> but are mainly noise <b>objects,</b> whereas the unwanted <b>objects</b> originate from true <b>objects</b> but are unwanted in the surveillance image.

5|$|In {{more recent}} years, the {{original}} Piagetian <b>object</b> permanence account {{has been challenged}} {{by a series of}} infant studies suggesting that much younger infants do have a clear sense that objects exist even when out of sight.
