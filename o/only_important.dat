5|$|Nitrogen is {{the most}} common pure element in the earth, making up 78.1% of the entire volume of the atmosphere. Despite this, it is not very {{abundant}} in Earth's crust, making up only 19parts per million of this, on par with niobium, gallium, and lithium. The <b>only</b> <b>important</b> nitrogen minerals are nitre (potassium nitrate, saltpetre) and sodanitre (sodium nitrate, Chilean saltpetre). However, these have not been an important source of nitrates since the 1920s, when the industrial synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became common.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} games, the visuals of End of Ages were widely praised. The switch to real-time rendering was generally {{seen as a}} positive step. The game's music was lauded; GameSpot's review noted the use of music in End of Ages was sparse, but the little audio present set the proper tone for different Ages. A few reviewers, such as Charles Herold of the New York Times, felt that the graphics fell short of what was possible, especially compared to the prerendered visuals of Myst IV: Revelation. While Greg Kasavin of GameSpot felt that though the visuals were on par {{with previous}} games, End of Ages was missing several elements which made Myst IV more immersive; <b>only</b> <b>important,</b> story-driving items could be interacted with, for example, and the player makes no sounds or footsteps in the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, he {{was picked}} by New York Governor Mario Cuomo to chair a {{scientific}} fact-finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, a job that required him {{to find common ground}} between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant, a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the <b>only</b> <b>important</b> section of the report.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln {{adhered to}} the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary {{responsibility}} for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by Congress; the <b>only</b> <b>important</b> one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction. He signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making {{millions of acres of}} government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|The {{north coast}} is gently {{shelving}} with low cliffs and {{long stretches of}} sandy beach, some sections of which, especially in the northwest, are muddy. The principal coastal feature is Bridgwater Bay, and the <b>only</b> <b>important</b> harbour is at the mouths of the Parrett. The main rivers in Somerset rise in the hills and flow northwards and westwards into the Bristol Channel; these are the Axe, Brue, Parrett and its tributaries, and Exe. The source of the River Axe is at Wookey Hole Caves in the Mendip Hills. It flows through a ravine and then west through the village of Wookey. It splits into two parts which subsequently recombine, and flows across the moors, through Lower Weare and {{to the south of}} Loxton. It passes between Uphill Cliff and Brean Down and reaches the sea at Weston Bay; it forms the northern boundary of the county.|$|E

25|$|To {{find the}} magnetization, fix the scaling of H so that λ is one. Now the field H has {{dimension}} −d/4, so that H4ddx is dimensionless, and Z has dimension 2nbsp&−nbsp&d/2.

25|$|Governor Seay {{would be}} in office only sixteen months. Under his administration, nothing of {{enduring}} importance occurred. The <b>only</b> <b>important</b> event was the opening with a land run of the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reserve on April 19, 1892. This served to widen both the Oklahoma Territory’s and Governor Seay’s domains. Seay governorship {{came to an abrupt}} end when President Grover Cleveland appointed William Cary Renfrow governor on May 7, 1893.|$|E
25|$|Sex steroids {{are not the}} <b>only</b> <b>important</b> {{influences}} upon hypothalamic development; in particular, pre-pubertal {{stress in}} early life (of rats) determines {{the capacity of the}} adult hypothalamus to respond to an acute stressor. Unlike gonadal steroid receptors, glucocorticoid receptors are very widespread throughout the brain; in the paraventricular nucleus, they mediate negative feedback control of CRF synthesis and secretion, but elsewhere their role is not well understood.|$|E
25|$|During the Roman era, the <b>only</b> <b>important</b> {{settlement}} {{within the}} historic area of Surrey was the London suburb of Southwark (now part of Greater London), {{but there were}} small towns at Staines, Ewell, Dorking, Croydon and Kingston upon Thames. Remains of Roman rural temples have been excavated on Farley Heath and near Wanborough and Titsey, and possible temple sites at Chiddingfold, Betchworth and Godstone. The area was traversed by Stane Street and other Roman roads.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Marie de Médicis was exiled to Compiègne. Both Marie and the duc d'Orléans {{continued}} to conspire against Richelieu, but their schemes came to nothing. The nobility also remained powerless. The <b>only</b> <b>important</b> rising {{was that of}} Henri, duc de Montmorency in 1632; Richelieu, ruthless in suppressing opposition, ordered the duke's execution. Richelieu's harsh measures were designed to intimidate his enemies. He also ensured his political security by establishing a large network of spies in France {{as well as in}} other European countries.|$|E
25|$|For {{the symbols}} {{in which the}} bulk, or body, {{terminal}} is shown, it is here shown internally connected to the source (i.e., the black triangles in the diagrams in columns 2 and 5). This is a typical configuration, {{but by no means}} the <b>only</b> <b>important</b> configuration. In general, the MOSFET is a four-terminal device, and in integrated circuits many of the MOSFETs share a body connection, not necessarily connected to the source terminals of all the transistors.|$|E
25|$|About {{the same}} time, Hertford, no longer opposed by Stamford, brought over the South Wales Royalists to Oxford.

Gloucester and Bristol were now the <b>only</b> <b>important</b> garrisons of the Roundheads in the west. In the Midlands, {{in spite of a}} Parliamentary victory won by Sir William Brereton at the Battle of Nantwich on 28 January, the Royalists of Shropshire, Staffordshire, and Leicestershire soon extended their influence through Ashby-de-la-Zouch into Nottinghamshire and joined hands with their friends at Newark.|$|E
