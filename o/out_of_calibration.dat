40|$|A {{significant}} improvement {{to the classical}} least squares (CLS) multivariate analysis method has been developed. The new method, called prediction-augmented classical least squares (PACLS), removes the restriction for CLS that all interfering spectral species must be known and their concentrations included during the calibration. The authors demonstrate that PACLS can correct inadequate CLS models if spectral components left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>calibration</b> can be identified and if their spectral shapes can be derived and added during a PACLS prediction step. The new PACLS method is demonstrated for a system of dilute aqueous solutions containing urea, creatinine, and NaCl analytes with and without temperature variations. The authors demonstrate that if CLS calibrations are performed using only a single analyte's concentration, then there is little, if any, prediction ability. However, if pure-component spectra <b>of</b> analytes left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>calibration</b> are independently obtained and added during PACLS prediction, then the CLS prediction ability is corrected and predictions become comparable to that <b>of</b> a CLS <b>calibration</b> that contains all analyte concentrations. It is also demonstrated that constant-temperature CLS models {{can be used to}} predict variable-temperature data by employing the PACLS method augmented by the spectral shape of a temperature change of the water solvent. In this case, PACLS {{can also be used to}} predict sample temperature with a standard error of prediction of 0. 07 C even though the calibration data did not contain temperature variations. The PACLS method is also shown to be capable of modeling system drift to maintain a calibration in the presence of spectrometer drift...|$|R

To overcome this problem, a statistical quality control technique is warranted that would provide the WIM operator with some guidelines whenever the system tends to go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>calibration.</b> A mixture modeling technique using Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm was implemented to divide the Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) measurements of vehicle class 9 into three components, (unloaded, partially loaded, and fully loaded). Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) statistical process technique was used to identify any abrupt change in mean level of GVW measurements. Special attention was given to the presence of auto-correlation in the data by fitting an auto-regressive time series model and then performing CUSUM analysis on the fitted residuals. A data analysis software tool was developed to perform EM Fitting and CUSUM analyses. The EM analysis takes monthly WIM raw data and estimates the mean and deviations of GVW of class 9 fully loaded trucks. Results of the EM analyses are stored in a file directory for CUSUM analysis. Output from the CUSUM analysis will indicate whether there is any sensor drift during the analysis period. Results from the analysis suggest that the proposed methodology is able to estimate a shift in the WIM sensor accurately and also indicate the time point when the WIM system went out-of-calibration. A data analysis software tool, WIM Data Analyst, was developed using the Microsoft Visual Studio software development package based on the Microsoft Windows. NET framework.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} calibration {{errors of}} Goldmann applanation tonometers in ophthalmic clinics of Brasília, Brazil, and correlate the findings with {{variables related to}} tonometers model and utilization. METHODS: Tonometers from ophthalmic clinics in Brasília, Brazil, were checked for calibration errors. A standard Goldmann applanation tonometer checking tool was used to asses the calibration error. Only one trained individual made all verifications, with a masked reading of the results. Data on the model, age, daily use, frequency of calibration checking {{and the nature of}} the ophthalmic department - private or public - were collected and correlated with the observed errors. RESULTS: One hundred tonometers were checked for calibration. Forty seven percent (47 / 100) were out of 1 mmHg range at least at one point checking. Tonometers mounted to slit lamp, with less than 5 years, used in less than 20 patients daily, that had a calibration check on a yearly basis, and those from private office exhibit a lower rate of inaccuracy, but only the first variable was statistically significant. Sixty one percent of tonometers on public hospitals were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>calibration.</b> CONCLUSION: Calibration of tonometers in the capital of Brazil is poor; those from general hospitals are worst, and this fact can lead to inaccurate detection and assessment of glaucoma patients, overall in the population under government assistance...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Goldmann {{applanation}} tonometer (GAT) is {{the current}} Gold standard tonometer. However, its calibration error is common and can go unnoticed in clinics. Its company repair has limitations. The purpose of this report is to describe a self-taught technique of rectifying calibration error of GAT. Materials and Methods: Twenty-nine slit-lamp-mounted Haag-Streit Goldmann tonometers (Model AT 900 C/M; Haag-Streit, Switzerland) were included in this cross-sectional interventional pilot study. The technique of rectification of calibration error of the tonometer involved cleaning and lubrication of the instrument followed by alignment of weights when lubrication alone didn′t suffice. We followed the South East Asia Glaucoma Interest Group′s definition of calibration error tolerance (acceptable GAT calibration error within ± 2, ± 3 and ± 4 mm Hg at the 0, 20 and 60 -mm Hg testing levels, respectively). Results: Twelve out of 29 (41. 3 %) GATs were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>calibration.</b> The range {{of positive and negative}} calibration error at the clinically most important 20 -mm Hg testing level was 0. 5 to 20 mm Hg and - 0. 5 to - 18 mm Hg, respectively. Cleaning and lubrication alone sufficed to rectify calibration error of 11 (91. 6 %) faulty instruments. Only one (8. 3 %) faulty GAT required alignment of the counter-weight. Conclusions: Rectification of calibration error of GAT is possible in-house. Cleaning and lubrication of GAT can be carried out even by eye care professionals and may suffice to rectify calibration error in the majority of faulty instruments. Such an exercise may drastically reduce the downtime of the Gold standard tonometer...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, current {{profiles}} for plasma discharges on the Mega-Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) {{are directly}} calculated from pickup coil, flux loop and Motional-Stark Effect (MSE) observations via methods {{based in the}} statistical theory of Bayesian analysis. By representing toroidal plasma current {{as a series of}} axisymmetric current beams with rectangular cross-section and inferring the current for each one of these beams, flux-surface geometry and q-profiles are subsequently calculated by elementary application of Biot-Savart's law. The use of this plasma model in the context of Bayesian analysis was pioneered by Svensson and Werner on the Joint-European Tokamak (JET) [J. Svensson and A. Werner. Current tomography for axisymmetric plasmas. Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion, 50 (8) : 085002, 2008]. In this framework, linear forward models are used to generate diagnostic predictions, and the probability distribution for the currents in the collection of plasma beams was subsequently calculated directly via application of Bayes' formula. In this work, we introduce a new diagnostic technique to identify and remove outlier observations associated with diagnostics falling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>calibration</b> or suffering from an unidentified malfunction. These modifications enable good agreement between Bayesian inference of the last closed flux-surface (LCFS) with other corroborating data, such as such as that from force balance considerations using EFIT++ [L.

40|$|Sonic anemometers {{simultaneously}} {{measure the}} turbulent fluctuations of vertical wind (w') and sonic temperature (Ts'), and {{are commonly used}} to measure sensible heat flux (H). Our study examines 30 -min heat fluxes measured with a Campbell Scientific CSAT 3 sonic anemometer above a subalpine forest. We compared H calculated with Ts to H calculated with a co-located thermocouple and found that, for horizontal wind speed (U) less than 8 m s− 1 , the agreement was around ± 30 W m− 2 . However, for U &asymp; 8 m s− 1 , the CSAT H had a generally positive deviation from H calculated with the thermocouple, reaching a maximum difference of ≈ 250 W m− 2 at U ≈ 18 m s− 1 . With version 4 of the CSAT firmware, we found significant underestimation {{of the speed of}} sound and thus Ts in high winds (due to a delayed detection of the sonic pulse), which resulted in the large CSAT heat flux errors. Although this Ts error is qualitatively similar to the well-known fundamental correction for the crosswind component, it is quantitatively different and directly related to the firmware estimation of the pulse arrival time. For a CSAT running version 3 of the firmware, there {{does not appear to be}} a significant underestimation of Ts; however, a Ts error similar to that of version 4 may occur if the CSAT is sufficiently <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>calibration.</b> An empirical correction to the CSAT heat flux that is consistent with our conceptual understanding of the Ts error is presented. Within a broader context, the surface energy balance is used to evaluate the heat flux measurements, and the usefulness of side-by-side instrument comparisons is discussed...|$|E

For instance, Medicare's Hospital Compare webpage provides information to patients about specific hospital mortality rates for {{a heart attack or}} Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI).

By checking the <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sample <b>calibration</b> <b>of</b> their individualized predictions against general empirical advice, we are led to substantial revisions of the Hospital Compare model for AMI mortality. As opposed to Hospital Compare, our revised models incorporate information about hospital volume, nursing staff, medical residents, and the hospital's ability to perform cardiovascular procedures, information that is clearly needed if a model is to make appropriately calibrated predictions. Additionally, we contrast several methods for summarizing a model's predictions for use by the public. We find that indirect standardization, as currently used by Hospital Compare, fails to adequately control for differences in patient risk factors, whereas direct standardization provides good control and is easy to interpret.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{modelling}} expert knowledge about numerical parameters {{in the field}} of reliability is reconsidered in the framework of possibility theory. Usually expert opinions about quantities such as failure rates are modelled, assessed and pooled in the setting of probability theory. This approach does not seem to always be natural since probabilistic information looks too rich to be currently supplied by individuals. Indeed, information supplied by individuals is often incomplete, imprecise rather than tainted with randomness. Moreover the probabilistic framework looks somewhat restrictive to express the variety of possible pooling modes.
