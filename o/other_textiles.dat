5|$|Lurgan has {{historically}} been an industrial town in which the linen industry predominated {{as a source of}} employment during the Industrial Revolution, and is said to have employed as many as 18,000 handloom weavers {{at the end of the}} 19th century, a figure significantly higher than the town's resident population at the time. That particular branch of the textile industry declined as consumer tastes changed, but <b>other</b> <b>textiles</b> continued to be produced in the town providing a major source of employment until the 1990s and 2000s when the textile industry across the UK suffered a major decline as a result of outsourcing to low wage countries.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, {{textiles}} and related trades {{were the main}} source of employment in the town. Bleaching was a widely distributed finishing trade in Salford, carried over from the earlier woollen industry. In the 18th century, before the introduction of chemical bleaching, bleaching fields were commonplace, some very close to the town. In 1773 there were 25bleachers around Salford, most {{to the west of the}} township. Printing was another source of trade; the earliest recorded in the region was a calique printer in the Manchester Parish Register of 1763. These industries became more important as Salford faced increasing competition from the nearby towns of Bolton and Oldham. As its cotton spinning industries faltered its economy turned increasingly to <b>other</b> <b>textiles</b> and to the finishing trades, including rexine and silk dyeing, and fulling and bleaching, at a string of works in Salford.|$|E
5|$|Oswald {{returned}} to England in 958 {{at the behest}} of his uncle, but Oda died before Oswald returned. Lacking a patron, Oswald turned to Oskytel, recently named Archbishop of York. It is possible that Oswald along with Oskytel travelled to Rome for Oskytel's pallium, but this story is only contained in a 12th-century Ramsey Abbey chronicle, so it may not be authentic. Even if he did not travel to Rome, Oswald was active in ecclesiastical affairs at York until Dunstan obtained Oswald's appointment to the see, or bishopric, of Worcester. He was consecrated as Bishop of Worcester in 961. Soon after his consecration, he persuaded Germanus to come back to England and made him head of a small religious community near Westbury-on-Trym. After the establishment of this group about 962, Oswald grew worried that because the monastery was located on lands owned by the see of Worcester, his successors in the see might disrupt the community. He was offered the site of Ramsey Abbey in Huntingdonshire by Æthelwine, son of Æthelstan Half-King, and Oswald established a monastery there about 971 that attracted most {{of the members of the}} community at Westbury. This foundation at Ramsey went on to become Ramsey Abbey. Ramsey was Oswald's most famous foundation, with its church dedicated in 974. Later, Oswald invited Abbo of Fleury to come and teach at Ramsey. Oswald directed the affairs of Ramsey Abbey until his death, when the dean Eadnoth became the first abbot. He gave a magnificent Bible to Ramsey, which was important enough to merit a mention in Oswald's Life. Alongside the gift of the book, Oswald also contributed wall hangings and <b>other</b> <b>textiles</b> to the abbey.|$|E

25|$|Textile {{production}} in Michoacan includes embroidery, back strap and foot-pedal loom weaving, and crochet. Weaving {{dates back to}} the pre Hispanic period, when cotton, ixtle and even feathers and rabbit were used to create cloth and <b>other</b> <b>textiles.</b> All weaving was done on back strap looms, and the relatively narrow cloth stitched together when wider pieces were need to items such as huipils and blankets. The Spanish brought sheep and wool was added alongside the native fibers. They also introduced the framed pedal loom, which allows the creation of wider, thicker and longer pieces. The arrival of the Spanish also introduced new designs, such as horses appearing in weavings. Textile work is still passed on from generation to generation in indigenous communities in the state and is an important source of income for these families.|$|E

2500|$|In 1775 the {{shipowner}} Jacques-Alexandre Laffon de Ladebat (1719-97) {{decided to}} finance {{an expedition to}} the East Indies {{in order to take}} advantage of the opportunity presented by a relaxation of the monopoly on the trade hitherto awarded to the French East India Company at Lorient. He commissioned the construction of a vessel in 1775, the Sartine which left France on 19 September 1776 with instructions to sell her cargo on the Malabar coast, pick up a cargo for China, there pick up a cargo of silks and <b>other</b> <b>textiles</b> for France, and return in 1778. Sartine reached Colombo on 2 February 1777. From there she sailed to Cochin, Mahé, Mangalore, Goa, Surat and Chaoul, then an important trading port about 30 kilometers south of Bombay. [...] On 24 August she sailed for China via Ceylon and the Strait of Malacca. Hurricane damage in October forced Sartine to abandon the voyage to China and instead to return to Malacca for repairs. By 14 January 1778 Sartine was at Pondicherry. From there she made a trading voyage to Karaikal, like Mahé and Pondichéry a French colony. After her return to Pondichéry, the French government requisitioned Sartine and armed her for the defense of the colony against the British.|$|E
2500|$|In the José Azueta (Zihuatanejo) municipality, {{the best}} known beaches are {{associated}} with the large town/small city of Zihuatanejo and the resort of Ixtapa. Zihuatanejo’s beaches line the port’s bay, which mostly shelter them from open ocean. The three largest are the Playa Principal or Playa Municipal, next to the port’s docks, Playa Madera and Playa La Ropa. Playa La Ropa (literally Clothes Beach) gets its name from a cargo of silks and <b>other</b> <b>textiles</b> which washed up onto it when a ship wrecked outside the bay. At the far southeast end is Playa Las Gatas, which can only be reached by boat or by foot from Playa La Ropa, along a narrow rocky path {{on the edge of the}} bay. It has an artificial stone reef which was supposedly built by a Purépecha chief, who favored this beach as a recreational area. Ixtapa was created by FONATUR as a planned resort development between 1968 and 1971 on [...] of beaches and with a marina that mostly serves yachts. Beaches include Playa Linda, Playa de Palmar on the mainland with Playa Quieta, Playa Varadera en la Isla and Playa Coral en la Isla, which are on Isla Ixtapa. There are two golf courses and a long line of luxury mega-hotels lining the beaches, with the exception of those on Isla Ixtapa.|$|E
