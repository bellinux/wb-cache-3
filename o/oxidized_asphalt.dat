40|$|Oxidative {{aging is}} {{a major issue in}} asphalt {{pavements}} that leads to hardening of the asphalt, which further contributes significantly to asphalt pavement embrittlement and eventually results in excessive pavement cracking. In addition, the performance of asphalt binder is also highly related to its service conditions which involve climatic conditions and traffic conditions, such as temperature, moisture and traffic loads. Generally, the mechanical properties of asphalt before and after oxidative aging can be tested in the laboratory; however, the fundamental material science of asphalt before and after oxidative aging is difficult to be investigated in the laboratory regarding chemical composition and property change due to the difficulties of studying the molecular structures and their dynamic behavior in asphalt. Therefore, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation method is used in this study to understand how the chemical composition and property changes of asphalt after oxidative aging affect the physical, thermodynamic, rheological and mechanical performance of the asphalt, and how the <b>oxidized</b> <b>asphalt</b> acts under different conditions, such as loading, temperature, and moisture, compared to the unoxidized asphalt. MD simulation is a computational method used to simulate the physical movements of atoms and molecules depending on time and force field chosen under different conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and loading. Asphalt models before and after oxidative aging are developed for MD simulations in this study under different temperatures, loading and moisture contents. Simulation results show that the oxidized functional groups in asphalt molecules increase the strength of intermolecular bonds of asphalt, which further contributes to the hardening of the <b>oxidized</b> <b>asphalt.</b> Specifically, the internal energy changes, especially for higher magnitude of intermolecular and lower kinetic energies, are responsible for the hardening of <b>oxidized</b> <b>asphalt,</b> and the higher potential energies and for <b>oxidized</b> <b>asphalt</b> further proves that oxidation increases the polarity of molecules in asphalt and forms strongly interacting components. The internal property change is consistent with the external physical and rheological property change after oxidation, which is revealed by the increase of density, bulk modulus and viscosity. Considering the mechanical property of asphalt using MD simulations, both the unoxidized and oxidized asphalts deform more and fail faster with an increase in both compressive and tensile stress rates, especially under tensile stresses. However, the <b>oxidized</b> <b>asphalt</b> is stiffer than the unoxidized asphalt, which shows slower and less deformation, further validating the hardening of asphalt after oxidation. Asphalt is significantly susceptible to temperature. Simulation results show that density, and zero shear viscosity of asphalt decrease with an increase in temperature. Isothermal compressibility and bulk modulus also change under different temperatures. Moreover, the density, bulk modulus (inverse of isothermal compressibility) and zero shear viscosity of <b>oxidized</b> <b>asphalt</b> is higher than the unoxidized asphalt proving the hardening of asphalt during oxidation. The different change trends of isothermal compressibility and bulk modulus between unoxidized and oxidized asphalts under different temperatures indicate glass transition behavior changed after asphalt oxidation. According to MD simulations, the moisture impacts on asphalt before and after oxidative aging are significant regarding bulk modulus and zero shear viscosity. Both bulk modulus and zero shear viscosity of asphalt decrease with an increase in moisture content in the asphalt. Moreover, moisture adversely impacts more on <b>oxidized</b> <b>asphalt.</b> The moisture impact on the density of asphalt before and after oxidation is not significant. Density of <b>oxidized</b> <b>asphalt</b> is constantly higher than the unoxidized asphalt under different moisture contents and the density fluctuations of <b>oxidized</b> <b>asphalt</b> is larger. This indicates that asphalt is more sensitive to moisture inclusion after oxidative aging. Laboratory tests are used to validate MD simulation results. Pycnometer method, Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) and nanoindentation are used to test density, zero shear viscosity, and nanomechanical properties including modulus, hardness and viscosity of asphalt binders with different degree of oxidative aging, respectively. Laboratory testing results are consistent with MD simulation results. National Science Foundation (NSF) Civil EngineeringDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|Rejuvenation {{of highly}} <b>oxidized</b> <b>asphalt</b> {{pavement}} {{is a good}} choice in reducing the binder viscosity and hardness to reach the desired mixture workability and the necessary performance, especially when using high percentage of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) in the mixture. Rejuvenating agents such as emulsified asphalt cements or emulsified recycling agents are utilized for fully cold recycling operations due to the liquid nature for them at ambient temperatures, also these agents have the ability for being scattered throughout the mixture, and do not consider a reason in main air pollution problems. The purpose of this research is studying the effect of emulsified asphalt type cationic slow setting low viscosity (CSS- 1) as a rejuvenator material for an aged asphalt pavement, design cold recycled mixture (CRM) under Superpave system for binder course layer and evaluating the final mix design for stability and flow, index of retained strength and punching strength in comparison with hot recycled mixture (HRM). The results indicated that CSS- 1 played an important role to help utilizing high RAP percentage in CRM as compared to HRM due to its effectiveness as softening agent to the hardening binder...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} address {{pertinent}} issues {{in relation to the}} use of Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) in pavement construction, it is imperative to understand the effects that such additives have on rheological and failure properties in service. In this study, two commercial WMA additives, a proprietary siloxane-based compound and an oxidized polyethylene wax, were added to a soft Roofing Asphalt Flux (RAF), a soft Recycled Engine Oil Bottom (REOB) tainted binder, and a somewhat harder binder containing 20 % <b>oxidized</b> <b>asphalt</b> derived from Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP). Binders were aged according to standard Rolling Thin Film Oven (RTFO) and Pressure Aging Vessel (PAV) protocols. Selected compositions were subjected to a period of extended PAV aging for 40 h. Standard and advanced rheological and failure tests were used to predict the performance of these binders in service. Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) and Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) tests according to Superpave™ protocols were done to determine performance grades. Extended BBR (EBBR) and Double-Edge-Notched Tension (DENT) tests were done to provide further insights into durability and strain tolerance, properties of utmost importance to assure long term pavement performance. The findings of this study show that the addition of the oxidized polyethylene wax WMA additive to REOB and/or RAP tainted systems can provide binders that are unstable and likely prone to premature and excessive low temperature failure in service. In contrast, the siloxane-based WMA additive appears to be a better choice to avoid premature low temperature and fatigue cracking distress...|$|E
40|$|The authors used 9 <b>asphalts</b> <b>oxidized</b> {{at various}} {{temperatures}} and pressures {{to determine the}} hardening kinetics for the DSR function, an easily measured and meaningful surrogate for 15 C ductility that relates well to age-related binder deterioration. For each asphalt, there is a rapid initial period that slows to a constant rate period. This constant rate period can be represented by carbonyl formation (oxidation) rate times a hardening susceptibility (HS). For the DSR function and viscosity, the HS and initial jump were pressure-but not temperature-dependent. The DSR function initial jump was relatively higher than the viscosity initial jump. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} {{analysis}} of shear stress into foundation structure with applied rheological sliding joint into foundation structures. Rheological sliding joint can create {{an important part}} of the building in case that the foundation structure is placed on undermined territory. Buildings which are situated on the edge of settlement trough are often loaded with horizontal deformation from the subsoil. Horizontal deformations then cause shear stress into foundation bottom and tensile forces into foundation. These foundations have to be reinforced a lot or can be structurally modified and can be built on the concrete base layer with rheological sliding joint from different materials. The sliding joint can be created from some different materials but it is often created from asphalt belts. This method was discovered and researched in the 80 th at first. Not many materials were on market in this time nevertheless calculation method to determination of shear stress was discovered. Sliding joint was also patented in 1985. Today it was constructed new testing equipment for new tests at the Faculty of Civil Engineering on VŠB – Technical University of Ostrava because the asphalt belts can have very different properties. The testing equipment also allows include effect of ambient temperature. Ambient temperature is monitored because of strong effect on asphalt behavior. The shear response is monitored at the laboratory test and analysis is provided based on results from these experiments. The main objective of this research is to determine calculation method to design sliding into real building. Shear stress into foundation bottom is the most important outcome because from it can be calculated tensile forces and bending moments in foundation structure on which foundation will be assessed. If the settlement trough parameters are known it can be calculated the velocity of deformation in the subsoil. From velocity of subsoil's deformation can be calculated shear stress and also tensile forces and bending moment according to old method and according to Czech standard (ČSN 73 0039 - Building on undermined areas). Calculations are limited to type of applied asphalt belt because the equation for friction's calculation is based on old materials (only two types of <b>oxidized</b> <b>asphalt</b> belts which were in this time on our market). New results and comparison are obtained from new test...|$|E
30|$|The {{preservation}} of the wellbore stability has fundamental importance during oil and gas well drilling. About 75  % of the side walls {{of oil and gas}} wellbores consist of shale and mud rocks, which are responsible for 90  % of the wellbore instability problems (Corrêa and Nascimento 2005; Jiang et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2012 a, b; Huang et al. 2007). Several types of shales with a significant amount of clay minerals are very reactive once they come into contact with water, and they can cause serious wellbore instability during drilling, like hole shrinkage and hole sloughing and caving (Hisham 2006; Wang et al. 2012 a, b; Zhang et al. 2013 a, b). Wellbore stability has been studied for a long time using mainly two quite different approaches. Some authors consider the problem exclusively {{from the point of view}} of rock mechanics and others from the point of view of chemical interactions between shales and fluids (Wu et al. 1993; Corrêa and Nascimento 2005). Based on the second approach, a variety of water-based drilling fluids and non-aqueous fluids have been applied; meanwhile, many types of wellbore stabilizers have been developed. These wellbore stabilizers have been classified into several groups, including inorganic salts, formate, polymers with special shale affinity, asphalts, sugars and sugar derivatives, glycerol, polyalcohol, and silicates (Van Oort 2003; Guo et al. 2006; Khodja et al. 2010; Jiang et al. 2011; Zhong et al. 2011). Among of them, asphalts as one type of cheap and effective stabilizer can improve wellbore stabilization mainly through plugging or sealing, and they have been divided into four varieties according to modification methods: natural asphalt (no modification, mined from deposit), <b>oxidized</b> <b>asphalt</b> (oxidation by air blown to heighten softening point), sulfonated bitumen (changed into asphalt sulfonate partly to enhance water solubility), and emulsified asphalt (oil in water emulsion to improve dispersion in the drilling fluid and adsorption on the rock surface) (Sharma and Wunderlich 1987; Wang et al. 2005). All types of emulsified asphalts are mostly produced by shearing and thinning a mixture of asphalt, water, and emulsifier using an emulsion machine or a colloid mill. Ionic surfactants are often used as emulsifier, so the emulsified asphalt droplets are mostly charged and possess an electric double layer structure, according to the Stern model (Xie et al. 2005; Fan et al. 2014). Cationic emulsified asphalts have taken the place of anionic ones in drilling fluids to promote inhibition and adsorption (Shi et al. 2003; Wang and Xia 2006). In this paper, a novel cationic emulsified asphalt was investigated to overcome serious instability problems during drilling hydratable shale formations. It had good colloidal stability, particle size distribution, compatibility, sealing property, and flexible adaptability.|$|E
