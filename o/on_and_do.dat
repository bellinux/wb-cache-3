This crystallised in Goldfinger with the Saint George motif, which is stated explicitly in the book: [...] "Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time it really was St George and the dragon. And St George had better get a move <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> something"; Black notes {{that the image of}} St. George is an English, rather than British personification.|$|E
500|$|As with Ladenson's {{observation}} that Bond was being depicted as [...] "the worthy knight", Raymond Benson also identifies the Saint George theme in Goldfinger, {{which he says}} has run in all the novels, but is finally stated explicitly in the book as part of Bond's thoughts after Goldfinger reveals he will use an atomic device to open the vault: [...] "Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time it really was St George and the dragon. And St. George had better get a move <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> something". Jeremy Black notes {{that the image of}} the [...] "latter-day St. George [...] again an English, rather than British image." ...|$|E

After initially denying having seen Bakshi's film, Jackson admitted to having first encountered The Lord of the Rings via Bakshi's film, stating that the film was a [...] "brave and ambitious attempt." [...] In another interview, Jackson stated that he [...] "enjoyed [...] {{and wanted to know}} more." [...] Bakshi is quoted as saying [...] "Peter Jackson did say that the first film inspired him to go <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> the series, but that happened after I was bitching and moaning to a lot of interviewers that he said at the beginning that he never saw the movie. I thought that was kind of fucked up." [...] On the audio commentary for the DVD release of , Jackson acknowledges one shot, a low angle of a hobbit at Bilbo's birthday party shouting [...] "Proudfeet!", as an intentional homage to Bakshi's film.|$|E

500|$|The {{band had}} {{spent much of}} 2002 {{recording}} new material at Studio 880 in Oakland, California for an album titled Cigarettes and Valentines, creating [...] "polka songs, filthy versions of Christmas tunes, [...] salsa numbers" [...] for the project, hoping to establish something new within their music. After completing twenty songs, the rough demo master tapes were stolen that November. The musicians insisted they had no leads on its whereabouts until 2016, when during an interview with NME Armstrong and Dirnt stated that they eventually recovered the material, and that the band is now using the tapes for ideas. The band consulted longtime producer Rob Cavallo about what to do next. Cavallo told the members to ask themselves if the missing tracks represented the group's best work. Armstrong said that the band members [...] "couldn't honestly look at ourselves and say, 'That was the best thing we've ever done.' So we decided to move <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> something completely new." [...] The band members agreed to spend the next three months writing new material.|$|E
500|$|The band's overall {{low profile}} in 2008 was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} due to them spending time working on their second album. However, in December 2008, Delorentos explained in their MySpace blog that a potential record deal had fallen through due to the prospective label encountering financial problems. Added to this, the collapse of Pinnacle, their distribution company, denied the band a chance to release their album in the United Kingdom. Their blog entry stated that [...] "these are strange times for everyone, and for us in the music industry {{there has been a lot}} of uncertainty. It just happened that our opportunity coincided with this extraordinary time." [...] After performing a number of shows with fellow Dubliners Director, Delorentos announced their break-up on 17 February 2009. The split came about after Yourell decided to leave the band due to his desire to [...] "do other things". A MySpace entry stated: [...] "It's with a very heavy heart that we have to let you know that Ronan has decided to leave the band. He feels its best for him to move <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> other things. The three of us will still be making music and will let you know about what happens next". However, they still planned to record their second album, believed to be titled You Can Make Sound, in March 2009 – it would contain all the songs they had written in the previous year – and play [...] "a gig or two" [...] as part of a farewell tour. The band's farewell tour includes shows in Whelan's in Dublin and Cyprus Avenue in Cork. Reaction to the split was generally one of shock – The Kinetiks were amongst the neighbouring bands they had influenced, Jacqui Carroll attributed her discovery of Irish music to an early Delorentos show, whilst blogger UnaRocks, John Walshe of State, Jonnie Craig and others had recently been championing the band's sound. On 22 April 2009, the band announced they would not split after all, citing a newfound excitement for recording as their reason. Yourell later explained that the band signing away their independent stance only to be let down by their record company had [...] "knocked us out of our stride" [...] and had led to him considering his future.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{satisfied}} with the album's keyboard-dominated production nor the band's commercialized image, John Norum decided to leave Europe in November 1986 to pursue a solo career. [...] "I didn't really like the direction the band was going in," [...] Norum said, [...] "We became this teeny-bopper, bubblegum band and I hated that whole image, the spandex, poodle-rock type of thing. I was more into the heavier, guitar-oriented stuff {{and it seemed like}} the keyboards were taking over more and more, and we were becoming more commercial. So I decided to leave.
