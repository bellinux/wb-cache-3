5|$|Across {{the town}} line, NY11A intersects Otisco Road (CR246) and passes several farms <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hamlet of Cardiff. Here, the route runs past {{a line of}} homes prior to passing under US20 at the {{northern}} edge of the community. Outside of Cardiff, the highway becomes known as Syracuse–Tully Valley Road as it slowly curves to the northwest, matching a similar turn {{in the course of the}} creek and its valley. As the road traverses another stretch of cultivated fields, it meets Field Lane, a short connector providing access between NY11A and US20. Past this point, NY11A serves little more than farms before it enters the Onondaga Reservation. At this point, maintenance of the route shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the Onondaga Nation.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the rock}} {{formations}} exposed in Colton Point State Park and the Pine Creek Gorge {{are at least}} 300million years old, the gorge itself formed about 20,000years ago, in the last ice age. Pine Creek had flowed northeasterly until then, but was dammed by rocks, soil, ice, and other debris deposited by the receding Laurentide Continental Glacier. The dammed creek formed a lake near what would later be the village of Ansonia, and the lake's glacial meltwater overflowed the debris dam, reversing the flow of Pine Creek. The creek flooded {{to the south and}} quickly carved a deep channel <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West Branch Susquehanna River.|$|E

5|$|Around 03:00, Hatanaka was {{informed}} by Lieutenant Colonel Masataka Ida that the Eastern District Army was <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> palace to stop him, {{and that he}} should give up. Finally, seeing his plan collapsing around him, Hatanaka pleaded with Tatsuhiko Takashima, Chief of Staff of the Eastern District Army, to be given at least ten minutes on the air on NHK radio, to explain to the people of Japan {{what he was trying to}} accomplish and why. He was refused. Colonel Haga, commander of the 2ndRegiment of the First Imperial Guards, discovered that the Army did not support this rebellion, and he ordered Hatanaka to leave the palace grounds.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second Boer War in 1899, Guest was below the minimum age of 18 for enlisting. He nevertheless managed to join the First City Volunteers, a Grahamstown regiment in which his father had served. Its task of guarding a bridge over a railway line was unappealing, so he took the opportunity of joining the Eastern Province Light Horse, attached to the Highland Brigade, which was recruiting volunteers who could both ride and shoot. Early in the Brigade's advance into the Orange Free State <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relief of Kimberley, Guest got food poisoning and he returned to Grahamstown.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, the palette had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation. Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects. Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through piñon pitch and ashes.|$|E
5|$|In Kingsbury, US4 and NY149 {{head through}} an open area dotted with farms and ponds. The routes proceed southward to a {{junction}} known as Baldwin Corner, where US4 and NY149 split. While US4 heads to the southeast, NY149 continues due south, paralleling the Champlain Canal to an area known as Smith's Basin. Here, NY149 turns east and crosses both a railroad line and the canal—which NY149 had been following since joining US4 in downtown Fort Ann—to enter the town of Hartford. Here, the route winds its way eastward through a rural, mostly undeveloped area of Washington County as it intersects several county roads <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hamlet of Hartford.|$|E

5|$|In Somerset, NY148 {{remains a}} two-lane roadway, passing through sparsely {{developed}} areas <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village of Barker. In {{the southern part}} of the community, the route meets Coleman and West Somerset roads (CR2 and CR3, respectively). Through Barker, NY148 is a two-lane residential street, passing west of Barker Free Library and east of Barker High School. After Haight Road, NY148 leaves the village, continuing north through a lightly populated area. At Arlington Road, the number of homes along NY148 rises once again as the route enters the hamlet of Somerset, located at the junction of NY148 and NY18 (Lake Road). This junction serves as the northern terminus of NY148, while CR15 continues north through Somerset towards Lake Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{insisted that}} Anvil {{required}} an experienced commander, and with Patton gone, Clark {{was the only}} one in the theater. Then Devers received a cable that IV Corps headquarters was <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theater. It was commanded by Major General Alexander Patch, who had a distinguished combat record leading the soldiers and marines of XIV Corps in the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Pacific. With Marshall's concurrence, Devers appointed Patch to replace Patton as commander of the Seventh Army and Force 163 on 2 March. While Patch and his staff planned the operation, Devers ensured that the supplies accumulated for it were not dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{between the}} village of Ovid and the hamlet of Romulus, the two routes split, {{allowing}} NY414 to continue due north to Seneca Falls. NY96, meanwhile, turns to the northwest, following {{the eastern edge of}} the Seneca Army Depot for most of the distance to Romulus hamlet. Just south of the community's center, NY96 separates from the depot grounds and continues north through the hamlet and into the town of Varick. The route uneventfully crosses the town, passing by open fields on a predominantly northward alignment <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fayette town line and a junction with NY336, an east–west connector between NY96A and NY414. NY96 continues across rural terrain to the outskirts of {{the village of}} Waterloo, where the number of homes rises as the route enters the village on Fayette Street.|$|E

5|$|NY18 {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with NY104 south {{of a complex}} grade-separated interchange that includes NY18F, NY104, and the Niagara Scenic Parkway on {{the eastern edge of}} the village of Lewiston. From NY104 east, a right-turn ramp allows access to Creek Road Extension, the first street that modern-day NY18 occupies. NY104 continues north from the ramp, passing over NY18 westbound (which terminates at the merge ramp with NY104 west) <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village while NY18 proceeds to the northeast on Creek Road Extension, bypassing Lewiston to the southeast. After , the highway curves to the north and meets NY104 at an unconventional grade-separated interchange that has a pair of two-way ramps connecting the two state routes. NY18 continues on, passing under NY104 and paralleling the Robert Moses State Parkway as it proceeds north.|$|E
5|$|NY335 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Feura Bush Road {{southeast of the}} hamlet of Delmar {{in the town of}} Bethlehem. Although Feura Bush Road is now NY910A, an unsigned reference route, it was once part of NY32. From Feura Bush Road, NY335 heads northward as a two-lane street named Elsmere Avenue, passing several housing tracts in an otherwise open area of the town. After a half-mile (0.8km), the route meets the Delmar Bypass, a four-lane divided highway carrying NY32 through Bethlehem. Past the bypass, NY335 traverses dense residential neighborhoods <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hamlet of Elsmere, one of several communities located along NY443.|$|E
5|$|NY424 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY380 {{in the town}} of Stockton. The route headed northeast, passing by forests and homes as it ascended Stockton Hill.

After reaching the top of the hill, NY424 became known as Stockton Hill Road and went through fields <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village of Cassadaga. Once in the village limits, the highway intersected Putnam Road (CR71) in an area of Cassadaga known as Burnhams. NY424 continued on {{into the heart of the}} village, passing by homes and the southern end of Lower Lake before coming to an end at an intersection with NY60.|$|E
