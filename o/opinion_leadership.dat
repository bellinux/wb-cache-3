50|$|<b>Opinion</b> <b>{{leadership}}</b> is {{leadership by}} an active media user who interprets {{the meaning of}} media messages or content for lower-end media users. Typically the opinion leader is held in high esteem by those who accept his or her opinions. <b>Opinion</b> <b>leadership</b> comes from the theory of two-step flow of communication propounded by Paul Lazarsfeld and Elihu Katz. Significant developers of the theory have been Robert K. Merton, C. Wright Mills and Bernard Berelson. This theory {{is one of several}} models that try to explain the diffusion of innovations, ideas, or commercial products.|$|E
5000|$|Merton distinguishes {{two types}} of opinion leadership: {{monomorphic}} and polymorphic. Typically, <b>opinion</b> <b>leadership</b> {{is viewed as a}} monomorphic, domain-specific measure of individual differences, that is, a person that is an opinion leader in one field may be a follower in another field. An example of a monomorphic opinion leader in the field of computer technology, might be a neighborhood computer service technician. The technician has access to far more information on this topic than the average consumer and has the requisite background to understand the information, though the same person might be a follower at another field (for example sports) and ask others for advice. In contrast, polymorphic opinion leaders are able to influence others in a broad range of domains. Variants of polymorphic <b>opinion</b> <b>leadership</b> include market mavenism, personality strength [...] and generalized <b>opinion</b> <b>leadership.</b> So far, there is little consensus as to the degree these concepts operationalize the same or simply related constructs.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the highly}} {{statistical}} nature of presidential polls, University of Alabama political scientist John O'Neal has approached {{the study of}} rally 'round the flag using mathematics. O'Neal has postulated that the <b>Opinion</b> <b>Leadership</b> School is the more accurate of the two using mathematical equations. These equations are based on quantified {{factors such as the}} number of headlines from the New York Times about the crisis, the presence of bipartisan support or hostility, and prior popularity of the president.|$|E

50|$|Another {{theory about}} {{the cause of the}} {{syndrome}} is believed to be embedded in the US Constitution. Unlike in other countries, the constitution makes the President both head of government and head of state. Because of this, the president receives a temporary boost in popularity because his Head of State role gives him symbolic importance to the American people. However, as time goes on his duties as Head of Government require partisan decisions that polarize opposition parties and diminish popularity. This theory falls in line more with the <b>Opinion</b> <b>Leadership</b> School.|$|E
5000|$|Since Mueller's {{original}} theories, {{two schools}} of thought have emerged to explain {{the causes of the}} syndrome. The first, [...] "The Patriotism School of Thought" [...] holds that in times of crisis, the American public sees the President as the embodiment of national unity. The second, [...] "The <b>Opinion</b> <b>Leadership</b> School" [...] believes that the rally emerges from a lack of criticism from members of the opposition party, most often in the United States Congress. If opposition party members appear to support the president, the media has no conflict to report, thus it appears to the public that all is well with the performance of the president. The two theories have both been criticized, but it is generally accepted that the Patriotism School of thought is better to explain causes of rallies, while the <b>Opinion</b> <b>Leadership</b> School of thought is better to explain duration of rallies. It is also believed that the lower the presidential approval rating before the crisis, the larger the increase will be in terms of percentage points because it leaves the president more room for improvement. For example, Franklin Roosevelt only had a 12% increase in approval from 72% to 84% following the Attack on Pearl Harbor, whereas George W. Bush had a 39% increase from 51% to 90% following the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5000|$|From the 1950s, {{marketing}} {{began to}} shift is reliance away from economics and towards other disciplines, notably the behavioural sciences, including sociology, anthropology and clinical psychology. This {{resulted in a}} new emphasis on the customer as a unit of analysis.

Market segmentation, especially demographic segmentation based on socioeconomic status (SES) index and household life-cycle, also became fashionable. With the addition of consumer behaviour, the marketing discipline exhibited increasing scientific sophistication with respect to theory development and testing procedures.|$|E

The organizations work together and among their respective communities to promote the Accord’s mission of a negotiated agreement between Israel and Palestine, and to prepare public <b>opinion</b> and <b>leadership</b> to be accepting of the compromises required to solve the conflict.|$|R
50|$|During the 1940s, mass {{communication}} entrenched {{itself as a}} field in its own right. Lazarsfeld's interest in the persuasive elements of mass media became a topic of great importance during the Second World War and this resulted in increased attention, and funding, for communication research. By the 1950s, there were increased concerns {{about the power of}} the mass media, and with Elihu Katz, Lazarsfeld published Personal Influence, which propounded the theory of a two-step flow of communication, <b>opinion</b> <b>leadership,</b> and of community as filters for the mass media. Along with Robert K. Merton, he popularized the idea of a narcotizing dysfunction of media, along with its functional roles in society.|$|E
5000|$|Lazarsfeld's debunking {{of these}} models of {{communication}} provided the way for new ideas regarding the media's effects on the public. Lazarsfeld introduced {{the idea of the}} two-step flow of communication in 1944. Elihu Katz contributed to the model in 1955 through studies and publications. [...] The model of the two-step flow of communication assumes that ideas flow from the mass media to opinion leaders and then to the greater public. They believed the message of the media to be transferred to the masses via this <b>opinion</b> <b>leadership.</b> Opinion leaders are categorized as individuals with the best understanding of media content and the most accessibility to the media as well. These leaders essentially take in the media's information, and explain and spread the media's messages to others.|$|E

50|$|Research {{was done}} in the early 1950s at the University of Chicago {{attempting}} to assess the cost-effectiveness of broadcast advertising on the diffusion of new products and services. The findings were that <b>opinion</b> <b>leadership</b> tended to be organized into a hierarchy within a society, with each level in the hierarchy having most influence over other members in the same level, and on those in the next level below it. The lowest levels were generally larger in numbers and tended to coincide with various demographic attributes that might be targeted by mass advertising. However, it found that direct word of mouth and example were far more influential than broadcast messages, which were only effective if they reinforced the direct influences. This led to the conclusion that advertising was best targeted, if possible, on those next in line to adopt, and not on those not yet reached by the chain of influence.|$|E

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that consumer choice is sub-optimal: simply we satisfice. Limited data, time and expertise render our rationality ‘bounded’. The opinion leader offers {{a solution to}} this problem: when faced with a complex choice, we often seek the opinion of an expert. The Web has fueled an unprecedented expansion of this strategy by enabling ‘virtual’ opinion leaders (see Web sites such as Epinions. com and Amazon. com). However, despite its rise in popularity, <b>opinion</b> <b>leadership</b> has received limited attention in the advertising literature. It is this hiatus that we address and in doing so seek to make two potentially important contributions to the wider research on <b>opinion</b> <b>leadership.</b> First, we link <b>opinion</b> <b>leadership</b> to social network theory and show that, those at individuals who are central to social networks serve as opinion leaders.
