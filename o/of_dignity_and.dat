Following the eruption, relief workers gathered around the girl, speaking with her and listening to her responses. She attracted the attention of the reporters at the site because of her sense <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> courage, and caused controversy when people wondered why the media workers had not saved her (which was impossible without equipment).|$|E

Emphasizing that female genital mutilation is carried out by brute force, its irreversibility, its non-consensual nature, and its links to customs of male domination, Nussbaum urges feminists to confront female genital mutilation as an issue of injustice.|$|E
25|$|In general, Filipino {{women find}} {{pride in their}} work. They do not find {{themselves}} alienated from their chores because they work with, around, and for their families. This family-oriented mindset gives them a sense <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> responsibility. The family and the children are the primary priority some Filipino women's life. In addition to doing housework, the contemporary role of a Filipino wife today is to provide financial support in the household by seeking employment in higher-earning occupations which then expands the Filipino female work outside the household.|$|E

In fact, in Oregon, in 2013, pain wasn't one of the top five reasons people sought euthanasia. Top reasons were a loss <b>of</b> <b>dignity,</b> <b>and</b> a fear of burdening others.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century {{there was}} a {{conscious}} revival of the style in Renaissance Revival architecture, that paralleled the Gothic Revival. Whereas the Gothic style was perceived by architectural theorists as being the most appropriate style for Church building, the Renaissance palazzo was a good model for urban secular buildings requiring an appearance <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> reliability such as banks, gentlemen's clubs and apartment blocks. Buildings that sought to impress, such as the Paris Opera, were often of a more Mannerist or Baroque style. Architects of factories, office blocks and department stores continued to use the Renaissance palazzo form into the 20th century, in Mediterranean Revival Style architecture with an Italian Renaissance emphasis.|$|E
25|$|The {{presidency}} {{began to}} be transformed in the 1990s. Hillery's conduct regarding the dissolution affair in 1982 came to light in 1990, imbuing the office with a new sense <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> stability. However, it was Hillery's successor, seventh President Mary Robinson, who ultimately revolutionized the presidency. The winner of an upset victory in the highly controversial election of 1990, Robinson was the Labour nominee, the first President to defeat Fianna Fáil in an election and the first female President. Upon election, however, Robinson took steps to de-politicize the office. She also sought to widen {{the scope of the}} presidency, developing new economic, political and cultural links between the state and other countries and cultures, especially those of the Irish diaspora. Robinson used the prestige of the office to activist ends, placing emphasis during her presidency on the needs of developing countries, linking the history of the Great Irish Famine to today's nutrition, poverty and policy issues, attempting to create a bridge of partnership between developed and developing countries.|$|E

40|$|Charles Fu's <b>Dignity</b> <b>of</b> Death <b>and</b> <b>Dignity</b> <b>of</b> Life, {{released}} in 1993, caused a great sensation. Ever since then, universities in Taiwan have rushed to offer life-and-death related courses. Nanhua University, for instance, formed Graduate Institute of Life and Death Studies, publishing journals of Life and Death Studies. Secondary schools also put life education into their curricula. People in Taiwan, inspired by Charles Fu, {{have started to}} look at death issues openly, thus leading to a boom in life and death research. As <b>Dignity</b> <b>of</b> Death <b>and</b> <b>Dignity</b> <b>of</b> Life set the trend, it has been regarded as a milestone in life and death studies in Taiwan and a must-have book {{for those who want}} to study life and death. This paper is divided into the following chapters. Chapter one is the foreword, with the introduction of Charles Fu's life and the chapter outline <b>of</b> <b>Dignity</b> <b>of</b> Death <b>and</b> <b>Dignity</b> <b>of</b> Life. Chapter two presents the origin of Fu's life and death issues and the book's academic framework, with sections of a. the relations between Fu's personal "life history" and "life and death studies" b. the academic origin of Fu's construction of life and death studies. Chapter three looks at the reviews on <b>Dignity</b> <b>of</b> Death <b>and</b> <b>Dignity</b> <b>of</b> Life. Chapter four is the conclusions. 傅偉勳《死亡的尊嚴與生命的尊嚴》一書在 1993 年在臺灣出版後，造成極大的轟動，各大學陸續開授生死學相關課程，南華大學更創立生死學研究所並出版《生死學研究》期刊。各中學也將生命教育納入課程之中。由於他的啟迪，國人開始正視「死亡」課題，並帶動了「生死學」的研究熱潮。本書實開風氣之先，在臺灣生死學研究上，有樹立里程碑之歷史地位，也是研究生死學之學者必備之書。本書殊勝之處：如首創「生死學」一詞、提出「心性體認本位」與「科際整合」的生死學、揭櫫「生命十大層面與價值取向」模型與「宗教構成要素十項」、融合知識性與體驗性的生死智慧、開創「死亡品質」一詞、建構生、愛、死「生死學三部曲」等。而本書較為不足之處有如下幾端：生死學理論陳義過高，恐不容易推行、強調「生死學」雙重關照，然全書卻偏向「死亡學」、對制度化宗教之批評不是很允當、缺乏東方化、本土化、性別化的觀照...|$|R

However, K.U. Menon, director of MICA's National Resilience Division, said: [...] "MICA does not encourage such ads which treat the national flag with disrespect.

500|$|Laurence Le Quesne {{argues that}} one of Jardine's {{greatest}} talents, {{and at the same}} time greatest weaknesses, was his ability to formulate a winning strategy without consideration of wider contexts such as the social aspect of the game. On the Bodyline tour, he ignored the diplomacy required of an M.C.C. delegation. Instead, he embarked, according to Le Quesne, to win the Tests and settle personal scores with the Australians. Jardine was personally incapable of reacting to the crowds or responding to the controversy in a way that would have eased tensions, and so was not a good choice as captain given what the selectors already knew of him. Nevertheless, Le Quesne believed that when trouble arose, Jardine conducted himself with [...] "great moral courage and an impressive degree <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> restraint." ...|$|E

So it was really about that moment of choice and the dignity and acceptance between these two great warriors, rather than the actual detail of his actual death. That was actually a tonal choice as to how we saw that character." ...|$|E

It has been widely praised for its pro-socialist stance among the international left, who have taken an interest in Bolivia under his leadership as a [...] "political laboratory" [...] or [...] "a living workshop" [...] for the development of an alternative to capitalism. Domestically, Morales' support base has been among Bolivia's poor and indigenous communities. For these communities, who have widely felt marginalized in Bolivian politics for decades, Morales [...] "invokes a sense <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> destiny" [...] in a way that no other contemporary politician has done. He has received the support of many democratic socialists and social democrats, as well as sectors of Bolivia's liberal movement, who have been critical of Morales but favoured him over the right-wing opposition.|$|E
500|$|The Strawberry Panic! {{short stories}} were {{initially}} panned by Erica Friedman as being [...] "distinctly derivative of Maria-sama ga Miteru". Friedman {{is the president}} of Yuricon, an anime convention geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri. Friedman described the stories as, [...] "candy apples without the apples - all sugary, and gooey and sweet, with not much of anything else to support it". After initially having this stance for the entire series, including an early opinion on the anime version, Friedman later changed her opinion slightly, writing that [...] " [...] turned out pretty good". She went on to say, [...] "There's no denying that Strawberry Panic! wasn't brilliant, but considering that {{it was meant to be}} trashy, it pulled out a few moments <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> elegance out of the trash heap." [...] Jason Thompson regarded the Strawberry Panic! manga as [...] "a nearly plotless cascade [...] everything seems rushed, and it is difficult to keep track of the characters and plot." ...|$|E

He felt the setting and cinematography was [...] "typical Hollywood overstatement", and that as a whole found that Terhune's [...] "sentimental writing" [...] did not do well in film form, calling the resulting film [...] "cloying" [...] and a [...] "minor, unsung film." [...] However, he noted that fans of the novels seemed to thoroughly enjoy the film, suspecting part of it was the [...] "handsome collie" [...] found to play the titular role, and seeing the names of the beloved collies they knew on the screen. A New York Times reviewer called it a [...] "bucolic drama of no discernible merit". The Monthly Film Bulletin praised the dog actors, but felt the film was [...] "stultifyingly mawkish, with a touch of supposed humor contributed by an allegedly English chauffeur". Bob Ross, of the Tampa Tribune, considered it to be an [...] "earnest, well-acted story". Leonard Maltin felt it was a [...] "genuine if schmaltzy" [...] adaptation of the novel.|$|E

500|$|Historian Jim Handy {{described}} Árbenz's {{economic and}} political ideals as [...] "decidedly pragmatic and capitalist in temper". According to historian Stephen Schlesinger, while Árbenz did have a few communists in lower-level positions in his administration, he [...] "was not a dictator, {{he was not a}} crypto-communist". Schlesinger described him as a democratic socialist. Nevertheless, some of his policies, particularly those involving agrarian reform, would be branded as [...] "communist" [...] by the Guatemalan upper class and the United Fruit Company. Historian Piero Gleijeses has argued that although Árbenz's policies were intentionally capitalist in nature, his personal views gradually shifted towards communism. A goal of Árbenz was to increase Guatemala's {{economic and political}} independence. He believed that to do this Guatemala needed to build a strong domestic economy. He made an effort {{to reach out to the}} indigenous Mayan people, and sent government representatives to confer with them. From this effort he learned that the Maya held strongly to their ideals <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> self-determination; inspired in part by this, he stated in 1951 that [...] "If the independence and prosperity of our people were incompatible, which for certain they are not, I am sure that the great majority of Guatemalans would prefer to be a poor nation, but free, and not a rich colony, but enslaved." ...|$|E

Malick, {{a close friend}} of Affleck's godfather, had first met with the actor in the 1990s to offer advice about the plot of Good Will Hunting. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian enjoyed [...] "a performance <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> sensitivity," [...] while The New Yorker 's Richard Brody described Affleck as [...] "a solid and muscular performer" [...] who [...] "conveys a sense of thoughtful and willful individuality". Affleck's performance as a poker boss was considered a highlight of the poorly-reviewed thriller Runner Runner (2013). Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times remarked that it was [...] "one killer of a character, and Affleck plays him like a Bach concerto—every note perfectly played." [...] Also in 2013, Affleck hosted the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live for the fifth time since 2000, becoming a member of the Five Timers Club. He then pushed back production on his own directorial project to star as a husband accused of murder in David Fincher's psychological thriller Gone Girl (2014). Fincher cast him partly because he understood {{what it felt like to}} be misrepresented by tabloid media: [...] "What many people don’t know is that he's crazy smart, but since he doesn’t want that to get awkward, he downplays it. I think he learned how to skate on charm." [...] David Edelstein of New York Magazine noted that Fincher's controlled style of directing had a [...] "remarkable" [...] effect on Affleck's acting: [...] "I never thought I’d write these words, but he carries the movie. He's terrific." [...] Justin Chang of Variety found Affleck [...] "perfectly cast": [...] "It's a tricky turn, requiring a measure of careful underplaying and emotional aloofness, and he nails it completely." [...] In 2015, Affleck and Damon's Project Greenlight was resurrected by HBO for one season.|$|E

In contrasting the literary standards of chivalry with the actual warfare of the age, the historian finds the imitation of an ideal past illusory; in an aristocratic culture such as Burgundy and France {{at the close of}} the Middle Ages, [...] "to be representative of true culture means to produce by conduct, by customs, by manners, by costume, by deportment, the illusion of a heroic being, full <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> honour, of wisdom, and, at all events, of courtesy. ...The dream of past perfection ennobles life and its forms, fills them with beauty and fashions them anew as forms of art".|$|E
