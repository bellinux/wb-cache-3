2500|$|A {{passenger}} {{traveling to}} the British Virgin Islands on a plane bound for the United States from Manchester in the UK was forced off the plane prior to takeoff. The man, a British-born Muslim residing in the United States, said he was singled out {{because he was a}} Muslim pilot and was left feeling [...] "demoralized and humiliated. I must have met the profile <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>I</b> have an Arabic name, I am a Muslim, I'm from Britain and I know how to fly." ...|$|E
6000|$|He hums and he hankers, he frets and he cankers, [...] I {{never can}} please him do a' that I can; [...] He's peevish an' jealous o' a' the young fellows,-- [...] O, dool <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> met wi' an auld man! [...] He's peevish an' jealous o' a' the young fellows, [...] O, dool <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> met wi' an auld man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Too bad, too bad!" [...] sighed Googly-Goo. [...] "I {{have laid}} aside {{more than a}} bushel of {{precious}} gems--each worth a king's ransom--to present to your Majesty <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> wed Gloria." ...|$|E
5000|$|So Peace is <b>on</b> me <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> was born, <b>the</b> <b>day</b> that <b>I</b> die and <b>the</b> <b>day</b> that <b>I</b> {{shall be}} raised up to life (again).|$|R
60|$|Having {{observed}} the kiss behind <b>the</b> door <b>on</b> <b>the</b> previous <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> could {{not deny the}} truth of this assertion.|$|R
60|$|I {{put my arms}} round {{his neck}} and kissed him just as <b>I</b> had done <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when <b>I</b> brought my answer.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘When {{names are}} so appropriate, {{they should be}} easily guessed,’ said I, bowing. ‘But indeed, there was no magic in the matter. A lady called you by name <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> found your handkerchief, and I was quick to remark and cherish it.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{first time}} I ever saw her, driving her geese {{down the hill}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> came to Four Winds, {{she looked at me}} with the same expression," [...] persisted Anne. [...] "I felt it, {{even in the midst of}} my admiration of her beauty. She looked at me resentfully--she did, indeed, Captain Jim." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you are Mr. Lindsay!" [...] the Resident exclaimed, {{dropping}} his pen and rising to his feet. [...] "I received a despatch, yesterday, {{saying that you}} were coming. Of course, I remember you now, having seen you <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> came up here; but your dress is altogether different, and the expression of your face seems so changed." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when <b>I</b> {{found myself}} with twopence in my pocket, I {{naturally}} {{made up my}} mind to go round the world.|$|R
60|$|Then I went, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third <b>day</b> <b>I</b> came to <b>the</b> {{great city}} of Salamis, {{that is also}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sea. Here I abode in the fishermen's {{quarters}} till a vessel was about to sail for Alexandria, and to the captain of this vessel, a man of Paphos, I hired myself as a sailor. We sailed with a favouring wind, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fifth <b>day</b> <b>I</b> came to Alexandria, that hateful city, and saw <b>the</b> light dancing <b>on</b> its golden domes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{might say}} the same,' he returned; 'but I will not. Grant me one favour. Come and hear my last sermon <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> before <b>I</b> go.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{solely because}} you married him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> {{was free to}} ask you to marry me. My wife died four-and-twenty hours before you went to church with Downe. The fixing of my journey at that {{particular}} moment was because of her funeral; but once away I knew I should have no inducement to come back, and took my steps accordingly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He and {{the prince}} had over five hundred with them, when they rode in, your majesty; and parties were arriving, hourly, to swell his force. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> left {{he was going}} out to attack Niort and, that captured, {{he was going to}} move south. That was the message I was charged to deliver. You will find him either in Cognac, or in front of that town." ...|$|E
60|$|The latter {{portion of}} this {{question}} was almost immediately answered to my satisfaction {{by the appearance of}} Miss Ruth, who came skipping down to me and calling out to me in that free and hearty manner with which a woman addresses a friend or near acquaintance, but never a suspected lover. She betrayed no more notion of the Lecks and Aleshine scheme than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> first met her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hurt my leg and cannot ride," [...] quoth the bishop's champion. [...] "I {{strained}} a sinew <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> that <b>I</b> slew <b>the</b> {{three men}} at Castelnau." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> next <b>day</b> <b>I</b> went to <b>the</b> theater, to {{ascertain}} if the play would be repeated. The box-office was closed. The dramatic company had left Rome.|$|R
6000|$|... "Absolutely determined. I will devote <b>the</b> {{next two}} <b>days</b> to earning {{what we want}} for the week to come, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third <b>day</b> <b>I</b> go to Hampshire." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{as to the}} visit, Lucy {{was more}} cheerful than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> first saw her, and {{certainly}} looked better. She had lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was very sweet to the Professor (as she always is), {{and tried to make}} him feel at ease, though I could see the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I think not; just {{a remote}} {{possibility}} perhaps, but {{not more than}} that. It is so indefinitely small, indeed, that you may--yes, I think you may safely calculate upon my starting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> said, or if I find a ship at Wellington going on a trading excursion among the islands, or up to the Straits, or to Japan, I may likely enough take a passage in her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{begin to}} understand,' {{continued}} I. 'Her Highness the Princess' (I said {{this in a}} sarcastic way) 'will not be very angry, believe me, if you break off your connection with the stupid Countess. I am no more an admirer of that lady than you are; but I want her estate. I played you for that estate, and have won it; and I will give you your bills and five thousand ducats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> am married to it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only this, your worship: that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> before <b>I</b> left Holland, I {{caught sight}} of the two persons who had escaped from the constables. They had just landed." ...|$|R
60|$|That <b>the</b> very <b>day</b> <b>I</b> escaped out of {{the wreck}} of the ship in Yarmouth roads, a year after <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> made my escape from Sallee in my patron' fishing boat.|$|R
60|$|I knocked, and {{the door}} was opened by the same heavy, {{overgrown}} housemaid whose lumpish insensibility had tried my patience so severely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when <b>I</b> found <b>the</b> wounded dog.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{much of your}} mind, mistress," [...] said Tyrrel, with a sigh; [...] "and, indeed, I do in one {{resemble}} the apparitions you talk of; for, like them, and to as little purpose, I stalk about scenes where my happiness departed.--But I speak riddles to you, Mrs. Dods--the plain truth is, that I met with an accident <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> last left your house, the effects of which detained me at some distance from St. Ronan's till this very day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] she said, [...] "I tremble at {{the thought}} of your venturing your life. My life is of no importance, and it belongs to you. What I would propose is this. My father will go to Bithoor, and will obtain an order from one of the Nana's {{officers}} for a lady of the zenana to visit the prisoners. I will go in veiled, as I was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> went there. I will change garments with the lady, and she can come out veiled, and meet you outside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] said she, [...] "the saints in Heaven cannot help me {{now until}} they {{take me to}} my rest. There {{is no place for}} me in the world beyond, and all my friends were slain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> was taken. Leave me, brave men, and let me care for myself. Already it lightens in the east, and black will be your fate if you are taken. Go, and may the blessing of one who was once a holy nun go with you and guard you from danger!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wrote <b>on</b> <b>the</b> very <b>day</b> <b>I</b> crossed <b>the</b> frontier, sir," [...] Jack said. [...] "Besides I wrote twice from Russia, but I don't {{suppose they}} ever got the letters." ...|$|R
60|$|After three <b>days</b> <b>I</b> had {{conclusively}} {{made up my}} {{mind that}} Mr. Farewell kept his valuable papers in the drawer of the bureau in the study. After that I always kept a lump of wax ready for use in my pocket. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> fifth <b>day</b> <b>I</b> was very nearly caught trying to take an impression of the lock of <b>the</b> bureau drawer. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> seventh I succeeded, and took the impression over to a locksmith I knew of, and gave him an order to have a key made to fit it immediately. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> ninth <b>day</b> <b>I</b> had <b>the</b> key.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Surely, {{you would}} not betray me!' I cried. 'I will send you twice twenty pounds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> that <b>I</b> set foot upon France. I swear it upon the honour of a French gentleman.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You don’t {{think that}} I dealt with you {{sentiment}}ally enough perhaps? But the sentiment was there; as clear a flame as ever burned on earth {{from the most}} remote ages before that eternal thing which is in you, which is your heirloom. And is it my fault that what I had to give was real flame, and not a mystic’s incense? It is neither your fault nor mine. And now whatever we {{say to each other}} at night or in daylight, that sentiment must be taken for granted. It will be there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> die—when you won’t be there.” ...|$|E
60|$|To {{enter into}} any {{detail of the}} riots would be superfluous: the House is already aware that every outrage short of actual bloodshed has been perpetrated, and that the proprietors of the frames obnoxious to the rioters, and all persons {{supposed}} to be connected with them, have been liable to insult and violence. During the short time I recently passed in Nottinghamshire, not twelve hours elapsed without some fresh act of violence; and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> left the county I was informed that forty frames had been broken the preceding evening, as usual, without resistance and without detection.|$|E
6000|$|I had {{no little}} difficulty, at first, in {{prevailing}} on my dear parents {{to let me}} go; but when I urged on my father {{that he would never}} have become a great captain had he remained in the coasting trade, he saw the truth of what I said and gave his consent. My dear mother, seeing that my father had made up his mind, no longer offered opposition to my wishes. [...] "But, oh Ralph!" [...] she said <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> bade her adieu, [...] "come back soon to us, my dear boy; for we are getting old now, Ralph, and may not have many years to live." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{registered}} at <b>the</b> hotel, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third <b>day</b> <b>I</b> caught <b>the</b> {{young lady}} {{walking in the}} front yard, {{down next to the}} paling fence. I stopped and raised my hat--there wasn't any other way.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right," [...] Alban gravely agreed, [...] "it is madness. I lost {{whatever}} little reason I once possessed, Miss Emily, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when <b>I</b> first met you out walking {{with the young}} ladies of the school." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>ON</b> <b>the</b> next <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> was {{introduced}} to the Jew's workshop, and to the eminent gentlemen occupying it. My model Rembrandt was put before me; the simple elementary rules were explained; and my materials were all placed under my hands.|$|R
