40|$|Of {{the natural}} {{biological}} fermentations, two {{have received a}} great deal of attention and study-the alcoholic and lactic acid fermentations. Of these two processes, the fermentation by or-ganisms of the Lactobacillus group would seem to be ideal for the study of the mechanism of the breakdown of carbohydrates to lactic acid. The quantity of lactic acid produced is large, while the amounts of <b>other</b> <b>fermentation</b> <b>by-products</b> are small and the process is apparently simple. Much of the work done in the study of other biological processes has revealed striking similarity in the mechanisms involved. The carbohydrates containing hexose units are broken down in nearly every instance by animal and plant tissue such as muscle, yeast, mycelial fungi and bacteria to intermediate products containing three carbon atoms. The work of Neuberg has shown this to be methylglyoxal or some closely related substance. Suffice it to say that most tissues possess the property of converting this substance to lactic acid. Lactic acid bacteria are no exception. In a study of lactic acid fermentation by members of the Lacto-bacillus group, Fred, Peterson and co-workers have made impor-tant contributions to our knowledge of fermentation mechanisms in general, by their painstaking analyses of bacterial cultures, and particularly in their study of the fermentation of carbohydrates by L. pentoaceticus. Many members of the Lactobacillus group resemble one another culturally so closely that it is often difficult to find differential characteristics. However, L. pentoaceticus stands out distinctl...|$|E

40|$|Corn stover is one {{of several}} {{feedstocks}} being considered as a biofuel. Although corn stalks currently are not harvested routinely, the huge amount of biomass produced annually makes corn a potential commercial biofuel. Removal of crop residue from the field needs to balance against preventing soil erosion, maintaining soil organic matter levels, and preserving or enhancing productivity. After corn stover is fermented to produce ethanol, the remaining residue is about 70 % lignin. Lignin decomposes slowly, which can help stabilize soil structure. One use of <b>fermentation</b> <b>by-product</b> would be as a soil amendment, thereby minimizing some of the negative impacts of stover removal on soil structure. Laboratory studies show that <b>by-product</b> of stover <b>fermentation</b> increased microbial biomass and soluble C by 20 % compared to soil without amendment. In the Langhei soil, humic acid concentration (r 2 = 0. 84, p< 0. 0001) and aggregate stability (r 2 = 0. 35, p< 0. 001) increased linearly with increased <b>fermentation</b> <b>by-product</b> concentration. Thus, laboratory results suggest that this <b>fermentation</b> <b>by-product</b> has potential as a soil amendment. Returning by-product to the field may slow the loss of soil organic matter caused by removing corn stover. Careful management of stover removal (avoiding eroded or erosion prone areas) and selective placement of the by-product could contribute to a sustainable use of corn stover for ethanol production.

In particular, perturbations to regulators of cellular systems that impact glycolysis and amino acid production while simultaneously decreasing <b>fermentation</b> <b>by-products</b> such as acetate and CO 2 make ideal targets. Intriguingly, perturbation of the Carbon Storage Regulator (Csr) system has been previously implicated in large changes in central carbon metabolism in E. coli.

Results We engaged the CsrA-CsrB ribonucleoprotein complex of E. coli via overexpression of CsrB. CsrB is a 350 -nucleotide non-coding RNA that antagonizes CsrA, an RNA-binding protein that regulates translation of specific mRNA targets. By using shotgun proteomics and targeted metabolomics we established that elevation of CsrB levels leads to alterations in metabolite and protein levels in glycolysis, the TCA cycle and amino acid levels.

50|$|A {{distilled}} {{drink or}} liquor is an alcoholic drink produced by distilling (i.e., concentrating by distillation) ethanol produced {{by means of}} fermenting grain, fruit, or vegetables. Unsweetened, distilled, alcoholic drinks that have an alcohol content of at least 20% ABV are called spirits. For the most common distilled drinks, such as whiskey and vodka, the alcohol content is around 40%. The term hard liquor is used in North America to distinguish distilled drinks from undistilled ones (implicitly weaker). Vodka, gin, baijiu, tequila, whiskey, brandy, and soju are examples of distilled drinks. Distilling concentrates the alcohol and eliminates some of the congeners. Freeze distillation concentrates ethanol along with methanol and fusel alcohols (<b>fermentation</b> <b>by-products</b> partially removed by distillation) in applejack.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>fermentation</b> <b>by-products</b> on {{the isolation of}} ethanol from water using pervaporation was investigated. Two commercial hydrophobic membranes were subjected to experiments with mixtures containing 5 wt. % ethanol in water, in which each individual by-product was added. It was found that by-products influenced the membrane performance significantly. Most severe effects were encountered for the carboxylic acids, which caused an irreversible increase in water flux and decrease in selectivity factor. This was further investigated by contact angle measurements and adsorption characteristics. The adsorption of acids on the membranes was observed {{to be higher than}} for ethanol, explaining the lower selectivity. The hydrophobicity degree decreased significantly in the presence of acids, and hence increased the water flux.

In this study, influence of <b>fermentation</b> <b>by-products</b> on the purification of ethanol from water during hydrophobic pervaporation was investigated. Sugars and salts were found to increase the membrane performance. Reason for this was a change in vapor/liquid equilibrium. 2, 3 -Butanediol decreased the ethanol flux and selectivity factor, while glycerol exhibited no effect. This was explained by a strong sorption of butanediol into PDMS and no sorption of glycerol. Due to the presence of carboxylic acids, hydrophobicity degree of the Pervap 4060 membrane decreased, which resulted in an irreversible increase in water flux and decrease in separation performance. These observations suggested the presence of silicalite-based fillers in the membrane.

The results showed that succinic acid and glycerol are impermeable components, whereas formic acid, acetic acid, and furfural can permeate through the membrane. Succinic acid have no obvious influence on the membrane performance. Meanwhile, the composite membrane can effectively remove formic acid, acetic acid, and furfural present in lignocellulosic hydrolysates.
