5|$|Kentikian {{retained}} her WIBF and WBA belts with {{a unanimous}} decision win over Elena Reid from the United States on March 20, 2009.

5|$|A {{defining}} and best-known {{feature of the}} Mortal Kombat series is its finishing move system called Fatality.

The only exception from this is Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, which instead features the Kreate-A-Fatality, allowing the players to perform their own Fatalities by conducting a series of violent moves chosen from a pool that is common for all characters.|$|E
