Magician Ricky Jay popularized throwing cards within the sleight of hand industry with the release of his 1977 book entitled Cards as Weapons, which was met with large sales and critical acclaim. Some magic tricks, both close-up and on stage, are heavily connected to throwing cards.|$|E

5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been {{deposited}} on top of a layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account <b>of</b> <b>throwing</b> Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body had been buried.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{there were four}} notable Christian heavy metal groups: Messiah Prophet, Leviticus, Saint, and Stryper. Although it is {{debatable}} as to which band was formed first, the Orange County native glam metal group Stryper {{was the most popular}} one. Stryper was also the first band to identify as Christian metal. Stryper gained attention with their way <b>of</b> <b>throwing</b> Bibles to the audience at their concerts. In the beginning, mostly Christians went to Stryper's concerts but soon they reached non-Christian audience. In the 1980s, Christian metal bands closely followed the trends of mainstream metal bands.|$|E
5|$|On 11 July 1833, {{two teenage}} {{brothers}} named William and James Keates were herding cattle along the Swan River north of Guildford {{when a group}} of Noongar approached while en route to collect flour rations from Henry Bull's house. The Keates brothers suggested Yagan remain with them to avoid arrest. While he was staying with them during the morning, the brothers decided to kill the warrior and claim the reward. When the natives were ready to depart, the Keates took their last opportunity. William Keates shot Yagan, and James shot Heegan, another native, in the act <b>of</b> <b>throwing</b> his spear. The brothers ran away, but other Noongar overtook William and speared him to death. James escaped by swimming the river. Shortly afterward he returned with a party of armed settlers from Bull's estate.|$|E

Of course, I don't know that any of these men will apply for reinstatement, but if they do, the above are at least a few of the rules that will be enforced. Just keep in mind that, regardless {{of the verdict}} of juries, baseball is competent to protect itself against crooks, {{both inside and outside the}} game.|$|E
5|$|The calls <b>of</b> <b>throwing</b> so infuriated Marsh {{that at the}} end of the day's play, he {{announced}} that he would wear splints when he was bowling the next day. Marsh took this action to ensure that his elbow was kept straight and to demonstrate that he could bowl fast without throwing. Marsh had previously performed such an exhibition to ground members and the requisite splints and bandages were acquired from the nearby St. Vincent's Hospital, in order to bind his bowling arm. The hospital provided a medical certificate stating that Marsh could not move his elbow while encased in the splints. Marsh was proactive in attempting to defend the legitimacy of his bowling action. Marsh's intentions were published in the Sydney Morning Herald and Curran was made aware that Marsh would seek to challenge him.|$|E
5|$|After {{kicking off}} {{to start the}} game, Arizona got the ball first in the second half. Their first drive went three-and-out. After a 51-yard punt, Nevada took over at their own 11-yard line. They put {{together}} an 11-play, 89-yard drive that culminated with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Cody Fajardo to Richy Turner. During the course <b>of</b> <b>throwing</b> the touchdown pass, Fajardo hurt his hand and was seen shaking it {{on his way to}} the end zone to celebrate the score. He returned for Nevada's next offensive drive. Arizona's next drive got them into Nevada territory, but an interception thrown by Matt Scott ended any hopes of scoring. Nevada took the field and drove 84 yards down the field on 15 plays. Near the end of the drive once Nevada was inside the 10-yard line, Fajardo ran the ball for a gain of three yards. During the course of the play, he took a hit to the head from an Arizona defender. He exited the game for one play, but subsequently returned on that drive and scored a one-yard rushing touchdown. Arizona was held scoreless in the quarter, and heading into the final quarter of regulation, Nevada possessed a 45-28 lead.|$|E

5|$|At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu {{is selling}} items to {{customers}} at outrageous prices, like normal. Apu scribbles out the 1989 expiration date on {{a package of}} ham and then lowers the price instead <b>of</b> <b>throwing</b> it out. Homer buys the meat, eats it, and contracts food poisoning. After recovering, Homer returns to the Kwik-E-Mart to complain, and Apu gives him two five-pound buckets of expired shrimp to placate him. Homer eats the shrimp and becomes ill again. Whilst recovering at home, Homer sees the Channel 6 investigative news program Bite Back with Kent Brockman. Lisa gives him the idea to get the show to investigate the Kwik-E-Mart. Kent gives Homer a giant novelty hat containing a spy camera to expose Apu for selling expired food. Though Homer almost immediately abandons the hat after mistaking the buzzing of the machinery as a bee, the camera catches Apu placing a hot dog that he had dropped on the ground back into the hot dog cooker. Apu is immediately fired by his company (even though he was actually following company policy), and is replaced by actor James Woods, who is doing research for a role in an upcoming film.|$|E
5|$|For Walther, at the bridge, the {{position}} appeared defensible {{for as long}} as it would take to remove Ney's force through Winterthur, yet the shock of the Austrian force, as it hit his defences, was sufficient to break his line after 90 minutes of brisk fighting. But there the Austrian forward momentum stalled. Although Hotze's men forced Walther's from the bridge, they themselves could not cross it. From the ridge, Ney's rear guard maintained a steady stream of cannon fire on any of the Austrians who crossed the bridge and attempted to advance up the hill. Hotze recognised the futility <b>of</b> <b>throwing</b> his men into direct cannon fire and ordered instead a steady musketry barrage. This proved effective, for Ney was again injured, this time in his left hand, and his second horse was killed; he relinquished command to Gazan, who organised the continued withdrawal from {{the position}}.|$|E
5|$|Halcombe {{grew up in}} South Australia, {{and studied}} at St Peter's College, Adelaide in his youth. There he earned the {{attention}} of cricket watchers for his skill and his suspect action. Halcombe was suspected <b>of</b> <b>throwing,</b> meaning an illegal bowling action in which a player straightens his arm {{in the process of}} delivering the ball, thereby throwing it, whereas the laws of cricket required that a bowler did not change the angle of his elbow in delivering the ball. In 1923, while still a schoolboy, he was observed by former England captain Archie MacLaren (who was currently visiting Australia as part of the Marylebone Cricket Club team) and former Australia captain and all rounder George Giffen. To test the legitimacy of Halcombe's action, his wrist, forearm and elbow were encased in splints, so that he could not move his elbow position. He delivered balls at varying speeds, and the experts failed to detect an illegal action.|$|E
50|$|Most throws {{are named}} by {{describing}} the circumvention point <b>of</b> the <b>throw</b> (e.g., hip throw, shoulder throw, wrist throw etc.), or {{the nature of}} effect <b>of</b> the <b>throw</b> on the opponent (e.g., heaven and earth throw, valley drop, body drop) with variations are given descriptive names. The names used here are attributed to Jujutsu throws (and hence judo/aikido throws) are descriptions in Japanese. It is conventional for the Japanese to name their throws in this manner, and many western martial art dojos have given English names to the throws feeling that {{it is easier for}} English speaking students to remember the names <b>of</b> <b>throws</b> if they can associate the throws by the descriptive nature <b>of</b> the <b>throw</b> name.|$|R

5|$|The {{majority}} of the European population before industrialization lived in rural communities or isolated farms and households. The norm was self-sufficiency with {{only a small percentage}} of production being exported or sold in markets. Large towns were exceptions and required their surrounding hinterlands to support them with food and fuel. The dense urban population could support a wide variety of food establishments that catered to various social groups. Many of the poor city dwellers had to live in cramped conditions without access to a kitchen or even a hearth, and many did not own the equipment for basic cooking. Food from vendors was in such cases the only option. Cookshops could either sell ready-made hot food, an early form of fast food, or offer cooking services while the customers supplied some or all of the ingredients. Travellers, such as pilgrims en route to a holy site, made use of professional cooks to avoid having to carry their provisions with them. For the more affluent, there were many types of specialist that could supply various foods and condiments: cheesemongers, pie bakers, saucers, waferers, etc. Well-off citizens who had the means to cook at home could on special occasions hire professionals when their own kitchen or staff could not handle the burden <b>of</b> <b>throwing</b> a major banquet.|$|E
5|$|While at {{high school}} in Fayetteville, Skip played for the school's {{football}} team at the quarterback position, bringing moderate success to the program. As a high school junior, he visited Notre Dame and met with head football coach Gerry Faust and head basketball coach Digger Phelps. In his final year of high school, Skip was denied admission to Notre Dame due to average grades and his failure to learn a foreign language. Coaches Faust and Phelps encouraged Skip to enroll at nearby Holy Cross College, located adjacent to the university in Notre Dame, Indiana. After two years of study at Holy Cross, Skip had improved his grades and transferred to Notre Dame. After his first year, Skip {{decided he wanted to}} speak with Coach Faust about walking on to the football team during his senior year. The discussions were cut short, however, as after the 1985 season, Coach Faust resigned. Replacing Faust was Skip's father, Lou, who eagerly accepted his son as a walk-on. Skip began spring practice before the 1986 season as a quarterback, but quickly changed to flanker due to his lack <b>of</b> <b>throwing</b> ability. As a flanker, he earned 54yards on three receptions at the Blue-Gold intra-squad game in the spring of 1986. During the fall of 1986, Skip played in all 11 games on special teams. He never caught a pass, but rushed once for one yard.|$|E
5|$|Whimpress tabled various {{hypotheses}} for Crockett's actions. At the time, Crockett was 37 {{years old}} {{and was ready to}} emerge from the shadow of Phillips, the eminent Australian umpire of the time. When Crockett called Marsh, it was his 29th match as a first-class umpire and the no-balling was seen in some quarters as a signal that he felt ready to officiate in Test matches. A cynical view of Crockett's calls held that if throwing was to be eradicated then the umpire was going to choose a soft target. This theory ruled out the calling of a fellow Victorian, his state of origin. The same line of reasoning concluded that a New South Welshman would be called, and likely not a high-profile Test player like Noble or Jack Saunders. Those who adhered to this hypothesis believed that it would be easier for Crockett to target someone who had a previous stigma <b>of</b> <b>throwing</b> and that Marshâ€”an aborigine who led the bowling averages with 21 wickets at 17.38â€”was an ideal target.|$|E

5|$|In aikido, as in {{virtually}} all Japanese martial arts, there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and conditioning, as well as specific techniques. Because {{a substantial portion of}} any aikido curriculum consists <b>of</b> <b>throws,</b> beginners learn how to safely fall or roll. The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist <b>of</b> <b>throws</b> and pins. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.|$|R
