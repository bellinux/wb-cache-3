50|$|In business, <b>overhead</b> or <b>overhead</b> <b>expense</b> {{refers to}} an ongoing expense of {{operating}} a business; it {{is also known as}} an operating <b>expense.</b> <b>Overheads</b> are the expenditure which cannot be conveniently traced to or identified with any particular cost unit. Therefore, overheads cannot be immediately associated with the products or services being offered, thus do not directly generate profits. However, overheads are still vital to business operations as they provide critical support for the business to carry out profit making activities. For example, overhead costs such as the rent for a factory allows workers to manufacture products which can then be sold for a profit. Such expenses are incurred for output generally and not for particular work order; e.g., wages paid to watch and ward staff, heating and lighting expenses of factory, etc. Overheads are also very important cost element along with direct materials and direct labor.|$|R

Since the financial issues Regus experienced in 2003 the company has successfully turned it fortunes around, as the serviced office industry has continued to grow in popularity.|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} a non-cryptology and protocol-independent {{technique}} {{based on information}} hiding, called Data-Oriented Security Model (DOSM). Instead of one layer of protection, the proposed scheme offers two-fold protection against attack. An attacker first explores whether the data in question carries any useful information and then conducts extraction on it. Information is concealed by changing some properties of the data, which does not incur extra overheads to the sensor nodes. With the help of DOSM, each forwarding node can verify the embedded marks using the source node ID in each packet. This mechanism is used to filter data in a distributed manner. It can also avoid fake and tamper attacks by terminating bad packets {{as soon as they}} are detected. The data security is guaranteed by filtering the inconsistent packets between the hidden data and its source ID, which yields low energy consumption and high reliability. The simulation results show that the proposed DOSM protects the security of data communication and achieves data authentication invisibly at small <b>overhead</b> <b>expense...</b>|$|R
