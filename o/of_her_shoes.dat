5|$|Nick Dalton, an {{attorney}} and key-holder for the Playboy Club, introduces himself to newly hired Bunny Maureen and asks her for cigarettes. Maureen notifies to him that she is out of cigarettes, {{and goes to the}} storeroom to resupply. Bruno Bianchi, who previously tried to dance with her, is at the premises and attempts to seduce her. A terrified Maureen begins to resist his attempts; the two later get into a scuffle. Dalton—checking on his order—witnesses the attack and gets into an altercation with Bianchi. Maureen stabs Bruno Bianchi in the neck with the heel <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes,</b> killing him. Nick Dalton later informs her that Bianchi is the head of a local chapter of the Chicago Outfit. They dispose of his body in the Chicago River, and Dalton provides refuge for Maureen at his condominium.|$|E
25|$|Nina Williams has blonde {{ponytail and}} blue eyes, and voluptuous yet {{powerful}} build. Her look contrasts {{that of her}} sister, Anna, who is a brunette. Nina dresses primarily in purple fitted costumes and is commonly seen wearing a military style outfit (to suit her occupation), sometimes also in costumes made of materials resembling spandex, PVC and leather; most <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> also consist of heels. In Tekken 6, one of Nina's extra outfits {{is one of her}} Death by Degrees costumes.|$|E
25|$|Less {{than two}} months after the murder of Dawn Basom, on June 9, three teenage boys {{discovered}} a partially nude body of a young woman in a field close to an abandoned farmhouse on North Territorial Road. The victim had received multiple slash and stab wounds to the body (including two stab wounds which had pierced her heart), and a gunshot wound to the forehead before her neck had been cut through to the spine. The victim's right thumb had also received a gunshot wound, suggesting the woman had instinctively raised her hand to protect herself before her killer had fired the gun at point-blank range. She had also been raped, although the pathologist was unable to determine whether this act had occurred before or after death. Sections of her clothing were scattered around her body, although one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> was missing.|$|E
60|$|Miss Rose drew {{a pattern}} {{on the floor with}} the toe <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe.</b>|$|R

50|$|Ahn-chae {{ran after}} the bus, but broke the right heel <b>of</b> <b>her</b> high-heel <b>shoes.</b> The bus left, and Ahn-chae gave a {{disappointed}} look. Looking at the condition <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe,</b> Ahn-chae {{decided that she}} would buy {{a new pair of}} shoes for herself, a pair of black shoes which appealed to her.|$|R
500|$|He {{described}} in detail his abduction of Georgann Hawkins from the brightly lit UW alley—how he lured her to his car, clubbed and handcuffed her, drove her to Issaquah and strangled her, spent the entire night with her body, and revisited her corpse on three later occasions. [...] He also admitted, for the first time, that {{he returned to the}} UW alley the morning after Hawkins's abduction and murder. There, in the very midst of a major crime scene investigation, he located and gathered Hawkins's earrings and one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes,</b> where he had left them in the adjoining parking lot, and departed, unobserved. [...] "It was a feat so brazen," [...] wrote Keppel, [...] "that it astonishes police even today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Minnie was {{designed}} in the fashion of a [...] "flapper" [...] girl. Her main outfit consisted of a short flapper girl dress that often revealed her distinctive patched knickers. [...] In the 1929 cartoon The Karnival Kid, it was also revealed that she wears black stockings which were also fashionable among flapper girls. Her shoes are probably her most distinctive article of clothing. For comedic effect, she wears oversized high heeled pumps that are too big for her feet. Her heels often slip out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes,</b> and she even loses her shoes completely in The Gallopin' Gaucho. When she walked or danced, the clip clop of her large pumps was usually heard clearly and often went with {{the rhythm of the}} music that was played in the background. Along with Mickey, she was redesigned in 1940. Her hat was replaced with a large bow, and bows were added to her shoes as well. Her eyes were also given more detail. Throughout the forties and fifties, her look and personality became more conservative. [...] Minnie almost always wears red or pink, but in her early appearances, she could be seen wearing a combination of blue, black or green (when not depicted in black and white).|$|E
60|$|Edith sighed. She {{contemplated}} the tips <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> for some moments.|$|E
6000|$|He stopped abruptly. Her {{eyes were}} downcast. [...] "No," [...] she said, tracing a curve {{with the point}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe.</b> [...] "No. I am not going." ...|$|R
6000|$|Olive {{looked for}} a moment at the toe <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe.</b> [...] "I had an idea that you would have married him by this time," [...] she {{presently}} remarked.|$|R
6000|$|She {{took his}} hand and laid her cheek against it; yet, to the music, which had begun again, the tip <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe</b> was already beating time. And he said: ...|$|R
60|$|Hanscom {{then told}} him of the {{comparison}} he had made <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> with the drawings in his note-book, and the coroner listened intently.|$|E
6000|$|Dorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms, {{and having}} said one last good-bye she clapped the heels <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> {{together}} three times, saying: ...|$|E
60|$|The captain's inexorable {{forefinger}} {{pointed to}} {{a corner of the}} room--dropped slowly as his wife retired before it--and suddenly stopped at the region <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s, a {{religious}} fanatic attempted to assassinate Gamar Almaszadeh on <b>her</b> way out <b>of</b> the theatre, but the bullet hit the spike heel <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe</b> leaving Gamar unharmed.|$|R
6000|$|... "She cared no {{more for}} her {{daughter}} than for the sole <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe!</b> But Noemie has no need of influence. She is sufficient to herself. She is stronger than I." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} make it all right about those Hostels. Don't you fear. You and your Hostels! You shan't touch those hostels ever again. Ever. Mrs. Pembrose go! Why! You ain't worthy to touch the heel <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe!</b> Mrs. Pembrose!" ...|$|R
60|$|The crash {{brought the}} farmer's wife rushing into the room. Christine had well-nigh sprung out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes.</b> Mrs. Wake's enquiry what had {{happened}} was answered by the evidence of her own eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, as I {{entered the}} cabin the girl Rita {{was sitting with}} her feet on a stool, and {{the size and shape}} of her shoe soles {{appeared}} to me about {{the size and shape of}} the tracks made in the flour, and I had just started to take one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> in order to compare it with the drawings I carried in my pocket-book when Busby jumped me. I had to wear him out before I could go on; but finally I made the comparison and found that the soles <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> fitted the tracks exactly. Then I decided to bring her down, too." ...|$|E
60|$|If you've got the PAUSE right, she'll fetch a dear little yelp {{and spring}} right out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes.</b> But you MUST get the pause right; {{and you will}} find it the most {{troublesome}} and aggravating and uncertain thing you ever undertook.|$|E
2500|$|A {{cocktail}} at the Ritz Hotel in London {{is called}} [...] "The Tallulah", named for when Bankhead visited {{the hotel and}} drank champagne out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe.</b> The first annual Gay Pride Festival in New Orleans, held in 1979, was dedicated to Bankhead.|$|R
6000|$|... "One for you," [...] she said, stooping forward, {{balancing}} the sheeny toe <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe</b> on the brown mould, [...] "and the rest for me. Catch!" [...] She dropped a wasp-bitten, pulpy fruit into my hands. [...] "Now then. It's shadier here. No eavesdroppers. Just {{you and me}} and God. Please sit down?" ...|$|R
60|$|Penelope sighed {{once more}} {{and looked at the}} tips <b>of</b> <b>her</b> patent <b>shoes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Half an {{hour after}} this, Miriam {{came out of her}} bedroom, holding a bit of lighted candle in her hand. She was dressed, with the {{exception}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes.</b> Softly she advanced {{to the foot of the}} stairs which led to the floor above.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pott {{read the}} paragraph, uttered a loud shriek, and threw herself at full length on the hearth-rug, screaming, and tapping {{it with the}} heels <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes,</b> in a manner which could leave no doubt of the propriety of her {{feelings}} on the occasion.|$|E
60|$|Round {{and round}} they whirled, {{and the young}} Witch jumped so high {{that he could see}} the scarlet heels <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes.</b> Then right across the dancers came the sound of the {{galloping}} of a horse, but no horse was to be seen, and he felt afraid.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me see!" [...] Miss Lynde leaned forward, {{with her}} elbow {{on her knee}} and her chin in her hand, and softly kicked the edge <b>of</b> <b>her</b> skirt with the toe <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe,</b> as if in deep thought. Jeff {{waited for her to}} play her comedy through. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I think I did wish to know--at one time." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{smoothed}} her crumpled skirts, and looked steadily {{at the tip}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> brown <b>shoe.</b>|$|R
50|$|His wife, Kathryn (1887-1937), died on October 31, 1937 at Ossining Hospital {{after she}} fell at the Cortlandt, New York {{end of the}} Bear Mountain Bridge. The heel <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe</b> was caught between two boards and it caused her to fall and break her leg. She wasn't found until {{nighttime}} and she died from hypothermia.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother didn't say {{anything}} about our money, and she won't wish us to give up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it," [...] cried Jo, examining the heels <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> in a gentlemanly manner.|$|E
60|$|He saw {{her black}} hair, her correct facial curves and profile, and the {{roundness}} of {{her chin and}} throat. He saw then {{the side of her}} eyelids, eyes, and lashes, and the shape of her ear. Next he noticed her figure, her skirt, and the very soles <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Her {{husband and}} two men tried to release her, {{but they could not}} {{disengage}} her shoes from the deck; so Sammy was obliged to loosen her shoe-strings, and then he and another man lifted her out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> and carried her to the hatchway, whence she very speedily hurried below.|$|E
60|$|It was Rosamund who spoke, restlessly tracing {{circles in}} the grass with the point <b>of</b> <b>her</b> white <b>shoe.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Mr Abel {{being in}} a {{thoughtful}} frame of mind, and having quite enough {{to do to keep}} the pony going, went jogging on without looking round: little dreaming of the strange figure that was close behind him, until the Marchioness, having in some degree recovered her breath, and the loss <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe,</b> and the novelty <b>of</b> <b>her</b> position, uttered close into his ear, the words--'I say, Sir'-- ...|$|R
60|$|He {{sat still}} with his hat between his hands, {{as if he}} could not find a chance of dismissing himself, and she {{remained}} looking down at her skirt where it tented itself over the toe <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoe.</b> The tall clock in the hall ticked second after second. It counted thirty of them at least before he spoke, after a preliminary noise in his throat.|$|R
