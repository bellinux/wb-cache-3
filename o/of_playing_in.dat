5|$|A {{creative}} {{player on}} the ball, with excellent vision, technical skills, and an eye for goal, he is a free kick specialist and is capable <b>of</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> several offensive positions. Due to his short stature, dynamic abilities and pace, Giovinco acquired the nickname formica atomica ("atomic ant", after the eponymous Hanna-Barbera character) in his youth.

5|$|Bieksa {{was known}} as a two-way defenceman with the Canucks, capable <b>of</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> all situations. Throughout his NHL career, he has been placed on {{shutdown}} pairing with such defensive partners as Willie Mitchell and Dan Hamhuis. Offensively, he regularly jumps into the rush and has led the Canucks in defensive scoring in 2006–07 and 2008–09. His play is characterized by aggressive and competitive components. He also earned a reputation as a fighter early in his career in the AHL. However, Bieksa's scoring dropped off in his first season with the Ducks.He has been praised throughout his career for his leadership qualities.|$|E

Although disappointed, Hextall was now playing {{at a higher level}} than at WHL and made his debut in professional hockey. He played 19games for Kalamazoo, recording six wins and a GAA of4.35. During the season, he moved to the Flyers' other farm team; Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League (AHL), where he played 11times, with four wins, and a GAA of3.68.|$|E

It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music.

5|$|McBride and his {{partners}} sold the team {{to a group of}} Cleveland businessmen in 1953 for a then-unheard-of $600,000. Eight years later, the team was sold again, this time to a group led by New York advertising executive Art Modell. Modell fired Brown before the 1963 season, but the team continued to win behind running back Jim Brown. The Browns won the championship in 1964 and reached the title game the following season, losing to the Green Bay Packers. The team subsequently reached the playoffs three times in the late 1980s, but fell short <b>of</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the Super Bowl, the inter-league championship game between the NFL and the rival American Football League (AFL) that started in 1966.|$|E

McNamara was named as a reserve to the Western Conference's All-Star team and played in the Gillette D-League All-Star Game on February 17, 2007, in Las Vegas.

5|$|Swift {{broke into}} the Manchester City first team in 1933, {{taking part in the}} club's run to the 1934 FA Cup Final, where the club triumphed 2–1 against Portsmouth.

War denied Swift several years <b>of</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> his prime, though during wartime he was chosen to {{represent}} his country in international matches.

This ended 33 consecutive years <b>of</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the highest league that the German Football Association permits the second team of a professional football team to play.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the southern hemisphere, Macartney headed to New Zealand for a stint with Otago instead <b>of</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> Australia in 1909–10, due to attractiveness of the foreign outfit's remuneration. The period was unsuccessful for Otago—all three matches were lost—but Macartney was prolific as an individual. He took match figures of 7/68 against Canterbury and 7/81 in the first innings of a game against Australia, removing Test teammates Warwick Armstrong and Warren Bardsley. He ended with 17 wickets at 17.53 and scored 132 runs at 22.00.|$|E
5|$|While {{technical}} {{improvements and}} an equal-tempered scale reduced {{the need for}} two clarinets, the technical difficulty <b>of</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> remote keys persisted, and the A has thus remained a standard orchestral instrument. In addition, by the late 19th century, the orchestral clarinet repertoire contained so much music for clarinet in A that the disuse of this instrument was not practical. Attempts were made to standardise to the B instrument between 1930 and 1950 (e.g., tutors recommended learning routine transposition of orchestral A parts on the B clarinet, including solos written for A clarinet, and some manufacturers provided a low E on the B to match {{the range of the}} A), but this failed in the orchestral sphere.|$|E

5|$|Giovinco is a small, quick, {{technically}} gifted, and agile player, with noted dribbling skills, balance, acceleration, {{and excellent}} ball control; these characteristics {{allow him to}} beat opponents, hold up the ball {{with his back to}} goal or in tight spaces, and create space or chances for teammates, despite his lack of strong physical attributes. Although he is capable of scoring goals, he also possesses good link-up play as well as notable playmaking skills, and he is known for his vision, creativity, and his passing and striking ability with both feet, despite being naturally right footed, as well as his accuracy and ball delivery from free kicks. Giovinco is capable <b>of</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> several offensive positions, and he is usually deployed in a free role as a second striker, although he is also capable of playing as a winger, on either flank, or in the centre as a creative attacking midfielder; he has also been used in a more offensive, central role as a main striker.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Dennis Wise, ex-Chelsea and England player, became caretaker, and {{subsequently}} permanent player-manager, of the club. In {{his first season}} in charge Wise led the club to the first FA Cup Final in their history. When Millwall took to the field at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff they were only the second team from outside the top flight {{to play in the}} Cup final since 1982, and were the first team from outside the Premier League to reach the final since the foundation of the top tier in 1992. The club was missing 16 players from their squad due to suspension or injury. They played the Cup final on 22 May 2004, losing 3–0 to Manchester United. As United had already qualified for the UEFA Champions League, Millwall were assured <b>of</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the UEFA Cup. Midfielder Curtis Weston, substituted for Wise with one minute of normal time remaining, became the youngest Cup final player in history at 17 years 119 days, beating the 125-year-old record of James F. M. Prinsep. In the 2004–05 UEFA Cup, Millwall lost 4–2 on aggregate in the first round proper to Hungarian champions Ferencváros, with Wise scoring both Millwall's goals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of 2013, in order to rest his body and improve his chances <b>of</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the 2015 Rugby World Cup McCaw {{enforced}} the sabbatical clause in his NZRFU contract. As a result, he only played the latter rounds of Super Rugby, and missed the 2013 French Test Series. He later returned to captain the All Blacks as they successfully defended the Rugby Championship. During this campaign, McCaw equalled (with Brian O'Driscoll of Ireland and John Smit of South Africa) the record as captaining the most test matches (83). McCaw subsequently overtook this record when playing in Japan on 2 November 2013. Following the All Blacks victory over the Springboks in Ellis Park, McCaw has played and won at every major Rugby Test stadium.|$|E
