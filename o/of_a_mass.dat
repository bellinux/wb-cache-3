5|$|Goebbels' efforts {{had little}} impact {{for the time}} being, as while Hitler was in {{principle}} in favour of total war, he {{was not prepared to}} implement changes over the objections of his ministers. The discovery around this time <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mass</b> grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 Katyn massacre was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other western allies.|$|E
5|$|Igbo Landing (alternatively {{written as}} Ibo Landing, Ebo Landing, or Ebos Landing) is a {{historic}} site at Dunbar Creek on St. Simons Island, Glynn County, Georgia. It was the setting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mass</b> suicide in 1803 by captive Igbo people who had taken control of their slave ship and refused to submit to slavery in the United States. The event's moral value as a story of resistance towards slavery has symbolic importance in African American folklore and literary history.|$|E

30|$|Knowledge of {{the normal}} {{axillary}} anatomy aids in determining the underlying aetiology <b>of</b> <b>an</b> axillary <b>mass.</b> The differential diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>an</b> axillary <b>mass</b> is broad, including skin lesions, infections, haematoma, lymphadenopathy (hyperplastic, inflammatory, neoplastic or metastatic), accessory breast tissue, fibroadenoma, fibrocystic change, post-operative fluid collections, primary breast cancer and intramuscular neoplasms. For most cases, imaging evaluation entails diagnostic mammography and targeted ultrasound. If intervention is warranted, FNA or core needle biopsies are safe and accurate methods for diagnosis and for guiding the management <b>of</b> <b>an</b> axillary <b>mass.</b>|$|R

5|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mass</b> {{rapid transit}} for New Delhi first {{emerged from a}} traffic and travel {{characteristics}} study which {{was carried out in}} the city in 1969. Over the next several years, many official committees by a variety of government departments were commissioned to examine issues related to technology, route alignment, and governmental jurisdiction. In 1984,the Urban Arts Commission came up with a proposal for developing a multi-modal transport system, which would consist of constructing three underground mass rapid transit corridors as well augmenting the city's existing suburban railway and road transport networks.|$|E
5|$|The present era is {{classified}} as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mass</b> extinction event, the Holocene extinction event, the fastest ever to have occurred. Some, such as E. O.

The extent of the current extinction event is still being researched, debated and calculated by biologists.|$|E

5|$|Delius's first successes came in Germany, where Hans Haym {{and other}} {{conductors}} promoted his {{music from the}} late 1890s. In Delius's native Britain, it was 1907 before his music made regular appearances in concert programmes, after Thomas Beecham took it up. Beecham conducted the full premiere <b>of</b> <b>A</b> <b>Mass</b> of Life in London in 1909 (he had premiered Part II in Germany in 1908); he staged the opera A Village Romeo and Juliet at Covent Garden in 1910; and he mounted a six-day Delius festival in London in 1929, as well as making gramophone recordings of many of Delius's works. After 1918 Delius began to suffer the effects of syphilis, contracted during his earlier years in Paris. He became paralysed and blind, but completed some late compositions between 1928 and 1932 {{with the aid of}} an amanuensis, Eric Fenby.|$|E

Some Mass compositions, like for {{instance}} Rossini's Petite messe solennelle, do however contain parts outside the Ordinarium.

5|$|Early writers {{combined}} ctenophores with cnidarians into {{a single}} phylum called Coelenterata on account of morphological similarities between the two groups. Like cnidarians, the bodies of ctenophores consist <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mass</b> of jelly, with one layer of cells {{on the outside and}} another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, however, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only a single cell deep. Ctenophores also resemble cnidarians in relying on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration, as well as in having a decentralized nerve net rather than a brain. However, genomic studies have suggested that the neurons of Ctenophora, which differ in many ways from other animal neurons, evolved independently from those of the other animals, and increasing awareness {{of the differences between the}} groups has persuaded more recent authors to classify the two as separate phyla. The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores.|$|E
5|$|Kuntz was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} with the Marlins before spring training in 2002. The move was part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mass</b> firing of Marlins personnel in player development and scouting after the team's change in ownership. Kuntz, who was paid for the 2002 season in any case due {{to the terms of}} his contract, kept a job working on the grounds crew at the team's spring training site. He had performed ground crew duties at the site for several years in the offseasons. Late in the 2002 season, the Atlanta Braves hired Kuntz as a roving instructor. After the season, he was hired by the Pittsburgh Pirates as a first-base coach. In October 2005, the Pirates offered minor league positions to Kuntz and fellow coaches Gerald Perry and Alvaro Espinoza. He spent the next two seasons coaching between the Class AAA Indianapolis Indians and the major league club.|$|E
5|$|The {{edge of the}} gill is sterile, made up <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mass</b> of cystidia (cheilocystidia). The {{club-shaped}} cheilocystidia measure from 10 to 25 by 7 to 12μm, {{and sport}} multiple cylindrical appendages on their tips, measuring 1 to 7 by 1 to 1.5μm. The cheilocystidia are colourless, with cell walls of variable thickness, and are inamyloid. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia {{on the face of}} the gills). The caulocystidia (cystidia in the stem) measure 60 to 200 by 4 to 7µm. They are cylindrical and erect, forming the visible bristles. The tip is either pointed or rounded, and the cell walls are smooth and colourless, up to 2µm thick. They are dextrinoid, meaning they stain a reddish-brown when they come into contact with iodine from Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution.|$|E
