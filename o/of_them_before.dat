On 9 November, they moved by landing craft to Tasimboko and, on 10 November marched overland—guided by native scouts—toward Binu.

5|$|A. r. obscura, {{described}} by Donald R. Dickey and Adriaan van Rossem in 1923, {{is found in}} the Channel Islands of California on Santa Cruz, Anacapa, and formerly on Santa Catalina. While the Santa Catalina population has not been observed since 1863, the subspecies seems to have colonized Anacapa Island. No records exist <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>before</b> 1940. This subspecies is similar to A. r. canescens but is darker.|$|E
5|$|In a post-credits scene {{after the}} main game's ending, Zobek is seen alive during modern times, and has {{uncovered}} Gabriel {{living as a}} vampire called Dracula. Zobek mentions the acolytes of Satan are preparing for his return and that they must stop him before he takes revenge on both <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>Before</b> Gabriel disappears, Zobek tells him he will free him of his immortality if he helps him.|$|E

5|$|More than 1,000schools {{and churches}} were {{converted}} to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>before</b> the storm's arrival. The country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4emergency health kits and 1,000water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stock in nearby Haiti, ready to move them to Jamaica if they were needed, although damage to their airport ultimately prevented their distribution.|$|E
5|$|Along with Company F, {{which had}} {{returned}} to the base camp, Carlson proceeded to the area where Company C was engaged, arriving at 16:30. Carlson ordered Company F to attack the Japanese positions facing Company C at 17:15. In the meantime, the Japanese troops departed the area, which Company F soon confirmed. Leaving Company F at the scene, Carlson returned to Binu with Company C, arriving at 22:00. Company E arrived at Binu about the same time and reported that they had caught a Japanese company crossing a river in the open and killed many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>before</b> withdrawing. Carlson then took Company B and returned to the area that Company F was guarding, arriving at daybreak on 12 November. The Marines had suffered 10 killed in the day's actions and estimated that they had killed 120Japanese soldiers.|$|E
5|$|In , a new {{collectible}} item {{known as}} mini medals, resembling small gold coins with a five-pointed {{star in the}} middle, was introduced; {{they have nothing to}} do with winning the game, but they can be traded with a certain character for items. Players collect them throughout the game, primarily by opening chests, breaking pots and barrels, and searching in sacks and drawers. Horii introduced them as he wanted to have something players collected that were similar to the crests and orbs in the previous Dragon Quest games, but did not want to repeat the necessity for players having to collect a certain number <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>before</b> they could complete the game.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor and Clara find a {{location}} in the mansion which is noticeably colder {{than the rest of}} the house, and they feel as if they are being watched. Suddenly the house grows cold and Clara feels something holding her hand when there's nothing there. The two race back to where the Professor and Emma are waiting to see Palmer's equipment activating of its own accord. A thin black disc materializes in front of them and Emma senses something crying out for help as the ghost appears in a dark hallway crying for help. The Doctor quickly takes pictures <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>before</b> the disc vanishes and the house returns to normal.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{attempts}} {{to rescue the}} freighter Sanction, which is trapped in a star's magnetic field. An agreement is reached to transport over {{the crew of the}} freighter, but they surprisingly send over a cargo barrel first. The Enterprise crew {{attempts to}} transport the freighter's crew, but is only successful in recovering four <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>before</b> their ship is destroyed. Two, T'Jon (Merritt Butrick) and Romas (Richard Lineback), are scruffy and unshaven, while the other two, Sobi (Judson Scott) and Langor (Kimberly Farr), are groomed and well dressed. They all show relief that the barrel made it over, and little remorse for the lost ship and crewmen. Both groups start to fight over the ownership of the barrel, and are escorted to the observation lounge under guard.|$|E
5|$|Jamaica, {{which was}} {{forecast}} {{to bear the}} brunt of Hurricane Dean, underwent the most extensive preparations. The Jamaican government executed long-standing evacuation plans, including converting the country's national arena into a shelter and relocating inmates from two maximum security prisons. Political parties in the island suspended their campaigning for the August 27 national elections, to allow residents to prepare for the storm. Curfews were put in place for parts of the island, while off-duty essential personnel were called back to work. More than 1,000 schools and churches were converted to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>before</b> the storm's arrival. Evidently the country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4 emergency health kits and 1,000 water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stocks in nearby Haiti, ready to move them to Jamaica if they were needed. The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team tried to reach Jamaica, but only one member arrived before all incoming flights were canceled. The United States confirmed that it would offer aid if it was needed, and the North-West Caribbean Donor Group met to decide what actions would need to be taken.|$|E

5|$|Washington shared {{time at the}} Trail Blazers {{power forward}} spot with Maurice Lucas at first, but after Lucas' trade to the New Jersey Nets, he became the {{full-time}} starter. He played three seasons in Portland, during which he earned {{a spot in the}} 1980 NBA All-Star Game, after some of the top players sat out due to injury. During that All-Star weekend, which was held in Landover, Maryland, nearby American U. held a halftime ceremony in which they retired Washington's number. He was named a team captain for the following season. In his post-punch career, numerous players, coaches, and officials noted that he became less aggressive on the court out of fear of getting into another fight; something he never did. Washington started experiencing pain in his back and knees during the 1980–81 season. The pain became unbearable during the 1981–82 season, and he retired in January 1982 after missing all but 20 games. In 1987, after more than five years out of the league, he tried to make a comeback with the Warriors, but lasted only eight games on the roster (playing in six <b>of</b> <b>them)</b> <b>before</b> being cut.|$|E
