2500|$|Similarly, the Rabbis {{taught that}} when Rebekah died, her bier was not taken {{out in public}} because of Esau. When Rebekah died, the people asked who would go <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body, for Abraham had died, Isaac sat at home unable to see, Jacob had gone to Paddan Aram, and if Esau went <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> people would curse her for raising such a person as Esau. So they took her bier out at night. Rabbi Jose bar Hanina taught that because they took her bier out at night, Scripture does not openly {{describe}} her death, but only alludes to it in [...] Rabbi Jose bar Hanina read [...] to say, [...] "Deborah, Rebekah's nurse died, [...] [...] [...] and he called it the Weeping Oak," [...] for they wept twice, for while Jacob was mourning for Deborah, the news of Rebekah's death reached him. And thus [...] reports, [...] "and God appeared to Jacob again [...] [...] [...] and blessed him," [...] because God blessed Jacob with the mourners' blessing.|$|E

60|$|One night, two {{or three}} weeks after the bridal return, when the boy was gone to bed, Rhoda sat a long time over the turf ashes that she had raked <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> to {{extinguish}} them. She contemplated so intently the new wife, as presented to her in her mind's eye over the embers, that she forgot the lapse of time. At last, wearied with her day's work, she too retired.|$|E
60|$|And then {{at length}} came the last day, when, after passing the island, they had struck land {{again at the}} high white cliffs at Beachy Head. As evening fell the ship lay rolling in an oily calm, a league off from Winchelsea, with the long dark snout of Dungeness jutting <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> Next morning they would pick up their pilot at the Foreland, and Sir Charles might meet the king's ministers at Westminster before the evening. The {{boatswain}} had the watch, and the three friends were met for a last turn of cards in the cabin, the faithful American still serving as eyes to the Governor. There was a good stake upon the table, for the sailors had tried on this last night to win their losses back from their passenger. Suddenly he threw his cards down, and swept all the money {{into the pocket of}} his long-flapped silken waistcoat.|$|E

I have been studying hard with Mrs. Parker at the hotel, who seems to be an excellent housekeeper and accustomed to homely fare, and I have learned how to make and to cook a great many things which are simple and nutritious; I have had appropriate dresses made, and Maria has gone to town and bought me a great variety of household linen, all good and plain, for our damask table-cloths would look perfectly ridiculous here. I have also laid in a great many other things which you will see from time to time.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|There is a {{child of}} the Barney Williams's in this house--a little girl--to whom I {{presented}} a black doll when I was here last. I have seen her eye at the keyhole since I began writing this, and I think she and the doll are outside still. [...] "When you sent it up to me by the coloured boy," [...] she said after receiving it (coloured boy is the term for black waiter), [...] "I gave such a cream that ma came running in and creamed too, 'cos she fort I'd hurt myself. But I creamed a cream of joy." [...] She had a friend to play with her that day, and brought the friend with her, to my infinite confusion. A friend all stockings, and much too tall, who sat on the sofa very far back, with her stockings sticking stiffly <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> and glared at me and never spake word. Dolby found us confronted in a sort of fascination, like serpent and bird.|$|E
60|$|She sat half {{stunned by}} the {{prospect}} which was opening <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> Ambitious she had, as the Jesuit had surmised, always been-- ambitious for the power which would enable her to leave the world better than she found it. And this ambition she had already to some extent been able to satisfy, for more than once she had swayed both king and kingdom. But to marry the king--to marry the man for whom she would gladly lay down her life, whom {{in the depths of}} her heart she loved in as pure and as noble a fashion as woman ever yet loved man--that was indeed a thing above her utmost hopes. She knew her own mind, and she knew his. Once his wife, she could hold him to good, and keep every evil influence away from him. She was sure of it. She should be no weak Maria Theresa, but rather, as the priest had said, a new Jeanne d'Arc, come to lead France and France's king into better ways. And if, to gain this aim, she had to harden her heart against the Huguenots, at least the fault, if there were one, lay with those who made this condition rather than with herself. The king's wife! The heart of the woman and the soul of the enthusiast both leaped at the thought.|$|E

6000|$|So {{when this}} one {{came to the}} steading at West Inch I was not best pleased to see her. I was twelve at the time (it was in the holidays) and she eleven, a thin, tallish girl with black eyes and the queerest ways. She was for ever staring <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> with her lips parted, as if she saw {{something}} wonderful; but when I came behind her and looked the same way, I could see nothing but the sheep's trough or the midden, or father's breeches hanging on a clothes-line. And then if she saw a lump of heather or bracken, or any common stuff of that sort, she would mope over it, {{as if it had}} struck her sick, and cry, [...] "How sweet! how perfect!" [...] just {{as though it had been}} a painted picture. She didn't like games, but I used to make her play [...] "tig" [...] and such like; but it was no fun, for I could always catch her in three jumps, and she could never catch me, though she would come with as much rustle and flutter as ten boys would make. When I used to tell her that she was good for nothing, and that her father was a fool to bring her up like that, she would begin to cry, and say that I was a rude boy, and that she would go home that very night, and never forgive me as long as she lived. But in five minutes she had forgot all about it. What was strange was that she liked me a deal better than I did her, and she would never leave me alone; but she was always watching me and running after me, and then saying, [...] "Oh, here you are!" [...] as if it were a surprise.|$|E
