5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) {{is a group}} <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> {{secured to}} dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect {{to more than one}} implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species of}} Knoetschkesuchus {{have only two}} {{distinct}} types <b>of</b> <b>teeth,</b> uniquely among atoposaurids. Other atoposaurids have a third type of leaf-shaped teeth. The first type <b>of</b> <b>teeth,</b> found {{near the front of}} the jaw, are conical, slightly constricted at the base, and curved slightly inwards. A subtype is represented by the canine-like or pseudocaniniform teeth. They are the fourth and fifth maxillary teeth, and are enlarged (about twice the size of the other maxillary teeth), more pointed, and more constricted at the base. The second type <b>of</b> <b>teeth,</b> which constitutes the rest of the teeth, are shaped like thin lanceheads, with a wide base and a narrower tip; in K. guimarotae all of the tips are sharp, but in K. langenbergensis they gradually become blunter.|$|E
25|$|The Individual (personal) Tooth-Wear Index was {{developed}} to objectively quantify the degree <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> wear in an individual, without being affected by the number <b>of</b> missing <b>teeth.</b> Bruxism {{is not the only}} cause <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> wear. Another possible cause <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> wear is acid erosion, which may occur in people who drink a lot of acidic liquids such as concentrated fruit juice, or in people who frequently vomit or regurgitate stomach acid, which itself can occur for various reasons. People also demonstrate a normal level <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> wear, associated with normal function. The presence <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> wear only indicates that it had occurred {{at some point in the}} past, and does not necessarily indicate that the loss <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> substance is ongoing. People who clench and perform minimal grinding will also not show much tooth wear. Occlusal splints are usually employed as a treatment for bruxism, but they can also be of diagnostic use, e.g. to observe the presence or absence of wear on the splint after a certain period of wearing it at night.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a general}} {{perception}} that the problem <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> wear is increasing due to elements of the modern diet and due to increased retention of dentition into older age. Tooth wear encompasses erosion, abrasion and attrition of dental tissues – these often co-exist – yet in general, erosion is of more significance to the young and attrition is of more significance to the older population. Diet {{plays a significant role}} in the aetiology <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> wear and likewise advanced tooth wear in older age may impose dietary restrictions with consequences for dietary intake and nutritional status. There is a need to increase the awareness of the disease <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> wear and the associated nutritional problems. At present, the aetiology <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> wear is poorly understood – especially with respect to the role of diet. Clearer information on how best to measure and monitor the incidence and prevalence is needed in order to obtain longitudinal data on trends in tooth wear and to monitor the factors that contribute to this condition.

5|$|Because the key {{distinguishing}} characteristic Marsh {{noted for}} Pteranodon was its lack <b>of</b> <b>teeth,</b> any toothless pterosaur jaw fragment, wherever {{it was found}} in the world, tended to be attributed to Pteranodon during {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries. This resulted in a plethora of species and a great deal of confusion. The name became a wastebasket taxon, rather like the dinosaur Megalosaurus, to label any pterosaur remains that could not be distinguished other than by the absence <b>of</b> <b>teeth.</b> Species (often dubious ones now known to be based on sexual variation or juvenile characters) have been reclassified a number of times, and several subgenera have in the 1970s been erected by Halsey Wilkinson Miller to hold them in various combinations, further confusing the taxonomy (subgenera include Longicepia, Occidentalia, and Geosternbergia). Notable authors who have discussed the various aspects of Pteranodon include Bennett, Padian, Unwin, Kellner, and Wellnhofer. Two species, P. orogensis and P. orientalis, are not pteranodontids and have been renamed Bennettazhia oregonensis and Bogolubovia orientalis respectively.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of sharks dates from the Ordovician period, 450–420 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before many plants had colonized the continents. Only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans. The oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago, in the Silurian period. The first sharks looked very different from modern sharks. The majority of modern sharks {{can be traced back to}} around 100 million years ago. Most fossils are <b>of</b> <b>teeth,</b> often in large numbers. Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. The teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an apatite. When a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments.|$|E
5|$|The loss <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> {{with age}} in Limusaurus {{is the most}} extreme case of tooth {{morphology}} changing with age among dinosaurs. In fact, Limusaurus {{is one of the}} only known jawed vertebrates where teeth are completely lost during ontogeny (the others are the red mullet and striped red mullet, several armored catfish, and the platypus). Its complicated pattern of losing teeth from both the front and the back is most {{similar to that of the}} avialan Jeholornis. The temporary halt in tooth replacement likely results from the replacement tooth buds regressing, as in the veiled chameleon. Combined with the retention of the developmental signal pathways necessary to induce tooth development in birds, the ontogenetic replacement <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> by a beak in Limusaurus suggests that the development of beaks in other lineages of theropods, and indeed beaked animals in general, may be related to developmental changes that heterochronically alter the point at which tooth development halts.|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} {{temporal}} order <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> addition in the Australian lungfish where timing <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> induction is sequential {{in the same}} pattern as osteichthyans along the lower jaw. The order <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> initiation in Neoceratodus starts from the midline tooth, together with left and right ones at jaw position 2, followed by 3 and then 1. This is the pattern order for dentary <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> several teleosts and what we propose represents a stereotypic initiation pattern shared with all osteichthyans, including the living sister group to all tetrapods, the Australian lungfish. This is contrary to previous opinions that the lungfish dentition is otherwise derived and uniquely different. Sonic hedgehog (shh) expression is intensely focused on tooth positions at different times corresponding with their initiation order. This deployment of shh is required for lungfish tooth induction, as cyclopamine treatment results in complete loss <b>of</b> these <b>teeth</b> when applied before they develop. The temporal sequence <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> initiation is possibly regulated by shh and is know to be required for dentition pattern in other osteichthyans, including cichlid fish and snakes.

50|$|Dental {{attrition}} {{is a type}} <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> wear {{caused by}} tooth-to-tooth contact, resulting in loss <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> tissue, usually starting at the incisal or occlusal surfaces.

The pathological wear <b>of</b> the <b>tooth</b> surface can be caused by bruxism, which is clenching and grinding <b>of</b> the <b>teeth.</b> If the attrition is severe, the enamel can be completely worn away leaving underlying dentin exposed, resulting in an increased risk of dental caries and dentin hypersensitivity.
