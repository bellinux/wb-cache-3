5|$|Dragon Quest III: The Seeds <b>of</b> <b>Salvation</b> is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by Chunsoft {{and published by}} Enix (now Square Enix). It is the third installment in the Dragon Quest series (known as Dragon Warrior in North America {{at the time of}} its original release) and was first released for the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan and later for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in North America. The game saw an enhanced remake for the Super Famicom (the Japanese version of the Super NES) in 1996 and the Game Boy Color in 2001, and a port to mobile phones and the Wii in 2009 and 2011. A version of the game for Android and iOS was released in Japan on September 25, 2014, and worldwide as Dragon Quest III: The Seeds <b>of</b> <b>Salvation</b> on December 4, 2014. It was the first time the game was given an official English subtitle.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} {{end of all}} {{his writings}} is to inculcate bhakti addressed to Rama as the greatest means <b>of</b> <b>salvation</b> and emancipation from the chain of births and deaths, a salvation which is as free and open to men of the lowest caste as to Brahmins.|$|E
5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a {{corollary}} of the emphasis on theosis. In terms <b>of</b> <b>salvation,</b> humanity is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.|$|E

5|$|During the Reformation, Martin Luther {{rejected}} {{many of the}} Catholic Church's seven sacraments, but retained baptism and the Lord's Supper. He {{saw many}} practices of the medieval church as abuses of power intended to require work in order to merit forgiveness for sin after baptism rather than faith alone. Luther attached the promise <b>of</b> <b>salvation</b> to baptism, and taught that life after baptism should be spent in recollection {{of it and the}} dying to sin it signified.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the sixth book, Clement intends to demonstrate that the works of Greek poets were derived from the prophetic books of the Bible. In order to reinforce his position that the Greeks were inclined towards plagiarism, he cites numerous instances of such inappropriate appropriation by classical Greek writers, reported second-hand from On Plagiarism, an anonymous 3rd century BC work sometimes ascribed to Aretades. Clement then digresses to the subject of sin and hell, arguing that Adam was not perfect when created, but given the potential to achieve perfection. He espouses broadly universalist doctrine, holding that Christ's promise <b>of</b> <b>salvation</b> is available to all, even those condemned to hell.|$|E
5|$|Many vocalists were {{considered}} to perform on the album; Matheos and Portnoy briefly considered having a different vocalist perform on each track. Daniel Gildenlöw of Pain <b>of</b> <b>Salvation</b> wrote some vocal melodies and lyrics, but Moore ultimately performed most of the vocals and wrote most of the lyrics. Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree wrote lyrics and performed vocals on one track. Cynic and Gordian Knot bassist Sean Malone performed bass, but was credited as a guest musician because his schedule meant {{he was unable to}} join Matheos, Moore and Portnoy for the basic tracking sessions.|$|E

5|$|The Platonic {{influence}} on Maximus' thought {{can be seen}} most clearly in his theological anthropology. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of exitus-reditus (exit and return), teaching that humanity {{was made in the}} image of God, and the purpose <b>of</b> <b>salvation</b> is to restore us to unity with God. This emphasis on divinization or theosis helped secure Maximus' place in Eastern theology, as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.|$|E
5|$|The term baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{originates}} in the New Testament, and all Christian traditions {{accept it as}} a theological concept. Nevertheless, different Christian denominations and traditions have interpreted its meaning {{in a variety of}} ways due to differences in the doctrines <b>of</b> <b>salvation</b> and ecclesiology. As a result, Spirit baptism has been variously defined as part of the sacraments of initiation into the church, as being synonymous with regeneration, as being synonymous with Christian perfection, or as being a second work of grace that empowers a person for Christian life and service.|$|E
5|$|The {{western world}} learnt of Tiruvannamalai during the mid 20th century, {{through the work}} of Ramana Maharishi (1879–1950 CE). The cave where Ramana meditated is on the lower slopes of the Annamalai hills, with the ashram further down at the foothills. The {{basement}} of the raised hall inside the temple has the Patala Lingam, where Ramana attained supreme awareness while ants devoured his flesh. The place is also called a Mukthi Sthalam, meaning place <b>of</b> <b>salvation,</b> and saints like Seshadri Swamigal, Gugai Namachivayar and Yogi Ramsuratkumar {{have been associated with}} the temple.|$|E

5|$|The Eucharist {{was a key}} {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli {{it was a matter}} of attacking a doctrine that imperiled the understanding and reception of God's gift <b>of</b> <b>salvation,</b> while for Luther {{it was a matter of}} defending a doctrine that embodied that gift. It is not known what Zwingli's eucharistic theology was before he became a reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years as a priest. In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns the sacrifice of the mass, he states that it is a memorial of the sacrifice. He expounds on this in An Exposition of the Articles (1523).|$|E
5|$|The {{annexation}} of Portugal by Spain in 1580 {{opened the way}} for other European powers to follow the spice routes to India. The Dutch arrived first, closely followed by the British. The first English merchants arrived in Bombay in November 1583, and travelled through Bassein, Thane, and Chaul. The Portuguese Franciscans had obtained practical control of Salsette and Mahim by 1585, and built Nossa Senhora de Bom Concelho (Our Lady of Good Counsel) at Sion and Nossa Senhora de Salvação (Our Lady <b>of</b> <b>Salvation)</b> at Dadar in 1596. The Battle of Swally was fought between the British and the Portuguese at Surat in 1612 for the possession of Bombay. Dorabji Nanabhoy, a trader, was the first Parsi to settle in Bombay in 1640. Castella de Aguada (Fort of the Waterpoint) was built by the Portuguese at Bandra in 1640 as a watchtower overlooking the Mahim Bay, the Arabian Sea and the southern island of Mahim. The growing power of the Dutch {{by the middle of the}} seventeenth century forced the Surat Council of the British Empire to acquire Bombay from King John IV of Portugal in 1659. The marriage treaty of Charles II of England and Catherine of Portugal on 8 May 1661 placed Bombay in British possession as a part of Catherine's dowry to Charles.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Jenner {{encountered}} {{a group of}} men from the Glanton Exclusive Brethren {{standing in front of the}} National Australia Bank on Collins Street. One of the men was engaging in open-air preaching. Jenner interrupted the man to say that he would listen to the man's good news provided that he was allowed to share some good news first. The man agreed, so Jenner taught the group of Brethren how to play craps there on the pavement. One of the Brethren invited Jenner into his home for tea and told him about the gospel. Jenner converted to Christianity and, when he went home, told Jessie that she was a sinner bound for hell and therefore in need <b>of</b> <b>salvation.</b> According to Wilson's biography of Jenner, Jessie thought that Jenner had become manic or insane. They had a young daughter named Ann by this point and Jenner was gambling so much that he was not providing for his family. For both of these reasons, Jessie left Jenner and moved to Corowa to work on a farm, taking Ann with her. She said that she would return only when Jenner regained his sanity. On several occasions, he aggressively told Jessie's brothers that they needed to become Christians, which angered them. On one of these occasions, their conversation became physical and they began punching each other. The brothers rejected Jenner and were never reconciled to him. He wrote to his family back in England informing them of his conversion and asking them to become Christians too, but he received no reply.|$|E

5|$|The {{coal mining}} {{industry}} of the Rhondda was artificially buoyed {{throughout the war}} years, though there were expectations {{of a return to}} the pre-1939 industrial collapse {{after the end of the}} Second World War. There was a sense <b>of</b> <b>salvation</b> when the government announced the nationalisation of the British Coalmines in 1947; but the following decades saw a continual reduction in the output from the Rhondda mines. From 15,000 miners in 1947, Rhondda had just a single pit within the valleys producing coal in 1984, located at Maerdy. The decline in the mining of coal after World War II was a country wide issue, but South Wales and Rhondda were affected to a higher degree than other areas of Britain. Oil had superseded coal as the fuel of choice in many industries and there was political pressure influencing the supply of oil. Of the few industries that were still reliant on coal, the demand was for quality coals, especially coking coal which was required by the steel industry. Fifty percent of Glamorgan coal was now supplied to steelworks, with the second biggest market being domestic heating, which the 'smokeless' coal of the Rhondda became once again fashionable after the publication of the Clean Air Act. These two markets now controlled the fate of the mines in the Rhondda, and as demand fell from both sectors the knock-on effect on the mining industry was further contraction. In addition exports to other areas of Europe, traditionally France, Italy and the Low Countries, experienced a massive decline; from 33 per cent around the start of the 20th century to roughly 5 per cent by 1980.|$|E
