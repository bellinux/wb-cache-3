25|$|Following hibernation, nests will be {{initiated}} between March and May {{by one or}} two foundresses or queens. During this period, cell construction is high as queens are laying eggs {{at a rate of}} 0.5 eggs per day. Construction by the queen slows down once eggs begin to hatch, but will increase again when pupae appear. If there are two foundresses for the colony, then <b>one</b> <b>becomes</b> the dominant egg-layer and leaves the nest less frequently than the other. Typically, the dominant queen will eat the eggs laid by the other foundress.|$|E
25|$|In part two, Unger {{attempts}} {{to explain how}} <b>one</b> <b>becomes</b> capable of passion. He charts out a path by which the individual first has desire, which is then augmented with imagination. The imagination reveals an insatiability of the infinite sense of self, which is but then contingent upon the acceptance of others. With this recognition, then, the contingency of the self is revealed. With the further realization of death we come to see that nothing outside of the self can fulfill desire; {{we want to see}} the self as transcending all of the fixed social world.|$|E

25|$|Deftly {{traversing}} {{between the}} diverse mediums like painting, video, installation and photography, Rashid Rana {{has emerged as}} one of the leading artist of his generation, making his presence felt globally. His work deals with everyday issues encompassing a wide range of themes from urbanization and popular culture to faith and tradition. He often employs video installations and still photography. A case in point is his series of composite photomontages in which each main image is constructed out of countless smaller photos of diametrically opposite subjects. The viewer confronts a moment of sudden withdrawal after moving closer to the picture when <b>one</b> <b>becomes</b> aware of the several tiny images that constitute the larger one.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the process}} of {{recapitulation}} is for Christ to go through every stage of human life, from infancy to old age, and simply by living it, sanctify it with his divinity. Although it is sometimes claimed that Irenaeus believed Christ did not die until he was older than is conventionally portrayed, the bishop of Lyon simply pointed out that because Jesus turned the permissible age for becoming a rabbi (30 years old and above), he recapitulated and sanctified the period between 30 and 50 years old, as per the Jewish custom of periodization on life, and so touches the beginning of old age when <b>one</b> <b>becomes</b> 50 years old. (see Adversus Haereses, book II, chapter 22).|$|E
25|$|Bektashism is also initiatic {{and members}} must {{traverse}} various levels or ranks as they progress along the spiritual {{path to the}} Reality. First level members are called aşıks عاشق. They are those who, while not having taken initiation into the order, are nevertheless drawn to it. Following initiation (called nasip) <b>one</b> <b>becomes</b> a mühip محب. After some time as a mühip, one can take further vows and become a dervish. The next level above dervish is that of baba. The baba (lit. father) {{is considered to be}} the head of a tekke and qualified to give spiritual guidance (irshad إرشاد). Above the baba is the rank of halife-baba (or dede, grandfather). Traditionally there were twelve of these, the most senior being the dedebaba (great-grandfather). The dedebaba was considered to be the highest ranking authority in the Bektashi Order. Traditionally the residence of the dedebaba was the Pir Evi (The Saint's Home) which was located in the shrine of Hajji Bektash Wali in the central Anatolian town of Hacıbektaş (Solucakarahüyük).|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} main {{geographical}} regions which Montana must control {{to complete the}} game; Little Havana, Downtown, South Beach and North Beach. At {{the start of the}} game, the entire map is available to explore, but Montana cannot carry out missions, attack rival gangs or purchase property anywhere except Little Havana. Each turf must be controlled 100% before the next <b>one</b> <b>becomes</b> available for missions. Acquiring 100% requires the player to perform certain actions within each region; purchase a certain number of fronts, eliminate rival gangs and carry out smaller missions involving purchasing and selling cocaine. To purchase fronts, Montana must perform a mission for the owner before they will sell the business to him - these missions, coupled with storyline missions, form the core of the main game. Once purchased, fronts can come under attack from rival gangs. To combat this, Montana can install security cameras to alert him to an imminent attack and guards to fend off attackers until he arrives on the scene. Once he has purchased the requisite number of fronts in a region, he must then take control of that region's storehouse, which will be in the possession of a rival gang.|$|E
500|$|According to the Upanishad, {{the entire}} {{universe}} evolves by Sankalpa (a thinking, ideation process), <b>one</b> <b>becomes</b> what one thinks, metaphysics affects physics, and it is ideation that helps retain the appearances of the world. Following renunciation from this universe, which is also called a Sankalpa, the meditating mind is {{to be focused on}} the Nirvikalpa (the unchangeable) or the unchangeable part (metaphysical reality). Varaha in verse 2.64 compares the [...] "samsara" [...] (cycle of rebirth) to the domain of karma, states Billington, one that is like a long dream ("swapna"), a delusion, a sea of sorrow. It defines jivanmukta as someone who has overcome and attained liberation from this samsara through self-knowledge.|$|E
