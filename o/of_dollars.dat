In fact, we see an increase in BMI when dollar stores leave a child's neighborhood. Given the proliferation <b>of</b> <b>dollar</b> stores in rural and low-income urban areas, the question <b>of</b> whether <b>dollar</b> stores are contributing to high rates of childhood obesity is policy relevant. However, our results provide some evidence that exposure to dollar stores is not a causal factor...|$|R
