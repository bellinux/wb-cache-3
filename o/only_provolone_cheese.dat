40|$|Abstract. In this paper, <b>Provolone</b> <b>Cheeses</b> were radialized by 60 Co-γ of {{different}} doses, {{and they were}} stored. The impact of texture in the cheese after radialization was studied, the peculiar smell resulted from radialization were analyzed, the mechanisms and preventing methods were discussed. Main conclusions are as follows: Volatile flavors of <b>Provolone</b> <b>cheeses</b> {{of different}} radialization doses were detected by HS-SPME-GC-MS. The result showed that the variety and quantity of volatile flavors were changed obviously after radicalization: esters and phenols were reduced numerously; while aldehydes, ketones, aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl olefin had increased significantly; Irradiation cause sulfur compounds such as sulfur alcohols and sulfur ketone...|$|R

40|$|Lactobacillus helveticus is a homofermentative {{thermophilic}} {{lactic acid}} bacterium that {{is used in the}} manufacture of Swiss type and long-ripened Italian cheeses, such as Emmental, Grana, and <b>Provolone</b> <b>cheeses.</b> Substantial differences in several technologically important characteristics are found among L. helveticus strains isolated from natural dairy starter cultures. In the present study we investigated the genotypic diversity of 74 strains isolated from different dairy cultures used for manufacturing Grana and <b>Provolone</b> <b>cheeses</b> and six collection strains. A restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of both total genomic DNA and the 16 S rRNA gene (ribotyping) was used as genotypic fingerprinting. A multivariate statistical analysis of the data enabled us to identify significant genotypic heterogeneity in L. helveticus. We found that genotypic fingerprinting could be used to distinguish strains; in particular, it was possible to associate the presence of specific strain genotypes with dairy ecosystem sources (e. g., Grana or <b>Provolone</b> <b>cheese).</b> Our data contribute to the description of microbial heterogeneity in L. helveticus and provide a more solid basis for understanding the functional and ecological significance of the presence of different L. helveticus biotypes in natural dairy starter cultures...|$|R
50|$|A mortadella {{sandwich}} is any sandwich using mortadella, a large Italian sausage, {{and is a}} {{very popular}} sandwich in Brazil especially São Paulo. The sandwich is made from nearly a half of a pound of mortadella sausage, <b>Provolone</b> <b>cheese,</b> sourdough bread, mayonnaise and Dijon mustard.|$|R
50|$|Another Italian roll {{sandwich}} popularized in Philadelphia by Italian immigrants is {{the roast}} pork Italian, or Italian roast pork sandwich, {{a variation of}} the Italian street food dish known as porchetta.

50|$|The Gerber is an {{open faced}} {{sandwich}} made in St. Louis, Missouri. The Gerber consists of a half section of Italian or French bread, spread with garlic butter and topped with ham, and Provel or <b>Provolone</b> <b>cheese,</b> seasoned with a sprinkling of paprika and then toasted.|$|R
50|$|The slow cooking of {{the onions}} is {{especially}} important for the sauce's flavor, and is facilitated by incremental additions of white wine, stock, or both. The sauce and accompanying pasta can be served with the meat from the sauce or separately, garnished with tomatoes, and topped with Parmesan or <b>provolone</b> <b>cheese.</b>|$|R
50|$|Variations exist, {{in which}} {{different}} cheeses and ingredients may be added. Some versions may also use oregano, olives and capers as ingredients, and some may omit {{the use of}} pizza sauce and substitute half of the mozzarella with <b>Provolone</b> <b>cheese</b> that is sliced or grated. Some versions may use pecorino cheese.|$|R

5|$|An {{example of}} a {{processed}} pizza cheese is Provel, which uses Cheddar, Swiss, and <b>Provolone</b> <b>cheeses</b> as flavorants. Some analogue types are made with casein, a by-product of milk, and vegetable oil, rather than milk fat. Casein-based Mozzarella-like imitation processed cheeses prepared using rennet are also used as a Mozzarella substitute on frozen pizzas.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{making no}} claims to {{originality}} in the concept, D'Angelo's established {{itself as a}} purveyor of steak and cheese sandwiches endemic to the Northeastern United States. The [...] "Number 9" [...] (so named for its initial place on the menu) consists of finely chopped steak, mushrooms, onions, peppers, and melted American cheese. This is also available as a [...] "Steak Bomb," [...] a spicier variant with genoa salami, ham capicola and melted <b>provolone</b> <b>cheese.</b>|$|R
5000|$|White American <b>cheese,</b> {{along with}} <b>provolone</b> <b>cheese,</b> are the {{favorites}} {{due to their}} mild flavor and medium consistency. Some establishments melt the American cheese to achieve the creamy consistency, while others place slices over the meat, letting them melt slightly under the heat. Philadelphia Inquirer restaurant critic Craig LaBan says [...] "Provolone is for aficionados, extra-sharp for the most discriminating among them." [...] Geno's owner, Joey Vento, said, [...] "We always recommend the provolone. That's the real cheese." ...|$|R
50|$|Small discs {{of locally}} {{produced}} <b>provolone</b> <b>cheese</b> of 10 to 15 cm {{in diameter and}} 1 to 2 cm in height are often eaten {{at the start of}} an asado, before the grilled meat. The provolone, often topped with chilli and oregano, is placed directly on the grill, on small stones or inside a foil plate, and cooked until part-melted. The provoleta may be seasoned with chimichurri, a mixture of oils and spices, and is usually eaten communally with bread.|$|R
50|$|The {{best known}} {{processed}} cheese in the United States is marketed as American cheese by Kraft Foods, Borden, and other companies. It is orange, yellow, or off-white; mild, with a medium consistency; and melts easily. It is typically {{made from a}} blend of cheeses, most often Colby and cheddar. Another type of processed cheese created in the United States is Provel pasteurized processed pizza cheese, which uses cheddar, Swiss, and <b>provolone</b> <b>cheeses</b> as flavorants. Provel cheese is commonly used in St. Louis-style pizza. A third variety of processed pizza cheeses are mozzarella-like imitation processed cheeses, which are sometimes used in frozen pizzas.|$|R
50|$|St. Louis-style pizza often, but not always, {{includes}} a white processed cheese known as Provel. Provel is a trademark for three cheeses fused to form one (provolone, Swiss, and white Cheddar), {{used instead of}} (or, rarely, in addition to) the mozzarella or provolone common to other styles of pizza. Provel cheese {{was developed by the}} St. Louis firm Costa Grocery in the 1950s and is made in Wisconsin primarily for the St. Louis market. The cheese is not widely available outside the St. Louis area but can be made by combining Swiss, sharp cheddar and smoked <b>provolone</b> <b>cheeses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Provel [...] {{is a white}} {{processed}} cheese particularly popular in St. Louis cuisine, that {{is a combination of}} cheddar, Swiss, and <b>provolone</b> <b>cheeses,</b> and tastes nothing like any of them. Provel has a low melting point, and therefore has a gooey and almost buttery texture at room temperature. It is the traditional topping for St. Louis-style pizza. It is also often used in the preparation of cheese soup and served on salads, chicken, and the Gerber sandwich. Some restaurants use Provel for their pasta dishes with white sauce instead of the customary fresh Italian cheese and cream.|$|R
40|$|Newly {{produced}} <b>Provolone</b> <b>cheeses</b> {{are traditionally}} coated with melted wax to prevent development of undesirable microorganisms. To establish whether wax could {{be replaced by}} other materials so as to simplify processing and reduce costs, a copolymer dispersion (Plasticoat) and a heat-shrinkable film (Cryovac) were used {{in place of the}} control wax. Effects on cheese ripening coeff. (ratio of water-soluble to total N), dynanometric properties (Texture Profile Analysis, penetration, recovery), consistency and moisture content were determined during 150 days of ripening. The Cryovac coating gave results comparable to those obtained with the wax coating, but the relatively high permeability of the Plasticoat facilitated moisture loss, thereby negatively influencing cheese proteolytic processes and rheological characteristics...|$|R
5000|$|Chicken parmigiana, {{or chicken}} {{parmesan}} [...] (also referred to colloquially in the United States as 'chicken parm' and in Australia as a [...] "parmy" [...] (also but less commonly as a parma or parmi)) {{is a popular}} Italian-American dish. It consists of a breaded chicken breast topped with tomato sauce and mozzarella, parmesan or <b>provolone</b> <b>cheese.</b> A slice of ham or bacon is sometimes added, but not all chefs are {{in agreement with the}} addition of pork. It has been speculated that the dish is based on a combination of the Italian melanzane alla Parmigiana, a dish using breaded eggplant slices instead of chicken, along with costelette Parmigiana (the latter generally served without sauce or cheese in Italy).|$|R

It consists of a bun, lettuce, tomato, mayo, American <b>cheese,</b> <b>provolone</b> <b>cheese,</b> ham, sauteed onions, mushrooms, a 12 ounce burger, bacon, cheddar cheese, hot peppers, and another 12 ounce burger. The burger also comes with house made kettle chips and a pickle spear. [...] The burger was featured on the Travel Channel's TV show Man v. Food (season 1) where the host, Adam Richman, ate a Thurman burger and was then introduced to the Thurmanator. [...] Richman explains the Thurmanator originated as the preferred fuel for competitors in the Arnold Classic bodybuilding competition. The burger was not listed on the menu {{at the time of the}} Man v. Food taping (originally aired December 10, 2008), but has since been added.|$|R
25|$|Although asado is eaten {{all over}} the country, its origin may {{be traced back to}} the Pampas. It entails {{manifold}} types of meat, which are generally eaten as follows: achuras (offal, or the cow's inner parts), morcilla (blood sausage), and sometimes also a provoleta (a piece of <b>provolone</b> <b>cheese</b> cooked on the grill with oregano) are eaten first. Then comes the choripán (a kind of spiced sausage made with pork or lamb and placed between two slices of bread), and lastly meat such as asado de tira, vacío (flank steak), lomo (tenderloin), colita de cuadril (rump), matambre (rolled stuffed steak cut into slices and served cold), entraña (innards); the list is never-ending. It is quite common to eat and enjoy a dish known as cabrito al asador (roast kid or goat) in the province of Córdoba.|$|R

40|$|Lactobacillus helveticus is the {{dominant}} organism in natural starter cultures used {{for the production of}} typical Italian cheeses. In this study, 74 L. helveticus strains, isolated from grana and <b>provolone</b> <b>cheese</b> natural whey starters, were distinguished with respect to their origin by using both cell wall protein profiles and chemometric evaluation of some phenotypic parameters, such as the ability to acidify cultures and the presence of nonspecific proteolytic and peptidase activities. Cell wall protein patterns allowed L. helveticus strains to be distinguished with respect to their source of isolation. Among the different phenotypes studied, no single specific parameter permitted the two groups of strains to be separated. A good discrimination between the two groups of L. helveticus species was obtained by multivariate statistical techniques, which permitted the extraction of all of the discriminating information retained in the phenotypic activities. Associations between strain phenotype expression and dairy environmental ecosystem source are discussed...|$|R
