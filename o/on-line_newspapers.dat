40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} I {{describe}} a genre analysis for <b>on-line</b> <b>newspapers,</b> revealing how their mediating form affect news related activities. A repertoire of elements was {{developed during the}} analysis of three <b>on-line</b> <b>newspapers,</b> to describe them. It is a repertoire of content, information structure and interaction elements together with with a repertoire of mediationg roles. The analysis {{in terms of the}} repertoire of elements revealed that the papers support activities unsupported by the printed papers, constituting a genre development. The analysis suggest that the genre is still a variant of the newspaper. It revealed a cosiderable space for development of the genre, supporting novel news related activities. However, it also revealed some problems which must be overcome by the mediators, if the papers are developed along the suggested lines. Furthermore it revealed some problems when using these popular formats for other purposes at other sites, and some problems with their current treatment of the digital material. ...|$|E

40|$|Video {{popularity}} characterization, in a News-on-demand service, is {{the core}} issue of this paper. It will concentrate on the digital edition of six Spanish regional newspapers, where the different news articles are classified into {{a wide variety of}} issues. Request video data has been analyzed, including how accesses were distributed along the different topics, during a period of nine months, where the number of requests fluctuated between 85, 758 and 586, 398 over a minimum of 519 videos and a maximum of 4, 221. On the one hand, the statistical function from which video popularity would come from is likely to be unknown. The problem has been tackled with some statistical functions, such as Zipf-like, Mandelbrot and Stretched,which are well-known in the literature. Another method called Box-Cox transformation has been looked into for this specific field. On the other hand, a brief overview has been carried out about the popularity growth tendency, that is how many days a video takes to reach the totality of its requests, and if requests are focused on a small number of videos or they are spread, known as temporal locality. In the end, after an inference and validation process, Box-Cox transformation {{turned out to be the}} best choice for the majority of the <b>on-line</b> <b>newspapers.</b> Moreover, the topic related to regional news captured the highest number of requests, so highlighting their regional nature. Finally, new videos achieved 80 % of their requests in their first day of life in most of the newspapers, and in four out of six <b>on-line</b> <b>newspapers</b> a high percentage of requests were concentrated on a low percentage of videos (Principle of Pareto) ...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the demise}} of the Berlin Wall and communism, many African {{countries}} have adopted a Western-model democracy as a system of governance. However, the media has not been liberalised to reflect this new discourse as constraints in many African countries pertaining to press freedom still exist. The internet appears to have the potential to challenge the political power of governments (Tsagarousianou, 1998 : 167). It has been posited that {{it has the potential to}} offer more platforms for information especially in the case of restrictive media environments. This study set out to investigate the impact of on-line publishing in Malawi. It explored how the emergence of this new form of publishing through the internet has affected the public sphere, democracy and press freedom in Malawi. The main focus was the level of press freedom at <b>on-line</b> <b>newspapers</b> as compared to traditional newspapers. It used the public sphere theory and literature on the internet as a technology of freedom as its theoretical framework. Using a case study approach by focusing on two newspapers; Nyasatimes on-line and Daily Times, the study used the coup plot coverage in May 2008 in Malawi by both newspapers as reference for the measurement of the level of press freedom. The study used qualitative content analysis and semi-structured interviews as its research methods. The research revealed that Nyasatimes enjoys more freedom to publish and therefore appears to have more press freedom than its more traditional counterpart. However, Nyasatimes also faces some unique challenges. The findings also revealed that press freedom in Malawi is not only affected by government through legislation but other factors and players as well play a central role in determining the level of press freedom for traditional media. The study therefore concludes that despite the internet’s ability to transcend local regimes of authority and censorship pertaining to press freedom, the challenges facing traditional media still need to be addressed as it is the primary source of information for most people in Malawi with <b>on-line</b> <b>newspapers</b> being simply supplementary...|$|E

Indeed, adaptive web services have the ability to deal with different users' needs for enhancing usability and comprehension and for dealing with large repositories. Nowadays, it is not sufficient for a newspaper to provide raw information (news wires of Press Agencies). One of the most important task of journalists is to select, synthesize and analyze information and events for his readers. Special reports seem to be the most representative journalists' task.
