5|$|Mansaf is a {{traditional}} meal in the central West Bank and Naqab region in the southern West Bank, having its roots from the Bedouin population of ancient Arabia. It is mostly cooked on occasions such as, during holidays, weddings or a large gathering. Mansaf is cooked as a lamb leg or large pieces <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> {{on top of a}} taboon bread that has usually been smothered with yellow rice. A type of thick and dried cheesecloth yogurt from goat's milk, called jameed, is poured on top of the lamb and rice to give it its distinct flavor and taste. The dish is also garnished with cooked pine nuts and almonds. The classic form of eating mansaf is using the right hand as a utensil. For politeness, participants in the feast tear pieces of meat to hand to the person next to them.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Diane Ruggiero and directed by John T. Kretchmer, marking Ruggiero's sixteenth and penultimate writing credit and Kretchmer's twelfth directing credit. One scene in the episode depicts Veronica and Max sitting {{in the backseat of}} a vehicle with Chelsea's pimp (a woman) and several bodyguards. Kretchmer decided to place one of the physically domineering bodyguards between Max and Veronica for comedic effect. In addition, Thomas noted that the actress of the pimp, Jackie Debatin, appeared in a similar role in an episode of The Office several weeks after the episode aired. The scene in which Keith, in a Sheriff's uniform, spots Don Lamb in his car was difficult to edit because although there was initially no radio music playing, Michael Muhney, the actor <b>of</b> <b>Lamb,</b> was moving his mouth as if singing lyrics. Thomas reported difficulty in finding a song that would match the movements.|$|E

5|$|Mammalian prey {{includes}} rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, raccoons (Procyon lotor), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), beavers (Castor canadensis), {{and deer}} fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the Chesapeake Bay area, bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons. Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. On San Juan Island in Washington, introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles. In landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals {{that occur in}} colonies or local concentrations, such as prairie dogs (Cynomys) and jackrabbits (Lepus). Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially sheep (Ovis aries). There {{are a handful of}} proven cases <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> predation, some of specimens weighing up to , by bald eagles but they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Market lamb {{production}} usually requires {{a short period}} of time. The success of production is therefore dependent upon the growth rate <b>of</b> the <b>lambs</b> which is influenced by milk yields of the ewes. Different growth potentials of animals result from a difference in their utilisation of food. Since metabolism affects the blood constituents which can be measured, it was the objective of this experiment to study the variations of blood amino acid and urea nitrogen levels <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> and their dams during the suckling period. The relationship between constituents and the relationship of each constituent with weight and age <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> were studied. Also relationships of blood constituents of ewes with blood constituents, weights and ages <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> were studied. Five breeds of sheep were used: Willamette, Suffolk, Columbia, Dorset Horn and Border Cheviot. Weights <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> were recorded {{at the same time as}} blood samples were taken from lambs and their dams. The experiment was conducted for seven two-week periods during the Winter and Spring of 1962. Blood amino acid and urea nitrogen levels were found to be associated with growth <b>of</b> <b>lambs.</b> Blood amino acid nitrogen levels <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> were different due to breeds (P <. 01) but not due to periods, while urea nitrogen levels of the blood were different due to periods and types of birth (P <. 01). Suffolks showed the highest level of blood amino acid nitrogen, a level of 7. 84 mg. whereas Columbias gave a value of 7. 23 mg. per 100 ml. of blood which was the lowest level. Twins had lower levels of blood urea nitrogen than singles and both groups showed a steady decrease in the concentrations of urea as they became older and larger. The correlation coefficient between these constituents was highly significant, whereas no relationship was found within periods between either constituent and weights or ages <b>of</b> <b>lambs.</b> Body weight <b>of</b> the <b>lambs</b> was highly correlated with age. In the case of ewes, blood constituents were associated with milk yields and growth <b>of</b> <b>lambs.</b> Both constituents showed effects of breeds and periods. While blood amino acid levels were not extremely variable, blood urea nitrogen levels markedly increased at the second period then steadily decreased until the end of the experiment. Blood amino acid nitrogen levels of ewes were highly correlated with those <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> (P <. 01), while this relationship was not detected for blood urea nitrogen. A negative correlation coefficient between blood urea nitrogen levels of ewes and body weights <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> was highly significant (P <. 01) in Willamettes, Suffolks, and Columbias, while in Dorset Horns and Border Cheviots it was not significant.

40|$|This {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{to study the}} milk yield of Corriedale ewes and the liveweight <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> produced from those ewes with special reference to {{the relation of the}} milk yield to the growth from birth to weaning <b>of</b> suckling <b>lambs.</b> The animals used were 7 Corriedale ewes of 3 years of age and 9 Iambs (singles 5, twins 4) born from those ewes in the spring, 1957 at the Chugoku Stock Breeding Farm of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry. The milk yield of ewes was estimated from the difference of the liveweight <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> weighed before and after suckling and the records of the milk yeild of ewes and of the liveweight <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> were taken at 10 days intervals after birth. The results obtained were as follows : (1) It was found that the milk yield of ewes was highest during the period from 10 to 20 days after lambing and then gradually declined. (2) It seems that the ewes of higher milk yield during the first one month after lambing are greater on the average daily milk production during each 10 days period after lambing and on the total milk production during three months, as compared with those of lower milk yield. (3) Significant correlations were not found between the total milk yield of ewes during three months after lambing and their liveweight on the lambing day and between the former and the liveweight <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> on the day <b>of</b> <b>lambing.</b> (4) Average total milk yield during three months from birth to weaning was 83. 3 kg and the average daily weight gain per single lamb 240 g. (5) There were a few significant correlations between the milk yield of ewes during each one month period and during three months period and the liveweight gains <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> after birth and was generally a increasing tendency of the correlation coefficient values, as lambs grew older. It seems that those tendencies need further investigation. (6) However, a significent correlation (r=+ 0. 91) was found between the total milk yield of ewes and the average daily weight gain <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> during three months period from lambing to weaning. (7) It was found that the correlations between the average daily liveweight gain <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> during three months period and the liveweight of ewes on the lambing day and between the former and the birth weight <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> were not significant...|$|R
