25|$|When Powell was 13, he {{was kicked}} in the face by the family mule, {{breaking}} his jaw. The break healed {{in a manner that}} made the left side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw</b> more prominent.|$|E
2500|$|Serpico {{was then}} {{shot in the}} face by the suspect, with a [...]22 LR pistol, and the bullet struck just below the eye lodging at the top <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw.</b> He fired back, fell to the floor, and began to bleed profusely. His police colleagues refused to make a [...] "10-13" [...] {{dispatch}} to police headquarters indicating that an officer had been shot. An elderly man {{who lived in the}} next apartment called the emergency services reporting that a man had been shot and stayed with Serpico. When a police car arrived, aware that Serpico was a fellow officer, they transported him in the patrol car to Greenpoint Hospital.|$|E
2500|$|Cash {{enlisted in}} the United States Air Force on July 7, 1950. After basic {{training}} at Lackland Air Force Base and technical training at Brooks Air Force Base, both in San Antonio, Texas, Cash {{was assigned to the}} 12th Radio Squadron Mobile of the U.S. Air Force Security Service at Landsberg, Germany as a Morse Code operator intercepting Soviet Army transmissions. It was there he created his first band, named [...] "The Landsberg Barbarians". He was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant on July 3, 1954, and returned to Texas. During his military service, he acquired a distinctive scar on the right side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw</b> as a result of surgery to remove a cyst.|$|E
60|$|He {{moved the}} {{umbrella}} in indication and tittered again. Cranly, {{who was still}} chewing the fig, answered with loud movements <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaws.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Biscuits," [...] he {{said with}} an {{elaborate}} working <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaws,</b> intended to convey {{the idea that they}} were going to be specially delicious.|$|R
60|$|The young Englishman made {{no reply}} {{but it was}} evident from the set <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaws</b> that the Negroes would get little {{enjoyment}} out of him.|$|R
2500|$|On November 11–19, 1925 Dr. Douglas Derry and Dr. Saleh Bey Hamdi {{along with}} Carter {{and other members}} of the {{expedition}} team began to examine the mummy. It was initially very difficult for the team to unwrap it because it appeared that the anointing oils that were most likely used during the mummification ceremony had caused the mummy to stick to the casket. Although the wrappings were in poor [...] condition, it seemed they were of the same material as that which other kings from the period had been wrapped in. As each layer was removed, the team began to discover many fine objects wrapped between the layers all over Tutankhamun's body, including gold jewelry, daggers, and pieces of armor. Once the layers had been removed and they could finally begin to examine the actual corpse, they began to make anatomical notes on the body. He was determined to have been approximately 5 feet, 6inches and to have had a slight build with a slightly curved spine. Small bone fragments from the skull were found inside the skull, and a lesion was discovered on the left side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw,</b> but because the chest cavity was filled with wrappings, no further examination of it was done.|$|E
60|$|Martin made a queer {{movement}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw,</b> then smiled. That smile {{seemed to}} madden Thyme. She wrenched her wrist away and darted after Hilary.|$|E
60|$|But the other, {{with the}} same imperturbable face, {{motionless}} save for the rhythm <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw</b> muscles, walked quietly over {{and closed the door}} upon the inside.|$|E
60|$|The Guatemalan general {{arrested for}} a moment the rhythmic action <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaws,</b> lowered <b>his</b> paper and looked at her with raised eyebrows. At first Jill thought that he was {{registering}} haughty contempt, then she saw what she had taken for scorn was surprise.|$|R
60|$|As Mainmast here entered to {{announce}} that the pig was ready for consumption, the amazed mariner was led to a rich repast under the neighbouring banyan-tree. Here he was bereft of speech for a considerable time, whether owing to the application <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaws</b> to food, or increased astonishment, {{it is difficult to}} say.|$|R
50|$|Cardona Jr. {{began by}} acting in his father's films {{and then took}} over his father's craft in the mid-1960s, directing, writing, and {{producing}} over a hundred films over the years. He enjoyed some notoriety and success particularly in the late 1970s as a result <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>Jaws</b> (1975) inspired film Tintorera (1977) which became a cult classic.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rafford Townsend!" [...] exclaimed Hartley, with a grim {{tightening}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw.</b> [...] "How {{did that}} man {{come to know}} you? After all I've done for him--" ...|$|E
60|$|The grimness of Gunch's voice, the {{hardness}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw,</b> disconcerted Babbitt, but {{he recovered}} {{and went on}} till they looked bored, then irritated, then as doubtful as Gunch.|$|E
60|$|Don Pepe {{stroked his}} grey and pendant moustache, whose fine ends hung {{far below the}} {{clean-cut}} line <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw,</b> and spoke with a conscious pride in his reputation.|$|E
60|$|Stevie’s face {{lengthened}} considerably. He was thinking. The {{more intense}} his thinking, the slacker was the droop <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lower <b>jaw.</b>|$|R
50|$|Steven Spielberg {{originally}} {{wanted to}} have a hand in producing the movie until the success <b>of</b> <b>his</b> film <b>Jaws</b> got <b>his</b> full attention.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a savage}} beast it is!" [...] the man said; [...] "I would sooner face a whole company of you Scots than get within reach <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaws.</b> Dickon," [...] {{he went on}} as another soldier, on hearing the growl, issued {{from one of the}} smaller tents which stood in rear of the pavilion, [...] "the earl has sent this Scot to relieve you of your charge of the dog; he is to have the care of him in future." ...|$|R
60|$|She saw {{the muscles}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw</b> tighten,--a manner {{he had when}} earnest or determined,--and she {{wondered}} in agitation whether he divined {{what she was going}} to say. He turned his face slowly to hers, and his eyes were troubled.|$|E
60|$|There was a tense pause. A drop of {{perspiration}} rolled down his cheek-bone and anchored itself stickily on the angle <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw.</b> It tickled abominably, {{but he did}} not dare to move for fear of unleashing the scream which brooded over the situation like a cloud.|$|E
6000|$|And I {{heard the}} snap <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw,</b> {{and saw his}} eyes fixed {{fiercely}} on some imaginary object. I changed the subject hurriedly, and soon took my departure. But going down the steps, an old jingle came into my head, and has hardly left it since: ...|$|E
60|$|The Count of Markbrunnen was a sullen-looking personage, with lips {{protruding}} {{nearly three}} inches beyond his nose. From each side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> upper <b>jaw</b> projected a large tooth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Got {{away from}} me?" [...] John repeated, {{in a tone}} of utter disgust. [...] "He warn't such a sweet-looking object, or sweet-tempered 'un either, that I wur over-anxious for the {{pleasure}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> company, he warn't! I just got my hand out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaws</b> and let him go as fast as he liked, with a jolly good kick behind to help him on, too. You see, sir, I didn't know as you'd anything to do with putting him in there," [...] the man added apologetically. [...] "I thought he'd got in quite promiscuous-like." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he starts}} hauling and mauling {{and talking to}} him in Irish and the old towser {{growling}}, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has {{nothing better to do}} ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaws.</b>|$|R
6000|$|BEL AFFRIS. Doubled my {{fist and}} smote my Roman on the {{sharpness}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw.</b> He was but mortal after all: {{he lay down}} in a stupor; and I took his sword and laid it on. (Drawing the sword) Lo! a Roman sword with Roman blood on it! ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} there was tense silence, then Thurid, with a roar of rage sprang for my throat; just as Xodar had upon {{the deck of the}} cruiser. The results were identical. I ducked beneath his outstretched arms, and as he lunged past me planted a terrific right on the side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{sounded like}} a threat. His voice was determined, his eyes were flashing, the lines of his face had grown harsh. And to her {{it seemed that the}} angle <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw</b> had changed; its pitch had become unpleasantly aggressive. At the same time a wave of intense {{virility}} seemed to surge out from him and impinge upon her.|$|E
60|$|This was in {{the days}} before the Headmasters' Conference had {{abolished}} the knock-out blow, and a boxer might still pay attentions to the point <b>of</b> <b>his</b> opponent's <b>jaw</b> with an easy conscience.|$|R
60|$|After a {{while he}} began to make tours of {{discovery}} in the house. He would suddenly appear on the minister's writing-table when he was composing his Sunday sermon, and sit cocking his little pert head at him, seeming to wonder what he was about. But in all his explorations he proved himself a true Yankee squirrel, having always a shrewd eye on the main chance. If the parson dropped a nut on the floor, down went Whiskey after it, and into his provision-bag it went, {{and then he would}} look up as if he expected another; for he had a wallet on each side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaws,</b> and he always wanted both sides handsomely filled before he made for his hole. So busy and active and always intent on this one object was he, that before long the little lady found he had made way with six pounds <b>of</b> hazel-nuts. <b>His</b> general rule was to carry off four nuts at a time--three being stuffed into the side-pockets <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaws,</b> and the fourth held in his teeth. When he had furnished himself in this way, he would dart like lightning for his hole, and disappear in a moment; but in a short time up he would come, brisk and wide-awake, and ready for the next supply.|$|R
60|$|I {{am afraid}} {{not much of}} a chance. With one grip <b>of</b> <b>his</b> iron fingers and a pull, he could have plucked a muscle, say a biceps, by the roots, clear out of their bodies. A back-handed, loose blow <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fist could have smashed their skulls like egg-shells. With a sweep <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wicked feet (or hind-hands) he could have disembowelled them. A twist could have broken their necks, and I know that with a single crunch <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaws</b> he could have pierced, at the same moment, the great vein of the throat in front and the spinal marrow at the back.|$|R
60|$|The miner {{took this}} simple {{statement}} as a challenging question. His excitement visibly increased, {{but he did}} not at once reply. He talked on aimlessly, incoherently, struggling like a small animal in a torrent. He rose at last, and as he stood in the doorway, breathing deeply, his face livid in the sunset light, the muscles <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw</b> trembled.|$|E
60|$|But Undy Scott {{was not a}} man to be thus roughly {{handled with}} impunity; and in {{completing}} the education which he had received, the use of his fists had not been overlooked. He let out with his right hand, and struck Alaric twice with considerable force on the side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw,</b> so that the teeth rattled in his mouth.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{was upon}} me, {{reaching}} for my throat, and precisely as I {{had done that}} day in the courtyard of the Temple of Issus I did here in the garden of the palace of Salensus Oll. I ducked beneath his outstretched arms, and as he lunged past me I planted a terrific right upon the side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaw.</b>|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{he opened a}} small box {{containing}} a brown sort of dust, of which he put {{as much as he}} possibly could between the teeth <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lower <b>jaw</b> and the lip.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pull, oh, pull!' said Lalun at the last. A pair {{of brown}} hands grasped the window-sill and a venerable Muhammadan tumbled upon the floor, very much out <b>of</b> breath. <b>His</b> <b>jaws</b> were tied up, his turban had fallen over one eye, {{and he was}} dusty and angry.|$|R
5000|$|A single dancer, or , {{carries the}} heavy lion mask by his teeth. He is {{credited}} with supernatural abilities and strength. The [...] may also carry an adolescent boy or girl on its head. When carrying an adolescent boy or girl on his head, the Reog dancer holds weight of up to 100 kilograms in total. Holding the heavy big mask by biting, the warok relies on the strength <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jaws,</b> neck and shoulder muscles. The great mask spans over 2.5 meters with genuine tiger skin and real peacock feathers. It has gained international recognition as the world's largest mask.|$|R
