5|$|In Chagas-endemic areas, {{the main}} mode of {{transmission}} is through an insect vector called a triatomine bug. A triatomine becomes infected with T. cruzi by feeding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> of an infected person or animal. During the day, triatomines hide in crevices in the walls and roofs.|$|E
5|$|TPP is {{distinguished}} from {{other forms of}} periodic paralysis (especially hypokalemic periodic paralysis) with thyroid function tests <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood.</b> These are normal in the other forms, and in thyrotoxicosis the levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine are elevated, with resultant suppression of TSH production by the pituitary gland. Various other investigations are usually performed to separate the different causes of hyperthyroidism.|$|E
5|$|Ticks {{are small}} arachnids, {{part of the}} order Parasitiformes. Along with mites, they {{constitute}} the subclass Acari. Ticks are ectoparasites (external parasites), living by feeding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> of mammals, birds, and sometimes reptiles and amphibians. Ticks had evolved by the Cretaceous period, {{the most common form}} of fossilisation being immersed in amber. Ticks are widely distributed around the world, especially in warm, humid climates.|$|E

5|$|Vampire bats hunt {{only when}} it is fully dark. Like fruit-eating bats, and unlike insectivorous and {{fish-eating}} bats, they emit only low-energy sound pulses. The common vampire bat feeds mostly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> of mammals (occasionally including humans), whereas both the hairy-legged vampire bat and white-winged vampire bat feed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> of birds. Once the common vampire bat locates a host, such as a sleeping mammal, it lands and approaches it on the ground. It then likely uses thermoception to identify a warm spot on the skin to bite. They then create a small incision with their teeth and lap up blood from the wound.|$|E
5|$|In {{further studies}} {{conducted}} by Dr. Norman K. Hollenberg, {{professor of medicine}} at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School found that flavonols may also help vessels dilate and help keep platelets from clustering <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> vessel walls. Flavonoids found in hot chocolate are beneficial to health mainly because they shield the walls of blood vessels from free radical damage. Flavanols are also thought to help reduce blood platelet buildup and can balance levels of compounds called eicosanoids, which may be beneficial to cardiovascular health.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. Risk factors for toxicity include alcoholism, malnutrition, and the taking of certain other medications. Liver damage results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI decreases the liver's glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver. Diagnosis is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken. These values are often plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine level of concern.|$|E

5|$|Rh factor, {{also known}} as Rh D antigen, is an antigen found on red blood cells; {{individuals}} that are Rh-positive (Rh+) have this antigen on their red blood cells and individuals that are Rh-negative (Rh–) do not. During normal childbirth, delivery trauma or complications during pregnancy, blood from a fetus can enter the mother's system. In {{the case of an}} Rh-incompatible mother and child, consequential blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> cells of the Rh+ child, putting the remainder of the pregnancy, and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn.|$|E
5|$|The team {{is called}} {{to the home of}} a man whose heart was removed through a {{makeshift}} operation. They learn that not only did someone call for emergency help shortly after the heart's removal, but the man was found alive by the emergency response team well after his heart was removed, though he eventually died by the time Fringe arrived. Walter (John Noble) and Peter recognize scars <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> vessels leading to the heart, identifying the victim as one that received a heart transplant. During the autopsy at the lab, Walter concludes that a serum was used to prolong the victim's life well after the heart's removal, a chemical based on his own past research into life restoration.|$|E
5|$|Trinity Blood is an anime {{series of}} twenty-four episodes {{produced}} by Gonzo {{based on a}} series of light novels of the same name by Sunao Yoshida.

In a post-apocalyptic future, the series' main character, Abel Nightroad, a vampire feeding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> of other vampires, protects humanity in service of the Vatican. The series premiered on the Japanese satellite network WOWOW from April 28 through October 6, 2005 and was first released on DVD from August 26, 2005 through July 28, 2006.|$|E
