40|$|In {{this paper}} we address {{questions}} of 'shopping as practised' {{and its relation to}} shopping space. We argue that modes <b>of</b> <b>shopping,</b> which comprise distinctive sets <b>of</b> <b>shopping</b> practices involving relations to goods (purchases), relations of looking (and seeing), the place <b>of</b> <b>shopping</b> in the rhythms of everyday life, and the socialities <b>of</b> <b>shopping,</b> are used to invest meaning in particular types <b>of</b> <b>shopping</b> space and to produce individual, accumulated, personalised shopping geographies that weave together particular locations and generic spaces. Furthermore, modes <b>of</b> <b>shopping</b> are shown to require specific sets of knowledge to practise and to relate to specific subject positions, namely necessity and choice. These arguments are developed in relation to charity shops and charity shopping. However, they are shown to have broader implications: specifically they show the relationality <b>of</b> modes <b>of</b> <b>shopping</b> and shopping spaces, and the distinctions between shopping geographies and retail geographies. Theoretically, they suggest that accounts <b>of</b> <b>shopping</b> need to locate meaning in practice; that the meanings <b>of</b> <b>shopping</b> (and the meanings invested in particular shopping spaces) are therefore potentially unstable; and that accounts of the constituting subjects <b>of</b> <b>shopping</b> need to take seriously the spatialities of subjectivities...|$|R
