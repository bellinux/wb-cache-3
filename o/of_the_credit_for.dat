5|$|Necrid's design {{targeted}} North American audiences, specifically fans of American comic books. Although McFarlane received most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the character, Necrid was {{the result}} of a collaboration; Namco outlined the then-unnamed character's traits, such as his in-game role and physical build, and McFarlane's company completed the design. As a result, both companies hold a partial copyright for Necrid, with Namco's rights to the character as a derivative work of McFarlane's illustrations.|$|E
5|$|Although only an {{alternate}} {{member of the}} tribunal without a vote, his voice was heard {{in all of its}} deliberations, his hand drafted a large and most important part of its judgment, and no one connected with the tribunal, member or otherwise, had a greater part than he in shaping the final result. If, as I confidently believe, the work of the tribunal will constitute a landmark in the development of world order based on law, to Norman Birkett must go a large share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the success of the undertaking. To few men does the opportunity come to labour so mightily for the welfare of their kind.|$|E
5|$|From 1961 to 1967, he was {{a leading}} member of a strong Scottish {{international}} team that lost only once to England, in 1965, shortly after he recovered from the leg fracture. He thought his best international performance was a 2–1 win against England in 1963, when he scored both goals after Scotland were reduced to 10 players. In the 1967 match against England, who had won the 1966 World Cup, he taunted the opposition by ball juggling while waiting for his teammates to find good positions. Although he was given most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the 3–2 win, some commentators wished he had {{made an effort to}} run up a bigger score.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{scientific literature}} {{has revealed that}} <b>the</b> problematics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> borrowing market in respect <b>of</b> issuance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credits</b> <b>for</b> physical entities still lack <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scientific attention. <b>The</b> research <b>of</b> this type {{was considered to be}} purposeful since crediting of physical entities generates a significant share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revenue <b>for</b> <b>credit</b> institutions. <b>The</b> main purpose <b>of</b> this paper is to research the problematic and trends of Lithuanian borrowing market in respect <b>of</b> issuance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credits</b> <b>for</b> physical entities. <b>The</b> methodology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research includes analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scientific literature and analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statistical data. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research have revealed that Lithuanian borrowing market has recovered after the economic/financial crisis, which is confirmed by the gradual increase in <b>the</b> volumes <b>of</b> different kinds of <b>credits</b> issued <b>for</b> physical entities as well as by <b>the</b> increased turnover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> cards market...|$|R
5|$|Kagan {{believes}} that while Alcibiades was a commander of considerable ability, {{he was no}} military genius, and his confidence and ambitions went far beyond his skills. He thus was capable of important errors and serious miscalculations. Kagan argues that at Notium, Alcibiades committed a serious error in leaving the fleet {{in the hands of}} an inexperienced officer, and that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the brilliant victory at Cyzicus must be assigned to Thrasybulus. In this judgement, Kagan agrees with Cornelius Nepos, who said that the Athenians' extravagant opinion of Alcibiades's abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.|$|E
5|$|Officers from Latona {{were first}} {{to board the}} French frigate but Emeric refused to tender his formal {{surrender}} except to an officer of Horatio because he insisted that Horatio had caused the entirety of Junons damage. British historians have debated this opinion: William James agreed with this assessment, but also opined that if Horatio had been alone {{it would have been}} Scott surrendering rather than the French officers, such was the damage his ship had suffered in the battle. Edward Pelham Brenton, who was a serving officer in the Caribbean at the time, gives most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the victory to Latona, in a detailed account that James later criticised for its inaccuracies.|$|E
5|$|One of Grant's actions {{during the}} siege was to settle a {{lingering}} rivalry. On May 30, General McClernand wrote a self-adulatory note to his troops, claiming much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the soon-to-be victory. Grant had been waiting six months for him to slip, ever since they clashed early in the campaign, around the Battle of Arkansas Post. He had received permission to relieve McClernand in January 1863 but waited for an unequivocal provocation. Grant finally relieved McClernand on June 18. He so diligently prepared his action that McClernand was left without recourse. McClernand's XIII Corps {{was turned over to}} Maj. Gen. Edward Ord, recovered from a wound sustained at Hatchie's Bridge. In May 1864, McClernand was restored to a command in remote Texas.|$|E

5|$|Reagan's {{campaign}} {{relied on}} a strategy crafted by campaign manager John Sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of Ford's likely nomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois. The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan, when he swept all 96 delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> that victory came {{from the work of}} three co-chairmen, including Ernest Angelo, the mayor of Midland, and Ray Barnhart of Houston, whom Reagan as President would appoint in 1981 as director of the Federal Highway Administration.|$|E
5|$|The fledgling RAAF faced several {{challenges}} to its continued {{existence in the}} 1920s and early 1930s, and Williams received much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> maintaining its independence. However an adverse report on flying safety standards saw him dismissed from the position of CAS and seconded to the RAF prior to World WarII. Despite support in various quarters for his reinstatement as Air Force chief, and promotion to air marshal in 1940, he never again commanded the RAAF. After the war he was forcibly retired along with other World War I veteran officers. He took up the position of Director-General of Civil Aviation in Australia, and was knighted the year before his retirement in 1955.|$|E
5|$|On 29 November, after a night's chase, the British caught {{their opponents}} near Pelagosa. The French force {{consisted}} of the large frigates Pauline and Pomone, and the armed storeship Persanne. In the battle that followed, Unite pursued and, after a lengthy chase, seized the smaller Persanne, while Maxwell and James Alexander Gordon in Active engaged the frigates. The action was bitterly contested, the British taking 61 casualties, including Gordon who lost a leg. However, Alceste and Active successfully isolated Pomone, and when another British ship, , appeared in the distance, Pauline fled. Alone and having lost heavily, Pomone surrendered. The prizes were later sold along with their cargo of 200 cannon. Maxwell, despite attributing most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the victory to the wounded Gordon, was rewarded in 1812 with command of , a former Italian frigate captured at the Battle of Lissa.|$|E

On 6 April 1872, Cruikshank submitted {{a letter to}} The Times, claiming that he was upset about his name being left out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credits</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> play. Additionally, he claimed that {{the idea for the}} novel came from himself and not from Ainsworth. This provoked a controversy between the two.|$|R
5|$|On the Coalition side, Mack {{was given}} much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> Coburg's triumph. Blamed for the defeat, Miranda {{traveled}} to Paris to intrigue against Dumouriez. The Austro-Dutch reported losses of 97 officers, 2,762 {{rank and file}} and 779 horses. The French lost 4,000 killed and wounded, plus 1,000 men and 30 artillery pieces captured. General of Brigade Georges Guiscard de Bar was killed and four generals were wounded. Another source estimated Austrian losses as 2,600 killed and wounded and 400 missing while French casualties were 3,000 killed and wounded plus 1,000 missing or prisoners. Immediately after the battle, about 6,000 French volunteers deserted the colors and went home. Three days later, Dumouriez's army only numbered about 20,000 troops as the men deserted in hundreds. On 23 March there was a clash at Pellenberg where Coburg with 38,000 soldiers defeated Dumouriez with 22,000. The Austrians sustained 900 casualties while inflicting 2,000 on the French.|$|E
5|$|The King's Mountain victors {{and their}} prisoners {{returned}} to McDowell's estate, early on, the morning of, October 10, 1780. From there, the various commanders and their men went their separate ways. Shelby {{and his men}} joined General Daniel Morgan at New Providence, South Carolina. While there, Shelby advised Morgan to take Fort Ninety-Six and Augusta, because he believed the British forces, there were supplying the Cherokee with weapons, for their raids, against colonial settlers. Morgan agreed to the plan, as did General Horatio Gates, the supreme commander of colonial forces in the region. Assured that his plan would be carried out, Shelby returned home and promised to return the following spring with 300 men. On his way to Fort Ninety-Six, Morgan was attacked by Banastre Tarleton and gained a decisive victory over him at the Battle of Cowpens. Shelby later lamented the fact, that General Nathanael Greene, who relieved Gates only days after Shelby departed for home, claimed the lion's share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> Cowpens when it was Shelby's plan that had put Morgan {{in the position to}} begin with.|$|E
