5|$|Males {{are easy}} to {{identify}} due to their perceptibly broad and smaller mandibles. Their antennae consist of 13 segments, and are almost the same length as the ants' bodies. Ergatandromorph (an ant that exhibits both male and worker characteristics) males are known; in 1985, a male M. gulosa was collected before it hatched from its cocoon, {{and it had a}} long but excessively curved left mandible while the other mandible was small. On the right side of its body, it was structurally male, but the left side appeared female. The head was also longer on the female side, its colour was darker, and the legs and prothorax were smaller on the male side. Male genitalia are retracted into a genital cavity that is located in the posterior end of the gaster. The sperm is structurally the same to other animal sperm, forming an <b>oval</b> <b>head</b> with a long tail.|$|E
500|$|The Borg Queen was a {{challenge}} because {{she had to be}} unique among Borg but still retain human qualities; Westmore was conscious of avoiding comparisons to films like Alien. The final appearance involved pale gray skin and an elongated, <b>oval</b> <b>head,</b> with coils of wire rather than hair. Krige recalled the first day she had her makeup applied: [...] "I saw everyone cringing. I thought, great; they made this, and they've scared themselves!" [...] Frakes noted that the Queen ended up being alluring in a disturbing way, despite her evil behavior and appearance. Zimmerman, Everton and Westmore combined their efforts to design and create the Borgified sections of the Enterprise to build tension and to make the audience feel that [...] " [...] the Borg".|$|E
500|$|The overall {{body of the}} ant {{is poorly}} {{preserved}} {{and much of it}} is indistinct. Macabeemyrma ovata is about [...] long with a distinct elongated <b>oval</b> <b>head</b> capsule that is about 1.5x longer than wide. The holotype is missing the wings and some portions of the legs while the eyes are very faintly preserved. It could not be confirmed whether its eyes were compound or not, but if it was to be confirmed they would share similar eye characteristics to Myrmecia. The exact shape of the mandibles cannot be properly determined, but they are elongated and not subtriangular which is normal for other members of Myrmeciinae except the genus Myrmecia. Its elongated head and mandibles distinguish this species from those in the genus Ypresiomyrma, which are otherwise thought to have a close phylogenetic relationship due to similarities. [...] The waist consists of a single segment, and whether or not the ant has a sting cannot be fully determined due to the condition of the specimen collected.|$|E

60|$|One of {{his last}} friendships was with Rusper, the ironmonger. Rusper took over Worthington's shop about three years after Mr. Polly opened. He was a tall, lean, nervous, convulsive man with an upturned, back-thrown, <b>oval</b> <b>head,</b> who read {{newspapers}} and the Review of Reviews assiduously, had belonged to a Literary Society somewhere once, and had some defect of the palate that at first gave his lightest word a charm and interest for Mr. Polly. It caused a peculiar clicking sound, {{as though he had}} something between a giggle and a gas-meter at work in his neck.|$|E

He watched her covertly, with {{tingling}} pulses, as she devoted herself to her neighbour--the Lord-Lieutenant of the county. He considered himself a judge of the sex, but he had had few opportunities even of admiring such women as the mistress of Thorpe. He watched {{the curve of her}} white neck with its delicate, satin-like skin, the play of her features, the poise of her somewhat small, <b>oval</b> <b>head.</b> He admired the slightly wearied air with which she performed her duties and accepted the compliments of her neighbour. [...] "A woman of mysteries" [...] some one had once called her, and he realized that it was the mouth and the dark, tired eyes which puzzled those who attempted to classify her. What a triumph--to bring her down to the world of ordinary women, to drive the weariness away, to feel the soft touch, perhaps, of those wonderful arms! He was a young man of many conquests, and with a sufficiently good idea of himself. The thought was like wine in his blood. If only it were possible! ...|$|E
