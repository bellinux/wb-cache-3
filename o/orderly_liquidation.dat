40|$|Session 6 : Special {{focus on}} Asian Insolvency Law'In our modern era of globalisation, failing or failed {{companies}} disrupt {{international trade and}} commerce unless cross-border insolvency (CBI) laws enable their <b>orderly</b> restructuring or <b>liquidation</b> across multiple jurisdictions. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008 is the quintessential CBI: the US investment bank’s bankruptcy resulted in 75 separate legal proceedings in nine countries concerning US$ 639 billion in assets, US$ 619 billion in debt and 25, 000 employees worldwide. CBI concerns a failing or failed debtor company whose creditors, assets and/or place of incorporation are located in different jurisdictions. Therefore, restructuring or liquidation of the debtor company occurs in multiple jurisdictions, and judicial decisions made in one jurisdiction may not be recognised or enforced in another. Before China assumed sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, China regarded Hong Kong as a foreign jurisdiction and, as such, judicial recognition between them was sought through international conventions. However, after the handover, international conventions {{could no longer be}} applied because under international law 'an international convention may only be applied among states as independent subjects of the international community, but not directly to any part of a country without transplantation'. (Zhu, 2009) Hong Kong-China CBI thus belonged to neither international nor ‘traditional’ domestic laws. This legal lacuna poses challenges to Hong Kong and Chinese courts in granting judicial recognition to assist in restructuring or liquidation and ensuring justice is done in resolving CBI disputes. The existing legal framework for judicial recognition lies with the Agreement of Mutual Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters between Mainland China and Hong Kong SAR (the 2006 Agreement). However, as suggested by its name, the agreement applies only to civil and commercial matters and does not cover CBI matters. This unsettled CBI issue must be resolved, given Hong Kong’s status as a global financial centre and China’s as the world’s second largest economy, because their courts are asked frequently to adjudicate on CBI disputes even though neither jurisdiction has adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency which establishes international CBI standards. I, the presenter, will examine methods to fill the legal lacuna and resolve the unsettled CBI issue: specifically, whether an extension of the 2006 Agreement could cover Hong Kong-China CBI cases; whether a treaty or bilateral agreement that focuses on mutual judicial recognition of CBI judgments will be signed; or whether Hong Kong and Chinese courts would sign Memorandums of Understanding for CBI judicial recognition. ...|$|R
40|$|While {{hedge funds}} have been around {{at least since the}} 1940 's, it has only been in {{the last decade or so}} that they have {{attracted}} the widespread attention of investors, academics and regulators. Investors, mainly wealthy individuals but also increasingly institutional investors, are attracted to hedge funds because they promise high “absolute” returns [...] high returns even when returns on mainstream asset classes like stocks and bonds are low or negative. This prospect, not surprisingly, has increased interest in hedge funds in recent years as returns on stocks have plummeted around the world, and as investors have sought alternative investment strategies to insulate them in the future from the kind of bear markets we are now experiencing. Government regulators, too, have become increasingly attentive to hedge funds, especially since the notorious collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in September 1998. Over the course of only a few months during the summer of 1998 LTCM lost billions of dollars because of failed investment strategies that were not well understood even by its own investors, let alone by its bankers and derivatives counterparties. LTCM had built up huge leverage both on and off the balance sheet, so that when its investments soured it was unable to meet the demands of creditors and derivatives counterparties. Had LTCM’s counterparties terminated and liquidated their positions with LTCM, the result could have been a severe liquidity shortage and sharp changes in asset prices, which many feared could have impaired the solvency of other financial institutions and destabilized financial markets generally. The Federal Reserve did not wait to see if this would happen. It intervened to organize an immediate (September 1998) creditor-bailout by LTCM’s largest creditors and derivatives counterparties, preventing the wholesale liquidation of LTCM’s positions. Over the course of the year that followed the bailout, the creditor committee charged with managing LTCM’s positions effected an <b>orderly</b> work-out and <b>liquidation</b> of LTCM’s positions. We will never know what would have happened had the Federal Reserve not intervened. In defending the Federal Reserve’s unusual actions in coming to the assistance of an unregulated financial institutions like a hedge fund, William McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, stated that it was the Federal Reserve’s judgement that the “ [...] . abrupt and disorderly close-out of LTCM’s positions would pose unacceptable risks to the American economy. [...] . there was a likelihood that a number of credit and interest rate markets would experience extreme price moves and possibly cease to function for a period of one or more days and maybe longer. This would have caused a vicious cycle: a loss of investor confidence, lending to further liquidations of positions, and so on. ” The near-collapse of LTCM galvanized regulators throughout the world to examine the operations of hedge funds to determine if they posed a risk to investors and to financial stability more generally. Studies were undertaken by nearly every major central bank, regulatory agency, and international “regulatory” committee (such as the Basle Committee and IOSCO), and reports were issued, by among others, The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, the United States General Accounting Office (GAO), the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group, the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). Many of these studies concluded that there was a need for greater disclosure by hedge funds in order to increase transparency and enhance market discipline, by creditors, derivatives counterparties and investors. In the Fall of 1999 two bills were introduced before the U. S. Congress directed at increasing hedge fund disclosure (the “Hedge Fund Disclosure Act” [the “Baker Bill”] and the “Markey/Dorgan Bill”). But when the legislative firestorm sparked by the LTCM’s episode finally quieted, there was no new regulation of hedge funds. This paper provides an overview of the regulation of hedge funds and examines the key regulatory issues that now confront regulators throughout the world. In particular, two major issues are examined. First, whether hedge funds pose a systemic threat to the stability of financial markets, and, if so, whether additional government regulation would be useful. And second, whether existing regulation provides sufficient protection for hedge fund investors, and, if not, what additional regulation is needed...|$|R

2500|$|Risky {{practices}} {{among the}} major financial institutions on Wall Street were widely seen as contributing to the subprime mortgage crisis, the financial crisis of 2007–08, and the subsequent Great Recession, so Obama made Wall Street reform a priority in his first term. On July 21, 2010, Obama signed the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the largest financial regulatory overhaul since the New Deal. The act increased regulation and reporting requirements on derivatives (particularly credit default swaps), and took steps to limit systemic risks to the US economy with policies such as higher capital requirements, {{the creation of the}} <b>Orderly</b> <b>Liquidation</b> Authority to help wind down large, failing financial institutions, and the creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to monitor systemic risks. Dodd-Frank also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was charged with protecting consumers against abusive financial practices. On signing the bill, Obama stated that the bill would [...] "empower consumers and investors," [...] "bring the shadowy deals that caused the crisis to the light of day," [...] and [...] "put a stop to taxpayer bailouts once and for all." [...] Some liberals were disappointed that the law did not break up the country's largest banks or reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act, while many conservatives criticized the bill as a government overreach that could make the country less competitive. Under the bill, the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies were required to propose and implement several new regulatory rules, and battles over these rules continued throughout Obama's presidency. Obama called for further Wall Street reform after the passage of Dodd-Frank, saying that banks should have a smaller role in the economy and less incentive to make risky trades. Obama also signed the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which created new rules for credit card companies.|$|E

5000|$|The third-most common {{method of}} {{estimating}} {{the value of a}} company looks to the assets and liabilities of the business.
