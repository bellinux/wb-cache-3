5|$|Although most justices were {{immediately}} convinced, Warren {{spent some time}} after this famous speech convincing everyone to sign onto the opinion. Justices Jackson and Reed finally decided to drop their dissent. The final decision was unanimous. Warren drafted the basic opinion and kept circulating and revising it until he had an opinion endorsed by {{all the members of}} the Court. Reed was the last holdout and reportedly cried during the reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion, which held that §8772 does not infringe on {{the separation of}} powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government, considering also that the law is an exercise of congressional authority regarding foreign affairs. Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Samuel Alito, and Justice Elena Kagan joined the majority opinion (however, Justice Thomas did not join as to Part II-C <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion).</b>|$|E

5|$|Modern sources citing Plummer and Bad Elk {{have tended}} {{to discuss the issue}} as defense against {{unlawful}} force; under contemporary law in most jurisdictions, a person may not use force to resist an unlawful arrest.

5|$|The {{church has}} not been {{conclusively}} dated.

5|$|The time of {{the present}} church's {{construction}} cannot be exactly defined.

One author has placed its construction in the late 13th or early 14th century and others include the 11th century among the possibilities.|$|E
5|$|The use of crests {{was once}} {{restricted}} {{to those of}} 'tournament rank', i.e. knights and above, but in modern times nearly all personal arms include crests. They are not generally used by women (with the exception of reigning queens) and clergymen, as they {{did not participate in}} war or tournaments and thus would not have helms on which to wear them. Some heraldists are also <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> that crests, as personal devices, are not suited for use by corporate bodies, but this is not widely observed.|$|E

5|$|A {{city can}} be created from a town by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 39 of The Cities Act {{if it has a}} {{population}} of 5,000 or more and the change in status is requested by the town council. A city does not automatically revert to town status if the population drops below 5,000; this only occurs if the city council requests it, the majority of electors vote to revert to town status, or the minister is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> that the reversion to town status is in the public interest. Melville retains its city status despite dropping below the 5,000 population threshold in the 1990s.|$|E

For 15 years ANA had operated in the knowledge that the only satisfactory time to check fuel tanks for the presence of water was prior to the first flight of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight. Throughout this time ANA checked fuel tanks for the presence of water prior to the first flight of the day.|$|E

5000|$|The Court remanded {{the case}} to the Circuit court to {{determine}} whether Wheaton had satisfied the requirements for copyright protection.

[...] Thus, any copyright protection for published judicial opinions could cover ancillary materials such as summaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinions</b> and commentaries on them, but not the judicially authored texts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinions</b> themselves.|$|R
5|$|After {{the first}} two shows of season two, Jim Shelley in The Guardian, called The Wire the best show on TV, praising the second season {{for its ability to}} detach from its former {{foundations}} in the first season. Jon Garelick with the Boston Phoenix was <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> that the subculture of the docks (second season) was not as absorbing as that of the housing projects (first season), but he went on to praise the writers for creating a realistic world and populating it with an array of interesting characters.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitism {{was common}} in Germany and {{throughout}} Europe during this period, and Manstein's {{attitude towards the}} Jews had its roots in his exposure to and assimilation of these views. His actions were a reflection of his loyalty toward Hitler and the Nazi regime and of his grounding {{in a sense of}} duty based on traditional Prussian military values. His criticism of Hitler was based solely on their disagreements over the conduct of the war, not about the regime's racial policies. Some historians, including Antony Beevor and Benoît Lemay, are <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> that Manstein had some Jewish ancestry. Manstein was the only Reichswehr officer who opposed the introduction of the Aryan paragraph in 1934. He sent a letter of protest to General Beck, commenting that anyone who had volunteered to serve in the armed forces had already proven their worth.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} campaign, Isbul and Malamir {{captured}} the Thracian fortresses of Probaton (near Adrianople, modern Edirne) and Bourdizon (modern Babaeski). After conquering these two fortresses, the Bulgarian troops reached Philippopolis (now Plovdiv). As the defence forces of the city had fled, Isbul and Malamir entered negotiations with the population in order to persuade them to cede the fortress. Pavlov is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> that the war ended with {{a continuation of the}} peace of 815. He believes that Byzantine Emperor Theophilos (r. 829–842) was forced to make concessions to Bulgaria, which may have included the incorporation of Philippopolis and its close surroundings into the Bulgarian Empire.|$|E

5|$|Early fossil {{remains were}} fragmentary, {{which led to}} much {{speculation}} on the posture and nature of Iguanodon. Iguanodon was initially portrayed as a quadrupedal horn-nosed beast. However, as more bones were discovered, Mantell observed that the forelimbs were {{much smaller than the}} hindlimbs. His rival Owen was <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> it was a stumpy creature with four pillar-like legs. The job of overseeing the first lifesize reconstruction of dinosaurs was initially offered to Mantell, who declined due to poor health, and Owen's vision subsequently formed the basis on which the sculptures took shape. Its bipedal nature was revealed with the discovery of the Bernissart skeletons. However, it was depicted in an upright posture, with the tail dragging along the ground, acting as the third leg of a tripod.|$|E
5|$|Einsatzgruppe B, C, and D did not {{immediately}} follow Einsatzgruppe A's example in systematically killing all Jews in their areas. The Einsatzgruppe commanders, {{with the exception of}} Einsatzgruppe A's Stahlecker, were <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> by the fall of 1941 {{that it was impossible to}} kill the entire Jewish population of the Soviet Union in one sweep, and thought the killings should stop. An Einsatzgruppe report dated 17 September advised that the Germans would be better off using any skilled Jews as labourers rather than shooting them. Also, in some areas poor weather and a lack of transportation led to a slowdown in deportations of Jews from points further west. Thus, an interval passed between the first round of Einsatzgruppen massacres in summer and fall, and what American historian Raul Hilberg called the second sweep, which started in December 1941 and lasted into the summer of 1942. During the interval, the surviving Jews were forced into ghettos.|$|E
5|$|From 1980 on, {{a better}} {{understanding}} of dinosaur biomechanics, and studies by palaeontologists Andreas Christian and Holger Preuschoft on the resistance to bending of the back of Plateosaurus, led to widespread acceptance of an erect, digitigrade limb posture and a roughly horizontal position of the back. Many researchers were <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> that Plateosaurus could use both quadrupedal gaits (for slow speeds) and bipedal gaits (for rapid locomotion), and Wellnhofer insisted that the tail curved strongly downward, making a bipedal posture impossible. However, Moser showed that the tail was in fact straight.|$|E
