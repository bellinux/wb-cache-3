"Latinoamérica" [...] is {{a celebration}} of Latin America and its culture {{as well as a}} {{statement}} against United States intervention in the region; in the song, Residente vows that he will [...] "never forget" [...] Operation Condor. [...] "La Bala" [...] illustrates the pathway of a bullet as a means to denounce violence. According to Visitante, [...] "Prepárame la Cena" [...] is about [...] "being imprisoned", adding, [...] "Sometimes you can be imprisoned and still be outside." [...] "Baile De Los Pobres" [...] {{has been described as a}} [...] "lust song" [...] with subject matter comparable to Billy Joel's [...] "working-class desires" [...] in his 1983 song [...] "Uptown Girl". Residente's [...] "gentler side" [...] is displayed on [...] "La Vuelta al Mundo", where he describes a trip around the world to escape the monotonous nature of working in an <b>office</b> <b>cubicle.</b>|$|E
2500|$|These {{are live}} action shorts {{in which the}} regular {{characters}} are depicted by puppets. These may be skits, or musical performances with They Might Be Giants. Many Puppet Stuff videos feature the characters interacting with children, often related to The Brothers Chaps. One spin-off series, [...] "Biz Cas Fri", depicts Homestar and Strong Bad's interactions from his <b>office</b> <b>cubicle</b> at work. The first Biz Cas Fri video arguably first coined the term Doge.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>office</b> <b>cubicle</b> {{was created}} by {{designer}} Robert Propst for Herman Miller, and released in 1967 under the name [...] "Action Office II". Although cubicles are often seen as being symbolic of work in a modern office setting due to their uniformity and blandness, they afford the employee {{a greater degree of}} privacy and personalization than in previous work environments, which often consisted of desks lined up in rows within an open room. In some <b>office</b> <b>cubicle</b> workspaces, employees can decorate the walls of their cubicle with posters, pictures and other items.|$|E
50|$|One Workplace is a {{commercial}} office furniture dealership in Northern California. It is headquartered in Santa Clara, California and has regional offices in Oakland, California and San Francisco, California. One Workplace sells <b>office</b> <b>cubicles,</b> chairs, desks, tables, movable walls, office accessories, storage cabinets, whiteboards, and audiovisual systems. It is a privately held company.|$|R
50|$|Privatized {{commercial}} rest {{areas may}} take a form of a truck stop complete with a filling station, arcade video games, and recreation center, shower facilities, and fast food restaurant, cafeteria, or food court all under one roof immediately adjacent to the freeway. Some even offer business services, such as ATMs, fax machines, <b>office</b> <b>cubicles,</b> and internet access.|$|R
50|$|Portable {{walls are}} not {{generally}} anchored to a floor or ceiling, unlike suspended accordion room dividers, and drapes, pipe and drape. They {{are different than}} traditional <b>office</b> <b>cubicles</b> in that portable walls often serve a temporary function rather than a permanent workspace, such as use for art exhibits, classrooms, triage areas, trade show display, and similar uses.|$|R

50|$|Some companies, {{particularly}} those where employees {{spend a great}} deal of time on the road and at remote locations, offer a hotdesking or hoteling arrangement where employees can reserve the use of a temporary traditional <b>office,</b> <b>cubicle</b> or meeting room at the company headquarters, a remote office center, or other shared office facility.|$|E
5000|$|Occupants of flophouses {{generally}} share bathroom {{facilities and}} reside in very tight quarters. People who {{make use of}} these places are often transients. Quarters in flophouses are typically very small, and may resemble <b>office</b> <b>cubicles</b> more than a regular room in a hotel or apartment building. Some flophouses qualify as boarding houses, {{but only if they}} offer meals.|$|R

500|$|Early skyscrapers {{were mainly}} {{made up of}} small <b>office</b> <b>cubicles,</b> {{commonly}} only [...] across, which were placed adjacent to one another along long corridors, following a pattern first invented in the Oriel Chambers building in England in 1864. This allowed the average small company to rent {{a small amount of}} space using one or two offices, but held out the option for future expansion by renting additional <b>office</b> <b>cubicles</b> if required at a later date. A skyscraper office relied on natural sunlight from the windows but if necessary was dimly lit from electric desk-top lamps. By the standards of the day, these offices were very modern, with radiators, air vents, and the latest fixtures and fittings, and modern communication systems, including telephone and pneumatic tubes were often installed. As a result, many businesses chose to move out of their older, low-rise offices in Chicago to take up tenancy in the new skyscrapers, which were felt to be more convenient and healthier.|$|R

50|$|From {{the front}} {{entrance}} lobby, the sales office opens to the left, the tasting area {{to the right and}} the front portion of the shed is directly ahead. An unlined, high volume space with fixed timber louvres along the upper north and south walls, the front portion of the shed is wider than the other parts of the shed and has a timber floor supported by timber posts from the cellar below. It accommodates barrel storage, a small open <b>office</b> <b>cubicle</b> and the excise inspector's office. The <b>office</b> <b>cubicle</b> sits on a timber platform projecting into the middle shed area where it is supported by timber stumps. The office accommodates narrow timber benches with cupboards below, a small table and a bench seat. A number of framed certificates and awards are propped around the office. A timber framed podium clad with vertical tongue and groove boards, the elevated excise inspector's office, stands to the north and is approached by a set of timber stairs. It projects into the middle shed area and commands views across the whole shed.|$|E
50|$|Systems {{furniture}} is a generic term for bundles of panels, worksurfaces, shelves, {{and other items}} sold by a single manufacturer as a package for furnishing <b>offices.</b> <b>Cubicles</b> and the sea of cubicles are the item most often compliant with systems furniture, but other open plan arrangements such as office landscape are plausible, but not feasible. This {{is due to the}} lack of base support from the material.|$|R
50|$|Cubicles in the 2010s {{are usually}} {{equipped}} with a computer, monitor, keyboard and mouse on the work surface. Cubicles typically have a desk phone. Since many offices use overhead fluorescent lights to illuminate the <b>office,</b> <b>cubicles</b> {{may or may not}} have lamps or other additional lighting. Other furniture that is often used in <b>cubicles</b> includes an <b>office</b> chair, a filing cabinet for locking documents away, a bookcase and a coatrack.|$|R

The Louisville headquarters featured a number of otherenvironmentally-friendly features including low-VOC paint, bamboo flooring and cabinetry, environmentally-friendly carpet and glue, recycled <b>office</b> <b>cubicles,</b> and an <b>office</b> recyclingprogram that included compost collection. Many Real Goods company parties were zero-waste events.|$|R

50|$|In many {{countries}} (such as Australia, France, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Denmark or the United States), a white-collar worker {{is a person}} who performs professional, managerial, or administrative work. White-collar work is performed in an <b>office,</b> <b>cubicle,</b> or other administrative setting. Other types of work are those of a blue-collar worker, whose job requires manual labor and a pink-collar worker, whose labor is related to customer interaction, entertainment, sales, or other service-oriented work. Many occupations blend blue, white and pink (service) industry categorizations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{office is}} a small, single-story, single-room office {{building}} (with the addition, after the historic period, of a small closet, with a sink and toilet, {{as well as an}} <b>office</b> <b>cubicle).</b> The exterior is painted a dark brownish-red, common on industrial buildings in the last century, and sometimes referred to as [...] "mineral" [...] red or [...] "iron" [...] red, with white trim. This was the color scheme of the office {{at the time of its}} move to Hyde Street Pier. The structure stands by itself at the pier, just as it did on the original site.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Real Goods — with Gaiam as its {{majority}} shareholder — moved into new corporate offices in Louisville, Colorado and went solar with a 100 kW solar system installed by Real Goods Solar that provides approximately 20 {{percent of the}} company’s energy requirements. In addition, the new headquarters feature low-VOC paints, bamboo flooring and cabinetry, earth-friendly carpet and glue, and recycled <b>office</b> <b>cubicles.</b> In 2008, Real Goods also added composting collection to its comprehensive office recycling program, and some company parties are now zero-waste events.|$|R
5000|$|Originally envisioned as two {{separate}} buildings, one for storing records {{and the other}} for workers, [...] Neutra and Alexander combined the buildings into one. The T-shaped building has odd number floors on the north side, with double high ceilings and tall windows. The records block on the south side, has floors at 8-ft intervals. Currently, no vital records accessible to the public are in the building, and the windowless south records block designed for storage has been converted to <b>office</b> <b>cubicles.</b> In 1991, the County Recorder's office moved to Norwalk following merging the office with the County Registrar and County Clerk by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.|$|R
25|$|Creation of a small, (15–30 mL/1–2 tbsp) thumb-sized pouch {{from the}} upper stomach, {{accompanied}} by bypass of the remaining stomach (about 400 mL and variable). This restricts the volume of food which can be eaten. The stomach may simply be partitioned (like a wall between two rooms in a house or two <b>office</b> <b>cubicles</b> {{next to each other}} with a partition wall in between them - and typically by the use of surgical staples), or it may be totally divided into two separate/separated parts (also with staples). Total division (separate/separated parts) is usually advocated to reduce the possibility that the two parts of the stomach will heal back together ("fistulize") and negate the operation.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{unlikely}} that any other office furnishings has had {{as much of a}} social impact as the introduction of the <b>office</b> <b>cubicle</b> in the 1960s, though the outcome of the cubicle's arrival is still open to debate, in both its pros and cons. Author Thomas Hine has {{gone so far as to}} speculate that the cubicle made it possible for women to move into middle management positions in the late 1960s because the introduction of cubicles gave their male counterparts a new office environment in which to place women managers without having to allow their entry into the private [...] "bull pens" [...] that had been the exclusive domain of men.|$|E
5000|$|On March 31, 2017, Netflix {{added a new}} {{featured}} Netflix Original titled Netflix Live. The show features 48 {{minutes of}} comedy actor Will Arnett providing commentary on [...] "live crosses" [...] to tediously mundane footage, mostly featuring office settings and appliances. The featured settings were a photocopier, microwave, toaster, two people thumb wrestling (who {{turned out to be}} Adam Sandler and Shannon Purser from Stranger Things), crossword puzzle, a refrigerator (from the inside with the door closed), pencil sharpener, <b>office</b> <b>cubicle,</b> a book of Shakespeare (being read), a driver parallel parking (poorly), nighttime, a puddle and grass.

50|$|The cellar is {{dug into}} the ground below the front part of the shed and is {{accessed}} from the middle barrel storage area {{by a set of}} concrete stairs descending below the excise officer's podium. A narrow corrugated iron sheeted chute incorporating a timber ladder drops into the cellar {{on the south side of}} the projecting front <b>office</b> <b>cubicle.</b> Rows of rough unsawn posts support timber beams carrying the framing for the floor above. Barrels rest on timber racks standing on the part concrete, part dirt floor. Perimeter retaining walls to the north and south are timber framed and lined with corrugated iron and those to the east and west are constructed of concrete and timber. A set of timber stairs to east side climbs to the tasting area above.|$|E
50|$|When the United States joined World War II, Vannevar Bush was {{president}} of the Carnegie Institution. Several months before, on June 12, 1940, Bush had been instrumental in persuading President Franklin Roosevelt to create the National Defense Research Committee (later superseded by the Office of Scientific Research and Development) to mobilize and coordinate the nation's scientific war effort. Bush quickly housed the new agency in the Carnegie Institution's administrative headquarters at 16th and P Streets, NW, in Washington, DC, converting its great rotunda and auditorium into <b>office</b> <b>cubicles.</b> From this location, Bush supervised, among many other projects, the Manhattan Project. Further, Carnegie scientists cooperated with the development of the proximity fuze and mass production of penicillin.|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} of the two storey Evaporator House and Alcohol Still House has been refurbished for use as offices, with a mezzanine level at {{the eastern end of}} the first floor. The original timber roof trusses survive above the <b>office</b> <b>cubicles,</b> there are small vents two thirds up the walls at regular intervals, and the ends of metal bolts can also be seen, ground-off flush with the brickwork. There is an outside stairway to the mezzanine level on the east face of the building, and there is a concrete ramp to the first floor entrance near the western end. Dormer windows {{have been added to the}} corrugated iron roof above the mezzanine floor.|$|R
