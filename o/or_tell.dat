5|$|In {{the first}} few years after publication, German readers widely assumed that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen was {{responsible}} for the stories. According to witnesses, Münchhausen was deeply angry that the book had dragged his name into public consciousness and insulted his honor as a nobleman. Münchhausen became a recluse, refusing to host parties <b>or</b> <b>tell</b> any more stories, and he attempted without success to bring legal proceedings against Bürger and the publisher of the translation.|$|E

25|$|Daghfal's son, Mufarrij, {{entered the}} {{historical}} record during the Fatimid struggle with Alptakin, a Qarmatian-backed Buyid commander who took over Damascus. Alptakin was defeated at the Battle of Ramla in 977, and Mufarrij captured him between Kafr Saba and Qalansawa to collect the 100,000 gold dinar-bounty placed on his head by the Fatimid caliph al-Aziz.

25|$|Psychiatric diagnoses {{take place}} {{in a wide variety of}} {{settings}} and are performed by many different health professionals. Therefore, the diagnostic procedure may vary greatly based upon these factors. Typically, though, a psychiatric diagnosis utilizes a differential diagnosis procedure where a mental status examination and physical examination is conducted, with pathological, psychopathological or psychosocial histories obtained, and sometimes neuroimages or other neurophysiological measurements are taken, or personality tests or cognitive tests administered. In some cases, a brain scan might be used to rule out other medical illnesses, but at this time relying on brain scans alone cannot accurately diagnose a mental illness <b>or</b> <b>tell</b> the risk of getting a mental illness in the future. A few psychiatrists are beginning to utilize genetics during the diagnostic process but on the whole this remains a research topic.|$|E

500|$|Kraemer, Cassidy, and Schwartz {{argued that}} [...] "Barge of the Dead" [...] {{mirrored}} the [...] episode [...] "Rightful Heir" [...] by not providing a clear answer whether Torres' {{experiences in the}} Klingon afterlife were real or part of a hallucination. The Native American studies scholar Sierra S. Adare was critical of the portrayal of Chakotay—a Native American character—as dismissive of Torres' sincere belief in her experiences, writing that [...] "o Native person would ever dismiss another's visions as hallucinations <b>or</b> <b>tell</b> them to ignore their religious beliefs". She cited it as one instance in which the series represented Chakotay as [...] "the quintessential Tonto in outer space".|$|E
500|$|Fincher had {{previously}} worked with director of photography Harris Savides on Seven (he shot the opening credits) and The Game. Savides loved the script but realized, [...] "there {{was so much}} exposition, just people {{talking on the phone}} or having conversations. It was difficult to imagine how it could be done in a visual way." [...] Fincher and Savides did not want to repeat the look of Seven. The director's approach to Zodiac was to create a look mundane enough that audiences would accept that what they were watching was the truth. The filmmakers also did not want to glamorize the killer <b>or</b> <b>tell</b> the story through his eyes. [...] "That would have turned the story into a first-person-shooter video game. We didn't want to make the sort of movie that serial killers would want to own," [...] Fincher said.|$|E

500|$|The {{cast and}} filmmakers {{attended}} several press conferences {{that allowed them}} to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message. The film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: [...] "Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in Thatcherite Britain... This is a response to {{the world in which we}} live today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities." [...] Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers <b>or</b> <b>tell</b> viewers what to think.|$|E
500|$|Sarah Whitney, in Investigating Veronica Mars: Essays on the Teen Detective Series, {{found the}} episode's {{portrayal}} of rape [...] "troubling". She wrote, [...] "On {{of the reasons}} this ending has always been problematic {{for me as a}} viewer {{is that it is a}} too-familiar script. Women are frequently told (<b>or</b> <b>tell</b> themselves) that they have [...] "misinterpreted" [...] sexual situations by missing cues ("leading men on") or by being [...] "unclear" [...] about their lack of consent. Furthermore, the episode leaves us bereft of a villain that can be nailed to the wall for forcible rape." [...] The writer went on to state that instead of placing the blame on a single person, [...] "A Trip to the Dentist" [...] blamed several people for Veronica's rape. Whitney also wrote that despite that the [...] "official resolution of the rape narrative denies a traditional 'whodunit' ending," [...] it makes a statement that she was raped by an [...] "unfeeling class of people." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{typically}} reviewed [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] favorably. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly {{felt the}} song was [...] "not bad business for stationary cardio, but not the stuff year-end top tens are made of, either." [...] She said it didn't offer [...] "major sensations" [...] and found it similar to Christina Aguilera’s [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] (2010). Greenblatt was also disappointed with the song's rhyming in the lines, [...] "I'm not here to sell ya' / <b>Or</b> <b>tell</b> {{you to go to}} hell". Sonya Sorich of Ledger-Enquirer said that while she anticipated some negative reception, [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] was also a prime candidate for a guilty pleasure dance track." [...] Heather Phares of Allmusic referred to [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] as [...] "stomping" [...] and selected it as one of the album's best. Fraser McAlpine of BBC said that though the song has strong sexual undercurrents, Cyrus maintained classy throughout the track [...] [...] "If Miley's gonna weather the Ensexification Moment it'll be because she's doing it during a period of extrema GaGa, when videos are less about acreage of flesh and more about feathers and Victorian scientists. Oh, and because she's got the songs and the voice, that always helps", McAlpine concluded.|$|E

500|$|In December 1986, Bono {{stated that}} he had a love–hate {{relationship}} with America, and that this influenced his work on the album. Speaking of his encounter with COMADRES in El Salvador and their impact on the song, he said, [...] "There's {{no question in my mind}} of the Reagan Administration's involvement in backing the regime that is committing these atrocities. I doubt if the people of America are even aware of this. It's not my position to lecture them <b>or</b> <b>tell</b> them their place or to even open their eyes up to it in a very visual way, but it is affecting me and it affects the words I write and the music we make." [...] In 2007, Clayton noted [...] "We were looking at this America through a European lens, at a time when Britain was under Margaret Thatcher who was breaking the miners.... So we were singing from the same hymn sheet as the Clash but with our spotlight focused on injustice inside and outside America." [...] He said [...] "'Mothers of the Disappeared' was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in Chile but also at the US which had supported that government", and described Bono's vocals as [...] "prehistoric", saying [...] "it connects with something very primitive." ...|$|E
