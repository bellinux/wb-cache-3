25|$|Uranium ISL {{uses the}} native {{groundwater}} in the <b>orebody</b> which is fortified with a complexing agent {{and in most}} cases an oxidant. It is then pumped through the underground <b>orebody</b> to recover the minerals in it by leaching. Once the pregnant solution is returned to the surface, the uranium is recovered {{in much the same way}} as in any other uranium plant (mill).|$|E
25|$|In-situ {{leaching}} (ISL), {{also known}} as solution mining, or in-situ recovery (ISR) in North America, involves leaving the ore where {{it is in the}} ground, and recovering the minerals from it by dissolving them and pumping the pregnant solution to the surface where the minerals can be recovered. Consequently, there is little surface disturbance and no tailings or waste rock generated. However, the <b>orebody</b> needs to be permeable to the liquids used, and located so that they do not contaminate ground water away from the <b>orebody.</b>|$|E

40|$|Part 1 of {{the paper}} defined shear loaded <b>orebodies</b> and showed through case {{histories}} that both pillars and excavations are at elevated risks of failure when mining these <b>orebodies.</b> Part 2 {{of the paper}} presents new knowledge on the behaviour of pillars and excavations when mining such <b>orebodies.</b> Numerical modelling is used to understand the behaviours of these structures in the <b>orebodies.</b> It is established that pillars in shear suffer confinement loss compared to their equivalents under pure compression. The confinement loss increases with increasing shear loading in pillars with width : height (W : H) § 1. For pillars with W : H § 1, the Lunder and Pakalnis (1997) empirical pillar design chart should be used with caution. For excavations in eccentrically loaded <b>orebodies,</b> passive and active high stress envelopes are created in the excavation process. The combined effect of the active high stress and tension zones often results in excavation surface sloughing...|$|R
50|$|Primary {{mineralization}} {{consists of}} pitchblende and coffinite, with weathering producing secondary mineralization. Sandstone deposits constitute about 18% of world uranium resources. <b>Orebodies</b> {{of this type}} are commonly low to medium grade (0.05-0.4% U3O8) and individual <b>orebodies</b> are small to medium in size (ranging up {{to a maximum of}} 50,000 t U3O8).|$|R

No extension was found and, to recoup money, the townships of Aberdeen (1849) and New Aberdeen (1872) were formed on company land. Stoppage of pumping at the Burra Burra Mine in 1877 caused {{a rise in the}} water level in the neighbouring Bon Accord Mine forcing it to also close. Mining activity lasted from 1846 until 1849, was restarted in 1858 and finally ceased four years later with no <b>orebody</b> having been discovered.

40|$|Although {{numerous}} W–Sn–Pb–Zn polymetallic deposits {{are located}} in southern Hunan, and In-bearing deposits are related to W–Sn–Pb–Zn polymetallic deposits, Indium mineralization in southern Hunan is poorly studied. In order to investigate the In mineralization of the Xianghualing orefield, which is a typical orefield in southern Hunan, ore bulk chemistry, microscopic observation, and electron-probe microanalysis of vein-type (type-I) and porphyry-type (type-II) Sn–Pb–Zn <b>orebodies</b> were studied. The In contents of the type-I <b>orebodies</b> varies from 0. 79 to 1680 ppm (avg. 217 ppm, n = 29), {{and that of the}} type-II <b>orebodies</b> varies from 10 to 150 ppm (avg. 64 ppm, n = 10). Although chalcopyrite and stannite contain trace amounts of In, sphalerite is the most important In-rich mineral in the orefield. Sphalerite in type-I <b>orebodies</b> contains from < 0. 02 to 21. 96 wt % In, and in type-II <b>orebodies</b> contains from < 0. 02 to 0. 39 wt % In. Indium-rich chemical-zoned sphalerite contains 7 to 8 wt % In in its core and up to 21. 96 wt % In in its rim. This sphalerite may be the highest In-bearing variety in Southern China. The Cd contents of the In-rich sphalerite ranges from 0. 35 to 0. 45 wt %, which places it in the the “Indium window” of the Cu–In–S phases. The geological and structural features of the Xianghualing orefield indicate that the In mineralization of the two types of In-bearing Sn–Pb–Zn <b>orebodies</b> is related to the volatile-rich, In-rich, A-type granites, and is controlled by the normal faults of magmatic-diapiric activity extensional features...|$|R
40|$|The source bed {{concept of}} ore genesis is {{the outcome of}} an attempt {{over the past several}} years to find answers to some of the {{outstanding}} problems of ore genesis [...] answers that would be of practical assistance in the diffi-cult task of finding new <b>orebodies.</b> The popular epi#enetic theory, which postulates that ore fluids derive from a magma, and the variants of this theory, which postulate an ore magma or a block of granitized sediments as the source of the sulfides, are of no practical use as an approach to ore finding. The syn#enetic theory also cannot be applied to exploration, and offers no explanation for the numerous <b>orebodies</b> that are undoubtedly controlled by structure and which must surely have the same origin as the bedded eposits for which the theory was advanced. The author's method of approach was to search for some phenomenon of ore habit common to several major <b>orebodies</b> or fields. One such phe-nomenon emerged from a study of many mining fields, namely, the strict correlation between stratigraphy and ore in several important fields; the <b>orebodies</b> in these fields are restricted to one particular sedimentary hori-zon. Moreover this principle of stratigraphic control could be used as an approach to finding new <b>orebodies</b> in a field. The source bed concept postulates that all sulfide <b>orebodies</b> of the ma- jority of fields are derived from sulfides that were deposited syngene-tically at one particular horizon of the sedimentary basin constituting the field, and that the sulfides ubsequently migrated in varying degree under the influence of rise in temperature of the rock environment...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies on}} the Mount Isa copper <b>orebodies</b> have {{assumed the role of}} the Paroo Fault, which has {{juxtaposed}} the Mount Isa Group against the Eastern Creek Volcanics, and forms a footwall to the copper and lead-zinc-silver <b>orebodies.</b> The copper <b>orebodies</b> have largely been considered to have formed during east northeast-west southwest shortening, late during the 1590 - 1500 Ma Isan Orogeny. This thesis examines the Paroo Fault from the km-scales to the sub mm-scales in order to understand its development and role in the mineralisation of the copper <b>orebodies.</b> Recent techniques such as Gaussian Curvature analysis, fold profile analysis, dilation and slip tendency analysis, spanned length analysis as well as established techniques such as thickness analysis and geological mapping have been used to examine the km-scales geometry of the Paroo Fault. This has lead to a new proposed timing for initial reactivation of the Paroo Fault during the final stages of deposition of the Mount Isa group, followed by folding during east-west shortening and refolding during east northeast-west southwest shortening. Detailed geological mapping of the Paroo Fault Zone at 10 s of m-scales supports the conclusions drawn from the macro-scale observations and suggests a new interpretation of the timing for the formation of the copper <b>orebodies,</b> before or early in the east-west shortening event, at Mount Isa. Re-examination of the mapping database collected by mine geologists (MIM and Xstrata Copper) has demonstrated that at the hunreds of metres scale, folds formed during the east northeast-west southwest shortening bend around the copper <b>orebodies,</b> indicating that the copper <b>orebodies</b> formed earlier than this event, consistent with conclusions drawn from the mapping of the Paroo Fault at the tens of m scale. Previously unrecognised east-west orientated folds which have no relationship to the copper <b>orebodies</b> and appear to predate them have also been recognised, indicating a phase of north-south shortening prior to ore genesis and prior to the east-west shortening. Halogen systematics on fluid inclusions from the copper <b>orebodies,</b> Paroo Fault Zone filling, silica-dolomite halo and basement rocks demonstrate that the ore system penetrated into the footwall, thus predating the sealing of the Paroo Fault Zones quartz-rich infill. The copper <b>orebodies</b> have a bittern brine source for halogens, which in the previous model for late metamorphic ore genesis, posed some problems because of the high Br/Cr ratios requiring an exotic (unknown) basin to have been placed above the Mount Isa Group during ore genesis. In the revised model here, such basinal brines are inferred to be residual evolved diagenetic brines within the Mount Isa Group or broader sedimentary package, which mixed with metamorphic fluids (with lower Br/Cl) during ore genesis, early in the inversion and shortening history...|$|R
25|$|Broken Hill {{was founded}} in 1883 by {{boundary}} rider Charles Rasp, who patrolled the Mount Gipps fences. In 1883 he discovered {{what he thought was}} tin, but the samples proved to be silver and lead. The <b>orebody</b> they came from proved to be the largest and richest {{of its kind in the}} world. Rasp and six associates founded the Broken Hill Proprietary Company (BHP), later BHP Billiton, and now BHP again, in 1885 as the Syndicate of Seven. By 1915 BHP had realised that its ore reserves were limited and begun to diversify into steel production. Mining at the BHP mines at Broken Hill ceased 28 February 1939. BHP was not the only mining operation at Broken Hill though, and mining continued at the southern and northern ends of the Line of Lode. Currently the southern and northern operations are run by Perilya Limited, who plan to open further mines along the Line of Lode.|$|E

The protruding tip of the <b>orebody</b> stood out as a jagged rocky ridge amongst undulating plain country on either side. This was known as the broken hill by early pastoralists. Miners called the ore body the Line of Lode. A unique mineral recently identified from Broken Hill has been named Nyholmite [...] after one of the city's famous sons Ron Nyholm (1917–1971).|$|E

The <b>orebody</b> extends eastward across a fault contact, at depth. East of the fault mineralization occurs in abundant sills and in the intruded sediments. Farther east, and deeper, the sills coalesce into a deeply buried granodiorite pluton. Mineralization and ore continue into the pluton.

40|$|The Late Archean Sunrise Dam {{gold deposit}} (~ 10 Moz) is hosted within greenschist-facies rocks and is {{characterized}} by extreme structural complexity, resulting from a protracted deformation history with evidence of structural reactivation and multiple phases of gold mineralization. Early Group I <b>orebodies</b> are hosted within shallow- to moderately dipping northwest-trending shear zones and occur in foliation parallel veins within a strong penetrative fabric. Group II <b>orebodies</b> occur within steeply dipping shear zones and are characterized by veins and breccias, and Group III and IV <b>orebodies</b> comprise dominantly stockwork veins. The <b>orebodies</b> formed in response to multiple episodes of deformation. Many structures were created during D 1 and D 2 shortening whereas {{the bulk of the}} gold was deposited during D 3 and D 4 that marks the transition from a dominantly lithostatic pore fluid regime to hydrostatic conditions. Two main fluid inclusion types were recognized at Sunrise Dam: low-salinity CO 2 -H 2 O inclusions and CO 2 inclusions. CO 2 -H 2 O inclusions are more common in the early Group I <b>orebodies.</b> These fluids were trapped under high P-T conditions during D 3 (minimum estimates suggest conditions were likely >~ 300 °C and > 1 to 3 kbars predominantly within the one-phase field). CO 2 -H 2 O inclusions that occur in later Group II and III <b>orebodies</b> were trapped predominantly within the two-phase field at temperatures 1 – 3 kbars) at a temperature > 300 °C. Shear failure along these structures resulted in widespread precipitation of moderate-grade gold mineralization from the CO 2 -H 2 O fluid. Continued deformation and exhumation modified P-T-X conditions, and cooling of the host rocks below 300 °C resulted in the CO 2 -H 2 O fluid entering the two-phase field. A combination of temperature decrease, a transition from lithostatic to suprahydrostatic and/or hydrostatic pressure conditions, fluid immiscibility, and the influx of a second CO 2 -rich fluid, resulted in fracture during D 4 and precipitation of high-grade gold mineralization in steeply dipping structures forming veins, breccias, and stockworks...|$|R

50|$|The {{mining method}} {{selected}} {{is determined by}} the size, shape, orientation and type of <b>orebody</b> to be mined. The <b>orebody</b> can be narrow vein such as a gold mine in the Witwatersrand, the <b>orebody</b> can be massive similar to the Olympic Dam mine, South Australia, or Cadia-Ridgeway Mine, New South Wales. The width or size of the <b>orebody</b> {{is determined by the}} grade as well as the distribution of the ore. The dip of the <b>orebody</b> also has an influence on the mining method for example a narrow horizontal vein <b>orebody</b> will be mined by room and pillar or a longwall method whereas a vertical narrow vein <b>orebody</b> will be mined by an open stoping or cut and fill method. Further consideration is needed for the strength of the ore as well as the surrounding rock. An <b>orebody</b> hosted in strong self-supporting rock may be mined by an open stoping method and an <b>orebody</b> hosted in poor rock may need to be mined by a cut and fill method where the void is continuously filled as the ore is removed.|$|E
