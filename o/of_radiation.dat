40|$|DE 102008050258 A 1 UPAB: 20100430 NOVELTY - The probe has a body (1), and {{radiation}} sources producing parallel bundle <b>of</b> <b>radiations</b> (2) e. g. laser radiation, with different radiation frequencies. Light conductors, coupling elements and coupling areas introduce the bundle <b>of</b> <b>radiations</b> into the body. A radiation-deflection body (3) arranged {{in the body}} reflects the bundle <b>of</b> <b>radiations.</b> A radiation outlet discharges the reflected bundle <b>of</b> <b>radiations.</b> The bundle <b>of</b> <b>radiations</b> falls on the deflection body with a concave reflection surface (4). A focus point (5) of the bundle <b>of</b> <b>radiations</b> falls on a surface (6) of a borehole to be tested. USE - Optical probe for testing surfaces of a borehole. ADVANTAGE - The provision of the radiation-deflection body simplifies structure of the probe, increases miniaturization of the optical probe, reduces adjusting complexity of the probe, and economically produces different probe body variants adapted to different borehole geometries...|$|R

5|$|As the {{radiation}} sources can be precisely positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy enables a high dose <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> {{to be applied}} to a small area. Furthermore, because {{the radiation}} sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level <b>of</b> <b>radiation.</b> It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.|$|E
