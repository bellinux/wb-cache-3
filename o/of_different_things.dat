5|$|At the office, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) announces to the {{employees}} that Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) {{will be his}} co-host at the Dundies. The Dundies are an annual award program created by Michael to motivate his employees. The idea of performance is worrisome to Deangelo, but Michael insists he take the job. Michael brings some of the staff together {{in the conference room}} to help Deangelo get prepared for the show, but he struggles to be humorous. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) tries to help him, saying he should just think of performing like conducting a meeting, but Michael objects, wanting Deangelo to mimic his style. Michael tries a number <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>things</b> to help Deangelo, such as sitting on his stomach and making him listen to a Walkman at full volume so he cannot hear himself think, but none are effective.|$|E

He told Guitar World in 1996, [...] "We're a lot <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>things...</b> I don't quite know what the mixture is, but there's definitely metal, blues, rock and roll, maybe a touch of punk.

Their sound had sometimes {{been compared to}} The Police, while Meany's rapping had been likened to the Beastie Boys. Adam LaClave stated the differing musical tastes of the band helped cultivate their sound: [...] "Each {{one of us is}} really into a lot <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>things</b> ... it helps make our sound because you can hear all kinds of things". Live performances were characterized by [...] sunglasses, futuristic costumes, and energetic showmanship. Many bands have influenced Earthsuit's style; the group has performed covers of songs by Basement Jaxx, Black Sheep, Kraftwerk, and The Talking Heads. They have also utilized samples by DJ Shadow and The Verve.|$|E

Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Marvin Gaye, Esther Williams, all kinds <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>things.</b> Once I saw that's the vibe she wanted, I still had to make it sound like the way my beats thump and stuff but still give her the atmosphere she's trying to bring out on the singing side.|$|E

[...] The word [...] "fuck" [...] doesn't just mean sexual intercourse. I mean, [...] "You're a stupid fuck," [...] "Are you going to fuck with me?" [...] "Fuck off!"...

That way the haters can't say anything, because you already said it". British rapper Dizzee Rascal appears as a featured artist on the English version of [...] "Loca".

5000|$|Bill's {{second album}} and first US release Panchpuran was {{produced}} by Karen Tweed (The Poozies, Swåp).

500|$|In an {{interview}} following the airing of the episode, Podeswa stated about {{the scene in}} which Jon Snow is resurrected; [...] "I think just establishing {{the right amount of}} tension through the scene, so you really didn't know up until the last second which way it was going to go. That was the biggest thing, creating a sense of mystery and magic around the whole thing. We really wanted that scene to be very beautiful, but also fraught with tension. That's the main thing we were looking for." [...] Podeswa also compared how he shot the scene to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt, continuing, [...] "It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow's body, really, but particularly the one where he's resurrected." [...] In another interview Podeswa described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting [...] "There was much discussion about what that actually was: There's this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a big moment or a small moment. We tried a lot <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>things,</b> but it really felt to me, and I think we all agreed, this first gasp of life, like what a baby has when it's born, is kind of what it needed to be. And I just thought he did that so great." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} {{team for}} Mega Man consisted of only six people. Inafune (credited as [...] "Inafuking") designed and illustrated {{nearly all of}} the game's characters and enemies, as well as the Japanese Rockman logo, box art, and instruction manual. He was also responsible for rendering these designs into graphical sprite form. [...] "We didn’t have [...] people, so after drawing character designs, I was actually doing the dotting (pixelation) for the Nintendo," [...] Inafune stated. [...] "Back then, people weren’t specialized and we had to do a lot <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>things</b> because there was so few people, so I really ended up doing all the characters." [...] Inafune was influenced by the eponymous protagonist of Osamu Tezuka's manga Astro Boy in his Mega Man designs. Mega Man is colored blue due to the NES console's technical limitations: the color has the most shades in the console's limited 56-color palette, and the expanded selection was used to enhance Mega Man's detail. Although he is often credited for designing the character, Inafune insists that he [...] "only did half of the job in creating him", as his mentor developed the basic character concept before Inafune's arrival. The basic sprites for Roll and Dr. Light were created before Inafune joined the project, and the designs for Cut Man, Ice Man, Fire Man, and Guts Man were in process. Aside from normal enemies, Inafune's first character was Elec Man, inspired by American comic book characters. The artist has commented that Elec Man has always been his favorite design. The designs for Dr. Light and Dr. Wily were based on Santa Claus and Albert Einstein, respectively; the latter character was meant to represent an archetypal [...] "mad scientist".|$|E

2500|$|Kaleidoscope later {{influenced}} several {{critically acclaimed}} musicians.

During a TV interview to promote The Head on the Door, Smith also included Kaleidoscope in a selection of his [...] "Top 5 all-time favorite albums.|$|R
2500|$|The Romanticist {{inquiry into}} the {{distinctive}} natures <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>things</b> is considered to explain why particular mental orientations or crucial turns of thought {{in the literature of}} the period are frequently marked by some kind of [...] "species" [...] identification. Probably the most dramatic example occurs in Frankenstein, when the title character -- after wavering between opposed truth-possibilities in a manner that recalls Scott's Edward Waverley -- finally finds himself (literally) in identification with his own species.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, {{the term}} [...] "coarse {{wavelength}} division multiplexing" [...] was fairly generic, and meant a number <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>things.</b> In general, these things shared {{the fact that}} the choice of channel spacings and frequency stability was such that erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) could not be utilized. Prior to the relatively recent ITU standardization of the term, one common meaning for coarse WDM meant two (or possibly more) signals multiplexed onto a single fiber, where one signal was in the 1550nm band, and the other in the 1310nm band.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the album}} was {{influenced}} by things such as macabre horror tales, zombies, and monsters, Donelly assured that {{the album was}} “always about something much more real", musing that [...] "there’s so much genuine evil in the world. That said, I love that people take all kinds <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>things</b> away from our songs, and invest so much of themselves in their interpretations.” To prevent the album from being to depressing, the band attempted to present the album with the aesthetic of a b-movie, with a comical, overly theatrical tone. Donelly also noted the desire to become more diverse musically with the second album, as the band had begun to listen to more sources of music.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork, Taylor said, [...] "I feel like the melodies on the new album are much more in-your-face, and it's more coherent."
