40|$|As {{one of the}} key {{components}} for the railway transportation system, the Train <b>Operation</b> <b>Diagram</b> can be greatly influenced by many extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Therefore, the railway train flow has shown the strong nonlinear characteristics, which makes it quite difficult to take further relative studies. Fortunately, the cellular automaton model has its own advantages in solving nonlinear problems and traffic flow simulation. Considering the mixed features of multispeed running trains on the passenger dedicated lines, this paper presents a new train model under the moving block system with different types of trains running with the cellular automaton idea. By analyzing such key factors as the maintenance skylight, the proportion of the multispeed running trains, and the distance between adjacent stations and departure intervals, the corresponding running rules for the cellular automaton model are reestablished herewith. By means of this CA model, the program of train running system is designed to analyze the potential impact on railway carrying capacity by various factors; the model can also be implemented to simulate the actual train running process and to draw the train <b>operation</b> <b>diagram</b> by computers. Basically the theory can be applied to organize the train operation on the dedicated passenger lines...|$|E

The core of the AMP architecture is the access network agency and both its specifications and the corresponding mobility management were designed using a combination of collaboration and <b>operation</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Given the scope and complexity of computer networks generally, and the Internet, specifically, the use of a network simulator was considered appropriate in providing a wider and comprehensive understanding of how the AMP architecture and protocol would perform in supporting a mobile host roaming over multiple network domains or autonomous systems.

The application of rough set-based attribute reduction obtains the important relative indicators by eliminating excessive and redundant evaluation indicators.

40|$|Single {{radioactive}} particle tracking {{was used}} to measure the overall solids residence time (and its distribution) in the riser of a CFB, operating at superficial air velocities (U) of 1 to 9 ms− 1 and solids circulation fluxes (G) between 20 to 600 kg m− 2 s− 1. The results demonstrate that the particle motion and mixing differ according to the operating mode of the riser, with a fairly constant velocity throughout the riser achieved in the dilute or dense riser flow, but with a significant amount of back-mixing for intermediate values of U and/or G. This back-mixing is due to the core-annulus mode of particle flow. Whereas experimental results and theoretical predictions are in fair agreement for the dilute and dense riser flow, the core-annulus regime needs to account for a U and G dependent slip factor (φ), in excess of the commonly proposed value φ = 2, especially at U–UTR < 2 ms− 1. Moreover, the previously published riser <b>operation</b> <b>diagram</b> is confirmed by the experiments, although a further analysis of the core-annulus regime is needed...|$|E
40|$|Mercury salts and organo-mercury {{compounds}} {{are among}} the most poisonous substances in our envi-ronment. The mechanism and extent of toxicity depend strongly on the type of compound and the redox state of mercury. Mercury has various techni-cal and industrial applications. An important tech-nical process which uses mercury is the chloralkali-elektrolysis based on the amalgam process. Through electrolysis of a salt solution the bulk chemicals chlorine gas and caustic soda are pro-duced. Because of the extreme toxicity of mercury and the enrichment in the food chain the contamina-tion of the environment with mercury must be pre-vented as far as possible. Therefore the waste water limit is at 50 µg/l and the drinking water limit at 1 µg/l within the European Community. Present clean-up solutions Available physico-chemical procedures for the clean-up of mercury-loaded waste water have large disadvantages. For example, ion exchange columns are sensitive and expensive. Precipitation by H 2 S requires handling of very toxic gas and produces large amounts of secondary mercury-contaminated media. Hydrazine precipitation needs toxic and ex-pensive chemicals and a large amount of energy consumption. The advantages of the biotechnologi-cal MERCURY-DECONTAMINATION-SYSTEM are that it is harmless to the environment, efficient, cost efficient and has a broad applicability.

40|$|CFBs {{are widely}} used in the chemical, mineral, {{environmental}} and energy process industries. Several authors {{stressed the need for}} a clear identification of the different operation regimes in the riser of a CFB, to ensure a better comprehension of the hydrodynamic context, and thus better define the operation and design parameters. First approaches to develop a “work map” of the riser operation, were presented by e. g. Grace[1], Yerushalmi and Avidan[2], Bai et al. [3]. It was further developed by Chan et al. [4] and Mahmoudi et al. [5, 6] for both Geldart A- and B-type powders, in terms of the operating gas velocity (U) and the solids circulation flux (G), which jointly delineate different regimes, called respectively Dilute Riser Flow (DRF), Core-Annulus Flow (CAF) (possibly with a bottom Turbulent Fluidized Bed, TFBB), and Dense Riser Upflow (DRU). For a given powder and its associated transport velocity, UTR, the combination of U and G will determine the flow regime encountered. Experiments in CFB risers of 0. 05 (2. 5 m high), 0. 1 and 0. 15 m I. D. (both 6. 5 m high), have demonstrated that common riser operations can be hampered by a specific (U,G) range where choking occurs. Angular sand, rounded sand, and spent FCC (all A-type powders) were used as bed material. Gas velocities were varied between 2 and 10 m/s, for solids circulation fluxes between 10 and 260 kg/m 2 s. Choking is understood as the phenomenon where a small change in gas or solids flow rate prompts a large change in the pressure drop and/or solids holdup during the gas-solid flow: the stable riser upflow regime is no longer maintained when G-values exceed a certain limit for a given gas velocity. Experimental results were empirically correlated, and proved to be about 30 % lower than predicted by the correlation of Bi and Fan[7], but largely exceeding other predictions.
