5|$|We {{were trying}} to avoid that whole game of who gets in first with the reviews. These days there's so much paper to fill, or digital paper to fill, that whoever writes the first few things gets cut and pasted. Whoever gets their opinion in first has all that power. Especially for a band like ours, it's totally the luck <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>draw</b> whether that person is into us or not. It just seems wildly unfair, I think.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, New Zealand {{hosted the}} Rugby World Cup. Unusually, France and New Zealand played twice at the tournament - both times at Eden Park. Both teams were in Pool A, and on September 24 New Zealand won their first {{encounter}} 37-17. New Zealand were pool winners, with France second. On either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>draw</b> for the knockout stage, both teams made the Final on October 23. New Zealand won 8-7. The match involved several controversial decisions by referee Craig Joubert, nonetheless {{for the second}} time New Zealand won a home World Cup with France runners up.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} pre-World War II year Cochet's pro status {{allowed him to}} accept {{the request of the}} Hungarian Davis Cup team to become its trainer. He was then invited to the inaugural World Pro Championships, which was held at the Roland Garros in June–July. Cochet and Tilden were on the same half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>draw</b> and it set up a {{semifinal}} clash which Cochet was forced out of the tournament in five sets. He and Ramillon had a shot at the doubles title but they came short against pro newcomer Don Budge and veteran Ellsworth Vines.|$|E

5|$|Writing for PC Gamer, Leif Johnson complimented {{the variety}} of {{multiplayer}} game modes available. This sentiment was shared by other reviewers who thought the multiplayer offering was considerably more diverse than what was typically available in most RTS games. Numerous critics regarded Blitz to be the standout multiplayer mode, however they were still apprehensive about its shortcomings. GamesRadar reviewer Robert Zak called Blitz the most forward-thinking area of Halo Wars 2, in contrast {{to other parts of}} the game which he thought were formulaic. Other writers agreed that the mode was an interesting twist on RTS and enjoyed playing it. While Blitz card packs could be earned through playing the game, both Bratt and Rignall still expressed disappointment about the inclusion of microtransactions for purchasing card packs. Johnson and Stapleton suspected that winning games in Blitz may be too reliant on the luck <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>draw.</b> Consequently, Stapleton thought the mode was unsuitable for competitive multiplayer but felt that the randomness and card mechanics worked well in the Firefight variant.|$|E

This made a draw unnecessary on the A side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>draw,</b> Cork and Galway were prevented from facing Kerry and Mayo respectively. On the B side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>draw,</b> Armagh had not met either of the teams {{and were able to}} play either Donegal or Dublin, but Monaghan's earlier game with Donegal meant that those two teams were kept apart, again making a draw unnecessary.|$|E
