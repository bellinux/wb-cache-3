50|$|Shortly {{after the}} family took {{residence}} in 1917, landscape designers Harries & Hall were engaged {{to design a}} fitting setting for the mansion. This was achieved by linking each principal room {{of the house to}} a terrace or garden area just outside and finally out into the beautiful wooded park. The site was further refined during the early 1920s by H.B. and L.A. Dunington-Grubb. The husband and wife design team created <b>spectacular</b> <b>outdoor</b> “garden rooms” including the Italian Garden, Sundial Garden, Summer House and the Sunken Garden. They also refined the South Terrace and designed the intricate lattice fencing for the tennis court and Italian Garden. The Dunington-Grubbs were influential in the development of their profession, were the founding members of the Society of Landscape Architects as well as Sheridan Nurseries.

50|$|A week later, their 5 June 1983 {{performance}} at Red Rocks Amphitheatre (an outdoor venue near Morrison, Colorado {{in the foothills}} of the Rocky Mountains that many travelling musicians consider the most <b>spectacular</b> <b>outdoor</b> venue in the United States) was recorded for what turned out to be a live album entitled Under a Blood Red Sky and concert film entitled Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky. A steady rain and the surreal, torch-lit natural beauty of the surroundings combined to present U2's performance in the most dramatic of contexts. Frequently shown on MTV, the video helped to further expand the band's American audience and rewarded the large financial risk the show had represented. The album used performances culled from the Red Rocks show as well as a 6 May show in Boston's Orpheum Theatre and a 20 August show in St. Goarshausen, West Germany at the Lorelei Amphitheatre. The Orpheum Theatre performance was also recorded and broadcast on the King Biscuit Flower Hour syndicated radio program.|$|R
40|$|People who {{traditionally}} find {{it difficult}} to enjoy and participate in Scotland 2 ̆ 7 s cultural and creative life can do so if activities are better planned and co-ordinated at local level. That 2 ̆ 7 s the finding from an evaluation of the Cultural Pathfinder Programme, which supported 13 pilot projects throughout Scotland over two years, exploring practical ways to get people involved in cultural activities. The projects reached out to groups who had previously faced barriers to participation, such as older people, vulnerable and rural communities, children and young people, and minority ethnic communities, ensuring an additional 50, 000 people across Scotland were able to explore and enjoy creative opportunities. Less formal approaches adopted by the projects allowed communities to determine their own cultural interests, shaping what happened in their area. Taking culture out of traditional venues and into local communities meant that activities could be enjoyed in familiar surroundings. Measures such as these were key to sustaining involvement and commitment from local people. Examples included: The creation of a community arts facility from disused buildings, bringing enterprise into a regeneration priority site in Clackmannanshire. The Highland Promise: a pledge scheme for school children in the Highlands during 2007 that enabled them to take part in activities to which they might not otherwise have access. Pupils themselves had a voice in shaping the options for their schools. In one primary school, every one of its 300 plus pupils performed in a professionally-produced, <b>spectacular</b> <b>outdoor</b> performance, attended by huge numbers from their local community. Bring your Baby project which gave families and carers of young children in areas of multiple deprivation across Renfrewshire and Inverclyde access to a range of cultural activities in local libraries. This promoted learning, literacy and life skills in a non-threatening environment...|$|R
5000|$|While in New York, Suesse studied piano under Alexander Siloti, Franz Liszt's last {{surviving}} pupil. She studied composition under Rubin Goldmark, one of George Gershwin's teachers, {{and spent}} three years studying with Nadia Boulanger after World War II. In 1931, bandleader Paul Whiteman (following Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue) commissioned her to write [...] "Concerto in Three Rhythms." [...] In early 1932, she recorded a piano roll of the Sammy Fain and Irving Kahal popular tune [...] "Was That The Human Thing To Do" [...] for the Aeolian Company's Duo-Art reproducing piano system. Beginning in 1930, Suesse formed a song writing partnership with impresario Billy Rose (usually in collaboration with other lyricists) that lasted into the 1940s. In 1936 Suesse lived in Fort Worth, Texas for three months to compose the score for Rose's Casa Manaña, the <b>spectacular</b> <b>outdoor</b> dinner theatre of the Fort Worth (Texas) Frontier Centennial. With Rose and Irving Kahal she composed [...] "The Night Is Young And You're So Beautiful," [...] which won fifth place on Your Hit Parade on the broadcast of February 6, 1937, and stayed on the program for six weeks. The Jan Garber, George Hall and Wayne King orchestras all recorded it in 1937, and in 1951 Ray Anthony's orchestra made it a hit again. On June 13, 1937 Amon G. Carter arranged for Billy Rose and Suesse to attend a dinner at the White House as guests of President and Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt. After dinner, music from Casa Manana was performed {{by one of the}} show's stars, Everett Marshall. Subsequently, many songs were written with Rose, including [...] "Yours For A Song" [...] (in collaboration with lyricist Ted Fetter), the theme of Billy Rose's Aquacade of the 1939 New York World's Fair. In the 1940s Suesse was Rose's staff composer for his legendary Diamond Horseshoe Revues. With lyricist E.Y. [...] "Yip" [...] Harburg Suesse wrote [...] "Moon About Town" [...] (for Jane Froman in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1934) and [...] "Missouri Misery", both published in 1934.|$|R
