5|$|Polled Dorsets are a {{medium-sized}} sheep that are long lived and prolific, heavy milkers. They produce hardy lambs with moderate growth and maturity that yield heavily muscled carcasses. Their fleece is very white, strong, close, free from dark fiber and extends down the legs. When shorn, fleece averages {{between five and}} nine pounds (2.23 to 4kg) in ewes and fifty to seventy percent of their fleece can be used. The staple length ranges from 2.5 to 4 inches (6 to 10cm) with a numeric count of 46's-58's. The fiber diameter ranges from 27.0 to 33.0 microns. At maturity, ewes weigh between 150 and 200 pounds (67 to 91kg), some weighing more in show condition. Mature rams range in weight from 225 to 275 pounds (102 to 125kg). Dorsets are noted {{for their ability to}} be bred more than once per year and are commonly used in crossbreeding to produce females for <b>out-of-season</b> <b>breeding.</b> They {{are one of the few}} breeds that have this characteristic. Multiple births are common and they work well in commercial operations, including programs where rams are specifically used to sire lambs for slaughter. These rams are known as terminal sires since their genetics are more suitable for slaughter than breeding purposes.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the reproductive performance of ewes exposed to a photoperiodic regimen consisting of continuous alternating 4 -mo periods of long days (LD: 16 h of light/d) and short days (SHD: 8 h of light/d) in an accelerated lambing program of 3 lambings in 2 yr. A total of 211 prolific Rideau Arcott ewes {{were assigned to the}} photoperiodic treatment, whereas 37 ewes were maintained under natural annual variation in day length (control group). Ewes under the photoperiod regimen were divided into 4 subgroups (A, B, C, D). All these groups of ewes were exposed to the same light regimen, but the LD and SHD light sequences were staggered by 2 mo to permit the evaluation of the effect of time and season of mating on performance of the ewes treated with the photoperiod. The control ewes were treated with intravaginal sponges in the <b>out-of-season</b> <b>breeding</b> periods (conventional approach). Each group of ewes was studied over 3 reproductive cycles. Two groups of rams exposed to alternating 2 -mo sequences of LD and SHD were used for mating. The short mean interval between ram introduction and conception for the groups exposed to artificial photoperiod (9. 4 d) confirmed the effectiveness of the treatment to induce intense sexual activity. For the 12 breeding periods studied (8 in out-of-season and 4 in sexual season), fertility rate of the ewes treated with photoperiod, mated at various times of year, was 91. 6 %, which is comparable with the fertility normally seen in the natural breeding season. The number of lambs born/ewe remained constant across reproductive cycles and was greater in photoperiod-treated groups (2. 81 vs. 2. 27 for photoperiod and control groups, respectively; P = 0. 0002). Groups exposed to photoperiod treatment obtained better fertility rate than the control group in <b>out-of-season</b> <b>breeding</b> (91. 1 vs. 76. 3 %; P = 0. 016). Ewes managed under the photoperiod regimen produced 1. 38 lambings/yr and 69 % of them lambed 3 times in 2 yr. Overall, the ewes in the photoperiodic treatment produced annually 3. 78 lambs/ewe. The reproductive performances achieved throughout the years indicate that the photoperiodic program tested, consisting of continuous alternating 4 -mo periods of LD and SHD, allows control of the annual reproductive cycles in ewes...|$|E
40|$|In each of two experiments, the {{reproductive}} performance of ewes naturally infested with sarcoptic mange and of uninfested ewes was assessed in in-season natural breeding conditions (experiment I) or in <b>out-of-season</b> controlled <b>breeding</b> conditions (experiment II). A {{statistically significant difference}} was observed in the total lambs born per ewe (infested ewes, 1. 2; controls, 1. 6), in the livebom lambs per ewe (infested ewes, 1. 2; controls, 1. 5) and in the lamb body weight per ewe (infested ewes, 3. 33 kg; controls, 4. 53 kg) under natural breeding conditions, {{as well as in}} the lamb body weight per ewe (infested ewes, 3. 37 kg; controls, 4. 14 kg) among ewes under controlled breeding conditions. No adverse effects were observed in the other reproductive indices, cycling rate, matting rate, retum-to-oestrus rate, abortion rate, lambing rate and stillbirth rate. Sarcoptic mange was observed in the offspring of infested ewes after 30 days and in the offspring of uninfested controls 60 days after their birth. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Spontaneous ovulatory {{activity}} (SOA) {{in spring}} {{has been used}} to study the <b>out-of-season</b> <b>breeding</b> ability of Merinos d'Arles (MA) ewes. Within this breed, an association was found between more intense seasonality and genotype -/- at a MnlI restriction site (allele 2 for its absence v. 1 for its presence) in Exon II of the MT 1 receptor gene. This study was designed to ascertain whether this association results in a direct effect of the MT 1 genotype on the expression of seasonality in MA ewes. In {{the first year of the}} study, genotyping of 314 MA ewes at locus MnlI was carried out and resulted in frequencies of 43. 0 %, 44. 9 % and 12. 1 % for genotypes +/+, +/- and -/-, respectively. The SOA of these ewes was determined in early April of two consecutive years by assaying plasma progesterone concentrations in two blood samples taken 9 days apart. Groups of 30 ewes of each homozygous genotype (+/+ and -/-) were identified from this population and their SOA was followed by taking blood samples at regular intervals between January and mid-April of the second and third year of the study. In the second year, groups of ewes were managed together on rangelands, whereas in the third year each group was split into two subgroups given differential feed levels. The results clearly showed that genotype had no significant effect on SOA during the 2 -to 3 -month period preceding the introduction of rams for spring mating. In the second year of the study, in which the experimental procedure allowed a fair comparison of the fertility of ewes in spring mating, fertility was similar for both genotypes. The reciprocity of the association was not demonstrated and the MnlI polymorphic site could not be used as a genetic marker of selection for <b>out-of-season</b> <b>breeding</b> ability, at least not in the MA breed. The percentage of cycling ewes significantly decreased between January and April, and older ewes (5 or 6 years old depending on the year of the study) were more cyclic than younger ones (2 and 3 years old, respectively). The differential feeding level of ewes from early February did not significantly affect their SOA during the time period studied in the third year of the study...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} feeding and {{management}} options for early lambing flocks were evaluated at the Knockbeg Sheep Unit, Carlow. Results {{and recommendations for}} on-farm adoption are summarised in this report. The ultimate objective was to develop cost-effective early lamb production systems in synchrony with the high price season from late March to early May. Studies were focused on the two main phases of lamb growth. Firstly, the period from birth to 6 weeks of age which coincides with the critical period of lamb survival and peak lactation in the ewe and, secondly, the finishing stage from 6 weeks until slaughter. Flock size was 230 to 250 ewes sponged in July/August for lambing in January and managed on 12. 6 ha of grass and forage. The results provide options in feeding and management for programmed lamb production in synchrony with early season prices. The production technologies are effective, e. g. <b>out-of-season</b> <b>breeding,</b> grass utilisation, planned schedules for achieving high levels of feed intake and lamb performance, drafting procedures for selecting high quality lambs (Fat class 3, Conformation classes U and R). On-farm planning for feeding, housing and labour is essential. End of Project ReportsEuropean Union Structural Funds (EAGGF...|$|E
40|$|Ewe {{production}} traits {{and ability to}} breed out of season were compared for the Dorper (DO), Katahdin (KA), and St. Croix (SC) breeds between 2000 and 2005. Sheep were managed on grass pasture and were supplemented with corn/soybean meal and free-choice, trace-mineral mix. Ewes were exposed to rams of their respective breeds in late summer (August/September), winter (December), or spring (April/ May) for 30 -day breeding periods. Lambs were weighed at birth and 60 days of age. Pregnancy and lambing rates and litter birth weight were greater for all breeds bred in winter and lowest in spring. Pregnancy losses were greater and birth weights reduced for DO and KA ewes {{less than two years}} of age bred in the spring compared with other seasons. Birth weights of lambs were not affected by season, but weaning weights were greatest for all breeds when ewes were bred in summer. Relative efficiency at weaning (kg of lamb produced/kg ewe weight) was greatest for summer-bred ewes and greatest for KA compared with DO and SC ewes. In summary, DO, KA, and SC ewes are capable of <b>out-of-season</b> <b>breeding</b> in Arkansas. However, relative efficiency and weaning weights were lowest for spring-bred ewes and fertility of yearling ewes of all breeds was reduced during spring breeding...|$|E
40|$|This review brings {{together}} information on ovarian physiology in buffaloes including folliculogenesis, ovulation, {{and the development}} and function of the corpus luteum. Features of embryonic development are also considered. The buffalo is classified as a short-day breeder but in equatorial zones can show oestrous cycles throughout the year provided that nutrition is adequate to maintain reproductive function. In sub-tropical zones and at higher latitudes, day length is often the major determinant of reproductive function including the occurrence of regular oestrous cycles, duration of oestrus, and the period to resumption of ovulation postpartum. Indeed, at higher latitudes buffaloes that give birth {{during the period of}} increasing day length may not show a resumption of ovulation until the following period of decreasing day length. This can {{have a major impact on}} the productive value of buffaloes and requires the development and utilisation of practical and effective assisted breeding technology for <b>out-of-season</b> <b>breeding</b> in buffaloes. Embryonic development in buffaloes occurs at a faster rate than in cattle and this has implications for the earlier establishment and functionality of the corpus luteum in buffaloes. It would appear that the interrelationships between the development of the early conceptus, corpus luteum function, uterine preparation, and maternal recognition of pregnancy, are more closely time-bound in buffaloes compared with cattle. The phase of embryonic attachment would seem to be a critical period for determining the reproductive outcome in buffaloe...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{efficacy}} of a recommended protocol of oral melengestrol acetate (MGA) to intravaginal medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), with or without equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG), for <b>out-of-season</b> <b>breeding</b> of sheep on Prince Edward Island. One hundred and twenty ewes were assigned to 1 of 4 groups in a factorial design and were treated with either an intravaginal MPA sponge or oral MGA. Ewes received either an intramuscular injection of eCG or a saline placebo at cessation of progestogen treatment. The reproductive performance was best for the MPA-eCG group, followed by the MGA-eCG, MGA-saline, and MPA-saline. Pregnancy rates of 66. 7 %, 43. 3 %, 31. 0 %, and 16. 7 %, respectively, and ratios of lambs born to ewes exposed to the ram of 1. 17, 0. 63, 0. 52, and 0. 23, respectively, were recorded for these groups. We concluded that, under the conditions of this study, the use of oral MGA resulted in fewer lambs than did the use of MPA sponges with eCG. Nonetheless, the use of MGA may be attractive to producers because it is less expensive and more convenient than the use of sponges.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the review is to {{describe}} the factors that affect fertility in domestic water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and the techniques that enable an improvement in reproductive performance. On Italian and Latin American farms where natural mating is practiced and bulls are always present in the herd, the inter-calving interval is approximately 400 days and the culling rate is lower than 15 %. The buffalo has a tendency for seasonal reproductive activity. Reproduction is favoured {{when there is a}} decrease in day length. Ovarian activity stops if conception does not occur within 3 to 5 ovarian cycles. It is important, therefore, that appropriate management of the transition period is practiced, particularly with respect to the hygienic conditions of the uterus. In tropical countries located north of the equator, feed deficiencies and heat stress are considered the main factors that lead to poor fertility in the summer. In Pakistan, for example, the increase in body condition score during the autumn was associated with the commencement of the breeding season in buffaloes. Anoestrus is observed also in Italy, however, where the average daily temperature during the same period is 13. 5 to 23. 5 degrees C and feeding is constant throughout the year. The only common element between the two areas is the progressive increase in daylight hours between April and June and the day length greater than 12 hours up to September. In Italian herds that apply an <b>out-of-season</b> <b>breeding</b> strategy, an improvement in fertility (measured as the percentage of corpora lutea corresponding to subsequent pregnancy) is observed when water pools are present on the farm. This demonstrates that an improvement in environmental conditions reduces the incidence of embryonic mortality and/or abnormal cycles. To summarize, in the absence of serious nutritional problems, an improvement in environmental conditions increases fertility in buffalo...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} eight {{experiments}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the requirement for thyroid hormones in neuroendocrine processes which lead to the seasonally anoestrous state in red deer hinds. The first two experiments used thyroidectomized, ovariectomized, oestradiol-treated hinds which received various thyroid hormone replacement treatments (n= 5 per group) to investigate the timing and dose-responsiveness of thyroid hormones in bringing about seasonal oestradiol-induced suppression of plasma LH concentration. A significant seasonal decline in mean plasma LH concentration during September (coinciding {{with the onset of}} anoestrus in entire cycling hinds in New Zealand) was observed in all thyroidectomized hinds in both experiments regardless of T₄ or T₃ treatment. When oestradiol implants were removed in November or December, mean plasma LH concentrations increased significantly in all but one of hinds in which T₄ had been administered at very low doses by subcutaneous implants, and mean plasma LH concentrations and LH pulse amplitude increased in approximately half of hinds administered T₃ at varying doses by subcutaneous injections over a one-week period in October. These results suggested that thyroid hormones are not required for steroid-dependent reproductive suppression, but could possibly play a role in steroid-independent suppression of LH secretion. Because problems were encountered in delivering appropriate doses of thyroid hormones in both experiments, further confirmation of these findings was required. Therefore in the next experiment the role of thyroid gland secretions was examined in euthyroid (n= 5) and thyroidectomized (n= 4) ovariectomized hinds treated with oestradiol implants. These implants were removed for about one month on three occasions to examine the effect of thyroidectomy on steroid-independent control of seasonal LH secretion. During the non-breeding season basal and GnRH-induced plasma LH concentrations declined in all hinds in the presence of oestradiol, but returned to breeding season levels when oestradiol was withdrawn in November. In a concurrent experiment, thyroidectomy of ovary-entire hinds (n= 7) during the breeding season prevented the cessation of oestrous cyclicity in spring; this was in contrast to oestrous cyclicity in T₄replaced (n= 4) or euthyroid control (n= 5) hinds which ceased to occur in early September. Collectively, these results indicate that thyroid hormones are required for the termination of the breeding season in cycling red deer hinds and that this action occurs via steroid-independent neuroendocrine pathways. Two experiments were conducted using neurotransmitter receptor agonists and antagonists to identify neural pathways in the brain which mediate LH suppression by oestradiol and by steroid-independent mechanisms, and to test if the thyroid gland is required for activation of these pathways during the non-breeding season. It was concluded from the lack of plasma LH responses to dopaminergic and opioidergic agonists and antagonists in ovariectomized and ovariectomized, thyroidectomized hinds (n= 5) that neural pathways involving dopamine-D₂receptors do not mediate oestradiol-induced seasonal suppression of plasma LH concentrations, and neither dopaminergic or opioid neural pathways mediate non-steroidal suppression of plasma LH concentrations. However preliminary evidence was obtained for a stimulatory role of serotonergic neural pathways in controlling LH secretion. Another experiment was conducted to identify when the steroid-independent mechanisms which suppress LH concentrations during the non-breeding season are responsive to thyroid hormones. T₄treatment at the beginning of or during the non breeding season was effective in bringing about suppression of plasma LH concentration in thyroidectomized, ovariectomized hinds (n= 5 per group), but this action of thyroid hormones did not occur during the breeding season. These results show that the steroid-independent mechanisms which contribute to seasonal suppression of plasma gonadotrophin concentrations require thyroid hormones to be present only from {{around the time of the}} end of the breeding season for their normal expression, and they remain responsive to thyroid hormones after this period. Lastly, the feasibility of achieving <b>out-of-season</b> <b>breeding</b> using thyroidectomized hinds (n= 9) was evaluated by comparing oestrous behaviour, ovulation and pregnancy rates to those of euthyroid control hinds (n= 7) following synchronization of oestrous cycles. There was a non-significant trend for a greater occurrence of oestrous behaviour and ovulation in thyroidectomized hinds compared with euthyroid controls during the non-breeding season, but the pregnancy rate following out-of season mating with a thyroidectomized stag was low, suggesting that a side effect of thyroidectomy may be impaired fertility. Six out-of-season pregnancies were obtained from eight matings, however because three of these pregnancies occurred in euthyroid control hinds no improvement in out-of-season reproductive performance could be attributed to thyroidectomy. It is likely that if the actions of the thyroid glands are to be exploited as a tool for achieving <b>out-of-season</b> <b>breeding</b> in this species, techniques will have to be developed for specifically blocking or overcoming the effects of thyroid hormones on the reproductive neuroendocrine centres without causing general hypothyroidism and its associated side-effects...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} the reproductive performance of Lacaune dairy ewes {{exposed to a}} light program and subsequent male introduction without (n =  36) or with (n =  36) an additional 6 -day progestagen treatment during the nonbreeding season. All ewes were exposed to extended day length (16  hours light and 8  hours darkness) for 77  days during winter (December 15 until March 2) followed by increasing natural photoperiod. At {{the end of the}} photoperiodic treatment, three blood samples were collected 6  days apart for progesterone (P 4) analysis to determine cyclic activity. One half of the ewes were additionally subjected to a 6 -day progestagen treatment in combination with PGF 2 α and eCG at insert withdrawal. Rams fitted with marking harnesses were introduced to females for 45  days and marked ewes recorded. Ewes exposed to the light program only were joined 40  days after the end of photoperiodic treatment, and ewes with additional progestagen treatment were joined 1  day after insert removal (40 - 44  days after the end of photostimulation). Lambing data were recorded and fertility (percentage of ewes lambing, lambing rate, and litter size) assessed to the first service period and overall. Mean serum P 4 concentrations were similarly (P >  0. 05) low in both groups (0. 4 - 0. 7  ng/mL vs. 0. 4 - 0. 6  ng/mL). On the basis of elevated P 4 levels (> 1  ng/mL), evidence of luteal activity was found in 27. 8 % of the ewes {{at the end of the}} light program. Estrus response was equally high (97. 2 %) and estrus distribution highly synchronized in progestagen-treated ewes (91. 7 % within 4  days). In ewes exposed to the light program only, estrous activity was recorded within 4  days (six ewes), from Day 8 to Day 17 (17 ewes) and from Day 19 to Day 25 (12 ewes) after joining. The percentage of ewes that lambed to the first service period was higher (P    0. 05) by the treatment. In conclusion, this study reports that exposition of Lacaune ewes to artificial long days followed by natural day length and male introduction is highly effective to induce fertile estrous activity during the nonbreeding season and offers a reliable and practical alternative to hormonal manipulation for <b>out-of-season</b> <b>breeding</b> in sheep...|$|E
40|$|Comunicación presentada en el 10 th International Symposium on Reproductive Physiology of Fish, celebrado en Olhao, Portugal, del 25 al 30 de mayo de 2014 The {{follicle}} stimulating hormone (Fsh) and the {{luteinizing hormone}} (Lh) are central endocrine regulators of gonad function in vertebrates. These gonadotropins act by binding and activating their specific receptors that are located in certain cell types of the gonads. In fish, the differential roles of these hormones are being progressively elucidated {{with the development of}} different tools for their study. In the case of European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax, the isolation of the genes coding for the gonadotropin subunits and receptors allowed in first instance for expression studies. Later, to overcome the limitation of native hormones, recombinant dimeric gonadotropins have been generated, which show different functional characteristics depending on the cell system and DNA construct. In addition, single gonadotropin beta-subunits have been produced and used as antigens for antibody production. This last approach has allowed the development of detection methods for native gonadotropins being the European sea bass one of the few species where both gonadotropins can be detected in their native form. The generation of antibodies has also allowed for their cellular localization and co-localization with other factors, helping {{to a better understanding of}} their function. By administration of the recombinant gonadotropins to gonad tissues cultured in vitro we have studied their effects on steroidogenesis, the activated intracellular pathways and their target genes. Their administration in vivo has also been tested both for basic studies and as a biotechnological approach. In this frame, it is known from different studies in mammals that exogenous administration of native hormones in cases of deficiency, including assisted reproduction, can be unsatisfactory due to their rapid clearance from circulation or limited availability. Other than the production of recombinant hormones gene-based therapies by using somatic gene transfer are offered as an alternative. Such an approach has been tested in sea bass for gonadotropin delivery in vivo. The hormones produced by the injected genes were functional and have allowed for different studies on gonadotropin action in spermatogenesis. All together, the use of gene therapy for hormone replacement in fish is a real alternative to the production of recombinant gonadotropins for in vivo use, due to the low cost of production and the high persistence of the injected DNA, and has a broad range of potential applications such as its use in <b>out-of-season</b> <b>breeding</b> programs or reproductive dysfunctions in fish species.
