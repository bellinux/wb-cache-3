5000|$|Typically, Train Controllers were {{stationed}} at district or [...] "divisional" [...] control offices which were linked by <b>omnibus</b> <b>circuit</b> telephone systems with selective code rings, to all signal {{boxes in the}} area. This method of operating was sometimes known as the Telephone Train Control System. If the Signalman required directions, he simply lifted the receiver {{and spoke to the}} Train Controller on the <b>omnibus</b> <b>circuit.</b> If the Train Controller wanted to issue instructions or receive train arrival and departure times, he selected the relevant signal box on his telephone, which rang the Control 'phone therein. There were two main problems with this system. Firstly, the Train Controllers could become overloaded with path requests from Signalmen, train recording and other duties. This led to delays for Signalmen waiting for their turn to speak on the <b>omnibus</b> <b>circuit,</b> making the role of the Train Controller somewhat self-defeating. Secondly, Signalmen were often {{in a better position to}} make train working decisions by virtue of their experience and by being on the spot, but were prevented from doing so by bureaucratic procedures. In silent admission of the deficiencies of this system, Signalmen were generally left to their own devices, especially in the event of a general disruption to train services, during which the train control system simply could not handle the demands placed upon it.|$|E
