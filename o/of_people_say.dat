[...] In an interview with MTV News, she compared it favorably to eating too much cheesecake: [...] "It's got a crazy loud beat, and the vocals are bitchy and loud. A lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> it sounds like Peaches, because of the delivery, the spooky vocals." [...] According to Furtado, the song is related to how people become [...] "hot on themselves" [...] when dancing in their underwear {{in front of a}} mirror.

[...] "I talked to her about my character... she explained to me how it was when she was young— the attitude and the flavor. And it’s funny, a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> that I act like she used to act at the skating rink.” Director Robinson was impressed by London and [...] "everything from her look, {{to the fact that}} she's new.

500|$|For the {{techniques}} used to craft the overall {{sound of the}} album, August Brown of the Los Angeles Times described the band foregoing the use of full chords and verse-chorus-verse structures in favor of [...] "distant guitar effects, crunchy bass grooves and smatterings of percussion." [...] Regarding the songs from the album, Maust said that lead singer Nathan Willett's lyrics were a mixture of folk tales and topical stories, stating that [...] "a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> the last record was more about yesteryear. This [...] has some of that, but it's much more today. The characters are people from today." [...] The thirteen tracks off the album deal {{with a variety of}} philosophies and politics that range from contemplating suicide, crisis of faith, alienation, anonymity, public security and job satisfaction.|$|E
500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated {{in an interview}} with Eurogamer, [...] "People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because we had all this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. Once you get to the level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. A lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions you asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the second question is a psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E
