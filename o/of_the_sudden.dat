5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{development}} of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources and partly because of the impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> large {{increase}} in the number of reported deaths in Hunan in a matter of hours, Chinese government officials accused local officials of covering up damage and casualty details.

5|$|The {{prolonged}} and escalating ByzantineSassanid {{wars of the}} 6th and 7th {{centuries and}} the recurring outbreaks of bubonic plague (Plague of Justinian) left both empires exhausted and vulnerable in the face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> emergence and expansion of the Arabs.

5|$|Nothing is {{mentioned}} of Strez until {{the events in}} the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> death of Tsar Kaloyan (1197–1207) during his siege of the Crusader-held Thessaloniki. Just like Alexius Slav, another noble who would later emerge as a separatist, Strez was a nephew of the Asen brothers Peter, Ivan Asen and Kaloyan, who were the first three emperors of the Second Bulgarian Empire. However, it is unclear whether through his relation to the early Asens he was a first cousin or a brother of Boril (1207–1218).|$|E
5|$|Strong ground motions {{caused many}} {{secondary}} effects, including gas leaks and widespread soil liquefaction. Consequently, sand boils emerged from asphalt roads, toppling a few cars and sinking another. Several {{houses in the}} hill suburbs of Sumner and Redcliffs were affected by falling boulders from hillsides. Following its occurrence, much of Christchurch lost water pressure; residents were thus urged to conserve water use. In {{some parts of the}} Heathcote Valley, previously dormant or non-existent natural springs surfaced as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> rise in the water table, flooding some properties.|$|E
5|$|The {{expense of}} {{resources}} during the RomanPersian Wars ultimately proved catastrophic for both empires. The prolonged and escalating warfare of the 6th and 7th centuries left them exhausted and vulnerable {{in the face}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> emergence and expansion of the Caliphate, whose forces invaded both empires {{only a few years}} after the end of the last RomanPersian war. Benefiting from their weakened condition, the Arab Muslim armies swiftly conquered the entire Sasanian Empire, and deprived the Eastern Roman Empire of its territories in the Levant, the Caucasus, Egypt, and the rest of North Africa. Over the following centuries, more of the Eastern Roman Empire came under Muslim rule.|$|E

5|$|On 21 May 2011, Aishwarya Rajinikanth {{released}} {{a photo of}} her and Rajinikanth in his hospital ward, both posing with a thumbs signal, responding to fans' negative reaction to news reports. The hospital restricted unauthorised visitors. Rajinikanth's brother, Sathyanarayana Rao Gaekwad, reported that the cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> illness was due to stress from rapid weight-loss and changes in diet, as well as withdrawal of alcohol consumption and smoking cessation. After addressing fans in a 4-minute digitally recorded voice message to the media, Rajinikanth, under the advice of Amitabh Bachchan, travelled from Chennai to Singapore with his family on 21 May 2011, where he was to undergo further treatment for nephropathy at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. After spending over two weeks at the hospital, he was finally discharged on 15 June 2011 and continued to recuperate in Singapore, before returning to Chennai on 13 July 2011.|$|E

25|$|Fast bowling puts extreme {{pressure}} on the whole body, especially the feet, back and the shoulder. It {{puts a lot of}} body parts under extreme risk of injury. There is a risk of stress fractures in the ankles because of the feet landing hard on the ground at the time of delivery, back spasms and strains because of the arching movement when the ball is delivered and torn ligaments in the shoulder because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> jerk that invariably occurs just before the ball is bowled.|$|E

25|$|The {{engineers}} waited {{the whole}} month of July for Wise to arrive on scene. By 19 July 1861, McDowell started {{calling for a}} balloon {{to be brought to}} the front at First Bull Run (Centreville). As Wise was not to be found, Whipple sent Lowe out to inflate his balloon and prepare to set out for Falls Church. Mary Hoehling tells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> appearance of John Wise who demanded that Lowe stop his inflating of the Enterprise and let him inflate his balloon instead. Wise had legal papers upholding his purported authority. Although Wise's arrival on the scene was tardy, he did inflate his balloon and proceeded toward the battlefield. On the way the balloon became caught in the brush and was permanently disabled. This ended Wise's bid for the position, and Lowe was at last unencumbered from taking up the task.|$|E
25|$|The Transoxiana {{region was}} conquered by Qutayba ibn Muslim between 706 and 715 and loosely {{held by the}} Umayyads from 715 to 738. This conquest was {{consolidated}} by Nasr ibn Sayyar between 738 and 740. It was under the Umayyads from 740-748 and under the Abbasids after 748. Sindh, attacked in 664, would be subjugated by 712. Sindh became the easternmost province of the Umayyad. The Umayyad conquest of Hispania (Visigothic Spain) would begin in 711 and end by 718. The Moors, under Al-Samh ibn Malik, swept up the Iberian peninsula and by 719 overran Septimania; the area would fall under their full control in 720. With the Islamic conquest of Persia, the Muslim subjugation of the Caucasus would take place between 711 and 750. The end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> Islamic Caliphate expansion ended around this time. The final Islamic dominion eroded {{the areas of the}} Iron Age Roman Empire in the Middle East and controlled strategic areas of the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|The local coal {{industry}} {{was at the}} forefront <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> dramatic decline of the British coal mining industry, which was precipitated by a change of government economic policy in the early 1980s. This had very severe knock-on effects in the many reliant local industries, and caused much local hardship. The 1985 miners' strike was sparked by the impending closure of Cortonwood Colliery in Brampton Bierlow, a neighbouring village often considered a part of Wath. Along with {{the whole of the}} Dearne Valley, Wath was classified as an impoverished area and received much public money, including European funds. These were put into regenerating the area from the mid-nineties onward causing a certain amount of economic revival, and changing the character of the area to be more rural as large areas of ex-industrial land {{to the north of the}} town which were once collieries and railway marshalling yards were turned back into scrubland and countryside, dotted with light industrial and commercial office parks. This regeneration has now progressed such that the reclaimed countryside, as it still classified as brownfield land, has been built over with various industrial and commercial parks, and large housing developments have also been started.|$|E

25|$|Prome {{attacked}} Toungoo in 1595. Prome and Ava {{fought for}} central Burma in 1596–97. Prome and Toungoo later agreed to attack Ava in 1597 but Toungoo broke off the alliance and attacked Prome in 1597. In the central mainland, Lan Xang and Lan Na {{went to war}} in 1595–96 and again in 1598–1603. Siam supported a Chiang Rai rebellion against Lan Na (Chiang Mai) in 1599. By 1601, Lan Na was divided into three spheres: Chiang Mai, Siam-backed Chiang Rai, Lan Xang-backed Nan. Chiang Mai defeated the Siam-backed rebellion in Chiang Rai in 1602 only to submit to Ayutthaya later that year. Chiang Mai retook Nan from Lan Xang in 1603. In the western mainland, Siam invaded Lower Burma in 1600, {{and went on to}} attack Toungoo only to be driven back by Toungoo’s ally Arakan. The Portuguese garrison at Syriam switched allegiance from Arakan to Goa in 1603. Siamese vassal Martaban then entered into an alliance with Portuguese Syriam. Ava had seized cis-Salween Shan states by 1604. Siam planned to invade Ava’s vassal southern Shan states in 1605 before cancelling it because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> death of its warrior king Naresuan (r. 1590–1605). Ava conquered Prome (1608), Toungoo (1610), Portuguese Syriam (1613), Siamese Martaban and Tavoy (1613), and Lan Na (1614).|$|E
25|$|After {{the mass}} unrest due to missing of holy relic from the Hazratbal Shrine on 27 December 1963, the State Government dropped all {{charges in the}} Kashmir Conspiracy Case as a {{diplomatic}} decision, on 8 April 1964. Sheikh Abdullah was released and returned to Srinagar where he was accorded a great welcome {{by the people of}} the valley. After his release he was reconciled with Nehru. Nehru requested Sheikh Abdullah to act as a bridge between India and Pakistan and make President Ayub to agree to come to New Delhi for the talks for a final solution of the Kashmir problem. President Ayub Khan also sent telegrams to Nehru and Sheikh Abdullah with the message that as Pakistan too was a party to the Kashmir dispute any resolution of the conflict without its participation would not be acceptable to Pakistan. Sheikh Abdullah went to Pakistan in the spring of 1964. President Ayub Khan of Pakistan held extensive talks with him to explore various avenues for solving the Kashmir problem and agreed to come to Delhi in mid June for talks with Nehru as suggested by him. Even the date of his proposed visit was fixed and communicated to New Delhi. However, while Abdullah was still in Pakistan, news came <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> death of Nehru on 27 May 1964.

25|$|UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz, referee John McCarthy {{and a team}} {{of lawyers}} were in court until 4:30p.m. {{on the day of the}} fight battling with the District Attorney of Michigan, who was trying to prevent the UFC from holding the event in the state. An {{ultimatum}} was issued: the fight could go on as long as there were no closed fisted strikes to the head and no headbutts. The UFC, desperate to put the show on, agreed to the terms. Fighters were warned hours before the show that they would be arrested if they punched to the head with a closed fist. When Shamrock learned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> rule change, he made up his mind that he was not going to fight. While training for the match, Shamrock suffered a torn lateral meniscus, a partially torn ACL, a broken nose, and cracked ribs. His injuries combined with the rule change, he did not think he could win the fight because all of his weapons were taken away from him. Shamrock was also fearful that he would be arrested; the troubled boys from his father's foster home would be watching him and he was afraid of setting a bad example. If Shamrock withdrew, the main event would have been cancelled and the UFC could have suffered substantial monetary damage. After UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz and other UFC officials pleaded with Shamrock to go on with the show, Shamrock, despite the injuries and new rules, reluctantly gave in to the pressure.|$|E
