5|$|At {{the time}} of the North Korean invasion, the closest American ground force was the 24th Infantry Division, which was based in Japan. This {{division}} had fewer than its normal contingent of soldiers, and most of its equipment was rather old due to the U.S. Congress's reductions in military spending. In any case, the 24th Infantry Division was the <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Army that was available to quickly reinforce South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Badr {{began at}} 14:00 on October 6, 1973. As the Israelis {{expected}} the attack to begin four hours later, <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troops {{and none of}} the armor assigned to man the Bar Lev Line were in position, except for a few platoons in the northernmost forts. Sixteen fortifications on the line were fully manned, and another two were partially manned.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} seen by Llwyd, Jones and Glynne was {{demolished}} {{and the present}} structure was erected, designed by Henry Kennedy, architect of the Diocese of Bangor.

5|$|The film's idea {{resulted}} from a small scale exercise between Nemescu and Liviu Marghidan {{when they were in}} university in 2003. The original idea belonged to Cătălin Mitulescu and Andreei Vălean; the <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original story that was kept is that of a group of boys trying to steal a trolleybus {{in order to get to}} some prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun is obscured.|$|E
5|$|By 1892, Imaginos {{is living}} in a mansion in Cornwall and has a nine-year-old granddaughter. Having by this time spent several decades {{studying}} mysticism and astrology, Imaginos discovers that Elizabethan England's rise as a superpower coincided with John Dee's acquisition of a magic obsidian mirror from Mexico, {{which serves as a}} bridge between Les Invisibles' alien world and ours, and the means to spread their influence on Earth. Some fans see Les Invisibles' actions in favour of England against Spain as a sort of vengeance for the extermination by the conquistadores of their worshippers in Central America, while others view their intervention as <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mysterious scheme carried on by the alien entities through the centuries ("In the Presence of Another World").|$|E

5|$|Deptford borders {{the areas}} of Brockley and Lewisham to the south, New Cross {{to the west and}} Rotherhithe to the north west; Deptford Creek divides it from Greenwich to the east, and the River Thames {{separates}} the area from the Isle of Dogs to the north east; it is contained within the London SE8 post code area. The area referred to as North Deptford is the <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> London Borough of Lewisham to front the Thames and is sandwiched between Rotherhithe and Greenwich. Much of this riverside estate is populated by the former Naval Dockyards, now known as Convoys Wharf, the Pepys Estate and some eastern fringes of the old Surrey Commercial Docks.|$|E
5|$|Each section, such as on {{reptiles}} at {{the start}} of Volume II (and the entire work) is introduced with an essay on distinguishing aspects of their zoology. In the case of the reptiles, the essay begins with the observation that their circulation is so arranged that <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blood pumped by the heart goes through the lungs; Cuvier discusses the implications of this arrangement, next observing that they have a relatively small brain compared to the mammals and birds, and that none of them incubate their eggs.|$|E
5|$|In older {{children}} and adolescents, {{the symptoms of}} hypothyroidism may include fatigue, cold intolerance, sleepiness, muscle weakness, constipation, a delay in growth, overweight for height, pallor, coarse and thick skin, increased body hair, irregular menstrual cycles in girls, and delayed puberty. Signs may include delayed relaxation of the ankle reflex and a slow heart beat. A goiter may be present with a completely enlarged thyroid gland; sometimes <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thyroid is enlarged {{and it can be}} knobby in character.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal {{expanded}} the scope of judicial review by adopting an objective test when reviewing the exercise of executive discretion. In contrast to the subjective test, the objective test permits the court to examine whether the decision-maker's satisfaction was based on objective facts which fell {{within the scope of}} the purposes specified by the ISA. The subjective satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient. However, the adoption of this objective test was <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obiter dicta of the case. The ratio decidendi of the case was based on narrower technical grounds.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota is {{the second}} northernmost U.S. state (after Alaska). Its {{isolated}} Northwest Angle in Lake of the Woods county is the <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 48 contiguous states lying north of the 49th parallel. The state {{is part of the}} U.S. region known as the Upper Midwest and part of North America's Great Lakes Region. It shares a Lake Superior water border with Michigan and a land and water border with Wisconsin to the east. Iowa is to the south, North Dakota and South Dakota are to the west, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba are to the north. With , or approximately 2.25 percent of the United States, Minnesota is the 12th-largest state.|$|E
5|$|Orford Castle {{was given}} to the Ministry of Works in 1962, and is now {{maintained}} by English Heritage. The keep of the castle is the <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure remaining intact, although the earthwork remains of the bailey wall are still visible; some of the ditches visible amongst the earthworks, however, are not medieval, but instead the result of the earlier quarrying of the bailey walls. The Orford Museum Trust has created exhibits in the upper hall featuring displays of archaeological artefacts found locally. Archaeological work to understand the surrounding environment has continued, most recently during 2002 to 2003. The castle is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} Gregory's main motivation was {{to increase the}} number of Christians; others wonder if more political matters such as extending the primacy of the papacy to additional provinces and the recruitment of new Christians looking to Rome for leadership were also involved. Such considerations may have also played a part, as influencing the emerging power of the Kentish Kingdom under Æthelberht could have had some bearing on the choice of location. Also, the mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the Lombards. At the time of the mission Britain was the <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Roman Empire which remained in pagan hands and the historian Eric John argues that Gregory desired to bring the last remaining pagan area of the old empire back under Christian control.|$|E
5|$|The H. Lee House, a {{historic}} site built in 1928, was relocated by Caltrans {{at a cost}} of $1.5 million to the City Center Park in Lemon Grove. The portion from SR 94 to Jamacha Boulevard was completed in 2003, {{at a cost of}} $277 million; at this time, the <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freeway from SR 54 to SR 52 not complete was between Navajo Road and Grossmont College Drive. During the construction, residents were inconvenienced by dirt, excess noise, and lights operating at nighttime. The entire freeway from SR 52 to I-8 was completed by mid-2004.|$|E
5|$|The Thanhouser {{production}} is {{an adaptation of}} <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel. The film departs significantly from the original plot, {{such as in the}} omission of the double-wedding scene. It begins with Dr Charles Primrose, the vicar of Wakefield, attending a picnic with his landlord Squire Thornhill. The vicar does not like Squire Thornhill, who is reputed to be a degenerate young man, but he has no reservations once he sees Thornhill's interest in his daughter, Olivia. The next scene shows Squire Thornhill convincing Olivia to elope with him, so the two can be married. But Squire Thornhill has no intention of marrying her, and commissions a farmer to arrange a fake wedding ceremony. The farmer accepts, but shakes his fist in anger at the squire after he has departed.|$|E

50|$|In 1908, a new {{building}} was built {{for high school students}} at 10th Street and Walnut Street. Two new wings were later added, which are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building surviving today.|$|R
5|$|The {{epilogue}} is the <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film in colour {{and shows}} time-aged, but still vibrant, details {{of several of}} Andrei Rublev’s actual icons.

The final scene crossfades from the icons and shows four horses standing by a river in the rain.|$|E
5|$|The <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{region that}} is {{predominantly}} {{given over to}} crops is the land around the Humber estuary, where the well-drained fens result in excellent quality land. The lowland Cheshire Plain is mostly given over to dairy farming, while in the Pennines and Cheviots grazing sheep {{play an important role}} not just in agriculture but also in land management more generally. Heather moorland in the Pennine uplands is home to driven grouse shooting from 12 August (the Glorious Twelfth) until 10 December every year. In the twentieth century, numbers of red grouse and black grouse in the area fell significantly, but improved gamekeeping practices have resulted in both species making a comeback in the region.|$|E
5|$|The sports venues {{were taken}} over by the {{respective}} municipalities. The Lillehammer venues are owned by the municipal Lillehammer Olympiapark, while similar companies were created for Hamar and Gjøvik. The International Broadcasting Center was built as a future campus for Lillehammer University College. The Main Press Center was converted to a business park. <b>Only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> athlete accommodation was built for permanent use, and was sold as regular housing after the Games. The rest was built as mobile units and sold {{to other parts of the}} country. Similarly, the media accommodation was built as a mix of permanent and temporary housing, with the latter being sold as cottages after the Games were completed.|$|E
