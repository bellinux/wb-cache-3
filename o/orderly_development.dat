500|$|Legal {{certainty}} and the <b>orderly</b> <b>development</b> {{of legal}} principles are {{promoted by the}} application of the doctrine of stare decisis, also known as the doctrine of binding precedent. According to this doctrine, the decisions of higher courts are binding on lower courts. Thus, judgments of the Court of Appeal are binding on the High Court, and judgments of both of these superior courts are binding on subordinate courts. A judge is generally not bound by previous decisions made by other judges in courts of the same level. Thus, a judge hearing a High Court case need not follow previous High Court decisions. Nonetheless, courts generally do so as a matter of comity, unless there are good reasons for doing otherwise. As the final appellate court in Singapore, the Court of Appeal is not bound by its previous decisions or those of predecessor courts such as the Privy Council. However, the Court continues to treat such decisions as [...] "normally binding" [...] and only departs from them [...] "where adherence to such prior decisions would cause injustice in a particular case or constrain the development of the law in conformity with the circumstances of Singapore". Only the ratio decidendi (that is, the legal principle that determines the outcome) of a case is binding according to the doctrine of stare decisis; other legal principles expressed that are not crucial to the final decision (obiter dicta) are only persuasive.|$|E

50|$|The other {{comparable}} {{regional model}} is the coal company town. Here everything was built following a company engineer's formula — from street layout to house plan — and most every structure reflected a hierarchy of design. Roaring Spring, by contrast, contains few, if any, of the coal company town's typical two-story semi-detached frame dwellings that fill the checkerboard streets of places like Colver (est. 1890s) in Cambria County or Windber (est. 1910s) in Somerset County.18 And while Roaring Spring's patriarchal management may have desired <b>orderly</b> community <b>development,</b> it did not impose a blatantly class-structured environment on its work force.|$|R

60|$|Probably {{the truth}} of the matter is to be found somewhere between these two extremes. Of his great genius there can be no question; but there are other things to consider. As we have already noticed, Shakespeare was trained, like his fellow workmen, first as an actor, second as a reviser of old plays, and last as an {{independent}} dramatist. He worked with other playwrights and learned their secret. Like them, he studied and followed the public taste, and his work indicates at least three stages, from his first somewhat crude experiments to his finished masterpieces. So it would seem that in Shakespeare we have the result of hard work and of <b>orderly</b> human <b>development,</b> quite as much as of transcendent genius.|$|R
2500|$|The Commissioners {{published}} {{their plan}} in March 1811 {{in the form}} of an eight-foot map [...] redrawn by the otherwise little known William Bridges from Randel's original, and engraved by Peter Maverick [...] with an accompanying 54-page pamphlet. The grid had 12 primary north-south avenues and numerous cross streets arranged in a regular right-angled grid tilted 29 degrees west of true north to roughly replicate the angle of Manhattan island. [...] The Commission chose not to use circles and ovals such as Pierre L'Enfant had used in his design of Washington D.C., convinced that simple rectangles were best, the most convenient and easiest to build on, and therefore the most conducive to the <b>orderly</b> <b>development</b> of the city. The combination of north-south avenues and east-west streets at the specified dimensions was the creation of approximately 2000 long, narrow blocks.|$|E

The role of the Commission is to periodically review and revise the Schedule to the Convention, controlling the conduct of whaling by setting the protection of certain species; designating areas as whale sanctuaries; setting limits on the numbers and size of catches; prescribing open and closed seasons and areas for whaling; methods and intensity of whaling, types of gear to be used, methods of measurement and maximum catch returns.

2500|$|The province's population, after 1930, {{began to}} grow disproportionately quickly in the {{suburban}} areas of Buenos Aires. These suburbs had grown to include 4 million out of the province's total 7 million people in 1960. Much of the area these new suburbs were developed on (particularly the poorer ones) consisted of wetlands and were prone to flooding. To address this, Governor Oscar Alende initiated the province's most important flood-control project to date, the Roggero Reservoir. Completed a decade later, in 1971, the reservoir and associated electric and water-treatment facilities encouraged still more, and more <b>orderly,</b> <b>development</b> of the Greater Buenos Aires region, which today includes around 10 million people ( [...] of the provincial population). It did not address worsening pollution resulting from the area's industrial growth, which had made itself evident since around 1920. This problem has been at its worst along the Reconquista River west and {{north of the city}} of Buenos Aires; over 4 million people (one in 10 Argentines) today live on the Reconquista's basin. Of these, about a million still live with seriously compromised water quality, despite the province's (sometimes counterproductive) efforts to remedy the issue.|$|E

40|$|During {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, the economy of the Great Basin region of the western United States was subject to two {{competing}} forces.

Much of the Great Basin 2 ̆ 7 s economic history revolves around the theocracy 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to maintain control over the economy in the face of increasing market pressures. One important part of Mormon economic policy was the stabilization of prices for agricultural commodities and the stockpiling of adequate supplies of food staples as a hedge against crop failure.
