5|$|Gene {{transfer}} between species {{includes the}} formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria. In medicine, this contributes {{to the spread of}} antibiotic resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species. Horizontal transfer <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki bean weevil Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers, which have received a range <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> from bacteria, fungi and plants. Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing transfer <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> even across biological domains.|$|E

40|$|Background Despite {{sharing the}} same genes, {{identical}} twins demonstrate substantial variability in behavioral traits and in their risk for disease. Epigenetic factors–DNA and chromatin modifications that affect levels <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression without affecting the DNA sequence–are thought {{to be important in}} establishing this variability. Epigenetically-mediated differences in the levels <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression that are associated with individual variability traditionally are thought to occur only in a gene-specific manner. We challenge this idea by exploring the large-scale organizational patterns <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression in an epigenetic model of behavioral variability. Methodology/Findings To study the effects of epigenetic influences on behavioral variability, we examine gene expression in genetically identical mice. Using a novel approach to microarray analysis, we show that variability in the large-scale organization <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression levels, rather than differences in the expression levels <b>of</b> specific <b>genes,</b> is associated with individual differences in behavior. Specifically, increased activity in the open field is associated with increased variance of log-transformed measures <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in open field activity. Early life experience that increases adult activity in the open field also similarly modifies the variance <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression levels. The same association of the variance <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression levels with behavioral variability is found with levels <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression in the hippocampus of genetically heterogeneous outbred populations of mice, suggesting that variation in the large-scale organization <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression levels may also be relevant to phenotypic differences in outbred populations such as humans. We find that the increased variance in gene expression levels is attributable to an increasing separation of several large, log-normally distributed families <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression levels. We also show that the presence of these multiple log-normal distributions <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression levels is a universal characteristic <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression in eurkaryotes. We use data from the MicroArray Quality Control Project (MAQC) to demonstrate that our method is robust and that it reliably detects biological differences in the large-scale organization <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression levels. Conclusions Our results contrast with the traditional belief that epigenetic effects on gene expression occur only at the level <b>of</b> specific <b>genes</b> and suggest instead that the large-scale organization <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression levels provides important insights into the relationship <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression with behavioral variability. Understanding the epigenetic, genetic, and environmental factors that regulate the large-scale organization <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression levels, and how changes in this large-scale organization influences brain development and behavior will be a major future challenge in the field of behavioral genomics...|$|R

5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences.

Chris Ponting and Robert Russell identified a circularly permuted version of a saposin inserted into plant aspartic proteinase, which they nicknamed swaposin. Saposin and swaposin were the first known case of two natural genes related by a circular permutation.|$|E

40|$|A {{formula for}} the {{variance}} <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> identity (homozygosity) was derived {{for the case}} of neutral mutations using diffusion approximations for the changes <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> frequencies in a subdivided population. It is shown that when gene flow is extremely small, the variance <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> identity for the entire population at equilibrium is smaller {{than that of the}} panmictic population with the same mean gene identity. On the other hand, although a large amount <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> flow makes a subdivided population equivalent to a panmictic population, there is an intermediate range <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> flow in which population subdivision can increase the variance. This increase results from the increased variance between colonies. In such a case, each colony has a predominant allele, but the predominant type may differ from colony to colony. The formula for obtaining the variance allows us to study such statistics as the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> differentiation and the correlation of heterozygosity. Computer simulations were conducted to study the distribution <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> identity as well as to check the validity of the analytical formulas.

5|$|Gene flow {{involves}} the exchange <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> between populations and between species. The {{presence or absence}} of gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution.
