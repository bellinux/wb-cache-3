5|$|Horses have a {{great sense}} of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly {{developed}} proprioception—the unconscious sense <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> body and limbs are at all times. A horse's sense of touch is well developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.|$|E

This account states that by September 2010, these leads followed a courier to the Abbottabad compound, where the U.S. began intensive multiplatform surveillance.

30|$|The {{variance}} ratio. Differences {{in gender}} variability were {{measured by the}} variance ratio. This ratio has been widely used by authors examining gender variability (Feingold 1992; Nowell and Hedges 1998). The variance ratio expresses the variance of males in relation to that of females. A variance ratio greater than 1 means that males’ variance is higher than females’ variance. A mean variance ratio has been computed for each study (each country being equal to one). For each study, we computed also (1) the proportion <b>of</b> participating countries <b>where</b> <b>the</b> variance ratio is significantly greater than 1 (proportion <b>of</b> countries <b>where</b> <b>the</b> variance is significantly greater for males); (2) <b>the</b> proportion <b>of</b> countries <b>where</b> <b>the</b> variance ratio is greater than 1, but not significantly; (3) <b>the</b> proportion <b>of</b> countries <b>where</b> <b>the</b> variance ratio is lower than 1, but not significantly, and (4) <b>the</b> proportion <b>of</b> countries <b>where</b> <b>the</b> variance ratio is significantly lower than 1 (variance significantly greater for females).|$|R
5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been {{deposited}} on top of a layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> rest of her body had been buried.|$|E
5|$|Colton, the Clerk of the Court and {{preparer}} of the writs {{and process}} of the court, had set the first session of county court {{to be held at}} his home, in Coltonville. In his attempt to make Coltonville the county seat, Colton decided to hold a new election for the status. Colton made sure that Coltonville would win the election by telling only the population of Coltonville about it. His political tactics were eventually cancelled by an act of the Illinois General Assembly, after the DeKalb County court intervened. When court convened the sheriff served a court order declaring a courthouse be built in Sycamore. Afterward, Coltonville eventually suffered the same fate as Brush Point and disappeared from the map. These events seemingly settled the issue <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> courthouse and, in turn, the DeKalb County seat was going to be located.|$|E
5|$|Continued {{weakened}} led to {{the storm}} being downgraded to a severe tropical storm early on February11 as it tracked towards the southeast. After spending several hours over cold waters, most of the convection associated with Hondo dissipated {{due to the lack}} of energy and the storm was further downgraded to a moderate tropical storm. Later that day, no convection remained around the storm as it weakened to a tropical depression. The JTWC issued their final advisory on February12 as the storm showed no signs of convective activity. Hondo degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area as Météo-France issued their final advisory at 1200UTC. For the next week, the remnant low traveled in a general west-northwestward direction with little or no development. On February20, about 2,780km (1,725mi) northeast <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> final advisories were issued, the low began to develop weak convection around the northern edge of the center of circulation.|$|E

5|$|Continuing south-southwest, {{the river}} {{along with the}} parkway and trailway enter Hastings-on-Hudson, its {{greenbelt}} the only major break in the village's dense suburban development. It slowly veers toward a more southerly heading, and enters the Nepera Park neighborhood of Yonkers after one mile (1.6km), just south of Farragut Parkway. Once in the neighborhood, the Saw Mill River flows through a Yonkers sewage treatment plant, the other impoundment of the river. After leaving the plant, 1.5 miles (2km) to the south <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> river entered Yonkers, the parkway and trailway diverge from the river after , to climb over the watershed divide to Tibbetts Brook. Saw Mill River Road continues to parallel its namesake.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in Jerusalem, Umar {{was led by}} Sophronius to various holy sites, {{including}} the Temple Mount. Seeing the poor state <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Temple once stood, Umar ordered the area cleared of refuse and debris before having a wooden mosque built on the site. The earliest account of such a structure is given by the Gallic bishop Arculf, who visited Jerusalem between 679 and 682, and describes a very primitive house of prayer able to accommodate up to 3,000 worshippers, constructed of wooden beams and boards over pre-existing ruins.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of September16, a reconnaissance plane recorded flight-level winds of 185km/h (115mph). Around this time, surface winds were estimated to be the same, making Helen a Category3 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Later that day, the storm made landfall near Cape Kushimoto. In Shionomisaki Lighthouse, just west <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> center of Helen passed, a barometric pressure of 955mbar (hPa; 28.26inHg) was recorded, the lowest {{in relation to the}} storm. As the system neared Hokkaido, it slowed down and began a multi-day anticyclonic loop. During this period, it merged with an upper-level low and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September19. The remnants of Helen then tracked across southern Hokkaido before dissipating just east of the island on September21.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, another AMNH {{expedition}} led by Brown {{discovered an}} Ankylosaurus specimen (AMNH 5214) in the Scollard Formation by the Red Deer River in Alberta, Canada. This specimen included a complete skull, mandibles, {{the first and}} only tail club known of this genus, as well as ribs, vertebrae, limb bones, and armor. In 1947, fossil collectors Charles M. Sternberg and T.P. Channey collected a skull and mandible (specimen CMN 8880, formerly NMC 8880), a kilometre (0.6 miles) north <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> 1910 specimen was found. This is the largest known Ankylosaurus skull, but is badly preserved. A section of caudal vertebrae (specimen CCM V03) was discovered in the 1960s, in the Powder River drainage, Montana, also part of the Hell Creek Formation. In addition to these five incomplete specimens, many other isolated osteoderms and teeth have been found.|$|E
