These data reveal that the wavelengths and intensities of the patterns vary systematically across this region, but that these parameters are not strictly determined by the ring’s average optical depth.

Selecting colonial opacity variants of similar size, we identified opaque and transparent stable variants. Opaque colony-derived broth cultures shed transparent colonies {{at a rate of}} about 1. 2 X 10 (- 8) per CFU per generation. The reverse conversion was about two orders of magnitude less frequent. Appearance of opacity and plating efficiency of each pure culture were altered by changing the serum source used to supplement the growth medium. Horse or sheep serum was most efficient at accentuating visualization of opacity differences. Fetal bovine serum was least efficient. In two M. pulmonis strains, each opacity variant showed a distinctive polypeptide profile, as displayed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the same strains, distinctive intrastrain differences were found by agarose gel electrophoresis to display the DNA fragments produced after digestion by several endonucleases. Each pure culture variant retained these differences in DNA even when grown in a medium supplemented with a serum which did not accentuate visualization of the opacity phenotype.

40|$|Publisher's PDFThe {{detection}} by Rest et al. {{of light}} echoes from η Carinae has provided important new observational {{constraints on the}} nature of its 1840 s era giant eruption. Spectra of the echoes suggest a relatively cool spectral temperature of about 5500 K, lower than the lower limit of about 7000 K suggested in the optically thick wind-outflow analysis of Davidson. This has led to a debate about the viability of this steady wind model relative to alternative, explosive scenarios. Here we present an updated analysis of the wind-outflow model using newer low- temperature opacity tabulations and accounting for the stronger mass-loss implied by the > 10 M mass now inferred for the Homunculus. A major conclusion is that, because of the sharp drop in opacity due to recombination loss of free electrons for T < 6500 K, a low temperature of about 5000 K is compatible with, and indeed expected from, a wind with the extreme mass-loss inferred for the eruption. Within a spherical grey model in radiative equilibrium, we derive spectral energy distributions for various assumptions for the <b>opacity</b> <b>variation</b> of the wind, providing a basis for comparisons with observed light echo spectra. The scaling results here are also potentially relevant for other highly optically thick outflows, including those from classical novae, giant eruptions of luminous blue variables and supernovae Type IIn precursors. A broader issue therefore remains whether the complex, variable features observed from such eruptions are better understood in terms of a steady or explosive paradigm, or perhaps a balance of these idealizations.

In three epochs, over a 1. 7 yr interval, we find evidence for significant <b>opacity</b> <b>variations</b> toward all of the pulsars in our sample. Small-scale structure in the ISM is detected on a range of scales from 5 AU to 100 AU, over a wide range of distances (50 - 2600 pc), opacities (tau(sub max) = 0. 1 - 2. 5) and directions (anticenter, interarm, high latitude, and local ISM). It appears that small-scale structure is a general property of the ISM and is not confined to special lines of sight. A significant fraction (10 %- 15 %) of the cold H I gas is in this form.

The observed variations cannot be explained by simple inter-stellar scintillation (ISS) models where there are {{only one or two}} scintillating components and all of the ISS occurs in the Galaxy. More complicated models where there are either more scintillating components or some of the ISS occurs in the ISM of the z= 0. 3127 absorber may be acceptable. However, the variability can probably best be explained in models incorporating motion (on sub-VLBI scales) of a component of the background continuum source, with or without some ISS.

40|$|Colony opacity {{variants}} {{were detected}} for type III group B streptococci (GBS). Transparent colonies predominate in the parent GBS, with occasional colonies having opaque portions. Two stable opaque variants (1. 1 and 1. 5) {{were compared with}} three transparent clones (1. 2, 1. 3, and 1. 4). All grew well on blood agar and on GC medium, but variant 1. 1 failed to grow on Todd-Hewitt medium. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that colony opacity correlated with bacterial aggregation status, with opaque variants forming longer and more organized chains. Opaque-transparent switches were observed in both directions for most variants, with transparent to opaque noted most frequently, but 1. 5 did not switch at all. Switching of the opacity phenotype was observed both in vitro and in neonatal mice. Relationships between colony opacity and several cell surface phenomena were explored. (i) Opaque variant 1. 1 had two surface proteins (46 and 75 kDa) that were either unique or greatly overexpressed. (ii) Variant 1. 1 was deficient in type III polysaccharide, while 1. 5 lacked group B antigen. Diminished capsular polysaccharide of variant 1. 1 was reflected in reduced negative electrophoretic mobility and in increased buoyant density. (iii) Transparent variant colonies growing closest to a penicillin disk were opaque, but colonial variants {{did not differ in}} their sensitivity to penicillin. These data indicate that GBS can exist in both opaque and transparent forms, with opaque appearance occurring by multiple routes. Opaque variants grow poorly on Todd-Hewitt medium generally used for isolation of GBS, so any possible relationships between <b>opacity</b> <b>variation</b> and pathogenesis of GBS infection are unknown...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} 3. 5 -yr {{monitoring}} results of 225 GHz opacity {{at the summit}} of the Greenland ice sheet (Greenland Summit Camp) at an altitude of 3200 m using a tipping radiometer. We chose this site as our submillimeter telescope (Greenland Telescope; GLT) site, because its location offers favorable baselines to existing submillimeter telescopes for global-scale VLBI. The site shows a clear seasonal variation with the average opacity lower by a factor of two during winter. For the winter quartiles of 25 % and 50 %, the Greenland site is about 10 %- 30 % worse than the ALMA or the South Pole sites. Estimated atmospheric transmission spectra in winter season are similar to the ALMA site at lower frequencies ( 450 GHz) than those at the ALMA site. This is due to the lower altitude of the Greenland site. Nevertheless, half of the winter time at the Greenland site can be used for astronomical observations at frequencies between 450 GHz and 1000 GHz with opacities 10 % transmittance in the THz (1035 GHz, 1350 GHz, and 1500 GHz) windows. One major advantage of the Greenland site in winter {{is that there is no}} diurnal variation due to the polar night condition, and therefore the durations of low-opacity conditions are significantly longer than at the ALMA site. Opacities lower than 0. 05 or 0. 04 can continue for more than 100 hours. Such long stable opacity conditions do not occur as often even at the South Pole; it happens only for the opacity lower than 0. 05. Since the <b>opacity</b> <b>variation</b> is directly related to the sky temperature (background) variation, the Greenland site is suitable for astronomical observations that need unusually stable sky background.

However, traditional, opaque, square, crystalline-silicon solar cells contrast strongly with their surroundings when incorporated into translucent, coloured glazing. Methods of blending photovoltaic cells into their surroundings were developed, using traditional glass painting techniques. A design was created in which opaque paint was applied to the areas of glass around underlying photovoltaic cells. Translucent, platinum paint was used on the glass behind the photovoltaic cells. This covered the grey cell backs whilst reflecting light and movement. The platinum paint was shown to cause a slight increase in power produced by photovoltaic cells placed above it. To add colour, very small amounts of Lumogen F dye (BASF) were incorporated into a silicone encapsulant (Dow Corning, Sylgard 184), which was then used hold photovoltaic cells in place between sheets of painted glass. Lumogen dyes selectively absorb and emit light, giving a good balance between colour addition and electricity production from underlying photovoltaic cells. When making sufficient quantities of dyed encapsulant for a 600 x 450 mm test piece, the brightness of the dye colours faded, and fluorescence decreased, although some colour was retained. Improvement of the method, including testing of alternative encapsulant materials, is required, to ensure that the dyes continue to fluoresce within the encapsulant. In contrast, the methods of adding <b>opacity</b> <b>variation</b> to glass, through use of glass painting, are straightforward to develop for use {{in a wide variety of}} photovoltaic installations.

Colony opacity {{is a function}} of chain length, with opaque colonies consisting of GBS that form longer chains. Because opaque variants do not grow on standard streptococcal media, the role of <b>opacity</b> <b>variation</b> in GBS infection has not been studied. We have isolated stable variants from type III GBS that are either transparent (variants 1. 2 and 1. 3) or opaque (variants 1. 1 and 1. 5). In this study, we evaluated the interactions of these variants with different components of the host immune system both in vitro and in vivo. Opaque GBS were less immunogenic than transparent GBS. Opaque GBS were more susceptible to killing by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and could induce a chemiluminescent response of PMNs in the absence of antibody (Ab) or complement. Transparent GBS did not induce neutrophil chemiluminescence in the absence of Ab and complement. However, in the presence of Ab and complement, transparent GBS induced a stronger chemiluminescent response than did opaque GBS. Scanning electron micrographs of PMNs and GBS demonstrated differences in the attachment and engulfment of the different variants by the PMNs as well as different effects of the GBS on the PMNs themselves. Interactions with complement were affected by GBS opacity as well, with opaque variant 1. 1 initiating complement activation {{in the absence of any}} Ab. The virulence of the GBS opacity variants was studied in vivo by inoculation of graded numbers of GBS into newborn mice. Transparent variants 1. 2 and 1. 3 were most virulent, with variant 1. 1 intermediate and variant 1. 5 minimally virulent. However, in mixed infections, variant 1. 5 greatly enhanced the virulence of small numbers of transparent GBS.

40|$|Motivated by the claimed {{detection}} {{of a large}} population of faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshift, recent studies have proposed models in which AGN contribute significantly to the z > 4 H I ionizing background. In some models, AGN are even the chief sources of reionization. If correct, these models would make necessary a complete revision to the standard view that galaxies dominated the high-redshift ionizing background. It {{has been suggested that}} AGN-dominated models can better account for two recent observations that appear to be in conflict with the standard view: (1) large <b>opacity</b> <b>variations</b> in the z ~ 5. 5 H I Lyman-alpha forest, and (2) slow evolution in the mean opacity of the He II Lyman-alpha forest. Large spatial fluctuations in the ionizing background from the brightness and rarity of AGN may account for the former, while the earlier onset of He II reionization in these models may account for the latter. Here we show that models in which AGN emissions source >~ 50 % of the ionizing background generally provide a better fit to the observed H I Lyman-alpha forest <b>opacity</b> <b>variations</b> compared to standard galaxy-dominated models. However, we argue that these AGN-dominated models are in tension with constraints on the thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Under standard assumptions about the spectra of AGN, we show that the earlier onset of He II reionization heats up the IGM well above recent temperature measurements. We further argue that the slower evolution of the mean opacity of the He II Lyman-alpha forest relative to simulations may reflect deficiencies in current simulations rather than favor AGN-dominated models as has been suggested.

40|$|The cloud {{structure}} of the jovian atmosphere at pressures less than 2 bars has previously been estimated using near-infrared observations such as those by both the Solid State Imager (SSI) and Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) instruments on board the Galileo spacecraft. Unfortunately, complete near-infrared spectra, such as those measured by NIMS, {{take a long time}} to be analyzed with multiple-scattering radiative transfer models and thus it has until now been rather difficult to use these data to produce wide-area cloud maps. In this paper we show how principal component analysis may be employed to isolate a small number of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) from spectra of Jupiter made by Galileo/NIMS. These EOFs may be used to represent the variance of real NIMS spectra to a high degree of accuracy and with good noise and "drop-out" discrimination. Because of this, a small set of representative spectra may then be calculated using these EOFs and input into a retrieval model that generates a table of fitted cloud profiles for each case. This approach avoids the long times required for analyzing a large number of spectra with full multiple-scattering radiative transfer models and allows us to represent the variability of the 3000 spectra contained in the observations of the North Equatorial Belt (NEB) used in this study with only 75 representative spectra. The cloud structures fitted to these representative spectra were interpolated for the spectra found at individual locations in the measured NIMS data set to produce maps of cloud opacity and mean particle size. We find that the dominant <b>opacity</b> <b>variation,</b> anticorrelated with 5 -μm brightness, exists in the 1 - 2 bar pressure range.

40|$|The {{eclipsing binary}} Theta 1 Orionis B 1, {{variable}} star designation BM Ori, is the faintest {{of the four}} well-known Trapezium stars {{at the heart of}} the Orion Nebula. The primary is a B 3 star (~ 6 Msun) but the nature of the secondary (~ 2 Msun) has long been mysterious, since the duration and shape of primary eclipse are inappropriate for ordinary stars. Here we report nearly continuous photometric observations obtained with the MOST satellite over ~ 4 cycles of the 6. 47 d binary period. The light curve is of unprecedented quality, revealing a deep, symmetric primary eclipse as well as a clear reflection effect and secondary eclipse. In addition, there are other small disturbances, some of which repeat at the same phase over the four cycles monitored. The shape of the primary light curve has clearly evolved significantly over the past 40 yr. While its overall duration and depth have remained roughly constant, the slopes of the descent and ascent phases are significantly shallower now than in the past and its distinctive flat-bottomed "pseudo-totality" is much less obvious or even absent in the most recent data. We further demonstrate that the primary eclipse was detected at X-ray wavelengths during the Chandra COUP study. The light curve continues to be well modeled by a self-luminous and reflective disk-shaped object seen nearly edge-on orbiting the primary. The dramatic change in shape over four decades is modeled as an <b>opacity</b> <b>variation</b> in a tenuous outer envelope or disk of the secondary object. We presume that the secondary is an extremely young protostar at an earlier evolutionary phase than can be commonly observed elsewhere in the Galaxy and that the opacity variations observed are related to its digestion of some accreted matter over the last 50 - 100 yr. Indeed, this object deserves continued observational and theoretical attention as the youngest known eclipsing binary system...|$|E

D. thesis, University of Oxford) have been combined with existing, longer path-length, higher-temperature data of Strong et al. (1993, Spectral parameters of self- and hydrogen-broadened methane from 2000 to 9500 cm - 1 for remote sounding of the atmosphere of Jupiter, J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Trans. 50, 309 – 325) and fitted with band models. The combined data set {{is found to be}} more consistent with previous low-temperature methane absorption measurements than that of Strong et al. (1993, J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Trans. 50, 309 – 325) but covers the same wider wavelength range and accounts for both self- and hydrogen-broadening conditions. These data have been fitted with k- coefficients in the manner described by Irwin et al. (1996, Calculated k- distribution coefficients for hydrogen- and self-broadened methane in the range 2000 – 9500 cm - 1 from exponential sum fitting to band modelled spectra, J. Geophys. Res. 101, 26, 137 – 26, 154) and have been used in multiple-scattering radiative transfer models to assess their impact on our previous estimates of the jovian cloud structure obtained from Galileo Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) observations (Irwin et al., 1998, Cloud structure and atmospheric composition of Jupiter retrieved from Galileo NIMS real-time spectra, J. Geophys. Res. 103, 23, 001 – 23, 021; Irwin et al., 2001, The origin of belt/zone contrasts in the atmosphere of Jupiter and their correlation with 5 -μm opacity, Icarus 149, 397 – 415; Irwin and Dyudina, 2002, The retrieval of cloud structure maps in the equatorial region of Jupiter using a principal component analysis of Galileo/NIMS data, Icarus 156, 52 – 63). Although significant differences in methane opacity are found at cooler temperatures, the difference in the optical depth of the atmosphere due to methane is found to diminish rapidly with increasing pressure and temperature and thus has negligible effect on the cloud structure inferred at deeper levels. Hence the main cloud <b>opacity</b> <b>variation</b> is still found to peak at around 1 – 2 bar using our previous analytical approach, and is thus still in disagreement with Galileo Solid State Imager (SSI) determinations (Banfield et al., 1998, Jupiter's cloud structure from Galileo imaging data, Icarus 135, 230 – 250; Simon-Miller et al., 2001, Color and the vertical structure in Jupiter's belts, zones and weather systems, Icarus 154, 459 – 474) which place the main cloud deck near 0. 9 bar. Further analysis of our retrievals reveals that this discrepancy is probably due to the different assumptions of the two analyses. Our retrievals use a smooth vertically extended cloud profile while the SSI determinations assume a thin NH 3 cloud below an extended haze. When the main opacity in our model is similarly assumed to be due to a thin cloud below an extended haze, we find the main level of cloud <b>opacity</b> <b>variation</b> to be near the 1 bar level—close to that determined by SSI and moderately close to the expected condensation level of ammonia ice of 0. 85 bar, assuming that the abundance of ammonia on Jupiter is (7 ± 1) × 10 − 4 (Folkner et al., 1998, Ammonia abundance in Jupiter's atmosphere derived from the attenuation of the Galileo probe's radio signal, J.

Space Sci. 47, 1243 – 1262). However our data in the 1 – 2. 5 μm range have good height discrimination and our lowest estimate of the cloud base pressure of 1 bar is still too great to be consistent with the most recent estimates of the ammonia abundance of 3. 5 × solar. Furthermore the observed limited spatial distribution of ammonia ice absorption features on Jupiter suggests that pure ammonia ice is only present in regions of localised vigorous uplift (Baines et al., 2002, Fresh ammonia ice clouds in Jupiter: spectroscopic identification, spatial distribution, and dynamical implications, Icarus 159, 74 – 94) and is subsequently rapidly modified in some way which masks its pure absorption features. Hence we conclude that the main cloud deck on Jupiter is unlikely to be composed of pure ammonia ice and instead find that it must be composed of either NH 4 SH or some other unknown combination of ammonia, water, and hydrogen sulphide and exists at pressures of between 1 and 2 bar. </p...|$|E

No such boundaries have yet been detected at the ultraviolet wavelengths. We suspect that the local dynamics must {{play a role in}} affecting the distribution of aerosols at the levels on both day- and nightsides involved for lack of any other evidence. These features serve as a caution against basing interpretations of the cloud patterns using the VIRA model (Kliore et al. 1985) since local deviations from local circulations are clearly significant. At this point, it is premature {{to assess the impact of}} these local <b>opacity</b> <b>variations</b> on the heat deposition in the atmosphere which is believed to be driving the superrotation of the deep atmosphere of Venus.|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between light and light-transmitting objects, known as participating media, involves complex physical phenomena such as light absorption and scattering. Media such as clouds, smoke and translucent materials often feature heterogeneous scattering proper-ties. Hence the radiance transmitted by the medium potentially de-pends on such varying properties {{on the entire}} light paths, yielding soft light shafts and <b>opacity</b> <b>variations</b> (Figure 1). Computing light scattering in these media usually requires com-plex offline computations [Cerezo et al. 2005]. Real-time applica-tions are either based on heavy precomputations [Zhou et al. 2008], limited to homogeneous media [Gautron et al. 2009] or relying on simplistic rendering techniques such as billboards. We propose a generic method for fast estimation of single scattering within het-erogeneous participating media.

40|$|We propose an {{algorithm}} {{to retrieve}} the global features of the spectral dependence of the ultraviolet (UV) irradiance from integrated, broadband UV measurements performed {{with a set of}} photodiodes with different UV filters. This fit, when applied to ground based measurements and compared to the incident Solar spectral irradiance {{on the top of the}} atmosphere, may be used to extract the spectral dependence of the UV opacity and the most relevant parameters characterizing the scattering with atmospheric aerosol (Angstrom exponent, etc) as well as the biological effective doses. In this way, using a set of photodiodes instead of a spectrophotometer, one may get spectral information within very low mass, package and weight constraints, which is particular useful for space missions. We consider its application for the rover-based exploration of the Martian ground which is subjected to daily and seasonal <b>opacity</b> <b>variations...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceAims. We {{observed}} the L 1506 filament, {{which is located}} in the Taurus molecular complex, with the Herschel PACS and SPIRE instruments. Our aim is to prove the variation in grain properties along {{the entire length of the}} filament. In particular, we want to determine above which gas density this variation arises and what changes in the grain optical properties/size distribution are required. Methods. We use the 3 D radiative transfer code CRT, coupled to the dust emission and extinction code DustEM, to model the emission and extinction of the dense filament. We test a range of optical properties and size distributions for the grains: dust of the diffuse interstellar medium (interstellar PAHs and amorphous carbons and silicates) and both compact and fluffy aggregates. Results. We find that the grain opacity has to increase across the filament to fit simultaneously the near-IR extinction and Herschel emission profiles of L 1506. We interpret this change to be a consequence of the coagulation of dust grains to form fluffy aggregates. Grains similar to those in the diffuse medium have to be present in the outer layers of the cloud, whereas aggregates must prevail above gas densities of a few 103 H/cm 3. This corresponds to line-of-sights with visual extinction in the V band of the order of 2 to 3. The dust opacity at 250 μm is raised by a factor of 1. 8 to 2. 2, while the grain average size is increased by a factor of 5. These exact numbers depend naturally on the dust model chosen to fit the data. Our findings agree with the constraints given by the study of the gas molecular lines. Using a simple approach, we show that the aggregates may have time to form inside the filament within the cloud lifetime. Our model also characterises the density structure of the filament, showing that the filament width is not constant along L 1506 but instead varies by a factor of the order of 4. Conclusions. We confirm the need for an increase in the far-IR dust opacity to explain the emission and extinction in L 1506 C, which we interpret as being due to dust growth. We also show that this <b>opacity</b> <b>variation</b> is valid along the entire length of the L 1506 dense filament...|$|E
40|$|International audienceContext. Radiative {{transfer}} plays a {{major role}} in the process of star formation, the details of which are still not entirely understood. Aims: Many previous simulations of gravitational collapse of a cold gas cloud followed by the formation of a protostellar core have used a grey treatment of radiative transfer coupled to the hydrodynamics. However, the dust opacities that dominate circumstellar extinction show strong variations as a function of frequency. In this paper, we used a frequency-dependent formalism for the radiative transfer to investigate the influence of the <b>opacity</b> <b>variations</b> on the properties of Larson's first core. Methods: We used a multigroup M 1 moment model for the radiative transfer in a 1 D Lagrangean Godunov radiation hydrodynamics code to simulate the spherically symmetric collapse of a 1 M&sun; cold cloud core. Monochromatic dust opacities for five different temperature ranges were used to compute Planck and Rosseland means inside each frequency group. Results: The results are very consistent with previous studies and only small differences were observed between the grey and multigroup simulations. For a same central density, the multigroup simulations tend to produce first cores with a slightly higher radius and central temperature. We also performed simulations of the collapse of a 10 and 0. 1 M&sun; cloud, which showed that the properties of the first core (size, mass, entropy, etc.) are independent of the initial cloud mass, with again no major differences between grey and multigroup models. Conclusions: For Larson's first collapse, where temperatures remain below 2000 K, the vast majority of the radiation energy lies in the infrared regime and the system is optically thick. In this regime, the grey approximation satisfactorily reproduces the correct opacities, as long as there are no strong <b>opacity</b> <b>variations</b> on scales much smaller than the width of the Planck function. However, the multigroup method is expected to yield additional more important differences in the later stages of the collapse when high-energy (UV and X-ray) radiation is present and matter and radiation are strongly decoupled...|$|R

40|$|Temperature {{contrasts}} {{and magnetic}} field strengths of sunspot umbrae broadly follow the thermal-magnetic relationship obtained from magnetohydrostatic equilibrium. Using {{a compilation of}} recent observations, especially in molecular bands, of temperature contrasts of starspots in cool stars, and a grid of Kurucz stellar model atmospheres constructed to cover layers of sub-surface convection zone, we examine how the above relationship scales with effective temperature T_{eff}, surface gravity g and the associated changes in opacity of stellar photospheric gas.

40|$|Visibility culling has the {{potential}} to accelerate large data visualization in significant ways. Unfortunately, existing algorithms do not scale well when parallelized, and require full re-computation whenever the opacity transfer function is modified. To address these issues, we have designed a Plenoptic Opacity Function (POF) scheme to encode the view-dependent opacity of a volume block. POFs are computed off-line during a pre-processing stage, only once for each block. We show that using POFs is (i) an efficient, conservative and effective way to encode the <b>opacity</b> <b>variations</b> of a volume block for a range of views, (ii) flexible for re-use by a family of opacity transfer functions without the need for additional off-line processing, and (iii) highly scalable for use in massively parallel implementations.
