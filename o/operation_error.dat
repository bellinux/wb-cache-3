40|$|The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) has {{successfully}} operated an in-house developed powerline fault locator system since 1986. The BPA fault locator system consists of remotes installed at cardinal {{power transmission line}} system nodes and a central master which polls the remotes for traveling wave time-of-arrival data. A power line fault produces a fast rise-time traveling wave which emanates from the fault point and propagates throughout the power grid. The remotes time-tag the traveling wave leading edge as it passes through the power system cardinal substation nodes. A synchronizing pulse transmitted via the BPA analog microwave system on a wideband channel sychronizes the time-tagging counters in the remote units to a different accuracy of better than one microsecond. The remote units correct the raw time tags for synchronizing pulse propagation delay and return these corrected values to the fault locator master.

30|$|The mixed-pixel {{fraction}} is {{a function}} of not only the length but also the width of MPZs (Fig.  11). In images, the width of edges between two different objects (i.e. the MPZ width in the present study) decreases with the increase of image sharpness (Allen and Triantaphillidou 2011; Smith 1997) (Fig.  11). As mentioned in the introduction, even with optically-perfect lens, MPZs are at least as wide as one pixel due to the grid pixel system of digital images (Fisher 1997). Because image resolution of the image capturing devices in many up-to-date digital cameras exceeds that of lens ([URL] 20 th April, 2017), blurred SCBs caused by lens imperfections are recorded in details, resulting in that MPZs are even wider. In addition, image sharpness is also influenced by the image-processing algorithms of camera firmware and <b>operation</b> <b>errors</b> during image acquisition (Allen and Triantaphillidou 2011) (Fig.  11).
