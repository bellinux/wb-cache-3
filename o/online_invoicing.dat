Electronic {{invoicing}} allows vendors to submit invoices over the internet and have those invoices automatically routed and processed. Because invoice arrival and presentation is almost immediate invoices are paid sooner; therefore, the amount of time and money it takes to process these invoices is greatly reduced. (Financial Operations Networks, 2008) These solutions usually involve a third party company that provides and supports an application which allows a supplier to submit an electronic invoice to their customer for immediate routing, approval, and payment. These applications are tied to databases which archive transaction information between trading partners. (US Bank, Scott Hesse, 2010) The invoices may be submitted in a number of ways, including EDI, CSV, or XML uploads. PDF files, or <b>online</b> <b>invoice</b> templates. Because E-invoicing includes so many different technologies and entry options, it is used as an umbrella term to describe any method by which an invoice is electronically presented to a customer for payment.|$|R

The secondary objectives {{can be defined as}} methods of using the database and the identification of the database user. The thesis has been prepared based on my own experience. The first part of the thesis introduces the systems using the database; this does not refer to any specific applications but only to generally defined systems for which the thesis outlines a potential use for the database. The second part deals with the possibilities offered by the database for specific persons who come in contact with this database. The third part describes a conceptual data model, explaining all its entities and relationships and clarifying the use of integrity constraints. The fourth part introduces another integrity constraint and analyses a database adjustment for RDBMS Oracle Database Express Edition 10 g, in which the functionality of the database was tested. The last part proposes security measures and defines access authorizations for tables, introduces created views limiting the volume of data visible for users, and stored procedures serving to automate certain activities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a security problem involving an online data repository which {{acts as a}} proxy for multiple companies allowing their customers to perform online services (e. g., pay invoices). The repository’s host is trusted to honestly fulfil its duties in maintaining the data {{in a manner consistent with}} each companies’ required services. However, the information stored by the repository remains private in that the repository’s host cannot openly read any companies’ operational data, nor does it learn the identities of any companies’ customers. We contrast several approaches describing their viability for web deployment using existing technologies. This is a fundamentally new security problem with no established literature or clearly defined cryptographic solution. The project originated from a commercial attempt to design a secure online data archive that allows a customer to pay and view <b>invoices</b> <b>online...</b>|$|R

Numerous definitions of e-services generalize their essence, reflect the specific characteristics and certain elements of their production process. They are important for economic theory and practice, {{but none of them}} have acquired general acceptance. Supranational institutions, scientists and researchers attempt to seek one definition. A lot of definitions explain e-services only as e-government, e-learning and e-commerce. It is insufficient for further classification. We pay attention to classification of e-services in this chapter. Some of them divided e-services according to the branch, processes etc. Classification as e-co model, e-ladder, E-Diamond model, classification of service and product to the dimensions in a 2 * 2 matrix, and fulfilment-product classification have been introduced. The main goal of our study is to provide an extensive review of e-service definitions and classifications. Based on the findings we propose our own classification of e-services. The result of our work is a new 3 D model. The 3 D model is constructed according to bases of stages models and Diamond model, but we respect also user's needs and their fulfilment in process. In this empirical analysis of e-service definitions and classifications, we have compared known definitions and classifications and proposed a new model. Most models and schemes only deal with public e-services. We bring a new perspective, the classification is intended for all known e-services...|$|R

In order to increase tax revenue, the government did tax reform. First, the government changed the system of taxation Official Assessment System (OAS) into a Self Assessment System (SAS) however, these efforts have not been optimal because SAS instead increases tax compliance costs. In the next tax reform, the government build a modern tax administration system one of which is the e-invoice. A tax <b>invoice</b> <b>online</b> application maker to lower the cost of VAT compliance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to: 1) find changes in tax compliance costs component based on descriptions of voting procedures to reporting VAT return period before and after e-invoicing; 2) describe the role of e-invoice in changing compliance costs suffered by the taxpayer; 3) know the amount difference of VAT tax compliance costs before and after e-invoice. Qualitative approach case study method was used to answer the objectives 1 and 2, then the objective 3 was answered by comparing and perform Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test of amount tax compliance costs. The results showed that the adoption of e-invoicing eliminates direct costs such as the costs to buy or print the invoice taxes form and lowering the cost of time to invoicing and filling the VAT return. Implementation of e-invoice first make taxpayers bear big time cost to understand and learn the e-invoice. The majority of taxpayers key persons feel that the e-invoice does not reduce the cost of compliance. Based on the results of different test-Wilcoxon Signed Ranks there is no significant difference between the cost of tax compliance in the six months before and after the e-invoice is used. However, there are significant differences between the estimated total cost of tax compliance in one year before and one year after the e-invoice.

It {{is one of the}} web-based systems that used in university for any financial transactions among staffs and students. Various types of university online financial systems are able to set the tuition fees, financial statement, invoices and make payment. The UTM online finance system is one of the financial portals that promise a new, convenient and safe finance environment. It attends to financing needs, along with providing a simple <b>online</b> system for <b>Invoice,</b> balance and payment. The current UTM online finance system has some drawbacks such as the system is not able to send any email notification to the student when a new invoice is issued, students are not able to check their financial statements, refund, payment, student financial status and invoices in details, the staff issues manual receipt of the payment that the student made and if the students have a problem they need to go manually to the finance department to solve their problem. Furthermore, the current system does not have online payment by visa card. The methodology used in this project is a waterfall model methodology which is a series of phases which are planning, requirements analysis, system design implementation and testing. According to the explained drawbacks for the current system, this project proposes new features solve the problems in current online UTM student finance system such as making online payments, sending an email to the student whenever a new invoice is issued. Furthermore, issuing electronic receipts for the payments that are made by the students, communicating with staff by sending messages, uploading student’s payment transfer fund or payment receipt and keeping and tracing the receipt.
