5|$|The {{levelized cost}} <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> (LCoE) can be {{calculated}} by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by the total amount <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> shipped to the grid during that period. The amount of money is essentially {{a combination of the}} capital expense (CAPEX) of the plant and the interest payments on that CAPEX, and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted operational expenses, or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated by considering the peak power the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the capacity factor (CF) to account for downtime due to maintenance or deliberate throttling. As a quick calculation, one can ignore inflation, opportunity costs and minor operational expenses to develop a figure of merit for the cost <b>of</b> <b>electricity.</b>|$|E

5|$|All {{editions of}} the book were being printed in Europe until 1941, when the first {{publication}} of {{it was done in}} the United States by I. Bernard Cohen. The book is Franklin's only scientific work, and is recognized by historians Gary F. Kurutz and Dennis Smith as America's most important scientific book of the eighteenth century. The publication for his scientific observations on electricity made Franklin famous throughout Europe as a serious scientist. Eighteenth-century British polymath Joseph Priestley writes in his book The History and Present State <b>of</b> <b>Electricity</b> (1767) that nobody had written an in-depth study <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> with the use of scientific experimentation like this of Franklin's that had been translated into most European languages in the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|DST's {{potential}} {{to save energy}} comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> in the United States and Canada. Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light {{in the evening and}} increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use <b>of</b> <b>electricity.</b> Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, making it hard to generalize from single studies.|$|E
