40|$|Maslinic and oleanolic acids are triterpenic acids (TA) widely {{distributed}} in the vegetable kingdom that raise a great interest because of their biological properties. They have shown anti-inflammatory and cardio-protective activities and also antioxidant and antitumor properties. Located in the skin of olives they are transferred to virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> constituting minor oil components and being significantly more concentrated in the latter. During storage of <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> {{a great variety of}} compounds are released through fermentative and hydrolytic mechanisms and TA are not an exception. In order to obtain edible <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> <b>oils</b> concentrated in these valuable components our research group has recently patented a technological strategy based upon extraction of the oil by centrifugation followed by physical refining (US 2011 / 0189320 A 1). The solubility of TA in the oil is quite limited. They are mainly present as solid particles in the crude oil and, therefore, TA can be obtained by filtration. Also in the patent above, we describe a simple procedure to obtain the concentrates, which consists in an extraction of the filtration cake with hexane to remove the remaining oil followed by extraction with ethanol. In this study we characterize extracts obtained from oils of 2013 / 2014 season and examine their antioxidant activity by using radical scavenging measures (DPPH and ABTS) and the ferric reducing power (FRAP) test. For comparative purposes, extracts from regular <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> extracted with hexane were also evaluated. The results obtained showed contents of oleanolic and maslinic acids of more than 50 wt%, presenting maslinic acid a concentration that was twice as much larger than oleanolic acid.

40|$|Background and Objectives: A {{method was}} {{developed}} and validated for determining 15 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in refined <b>olive</b> and refined <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a fluorescence detector. Materials and Methods: The sample preparation involved liquid–liquid extraction with organic solvent and low temperature clean-up. The low temperature allowed most of the lipids in the extract to be removed. Then alumina-N and NH 2 solid phase extraction cartridges were used for further clean-up. Results: The {{results showed that the}} obtained chromatogram of extract was free of significant interferences. The PAH recoveries ranged from 81 % to 114 %. Limit of detection and limit of quantitation for individual PAHs were 0. 09 - 1. 97 µgkg- 1 and 0. 29 - 5. 99 µgkg- 1, respectively.

40|$|<b>Olive</b> <b>pomace</b> <b>oil</b> is a {{by-product}} from {{the olive oil}} industry that is still {{being used in the}} food industry as a low value vegetable oil. Crude <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> <b>oil</b> needs to be refined and is blended with virgin olive oils before being used as edible oil. The detection of toxic compounds led to more restricted legislation and to the search of alternative valorisation processes, such as hydrotreating to obtain bio-hydrocarbons. Hydrotreating of <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> <b>oil</b> at moderate temperatures (from 300 to 430 C) and in presence of initial hydrogen pressure of 1. 1 MPa led to triglycerides destruction and to their conversion into a large range of organic compounds with predominance to hydrocarbons. Even without any catalyst, conversions into hydrocarbons were always higher than 90 % (v/v). Catalyst presence, such as: CoMo/Al 2 O 3, FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) or HZSM- 5 changed hydrogenated liquids composition. The highest content of alkanes was obtained with CoMo catalyst, while FCC and HZSM- 5 led to the highest contents of aromatic compounds.

This paper describes a decision model whose objective function seeks to maximise the quantity of <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> <b>oil</b> by improving the efficiency of mechanical extraction at OWMC. To improve this efficiency, a husk management decision model has been developed to cope with nonlinear husk pooling relationships over a multistage period. The convergence difficulties of mixed integer nonlinear optimisation in the decision model are dealt with by means of a novel multistage iterative linear formulation based on the first order Taylor approximation. The output accuracy and convergence of the proposed model is compared with that of a relaxed mixed integer nonlinear optimisation model.

The nonglyceride matter of this oil is {{a good source of}} interesting minor compounds, like long-chain fatty alcohols, which are present free or as part of waxes. In the present study, long-chain fatty alcohols were isolated from the nonglyceride fraction of <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> and the composition was identified and quantified. The major components of long-chain fatty alcohols were tetracosanol, hexacosanol and octacosanol. We investigated the ability of long-chain fatty alcohols from <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> to inhibit the release of different proinflammatory mediators in vitro by cells involved in inflammatory processes. Long-chain fatty alcohols significantly and dose-dependently decreased nitric oxide production by RAW 264. 7 murine macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Western blot analysis showed that nitric oxide reduction was a consequence of the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthetase expression. Long-chain fatty alcohols also reduced tumor necrosis factor-α and prostaglandin E 2 production, although the potency of inhibition for the latter was lower. On the other hand, long-chain fatty alcohols significantly reduced thromboxane A 2 production in rat peritoneal neutrophils stimulated with the calcium ionophore A- 23187. The reduction of eicosanoid release was related to the inhibition of phospholipase A 2 enzyme activity by long-chain fatty alcohols, reaching an inhibitory concentration 50 % value of 6. 2 μg/ml.

Our aim was to evaluate the effects of long-term intake of diets enriched in POM with high concentration in oleanolic acid on endothelial dysfunction associated to hypertension in small mesenteric arteries (SMA) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). During 12 weeks, rats (six rats per group) were fed either a control 2 % maize oil diet (BD), or high-fat diets containing 15 % refined <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (OL), <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (POM), or <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> supplemented in oleanolic acid (POMO; up to 800 parts per million). Endothelial and vascular functions were assessed by relaxing or contracting responses to acetylcholine (ACh) or phenylephrine, respectively. The involvement of endothelium-derived relaxing factors in these responses was evaluated. In contrast to BD, SHR fed high-fat diets showed a biphasic response to ACh related to changes in eicosanoid metabolism. POM enhanced the endothelial function in SMA from SHR by increasing the endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factor (EDHF) -type component, whereas administration of POMO resulted in a similar contribution of NO/EDHF in the endothelial response to ACh. The present study shows that despite the lack of changes in blood pressure, consumption of POM improves endothelial function in SMA from SHR by improving the agonist-mediated EDHF/NO response. Thus, triterpenoids confer a protective role to POM against endothelial dysfunction in hypertension.

However, in this in vitro study, we have analyzed the vasorelaxation induced by these triterpenoids in isolated aorta from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The triterpenoids tested induced concentration-dependent vasorelaxation, mostly involving nitric oxide (NO). Indeed, the responses were attenuated by removal of the endothelium or following pretreatment with the NO synthase inhibitor l-NAME. Furthermore, the differences that were observed in the potency of relaxation, the selectivity, and the dependence on the endothelium were attributed to structural features of the triterpenoids.

This olive husk is usually carried from presses to an Olive Waste Management Center where a mechanical milling extraction process is performed to obtain <b>Olive</b> <b>Pomace</b> <b>Oil.</b> The remaining oil in the husk is chemically extracted and finally, the residual husk is used as fuel for a cogeneration process to produce electricity. The <b>olive</b> <b>Pomace</b> <b>Oil</b> from mechanical milling has higher quality and price than the one extracted chemically. As the seasonal olive collection campaign is from October to March, husk usually is stored and processed along the year. Due to the own husk chemical degradation and the constrained milling capacity, not all received husk is milled mechanically but always chemically. Different pools are used to store and classify husk qualities. There are pools for short, medium and long term horizons. Short term pools have low storage capacity and contains high quality husk which is shortly milled mechanically. Medium term pools have higher storage capacity containing medium quality husk. These mid term pools provide husk to be milled mechanically when the collection rate decreases, or the husk quality coming from presses is poor. Long term pools have also high storage capacity and store husk with poor quality to be processed only chemically. The stochastic model is focused on optimal pouring decisions into different types of pools to improve {{the efficiency of the}} husk mechanical milling. Several probabilistic scenarios of weekly husk pouring from presses are included in the stochastic programming model. Blending husk with different qualities brings nonlinear constraints into the computation of milling efficiency. To cope with these nonlinearities, an accurate approximation has been developed.

Quantitative analysis of isoprenoids and methylsterols isolated from each grade of olive oil supports the decreasingly negative values of C- 13 /C- 12 ratios for the better grades of olive oil. These results {{have turned out to}} be a good tool for detecting adulteration of olive oil with the cheaper <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> even down to a 5 % level...|$|R
5000|$|Some foods whose {{processing}} creates press cakes are <b>olives</b> for <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (<b>pomace),</b> peanuts for peanut oil, coconut flesh for coconut {{cream and}} milk (sapal), grapes for wine (pomace), apples for cider (pomace), and soybeans for soy milk (used to make tofu) (this is called okara) or oil. Other common press cakes come from flax seed (linseed), cottonseed, and sunflower seeds. However, some specific kinds may be toxic, and are rather used as fertilizer, for example cottonseed contains a toxic pigment, gossypol, {{that must be}} removed before processing.|$|R
40|$|The Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to explore a new {{application}} for turning low value byproducts to value added bioactive components using a simple technique. Study Design: The large amounts of byproducts resulted had an environmentally harmful; the phenolic components were extracted using aqueous isopropanol from <b>olive</b> leaves and <b>pomace.</b> Place and Duration of Study: samples were analysed in laboratories of Fats and Oils Department, Toxicology and Food Contaminants; National Research Centre; and in Department of Food Technology, City of Scientific Research and Technological Application during season of 2016. Methodology: A novel extraction method was used to recover the remaining active components from olive processing wastes (OPWS) either from pomace or leaves. The oil residues re-extracted from dried pomace using n-hexane; collected as <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> Results: Although the OPWS considered as a harmful environmental byproduct; OPWs extracts showed a highly contents of polyphenols along with antioxidant activity, the best results recorded in <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> extract (POE), it had a good character to reduce toxigenic fungal growth and mycotoxins. Antimicrobial property, MIC and MFC of polar and non-polar extracts were determined. Conclusions: It showed a better antimicrobial character in conformity with its total phenolics, total flavonoids and antioxidant activities. The <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> extract showed a high content of bioactive components. The extracts had anti-mycotic properties against 4 types of toxigenic fungi, and anti-mycotoxigenic characters that showed a high ability of the <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> extracts either on fungal inhibition or reducing aflatoxin ratio...|$|R
