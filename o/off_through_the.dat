Frome station was opened in 1850 and is one of the oldest railway {{stations}} still in operation in Britain, now with direct services to London Paddington. Trains are operated by First Great Western. A freight line, which branches <b>off</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> town to serve the quarries on the Mendip Hills, is mainly used by Mendip Rail. A continuation of this line, which previously linked Frome to Radstock, is now the route of National Cycle Route 24, otherwise known as the Colliers Way.|$|E

Upon returning, she meets the Witch of the Waste, who transforms her into a ninety-year-old woman.

He leads her to Howl's moving castle, where she meets Howl's young apprentice, Markl, and the fire-demon Calcifer, who {{is the source of the}} castle's energy and magic.

25|$|Former ÖVP leader Wolfgang Schüssel claimed on 4 September 2008 the ÖVP's low {{numbers in}} the polls were due to {{the large number of}} parties contesting the {{election}} and denied that the ÖVP had made mistakes in their election campaign so far. Analysts asserted that the Greens' decision to strongly support the animal rights activists remanded in custody under controversial circumstances (see above) might be risky, but that it might pay <b>off</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> increased publicity and mobilisation of core voters.|$|E
25|$|The Capital Investment Program is {{a rolling}} 5-year plan which {{programs}} capital expenses.

Atzerodt {{was to go to}} Johnson's room at 10:15p.m. and shoot him. On April 14 Atzerodt rented the room directly above Johnson's; the next day he arrived there at the appointed time and, carrying a gun and knife, went to the bar downstairs, where he asked the bartender about Johnson's character and behavior. [...] He eventually became drunk and wandered <b>off</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets, tossing his knife away at some point.

500|$|To {{promote the}} album, the song [...] "Bull in the Heather" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} in April 1994.

The song reached No. 13 on the US Modern Rock Tracks and No. 24 on the UK Singles Chart. The track [...] "Self-Obsessed and Sexxee" [...] {{was intended to be}} the second single from the album. A promo CD was issued, but plans for a regular release were eventually canceled. The remaining copies were sold <b>off</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Sonic Death fan club magazine. The CD includes the same B-sides as [...] "Bull in the Heather". A music video featuring Kathleen Hanna was made for [...] "Bull in the Heather" [...] under the direction of Tamra Davis.|$|E
500|$|Horne {{enrolled}} at the London School of Economics in October 1925, where his tutors included Hugh Dalton and Stephen Leacock; he was dissatisfied with his time at the university and called Leacock [...] "one of the most boring lecturers I ever came across". During the general strike in 1926 volunteers were asked to enlist at the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies {{to take over the}} essential services; Horne joined, and spent two days driving a London bus before the strike was called <b>off.</b> <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> influence and generosity of an uncle, Austin Pilkington of the Pilkington glassmaking family of St Helens, he was able to enrol at Magdalene College, Cambridge in October 1926. He committed himself to the sporting side of life and represented the college at rugby, and in the relay team alongside the future Olympic gold medallist Lord Burghley. He also played tennis for the university, partnering Bunny Austin. Distracted by his athletic exploits, he neglected his studies and was [...] in December 1927.|$|E

Franco became involved with Dave Eggers' 826 National after Eggers asked him to do a conceptual idea for the program, and he directed a documentary for them and has since been a supporter of them. At the event, he spoke about how he thought schools needed to be more original with their literature programs. [...] "Writing can do things that video cannot", he added. In April 2011, Franco autographed a T-shirt that would be auctioned <b>off</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Yoshiki Foundation, with the proceeds being donated for Japanese tsunami relief. On June 14, he was honored by amfAR, the foundation for AIDS research, at the Museum of Modern Art.

500|$|... 1st Airborne Division's {{commanding}} officer, Major General Roy Urquhart, {{originally planned}} [...] for the 2nd Battalion {{to lead the}} 1st Parachute Brigade into Arnhem to secure the road, rail and pontoon bridges over the Lower Rhine. Frost chose Major Digby Tatham-Warter's A Company to lead the battalion's march from the drop zones to the bridges, knowing him to be [...] "a thruster if ever there was". A company was in action almost at once, ambushing a small German recce group near the drop zone. The company moved <b>off</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> woods toward the river road, with each platoon taking turns to lead. There was a brief plan to advance the platoons by jeep once out of the woods, but German forces were encountered shortly afterwards and the idea was not followed up. Grayburn had just arrived at a road junction and headed north when the men behind him came under enemy fire. After laying a smokescreen he led a charge that cleared the enemy positions. Tatham-Warter lacked confidence in the Airborne radio equipment and had trained his platoons to use bugle calls; {{it was with the}} charge that Grayburn signalled that the advance could be resumed.|$|E
500|$|The ride {{begins with}} a dousing of Floo Powder from Hermione Granger, who asks the guests to say, [...] "Observatory" [...] in order to {{transport}} them to their desired location, and the enchanted bench flies <b>off</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Floo Network to the Astronomy Tower. The guests leave the room of requirement through its fireplace and enter the Observatory, where they look out through the open arches to the hills and lake outside Hogwarts' boundary. As the guests fly {{out of one of}} the Observatory's arches, the ride smoothly switches to a wrap-around projection screen and they follow Harry Potter and Ron Weasley around Hogwarts' buildings and towers to a Quidditch match. As Harry and Ron travel under a bridge, Hagrid yields the riders and asks them if they have seen a dragon. As Harry redirects the riders' attentions back to their journey, Hagrid's pet Hungarian Horntail dragon begins to chase the riders. The bench flies out of the projection screen and into a set of the uneven bridge that crosses the valley behind Hogwarts and, after falling out of a hole in the floor of the bridge, they encounter an animatronic dragon, which breaths pressurized water mist with red lighting pointed to it to make it resemble fire.|$|E

500|$|Later, the Ganger Doctor has {{met with}} the other Gangers, and discovers their unwillingness to proceed. The Ganger Doctor uses the opportune call of Jimmy's son on his {{birthday}} to convince the Ganger Jimmy and the other Gangers they are just as real as their human counterparts. Ganger Jennifer becomes furious at this display and rages off; the other Gangers agree {{to work with the}} humans to escape the facility. They free the humans trapped in the acid storage room, and race <b>off</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> crypts below the monastery, chased by a savage Ganger Jennifer who has transformed herself into a monster. Both Ganger and human sacrifice themselves to stall the monster while letting {{the rest of the group}} escape. They eventually come onto a room where the TARDIS, having been trapped in a pool of acid outside, has fallen into the crypt. Ganger Cleaves offers to hold the door to allow the rest to escape, and the Doctor soon joins her, stunning Amy. To Amy's surprise, the Doctor reveals that he and his Ganger had switched shoes long ago; Amy's distrust of the Ganger was completely misplaced. Amy apologizes to the Ganger Doctor, who accepts but warns her to [...] "push, Amy, but only when she tells you to". As the surviving humans and Gangers escape to the TARDIS, the Cleaves and Doctor Gangers together face the monster, triggering a sonic screwdriver at the right moment to cause them and the monster to dissolve back into liquid.|$|E

On 9 February 1861 they reached the Little Bynoe River, {{an arm of the}} Flinders River delta, where they found they could not reach the ocean because of the mangrove swamps in their way. Burke and Wills left the camels behind with King and Gray at Camp CXIX (Camp 119), and set <b>off</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> swamps, although after [...] they decided to turn back. By this stage, they were desperately short of supplies. They had food left for 27 days, but it had already taken them 59 days to travel from Cooper Creek.|$|E
2500|$|The judges {{had passed}} and Fontan had no second bike. He reached a village and walked {{from house to}} house, {{knocking}} on doors before dawn to ask for one.
