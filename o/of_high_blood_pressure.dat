For these purposes, a decoction of the bark or leaves is generally used. Externally silver birch is used to promote healing, relieve pain and treat inflammations and infections of the skin such as eczema and psoriasis.|$|E

He was able to walk without a cane or walker, preferring not to use one, and was able to feed himself, including Cheerios for breakfast, his favorite vanilla ice cream with his other meals and a daily can of Ensure for energy. While he enjoyed recounting tales from his military experience, he never complained about the segregated nature of his unit, preferring instead to focus on his own exploits on the job.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of cases (60–80%) are not precipitated by a particular cause. A quarter has a history <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> {{but this is a}} common problem in the general population, and {{it is not clear whether}} it significantly increase the risk of apoplexy. A number of cases has been reported in association with particular conditions and situations; it is uncertain whether these were in fact causative. Amongst reported associations are surgery (especially coronary artery bypass graft, where there are significant fluctuations in the blood pressure), disturbances in blood coagulation or medication that inhibits coagulation, radiation therapy to the pituitary, traumatic brain injury, pregnancy (during which the pituitary enlarges) and treatment with estrogens. Hormonal stimulation tests of the pituitary have been reported to provoke episodes. Treatment of prolactinomas (pituitary adenomas that secrete prolactin) with dopamine agonist drugs, as well as withdrawal of such treatment, has been reported to precipitate apoplexy.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E

25|$|Early {{developments}} {{in the field of}} treating hypertension included quaternary ammonium ion sympathetic nervous system blocking agents, but these compounds were never widely used due to their severe side effects, because the long term health consequences <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> had not yet been established, and because they had to be administered by injection.|$|E

25|$|Spironolactone, marketed {{under the}} brand name Aldactone among others, is a {{medication}} that is primarily used to treat fluid build-up due to heart failure, liver scarring, or kidney disease.

25|$|Small vessel disease {{involves}} the smaller arteries inside the brain: {{branches of the}} circle of Willis, middle cerebral artery, stem, and arteries arising from the distal vertebral and basilar artery. Diseases that may form thrombi in the small vessels include (in descending incidence): lipohyalinosis (build-up of fatty hyaline matter in the blood vessel as a result <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and aging) and fibrinoid degeneration (a stroke involving these vessels are known as a lacunar stroke) and microatheroma (small atherosclerotic plaques).|$|E

In particular, due to significant advances in dialysis techniques, patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) can survive longer than ever before. Because these patients don't die as quickly as they used to, and as kidney failure increases with the rising age and prevalence <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and diabetes in a society, the need especially for kidneys rises every year.|$|E

25|$|Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a {{disorder}} of pregnancy {{characterized by the}} onset <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and often {{a significant amount of}} protein in the urine. The condition begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy. In severe disease there may be red blood cell breakdown, a low blood platelet count, impaired liver function, kidney dysfunction, swelling, shortness of breath due to fluid in the lungs, or visual disturbances. Pre-eclampsia increases the risk of poor outcomes for both the mother and the baby. If left untreated, it may result in seizures at which point it is known as eclampsia.|$|E
25|$|Reserpine (also {{known by}} trade names Raudixin, Serpalan, Serpasil) is an indole alkaloid, antipsychotic, and {{antihypertensive}} drug {{that has been}} used for the control <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and for the relief of psychotic symptoms, although because of the development of better drugs for these purposes and because of its numerous side-effects, it is rarely used today. The antihypertensive actions of reserpine are a result of its ability to deplete catecholamines (among other monoamine neurotransmitters) from peripheral sympathetic nerve endings. These substances are normally involved in controlling heart rate, force of cardiac contraction and peripheral vascular resistance.|$|E
25|$|Diabetes {{has several}} {{complications}} of {{which one is}} hypertension or high blood pressure. Data indicate that at least 60-80 percent of individuals whom develop diabetes will eventually develop high blood pressure. The high blood pressure is gradual at early stages and may take at least 10–15 years to fully develop. Besides diabetes, other factors that may also increase high blood pressure include obesity, insulin resistance and high cholesterol levels. In general, fewer than 25 percent of diabetics have good control of their blood pressure. The presence <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in diabetes {{is associated with a}} 4 fold increase in death chiefly from heart disease and strokes.|$|E
