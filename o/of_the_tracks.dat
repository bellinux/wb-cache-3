5|$|All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> are powered {{with a third}} rail, except Track 1. The {{station has}} two {{high-level}} side platforms, each eight cars long.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on May 24, 2004, {{construction}} of new platforms began at Clinton, Guilford, and Branford. The rebuilt Clinton station opened on July 25, 2005, and the rebuilt Branford station opened on August 8, 2005; both consist of a single high-level platform {{on the south side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> The new Guilford station, which has platforms on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> (connected by a pedestrian bridge) to allow for greater operational flexibility, opened on November 28, 2005. Construction at Madison started on September 24, 2007, and finished {{with the opening of the}} rebuilt station platform on July 28, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> near Tainan {{were badly}} damaged during the {{earthquake}} on 6 February 2016. All high-speed rail services south of Chiayi Station were suspended until 7 February 2016.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>track</b> listing {{for both}} editions is the same. However, <b>the</b> running time <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remastered <b>tracks</b> vary from <b>the</b> {{original}} release {{due to a}} different placement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> marks between songs. In many cases, <b>the</b> <b>track</b> mark changes move a song's spoken introduction from <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> to <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preceding <b>track.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, a 12" [...] {{pressing}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> [...] "3" [...] {{was released}} and sold alongside +Dome at Seekae's headline and support slot shows around Australia, featuring a club-edit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> on <b>the</b> A-side (mixed by Seekae) and a remix <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> by Belgian techno/house producer Locked Groove (Hotflush Recordings).|$|R
5|$|A red-painted {{house for}} the {{signalman}} was put up close to the station. Tryvandsbanen also developed plans for building a station house with a waiting shed, but these never materialised. The name of the red-painted house was changed from Nordpolen ("The North Pole") to Norden ("The North") and it was modernised after the removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> The station was included on the Nordmarka maps published in 1913 and 1938.|$|E
5|$|For {{its release}} on 26 January, {{the album is}} {{available}} as a box set which includes the whole album on six 7-inch vinyl singles and as a 2 disc limited edition. These special editions are only available in Europe and include a bonus disc called Blood which contains dub versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> from the album.|$|E
5|$|For many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks,</b> the English names {{used in the}} iTunes release are {{different}} than the literal translation of the Japanese names, which {{were used for the}} original soundtrack. When the literal translation differs, it is marked after the Japanese name.|$|E
50|$|It was {{the first}} Grand Prix {{to be held at}} Hockenheimring since <b>the</b> <b>track</b> was redesigned, which had seen <b>the</b> forest {{sections}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> removed and hence <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> shortened.|$|R
50|$|The line runs on <b>the</b> {{left-hand}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> {{as opposed to}} <b>the</b> right-hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> like all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other Seoul Metropolitan Subway lines do.|$|R
50|$|Men's {{start at}} the tower start house (currently not demolished) at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> while <b>the</b> women's is at the regular starthouse at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R
5|$|For the film's {{music and}} soundtrack, Raju renewed his {{previous}} association (Arya and Bhadra) with Devi Sri Prasad. Savitha Reddy rendered the voice for Genelia's {{character in the}} film. A feature of this film is Siddharth singing one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> from the film.|$|E
5|$|Hidden Treasures is an EP by American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} on July 18, 1995 by Capitol Records. The album features songs that {{first appeared on}} movie soundtracks and tribute albums. Four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> were released as singles, and three have received Grammy Award nominations for Best Metal Performance. Despite having garnered mediocre or negative reviews, the material on the EP has been credited with helping expand the group's MTV audience in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|However, after further consideration, the Coast Guard {{announced}} in April 2013 {{that the museum}} was to be located at Union Station. The main portion of the museum is to be located east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks,</b> with a new 500-passenger ferry terminal likely integrated into the four-story, 54,300-square-foot glass-faced building. A pedestrian bridge will connect the museum to the station and the northbound platform, {{as well as to}} the Water Street garage.|$|E
50|$|A version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{video was}} also {{produced}} for the Dehasse Radio Edit, a dance version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> remixed for <b>the</b> 2012 re-emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> in <b>the</b> UK charts.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>track</b> is left-handed undulating {{course with}} a sharp bend into the home straight. Horses drawn low (i.e. on <b>the</b> inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track)</b> usually have <b>the</b> advantage. The final 3 furlongs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> are uphill, making it quite testing.|$|R
5|$|In 2002, Thornton {{announced}} The Resurrection of Dr. Octagon, {{a proposed}} sequel to Dr. Octagonecologyst that would reintroduce the character. Los Angeles-based producer Fanatik J {{was chosen to}} create the music for the album. Thornton himself {{took part in the}} production of early material for the project, playing bass, guitar, and keyboards on many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Westenra {{released}} a new album, Odyssey. A mix of classical, pop, Celtic, and new-age music, she co-wrote and arranged some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> on the album, which {{was released in}} the United States on 18 October 2005. A more recent version of Odyssey containing several recordings not on the original album was released in the United Kingdom on 10 April 2006, her 19th birthday.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, {{because of}} {{to changes in}} Amtrak rules, {{passengers}} were no longer allowed to cross tracks to access trains. New platforms were opened {{on the south side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> at Branford and Westbrook at approximately the same locations.|$|E
40|$|With the {{constantly}} {{increasing demand}} for heavy freight trans-portation, railways {{have become an}} extremely important element in <b>the</b> economic wellbeing <b>of</b> any country, and particularly in a developing country like South Africa. It is thus <b>the</b> duty <b>of</b> <b>track</b> engineers to maintain a continued understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rail <b>track</b> infrastructure. Track designs should be as cost-eff ective as possible and should {{be sensitive to the}} costs associated with the planning, development and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> structure. Extensive and continuous research is therefore required to de-termine the infl uencing parameters and to maximise <b>the</b> <b>track</b> performance and <b>the</b> lifetime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> structure. Deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> structure is a good measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structural capability <b>of</b> a <b>track</b> structure or <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expected <b>track</b> performance. Th is deformation is vastly dependent on <b>the</b> support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> structure. Th e ballast support and th...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>track</b> is superelevated so that <b>the</b> {{component}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acceleration <b>of</b> gravity in <b>the</b> plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> {{will provide}} some fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horizontal acceleration in <b>the</b> plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> due to <b>the</b> circular motion. Referring to the figure above, {{it can be}} seen that <b>the</b> components <b>of</b> gravitational and centripetal acceleration in <b>the</b> plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> will be equal when the following balance equation is satisfied, where α is the bank angle.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout early-mid 2015, more snippets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> and {{its music}} video {{surfaced}} over the internet, revealing that <b>the</b> release date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track's</b> full music video to be 11 May 2015 and confirming <b>the</b> <b>track's</b> title to be [...] "Fire Under My Feet" [...] rather than [...] "Fire".

5|$|In the PlayStation version, a mini-game of Galaxian can {{be played}} as the game loads. If won, eight {{additional}} cars become available. Once the game has loaded, the CD is needed only to play six music tracks. The disc can be replaced {{at any time during}} gameplay, although the game does not update; regardless of what disc is inserted, there will always be six tracks, corresponding to the starting points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> on the game disc.|$|E
5|$|Made up {{of various}} {{unreleased}} tracks, b-sides, and singles, the album contains tracks from the band's first recording session in March 1990, {{as well as}} recordings sourced from several live performances. As a result, the tracks feature various bassists and drummers from past lineups, including drummers Caroline Rue and Patty Schemel, and bassists Jill Emery and Kristen Pfaff. Frontwoman Courtney Love is also featured playing bass guitar in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> The album is dedicated to Pfaff's memory.|$|E
5|$|Mimi pulls Carey in two {{opposite}} directions. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> {{find her}} paired with the hottest hip hop {{producers of the}} day; there, she exercises restraint and settles into a groove. But on the rest, she does what comes most naturally to her—belting to her heart's desire, perhaps to mollify those who don't care much for her detours into raunchier rap territory.|$|E
50|$|A plastic {{piece at}} one end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> serves as both a {{handhold}} for the toy and an adjustable slider to position <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> narrower <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> <b>the</b> faster the wheel goes, because the axle is thicker {{in the middle and}} you get more distance per each rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wheel. Widen <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> and <b>the</b> wheel goes slower.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> {{was also}} {{an issue in the}} Sprint race, as South Africa's Adrian Zaugg spun and stalled his car, {{blocking}} half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> safety car was deployed, as a flatbed truck came to remove the stricken vehicle and blocked <b>the</b> entire <b>track,</b> halting <b>the</b> remaining cars.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{alignment}} uncertainties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CMS Tracker detector, {{made of a}} {{huge amount}} of independent silicon sensors with an excellent position resolution, affect <b>the</b> performances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> reconstruction, <b>the</b> <b>track</b> parameters measurement and the vertex reconstruction. In order to study <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mis-alignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CMS <b>tracking</b> devices on <b>the</b> previous procedures, realistic estimates for <b>the</b> expected displacements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> systems are supplied in two different scenarios, the first supposed to reproduce the mis-alignment conditions during the first data taking while the second one related to long term data taking condition. Results about <b>the</b> <b>track</b> reconstruction are expressed in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resolution on <b>track</b> parameters, <b>the</b> global efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> reconstruction and <b>the</b> fake rate in <b>the</b> two scenarios <b>of</b> mis-alignment, by comparing them with <b>the</b> scenario <b>of</b> a perfect alignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> devices.

The album {{also include the}} original Metroid tracks composed by Hirokazu Tanaka, and additional tracks arranged by Yoshiyuki Ito and Masumi Ito.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> in Wipeout 64 feature {{mirrored}} layouts of circuits from select {{tracks in}} Wipeout and Wipeout 2097, set in different locations. Some conversions are not perfectly accurate, as some corners were eased or cut entirely, elevations were changed, {{and there were}} no split track sections.|$|E
5|$|North of this station, two {{additional}} tracks are {{located within the}} right-of-way. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> is used to allow for Rockaway Park Shuttle trains to relay and {{to go back into}} service to the Rockaways, while the other track is called the Far Rockaway Test Track. The latter of the two tracks is used to test new subway cars {{to make sure that they}} are ready for acceptance into New York City Transit's fleet of subway cars.|$|E
