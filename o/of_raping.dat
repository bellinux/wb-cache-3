40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{usefulness}} of the feminist theory in explaining atti- tudes toward <b>rape</b> and victims <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> in Ghana. The feminist theory <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> posits, inter alia, that patriarchy and gender inequality are major factors in the aetiology <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> and attitudes toward rape and that underlying patriarchy and gender inequality are gender stereotypes and false beliefs (myths) about rape, rapists, and victims <b>of</b> <b>rape.</b> Thus, the theory suggests a relationship between rape myths and less favorable attitudes toward <b>rape</b> and victims <b>of</b> <b>rape.</b> Results from a survey conducted in Ghana show some support for the feminist theory of rape: There is evidence <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> myth acceptance in Ghana; gender is significant in predicting levels <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> myth acceptance; and finally, education or profession and age, but not religion, are associated with levels <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> myth acceptance in a predictable way...|$|R

He was part of the squad that won the gold medal at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, and came seventh in the 1957 Ballon d'Or. Early the next year his promising career was interrupted by a rape scandal. The 20-year-old Streltsov was accused <b>of</b> <b>raping</b> a woman shortly before the 1958 World Cup; told he could still play if he admitted his guilt, he confessed, despite inconclusive evidence against him. He was instead convicted and sentenced to twelve years in the Gulag system of forced labour camps.|$|E
5|$|Karađorđe was feared by {{enemies and}} allies alike {{because of his}} {{volatile}} temper. In 1806, he had ordered that his brother Marinko be hanged. According to one account, Marinko had been accused <b>of</b> <b>raping</b> a peasant girl. Another suggests {{that he had been}} attempting to seduce young women whose husbands were away at the front. Whatever the case, Karađorđe entertained senior rebel leaders in his home while his brother's lifeless body dangled from the front gate—a warning to others to refrain from the behaviour in which Marinko had been engaging.|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the relative merits}} of sociodemographic variables and psychological variables in understanding women’s fear <b>of</b> <b>rape.</b> A comprehensive understanding of the factors involved in women’s fear <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> may allow for more effective interventions with women. Four hundred and eleven women, aged 18 years or older participated in the study, which surveyed their fear <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> and experience <b>of</b> <b>rape.</b> In agreement with previous findings, sociodemographic variables contributed significantly but relatively little (13 %) to the variance in women’s fear <b>of</b> <b>rape.</b> In contrast, psychological factors (perceived likelihood <b>of</b> being <b>raped</b> and perceived severity of consequences) predicted an additional 29 % of the variance to this fear. Greater perceived likelihood <b>of</b> being <b>raped</b> functioned as a partial mediating variable between sociodemographic factors of age and relationship status and women’s fear <b>of</b> <b>rape.</b> These results are encouraging as psychological models provide more avenues for restructuring such fear and modifying concordant, dysfunctional behaviours. Consequently, these results provide direction to intervention and education programs aimed at reducing women’s fear <b>of</b> <b>rape.</b> Fear <b>of</b> crime has traditionally been investigated by attempts to link this construct with sociodemographic variables (Parker & Ray, 1990). Sociodemographic factors have included gender, race, relationship status, age, socioeconomic status, education, and in the case <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>rape,</b> whether or not a women has a history of rap...|$|R

5|$|Donna Lee Brien {{stated that}} just as the filmmakers {{attempted}} {{to distance themselves from}} Leigh's murder, the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from Blackrock. A 1999 feature in The Sydney Morning Herald discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from Mel Gibson's 1977 debut film Summer City to a short film festival that year, but made no mention of Blackrock. Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have been due to public frustration with the legal system, as the film achieves justice for the victim, whereas no one was ever convicted <b>of</b> <b>raping</b> Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, while {{a sophomore}} at Pennsylvania State University, Parker and his roommate and wrestling teammate, Jean McGianni Celestin, were accused <b>of</b> <b>raping</b> a fellow student. The unnamed accuser stated that Parker and Celestin raped her while she was {{intoxicated}} and unconscious, {{and that she was}} unsure of how many people had been involved. The woman later went to a doctor, who concluded that she had been sexually assaulted, and local authorities taped a phone conversation between her and Parker in which Parker confirmed that it was he and Celestin who had sex with her. She also stated that the two harassed her after she pressed charges, and that they hired a private investigator who showed her picture around campus, revealing her identity.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that allegations of assault were made against another teacher in the 1980s. On 12 February, Professor Malcolm Layfield, Head of Strings at the Royal Northern College of Music resigned from the RNCM Board after claims of his previous sexual misconduct were brought up during the Brewer hearing. Before his appointment at RNCM, Layfield had admitted to having relationships with six Chetham's pupils aged between 16 and 18 whilst he taught there. Two RNCM teachers, including Head of Keyboard Studies Martin Roscoe, resigned in protest at his appointment in 2002. In October 2013 Layfield was arrested on suspicion <b>of</b> <b>raping</b> and indecently assaulting an 18-year-old woman between 1988 and 1999, but {{was found not guilty}} at a trial in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Despite Governor Catts' {{change of}} attitude, white mob action {{frequently}} occurred in towns throughout north and central Florida and went unchecked by local law enforcement. Extrajudicial violence against black residents was so common that it seldom {{was covered by}} newspapers. In 1920, whites removed four black men from jail, who were suspects accused <b>of</b> <b>raping</b> a white woman in Macclenny, and lynched them. In Ocoee the same year, two black citizens armed themselves {{to go to the}} polls during an election. A confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot, after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee's black community, causing as many as 30 deaths, and destroying 25 homes, two churches, and a Masonic Lodge. Just weeks before the Rosewood massacre, the Perry Race Riot occurred on 14 and 15 December 1922, in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked the black community of Perry, Florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered. On the day following Wright's lynching, whites shot and hanged two more black men in Perry; next they burned the town's black school, Masonic lodge, church, amusement hall, and several families' homes.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in October 2003 by producer Subhash Ghai, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his production company Mukta Arts. The media reported that Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were cast in lead roles, making it the third film collaboration between Kumar and Chopra after the highly successful Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004). Kumar was cast as Raj, a working man accused of rape at his workplace; Kapoor portrayed his supportive wife, who goes to extremes to defend him. According to the directors, Kumar was cast against type; he generally played action heros, and {{they wanted him to}} underplay his character. Abbas–Mustan, known for stylish thrillers and intriguing antagonists, cast Chopra in her first negative role. She plays a woman, married to a business magnate more than twice her age (played by Amrish Puri), who falsely accuses her ex-lover (Kumar) <b>of</b> <b>raping</b> her to seek revenge. Chopra was initially apprehensive about such a bold character, due to the controversial theme of sexual harassment, but Abbas–Mastan and Subhash Ghai convinced her to accept the role. The director duo had previously offered her the lead role in their 2002 thriller Humraaz, which she could not do.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{studies have}} {{established}} that the problem <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> aggravates if it is unacknowledged {{as a result of}} the influence of social perception and victim’s rape script. Such victims will be susceptible to psychological distress and lowered self-esteem among other negative effects. In Nigeria, the social perception <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> has been described as serving to perpetuate the sexual victimisation against women. This study therefore, examined how the social perception <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> impact on personal attitudinal beliefs <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> among female university students in the country and the extent to which <b>rape</b> scripts <b>of</b> young women lead to the growing rate <b>of</b> unacknowledged <b>rape.</b> Using a mixed-method victimisation survey that covered four universities in Lagos and Ogun states, Nigeria; the study recruited 206 female students who have experienced rape or attempted <b>rape,</b> while 12 <b>of</b> them were further engaged in in-depth interviews. The results of the study suggest that not acknowledging a rape is primarily a response to suffering an assault that is not consistent with societal definitions <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> and supporting script theory. The study also found that some of the strongly held rape myth among young female university students include; non-recognition <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> incidence between dating partners, non-recognition <b>of</b> domestic <b>rape</b> between husband and wife, rape is always for the sake <b>of</b> sex, <b>rape</b> is only perpetrated by stranger or mere acquaintances, women are mostly responsible for their rape victimisation and if the location <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> or sexua...|$|R

5000|$|The fear <b>of</b> <b>rape,</b> {{unlike other}} fears of {{specific}} crimes, is almost exclusive to women. Among women, {{it is also}} one of the strongest crime-related fears, and is the strongest crime-related fear for young women. Levels <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> vary among women by age, race/ethnicity, residential area, and other factors, but are especially high for women who have been victims <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> in the past or know victims personally (the latter group may include a significant portion of women, with one study estimating that over half <b>of</b> women know <b>rape</b> victims). The fear <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> may also be related to the fear of murder, as women tend to overestimate the proportion <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> victims who are murdered during their attacks.
