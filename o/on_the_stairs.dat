5|$|Stewart {{was born}} on 13 June 1976. When she was 17 years old she injured her right ankle when she tripped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> This {{developed}} into reflex sympathetic dystrophy. She then fractured a bone in her left leg, which set off dystrophy in that leg as well. This resulted in her needing a wheelchair for mobility. She plays the saxophone in a band. She attended University of New South Wales and Sydney University, where she took classes in Cognitive Science, English, and Philosophy. She has BSc (Honours) in Philosophy and Cognitive Science and a BA in English from the University of New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Munch and Kellerman {{investigate}} a murder at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a late-season baseball game, leaving 48,000 possible suspects. The Long Island man, presumably a Yankees fan, is found {{beaten to death}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> of the stadium, and the governor of Maryland pressures the police department to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized. After several fruitless interviews, Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell (Brian Tarantina), a New Yorker who attended the game with the victim. Russell admits he killed the victim because he said the Baltimore Orioles were a better team than the Yankees. He agrees to confess to the murder if they let him watch {{the rest of the}} game. Back at the police department, Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting. Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman's role in the shooting could bring both of them down if Falsone continues his questioning.|$|E

5|$|The two-story brick {{structure}} {{is supported by}} a fieldstone foundation and still features its original front porch. The porch spans the length of the building's front (south) facade, at a height of about 6feet (1.8m). The porch is supported by four wooden pillars, which rest on stone bases. The stairs leading to the front porch are supported by two similar wooden posts, which, like the house, are set into fieldstone bases. The first step <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> was originally a limestone block embedded in the ground. The porch roof is supported by six wooden, bracketed pillars. The pillars are simple, with the brackets coming from the boxed capitals. At the rear of the porch wooden pilasters set at each end help to support the roof. Differentiating the home from the traditional French Colonial design is the porch roof, which is separate from the main roof.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} scenes of Brown wearing a {{mirrored}} mask inside a giant birdcage, before {{switching to a}} dance routine in a smoke-filled, graffiti-covered parking garage. In between these scenes, the video shows a Step Up-type dance-off in the parking garage. When Brown raps his verse, he is seen standing next to Rhymes, wearing horn-rimmed glasses, a red Brooklyn cap, and a white baseball jersey, which was the signature look of Mars Blackmon from the 1986 film, She's Gotta Have It. Rhymes then raps his verse after Brown's, standing beside him and later <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> in the parking garage. Wayne's verse soon follows after, with scenes of him rapping {{in front of the}} DeLorean DMC-12 sports car, and also on top of an ambulance car. The video also features cameo appearance from Kevin McCall, Diplo, Birdman and Mack Maine. Birdman and Maine appear when Lil Wayne is performing his verse.|$|E
5|$|Piper {{reported}} {{that as he}} was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously {{in the shadows of the}} cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E

He was revolutionary. I was a bit daunted." [...] The play Orton had brought was called The Boy Hairdresser, which was later changed to <b>The</b> Ruffian <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stair.</b> Equally as important, Tydeman’s nurturing of Orton finally saw <b>The</b> Ruffian <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stair</b> appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> BBC, with Kenneth Cranham in the leading role, several years later, but only after Tydeman had introduced Orton’s work to the theatrical agent Peggy Ramsay. That led to Orton’s Entertaining Mr Sloane appearing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> London stage just months before the radio broadcast of <b>The</b> Ruffian <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stair.</b>|$|R

A couple of people also stopped, trying to help the fan in need, but the moving dense crowd <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> limited by metal banisters, promptly crushed them down.
