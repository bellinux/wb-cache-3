5|$|Countless {{results in}} number theory invoke the {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic and the algebraic properties of even numbers, so the above choices have far-reaching consequences. For example, {{the fact that}} positive numbers have unique factorizations means that one can determine whether a number has an even or odd number <b>of</b> <b>distinct</b> prime factors. Since 1 is not prime, nor does it have prime factors, it {{is a product of}} 0 distinct primes; since 0 is an even number, 1 has an even number <b>of</b> <b>distinct</b> prime factors. This implies that the Möbius function takes the value , which is necessary for it to be a multiplicative function and for the Möbius inversion formula to work.|$|E

5|$|Prior {{to modern}} times, horse breeds {{throughout}} Europe were known {{primarily by the}} name of the region where they were bred. The Lusitano takes its name from Lusitania, an ancient Roman name for the region that today is Portugal. A very similar horse, the Spanish Andalusian, originally described the horses <b>of</b> <b>distinct</b> quality that came from Andalusia in Spain. Some sources state that the Andalusian and the Lusitano are genetically the same breed, and the only difference is the country in which individual horses are born. The Lusitano is also known as the Portuguese, Peninsular, National or Betico-lusitano horse.|$|E
5|$|The absence <b>of</b> <b>distinct</b> {{currencies}} also theoretically removes {{exchange rate}} risks, although {{the imposition of}} transfer restrictions in 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis means {{that the situation is}} not quite so simple. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.|$|E

5|$|The number <b>of</b> <b>distinct</b> {{solutions}} {{can also}} be identified with Burnside's Lemma. For a solution, the set of equivalent solutions which can be reached using these operations (excluding relabeling), form an orbit of the symmetric group. The number of essentially different solutions is then the number of orbits, which can be computed using Burnside's lemma. The Burnside fixed points are solutions that differ only by relabeling. Using this technique, Jarvis/Russell computed the number of essentially different (symmetrically distinct) solutions as 5,472,730,538.|$|E

Most spines are straight or at most slightly curved, and are described as hair-like, bristle-like, needle-like or awl-like, depending on their length and thickness. Some cacti have flattened spines (e.g. Schlerocactus papyracanthus). Other cacti have hooked spines. Sometimes, one or more central spines are hooked, while outer spines are straight (e.g., Mammillaria rekoi).|$|E

5|$|After the referendum, Chrétien {{attempted}} to pursue constitutional recognition <b>of</b> <b>distinct</b> society, but {{was stopped by}} the blunt refusal of Ontario Premier Mike Harris to discuss any constitutional matters. Not wanting to engage the same negotiations with provincial governments that had dominated the Trudeau and Mulroney governments, Chrétien opted to pursue unilateral Federal changes to fulfill his government's commitments. This included the Act respecting constitutional amendments, which required permission from the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia for Federal approval to be granted to any Constitutional amendment, granting Quebec a de facto veto. The Federal parliament also officially recognized Quebec as a distinct society. Both changes, not being constitutional amendments, are theoretically reversible by future parliaments.|$|E

The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to heat. The metal {{in this area is}} often weaker than both the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.|$|E
5|$|Alternative rock {{is a broad}} {{umbrella}} term {{consisting of}} music that differs greatly {{in terms of its}} sound, its social context, and its regional roots. By the end of the 1980s magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock, helping to define a number <b>of</b> <b>distinct</b> styles (and music scenes) such as noise pop, indie rock, grunge, and alternative hip hop. Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands representing them, such as Hüsker Dü and R.E.M., had even signed to major labels. But most alternative bands' commercial success was limited in comparison to other genres of rock and pop music at the time, and most acts remained signed to independent labels and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream and many alternative bands became successful.|$|E
5|$|Chagall also invited other Russian artists, {{most notably}} the painter and art {{theoretician}} Kazimir Malevich and Lissitzky's former teacher, Yehuda Pen. However, {{it was not until}} October 1919 when Lissitzky, then on an errand in Moscow, persuaded Malevich to relocate to Vitebsk. The move coincided {{with the opening of the}} first art exhibition in Vitebsk directed by Chagall. Malevich would bring with him a wealth of new ideas, most of which inspired Lissitzky but clashed with local public and professionals who favored figurative art and with Chagall himself. After going through impressionism, primitivism, and cubism, Malevich began developing and advocating his ideas on suprematism aggressively. In development since 1915, suprematism rejected the imitation of natural shapes and focused more on the creation <b>of</b> <b>distinct,</b> geometric forms. He replaced the classic teaching program with his own and disseminated his suprematist theories and techniques school-wide. Chagall advocated more classical ideals and Lissitzky, still loyal to Chagall, became torn between two opposing artistic paths. Lissitzky ultimately favoured Malevich's suprematism and broke away from traditional Jewish art. Chagall left the school shortly thereafter.|$|E
