5|$|Even so, churches {{within the}} Assemblies of God have {{experienced}} revivals {{in the last}} two decades which featured worship and practices reminiscent of early Pentecostalism. The most prominent of these was the Brownsville Revival, which occurred at the Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Florida, from 1995 into the early 2000s. These revivals often faced criticism from within and without the Assemblies of God for their unpredictability and the dramatic religious experiences <b>of</b> <b>participants.</b> In the case of the Brownsville Revival, the AG's national leadership gave it cautious approval and support.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the calculation of association, {{it is common to}} take into account any variables that could potentially confound the results. Sex and age are common examples of confounding variables. Moreover, it is also known that many genetic variations are associated with the geographical and historical populations in which the mutations first arose. Because of this association, studies must take account of the geographical and ethnical background <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> by controlling for what is called population stratification.|$|E
40|$|Within {{the social}} {{services}} field, researchers, policy makers, and practitioners are paying increasing attention {{to the concept of}} `evidence based 2 ̆ 7 home visiting program models. However, a singular focus on evidence based programs continues a tradition of limited and vague understandings of how programs are actually implemented. The field of implementation science offers a framework for expanding this focus to more fully understand how home visiting programs are implemented. A key dimension <b>of</b> implementation is <b>participant</b> responsiveness. The field of home visiting lacks a coherent and standard conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>participant</b> responsiveness. As one might expect, it also lacks standard measurement <b>of</b> <b>participant</b> responsiveness. While research is sparse on many components <b>of</b> <b>participant</b> responsiveness, the component <b>of</b> <b>participant</b> engagement may be an especially beneficial component to initially concentrate on. Participant engagement in home visiting, as conceptualized in this study, includes the amount and quality <b>of</b> <b>participant</b> 2 ̆ 7 s interest, involvement, and participation during home visits. It is only through participant engagement in home visits and sustained engagement across home visits that meaningful participant outcomes are likely to be obtained. Existing measures <b>of</b> <b>participant</b> engagement in home visits are limited to global measures of engagement rated by either external observers or home visitors, or self-reports by participants. As designed, these measures capture only general impressions <b>of</b> <b>participant</b> engagement and fail to capture time-sensitive, specific instances <b>of</b> <b>participant</b> engagement. This failure limits the ability to explore causal relationships between strategies on the part of home visitors and participant engagement. The proposed study is designed to address these limitations and answer the following research questions: 1) Do home visitors feel engagement in home visits impacts their work? 2) Do home visiting programs monitor participant engagement during home visits? 3) Do home visitors receive training on engaging participants? Do home visitors feel a need for additional training and/or preparation on participant engagement? 4) Are there notable differences between global measures of engagement and frequency counts of specific indicators of engagement and disengagement? 5) Do home visitor strategies relate to participant engagement? Likewise, do home visitor strategies relate to participant disengagement...|$|R
