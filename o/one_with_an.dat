5|$|A further {{six years}} elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' fourth {{full-length}} album. With Teeth {{was released in}} May 2005, though it was leaked prior to its official release date. The album was written and recorded throughout 2004 following Reznor's battle with alcoholism and substance abuse and legal issues with his former manager, John Malm Jr. With Teeth debuted {{on top of the}} Billboard 200, Nine Inch Nails' second reign at number <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> album. The album's package lacks typical liner notes; instead it simply lists the names of songs and co-producers, and the URL for an online PDF poster with lyrics and full credits. The entire album was made available in streaming audio on the band's official MySpace page in advance of its release date.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, the {{smallest}} possible object that could possess an absolute magnitude of +1 (a perfectly reflective <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> albedo of 1) would be 838km in diameter. It {{is highly unlikely}} that any body of this size or larger, regardless of composition, would not also surpass whatever threshold is ultimately adopted as proof of hydrostatic equilibrium. However, if it turns out upon further investigation that an object named {{as if it were a}} plutoid has not achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, the IAU has stated it will be reclassified, but keep its name.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{necklaces}} features lion-headed terminals, {{and another}} includes stylized dolphins. The other four are relatively plain loop-in-loop chains, although {{one has a}} Chi-Rho symbol (☧) on the clasp, the only Christian element in the jewellery. Necklaces of similar lengths would normally be worn in the Roman period with a pendant, but no pendants {{were found in the}} hoard. The three rings were originally set with gems, which might have been natural gemstones, or pieces of coloured glass; however, these were taken from the rings before they were buried, perhaps for reuse. The rings are of similar design, <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> oval bezel, one with a circular bezel, and one with a large oblong bezel.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013 Mitsubishi Motors {{reported}} {{two separate}} incidents with lithium-ion batteries used in its plug-in electric cars, <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> i-MiEV {{and the other}} with an Outlander P-HEV whose battery pack overheated and melted some of the battery cells. The battery packs are produced by GS Yuasa, the same company that supplies the batteries for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, whose entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 for lithium-ion battery problems. The lithium-ion battery of an i-MiEV caught fire at the Mizushima battery pack assembly plant on March 18 while connected to charge-discharge test equipment. Mitsubishi did not issue a recall, but halted production and sales of the two models until it determined the causes of the battery problems. According to Mitsubishi, the problem with the i-MiEV battery pack is related to a change in the GS Yuasa manufacturing process, and the carmaker notified fleet-vehicle operators with i-MiEVs whose batteries were made under the same process as those that overheated, and is working on a possible fix.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{proceeded}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Dewes and Hutton opened for England. Dewes took a single from Lindwall's opening over and thus faced {{the start of}} the second over, which was bowled by Miller, who had troubled him in the past and dismissed him several times. During his short innings, Dewes was visibly nervous and kept on moving around, unable to stand still. Miller caused a stoppage after his first ball to sprinkle sawdust on the slippery and damp crease. With his second ball, he bowled Dewes—who was playing across the line—middle stump for <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inswinger to leave England at 1/2. He then removed Jack Crapp caught behind from an outside edge for a 23-ball duck, leaving England at 4/23 as play was adjourned for lunch. The paceman ended with 2/5 from eight overs; Lindwall took 6/20 and England were all out for 52. In his last Test innings for the summer, Miller scored five before overbalancing and being stumped. Australia made 389 and led by 337 on the first innings on the second afternoon. Bowling for the second time, Miller struck Crapp {{in the head with a}} bouncer, before bowling him for nine. He then extracted an edge from Hutton—who fell for 64, having top-scored in both innings—to wicket-keeper Tallon, leaving England at 4/153. Miller ended with 2/22 as Australia won by an innings and took a 4–0 series win.|$|E

5|$|The top ten in {{the general}} {{classification}} finished together {{in the next five}} stages, which were mostly friendly to sprinters and breakaways. Stage 20 was another time trial, <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> uphill finish. This time trial was won convincingly by Leipheimer, as only Contador and Valverde were within a minute of his winning time. This ride put Leipheimer 46 seconds off Contador's time. With the Vuelta's final stage flat and largely ceremonial, akin to the Champs-Élysées stage in the Tour de France, this stood as the final result, with Contador winning the Vuelta to complete his career triple; he also won the combination classification and its white jersey. Minor controversy followed the Vuelta; Contador alleged that Leipheimer was not being a team player by seeming to ride the Stage 20 time trial with the aim of winning the Vuelta, after Contador had apparently been decided as the team's leader, though the team had not firmly chosen a leader as the race began.|$|E

25|$|After {{excavating}} {{the tomb}} KV63 it is speculated {{that it was}} designed for Ankhesenamen due to its proximity to the tomb of Tutankhamun's KV62. Also found in the tomb were coffins (<b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> imprint of a woman on it), women's clothing, jewelry and natron. Fragments of pottery bearing the partial name Paaten were also in the tomb. The only royal person known to bear this name was Ankhesenamen, whose name was originally Ankhesenpaaten.

25|$|The {{original}} surface had {{an accuracy}} of ±1/8inch, {{which meant that}} the telescope could observe at higher frequencies than the Lovell Telescope. The surface was upgraded in 1987 to <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> accuracy of 1/3mm, which was accurately set using a holographic technique, meaning that the telescope can observe at the 22GHz MERLIN frequency.

25|$|The toy of Red Alert {{was sold}} by itself, {{as well as}} {{packaged}} with the Mini-Con Dirtboss and a Tiny-Tin as a promotion at Walmart stores. Oddly, though the Walmart promotional Red Alert was identical to the regular deluxe sized <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Earth Cyber Key included, the box stated Red Alert came with a Speed Planet Cyber Key and had information about the Speed Planet on the side panel. The reason he has a multi-medical tool instead of a left hand is because it was sliced off in the conflict before Armada by Starscream.|$|E

50|$|Akin to carbon monoxide, isocyanides are {{described}} by two resonance structures, <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> triple {{bond between the}} nitrogen and the carbon and <b>one</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> double bond between. Surprisingly, the second <b>one,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> carbenic character is the more important. Nevertheless, the π lone pair of the nitrogen, responsible of the zwitterionic structure, stabilizes the structure and is responsible of the linearity of isocyanides. Isocyanides are best shown as a mixture of both resonance structures. They are susceptible to polymerization.|$|R
