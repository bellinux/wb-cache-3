One of the approaches is <b>optimistic</b> <b>timed</b> cosimulation {{and the other is}} non-IPC (interprocess communication) <b>timed</b> cosimulation. The <b>optimistic</b> <b>timed</b> cosimulation algorithm optimistically estimates the time for synchronization between HW simulator and SW simulator and runs simulation through that time point. Because of optimistic estimation, it is possible for a simulator to run beyond the actual synchronization time point. In this case, it rolls back and re-executes the simulation. The proposed optimistic cosimulation algorithm minimizes the frequency of simulator synchronization at a negligible simulation time overhead due to rollback and re-execution. In non-IPC timed cosimulation, since IPC-based synchronization between HW simulator and SW simulator is not required, the synchronization overhead due to IPC is almost eliminated.

50|$|A key {{strategy}} {{used for}} selling United Kingdom land plots is {{to imply that}} because a customer owns the land plot, they cannot lose their money. The land banking company typically suggests dramatic annual increases {{in the value of}} the land plots, and a very <b>optimistic</b> <b>time</b> frame for successful planning applications. These are never contractually committed. Typically the land banking company sells a land plot at a premium of 15 to 100 times the current market value of undeveloped land. A purchaser might pay £15,000 for a land plot that only has a current market value of £500. On this basis, most of the investment is not in land, and the small percentage annual increases {{in the value of the}} land plot are meaningless. The actual investment is in a proposed service to deliver valuable approved building land in the future. If that service is never delivered or is not successful, the remaining land asset is normally worthless. Should the selling company fail or disappear, the plot owner cannot economically sell the plot, as the administrative effort and cost of sale typically exceeds the value of the land plot.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We present generic transformations, {{which allow}} to {{translate}} classic fault-tolerant distributed algorithms and their correctness proofs into a real-time {{distributed computing model}} (and vice versa). Owing to the non-zero-time, non-preemptible state transitions employed in our real-time model, scheduling and queuing effects (which are inherently abstracted away in classic zero step-time models, sometimes leading to overly <b>optimistic</b> <b>time</b> complexity results) can be accurately modeled. Our results thus make fault-tolerant distributed algorithms amenable to a sound real-time analysis, without sacrificing the wealth of algorithms and correctness proofs established in classic distributed computing re-search. By means of an example, we demonstrate that real-time algo-rithms generated by transforming classic algorithms can be competitive even w. r. t. optimal real-time algorithms, despite their comparatively sim-ple real-time analysis. ...|$|E

30|$|Through {{the metaphor}} of culture, a {{meaningful}} element of urban reality can be grasped. The SS Rotterdam was (and is) more than a ship, or now a hotel with conference facilities or a tourism attraction {{for the city of}} Rotterdam. It was experienced by Rotterdam’s citizens as an icon filled with emotional value. It was (and is) a symbol of the post war reconstruction of a city that was destroyed during WWII and experienced post war reconstruction. Indeed, Rotterdam’s citizens were proud to have the ship back. When the ship entered the harbour of Rotterdam to be anchored in 2008 (at that time the poor management of the project was already widely discussed in the media), thousands and thousands of people (including the author of this paper) stood on the quays to welcome the ship, some of the older generation men who had worked in the harbour, with tears in their eyes. Various books have been written on the SS Rotterdam. Pride, nostalgia, hope for the future of Katendrecht renovation area, were strong elements of the culture and served as an enactment of a shared reality. And it was more than popular pride and nostalgia in the <b>optimistic</b> <b>times</b> before the economic crisis, a period in which Rotterdam made progress in its urban redevelopment plans. With Porto, Rotterdam was selected as cultural capital of Europe in 2001 —and that was widely felt as recognition and a stimulus to go make next steps in realising the ambitions of the city. SS Rotterdam was conceived as a catalyst for urban redevelopment of Katendrecht area, which was a logical extension of the successful Kop van Zuid project.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. This article {{examines}} the repeated appearance of scenes showing the partial or complete destruction of New York City in American cinema of the Cold War. While this theme goes across genres, it has been particularly prevalent in science fiction films which {{are the focus of}} this study. It begins by showing the particular reasons for this morbid fascination and the history of such imagery in 19 th and early 20 th century literature and cinema. The paper then analyzes the changing presentations of destruction from the 1950 s to the 1980 s and relates them to the dominant fears and anxieties of each period. It concludes by taking a brief look at the continuation of the theme in the post-Cold War period. The destruction of New York City, in whole or in part, established itself as a frequent theme of American cinema during the Cold War, although it predates that conflict. 1 It goes across genres and has appeared in films considering political questions, the impact of technology, the effect of capitalism, the nature of power, urban living and war but is especially prevalent in science fiction. There are solid reasons for this. Science fiction, as a genre, is particularly suited to reflecting the political and social anxieties of its time especially as its main thematic focus often bears upon a grim future. Worries about current problems (as well as hopes for a better life) can be projected forward and exaggerated to show what might happen if things develop (or do not develop) in a particular way. In this manner a warning can be given or, in more <b>optimistic</b> <b>times,</b> people can ha l-...|$|R
