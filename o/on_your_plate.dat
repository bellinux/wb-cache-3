2500|$|Pro ranking {{points are}} similar to the National {{armateur}} points awards. [...] "A" [...] Pros get the equivalent of National Intermediate points. i.e. 120 for first, 100 points for second etc. [...] "AA" [...] Pro get Expert equivalent points i.e. 240 for first etc. Both like in the amateur classes get participant points if the racer makes the Main. The person with the most points in a season will be District Pro #1, the same is true to become state Pro #1. However, on the national level not only you must receive the most points, you must race in at least 10 nationals plus the Grand Nationals, the ABA's multi-day season ending event, for the best 10 of your finishes will go toward your national rankings.
