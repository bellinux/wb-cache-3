5|$|Like other {{cockatoos}}, {{this species}} is long-lived. A pair of yellow-tailed black cockatoos at Rotterdam Zoo stopped breeding {{when they were}} 41 and 37 years of age, but still showed signs of close bonding.

5|$|Males {{and females}} {{are similar in}} appearance. Juvenile birds are {{slightly}} browner than the adults, with buff or brown edges to the feathers of the wings and back.

5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{are famous}} for their song repertoires. Studies have shown that males sing songs at the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> season to attract females. Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males. The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season. Depending on the stage <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary his song production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male. Unmated males {{are also more likely}} to use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range. Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.|$|E

5|$|The time <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> {{depends on}} the {{elevation}} and latitude of the salamander's habitat.

5|$|Calls {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, {{including}} mate attraction, evaluation of potential mates, bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories, the identification of other individuals (such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> season), and the warning of other birds of potential predators, sometimes with specific information {{about the nature of the}} threat. Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication. The Coenocorypha snipes of New Zealand drive air through their feathers, woodpeckers drum territorially, and palm cockatoos use tools to drum.|$|E

5|$|Most tern {{species are}} declining in numbers {{due to the}} loss or {{disturbance}} <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> habitat, pollution and increased predation. Gull populations have increased {{over the last century}} because of reduced persecution and the availability of food from human activities, and terns have been forced out of many traditional nesting areas by the larger birds. A few species are defying the trend and showing local increases, including the Arctic tern in Scandinavia, Forster's tern around the Great Lakes, the Sandwich tern in eastern North America and its yellow-billed subspecies, the Cayenne tern, in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|On average, {{just over}} 50% <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> pairs are {{successful}} in producing at least one fledged young from a nest, with early breeding and low population density being factors increasing success. In the UK, more than 50% of the failures are due to predation and about 30% result from food shortages in bad weather. The annual survival rate is about 50% for adults and 26% for juveniles in their first year. The typical lifespan is two years, but a bird in Sweden lived to tenyears and twomonths Much greater ages, up to 24years, have been recorded in captive garden warblers.|$|E

5|$|The West Highland White Terrier, {{commonly}} known as the Westie is a breed of dog from Scotland with a distinctive white harsh coat with a somewhat soft white undercoat.
