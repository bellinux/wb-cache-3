5|$|Abul Ala {{was born}} in Maʿarra, modern Maarrat al-Nuʿman, Syria, {{near the city of}} Aleppo, in December 973. At his time, the city was part of the Abbasid Caliphate, the third Islamic caliphate, and was during the Golden Age of Islam. He {{was a member of the}} Banu Sulayman, a notable family of Maʿarra, {{belonging}} to the larger Tanukh tribe. One <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ancestors</b> was probably the first qadi of Maʿarra. The Tanukh tribe had formed part of the aristocracy in Syria for hundreds of years and some members of the Banu Sulayman had also been noted as good poets.|$|E

5|$|Hoàng Cao Khải, the French-installed viceroy of Tonkin, {{perceived}} Phan's {{intent to}} a degree that his French masters did not. Khai was from a scholar-gentry family from the same village as Phan. He became the main backer of a determined effort to crush Phan's forces, using every means available: political, psychological and economic. By late 1894, relatives and suspected sympathisers of the insurgents were intimidated and more resistance commanders had been killed. Communications were disrupted, and the rebel hideouts became increasingly insecure. In an attempt to force Phan to surrender, the French arrested his family and desecrated the tombs <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ancestors,</b> publicly displaying the remains in Hà Tĩnh.|$|E

On the other hand, Sultan Ali had expressed his wish to the governor that the Kesang territory (around Muar) should be directly governed by him, citing reasons that some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ancestors</b> were buried there. The British persuaded the Temenggong to concede to Sultan Ali's request and accepted after much consideration.|$|E

5|$|According to Pfälzner, a final burial stage can be noticed, {{which he}} calls the {{quaternary}} burial. Tomb VII, which most probably contained remains {{taken out of the}} royal hypogeum, seems to have worked as a storage for the remains of individuals whose Kispu cycle came to an end; very few bowls were found in that tomb. The Kispu was important for demonstrating the legitimacy of the king, thus it needed to be public and visible to a large crowd; Pfälzner suggests that hall A in the royal palace was the place for the public Kispu and that the antechamber of the royal hypogeum was dedicated for private Kispu that included only the king and the spirits <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ancestors.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the child's {{father was}} allowed to visit him during August and September 1858, two starkly {{different}} narratives emerged—one told of a boy who wanted {{to return to his}} family and the faith <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ancestors,</b> while the other described a child who had learned the catechism perfectly and wanted his parents to become Christians as well. International protests mounted, but the Pope would not be moved. After pontifical rule in Bologna ended in 1859, Father Feletti was prosecuted for his role in Mortara's seizure, but was acquitted when the court decided he had simply followed orders. With the Pope as a substitute father, Mortara trained for the priesthood in Rome until the Kingdom of Italy captured the city in 1870, ending the Papal States. Leaving the country, he was ordained in France three years later at the age of 21. Father Mortara {{spent most of his life}} outside Italy and died in Belgium in 1940, aged 88.|$|E
5|$|Baron Yamaki (Sessue Hayakawa) is a {{fisherman}} who lives {{along with his}} daughter Toya San (Tsuru Aoki) on an island. The island is inhabited by Buddhists and Yamaki had been cursed by Buddha for an affront by one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ancestors</b> who in a murderous rage, defiled an altar of Buddha in the nearby temple. The curse was that if his daughter married anyone, then the nearby volcano would erupt. Toya finds it difficult to form relationships with boys because the village prophet Takeo (Thomas Kurihara) has spread the rumour that she is cursed. She is therefore unwilling to continue her father's acceptance of the curse. When Yamaki takes Toya-san to the Buddha shrine {{in the garden of}} his house to pray and try to get the curse removed, she vents her feelings about the god's unfairness.|$|E

His grandfather was John Fownes (1661-1731) of Kittery Court in the parish of Kingswear and of Nethway in the parish of Brixham, both in Devon, a Member of Parliament for Dartmouth, Devon, in 1713-14. The first <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ancestors</b> to settle in Devon was Thomas Fones (died 1638) of Plymouth in Devon, a merchant who served as Mayor of Plymouth in 1619, whose ancestors were from Bromsgrove in Worcestershire and in 1539 had acquired Dodford Priory shortly after the Dissolution of the Monasteries.|$|E
5|$|Moelia and {{his family}} depart for Ciwalirang the {{following}} morning, hoping that Noesa Brama will consent to the marriage of Moelia and Retna Sari. The priest accepts the proposal, but expresses regret over {{the destruction of the}} statue after he discovers that Retna Sari and Soerijati had not gone willingly with the men from Palembang. He weds Moelia and Retna Sari and has them promise that their first son will be raised a Hindu and become king of the Baduy; he then surrenders all his power to his daughter. Later, hoping that his spirit and those <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ancestors</b> can control the volcano, Noesa Brama secretly commits suicide by jumping into the well. Several weeks later, activity at the volcano drops, although it remains active.|$|E
5|$|Sir Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood, 1st Baronet, (9 May 1801– 12 April 1866) was an English landowner, {{developer}} and Member of Parliament, {{who founded the}} town of Fleetwood, in Lancashire, England. Born Peter Hesketh, he changed his name by Royal assent to Hesketh-Fleetwood, incorporating the name <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ancestors,</b> and was later created Baronet Fleetwood. Predeceased by an older brother, he inherited estates in west Lancashire in 1824. Inspired by the transport developments of the early 19th century, he decided to bring the railway to the Lancashire coast and develop a holiday resort and port. He hired architect Decimus Burton to design his new town, which he named Fleetwood; construction began in 1836. Hesketh-Fleetwood {{was instrumental in the}} formation of the Preston and Wyre Railway Company and with his financial support, a railway line was built between Preston and Fleetwood which opened in 1840.|$|E

50|$|Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Hughes {{held that}} whether the {{petitioner}} would receive any property {{in his capacity}} as heir depended upon the validity <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ancestor's</b> will {{and the extent to which}} it would dispose <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ancestor's</b> estate. When, by compromise and the decree enforcing it, that disposition was limited, what he got from the estate came to him because he was heir, the compromise serving to remove pro tanto the impediment to his inheritance. As such, the exemption applies.|$|R

5|$|The Heskeths' first child, Anna Maria (known as Maria to {{distinguish}} her from three close relatives named Anna), {{was born in}} 1827. Three more children—named Metcalfe Bold, Debonnaire and Frances—all died in infancy. In 1831 Hesketh changed his name by royal licence to Hesketh-Fleetwood, incorporating the better-known family name <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ancestors</b> into his own. Debonnaire contracted tuberculosis and died in early 1833. Shortly before Debonnaire's death Hesketh-Fleetwood contracted scarlet fever. This was followed by erysipelas, a bacterial infection so severe that it necessitated the removal {{of one of his}} eyes. At the end of the year, the Rossall estate was severely flooded and suffered damage costing about £3,000 to repair. Hesketh-Fleetwood subsequently spent very little time at Rossall.|$|E
5|$|When {{the legendary}} donor Karna {{died in the}} epic Mahabharata war, his soul transcended to heaven, where he was offered gold and jewels as food. However, Karna needed real food to eat and asked Indra, the lord of heaven, the reason for serving gold as food. Indra told Karna that he had donated gold all his life, but had never donated food to his {{ancestors}} in Shraddha. Karna said that since he was unaware <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ancestors,</b> he never donated anything in their memory. To make amends, Karna was permitted to return to earth for a 15–day period, {{so that he could}} perform Shraddha and donate food and water in their memory. This period is now known as Pitru Paksha. In some legends, Yama replaces Indra.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the Cliffords began {{spending}} more time at their other castles, particularly Skipton Castle in Yorkshire. Brougham descended through several generations of Cliffords, intermittently serving as a residence. However, by 1592, {{it was in a}} state of disrepair, as George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland was {{spending more}} time in southern England due to his role as Queen's Champion. The castle was briefly restored in the early 17th century, to such an extent, that King James I of England was entertained there in 1617. In 1643, Lady Anne Clifford inherited the estates, including the castles of Brougham, Appleby, and Brough, and set about restoring them. Brougham Castle was kept in good condition for a short time, after Lady Anne's death in 1676; however, Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet, who had inherited the Clifford estates, sold the furnishings in 1714. The empty shell was left to decay, as it was too costly to maintain. As a ruin, Brougham Castle inspired a painting by J. M. W. Turner, and was mentioned at the start of William Wordsworth's poem The Prelude, as well as becoming the subject of Wordsworth's Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle upon the Restoration of Lord Clifford, the Shepherd, to the Estates and Honours <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>Ancestors.</b> The castle was left to the Ministry of Works, in the 1930s, and is today maintained by its successor, English Heritage.|$|E
