5|$|After the Treaties of Tilsit of July 1807 Metternich {{saw that}} Austria's {{position}} in Europe {{was much more}} vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last. In the meantime he found the new French Foreign Minister, Jean-Baptiste Champagny unaccommodating and struggled to negotiate a satisfactory settlement <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of several French forts on the River Inn. Over the following months the reach of Austrian policy, and Metternich's own reputation, increased. Metternich pushed for a Russo-Austrian alliance, though Tsar Alexander was too preoccupied with the three other wars he was engaged in to commit. Over time, Metternich came to see an eventual war with France as inevitable.|$|E
5|$|At the Potsdam Conference, {{which started}} in late July after Germany's surrender, serious {{differences}} emerged <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> development of Germany {{and the rest of}} Central and Eastern Europe. Moreover, the participants' mounting antipathy and bellicose language served to confirm their suspicions about each other's hostile intentions and entrench their positions.

5|$|These {{changes were}} {{embodied}} in the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, which passed the Commons with little opposition save for a dispute <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> status of Militia regiments. It essentially abolished the existing Volunteers and Yeomanry, and used them {{to create a new}} Territorial Force of fourteen infantry divisions, fourteen cavalry brigades, and a large number of support units, all raised, organised and financed by local organisations but liable for service under War Office command. The Militia provided the Special Reserve, which would contain men who had not served in the regular Army but agreed to be liable for service with the regular forces in wartime.|$|E

The company won the contract by strengthening the marketing and advertising program ties between Burger King and itself. The contract lasted three more years when, partially based upon Pepsi's growth as a restaurant operator with its Tricon Restaurants division, Burger King moved its beverage contract back to Coca-Cola.|$|E

5|$|As CGDK chairperson, Sihanouk unsuccessfully negotiated, {{over the}} next five years, with the Chinese {{government}} to broker a political settlement to end the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. During this period, Sihanouk appointed two of his sons, Norodom Chakrapong and Norodom Ranariddh, to lead the ANS. Chakrapong was appointed as the deputy chief-of-staff for the ANS in March 1985, while Ranariddh was minted to the twin positions of commander-in-chief and the chief-of-staff of the ANS in January 1986, replacing Tam. In December 1987 the Prime Minister of the PRK government, Hun Sen, first met with Sihanouk to discuss ending the protracted Cambodian–Vietnamese War. The following July, the then-foreign minister of Indonesia, Ali Alatas, brokered the first round of meetings between the four warring Cambodian factions consisting of FUNCINPEC, Khmer Rouge, KPNLF, and the PRK government <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of Cambodia. Two more rounds of meetings were held in February and May 1989; since all were held near Jakarta, they became known as the Jakarta Informal Meetings (JIM).|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{policies}} in Chongqing ultimately {{made him a}} prominent figure among neo-Maoists and leftists, and {{a representative of the}} conservative wing of the Communist Party. Although Bo did not favor the discontinuation of market economics or a return to Mao-era policies, he was seen to advocate a strong role for the state in peoples' lives. Bo's anti-corruption campaign, in particular, earned him a reputation for heavy-handedness and authoritarian methods in crime and punishment. Bo's policies put him in opposition to the more liberal and reform-oriented faction, particularly Premier Wen Jiabao and Guangdong party chief Wang Yang, who favored the strengthening of rule of law and a continuation of political reform. To observers, Bo and Wang's verbal jousting <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> direction of development marked an increasing polarization of Chinese politics into leftist and reformer camps.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{there was}} {{considerable}} debate <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of the pipelines. The major oil companies, such as Standard Oil, campaigned for the conversion of the pipelines for the transfer of natural gas. Demand for natural gas was rising rapidly, and it was produced in large quantities in the Texas oilfields, but could not be got to market in the north-east and was otherwise burnt off uselessly into the atmosphere. The railroad and coal companies, who saw this as likely to introduce additional competition for coal and coal gas, and therefore lower demand for their goods and services, argued against this move. The smaller oil companies proposed continuing to use the pipelines for oil in order to undermine the transport monopolies of the larger corporations.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} four weeks, while the ship was dry-docked, Bruce negotiated with the Argentine government <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of the weather station. He was assisted by the British resident minister, the British Consul, and Dr W. G. Davis who {{was director of the}} Argentine Meteorological Office. When contacted by cable, the British Foreign Office registered no objection to this scheme. On 20 January 1904, Bruce confirmed an agreement whereby three scientific assistants of the Argentine government would travel back to Laurie Island to work for a year, under Robert Mossman, as the first stage of an annual arrangement. He then formally handed over the Omond House building, its furnishings and provisions, and all magnetic and meteorological instruments, to the Argentine government. The station, renamed Orcadas Base, has remained operational ever since, having been rebuilt and extended several times.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the right-wing}} Jörg Haider {{took over the}} {{leadership}} of the FPÖ's significant Carinthia branch. Its importance dated to the Kärntner Abwehrkampf (Carinthian defensive struggle) following World War I, and subsequent anti-Slavic sentiment arising from a fear of being taken over by Yugoslavia. Encouraged by the mass media, a struggle soon developed between Steger and Haider <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of the party. In the 1985 Reder case, for instance, Haider staunchly supported FPÖ Minister of Defence Friedhelm Frischenschlager when the latter welcomed convicted Waffen-SS war criminal Walter Reder in person when Reder arrived at Graz Airport after his release from Italy. While the FPÖ struggled with its low support at the national level in the mid-1980s, this was {{in sharp contrast to the}} party's position in Haider's Carinthia (where the party had increased its support from 11.7% in the 1979 provincial election to 16% in 1984).|$|E
5|$|It {{would take}} until 1982 before serious {{consideration}} {{was given to}} any expressway plan. While most of the planned 1963 routes had vanished from the drawing board, a north–south link through the Red Hill Valley Creek and an east–west route along the brow of the escarpment remained in place. An environmental assessment of both links began and was approved in 1985. However, expressway opponents launched {{an appeal to the}} provincial cabinet. This appeal was rejected in 1987, and engineering began. Preliminary designs were submitted to the Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth and approved in April 1990. Construction began immediately on structures to carry three routes (two road and one rail) <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> Red Hill Valley Parkway.|$|E

5|$|Sultan Khalifah sent Zanzibari troops led by Brigadier-General Lloyd Mathews, {{a former}} Lieutenant of the Royal Navy, {{to restore order}} in Tanganyika. The {{operation}} was largely successful, but anti-German feeling among the Zanzibari people remained strong. Further conflicts erupted at Bagamoyo, where 150 natives were killed by German military forces, and at Ketwa, where German officials and their servants were murdered. Khalifah then granted extensive trade rights to the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC) who, with German assistance, ran a naval blockade to halt the continuing domestic slave trade. Upon Khalifah's death in 1890 Ali bin Said ascended to the sultanate. Sultan Ali banned the domestic slave trade (but not slave ownership), declared Zanzibar a British protectorate and appointed Lloyd Mathews as First Minister to lead his cabinet. The British were also guaranteed a veto <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> appointment of sultans.|$|E
5|$|West Virginia {{also enjoyed}} a long-standing rivalry with the Syracuse Orange. The schools have competed {{annually}} from 1955-2012, with the 1993 {{addition of the}} Ben Schwartzwalder Trophy being awarded to the victor. The significance of the trophy resides {{in the fact that}} Ben Schwartzwalder was a West Virginia native, former WVU player, and legendary head coach at Syracuse. While Syracuse holds a 33–27 lead in the series, WVU has won eight of the last ten games between the schools. Much like the status of the Backyard Brawl, Syracuse's departure from the Big East for the Atlantic Coast Conference and WVU's joining of the Big 12 Conference casts doubt <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of the series.|$|E
