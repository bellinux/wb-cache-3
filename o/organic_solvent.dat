30|$|There {{are several}} factors {{responsible}} {{for the effects of}} <b>organic</b> <b>solvents.</b> The <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> mostly cause denaturation of proteins mainly due to the disruption of intra non-covalent interactions. In other cases, <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> can act either as an inhibitor or a substrate itself rendering competitive inhibition or substrate inhibition. <b>Organic</b> <b>solvents</b> can interrupt intra-molecular hydrogen bonding that stabilizes the tertiary structure of any proteins. Apart from that, the <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> change the physical properties such as dielectric constant, polarity, and hydrophobicity. This change affects the solvation of substrate and/or transition states, and hence interferes with their binding to enzyme molecule (Mozhaev et al. 1989).|$|R

5|$|Direct {{precipitation}} {{of sodium}} salts from aqueous solutions is rare because sodium salts typically {{have a high}} affinity for water; an exception is sodium bismuthate (NaBiO3). Because of this, sodium salts are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with an <b>organic</b> <b>solvent,</b> such as ethanol; for example, only 0.35g/L of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol. Crown ethers, like 15-crown-5, {{may be used as}} a phase-transfer catalyst.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{development}} of model membranes confirmed that the lipid bilayer is a stable structure that can exist independent of proteins. By “painting” a solution of lipid in <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> across an aperture, Mueller and Rudin were able to create an artificial bilayer and determine that this exhibited lateral fluidity, high electrical resistance and self-healing in response to puncture, all of which are properties of a natural cell membrane. A few years later, Alec Bangham showed that bilayers, in the form of lipid vesicles, could also be formed simply by exposing a dried lipid sample to water. This was an important advance, since it demonstrated that lipid bilayers form spontaneously via self assembly and do not require a patterned support structure.|$|E
5|$|To furnish a {{functional}} oligonucleotide, all the protecting groups {{have to be}} removed. The N-acyl base protection and the 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection may be, and is often removed simultaneously by treatment with inorganic bases or amines. However, the applicability of this method {{is limited by the}} fact that the cleavage of 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection gives rise to acrylonitrile as a side product. Under the strong basic conditions required for the removal of N-acyl protection, acrylonitrile is capable of alkylation of nucleic bases, primarily, at the N3-position of thymine and uracil residues to give the respective N3-(2-cyanoethyl) adducts via Michael reaction. The formation of these side products may be avoided by treating the solid support-bound oligonucleotides with solutions of bases in an <b>organic</b> <b>solvent,</b> for instance, with 50% triethylamine in acetonitrile or 10% diethylamine in acetonitrile. This treatment is strongly recommended for medium- and large scale preparations and is optional for syntheses on small scale where the concentration of acrylonitrile generated in the deprotection mixture is low.|$|E

The man was a 58 year old sign writer with lifelong exposure to a mixture of <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> (mainly cyclohexanone, white spirit, and isopropanol). Epileptic seizures of temporal type were occurring in relation to solvent exposure. The seizures disappeared shortly after stopping exposure but returned just after a short term re-exposure to cyclohexanone.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Nowadays, {{some studies}} {{indicate}} {{the adverse effects}} of exposure to chemicals, especially <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> on the reproductive system of females. This study aimed to assess the relationship between spontaneous abortion with occupational exposure to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> in pharmaceutical industry. Materials & Methods: This is a cross-sectional and descriptive-analytical study which {{was carried out in}} 2010 in one of the pharmaceutical factories located in the suburbs of Tehran. During the study, married women who were working in the factory laboratory units and were exposed to mixed <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> were compared with married women who were working in the packing units of the factory without occupational exposure to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents.</b> Frequency of spontaneous abortion and duration of pregnancy were assessed in both two groups. Collected data were analyzed with the SPSS software using t-test, logistic regression, and chi-square test. Results: In the present study, the frequency of spontaneous abortion in employees with exposure to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> mixture was 10. 7 %. This study showed that even after adjustment for confounding factors, there was a significant correlation between spontaneous abortion and occupational exposure to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> mixture and this correlation increased with increasing levels of exposure to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents.</b> Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between occupational exposure to mixed <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> and waiting time to become pregnant (TTP). Furthermore, this study showed that even after adjustment for confounding variables, shift workers were significantly more affected by spontaneous abortion compared to daytime workers (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: According to the results of this study, since there is probability of spontaneous abortion resulting from occupational exposure to various chemicals including <b>organic</b> <b>solvents,</b> review of the status of occupational exposure of workers can be helpful in improving the reproductive health of female workers...|$|R
25|$|An {{instance}} of ion-pair extraction {{is in the}} use of a ligand to enable oxidation by potassium permanganate, KMnO4, in an <b>organic</b> <b>solvent.</b> KMnO4 is not soluble in organic solvents.

25|$|Another {{example of}} this is the {{synthesis}} of benzoic acid from phenylmagnesium bromide and dry ice. Benzoic acid is more soluble in an <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> such as dichloromethane or diethyl ether, and when shaken with this <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> in a separatory funnel, will preferentially dissolve in the organic layer. The other reaction products, including the magnesium bromide, will remain in the aqueous layer, clearly showing that separation based on solubility is achieved. This process, known as liquid–liquid extraction, is an important technique in synthetic chemistry. Recycling is used to ensure maximum extraction.|$|E
40|$|There is a {{necessity}} for portable and relatively cheap device {{which could be used}} for rapid, reversible and in-situ volatile organic compound detection. We offer a polyisoprene-nanostructured carbon composite (PNCC) us a promising material for <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour detection and identification in the environment. Previously obtained experimental results verify that PNCC can distinguish 10 different <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> saturated vapour. When PNCC is exposed to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour, molecules of vapour adsorbe {{on the surface of the}} composite and diffuse into matrix material. At the same time decreases the tunnelling currents between carbon aggregates in thin layers of matrix and the electrical resistance of the composite increases. In the presence of <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour electric resistance changes remarkably in short time (30 s) and the effect is reversible. The largest electric resistance change velocity (vR) is observed for tetrahydrofuran (0, 19404 KΩ/min), benzene (0, 13082 KΩ/min) and ethylacetate (0, 10694 KΩ/min) vapour. But nearly no vR change is observed, when PNCC is exposed to propanol vapour (0, 004028 KΩ/min). We relate this variant electric resistance response of PNCC to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour variant compatibility with the composites matrix material (polyisoprene) and variant <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour molecule dimensions. To evaluate vapour compatibility with the composite matrix material we compared dielectric permeability values of vapour (εv) and polyisoprene (εp). We observed that larger vR change is reached when εv value is close to εp (2, 68) value. PNCC <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour sensitivity is selective. The composite does not respond or respond weakly to polar <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour presence. Also in the electric resistance response evaluation of PNCC molecule dimensions of <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour should be taken into account. As smaller the diameter of vapour and better compatibility with matrix material us greater electric resistance response of PNCC is observed...|$|R

30|$|To {{clarify the}} role of lignin in the affinities of acetylated wood for <b>organic</b> <b>solvents,</b> the effects of {{delignification}} on the solvent adsorption of acetylated wood were investigated. Acetylated wood meals rapidly adsorbed <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> that were hardly adsorbed by unmodified wood. For nonpolar and low-polarity <b>organic</b> <b>solvents,</b> a clear positive correlation was observed {{between the amount of}} adsorption and the lignin content. This indicated that acetylated lignin was responsible for the excellent affinities of acetylated wood for hydrophobic <b>organic</b> <b>solvents.</b> On the other hand, for lower alcohols and water, the amount of adsorption reduced with an increase in the lignin content. It was suggested that the adsorption of such polar solvents was dominated by insufficiently acetylated hydrophilic polysaccharides.|$|R
