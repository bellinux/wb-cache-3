5|$|Jesus is {{considered}} {{the first person to}} receive the baptism with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit descended <b>on</b> <b>Jesus</b> during his baptism and anointed him with power. Afterward, Jesus began his ministry and displayed his power by casting out demons, healing the sick, and teaching with authority.|$|E

5000|$|Typically, {{the only}} apostles easily {{identifiable}} are Judas, often with his bag containing thirty pieces of silver visible, John the Evangelist, normally placed <b>on</b> <b>Jesus's</b> right side, usually [...] "reclining in Jesus' bosom" [...] as his Gospel says (see below), or even asleep, and Saint Peter <b>on</b> <b>Jesus's</b> left. The {{food on the}} table often includes a paschal lamb; in Late Antique and Byzantine versions fish was the main dish. In later works the bread may become more like a communion host, and more food, eating, and figures of servers appear.|$|R

50|$|The New Finnish Interpretation {{has been}} {{challenged}} because it downplays Luther's roots in key theological developments in Western Christendom, and it characterizes Luther's teaching on Justification as based <b>on</b> <b>Jesus's</b> righteousness which indwells the believer rather than Jesus's righteousness as imputed to the believer.|$|R

25|$|The {{betrayal}} of Jesus {{by one of}} his disciples is widely regarded by scholars as authentic, based on the criterion of embarrassment: it is considered unlikely that the early church would have invented this tradition, since it appears to reflect badly <b>on</b> <b>Jesus.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Hungarian {{psychologist}} Péter Popper wrote a {{novel in}} 1997 Peloni or the Testament of Pilate in which Pilate portrays {{himself as a}} cultivated Roman bewildered by Judea and the Jews.

25|$|Christian rock {{is a form}} of {{rock music}} that {{features}} lyrics focusing on matters of Christian faith, often with an emphasis <b>on</b> <b>Jesus,</b> typically performed by self-proclaimed Christian individuals. The extent to which their lyrics are explicitly Christian varies between bands. Many bands who perform Christian rock have ties to the contemporary Christian music labels, media outlets, and festivals, while other bands are independent.|$|E
25|$|The main {{arguments}} from the mythicists are {{the lack of}} biographical information <b>on</b> <b>Jesus</b> from early Christian and non-Christian sources, the so-called argument from silence and the mythical and allegorical nature of the Christ of Paul and the Jesus of the Gospels. They further note that the Gospels are a composite of various strands of thought and note the similarities of early Christianity and the Christ figure with contemporary mystery religions.|$|E

25|$|Following the Public Libraries Act 1850 the city's {{first public}} library, located <b>on</b> <b>Jesus</b> Lane, was opened in 1855. It {{was moved to}} the Guildhall in 1862, and is now located in the Grand Arcade {{shopping}} centre. The library was reopened in September 2009, after having been closed for refurbishment for 33 months, more than twice as long as was forecast when the library closed for redevelopment in January 2007.|$|E
25|$|Debaters {{have often}} alleged {{a number of}} {{parallels}} between Krishnaism and Christianity, originating with Kersey Graves' The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors claiming 346 parallels between Krishna and Jesus, theorizing that Christianity emerged {{as a result of}} an import of pagan concepts upon Judaism. Some 19th- to early 20th-century scholars writing <b>on</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ in comparative mythology (John M. Robertson, Christianity and Mythology, 1910) even sought to derive both traditions from a common predecessor religion.|$|E
25|$|Up to the 1890s most Seventh-day Adventists were anti-Trinitarian. They viewed God the Father as God {{in every}} way, the Son as divine but begotten {{and having a}} beginning, and the Holy Spirit reduced to merely a manifestation of either the Father or the Son. The 1888 Conference and the preaching of A. T. Jones and E. J. Waggoner brought a focus of the biblical {{doctrine}} of the Godhead {{in part because of}} the emphasis <b>on</b> <b>Jesus</b> and the plan of salvation as presented after 1888.|$|E
50|$|Mary {{also appears}} in Sura 3, {{where she and}} her story are closely {{connected}} to that of her guardian, the prophet Zakariyya. The angel's words about the birth of John to Zakariyya (Sura 3:39) are almost identical to those <b>on</b> <b>Jesus's</b> (Sura 3:45). Similarly, both respond by questioning the message (Sura 3:40;47) and receive the same answer.|$|R

25|$|Reported {{cases of}} stigmata take various forms. Many show {{some or all}} of five Holy Wounds that were, {{according}} to the Bible, inflicted <b>on</b> <b>Jesus</b> during his crucifixion: wounds in the wrists and feet, from nails; and in the side, from a lance. Some stigmatics display wounds to the forehead similar to those caused by the Crown of Thorns. Stigmata as crown of thorns appearing in the 20th century, e.g. on Marie Rose Ferron, have been repeatedly photographed. Other reported forms include tears of blood or sweating blood, and wounds to the back as from scourging.|$|E
25|$|The main {{arguments}} from the mythicists are {{the lack of}} biographical information <b>on</b> <b>Jesus</b> from early Christian and other sources, the so called argument from silence, {{as well as the}} mythical and allegorical nature of the Christ of Paul and the Jesus of the Gospels. Most Christ mythicists agree that the evidence for the existence of a historical Jesus Christ is weak at best, pointing at a series of perceived peculiarities in the sources which they regard as untrustworthy for a historical account and noting the reliance on Jewish writings and the similarities of early Christianity and the Christ figure with the mystery religions of the Greco-Roman world.|$|E
25|$|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) focuses its {{doctrine}} and teaching <b>on</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ; {{that he was}} the Son of God, born of Mary, lived a perfect life, performed miracles, bled from every pore in the Garden of Gethsemane, died on the cross, rose on the third day, appeared again to his disciples, and now resides, authoritatively, on the right hand side of God. In brief, some beliefs are in common with Catholics, Orthodox and Protestant traditions. However, teachings of the LDS Church differ significantly in other ways and encompass a broad set of doctrines, so that the above-mentioned denominations usually place the LDS Church outside the bounds of orthodox Christian teaching as summarized in the Nicene Creed.|$|E

25|$|The idea of {{expanding}} Siegfried's Tod {{into a series}} of two or more operas would have been particularly appealing to Wagner, as he had now come to realize that {{it would be impossible to}} say all that he wanted to in a single opera without an inordinate number of digressions. The political events of the past few years and his recent discovery of the philosophy of Ludwig Feuerbach had greatly enlarged the scope of ideas which he hoped to explore in his new opera. He also wished to incorporate various ideas that he had been mulling over in the works <b>on</b> <b>Jesus,</b> Frederick, Achilles and Wieland (all four of which had been effectively abandoned by now). These ideas ranged over the politics of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail Bakunin and the philosophy of Hegel and the Young Hegelians.|$|E
25|$|The {{river was}} {{sufficiently}} profitable that the Conservators {{were able to}} contribute £400 towards the cost of rebuilding the Great Bridge, now called the Magdalene Bridge, in 1823, and a further £300 for the rebuilding of the Small Bridge, now Silver Street Bridge, in 1841. A year later they constructed a house at Clayhithe, which cost £880, and included a large room for meetings and banquets. Just three years later the Eastern Counties Railway reached Cambridge, and the navigation declined rapidly. Receipts dropped from £1,393 in 1846 to £367 in 1850, and were just £99 in 1898. Most commercial carrying on the river had stopped by World War I, although Banhams operated two steam tugs and three barges until the late 1930s, carrying gas water from Cambridge Gasworks to King's Lynn, where it {{was used in the}} manufacture of fertiliser. The last recorded passenger services had ceased nearly 100 years earlier, in 1839 and were started again in 2008 with the passenger vessel moored <b>on</b> <b>Jesus</b> Green.|$|E
25|$|The first mention {{related to}} the history of the {{religion}} known in South Carolina was in a newspaper article. It was published in June 1865 in The Daily Phoenix of Columbia, South Carolina, on the front page, reviewing events that occurred from 1844–1850 or so. The source of the extended quote is not named, and makes mistakes typical of the period. See also Josephus <b>on</b> <b>Jesus.</b> It was originally presented in an article in The Literary World of June 14, 1851, as a letter dated February 10, 1851, by Dr. Rev. Austin H. Wright to the American Oriental Society. It was subsequently also published in a newspaper June 26, 1851, and was published in a German newspaper in 1851 translated by his superior, Rev. Justin Perkins. Wright, father of Lucy Myers Wright Mitchell and John Henry Wright, was a medical missionary from New England, and gained his medical degree in Virginia. Wright {{was the first person to}} write a paper giving an account on Bábism, and died in what was then called Urumiah, Persia, January 14, 1865. The Daily Phoenix itself began publication March 1865 after Sherman's March to the Sea that burned a third of the city or more and by April was being published as a daily paper. Julian A. Shelby, the newspaper publisher, lived to 1907.|$|E
