[...] "The fact that I haven't missed a week in over six years is quite an incentive not to miss a week." [...] Each live show is about 90 to 120 minutes long. Steve has to cut that down to about one hour 15 minutes for the broadcast show, and then get it down to exactly one hour for the XM show. He wonders what version people like more, the one hour version is much tighter but he has to cut out a lot of the banter and humor, while the 80 minute podcast show has much more personality.|$|E
