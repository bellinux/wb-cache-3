5|$|Prefixes {{are added}} to unit names to produce {{multiple}} and sub-multiples of the original unit. All multiples are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand.</b> For example, kilo- denotes a multiple <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> and milli- denotes a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a micrometre, not a millimillimetre. Multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit, so a millionth of a kilogram is a milligram, not a microkilogram.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{during her}} reign, Anne {{and her husband}} spent the winter at Kensington and St James's Palaces, and the summer at Windsor Castle or Hampton Court Palace, where the air was fresher. George had {{recurrent}} asthma, and the cleaner air in the country was better for his breathing. They visited the spa town of Bath, Somerset, in mid-1702, {{on the advice of}} George's doctors, and again in mid-1703. They occasionally visited Newmarket, Suffolk, to view the horse racing. On one visit, Anne bought George a horse, Leeds, for the vast sum <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> guineas.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 1October Valckenier {{received}} reports that a crowd <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> Chinese had gathered outside the gate, angered by his statements at the emergency meeting five days earlier. This report was received incredulously by Valckenier and the council. However, after {{the murder of a}} Balinese sergeant by the Chinese outside the walls, the council decided to take extraordinary measures and reinforce the guard. Two groups of 50 Europeans and some native porters were sent to outposts on the south and east sides of the city, and a plan of attack was formulated.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{scholars}} have emphasised, {{in the words}} of Ármann Jakobsson, that:the time has come to resist reviewing information about álfar en masse and trying to impose generalizations on a tradition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> years. Legends of álfar may have been constantly changing and were perhaps always heterogeneous so it might be argued that any particular source will only reflect the state of affairs at one given time.Thus, elves have had a place both within and outside Germanic-speaking Christian cultures.|$|E

5|$|Standing {{over his}} vanquished opponent, Carrouges {{remained}} on the field as the crowd cheered him and pages rushed to bind his wound. He then kneeled before the King, who presented him with a prize <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> francs {{in addition to a}} royal income of 200 francs a year. Only then did he greet his wife, in an emotional scene before the thousands of spectators. Jean and Marguerite de Carrouges then, with the crowd following in a great procession, rode from the abbey to the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris, to give thanks for the victory.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the start}} of a massive {{armament}} programme that would consume more than a billion francs over the next ten years, but after Hitler's rise to power in Nazi Germany, the Social Democrats added their support to the efforts. They also supported Gottlieb Duttweiler's 1938popular initiative calling for the purchase <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> aircraft and the training of three thousand pilots. After 92,000citizens signed in support, nearly twice the number necessary for a national popular vote, the federal government offered a referendum proposal in 1939that was nearly as extensive, which was accepted by a 69percent majority.|$|E
5|$|Bristol {{was made}} a city in 1542, with the former Abbey of St Augustine {{becoming}} Bristol Cathedral, following the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII. The Dissolution also saw the surrender to the king of all of Bristol's friaries and monastic hospitals, together with StJames' Priory, StMary Magdalen nunnery, a Cistercian abbey at Kingswood and the College at Westbury on Trym. In {{the case of the}} friaries at Greyfriars and Whitefriars, the priors had fled before the arrival of the royal commissioners, and at Whitefriars a succession of departing priors had plundered the friary of its valuables. Although the commissioners {{had not been able to}} point to as much religious malpractice in Bristol as elsewhere, there is no record of Bristolians raising any objections to the royal seizures. In 1541 Bristol's civic leaders took the opportunity of buying up lands and properties formerly belonging to StMark's Hospital, StMary Magdalen, Greyfriars and Whitefriars for a total <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> pounds. Bristol thereby became the only municipality in the country which has its own chapel, at StMark's.|$|E
5|$|French chemist Bernard Courtois {{discovered}} Iodine in 1811, and in 1896 Eugen Baumann documented it as {{the central}} ingredient in the thryoid gland. He did this by boiling the thyroid glands <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> sheep, and named the precipitate, {{a combination of the}} thyroid hormones, 'iodothyrin'. David Marine in 1907 provided iodine is necessary for thyroid function. Thyroxine itself was first isolated in 1914 and synthesized in 1927, and trirodothyroxine in 1952. The conversion of T4 to T3 was discovered in 1970. The process of discovering TSH took place over the early to mid twentieth century. TRH was discovered by Polish endocrinologist Andrew Schally in 1970, contributing in part to his Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1977.|$|E

5|$|From 2012–3, Smith {{performed}} {{several times}} with the International Harp Ensemble, a Surrey-based group of harpists who produce {{a variety of different}} styles of harp music, including appearing with the group on a September episode of Songs of Praise. She also guest-featured on the group's 2012 album The Magic <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Thousand</b> Strings, singing on five tracks. Further shows with the International Harp Ensemble were planned into 2014. While working with the International Harp Ensemble, Smith began training with vocal coach Joy Mammen, who also teaches Lesley Garrett, as well as learning German and Italian, with the intention of moving from classical crossover towards opera. She continued to perform publicly in 2015, singing at Wembley again in August.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, {{during the}} War of the First Coalition, Ernouf {{was sent to}} Cassel to {{strengthen}} the French position. The Duke of York laid siege to Dunkirk and blockaded the town of Bergues, on the Belgian border, which had insufficient garrison {{to fend off the}} British. Ernouf assembled a force <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> men and joined Jean Nicolas Houchard; together they marched to the relief of Dunkirk. Once there, he led a column in attack on the British camp. On 5 complémentaire an I (21September 1793), which would have been {{the last day of the}} first year of the new Republic, he was raised to the rank of Brigadier General and was appointed on 9 vendémiaire an II (30September 1793) as chief of staff to the Army of the North.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 the LSO {{undertook}} {{its first}} world tour, taking in Israel, Turkey, Iran, India, Hong Kong, Korea, Japan and the United States. The following year István Kertész was appointed principal conductor. Negotiations with the Corporation of the City of London {{with a view}} to establishing the LSO as the resident orchestra of the planned Barbican Centre began in the same year. In 1966 Leonard Bernstein conducted the LSO for the first time, in Mahler's Symphony <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Thousand</b> at the Royal Albert Hall. This was another coup for Fleischmann, who had to overcome Bernstein's scorn for the inadequate rehearsal facilities endured by London orchestras. Bernstein remained associated with the LSO {{for the rest of his}} life, and was its president from 1987 to 1990.|$|E
