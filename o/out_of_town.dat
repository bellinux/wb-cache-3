The highway passes through residential neighborhoods immediately north of downtown, and turns due north near Jackson Catholic Middle School and the historic Michigan State Prison.

5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) started {{construction}} of a freeway bypass of Cadillac in 1999. With {{the completion of the}} southern half of the bypass in 2000, M-55 was rerouted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> along the new freeway. Once the northern half of the bypass was completed on October 30, 2001, US131 was rerouted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> along the new highway {{to the end of the}} freeway where it joined the old alignment north of town. Mitchell Street through downtown Cadillac was redesignated as Bus. US131.|$|E

The highway {{continues}} through rural woodlands past Chip Lake. The road crosses the Manistique River as it runs through Germfask. From just south of Germfask to just south of Seney, the road forms the eastern boundary of the Seney National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E
5|$|H-58 meets M-77 in Grand Marais. This town is the {{location}} of a small harbor that was once the home of a lumber shipping port. H-58 turns south to run concurrently along M-77 for about two blocks before turning back eastward. The county road runs along the southern edge of the harbor past the township's school and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> The pavement ends when the road leaves Alger County for Luce County.|$|E
5|$|M-75 {{begins in}} {{downtown}} Boyne Falls at an intersection with US 131. It follows Mill Street northwesterly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> passing {{to the north}} of a lake and the Boyne Mountain Airport. The airport property ends at the intersection with C-48 west of Boyne Falls. M-75 runs parallel to the Boyne River until it turns west near the Boyne City Municipal Airport to enter the community of Boyne City on East Division Street. Two blocks further west, it meets C-73/East Jordan Road next to the Maple Lawn Cemetery. Next to the cemetery, the highway follows Boyne Avenue northwesterly into downtown. The trunkline turns north on East Street to cross the Boyne River and then turns east on State Street passing Rotary Park on the way <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) measures the average annual daily traffic (AADT) in traffic surveys. AADT {{is a measure of the}} average traffic levels for a section of roadway on any given day of the year. The southern segment of M-75 carried 6,500vehicles daily in the 2007 survey. Of these vehicles, commercial traffic was measured at 280trucks.|$|E

5|$|M-86 {{begins in}} Three Rivers at a {{junction}} with Bus. US131 and M-60. From there the road travels south <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> on Main Street {{and across the}} St. Joseph River. After crossing the river, the highway runs through a residential area of town and turns eastward into rural farm lands. M-86 crosses the Prairie River and follows Burr Oak Street into the community of Centreville. The highway switches to follow Main Street through downtown Centreville; east of downtown, Main Street curves along {{a bend in the}} river, and it runs parallel to the river <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> As part of its support of the state highway system, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the traffic levels along the roads it maintains. These traffic counts are expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a calculation of the vehicles using a segment of roadway on a typical day of the year. In 2009, MDOT measured 7,642vehicles including 138trucks along M-86 in Centreville, the highest traffic levels along the whole highway. As the highway leaves town, it passes by the north side of Lake Templene, and Sand Lake near Nottawa before meeting M-66.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{captured}} {{the state capital}} of Columbia, South Carolina, on February 17, 1865. Fires began that night and by next morning most of the central city was destroyed. The burning of Columbia has engendered controversy ever since, with some claiming the fires were accidental, others a deliberate act of vengeance, and still others that the retreating Confederates burned bales of cotton on their way <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E
5|$|The service {{modifications}} lowered operating expenses, but {{the coefficient}} of use went down dramatically: 0.33 for the first ten months of 1908. The decision to axe the line was made on 1 November 1908. Two strategic errors had been made: wanting a service independent of the CTR's network, and putting its terminus <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> The railway was officially disbanded by a decree of 14 September 1911, the rails were lifted, the public highway restored; {{no trace of the}} tramway remains.|$|E

5|$|With 1,300 deputies {{still in}} Cripple Creek, Sheriff Bowers {{was unable to}} control the army he had created. On June 5, the deputies moved into Altman, perhaps {{as a prelude to}} {{storming}} Bull Hill. The deputies cut the telegraph and telephone wires leading <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> and imprisoned a number of reporters. Concerned that the paramilitary force might get out of hand, Waite again dispatched the state militia, this time under the command of General E.J. Brooks.|$|E
5|$|After Lincoln's {{assassination}} in April 1865, {{black ink}} was thrown on Fillmore's house {{as it was}} not draped in mourning like others, though he was apparently <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> {{at the time and}} put black drapes in the windows once he returned. Although he retained his position as Buffalo's leading citizen and was among those selected to escort the body when Lincoln's funeral train passed through Buffalo, there was still anger against him for his wartime positions. Fillmore supported President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction policies, feeling that the nation needed to be reconciled as quickly as possible. Most of his time was devoted to his civic activities. He aided Buffalo in becoming the third American city, after Boston and Philadelphia, to have a permanent art gallery with the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy.|$|E

5|$|At its {{greatest}} extent in the 1950s, the highway extended north from Webberville through Owosso and St. Charles to a junction with M-46 between Hemlock and Shields. M-47 turned east along M-46, running concurrently with that highway to Saginaw Township. There M-47 turned north independently to a junction with US10, {{and then ran}} concurrently with US10 into Saginaw. Once in the city, M-47 turned north along Bay Street <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> toward Bay City. M-47 joined US23 and followed it north of town. M-47 then ran separately to the state park before turning south and back into downtown Bay City, ending at the US23 business loop.|$|E

In addition to flattering them, this {{allowed him to}} monitor their activities and dealings with the colonial authorities. His clerk appointees in Jaunde informed him of the doings of both the Germans and his subjects. Atangana gained {{a substantial amount of}} wealth. He owned workshops and sold produce from five plantations to provision impressed railway construction workers.|$|E
