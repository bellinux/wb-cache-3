5|$|In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> {{understand}} the quantum aspects of gravity in our four-dimensional universe, some physicists have considered a lower-dimensional mathematical {{model in which}} spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this setting, the mathematics describing the gravitational field simplifies drastically, and one can study quantum gravity using familiar methods from quantum field theory, {{eliminating the need for}} string theory or other more radical approaches to quantum gravity in four dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{relations}} between Edward and Llywelyn rapidly collapsed, leading to Edward invading North Wales in 1276 {{in an attempt}} to break Llywelyn's hold on power. During the war Edward built several major castles in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> control the region and act as bases for campaigning. Edward was successful, and the Treaty of Aberconwy in 1277 reaffirmed English dominance, dividing up most of Llwelyn's lands amongst his brothers and Edward.|$|E

5|$|During the war the Australian Government greatly {{expanded}} its powers in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> direct the war effort, and Australia's industrial {{and human resources}} were focused on supporting the Allied armed forces. The expansion of the government's powers began on 9 September 1939 when the National Security Act became law. This act enabled the government to introduce industrial conscription, and {{both men and women}} were ordered into essential industries. Rationing was first introduced in 1940 and was {{greatly expanded}} during 1942. The Government also strongly encouraged austerity and war bonds as a means of reducing demand for scarce resources.|$|E
5|$|Later in August, Alabama {{departed}} for the Pacific theater; {{the ship was}} assigned to the US Third Fleet during the amphibious operations in the Gilbert islands, particularly Kwajalein in early 1944. During the night of 21 February 1944, Alabamas 5-inch guns were firing upon Japanese aircraft in the area. The ship turned {{in the direction of the}} Japanese aircraft in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> engage them, but the rearmost turret was masked behind the amidships mount. The gunner in the rearmost turret accidentally overrode the safety mechanism that prevented the gun from firing in that circumstance, and when the gun was fired, it hit the 5-inch turret in front of it. Five men were killed and 11 wounded in the incident; an investigation revealed that the override switch was faulty and prone to accidental operation.|$|E

Becoming the first Danish player to compete in the WHL, Hansen scored at a point-per-game pace, leading all rookies with 64 points. He continued his scoring pace in the playoffs with 13 points in 12 games as Portland was eliminated in the second round.|$|E
5|$|Triceratops species {{possessed a}} sturdy build, with strong limbs, short hands with three hooves each, and short feet with four hooves each. Although {{certainly}} quadrupedal, the posture of these dinosaurs {{has long been}} the subject of some debate. Originally, it was believed that the front legs of the animal had to be sprawling at angles from the thorax in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> bear the weight of the head. This stance can be seen in paintings by Charles Knight and Rudolph Zallinger. Ichnological evidence in the form of trackways from horned dinosaurs and recent reconstructions of skeletons (both physical and digital) seem to show that Triceratops and other ceratopsids maintained an upright stance during normal locomotion, with the elbows flexed and slightly bowed out, in an intermediate state between fully upright and fully sprawling (as in the modern rhinoceros).|$|E
5|$|According The New York Times, the {{eavesdropping}} operations did {{not only}} target local criminals, {{but also the}} communications of top Chinese leaders, {{including those of the}} General Secretary, President Hu Jintao.

In August 2011, a phone call between Hu Jintao and anti-corruption official Ma Wen was found to be wiretapped under Bo's orders. The revelations about the eavesdropping operation resulted in intense scrutiny from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. It was also said to have sowed distrust and {{played a role in the}} falling out of Bo and his police chief Wang Lijun, who allegedly began to use the same eavesdropping methods against Bo himself. The operations were believed to have contributed to Bo's downfall in 2012.|$|E

5|$|After {{his time}} at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach {{obtained}} a position as {{an associate professor at}} Harvard Medical School's Department of Pharmacology in 1973. By 1978 he obtained tenure and became a full professor, and continued teaching at Harvard University for the next three years. After a nine-year stint at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, he returned to Harvard to serve as the Nathan Marsh Pusey Professor of Neurobiology and Chairman of the Neurobiology Departments of both Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital from 1990 to 1998. During his years as an associate professor, he researched the development of precursor muscle cells, specifically the development of acetylcholine receptors on embryonic chick pectoral muscles. Later on he continued his research on ARIA that he started at the National Institutes of Health, specifically focusing on the expression of the protein's isoforms and their effects on tyrosine kinases. In 1993, Fischbach was involved with the founding of the Mind, Brain, Behavior Institute. This inter-disciplinary program aims to research the different structures, evolution, and development of the nervous system in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> understand human behavior.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the New Kingdom, Egypt {{had entered}} a long period of {{political}} and economic decline. The priests at Thebes grew more powerful, and they effectively administered Upper Egypt, while kings ruling from Tanis controlled Lower Egypt. Some attempt at using the open tombs was made {{at the start of the}} Twenty-first Dynasty, with the High Priest of Amun, Pinedjem I, adding his cartouche to KV4. The Valley began to be heavily plundered, so during the Twenty-first Dynasty the priests of Amun opened most of the tombs and moved the mummies into three tombs in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> protect them. They removed most of the treasure in order to further protect the bodies from robbers. Most of these were later moved to a single cache near Deir el-Bari (known as TT320). Located in the cliffs overlooking Hatshepsut's famous temple, this mass reburial contained a large number of royal mummies. They were found in a great state of disorder, many placed in other's coffins, and several are still unidentified. Other mummies were moved to the tomb of Amenhotep II, where over a dozen mummies, many of them royal, were later relocated.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt was {{appointed}} Chief of the General Staff (CGS) in August 2006, succeeding General Sir Mike Jackson. Dannatt faced controversy over his outspokenness, in particular his calls for improved pay and conditions for soldiers {{and for a}} drawdown of operations in Iraq in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> man those in Afghanistan. He also set about trying to increase his public profile, worried {{that he was not}} recognisable enough {{at a time when he}} had to defend the Army's reputation against alleged prisoner abuse in Iraq. He later assisted with the formation of Help for Heroes to fund a swimming pool at Headley Court and, later in his tenure, brokered an agreement with the British press that allowed Prince Harry to serve in Afghanistan. He was succeeded as CGS by Sir David Richards and retired in 2009, taking up the largely honorary post of Constable of the Tower of London, which he held until July 2016.|$|E

5|$|Neuner's {{shooting}} performances {{have been}} a regular topic in the German media. At times she {{has been reluctant to}} discuss her shooting in interviews and has said the public's fixation on it contributes to the problem. She has insisted her difficulties in the standing position are not due to technical weaknesses but psychological, and her training results are just as good as the results of her team mates. She explained in interviews that she had developed a fear of the standing shooting over time, knowing she had to justify herself after the race if she missed. In 2008, Neuner trained with Bundeswehr shooting coach and former large calibre world champion, Rudi Krenn, and subsequently changed her stance slightly. Since 2009, she has worked with a psychologist, primarily focusing on mental techniques to build her confidence on the shooting range. Her standing position average has improved from 60% to 75% from 2008 to 2011. Neuner has been wearing ear plugs during some of the races in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> concentrate while shooting. The individual race, which places a high emphasis on shooting, has traditionally been her worst discipline (each shooting error results in a one-minute time penalty, instead of a penalty loop).|$|E
5|$|On 24 August, the Half Flight was {{augmented}} by four Martinsyde S1s and redesignated No.30 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps (RFC). The squadron moved into Kut following the city's capture by the Allies during the Battle of Es Sinn in September; {{for his part}} in the operation, Petre was again mentioned in despatches. Over the following two months, however, both Treloar and White were captured and became prisoners of war, leaving Petre as the only pilot remaining from the original Half Flight. Around the time of the Battle of Ctesiphon in November, he devised an implement shaped like a small garden rake that allowed him to accurately measure ground distances from the air in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> map the desert terrain. During the Siege of Kut between December 1915 and April 1916, he flew a series of missions using crude parachutes to airdrop grain supplies (and a millstone for grinding), medical supplies and equipment to the town's entrapped garrison, which included nine of his AFC mechanics.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 1957, the British {{territory}} of Malaya received {{its independence from}} the Crown {{as a part of}} Britain's colonial withdrawal from the Far East, after nearly a decade of tortuous counter-insurgency warfare by British and Commonwealth troops against Malayan rebels in the Malayan Emergency. British plans dictated that the new state would be federated with the British colonies of Sarawak, Sabah, and Brunei in northern Borneo in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> protect British military and economic interests in those regions. Brunei did not join, but Sarawak, Sabah, and Singapore had all agreed to join the new Federation by 1963. This project, labeled the 'Grand Design' by politician Malcolm MacDonald in the 1950s, became the cornerstone of British strategic thinking concerning Southeast Asia, and led to the initial federation of the numerous Malayan states in spite of their multifarious differences, with Singapore and the Borneo states to join later. This plan also earned the support of the Malaysian government, which hoped to forestall claims from Indonesia on Borneo.|$|E
