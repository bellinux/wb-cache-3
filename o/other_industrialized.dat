5|$|The 1973–1974 {{oil embargo}} had lasting {{effects on the}} United States and <b>other</b> <b>industrialized</b> nations, which {{established}} the International Energy Agency in response, as well as national emergency stockpiles designed to withstand months of future supply disruptions. Oil conservation efforts included lower speed limits on highways, smaller and more energy-efficient cars and appliances, year-round daylight saving time, reduced usage of heating and air-conditioning, better insulation, increased support of mass transit, and greater emphasis on coal, natural gas, ethanol, nuclear and other alternative energy sources. These long-term efforts became effective enough that US oil consumption would rise only 11 percent during 1980–2014, while real GDP rose 150 percent. But in the 1970s, OPEC nations demonstrated convincingly that their oil {{could be used as}} both a political and economic weapon against other nations, {{at least in the short}} term.|$|E
5|$|In October 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, {{consisting}} of the Arab majority of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) declared significant production cuts and an oil embargo against the United States and <b>other</b> <b>industrialized</b> nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. A previous embargo attempt was largely ineffective {{in response to the}} Six-Day War in 1967. However, in 1973, the result was a sharp rise in oil prices and OPEC revenues, from US$3/bbl to US$12/bbl, and an emergency period of energy rationing, intensified by panic reactions, a declining trend in US oil production, currency devaluations, and a lengthy UK coal-miners dispute. For a time, the UK imposed an emergency three-day workweek. Seven European nations banned non-essential Sunday driving. US gas stations limited the amount of gasoline that could be dispensed, closed on Sundays, and restricted the days when gasoline could be purchased, based on license plate numbers. Even after the embargo ended in March 1974 following intense diplomatic activity, prices continued to rise. The world experienced a global economic recession, with unemployment and inflation surging simultaneously, steep declines in stock and bond prices, major shifts in trade balances and petrodollar flows, and a dramatic end to the post-WWII economic boom.|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} the century, a {{comprehensive}} set of regulations was in place in England that affected all industries. A similar system (with certain national differences) was implemented in <b>other</b> <b>industrializing</b> countries {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century and the early 20th century.|$|R
50|$|By the 1980s, {{television}} dramas {{had become}} a cultural icon of Hong Kong throughout East and Southeast Asia, with the territory becoming a center for television and film production. Furthermore, {{the success of the}} Hong Kong television industry later served as a major influence for television in mainland China and <b>other</b> <b>industrializing</b> Asian nations, most notably Taiwan and South Korea.|$|R
25|$|The {{controversy}} came {{shortly after}} the World Trade Organisation's Doha Round of global trade talks. At which many member states called for the U.S. to open up its ports to international competition, {{in the same way}} that <b>other</b> <b>industrialized</b> nations have pushed poorer countries into opening up their service sectors (e.g. water, telecoms, etc.).|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{and most}} <b>other</b> <b>industrialized</b> nations, {{emergency}} medical providers {{are required to}} treat any patient that has a life-threatening condition, irrespective of the patient's financial resources. In the U.S., the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act requires that hospitals treat all patients in need of emergency medical care without considering patients' ability to pay for service.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{accounted}} for about one-third of economic production in the 1920s, but by the 1950s this fraction dramatically reduced to one-tenth. This sudden increase of oil production restricted Venezuela's overall ability to create and maintain other industries. The government had ignored serious social problems, including education, health, infrastructure, agriculture, and domestic industries, causing Venezuela to fall well behind <b>other</b> <b>industrialized</b> countries.|$|E
50|$|The {{price of}} raw {{and other natural}} {{commodities}} such as oil, gold, and uranium have risen substantially in recent years, due to increased demand from China, India, and <b>other</b> <b>industrializing</b> countries. However, Simon has argued that this price increase is not necessarily contrary to his cornucopian theory. Ehrlich has dismissed the bet as a side issue and stated that the main worry is environmental problems like the ozone hole, acid rain, and global warming.|$|R
25|$|China's {{success is}} also {{due to the}} export-led growth {{strategy}} used successfully by the Four Asian Tigers beginning with Japan in the 1960s–1970s and <b>other</b> Newly <b>industrialized</b> counties.|$|R
40|$|The Industrialization of {{countries}} is {{in every way}} influenced by forerunner nations. This is exemplified in Western Europe’s copying of Britain’s technology and manufacturing systems. This work presents {{a study of the}} industrialization of nations such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and several <b>other</b> <b>industrializing</b> countries and the lessons learned revealed that the industrialization of these nations was based on initial imitative-reverse-engineering of products of forerunner nations which then leads to endogenous growth and the onset of innovation under certain constraints. This is a strategic form of import substitution and is in fact the model around which a plan for Nigeria’s Industrialization has been buil...|$|R
25|$|Belgium's {{unemployment}} rate was 6.5% in 2008. A total of 4.99 million people make up Belgium's labor force. The {{majority of these}} people (73%) work in the service sector. Belgian industry claims 25% {{of the labor force}} and agriculture only 2%. As in <b>other</b> <b>industrialized</b> nations, pension and other social entitlement programs have become a major concern as the baby boom generation approaches retirement.|$|E
25|$|Children {{from poor}} {{immigrant}} or working-class families {{are less likely}} to succeed in school than children from middle- or upper-class backgrounds. This disadvantage for the financially challenged of Germany is greater than in any <b>other</b> <b>industrialized</b> nation. However, the true reasons stretch beyond economic ones. The poor also tend to be less educated. After allowing for parental education, money does not {{play a major role in}} children's academic outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{commercial}} banks and retail banks, investment banks {{do not take}} deposits. From the passage of Glass–Steagall Act in 1933 until its repeal in 1999 by the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, the United States maintained a separation between investment banking and {{commercial banks}}. <b>Other</b> <b>industrialized</b> countries, including G7 countries, have historically not maintained such a separation. As part of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd–Frank Act of 2010), the Volcker Rule asserts some institutional separations of investment banking services from commercial banking.|$|E
40|$|By {{comparison}} with <b>other</b> advanced <b>industrialized</b> economies (see table 5. 1), Japan imports a remarkably small {{share of the}} manufactured goods it consumes. Unlike the experience of <b>other</b> advanced <b>industrialized</b> economies, this small share has been virtually constant for decades. This distinctive trade structure is regularly cited by policymakers as evidence that foreign manu-facturers are systematically denied access to the Japanese market (McDonald 1982). Foreign manufacturers who have tried unsuccessfully to sell in the Japanese market always concede that formal barriers to imports of manufac-tured goods are low by any reasonable standard. They argue, however, that the regulatory environment within which most Japanese firms operate allows wide scope for arrangements keeping out those foreign manufactures that ar...|$|R
50|$|Bishop Whelan {{became a}} civic leader in Wheeling, the new diocese's largest city (pop. 13,161). It had grown {{because of its}} {{location}} on the National Road and access to both water and coal power. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad formally reached Wheeling in 1853, but many Irish emigrants building that and other railroads or working in the new factories had already passed through or settled in the city. <b>Other</b> <b>industrializing</b> areas of the new diocese (which initially had only two or four Catholic churches and two or six Catholic priests) included Charlestown {{and to a lesser}} extent Huntington and Martinsburg/Berkeley Springs/Harper's Ferry. The mountainous new diocese consisted of several distinct valleys, with many immigrants but limited funds and access to social services.|$|R
5000|$|As in <b>other</b> <b>industrializing</b> countries, {{the role}} of women in Mauritius is {{changing}} rapidly. A major force for change has been the rapid influx of women into the many jobs created in the 1980s in the export processing zones. Although low-paying for the most part, the jobs allow women formerly confined to the roles of mother and wife to gain a certain degree of personal and social freedom. One woman, in a 1993 National Geographic article, said: [...] "For a Mauritian woman, to work is to be free. Before, a girl could not leave home until her parents found a husband for her, and then she moved into her husband's family's home and spent the rest of her life having babies. I met my husband at work, and it was my decision to marry him. Now we live in our own house." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{change was}} publicized {{as a way}} to {{increase}} the ability for missionaries to serve. At the time, missionaries paid for all their expenses in their country of service. Recession during the Carter presidency pushed inflation higher and the exchange rate lower. This sudden increase in costs together with already high costs of living in Europe and <b>other</b> <b>industrialized</b> nations resulted in a steady {{decline in the number of}} missionaries able to pay for two full years of service. The shortening of the required service time from 24 to 18 months cut off this decline in numbers, leveling out in the period following the reinstatement. For those in foreign missions, this was barely enough time to learn a more difficult language and difficulty with language was reported.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, the American {{standard}} of living was the highest among the industrial countries, according to the OECD. Out of the 85 million households in the United States, 64% owned their own living quarters, 55% had at least two TV sets, and 51% {{had more than one}} vehicle. In terms of possession of telephones, TV sets, school enrollments, animal protein in diets, and energy consumption, the United States was far ahead of <b>other</b> <b>industrialized</b> countries. Wealthy and middle class and a majority of poor Americans had higher after-tax incomes than their counterparts almost anywhere else in the world. By 1985, the US per capita income was $11,727, one of the highest among industrialized countries. By the mid-1980s, 98% of all households had a telephone service, 77% a washing machine, 45% a freezer, and 43% a dishwasher.|$|E
25|$|Science and {{technology}} in Israel {{is one of the}} country's most highly developed and industrialized sectors. The percentage of Israelis engaged in scientific and technological inquiry, and the amount spent on research and development (R) in relation to gross domestic product (GDP), is {{among the highest in the}} world. Israel ranks fourth in the world in scientific activity, as measured by the number of scientific publications per million citizens. Israel's percentage of the total number of scientific articles published worldwide is almost 10 times higher than its percentage of the world's population. Despite its small population relative to <b>other</b> <b>industrialized</b> nations around the world, Israel has the highest number of scientists and technicians per capita in the world with 140 scientists and technicians per 10,000 employees.

40|$|It is {{believed}} that telework has numerous benefits for individuals, organizations, and the whole society. Despite the expected benefits, adoption and diffusion of telework have been considerably slow. In Japan, the adoption rate of telework {{is said to be}} lower compared with <b>other</b> <b>industrialize</b> countries. The aim of this research is to examine the telework implementation status and the perceptions of workers and management toward telework and thereby identify the problems causing for the slow adoption of telework in Japan. This paper presents a survey study based on 1, 134 workers and 463 organizations in Japan. The adoption patterns of three telework types (satellite office, telecommuting, and mobile work) in different areas and by the size of organizations are discussed, and perceptions of workers and management are presented. Reasons for different patterns of adoption and future proliferation of telework in Japan are also discussed. 1...|$|R

25|$|Over the years, {{government}} {{budget cuts}} {{have taken their}} toll. Israel was amongst the top-ranked nations in international rankings for science and mathematics performance in the 1960s, but dropped to 33 out of 41 nations in the 2002 survey. Wages for Israeli teachers are low compared to <b>other</b> <b>industrialized</b> countries, especially due to {{the small amount of}} frontal teaching hours with respect to other developed countries (the salary per hour {{is similar to that of}} the OECD standards), according to a survey of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The government-appointed Dovrat Commission, led by Shlomo Dovrat, concluded in 2004, that the key to improving Israeli education is not more money but better-quality teaching. The recommendations included a reform giving school principals the right to fire teachers of poor quality, and reward better ones with higher pay. These moves have been blocked by Israel's teachers' unions, which have paralyzed schools with a series of long strikes, mostly blocking the proposed reforms.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{epidemics}} of polio began {{to hit the}} United States and <b>other</b> <b>industrialized</b> countries. As hospitals filled with patients in iron lungs, {{and tens of thousands}} were left disabled, the fear of polio grew, leading to the closing of many public facilities. Meanwhile, Dr. Jonas Salk had set up the University of Pittsburgh's Virus Research Lab in the basement of what is now Salk Hall. By 1951, Salk and his team had begun immunization experiments in monkeys using dead polio virus. Soon, however, Salk began to test inoculations in paralyzed polio patients and by 1953 human trials among the general population were initiated. By the spring of the following year, the largest controlled field trials in medical history were underway, and by 1955 the vaccine developed by Salk and his researchers was declared effective. By 1962, Salk's vaccine had reduced the incidence of polio in the United States by 95 percent. The breakthroughs in immunology and vaccine development at Pitt by Salk and his team are {{considered one of the most}} significant scientific and medical achievements in history.|$|E
25|$|The Gender Equality Bureau {{defines a}} work-life balance {{as a society}} in which an {{individual}} is not limited by his/her gender in choosing a fulfilling occupation that will accommodate each stage of an individual's life. Japanese workers on average have a minimum of ten work days for vacation time per year and are given zero paid public holidays, numbers that are far below any <b>other</b> <b>industrialized</b> nation except the United States. In order to ensure that Japanese workers are free to lead a healthy and affluent life in a style of their choosing while also maintaining their economic independence, the Gender Equality Bureau in 2007 recommended a variety of policies for both the public and private sector in order to increase time-off for employees. The Bureau has pushed private employers to offer flexible hours that can cater to a variety of lifestyles, such as offering child-care leave for men in order to promote the male's role in child-rearing. Government, per the Bureau's recommendation, is tasked with providing a policy structure that meets both male and female needs, hiring only companies that practice work-life balance for public contracts, and passing legislation that signifies the importance of both genders taking an active role in domestic work.|$|E

500|$|In January 2014, Iger {{announced}} that Frozen would be adapted into a Broadway stage musical. In {{the space of}} a single business quarter, Iger went from speaking of Frozens [...] "franchise potential" [...] (in February 2014) to saying that it was [...] "probably" [...] one of Disney's [...] "top five franchises" [...] (in May 2014). The film's massive popularity resulted in an unusually severe merchandise shortage in the United States and several <b>other</b> <b>industrialized</b> countries in April 2014, which caused resale prices for higher-quality limited-edition Frozen dolls and costumes to skyrocket past $1,000 on eBay. By the time the merchandise shortage was finally resolved in early November 2014 (nearly a year after the film's release), Disney had sold over three million Frozen costumes in North America alone. Wait times for the meet-and-greets at Disney Parks soon regularly exceeded four hours and forced management in February 2014 to indefinitely extend what was originally intended as a temporary film promotion. Disney Parks later put on a temporary event (Frozen Summer Fun) at Disney's Hollywood Studios, then announced on September 12, 2014, that the Maelstrom ride at Epcot's Norway pavilion would be closed and replaced with a Frozen-based attraction, which opened in early 2016.

40|$|When {{social and}} {{economic}} conditions change dramatically, status hierarchies in place {{for hundreds of years}} can crumble as marketization destabilizes once rigid boundaries. This study examines such changes in symbolic power through an ethnographic study of a village in North India. Marketization and accompanying privatization do not create an independent sphere where only money matters, but due to a mix of new socioeconomic motives, they produce new social obligations, contests, and solidarities. These findings call into question the emphasis in consumer research on top-down class emulation as an essential characteristic of status hierarchies. This study offers insights into sharing as a means of enacting and reshaping symbolic power within a status hierarchy. A new order based on markets and consumption is disrupting the old order based on caste. As the old moral order dissolves, so do the old status hierarchies, obligations, dispositions, and norms of sharing that held the village together for centuries. In the microcosm of these gains and losses, we may see something of the broader {{social and economic}} changes taking place throughout India and <b>other</b> <b>industrializing</b> countries...|$|R
