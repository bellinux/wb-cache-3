30|$|The lipid {{produced}} by microorganisms {{is considered to}} have powerful potential {{for the development of}} a new kind of energy, and has received significant interest from sustainable energy researchers. Lipid accumulated by oleaginous yeast is viewed as a promising alternative to second-generation biodiesel, since the composition of the fatty acids {{produced by}} yeast is suitable for biodiesel production. That is, it contains palmitic (16 : 0), stearic (18 : 0), oleic (18 : 1), and linoleic (18 : 2) acids at a high ratio, mainly in the form of triacylglycerol (TAG) (Beopoulos et al. 2011; Knothe 2009; Meng et al. 2009; Sitepu et al. 2014). Compared to <b>other</b> <b>oleaginous</b> microorganisms, oleaginous yeasts are advantageous due to their rapid growth rate (Li et al. 2008), and they are deemed to have the potential to convert various carbon sources, such as cellobiose, xylose and starch, to lipid (Gong et al. 2012; Hu et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2014; Tanimura et al. 2014 a).|$|R
30|$|While lipid {{content and}} yield can vary greatly among species, overall fatty acid {{profiles}} {{have been shown}} to be quite consistent under all conditions. As shown in Table  4, the major fatty acids of two tested strains were oleic acid (ca. 60 % in TJUWZ 4 and ca. 42 % in TJUWZA 11), palmitic acid (24.3 % in TJUWZ 4 and 30.4 % in TJUWZA 11), and linoleic acid (ca. 11 % in TJUWZ 4 and 23 % in TJUWZA 11). Minor fatty acids were stearic acid (18 : 0), myristic acid (14 : 0) and palmitoleic acid (16 : 1). These are consistent with the range of lipids generally found in <b>other</b> <b>oleaginous</b> yeast species (Dias et al. 2015; Sitepu et al. 2013).|$|R

In 2013-14, two-way merchandise trade totaled AUD$3.4 million, of which AUD$1.3 million were Australian exports, made up mainly {{of paper and}} paper products, civil engineering equipment and machine tools for working metal. Australia's major import from Paraguay (2013-14) was oil-seeds and <b>oleaginous</b> <b>fruits.</b> In December 2009, P&O Maritime Services acquired a 70 per cent stake in the Dos Santos Group Bulk Barging business, a river navigation business based in Asunción. P&O's head office is based in Melbourne and the company maintains operations in five Australian ports. There may be some openings for investment in the agribusiness sector and for the export of agriculture related and other products and services from Australia. The mining industry in Paraguay has, to date, been relatively underdeveloped but the recent discovery {{of one of the}} world's three largest deposits of ilmenite (a titanium ore) has the potential to greatly expand mining in the country. Australian companies with existing interests in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay may find that the close commercial ties that these countries have with Paraguay may facilitate entry into the Paraguayan market.

The fatty acid composition of Anacardium occidentale L has previously been reported by [5, 6].|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{route of}} biodiesel production {{is based on}} the transesterification reaction, in which the main requirement is the use of  low acidity raw material.   It is known that the cost of raw material, such as soybean oil, has the largest contribution to the final price of biodiesel. Brazil has a huge potential for the use of <b>others</b> <b>oleaginous</b> plants, such as Macauba. However, the extractive way of harvest generates a raw material of high acidity. The objective {{of this study is to}} use commercial cationic exchange resins as heterogeneous and reusable catalysts to esterify the free fatty acids content, reducing the acidity and making the Macauba oil suitable to transesterification process.

In addition, P. segobiensis SSOH 12 comprises 16 % palmitoleic acid (C 16 : 1), an omega- 7 mono-unsaturated fatty acid which has been shown to have positive effects against obesity (Yang et al. [2011]) and potential for the prevention of brain and cardiovascular diseases (Matsunaga et al. [1995]). It is a component of some oil seeds, especially sea-buckthorn (Fatima et al. [2012]) or macadamia (Nestel et al. [1994]). An alternative source via microbial production is the opportunity to produce palmitoleic acid in sufficient quantities for possible future applications in medicine. P. segobiensis SSOH 12 has been described {{as one of the best}} xylose-converting strains (Liu et al. [2010]; Toivola et al. [1984]). Hence, the investigation of lipid production with xylose as the carbon source may be a worthwhile exercise.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Yarrowia lipolytica is an {{oleaginous}} yeast {{which has}} emerged as an important microorganism for several biotechnological processes, such as the production of organic acids, lipases and proteases. It is also considered {{a good candidate for}} single-cell oil production. Although some of its metabolic pathways are well studied, its metabolic engineering is hindered by the lack of a genome-scale model that integrates the current knowledge about its metabolism. Results Combining in silico tools and expert manual curation, we have produced an accurate genome-scale metabolic model for Y. lipolytica. Using a scaffold derived from a functional metabolic model of the well-studied but phylogenetically distant yeast S. cerevisiae, we mapped conserved reactions, rewrote gene associations, added species-specific reactions and inserted specialized copies of scaffold reactions to account for species-specific expansion of protein families. We used physiological measures obtained under lab conditions to validate our predictions. Conclusions Y. lipolytica iNL 895 represents the first well-annotated metabolic model of an oleaginous yeast, providing a base for future metabolic improvement, and a starting point for the metabolic reconstruction of other species in the Yarrowia clade and <b>other</b> <b>oleaginous</b> yeasts. </p...|$|R

Emotional eating (EE) has been {{positively associated with}} such conditions, however, {{little is known about}} the relationship between EE and energy-dense food intake that may influence risk for developing these conditions. Objective: To examine associations between EE and energy-dense food intake in Latino men and women. Methods: Latino individuals were recruited from a community health center in Lawrence, MA. Participants completed standardized assessments. EE was measured with the Three Factor Eating Behavior Questionnaire R 18 -V 2. Dietary intake was measured with a culturally tailored Food Frequency Questionnaire. Energy-dense food groups defined as food groups exceeding 225 calories per 100 grams were identified. Covariates considered in this analysis included: age, sex, education, employment status and BMI. Statistical analysis consisted of multivariable logistic regression. Results: A total of 201 participants were included in this analysis (53. 7 % female, 68. 1 % Dominicans). After adjusting for covariates, EE was significantly associated with high intake of sweet and/or fatty foods, namely dairy desserts (i. e., ice-cream, sherbet and frozen yogurt) (OR= 1. 55; 95 %CI= 1. 08, 2. 21; p= 0. 017), <b>oleaginous</b> <b>fruits</b> (i. e., nuts and seeds) (OR= 1. 44; 95 %CI= 1. 01, 2. 05; p= 0. 046) and baked goods (i. e., cakes, cookies, pies, doughnuts and muffins) (OR= 1. 54; 95 %CI= 1. 07, 2. 20; p= 0. 020). Conclusion: EE was positively associated with consumption of energy-dense foods in this Latino sample. Future studies should examine longitudinal associations between EE, intake of energy-dense foods and risk of chronic health conditions. Understanding these associations can unveil potential intervention targets for Latinos at high risk of diet-related chronic health conditions...|$|R

AFs were extracted from oil sample by means of matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPDE), utilizing C 18 as dispersing material. No further purification step, such as lipid removal, was performed. Aflatoxin M 1, the hepatic metabolite of AFB 1, was employed as internal standard. Olive oil extract was analyzed by LC/ESI-MS/MS in positive ionization mode, with multireaction monitoring acquisition. Due to a signal suppression ranging between 4 and 23 %, quantitation was performed by matrix-matched calibration curves. The regression line coefficients of determination were above 0. 9991. Sample recoveries ranged from 92 to 107 %, with relative standard deviations below 13 % for spiking levels between 0. 5 and 5 ng g(- 1); method quantification limits ranged between 0. 04 and 0. 12 ng g(- 1).

It is thus necessary to develop bioenergy exploitation plans {{in order to}} maximize their potentiality, keeping at the same time under control all the other issues that may be of relevance. The area considered in this work lies within a particular Brazilian Region called Cerrado. The Brazilian Biodiesel Development Plan suggests traditional soybean plantations in the Cerrado should be substituted with <b>other</b> <b>oleaginous</b> crops, such as castor. The effectiveness of such a plan can be analyzed by solving a mathematical programming problem that maximizes the energy output from oleaginous crops. Results strongly depend on the assumed productivity of castor. On the other hand, energy production is less sensitive to such a parameter. Indeed, crop productivity is better described as a stochastic variable, since it depends not only on the climatic conditions, but also on market evolution and on the improvement of the cultivation techniques.

40|$|Background The yeast Metschnikowia pulcherrima, {{previously}} utilised as {{a biological}} control agent, was evaluated for {{its potential to}} produce lipids for biofuel production. Results Cultivation in low cost non-sterile conditions was achieved by exploiting its ability to grow at low temperature and pH and to produce natural antimicrobial compounds. Although not previously classified as oleaginous, a combination of low temperature and restricted nutrient availability triggered high levels of oil production in M. pulcherrima cultures. This regime was designed to trigger the sporulation process but prevent its completion to allow the accumulation of a subset of a normally transitional, but oil-rich, ‘pulcherrima’ cell type. This approach resulted in yields of up to 40 % lipid, which compares favourably with <b>other</b> <b>oleaginous</b> microbes. We also demonstrate that M. pulcherrima metabolises glycerol and a diverse range of other sugars, suggesting that heterogeneous biomass could provide a suitable carbon source. M. pulcherrima also grows well in a minimal media containing no yeast extract. Finally, we demonstrate {{the potential of the}} yeast to produce lipids inexpensively on an industrial scale by culturing the yeast in a 500 L, open air, tank reactor without any significant contamination.

On the basis of KOG analysis, the number of genes (219 genes) categorized into lipid transport and metabolism classification in P. antarctica was {{one and a half}} times larger than that of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (140 genes). The gene encoding an ATP/citrate lyase (ACL) related to acetyl-CoA synthesis conserved in oleaginous strains was found in P. antarctica genome: the single ACL gene possesses the four domains identical to that of the human gene, whereas the <b>other</b> <b>oleaginous</b> ascomycetous species have the two genes covering the four domains. P. antarctica genome exhibited a remarkable degree of synteny to U. maydis genome, however, the comparison of the gene expression profiles under the culture on the two carbon sources, glucose and soybean oil, by the DNA microarray method revealed that transcriptomes between the two species were significantly different. In P. antarctica, expression of the gene sets relating fatty acid metabolism were markedly up-regulated under the oily conditions compared with glucose. Additionally, MEL biosynthesis cluster of P. antarctica was highly expressed regardless of the carbon source as compared to U. maydis.

40|$|The colonial {{microalga}} Botryococcus braunii accumulates {{large quantities}} of hydrocarbons mainly in the extracellular space; most <b>other</b> <b>oleaginous</b> microalgae store lipids in the cytoplasm. Botryococcus braunii is classified into three principal races (A, B, and L) based on the types of hydrocarbons. Race B has attracted the most attention {{as an alternative to}} petroleum by its higher hydrocarbon contents than the other races and its hydrocarbon components, botryococcenes and methylsqualenes, both can be readily converted into biofuels. We studied race B using fluorescence and electron microscopy, and clarify the stage when extracellular hydrocarbon accumulation occurs during the cell cycle, in a correlation with the behavior and structural changes of the lipid bodies and discussed development of the algal colony. New accumulation of lipids on the cell surface occurred after cell division in the basolateral region of daughter cells. While lipid bodies were observed throughout the cell cycle, their size and inclusions were dynamically changing. When cells began dividing, the lipid bodies increased in size and inclusions until the extracellular accumulation of lipids started. Most of the lipids disappeared from the cytoplasm concomitant with the extracellular accumulation, and then reformed. We therefore hypothesize that lipid bodies produced during the growth of B. braunii are related to lipid secretion. New lipids secreted at the cell surface formed layers of oil droplets, to a maximum depth of six layers, and fused to form flattened, continuous sheets. The sheets that combined a pair of daughter cells remained during successive cellular divisions and the colon...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTo be {{labelled}} as “extra-virgin”, olive oil should be cold-pressed {{and may not}} contain refined oil or oil from <b>other</b> <b>oleaginous</b> seeds or nuts (Reg. EC 1531 / 2001). Adulteration of {{extra virgin olive oil}} (EVOO) with hazelnut oil (HAO) is a serious concern both for oil suppliers and consumers. The high degree of similarity between the two fats complicates the detection of low percentage of HAO in EVOO. Many analytical approaches have been developed during last years to trace HAO in EVOO, principally based on chromatographic analyses, differential scanning calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Adulteration of EVOO with HAO may introduce hazelnut-derived allergens. The aim of this work was to analyse the protein and allergen content of EVOO intentionally spiked with raw cold-pressed HAO or solvent-extracted HAO. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the presence of hazelnut proteins in solvent-extracted HAO with molecular masses ranging from 10 - 60 kDa. In contrast, cold-pressed HAO did not show traces of protein. In spiked EVOO, solvent-extracted HAO was still detected at 1 % contamination level. Several bands on SDS-PAGE migrated at apparent molecular masses coinciding with known allergens like Cor a 1 (~ 17 kDa), Cor a 2 (~ 14 kDa), Cor a 8 (~ 12 kDa), oleosin (~ 17 kDa) and Cor a 9 (~ 60 kDa). MALDI-TOF MS analysis confirmed the presence of two oleosin isoforms and of Cor a 9. Immunoblotting demostrated that an allergic patient with known reactivity to Cor a 1 and Cor a 2 indeed recognized a 17 kDa band in solvent-extracted HAO. In conclusion, we have shown that adulteration of extra virgin olive oil with solvent extracted hazelnut oil can be traced by simple SDS-PAGE analysis, and that such practice introduces a potential risk for hazelnut allergic patients...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: (Lipid {{profile and}} {{antimicrobial}} activity of microbial oils from 16 oleaginous yeasts isolated from artisanal cheese). Microbial oil {{is becoming an}} alternative to the increasing cost of vegetable oils, and it can be used for many applications, as biodiesel production and food supplementation. In particular, oleaginous yeasts, being unicellular, devoid of endotoxins, and suitable for large-scale fermentation, are particularly attractive for biotechnological approaches. This work aimed to identify, by molecular analyses, sixteen yeast strains as well as analyze the lipid profile and potential antimicrobial activity of the oil produced by them. All strains were identified as Yarrowia lipolytica, a promising single-cell-oil producer. No antimicrobial activity was found for the oil analyzed, although the lipid profile showed interesting results. The major fatty acids identified were oleic (18 : 1 n 9) and linoleic (18 : 2 n 6 c) and the minor fatty acids were palmitic (C 16 : 0), palmitoleic (C 16 : 1), heptadecanoic (C 17 : 1), estearic (C 18 : 0) and α-linolenic (C 18 : 3 n 3). This last omega- 3 fatty acid was identified on two strains (QU 22 and QU 137), enabling the oil produced by them to be used for dietary applications. Moreover, the oil of the <b>other</b> <b>oleaginous</b> yeasts analyzed in this study appears to be suitable for biodiesel production, since their lipid profiles are similar to the vegetable oils, widely used for that end. Key words: single-cell-oil, fatty acid, Yarrowia lipolytica. RESUMO: (Perfil lipídico e atividade antimicrobiana de óleos microbianos de 16 leveduras oleaginosas isoladas de queijo arte-sanal).

40|$|According to European Union Regulation EC 1531 / 2001, {{olive oil}} {{labelled}} as oextra-virgino should be cold-pressed and contain no refined oil or oil from <b>other</b> <b>oleaginous</b> seeds or nuts. Adulteration of {{extra virgin olive}} oil (EVOO) with hazelnut oil (HAO) is a serious concern both for oil suppliers and consumers. The high degree of similarity between the two fats complicates the detection of low percentages of HAO in EVOO. Many analytical approaches have been developed in recent years to trace HAO in EVOO, principally based on chromatographic analyses, differential scanning calorimetry or nuclear magnetic resonance. In addition adulteration of EVOO with HAO may introduce hazelnut-derived allergens. The aim of this work was to analyse the protein and allergen content of EVOO intentionally spiked with raw cold-pressed HAO or solvent-extracted HAO. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the presence of hazelnut proteins in solvent-extracted HAO with molecular masses ranging 10 - 60 kDa. In contrast, cold-pressed HAO showed no traces of protein.

40|$|A {{surplus of}} {{glycerol}} is obtained from biodiesel manufacturing and represents a waste product whose applications are lacking. Thus, {{the use of}} glycerol as substrate for fermentation processes yielding valuable products is very attractive. In this study, the utilization of glycerol as a growth substrate for the cultivation of oleaginous yeasts was explored with the aim to produce microbial oils. Forty strains of environmental non-conventional yeasts belonging to 19 different species were screened for the ability to grow on glycerol and produce intracellular lipids in a medium containing an excess of this carbon source (C:N = 48 : 1). Three strains, belonging to the species Candida freyschussii, Pichia farinosa, and Saccharomyces spencerorum, depleted 40 g/L glycerol within 120 h and produced intracellular lipids. C. freyschussii yielded the highest amounts, lipids accounting for the 33 % of biomass on dry basis. 1 H-NMR analysis revealed that the lipid extract did not contain detectable free fatty acids and was composed mostly of triacylglycerols. Lipid composition, determined by GC-MS analysis, was similar to plant oils, and may be optimal feedstock for biodiesel production, being dominated by monounsaturated C 16 and C 18. As in <b>other</b> <b>oleaginous</b> yeasts, lipid production by C. freyschussii sp. increased {{with the increase of}} the C:N ratio of the medium, but growth was inhibited at glycerol concentrations higher than 40 g/L. As a result, lipid production was the highest with 40 g/L glycerol, yielding 4. 7 g/L lipids, with a mean volumetric productivity of 0. 15 g/L/h. In order to prevent growth inhibition over 40 g/L glycerol and extend the lipogenic phase, different fed-batch strategies were tried. The best performing processes took advantage from the feeding with concentrated media exhibiting the same C:N ratio of the basal medium, leading to very productive high cell density cultures. With the continuous feeding of 20 X-concentrated medium, 29 g/L lipids (i. e. the 32 % of biomass) were obtained in 100 h of cultivation, with a mean volumetric productivity of 0. 30 g/L/h. The values herein reported are among the highest yield and productivity values ever obtained for fermentative processes exploiting oleaginous fungi to produce lipids from glycerol. Therefore, C. freyschussii could be considered as an interesting microorganism to convert glycerol into microbial oils for biofuel industr...|$|R
40|$|Background : Because {{the model}} yeast Yarrowia lipolytica can {{synthesize}} and store lipids in quantities up to 20 % of its dry weight, it is a promising microorganism for oil production at an industrial scale. Typically, optimization of the lipid production process is {{performed in the}} laboratory and later scaled up for industrial production. However, the scale-up process can be complicated by genetic modifications that are optimized for one set of growing conditions can confer a less-than-optimal phenotype in a different environment. To address this issue, small cultivation systems have been developed that mimic the conditions in benchtop bioreactors. In this work, we used one such microbioreactor system, the BioLector, to develop high-throughput fermentation procedures that optimize growth and lipid accumulation in Y. lipolytica. Using this system, {{we were able to}} monitor lipid and biomass production in real time throughout the culture duration. Results : The BioLector can monitor the growth of Y. lipolytica in real time by evaluating scattered light; this produced accurate measurements until cultures reached an equivalent of OD 600 nm = 115 and a cell dry weight of 100 g L− 1. In addition, a lipid-specific fluorescent probe was applied which reliably monitored lipid production up to a concentration of 12 g L− 1. Through screening various growing conditions, we determined that a carbon/nitrogen ratio of 35 was the most efficient for lipid production. Further screening showed that ammonium chloride and glycerol were the most valuable nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively, for growth and lipid production. Moreover, a carbon concentration above 1 M appeared to impair growth and lipid accumulation. Finally, we used these optimized conditions to screen engineered strains of Y. lipolytica with high lipid-accumulation capability. The growth and lipid content of the strains cultivated in the BioLector were compared to those grown in benchtop bioreactors. Conclusion : To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that the BioLector has been used to track lipid production in real time and to monitor the growth of Y. lipolytica. The present study also showed the efficacy of the BioLector in screening growing conditions and engineered strains prior to scale-up. The method described here could be applied to <b>other</b> <b>oleaginous</b> microorganisms...|$|R
40|$|In {{last ten}} years (1998 - 2007), the area planted to coconut in the world (average 12 Mha) has shown a {{decreasing}} trend (average 1 %/year). World coconut oil production has remained at {{more or less the}} same level in the {{last ten years}} (average 3 MT/year). The study of the coconut commodity chain in Ghana show that this sector is confronted with many constraints: the inadequacy price of coconut oil and the competition with <b>other</b> <b>oleaginous</b> plants; an aging coconut plantation; the impacts of the coconut yellow lethal disease, an important demand in peeled nuts towards Nigeria market and the weak dynamism of its institutional organization. Four commodity chains are moving together: the commodity chains of the processing of traditional and semi-industrial coconut oil produce little added value. The commodity of fresh nuts produces a higher added value with limited urban market. Finally, the recent export of peeled nuts commodity chain towards Nigeria offers a large market and brings an important added value to the smallholders. Despite a replanting project in hybrid coconuts, the rehabilitation/ replanting of coconut plantation remains one of the challenges to deal with, in order to boost the coconut commodity chain in Ghana. The observation is that smallholders have not taken up the challenge after the public interventions have seized, in order to rehabilitate or replant their coconut trees. The strategy developed does not sufficiently lay on the market signal which today has evolved. The improved material available and the tested technologies should allow the boosting of the production sector and the reduction of the vulnerable conditions of household affected or threaten by the disease. The same way, the divergent strategies of stakeholders of the coconut commodity chain in Ghana slow down the dynamic of reorientation of this sector towards the export of peeled nuts. Producers in particular, should take advantage of this lucrative commodity chain. It is about all the stakeholders having interest in this commodity chain by preserving the coconut oil sector, which shows an economic, but also considerable social dimension. The boost of this production passes necessarily through the support function of the production and through professional organizations of producers...|$|R
40|$|Mortierella alpina, a {{oleaginous}} filamentous fungus, is one {{of industrial}} fungal strains known {{for the production of}} arachidonic acid. It is also of particular interest for hydrocarbon biofuel production since it is able to produce up to 50 % of its mass in rich, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFA’s]. In addition to high fatty acid production, M. alpina like many <b>other</b> <b>oleaginous</b> fungi, already have mechanisms for accumulating significant concentrations of hydrophobic compounds making it a naturally equipped candidate to handle potential toxic concentrations of hydrocarbons. To date, three different transformation methods have been established for M. alpina that are capable of sporulation. These are particle bombardment, chemical, and Agrobacterium-mediated transformations. However, many M. alpina strains, such as M. alpina ATCC 3222, are poor or absent of sporulation, of which have only protective coats, and the much less penetrable plant cell wall, yet remain of interest for their high lipid production. The goal {{of this study was to}} develop an efficient transformation method for those strains, hence allowing researchers to further manipulate these fungi for further improvement of lipid production. Included was optimization of best culture medium for growth and maintenance, optimal conditions for protoplast generation, and replacement of the homologous KusA gene. In molecular principle, homologous recombination is the most efficient method of disrupting, modifying, or replacing a target gene. This integration of exogenous DNA does not come readily to most organisms. Capitalizing from prior research efforts, it is known that deletion of KusA increases the rate of homologous recombination up to 100 % in Neurospora strains (Ninomiya 2004). The kusA gene deletion vector, comprised of three different DNA fragments, namely the upstream region of KusA gene, the antibiotic selection marker and downstream region of KusA gene, was assembled by yeast-gap repair method. The gene deletion vector yeast genomic DNA mixtures were rescued by E. coli transformation. The isolated plasmid DNA was confirmed by PCR and digested with endonuclease restriction enzyme PmeI for M. alpina transformation. The protoplast isolation was optimized by adjustment of the enzymes concentration and protoplast buffers. The optimization of protoplast transformation is still undergoing. A successful deletion of KusA gene within biotechnologically important M. alpina could enable homologous recombination of other genes of interest in a higher frequency. This capacity may also improve the advancing the production of microbial oils for bioenergy and arachidonic acid human health applications...|$|R
