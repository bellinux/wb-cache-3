40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} increasing the transparency (precision) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> value relevant public signal about one dimension <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> profitability on the firm’s incentive to undertake investment, when the firm possesses two-dimensional private information about the final return from an investment project. When <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> private information is one-dimensional, greater transparency of the public signal unambiguously enhances investment efficiency. However, we show that when <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> private information is two-dimensional, the effect of enhanced transparency along merely one dimension of the firm’s profitability is ambiguous. The social value of more transparent public information that sheds light on just one dimension <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> profitability depends on the transparency of public information about the other dimension of the firm’s profitability. If the transparency of public information about one dimension <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> profitability is low, then increasing the transparency of public information about another dimension of the firm’s profitability may actually induce the firm to distort its investment more than the firm would under lower transparency. The result {{suggests that it is}} the totality of transparency along all (nor merely some) relevant dimensions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> profitability that is crucial in enhancing <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> investment efficiency...|$|R

5|$|Over {{the first}} months of the Second World War Norwegian {{neutrality}} was violated repeatedly in the air and at sea by both warring parties, most dramatically with the 16 February Altmark Incident in Jøssingfjorden. This, along with other incidents, and the lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> Norwegian response, led the warring parties to the impression that Norway could or would not effectively protect her neutrality. Initially the German view of Norwegian neutrality had been one of it being positive for the German war effort, allowing German merchant ships to transport cargo via Norwegian territorial waters without interference from the British.|$|E
5|$|The Hokie kickoff {{rolled into}} the end zone for a touchback, and North Carolina started its second drive of the half from its 20-yard line. The first play of the drive was a three-yard run, and it was {{followed}} by a six-yard pass from Keldorf to Linton. Needing a single yard for a first down, the Tar Heels rushed straight ahead and gained two yards and the first down at the 31-yard line. North Carolina continued to move the ball efficiently: Linton gained two yards on a rushing play, then Keldorf threw a short pass to Linton that gained 37 yards after Linton broke free of the Virginia Tech defense. The play resulted in a first down at the Virginia Tech 31-yard line. There, however, Keldorf was sacked for a three-yard loss. After the sack, Keldorf completed a 21-yard pass to Crumpler for a first down at the 13-yard line. Keldorf then attempted to scramble for a gain, but was stopped for no gain. That play was the final one of the quarter, which ended with North Carolina still in possession <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> lead, 283.|$|E

40|$|The {{central theme}} of this thesis is to develop methods of {{financial}} mathematics to understand the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> capital structure through observations of market prices of liquid securities written on the firm. Just as stock prices are <b>a</b> direct measure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> equity, other liquidly traded products such as options and credit default swaps (CDS) should also be indicators <b>of</b> aspects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> capital structure. We interpret the prices of these securities as the market’s revelation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> finan-cial status. In order not {{to enter into the}} complexity of balance sheet anatomy, we postulate a balance sheet as simple as Asset = Equity + Debt. Using mathemati-cal models based on the principles of arbitrage pricing theory, we demonstrate that this reduced picture is rich enough to reproduce CDS term structures and implied volatility surfaces that are consistent with market observations. Therefore, reverse engineering applied to market observations provides concise and crucial information of the capital structure. Our investigations into capital structure modeling gives rise to an innovative pric...|$|R
