5|$|Banksy's Better <b>Out</b> <b>Than</b> In {{series has}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Many fans raved over his work, flocking to each site everyday of the show.|$|E
5|$|Better <b>Out</b> <b>Than</b> In was a {{residency}} {{undertaken by}} pseudonymous graffiti artist and political activist Banksy in New York City during October 2013. Banksy unveiled {{at least one}} work of art daily, documenting it on both a dedicated website and an Instagram account. The majority of the works were stencil graffiti and chiefly political, a distinctive characteristic of Banksy. Other pieces and multimedia exhibits toyed with dark humor and satire.|$|E
5|$|In COPD, it {{may take}} longer to breathe <b>out</b> <b>than</b> to breathe in. Chest {{tightness}} may occur but is not common and {{may be caused by}} another problem. Those with obstructed airflow may have wheezing or decreased sounds with air entry on examination of the chest with a stethoscope. A barrel chest is a characteristic sign of COPD, but is relatively uncommon. Tripod positioning may occur as the disease worsens.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the works}} {{that make up the}} Better <b>Out</b> <b>Than</b> In series were defaced, some just hours after the piece was unveiled. At least one {{defacement}} was identified as done by a competing artist, OMAR NYC, who spray-painted over Banksy's red mylar balloon piece in Red Hook. OMAR NYC also defaced some of Banksy's work in May 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light {{travels to the}} distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way <b>out</b> <b>than</b> it {{is on its way}} back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.|$|E
5|$|If it was {{necessary}} to seize control of a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay siege. It was more efficient to starve the garrison <b>out</b> <b>than</b> to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an external source, the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day. On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally and would have been abandoned after the siege ended one way or another.|$|E

Furthermore, a review of online discussions suggests that Lexicon's titles contain far fewer [...] "disappointing" [...] titles. The library in 2015 also saw {{more than twice as many}} check <b>outs</b> <b>than</b> in 2014.|$|R

25|$|Gene {{insertion}} {{is cheaper}} to carry <b>out</b> <b>than</b> gene knockout. But as the silencing is sometimes non-specific and has off-target effects on other genes, it provides less reliable results. Animal host vectors also {{play an important}} role.|$|E

25|$|If the {{external}} partial {{pressure of the}} gas (in the lungs) is then reduced, more gas will diffuse <b>out</b> <b>than</b> in. This is a condition known as supersaturation. The gas will not necessarily form bubbles in the solvent at this stage, but supersaturation is necessary for bubble growth.|$|E
25|$|When the gas in {{a tissue}} is at a {{concentration}} where more diffuses <b>out</b> <b>than</b> in the tissue {{is said to}} be supersaturated with that gas relative to the surrounding tissues. Supersaturation can also be defined as when the combined partial pressures of gases dissolved in a tissue exceeds the total ambient pressure on the tissue, and there is a theoretical possibility of bubble formation or growth.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the vagaries}} of the cube tower, it can be very {{difficult}} to predict the outcome of any battle. Many cubes can be poured into the tower, while only a few may come out. During initial setup, armies from all players are added to the tower as well, so {{it is also possible that}} in some battles, more cubes come <b>out</b> <b>than</b> were poured in.|$|E

25|$|Furius was a consul with Gaius Flaminius in 223 BC, {{the third}} year of the Gallic War. Both consuls marched to Northern Italy. However, no sooner had they set <b>out,</b> <b>than</b> the aristocratic party at Rome devised a means for depriving Flaminius, who had earned their ire by passing an agrarian law as tribune of the plebs in 232, of his office.|$|E
25|$|Norwegian Air Lines {{announced}} {{the establishment of}} a seaplane route from Oslo and around the coast to Bergen ahead of the 1935 season. The city selected Breiviken as its preferred location, situated further <b>out</b> <b>than</b> the ultimate location. However, this site would require much work and a temporary location was needed. For this Kristiansholm was selected. A molo had been built there in 1920; this created difficulties for ship traffic in the area, but was a suitable location to anchor up a seaplane. The location was also suitable due to the vicinity of the city. Funding was granted from Bergen Municipality and a burned down lot at Sandvikstorget was selected.|$|E
25|$|Intramuscular {{electrical}} stimulation (IMES) of muscle tissue {{has been used}} in various experimental and clinical settings. The advantage to using an IMES system over a standard such as hypertonic saline is that IMES can be turned on and off. This allows the researcher to exert a much higher degree of control and precision in terms of the stimulus and the measurement of the response. The method is easier to carry <b>out</b> <b>than</b> the injection method as it does not require special training in how it should be used. The frequency of the electrical pulse can also be controlled. For most studies a frequency of about 10Hz is needed to stimulate both local and referred pain.|$|E

25|$|Many writers {{argue that}} the {{sacrifice}} bunt and stolen base are overused in baseball. Teams will often attempt these plays when the score is close. Writers for Baseball Prospectus often argue that teams are, on average, actually lowering their expected number of runs scored. They argue that stolen base attempts are not completed frequently {{enough for them to}} be beneficial to the offense. For sacrifice bunts, they {{argue that the}} team is giving up more by sacrificing an <b>out</b> <b>than</b> they gain by advancing a runner one base. Their thinking is derived from the grid of expected runs in an inning based on the outs and runner situation, which shows that the sacrifice is detrimental to a team given average players in most of the situations in which it is typically used.|$|E
25|$|Aquifers {{may occur}} at various depths. Those {{closer to the}} surface are not only {{more likely to be}} used for water supply and irrigation, but {{are also more likely to}} be topped up by the local rainfall. Many desert areas have {{limestone}} hills or mountains within them or close to them that can be exploited as groundwater resources. Part of the Atlas Mountains in North Africa, the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges between Syria and Lebanon, the Jebel Akhdar in Oman, parts of the Sierra Nevada and neighboring ranges in the United States' Southwest, have shallow aquifers that are exploited for their water. Overexploitation can lead to the exceeding of the practical sustained yield; i.e., more water is taken <b>out</b> <b>than</b> can be replenished. Along the coastlines of certain countries, such as Libya and Israel, increased water usage associated with population growth has caused a lowering of the water table and the subsequent contamination of the groundwater with saltwater from the sea.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} 2014 Lexus IS sports sedan {{launch in}} the US, 2 new {{television}} ads (Crowd, Color Shift) were produced by Lexus' agency of record, Team One, with Original music from Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh, and directed by Jonas Åkerlund. The 'Crowd' ad emphasizes that things designed to draw a crowd are good, but leaving the crowd behind is more rewarding. The 'Color Shift' ad shows it's more fun and exciting to blend <b>out</b> <b>than</b> blend in. The Two additional ads (This is Your Move, Intense) were created by Lexus' multicultural agency, Walton Isaacson, {{as part of the}} campaign. 'This is Your Move' was geared to the African-American audience, features Los Angeles Dodgers center fielder Matt Kemp as he searches for something that matches his ambitious and driven personality. 'Intense' is targeted to the Hispanic audience and follows a young couple as they experience the thrills of driving the redesigned IS 250.|$|E
