500|$|The song {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon its release. In his review for Breakaway, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of MSN considered [...] "Since U Been Gone", [...] "Walk Away", and [...] "You Found Me" [...] as {{the spine of}} the album. He added that the songs sound mainstream and youthful. Rohin of Blogcritics gave a positive response to the song, emphasizing that [...] "it is almost one of the best pieces of throwaway pop in recent history". He also thought that the song represents a song [...] "that you can roll down the windows <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>car</b> and proudly headbang your way through a yellow light somewhere on a suburban side street." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine thought that Clarkson did a good impression of Pat Benatar in [...] "Since U Been Gone". He concluded his review by emphasizing that Breakaway proves that Clarkson has successfully dodged the sophomore slump but [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] helped her establish her success. The staff of Slant Magazine later ranked [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] at number thirteen in their list of Best Singles of the Aughts, writing that the song proves Clarkson's powerful ability as a vocalist as well as her versatility as an artist.|$|E

2500|$|Art Fern was the [...] "Tea Time Movie" [...] announcer, whose {{theme song}} was [...] "Hooray for Hollywood". Carson once {{admitted}} on camera {{that this was}} his favorite character, based on late-afternoon TV hosts who would deliver commercials throughout the movie. Each sketch usually featured three long commercials interrupted by silent, four-second clips from antique films. When the camera returned from each clip, Art was always caught off-guard and immediately reminded viewers that they were watching a film favorite. The movies always had unlikely casts and even less likely titles: [...] "Slim Pickens, Patti Page, Duke Wayne, and Charlton Heston in another classic Western: 'Kiss My Saddle Horn'!" [...] Carson originally played the fast-talking huckster in his own voice (as Honest Bernie Schlock or Ralph Willie), and finally settled on a nasal, high-pitched, smarmy drone, reminiscent of Jackie Gleason's [...] "Reginald Van Gleason III" [...] character. The character, now permanently known as Art Fern, wore a lavish toupee, loud jackets, and a pencil mustache. Actress Carol Wayne became famous for her 100-plus appearances (1971–1982) as Art's buxom assistant, the Matinée Lady. While Art gave his spiel, she would enter the stage behind him. Art would react to her attractive body by wincing, loudly shouting [...] "Ho— leeeee!" [...] and turning almost everything she said into a sexual double entendre. After Carol Wayne's death in 1985, Carson kept Art Fern off the air {{for most of the}} next year, and finally hired Danuta Wesley and then Teresa Ganzel to play the Matinée Lady. Carson also used these sketches to poke fun at the intricate Los Angeles interstate system, using a pointer and map to give confusing directions to shoppers, often including points where he would unfold the cardboard map to point out, via the appropriate picture, when the shopper would arrive at [...] "the fork in the road". Another freeway routine in the same theme centered on the [...] "Slauson Cutoff", a slang term Carson popularized to describe the truncated Marina Freeway (which ended abrubtly at Slauson Avenue in Culver City). Art Fern would advise drivers to take a series of freeways until they reached the Slauson Cutoff, and would then advise them to [...] "Get out <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>car,</b> cut off your slauson, get back in your car," [...] often followed by peals of laughter from the audience, led by McMahon.|$|E

Cars and parts can be obtained by scanning barcodes and either receiving a car from the dealership or beating your opponent in a Pink Slip style race. Parts are also obtained the same as dealership cars, but are received from the Garage. Only one of each car and car part can be obtained. Hindrances can pop up anytime you scan a barcode in the form <b>of</b> losing <b>your</b> <b>car</b> to the police, being impounded or a modified car crashing into a tree and losing a part. Races involve beating the other opponent and also involve 5 Speed Gear changes.
