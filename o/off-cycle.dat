25|$|A notable {{example of}} the anion-binding {{mechanism}} is the hydrocyanation of imines catalyzed by Jacobsen’s amido-thiourea catalyst depicted in the below diagram. This reaction {{is also one of}} the most extensively studied through computational, spectroscopic, labeling and kinetic experiments. While direct addition of cyanide to a catalyst-bound imine was considered, an alternative mechanism involving formation of an iminium-cyanide ion pair controlled by catalyst was calculated to have a barrier that is lower by 20 kcal/mol. The proposed most likely mechanism begins with binding of the catalyst to HNC, which exists in equilibrium with HCN. This complex then protonates a molecule of imine, forming an iminium-cyanide ion pair with the catalyst binding and stabilizing the cyanide anion. The iminium is thought to also interact with the amide carbonyl on the catalyst molecule (see bifunctional catalysis below). The bound cyanide anion then rotates, and attacks the iminium through carbon. The investigators conclude that though imine-urea binding was observed through spectroscopy and was supported by early kinetic experiments, imine binding is <b>off-cycle</b> and all evidence points toward this mechanism involving thiourea-bound cyanide.|$|E

50|$|Most {{military}} vehicles, ships, and {{fighters are}} equipped with invisible energy shields. They deflect incoming attacks, though their protection is based on their flicker rate. Shields cannot run continuously, so instead they cycle on and off many times a second. A fixed percentage of attacks are rendered harmless due to their flicker rates, and higher quality shields have a better ratio of on-cycles to <b>off-cycles</b> when compared to low quality shields. However, shields have limitations beyond this. In grav tank battles the solid metal rounds fired by main gun/Gauss cannon are not affected by shields, as well as Thor satellite attacks and nuclear detonations.

The fast AID reaction overwhelms the slow one in the desorption yield for 300 KTs 650 K. It proceeds along a first-order kinetics with respect to the incident H flux. Based on the experimental results, both two AID reactions are suggested to occur only on the 3 × 1 dihydride phase accumulated during surface exposure to H atoms.

This paper discusses two such systems for cooling and dehumidification applications: one with a separate preconditioning unit and one with separate ventilation and return air paths in a single unit. Both deep-cool and deep-dry the incoming air before mixing it with the return air, thereby eliminating the latent load on the primary cooling coil.

5000|$|Proponents of mayoral {{control point}} to two major reasons for {{shifting}} from an elected to appointed governance structure: {{the benefits of}} a single point of accountability and the power of sustained, aligned leadership. On the point of accountability, supporters of mayoral control point to the extremely low turnout for often <b>off-cycle</b> school board elections as evidence of the lack of school board accountability and relevance. [...] Expounding on this point, Finn and Keegan point out that in districts under mayoral control, [...] "there is now a single, publicly accountable official in charge, rather than nine wannabe mayors immobilizing the school system with their petty squabbles, power grabs, and turf protecting. If citizens are unhappy with the schools, they can now vote the mayor out of office. This does not eliminate democratic control over the schools; it rechannels—and strengthens—it". Former appointed CEO of the mayoral controlled Chicago Public Schools and U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan has made his support for mayoral control of schools clear, offering his help to mayors who push to gain sole leadership of the schools within their cities. [...] His support is also rooted in a belief that one point of accountability—the mayor—is far more effective than accountability spread across an elected board of education model.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} {{reactions}} proposed to proceed through anion-binding catalysis is the Pictet-Spengler-type cyclization of hydroxylactams with TMSCl under thiourea catalysis. In the proposed mechanism, after initial substitution of the hydroxyl group with chloride, the key ion pair is formed. The activated iminium ion is {{closely associated with the}} chiral thiourea-bound chloride, and intramolecular cyclization proceeds with high stereoselectivity.Asymmetric ion pairs can also be attacked in intermolecular reactions. In an interesting example, asymmetric addition of enol silane nucleophiles to oxocarbenium ions can be effected by catalytically forming the oxocarbenium through anion binding. Starting from an acetal, the chloroether is generated with boron trichloride and reacted with the enol silane and catalyst. The mechanism of formation of the oxocarbenium-thiourea-chloride complex is not fully resolved. It is thought that under the reaction conditions, the chloroether can epimerize and thiourea can stereoselectively bind chloride to form a closely associated ion pair. This asymmetric ion pair is then attacked by the silane to generate alkylated product.A notable example of the anion-binding mechanism is the hydrocyanation of imines catalyzed by Jacobsen’s amido-thiourea catalyst depicted in the below diagram. This reaction {{is also one of the}} most extensively studied through computational, spectroscopic, labeling and kinetic experiments.

The flue damper was expected to reduce <b>off-cycle</b> standby losses, which would lead to improvements in the efficiency of the water heater. The test results showed that the Energy Factor of the baseline water heater was 0. 576. The recovery efficiency was 0. 768. The standby heat loss coefficient was 10. 619 (BTU/hr-oF). After the damper was installed, the test results show an Energy Factor for the baseline water heater of 0. 605. The recovery efficiency was 0. 786. The standby heat loss coefficient was 9. 135 (BTU/hr-oF). The recovery efficiency increased 2. 3 percent and the standby heat loss coefficient decreased 14 percent.

40|$|This report {{identifies}} and quantifies the cycling {{losses in}} a domestic refrigerator-freezer. During cycling operation the refrigerator {{was found to}} operate between 5 and 25 % less efficient then the corresponding quasisteady machine. The cycling refrigerator operates with an evaporator capacity between 3 and 17 % less than the quasi-steady refrigerator, {{while at the same}} time requiring between 1 and 9 % more power to operate. This refrigerator performance degradation was attributed to several factors, the most important being the refrigerant migration and the thermal mass of the evaporator and compressor. During the <b>off-cycle</b> refrigerant migrates from the condenser to the evaporator as the system pressures equalize. The <b>off-cycle</b> migration increases the temperature of the evaporator and necessitates refrigerant redistribution during the on-cycle, and thereby tends to reduce system performance. The increased power requirements, traced to the compressor, result from slight differences in system pressure and the reduced compressor efficiency due to a cool compressor. With the cycling losses identified, several possible refrigerator design changes were suggested. It appears that a refrigerator equipped with a reciprocating compressor, solenoid valves to isolate the condenser, and no accumulator should operate in a nearly quasi-steady manner. In addition using the condenser fan to accelerate charge redistribution was investigated. However, since the experimental refrigerator was equipped with an accumulator which held up some charge manipulating the condenser fan showed little payoff.

40|$|TRANSIMS is a {{simulation}} {{system for the}} analysis of transportation options in metropolitan areas. Its major functional components are: (1) a population disaggregation module, (2) a travel planning module, (3) a regional microsimulation module, and (4) an environmental module. In addition to the major functional components, it includes a strong underpinning of simulation science and an analyst`s toolbox. The purpose of the environmental module is to translate traveler behavior into consequent air quality. The environmental module uses information from the TRANSIMS planner and the microsimulation and it supports the analyst`s toolbox. Transportation systems {{play a significant role in}} urban air quality, energy consumption and carbon-dioxide emissions. Recently, it has been found that current systems for estimating emissions of pollutants from transportation devices lead to significant inaccuracies. Most of the existing emission modules use very aggregate representations of traveler behavior and attempt to estimate emissions on typical driving cycles. However, recent data suggest that typical driving cycles produce relatively low emissions with most emissions coming from <b>off-cycle</b> driving, cold-starts, malfunctioning vehicles, and evaporative emissions. Furthermore, some portions of the <b>off-cycle</b> driving such as climbing steep grades are apt to be correlated with major meteorological features such as downslope winds.

40|$|Automotive {{air-conditioning}} is a {{high impact}} technology where improvements in energy consumption and environmental performance can make {{a significant difference in}} fuel efficiency and comfort. The mandatory phase out of R 134 a as refrigerant in the European Union has set the stage for new systems and alternative refrigerants. While some of these refrigerants, such as R 152 a or R 290, have a low Global Warming Potential, their flammability requires secondary loop systems to be used. The added thermal mass of such systems may increase power consumption and delay cool down while benefitting thermal comfort during start/stop operation. The recent revival of electric vehicles, as well as the associated focus on air-conditioning energy consumption, provides new challenges and opportunities. This research focuses on the performance evaluation of refrigerants R 152 a and R 290 during transient operation in secondary loop systems, quantification of thermal storage benefits for start/stop operation, and investigation of energy saving potentials in electric vehicles through the use of advanced air-conditioning system controls and cabin preconditioning. A test facility was built to dynamically test secondary loop systems over a wide range of pull down conditions and drive cycles using a passenger cabin model and associated controls. It was shown that R 290 is a viable alternative in secondary loop systems and system performance may be on par or better compared to R 134 a direct expansion systems.

Importantly, {{we are able to}} detect alkene cation radical intermediates, and confirm that phenylthiyl radical is capable of oxidizing the persistent acridinyl radical in a fast process that unites the catalytic activity of the photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) manifolds. Additionally, we present evidence that diphenyl disulfide ((PhS) 2) operates on a common catalytic cycle with thiophenol (PhSH) by way of photolytic cleaveage of the disulfide bond. Transition structure analysis of the HAT step using DFT reveals that the activation barrier for H atom donation from PhSH is significantly lower than 2 -phenylmalononitrile (PMN) due to structural reorganization.

Here we present a detailed experimental study that elucidates the factors contributing to the broad aldehyde scope and high reactivity. A variety of catalytically relevant intermediates were isolated and a [Rh(dcpm) (vinylphenolate) ] complex was identified as the major catalytically relevant species. A variety of <b>off-cycle</b> intermediates were also identified that can re-enter the catalytic cycle by substrate- or 1, 5 -cyclooctadiene-mediated pathways.
