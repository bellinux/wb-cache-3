As for my punishment, not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> place myself in the Lord's hands, but I would argue that any government would recognise the legitimacy of my action."

500|$|His {{appointment}} {{to command the}} 6th Division meant that Mackay led its—and the Australian Army's—first battles of the war. Doubts about Mackay's ability soon disappeared with {{the commitment of the}} division to Operation Compass. During the Battle of Bardia, in Libya in January 1941, the 6th Division captured the fortified town along with 36,000 Italian prisoners. For this success, Mackay was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). In a war of rapid movement over long distances, Mackay demonstrated careful planning and recognised the need to reinforce success. He also impressed others with the way he cared for soldiers' lives. [...] "Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> want Tobruk quickly", he told his brigadiers before the battle, [...] "but I also want it cheaply". The victory at Bardia was followed by successes at Tobruk, Derna and Benghazi.|$|E

Abdul initially dismissed Clark's claims as lies, saying that she would not [...] "dignify Clark's claims with a response", explaining, [...] "Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> never lie, I never respond to lies". The show's other judges and some of the show's former contestants also expressed disbelief of Clark's claims, which Clark saw as an attempt by Abdul, the show, and the network to cover up the matter.|$|E

[...] She felt a kinship with this classic writer of the Carmelite Order (though nothing seems to have drawn her to the writing of Teresa of Avila), and with enthusiasm she read his works, The Ascent of Mount Carmel, [...] the Way of Purification, the Spiritual Canticle, [...] the Living Flame of Love.
