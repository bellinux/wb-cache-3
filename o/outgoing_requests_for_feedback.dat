This paper also investigates the vlog viewers’ perception regarding the importance of openings and closings in vlogs. Frobenius’s (2011) taxonomy of opening strategies and Coronel-Molina’s (1998) closing strategies are used as the framework for analyzing the data. Qualitative research is {{used to examine the}} data, which consists of 30 monologue vlogs from YouTube. The openings and closings of the vloggers are analysed using Conversation Analysis (CA). This approach facilitates the transcription of their monologues and the study {{of the structure of the}} openings and closings. Meanwhile, 40 viewers are interviewed online to obtain their opinions of opening and closing sequences. Content analysis is employed to inspect the responses of the viewers as it allows the extraction of lexical items that reflect their opinions. Apart from Frobenius’s (2011) strategies, the Malaysian vloggers used four other types of opening strategies: small talk, pleasantries, <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>feedback</b> and apologies. They also used three other closing strategies, which are not found in Coronel-Molina’s (1998) data: apologies, <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>feedback</b> and self-identification. Such findings suggest that opening and closing strategies are influenced by social and cultural expectations. Furthermore, the interview results show that Malaysian viewers generally consider opening and closing sequences important as they believe these sequences serve necessary functions.

This paper reports qualitative findings of an interprofessional intervention designed to improve {{communication and}} collaboration between different professions in general internal medicine (GIM) hospital wards in Canada. The intervention promoted self-introduction by role and profession to a collaborating colleague {{in relation to the}} shared patient, a question or communication regarding the patient, to be followed by an explicit <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>feedback</b> from the partner professional. Implementation and uptake of the intervention were evaluated using qualitative methods, including 90 hours of ethnographic observations and interviews collected in both intervention and comparison wards. Documentary data were also collected and analysed. Fieldnotes and interviews were transcribed and analysed thematically. Our findings suggested that the intervention did not produce the anticipated changes in communication and collaboration between health professionals, and allowed us to identify barriers to the implementation of effective collaboration interventions. Despite initially offering verbal support, senior physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals minimally explained the intervention to their junior colleagues and rarely role-modelled or reiterated support for it. Professional resistances as well as the fast paced, interruptive environment reduced opportunities or incentive to enhance restrictive interprofessional relationships. In a healthcare setting where face-to-face spontaneous interprofessional communication is not hostile but is rare and impersonal, the perceived benefits of improvement are insufficient to implement simple and potentially beneficial communication changes, in the face of habit, and absence of continued senior clinician and management support...|$|R

The Licensed Building Practitioner’s Scheme (LBP) is another government initiative prompted by criticism of the systemic deficiencies within the NZ building industry by the 2002 Hunn Report.

40|$|This draft {{outlines}} {{an optional}} Quick-Start mechanism for transport protocols to determine an optional allowed initial congestion window or initial sending rate {{at the start}} of a data transfer. This mechanism is designed to be used by a range of transport protocols; however, in this document we only describe its use with TCP and IPv 4. By using Quick-Start, a TCP host, say, host A, would indicate its desired initial sending rate in packets per second in a Quick Start Request option in the IP header of the initial TCP SYN or SYN/ACK packet. Each router in turn could either approve the specified initial rate, reduce the specified initial rate, or indicate that nothing above the default initial rate for that protocol would be allowed. The Quick-Start mechanism also can determine if there are routers along the path that do not understand the Quick Start Request option, or have not agreed to the initial rate described in the option. If all of the routers along the path have agreed to the initial rate in the Quick-Start Request, then TCP host B communicates this to TCP host A in a transport-level Quick-Start Response in the answering SYN/ACK or ACK packet. Quick-Start is designed to allow TCP connections to use high initial windows in circumstances when there is significant unused bandwidth along the path, and all of the routers along the path support the Quick-Start Request. We note that this is currently not a mature proposal, but an outline of one possible path of development in the IP protocol, and a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>feedback</b> from the community...|$|R

LLNL's efforts in FY 06 included: (1) Development of a systems code for Z-IFE and use of the code to examine the operating parameter space in terms of design variables such as the Z-pinch driver energy, the chamber pulse repetition rate, the number of chambers making up the power plant, and the total net electric power of the plant. This is covered in Section 3 with full documentation of the model in Appendix A. (2) Continued development of innovative concepts for the design and operation of the recyclable transmission line (RTL) and chamber for Z-IFE. The work, which builds on our FY 04 and FY 05 contributions, emphasizes design features that are likely to lead to a more attractive power plant including: liquid jets to protect all structures from direct exposure to neutrons, rapid insertion of the RTL to maximize the potential chamber rep-rate, and use of cast flibe for the RTL to reduce recycling and remanufacturing costs and power needs. See Section 4 and Appendix B.
