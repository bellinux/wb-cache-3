5|$|The {{policy of}} this Government is universally known. The {{people of the}} United States are opposed to predatory {{activities}} no matter whether they are carried on {{by the use of}} force or by the threat of force. They are likewise <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> form of intervention on the part of one state, however powerful, in the domestic concerns of any other sovereign state, however weak.|$|E
5|$|However, Newcastle and his Lieutenant General, Lord Eythin, were <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> pitched {{battle and}} {{possibly}} offended by Rupert's high-handed attitude. Rather than join Rupert immediately they temporised, claiming {{that it would}} take time to clear the earth and rubble which had been used to block the city gates of York during the siege. Newcastle's soldiers in York then refused to fight unless given their delayed payment, a dispute which Eythin may have fomented. A number were also absent, pillaging the abandoned allied siege works and encampments outside the city, and had yet to return.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, the Buddhist Uprising {{erupted in}} central Vietnam, {{in which some}} Buddhist leaders fomented civil unrest against the war, hoping to end foreign {{involvement}} in Vietnam and end the conflict through a peace deal with the communists. The VNQDD remained implacably <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> coexistence with the communists. Members of the VNQDD made alliances with Catholics, collected arms, and engaged in pro-war street clashes with the Buddhists, forcing elements of the ARVN to intervene to stop them.|$|E

They disagree with knowledge specialisation and the split of university study objects. They also <b>oppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> commercial involvement of corporations within studies and academic research.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>opposing</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> {{means of}} revolutionary changes, the Kaliszanie {{eventually}} supported the November Uprising {{and joined the}} ranks of the National Government in 1830. During the period of struggle against Russia the Kaliszanie practically dominated the government, controlling the ministries of internal affairs, treasury and war. Following the fall of the uprising in 1831, most of its members had to flee Poland and continued their political activities abroad, notably in London and Paris.|$|R

The Adass Jeschurun <b>oppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> concession <b>to</b> Christian rituals. So there is no burial in a coffin or urn. Also flower decorations or wreath are not common. The tombstones of the cemetery are very sober and predominantly engraved with Hebrew letters. Entry is not open to the public. (A permit must be asked to the Synagogengemeinde Köln) ...|$|R
5|$|Millicent Mehitabel Mudd, {{better known}} as Millie, is a ten-year-old red fox girl who is Ozy's best friend. Millie is usually seen wearing a set of blue denim overalls. Unlike Ozy, who is calm, Millie is chaotic and manic, both in the {{destruction}} she leaves behind and the ways she devises of avoiding work. She is a rebel and is <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> form of authority, which regularly leads to confrontations with both her teacher, Ms. Sorkowitz, and her mother, Mililani Mudd. Her destructive and rebellious habits not only get herself into trouble, but Ozy too.|$|E
5|$|Shoup's {{opposition}} to the war only increased over time; he initially pushed for a negotiated settlement but later supported a unilateral pullout from the country. As the Vietnamization strategy took effect and the U.S. increased its air operations, he remained <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> strategy that risked a nuclear war with China or the Soviet Union. His criticism attracted more press as the war became a stalemate. It also became highly publicized through discourse among the anti-war movement.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{over the}} Security Council {{resolution}} were initially contentious, as the U.S., the UK, and France submitted a draft resolution that included automatic invocation of Chapter VII, sanctioning {{use of military}} force if Syria did not fulfill its commitments under the agreement. Russia and China were <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> resolution that authorized enforcement under Chapter VII without a second vote of the Security Council. After further negotiations, on 26 September the five permanent members of the UN Security Council reached agreement on an implementation and enforcement draft resolution. On the following day, just hours after the OPCW Executive Council approved a detailed implementation plan for the U.S./Russian Framework, Security Council Resolution 2118 was unanimously passed, making the OPCW plan binding on the Syrians.|$|E

60|$|But why, {{might the}} lawyer reply, should rights founded on {{hereditary}} succession yield any more readily {{in the case}} of government than {{in the case of}} property? The distribution of property influences the general welfare quite as much as the management of power. Suppose it were proved that the general welfare of your parish would be promoted by the division of your land among the destitute there. You have nothing <b>to</b> <b>oppose</b> <b>to</b> such a proposition but your hereditary right. And the king has that <b>to</b> <b>oppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> plan of a division of his prerogatives and powers among the people who would like to share them.|$|R

5|$|In December, Kan Ek' {{despatched}} AjChan {{to negotiate}} peace with Spain, with three Itza companions. They were accompanied to Mérida {{by a small}} number of Mopans from the Tipuj region. AjChan, through family ties and marriage, had a key role as a middleman between the Itza, Yalain and Kowoj; he also had family ties with the semi-Christianised Maya at Tipuj, and his mother was from Chichen Itza in the northern Yucatán. His marriage to a Kowoj woman had been an attempt, ultimately unsuccessful, to defuse Itza–Kowoj hostility. Kan Ek' sent AjChan to Mérida with a message of peaceful submission to the Spanish Empire in an attempt to solidify his own position as sole ruler of the Itza, even if this meant sacrificing Itza independence from Spain. The Itza king's uncle and the Kowoj were fundamentally <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> negotiations with the Spanish and viewed AjChan's embassy as treachery. The Spanish were unaware of the tensions between different Maya factions in central Petén, which by now had escalated into a state of inter-Maya warfare. AjChan was baptised as Martín Francisco on 31 December 1695, with Martín de Ursúa, governor of Yucatán, acting as his godfather.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{parliamentary}} reform plummeted {{after the}} launch of the French Revolution in 1789. Many English politicians became steadfastly <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> major political change. Despite this reaction, several Radical Movement groups were established to agitate for reform. A group of Whigs led by James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale and Charles Grey founded an organisation advocating parliamentary reform in 1792. This group, known as the Society of the Friends of the People, included 28 MPs. In 1793, Grey presented to the House of Commons a petition from the Friends of the People, outlining abuses of the system and demanding change. He did not propose any specific scheme of reform, but merely a motion that the House inquire into possible improvements. Parliament's reaction to the French Revolution was so negative, that even this request for an inquiry was rejected by a margin of almost 200 votes. Grey tried to raise the subject again in 1797, but the House again rebuffed him by a majority of over 150.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} held oral {{hearings in}} Spring 2005 and received an unexpectedly {{large volume of}} written submissions with at least 60% being <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> constitutional changes to marriage or the family, including from members of Pro Life Campaign, Family Solidarity and Mother and Child Campaign. The final report, the Tenth interim report of the committee, was launched by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on 24 January 2006. It recommended no change to the constitutional definitions, as it expected such a referendum to fail. It suggested that there should instead be legislation for a civil partnership registration open to same-sex or opposite-sex couples which would confer succession, maintenance and taxation rights. Controversially, it also recommended that the 'presumed' recognition of cohabiting partners by the courts, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, should also be legislated for, but only for opposite-sex couples. The basis for the limitation {{was that it would}} be easy for the courts to determine the validity of an opposite-sex relationship if there were children.|$|E
5000|$|The Hastings Pier & White Rock Trust [...] was {{established}} to raise funds through various means to renovate the pier, ranging from community fund raising (cup collecting, raffles and quiz nights etc.) to larger scale grant applications. Their long-term goal is to acquire the pier and form a not-for-profit company to renovate, reopen and revitalise the pier as a community owned asset. The Hastings Pier and White Rock Trust (HPWRT) strongly <b>oppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> decision <b>to</b> demolish and clear {{the site of the}} structure, which would cost an estimated £4 million of local money.|$|R

5|$|When {{the force}} marched west in 1873, it brought twenty-five British Army 1868 pattern lances {{along on the}} {{expedition}} to impress the Blackfoot First Nation. The force also used swords, with the 1822 pattern British Light Cavalry sabre approved for commissioned officers, and the non-commissioned officers carrying the British 1853 pattern weapon; some constables unofficially equipped themselves with swords, despite Commissioner French having doubts about their utility. The policy around the carrying of these weapons was reviewed in 1880, due to concerns that swords were no longer practical in conflicts with the First Nations. Commissioner Irvine wanted to equip all of his force with swords for use in close quarter combat, while the authorities in Ottawa were <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> extension; as a compromise, some 1822 pattern swords were purchased for storage in the police armouries. In 1882, non-commissioned officers were authorised to carry the 1822 pattern sabre, and commissioned police officers adopted the new British 1896 pattern cavalry sword when it was issued a few years later. The mounted police deployed to Siberia {{at the end of}} the First World War carried the 1908 pattern cavalry sword.|$|E
