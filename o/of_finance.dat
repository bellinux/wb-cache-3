5|$|During Western Han, the Minister of Finance's {{powers were}} limited to the public treasury, the Minister Steward being {{responsible}} for the emperor's private wealth.

During Western Han, the Minister <b>of</b> <b>Finance</b> managed the government's monopolized salt and iron agencies, which were abolished during Eastern Han and transferred to local administrations and private entrepreneurship. He also managed the government's brief monopoly over liquor from 98–81 BC, before it was returned to private production.
