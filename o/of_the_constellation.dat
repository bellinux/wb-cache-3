5|$|In Arabic {{astronomy}} Coma Berenices {{was known}} as Al-Dafira and Al-Hulba (translations of Ptolemaic Plokamos), forming the tuft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> Leo and including most of the Flamsteed-designated stars (particularly 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 and 21 Comae Berenices). Ulugh Beg, however, regarded Al-Dafira as consisting of two stars, 7 and 23 Comae Berenices. Presently Al-Dafira is the proper name of Beta Comae Berenices.|$|E
40|$|This papers {{considers}} <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> a mutiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{communication system}} with channel knowledge at the transmitter and receiver. The design methods {{available in the}} literature have addressed the following two aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem: a) choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> symbol <b>constellations</b> for a given transmission scheme or b) choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optimal (linear) precoder and equalizer for a given choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>constellations.</b> More specifically, <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> has been made enforcing a diagonal, or parallel, transmission. However, in practice, <b>the</b> two problems <b>of</b> choosing <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> and <b>the</b> linear precoder/equalizer are clearly coupled, and the diagonal structure may not be necessarily the best. This paper attempts to provide a global view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem by bridging {{the gap between the}} existing results on <b>the</b> selection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> and on <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signal processing in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a linear transceiver (i. e., precoding at the transmitter and equalization at the receiver) ...|$|R

5|$|Gamma Comae Berenices (15 Comae Berenices) is an orange-hued giant {{star with}} a {{magnitude}} of 4.4 and a spectral class of K1III C.

With Alpha Comae Berenices and Beta Comae Berenices, Gamma Comae Berenices forms a 45-degree isosceles triangle from which Berenice's imaginary tresses hang.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{northern}} edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> and just southwest of Achernar is Alpha Hydri, a white sub-giant star of magnitude 2.9, situated 72 light-years from Earth. Of spectral type F0IV, it is beginning to cool and enlarge as it uses up its supply of hydrogen. It is twice as massive and 3.3 times as wide as our sun and 26 times more luminous. A line drawn between Alpha Hydri and Beta Centauri is bisected by the south celestial pole.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{within the}} bounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> is the {{gigantic}} Phoenix cluster, which is around 7.3 million light years wide and 5.7 billion light years away, {{making it one of}} the most massive galaxy clusters.

Larger still is El Gordo, or officially ACT-CL J0102-4915, whose discovery was announced in 2012.

5|$|Orion served several {{roles in}} ancient Greek culture.

5|$|The Aurigids are {{normally}} a placid Class II meteor shower that {{peaks in the}} early morning hours of September 1, beginning on August 28 every year.

5|$|At a {{distance}} of , Epsilon Eridani is the 13th-nearest known star (and ninth nearest solitary star or stellar system) to the Sun as of 2014. Its proximity makes {{it one of the}} most studied stars of its spectral type. Epsilon Eridani is located in the northern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> Eridanus, about 3° east of the slightly brighter star Delta Eridani. With a declination of −9.46°, Epsilon Eridani can be viewed from much of Earth's surface, at suitable times of year. Only to the north of latitude 80°N is it permanently hidden below the horizon. The apparent magnitude of 3.73 can make it difficult to observe from an urban area with the unaided eye, because the night skies over cities are obscured by light pollution.|$|E
5|$|Auriga, however, is {{sometimes}} described as Myrtilus, who was Hermes's {{son and the}} charioteer of Oenomaus. The association of Auriga and Myrtilus is supported by depictions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>constellation,</b> which rarely show a chariot. Myrtilus's chariot was destroyed in a race intended for suitors to win the heart of Oenomaus's daughter Hippodamia. Myrtilus earned his position in the sky when Hippodamia's successful suitor, Pelops, killed him, despite his complicity in helping Pelops win her hand. After his death, Myrtilus's father Hermes placed him in the sky. Yet another mythological association of Auriga is Theseus's son Hippolytus. He was ejected from Athens after he refused the romantic advances of his stepmother Phaedra, who committed suicide as a result. He was killed when his chariot was wrecked, but revived by Asclepius. Regardless of Auriga's specific representation, {{it is likely that}} the constellation was created by the ancient Greeks to commemorate the importance of the chariot in their society.|$|E

Andromeda is most prominent during autumn evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, along with several other constellations named for characters in the Perseus myth. Because of its northern declination, Andromeda is visible only north of 40° south latitude; for observers farther south it lies below the horizon.
