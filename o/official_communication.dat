5|$|At the Potsdam Conference in Germany, Truman was {{informed}} that the Trinity test had been successful. He told Stalin, {{the leader of the}} Soviet Union, that the US had a new superweapon, without giving any details. This was the first <b>official</b> <b>communication</b> to the Soviet Union about the bomb, but Stalin already knew about it from spies. With the authorization to use the bomb against Japan already given, no alternatives were considered after the Japanese rejection of the Potsdam Declaration.|$|E

5|$|On October 5, Secretary of State Robert Lansing was {{the first}} {{official}} to propose that Marshall forcibly assume presidential powers and duties. Other cabinet secretaries backed Lansing's request, as did Congressional leaders, including members of both the Democratic and Republican parties who sent private communications to Marshall. Marshall was cautious in accepting their offers of support. After consulting {{with his wife and}} his long-time personal adviser, Mark Thistlethwaite, he privately refused to assume Wilson's duties and become Acting President of the United States. The process for declaring a president incapacitated was unclear at that time, and he feared the precedent that might be set if he forcibly removed Wilson from his powers and duties. Marshall wanted the president to voluntarily allow his powers to devolve to the vice president, but that was impossible given his condition and unlikely given Wilson's dislike for Marshall. Marshall informed the cabinet that the only cases in which he would assume Wilson's powers and duties were a joint resolution of Congress calling on him to do so, or an <b>official</b> <b>communication</b> from Wilson or his staff asserting his inability to perform his duties.|$|E

25|$|Sulfonamide {{drugs were}} the first {{antibiotics}} to be used systemically, and {{paved the way for}} the antibiotic revolution in medicine. The first sulfonamide, trade-named Prontosil, was a prodrug. Experiments with Prontosil began in 1932 in the laboratories of Bayer AG, at that time a component of the huge German chemical trust IG Farben. The Bayer team believed that coal-tar dyes which are able to bind preferentially to bacteria and parasites might be used to attack harmful organisms in the body. After years of fruitless trial-and-error work on hundreds of dyes, a team led by physician/researcher Gerhard Domagk (working under the general direction of Farben executive Heinrich Hörlein) finally found one that worked: a red dye synthesized by Bayer chemist Josef Klarer that had remarkable effects on stopping some bacterial infections in mice. The first <b>official</b> <b>communication</b> about the breakthrough discovery was not published until 1935, more than two years after the drug was patented by Klarer and his research partner Fritz Mietzsch.|$|E

500|$|President Wilson {{experienced}} a mild stroke in September 1919. On October 2, {{he was struck}} by a much more severe stroke that left him partially paralyzed and almost certainly incapacitated. Wilson's closest adviser, Joseph Tumulty, did not believe Marshall would be a suitable acting president and took precautions to prevent him from assuming presidential powers and duties. Wilson's wife Edith strongly disliked Marshall because of what she called his [...] "uncouthed" [...] disposition, and also opposed his assumption of presidential powers and duties. [...] Tumulty and the First Lady believed that an <b>official</b> <b>communication</b> from Wilson's staff on his condition would allow Marshall to trigger the constitutional mechanism allowing him to become acting president, and made sure no such communication occurred. After Marshall demanded to know Wilson's status so that he could prepare for the possibility of becoming president, they had a reporter from the Baltimore Sun brief Marshall and inform him that Wilson was near death. Marshall later said that [...] "it was the first great shock of my life", but without an <b>official</b> <b>communication</b> on Wilson's condition, he didn't believe he could constitutionally assume presidential powers and duties.|$|E

[...] The bill was put through a joint conference of both houses of the General Assembly and funds where voted to purchase a printer to create the seal.|$|E

In 1929 he left the police service when he was caught stealing examination solutions from a teaching superior's office.

500|$|After news arrived of the Confederate {{victory at}} Bull Run, Yancey {{attempted}} to arrange another meeting with Russell, {{but he was}} forced to present his arguments in writing. [...] Doyle argues that Yancey blundered badly by extolling the benefits of slavery to the world in general and Britain in particular. In an August 24 response directed to the representatives [...] "of the so-styled Confederate States of America", [...] Russell merely reiterated the previous determination to remain neutral. Critics maintain that the Yancey mission failed to adequately exploit openings presented by Union Secretary of State William Seward’s antagonist attitude towards Great Britain or to address British concerns concerning the effect of the war on Great Britain. [...] In late August, with little else to do, Yancey submitted his resignation but, due to the events of the Trent Affair, Yancey did not leave until his replacements, James M. Mason and John Slidell (selected by President Davis in July before he was aware of Yancey’s intent), arrived in January 1862.
