In these studies, sisal fibers {{are used in the}} preparation of bio-based composites and in the derivatization of the pulp, including posterior preparation of films. This study aimed to examine the use of sisal pulp in the production <b>of</b> <b>bioethanol,</b> <b>which</b> can potentially be a high efficiency process because of the cellulose content of this fiber. A previous paper addressed the hydrolysis of sisal pulp using sulfuric acid as a catalyst. In the present study, the influence of the mercerization process on the acid hydrolysis of sisal pulp was evaluated. Mercerization was achieved in a 20 % wt NaOH solution, and the cellulosic pulp was suspended and vigorously mixed for 1, 2 and 3 h, at 50 A degrees C. The previously characterized mercerized pulps were hydrolyzed (100 A degrees C, 30 % H 2 SO 4, v/v), and the results are compared with those obtained for unmercerized pulp (described in a companion paper). The starting sample was characterized by viscometry, alpha-cellulose content, crystallinity index and scanning electron microscopy. During the reactions, aliquots were withdrawn, and the liquor was analyzed by HPLC. The residual pulps (non-hydrolyzed) were also characterized by the techniques described for the initial sample. The results revealed that pretreatment decreases the polyoses content as well as causes a decrease of up to 23 % in the crystallinity and up to 21 % in the average molar mass of cellulose after 3 h of mercerization. The mercerization process proved to be very important to achieve the final target. Under the same reaction conditions (30 % and 100 A degrees C, 6 h), the hydrolysis of mercerized pulp generated yields of up to 50 % more glucose. The results of this paper will be compared with the results of subsequent studies obtained using other acids, and enzymes, as catalysts.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued by some that the {{substitution}} of biofuels for gasoline could increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, rather than reduce them. The increase is attributed to the indirect land use change effects of planting new grain and corn crops {{around the world to}} replace those progressively being devoted to ethanol production. In this paper, indirect effects are minimised by allowing land to be used for both food and fuel, rather than for one or the other. We present a sugarcane ‘feed+fuel’ biorefinery, <b>which</b> produces <b>bioethanol</b> and yeast biomass, a source of single-cell protein (SCP), that {{can be used as a}} high-protein animal feed supplement. The yeast SCP can partially substitute for grass in the feed of cattle grazing on pasture and thereby potentially release land for increased sugarcane production, with minimal land use change effects. Applying the concept conservatively to the Brazilian ethanol and livestock industry our model demonstrates that it would be technically feasible to raise ethanol production threefold from the current level of 27 GL to over 92 GL. The extra ethanol would meet biofuel market mandates in the US without bringing any extra land into agricultural or pastoral use.

40|$|The first pilot-scale {{factories}} for {{the production}} of bioethanol from lignocellulose have been installed, indicating that we are on the brink of overcoming most hurdles for an economically feasible process. When bioethanol is competitive as biofuel with fuels originating from petrochemical resources, it will also become interesting to use lignocellulose as a feedstock for the fermentative synthesis of bulk chemicals. Lignocellulose hydrolysates, however, are highly complex and viscous media, posing challenges to oxygen transfer, product formation at low sugar concentration, product recovery, etc. Bioethanol is an exceptional product in this respect because it can be produced anaerobically, at low sugar concentrations, and can be easily removed from the broth by distillation. For products that do not have these benefits, another approach may be interesting, in which lignocellulose is first converted to <b>bioethanol,</b> <b>which</b> in turn serves as a substrate for a second conversion into the desired product, similar to the traditional production of acetic acid in vinegar.
