5000|$|A {{lookback option}} is a path {{dependent}} option where the <b>option</b> <b>owner</b> {{has the right}} to buy (sell) the underlying instrument at its lowest (highest) price over some preceding period.|$|E
5000|$|A {{call option}} {{can also be}} sold even if the option writer ("A") doesn't own the stock at all. This is called a [...] "naked call". It is more dangerous, as the option writer can later be forced to buy the stock at the then-current market price, then sell it {{immediately}} to the <b>option</b> <b>owner</b> at the low strike price (if the naked option is ever exercised).|$|E
50|$|If the {{underlying}} stock's market price {{is below the}} option's strike price when expiration arrives, the <b>option</b> <b>owner</b> (buyer) can exercise the put option, forcing the writer to buy {{the underlying}} stock at the strike price. That allows the exerciser (buyer) {{to profit from the}} difference between the stock's market price and the option's strike price. But if the stock's market price is above the option's strike price at the end of expiration day, the option expires worthless, and the owner's loss is limited to the premium (fee) paid for it (the writer's profit).|$|E

40|$|A {{call option}} on a stock {{is a common}} and widely used derivative. On an average trading day in 2015, more than 800, 000 such options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the largest options {{exchange}} in the United States. Each <b>option</b> grants its <b>owner</b> {{the right to buy}} 100 of a specific stock at a pre-specified price, no later than a pre-specified date. For example, an option can grant the right to buy 100 General Electric shares for USD 31 each no later than October 21, 2016. An interesting issue is determining when an option is optimally exercised. Merton (1973) shows that in a world without frictions, a call option should never be exercised early, but only at expiration or just before the underlying stock pays a dividend. Chapter one of this thesis shows that suffciently severe frictions can make early exercise optimal. Short-sale costs especially represent an important driver of early exercise. Chapter two shows that when <b>option</b> <b>owners</b> exercise early, it predicts stock returns, consistent with <b>option</b> <b>owners</b> acting on private information. Chapter three does not include options but shows that demand shifts in the shorting market for stocks predict the volatility of the affected stocks, which is consistent with increases in differences of opinions among market participants...|$|R
50|$|The <b>owner</b> of an <b>option</b> {{contract}} has {{the right}} to exercise it, and thus require that the financial transaction specified by the contract is to be carried out immediately between the two parties, whereupon the option contract is terminated. When exercising a call <b>option,</b> the <b>owner</b> of the <b>option</b> purchases the underlying shares (or commodities, fixed interest securities, etc.) at the strike price from the option seller, while for a put <b>option,</b> the <b>owner</b> of the <b>option</b> sells the underlying to the option seller, again at the strike price.|$|R
40|$|We adopt a {{quadratic}} {{approach to}} the valuation of the option to exchange one asset for another, when the <b>option</b> <b>owner</b> {{has the right to}} exercise before option expiration. Accurate pricing results are obtained and tested against competitive models in the literature, building on the hypothesis that option value is the product of two functions, one being a function of time and the other one being a function of the stock prices. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the pricing of electricity swing options that hedge the electricity price risk and also partly the risks in the option owner's load pattern. The swing derivative sets boundaries for the purchased {{power and energy}} and it specifies the price at which the <b>option</b> <b>owner</b> can buy energy. The name swing option {{comes from the fact}} that the power usage is allowed to swing between the lower and upper boundaries. We show that the swing options can be priced and hedged by using regular electricity forwards and call options...|$|E
50|$|With {{the real}} estate call <b>option,</b> {{property}} <b>owner</b> can sell an option in exchange for debt-free cash today. Investor, who buys {{the real estate}} call option benefits from property price appreciation and price volatility.|$|R
50|$|The put buyer either {{believes}} that the underlying asset's price will fall by the exercise date or hopes to protect a long position in it. The advantage of buying a put over short selling the asset is that the <b>option</b> <b>owner's</b> risk of loss {{is limited to the}} premium paid for it, whereas the asset short seller's risk of loss is unlimited (its price can rise greatly, in fact, in theory it can rise infinitely, and such a rise is the short seller's loss). The put buyer's prospect (risk) of gain is limited to the option's strike price less the underlying's spot price and the premium/fee paid for it.|$|R
40|$|XVA is a {{material}} {{component of a}} trade valuation and hence it must impact the decision to exercise options within a given netting set. This is true for both unsecured trades and secured / cleared trades where KVA and MVA play {{a material}} role even if CVA and FVA do not. However, this effect has frequently been ignored in XVA models and indeed in exercise decisions made by <b>option</b> <b>owners.</b> This paper describes how XVA impacts the exercise decision and how this can be readily evaluated using regression techniques (Longstaff and Schwartz 2001). The paper then assesses the materiality {{of the impact of}} XVA at the exercise boundary on swaption examples. Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures, 3 table...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a model of}} investment timing by managers in a decentralized firm {{in the presence of}} agency conflicts and information asymmetries. When investment decisions are delegated to managers, contracts must be designed to provide incentives for managers to both extend effort and truthfully reveal private information. Using a real options approach, we show that an underlying option to invest can be decomposed into two components: a manager’s <b>option</b> and an <b>owner’s</b> <b>option.</b> The implied investment behavior differs significantly from that of the first-best no-agency solution. In particular, there will be greater inertia in investment, as the model predicts that the manager will have a more valuable option to wait than the owner...|$|R
40|$|An {{economic}} model {{was developed to}} analyze the put option contract role to stabilize prices in the paddy market. The possibility of using Federal Government Acquisitions (AGF) to complement the option instrument was considered. The role of the options was to reduce the risks of storing the product for later sale. The model is applied to analyze the option instrument implementation in the 2004 / 05 season. A two week demand for rice was estimated for the Brazilian market. The {{results show that the}} market prices go up when the government acts through the AGF. The options serve the purpose of making prices follow a compatible path. It was estimated that the probability for the <b>option</b> <b>owners</b> exercise their <b>options</b> is greater when the AGF are not used. One can conclude that these two tools (AGF and put options) {{can be used in a}} complementary way, with the AGF raising the market prices in the harvesting period, and the put option contracts making sure that the prices follow a competitive path and reduce the risks of future prices.

5000|$|Options are {{contracts}} {{that give the}} owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy (in {{the case of a}} call option) or sell (in the case of a put option) an asset. The price at which the sale takes place is known as the strike price, and is specified at the time the parties enter into the option. The option contract also specifies a maturity date. In the case of a European <b>option,</b> the <b>owner</b> has the right to require the sale to take place on (but not before) the maturity date; {{in the case of an}} American <b>option,</b> the <b>owner</b> can require the sale to take place at any time up to the maturity date. If the owner of the contract exercises this right, the counter-party has the obligation to carry out the transaction. Options are of two types: call option and put option. The buyer of a call option has a right to buy a certain quantity of the underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no obligation to carry out this right. Similarly, the buyer of a put option has the right to sell a certain quantity of an underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no obligation to carry out this right.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, a novel {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} {{to solve a}} cooperative multi-depot vehicle routing problem. We establish a mathematical model for multi-owner VRP in which each owner (i.e. player) manages single or multiple depots. The basic idea consists of offering an <b>option</b> that <b>owners</b> cooperatively manage the VRP to save their costs. We present cooperative game theory techniques for cost saving allocations which are obtained from various coalitions of owners. The methodology is illustrated with a numerical example in which different coalitions of the players are evaluated along {{with the results of}} cooperation and cost saving allocation methods.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a model of}} optimal investment timing in a decentralized firm under conditions of agency and asymmetric information. Using a real options approach, we show that an underlying option to invest can be decomposed into two components: a manager’s <b>option</b> and an <b>owner’s</b> <b>option.</b> The terms of the manager’s option are determined by an optimal contracting model, and provide an incentive for the manager to both extend effort and truthfully reveal his private information. The implied investment behavior differs significantly from that of standard real options models. In particular, there will be greater inertia in investment, in that the model leads to the manager having an even greater “option to wait ” than the owner. The interplay between the twin forces of hidden information and hidden action leads to markedly different investment outcomes than when {{only one of the}} two forces is at work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we study}} two {{dimensional}} maintenance contracts for {{a fleet of}} dump trucks operated in a mining industry. The two-dimensional contract is charaterised by two parameters (i. e. age and usage limits) which define a region. Two different shapes of the contract region are studied, where one region favors the customer, and the other the service provider. The maintenance service contracts studied is the performance based contract which offers incentives to motivate a service provider (an agent) to increase the equipment’s performance beyond the target. This in turn gives benefit for both {{the owner of the}} trucks and the agent of service contract. The decision problem under study is that an agent offers several two dimensional service contract <b>options</b> and the <b>owner</b> of the trucks has to select the optimal option. We use a Nash game theory formulation in order to obtain a win-win solution – i. e. the optimal strategy (pricing structure) for the agent and the optimal <b>option</b> for the <b>owner.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|Homeownership is an {{enduring}} and fundamental American tradition whose {{economic and social}} benefits are well examined and have received renewed attention in recent articles and books. Tax laws encourage homeownership; debtor-creditor and property laws protect homeowners; and constitutional protections defend homeowners from governmental attempts to exercise eminent domain. The current economic and housing crises have forced commentators and policymakers to reexamine the connection between traditional conceptions of homeownership and economic stability, particularly for low-income residents. This article questions that traditional conception by exploring how local governments, {{in an effort to}} promote regulatory land use goals, frequently limit homeowners 2 ̆ 7 power to freely alienate property. In particular, I consider state and local efforts to restrict residential real estate rentals and to curb residential real estate speculation. In so doing, I attempt to strike the proper balance of legal protections concerning homeownership. Do we over protect traditional conceptions of homeownership {{at the expense of other}} important values? If the answer is yes, then do limitations on owners 2 ̆ 7 alienation rights achieve worthwhile goals? Or are we perhaps offering owners too little in terms of ownership <b>options?</b> <b>Owners</b> may need more flexibility in the compromise between shelter and commodity, or between on-site and off-site risk factors. These questions of 2 ̆ 2 too much 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 too little 2 ̆ 2 suggest that the issues of rental restrictions and limits on speculation are ones that jurisdictions will soon be compelled to reconsider...|$|R
