5|$|Bismuth is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBi and atomic number 83. Bismuth, a pentavalent post-transition metal {{and one of}} the pnictogens, chemically resembles its lighter homologs arsenic and antimony. Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead. It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but surface oxidation can give it a pink tinge. Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic element, and has <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> values of thermal conductivity among metals.|$|E
