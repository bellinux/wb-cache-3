By mid-1945, the object was to produce 1,000 detonators each week. Meeting this target proved challenging. Reliability was the key problem, with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers <b>of</b> <b>failures.</b> In May 1945, a box of detonators manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and tumbled down a mountain side, but were found to still be in working order.|$|E

5|$|England won {{the second}} Test; after both teams' first innings were low-scoring, Peel, {{appearing}} at number six, batted for 150 {{minutes in the}} second innings to score 53 without hitting any fours. Stoddart's 173 set Australia a big target, and Peel took four for 77 to bowl England to a 94-run win. Australia won the third Test by 382 runs; Peel took four wickets in the game, but was dismissed in both innings without scoring. It is possible that around this time, Peel was threatened by Stoddart with expulsion from the tour owing to his drinking. Australia won the fourth Test to level the series at 2â€“2. In very favourable bowling conditions, Peel took three for 74 but Australia totalled 284. England were bowled out twice to give Australia an innings victory, and Peel suffered his second consecutive pair (i.e. failing to score in either innings). He was {{the first player to}} score four successive ducks in Test cricket, a succession <b>of</b> <b>failures</b> not repeated until 1936, and this remained the record number of successive ducks until 1985.|$|E

5|$|The {{long-term}} success of implants is determined, in part, {{by the forces}} they have to support. As implants have no periodontal ligament, there is no sensation of pressure when biting so the forces created are higher. To offset this, the location of implants must distribute forces evenly across the prosthetics they support. Concentrated forces can result in fracture of the bridgework, implant components, or loss of bone adjacent the implant. The ultimate location of implants is based on both biologic (bone type, vital structures, health) and mechanical factors. Implants placed in thicker, stronger bone like that found in the front part of the bottom jaw have lower failure rates than implants placed in lower density bone, such as the back part of the upper jaw. People who grind their teeth also increase the force on implants and increase the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>failures.</b>|$|E

Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints are already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed <b>of</b> <b>failures</b> made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E
5|$|Wet {{weather in}} the {{following}} two years affected playing conditions, making the cricket pitches slow-paced and difficult to bat on. With little experience of such conditions, MacLaren had a succession <b>of</b> <b>failures.</b> His technique, based at the time on playing forward at the ball, was unsuited to wet pitches {{and it was only}} late in 1889 that he made the required technical adjustments and learned to play off the back foot (i.e. stepping backwards to play a shot). During 1890, his final year at Harrow, he captained the team and had his most successful season, scoring over 500 runs at an average of 42.54. In the match against Eton at Lord's, MacLaren once more succeeded when others struggled, and he scored 76 on a difficult pitch. In his four years at Harrow, MacLaren was twice awarded the prize for the school's best batsman, and received awards for his fielding. MacLaren also played football successfully: he captained his House team and played in the school first eleven in 1888 and 1889 before a knee injury forced him to miss the 1890 season. Unlike many of his fellow amateur cricketers in this period, MacLaren did not attend Oxford or Cambridge Universities, where he would have played a high level of cricket; his father could not afford to send him or his brothers there. On leaving Harrow, MacLaren found employment with the Manchester and Liverpool District Bank.|$|E

40|$|In entrepreneurship, {{the fear}} <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> has been {{identified}} as a significant barrier to entrepreneurial activity. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), the world's largest study of entrepreneurial activity, defines the fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> as a strong inhibitor for seizing opportunities and transforming entrepreneurial intentions into entrepreneurial actions. Contrary to entrepreneurship research, psychological theory offers a counterintuitive prediction of the outcomes <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> While early achievement theories argued that fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> inhibits behavior, later psychological research has found fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> to be dualistic in nature, sometimes motivating individuals to act while at other times inhibiting such action. Although there is no unified theory on fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> within the psychology literature, the theoretical background of this construct in entrepreneurship appears even more fragmented. An examination of the existing entrepreneurship literature on fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> reveals that scholars have used different definitions and measures to explain this phenomenon and investigate its effects on entrepreneurial behavior. Because these measures refer to a different nature of the fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> construct, it is very unlikely that they converge to capture the same phenomenon. Therefore, a clear understanding of the nature and effects <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> in entrepreneurship is needed. In this respect, this thesis addresses the research question of how fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> can be defined and measured within the entrepreneurial process. Three articles have been developed to answer this research question. In Article 1, the conceptual issues associated with the current status of the literature on fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> in entrepreneurship and the characteristics of the entrepreneurial setting that shape the fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> experience are discussed. Building on these conceptual observations, Article 2 adopts a qualitative approach to investigate the experience <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> antecedent and concurrent to the entrepreneurial process. Sixty-five entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs have been interviewed to show that fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> can be defined as a complex combination of cognition, affect, and behavior. Finally, in Article 3 four studies are conducted to develop and validate a new measure of entrepreneurial fear <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> Findings from these three articles shed light on the fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> construct in entrepreneurship, which emerged as a context-sensitive phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> has negative psychological and physiological effects on children in achievement settings. Perceiving the consequences <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> to be aversive provides the basis for fear <b>of</b> <b>failure,</b> and the anticipation of threatening outcome elicits fear. This thesis focuses on investigating fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> in the sport domain, specifically among young elite athletes. The first study (chapter 4) examined young athletes' (n= 9; ages 14 - 17 years) perceptions of the consequences <b>of</b> <b>failure,</b> the effects <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> on them, and their coping responses to the effects <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> Data analysis revealed that the most commonly perceived aversive consequences <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> were diminished perception of self, no sense of achievement, and the emotional cost <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> Fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> affected the athletes' well-being, interpersonal relationships, schoolwork, and sporting performance. They employed a combination of problem-focused, emotion-focused, and avoidance focused coping strategies, the latter being the most frequently reported strategy. Study 2 (chapter 5) aimed to examine the developmental origins <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> among young elite athletes. Three intact families of young elite athletes (ages 13 - 14 years) volunteered {{to participate in this}} study. Data analysis revealed three mechanisms <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> transmission: parental punitive behaviour, parental controlling behaviour, and parental expectations. The athletes and their parents reported common fears <b>of</b> <b>failure,</b> such as fears of negative judgment, of not attaining aspirations, of losing ranking, and of nonselection to future competitions. The study provided evidence to support an intergenerational transmission <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> from parents to young elite athletes through recurrent patterns of parent-child interaction. The third and final study (chapter 6) designed an intervention programme whose primary aim was to reduce young elite athletes' (n= 6, ages 13 - 15 years) fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> levels through parental training, and its secondary aim was to reduce their parents' fears <b>of</b> their child's <b>failure.</b> The intervention comprised two separate educational programmes. The first programme offered the parents (6 couples) a one-off educational seminar (Study 3 a) and the second programme offered a young elite athlete and her parents ten weekly one-to one intervention sessions (Study 3 b). Both programmes aimed to teach parents about fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> and about their {{role in the development of}} their child's FF, specifically addressing issues of parent-child communication and interaction. Cognitive-behavioural therapy provided the framework for the intervention. Findings from both programmes showed that the parents reduced their punitive behaviours and adopted more favourable ways of reacting to their child's failures. Both programmes showed that the athletes' and parents' fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> levels had decreased post-intervention. Avoidance motivation goals also decreased for most of the athletes. This research extends our knowledge on the FF phenomenon in the youth sport context, where research on FF has been greatly neglected. It provides the first scientific documentation of young elite athletes' perceptions of the consequences <b>of</b> <b>failure,</b> the effects <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> on them, and their coping responses to these effects. It also provides the first evidence to support intergenerational transmission <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> from parents to young elite athletes; thus, implicating parents in the developmental origins <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> in young elite athletes. The intervention programme offers the first documented scientific programme designed to reduce fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> levels <b>of</b> young elite athletes and their parents, thus, enhancing our knowledge about the treatment ofFF. The findings of this research can be used to inform assessment, diagnosis, and treatment off ear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> in sport. A better understanding of the fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> phenomenon in sport will enable sport psychologists to enhance young athletes' performances, well-being, and social development...|$|R
40|$|The success <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> {{analysis}} {{depends on}} the use of appropriate analytical techniques in proper sequence.

The unit of analysis is at country level. I categorize determinants into demographic, property rights, and procedural variables. A population of higher working age ratio (measured as the population aged 15 - 64 divided by the population aged 65 and over) correlates with a decreasing fear <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> Additionally, stronger property rights appear to decrease fear <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> I do not find a statistically significant relationship between fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> and procedural variables in my datasets.
