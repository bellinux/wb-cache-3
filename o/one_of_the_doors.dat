25|$|Following the Blitz, which {{destroyed}} {{the chamber of}} the House of Commons, the Lord's chamber was occupied by the Commons. The Lords temporarily used the Robing Room during the reconstruction. The State Opening Of Parliament was carried out as normal, with the new rooms being used. Evidence can still be seen of this today, with damage clearly visible on <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> where they were struck by Black Rod.|$|E
25|$|Rupert Gillmouthe, {{the sheriff}} of Hood River County at the time, {{suspected}} that the drilling rig had overturned the Martins' car {{at the bottom of}} the river, and dislodged <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> allowing the bodies of Susan and Virginia to escape and surface downstream. Further searches of the water were undertaken by both sonar and helicopter, but were unfruitful. The search for Kenneth, Barbara, and Barbie was subsequently suspended after a search diver nearly drowned.|$|E
25|$|Dark Fall was written, {{designed}} and programmed by Jonathan Boakes, {{who was working}} as a sushi chef at the time. He first got the idea for the game whilst exploring a real abandoned train station and adjoining hotel in Dorset in January 2000. The buildings were sealed shut with corrugated iron, but rusted peepholes allowed him to look inside and determine they had been quite opulent in their day, and had last been used in the late 1940s. Upon further investigation, he discovered <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of the train station was so rotted, the weight of the iron had pulled it partly off its hinges, {{and he was able to}} get inside and explore the buffet room.|$|E

50|$|Lexi {{has been}} {{involved}} in a car crash but is still alive. She walks home, still covered in the dust. Brad, who sees her, realizes she could infect both himself and Alvaro so he does not let her in. Lexi becomes desperate after being locked out. She loses her temper and throws her cell phone at <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> panes, breaking it. Brad and Alvaro both rush to cover up the breakage and seal it off. Together, they manage to calm Lexi down.|$|R
25|$|Histon School {{was started}} in 1722; in 1729 it gained funding from the {{foundation}} of Elizabeth March - a board over <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> to Histon church records this bequest. Histon’s share of this income was £14 a year. Until 1840 the school {{was held in the}} parish church, but then a purpose-built school was erected to hold up to 70 children in what is now called School Hill. In 1872 the school was enlarged; it was then held up as a model school for the whole county. On being taken over by the school board in 1893 it was enlarged still further {{with the addition of a}} new south wing, built over the Histon brook. In 1913 the school moved to its current site and the building was then handed back to the church and is now the church hall.|$|E
25|$|Numbers {{of doors}} {{are to be}} met with not only in churches but also in private houses. Lavenham, Suffolk, is rich in work of this latter class. In England the general custom was to carve {{the head of the}} door only with tracery (East Brent, Somerset), but in the Tudor period doors were some times covered entirely with linenfold {{paneling}} (St Albans Abbey). This form of decoration was exceedingly common on the Continent as well as in England. In France the doors towards {{the latter part of the}} 15th century were often square-headed, or perhaps had the corners rounded. These doors were usually divided into some six or eight oblong panels of more or less equal size. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of Bourges Cathedral is treated thus, the panels being filled in with very good tracery enriched with crockets and coats of arms. But a more restrained form of treatment is constantly employed, as at the church of St Godard, Rouen, where the upper panels only are carved with tracery and coats of arms and the lower adorned with simple linenfold design.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{performed}} [...] "Government Hooker" [...] at the Clinton Foundation's Decade of Difference {{celebration at}} the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California. The song {{was featured in}} a promotional video for the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards on August 18, 2011. [...] "Government Hooker" [...] was included on the setlist of the Born This Way Ball, Gaga's third headlining tour. The song was performed as the second song in the setlist, after [...] "Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)" [...] which opened the show. After a brief interlude Gaga appeared from <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> in the castle {{and walked down the}} castle steps. She preceded {{to take part in a}} sexual routine with one of her dancers. During the breakdown, Gaga pulled a gun out of a draw and shot the dancer and then sung the chorus one more time and telling the crowd, 'Welcome to the Born This Way Ball' and shot the castle gates open.|$|E

500|$|The prosecution's case rested {{largely on}} the {{testimony}} of two men who had pleaded guilty to participating in the holdup. The prosecution called four witnesses: Avon White and John Rivers (both of whom had already been convicted of the robbery) and the manager and teller of the bank. White and Rivers, although convicted, {{had not yet been}} sentenced for the robbery and were promised that the charges would be dropped in exchange for their testimony. White and Rivers testified that Shakur had guarded <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> with a [...]357 magnum pistol and that Sadiki had served as a lookout and drove the getaway truck during the robbery; neither White nor Rivers was cross-examined due to the defense attorney's refusal to participate in the trial. Shakur's aunt and lawyer, Evelyn Williams, was also cited for contempt after walking out of the courtroom after many of her attempted motions were denied. The trial was delayed for a few days after Shakur was diagnosed with pleurisy.|$|E
2500|$|Elementary {{comparison}} of contestant's strategies shows that, for every strategy A, {{there is another}} strategy B [...] "pick a door then switch no matter what happens" [...] that dominates it (Gnedin, 2011). No matter how the car is hidden and no matter which rule the host uses when he has a choice between two goats, if A wins the car then B also does. For example, strategy A [...] "pick door 1 then always stick with it" [...] {{is dominated by the}} strategy B [...] "pick door 2 then always switch after the host reveals a door": A wins when door 1 conceals the car, while B wins when <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> 2 and 3 conceals the car.|$|E
2500|$|In the 8th and 9th centuries, the iconoclast {{movement}} caused {{serious political}} unrest throughout the Empire. The emperor Leo III issued a decree in 726 against images, {{and ordered the}} destruction of a statue of Christ over <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of the Chalke, an act that was fiercely resisted by the citizens. Constantine V convoked a church council in 754, which condemned the worship of images, after which many treasures were broken, burned, or painted over with depictions of trees, birds or animals: One source refers to the church of the Holy Virgin at Blachernae as having been transformed into a [...] "fruit store and aviary". Following the death of her son Leo IV in 780, the empress Irene restored the veneration of images through the agency of the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.|$|E

2500|$|On 5 May 2013, it was {{reported}} that the House had been [...] "completely redesigned". On 23 May 2013, it was confirmed that the house would be 'Eco' in design. The series was expected to show the objective of self-sufficiency and recycling throughout and this was represented throughout the house. Inside the house, as housemates entered, they were greeted by a huge wall containing recycled life-sized doors. Behind <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> was the Diary Room; a housemate could call to talk to Big Brother in this room {{from the bottom of the}} stairs. Inside the Diary Room was a metallic based chair, layered in slim red padding. Outside of the Diary Room, there was a sweeping staircase leading down to an eco-living room with producers desperate to make the housemates experience 'hell in a hell house'. The living room contained different coloured sofas and chairs and a plasma television. Beside the living room, there was a circular style kitchen for housemates to use. The housemates could store their food items and utensils obtained from the adjacent store room in a purpose-built cow. There was a round table for housemates to sit at and eat together at. Beside the living room, there was a small toilet, and the bedroom. The bedroom was colourful in design this year, and introduced a bike which powered the hair dryers and hair straighteners when active. Both the bedroom and the living area led out into the garden. This series, the garden had a barred prison for any housemates that misbehaved, as well as a treehouse for housemates to get cosy in and it included the returning vegetable patch which was last seen in Big Brother 4. Housemates had to shower outside; with one housemate having to spin a wheel that powered the only shower. The traditional mangle also made its return to the house. House pictures were officially unveiled in the Daily Star on 10 June 2013.|$|E
