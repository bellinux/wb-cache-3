The bridge stands on 26 uniform segmental arches consisting of a double, radially laid course <b>of</b> <b>bricks.</b> At the eastern end, the original 27tharch {{has been replaced by}} two smaller, semicircular arches of later construction. The latter are built with a single course <b>of</b> <b>bricks.</b> Traces of the original, flat beginning of the collapsed arch are still visible on the piers.|$|E

Three different types <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> were received from the field; two types <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> produced by two traditional technologies <b>of</b> handmade <b>brick</b> production and one type <b>of</b> old <b>brick,</b> collected after an old house de-construction. All three types <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> were tested in the KPL laboratory of UL FGG. Standard tests were carried out, such as determination of size and dimensions, flatness and parallelism of surfaces, different types of water absorption and compressive strength. For the first two types <b>of</b> <b>brick,</b> also soil for brick production, called loam, was taken in-situ. Basic soil tests were carried out on these two specimens, i. e. grain size distribution and Attenberg limits of plasticity. Soil tests were carried out at the Chair of Soil Mechanics with Laboratory. The diploma work describes brick testing procedures, along with obtained results. Results obtained for the three different types <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> are compared...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Brick wall collapses {{contributing}} to occupational fatalities constantly happen to construction-related workers. The {{number of workers}} involved in brick wall collapse accidents is more than that in other accident types. The brick wall collapse accidents accounted for 93 % of the structure collapse cases, and about 64 % <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> wall collapse cases are in connection with demolition <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> walls. In order {{to find out the}} major risks <b>of</b> demolition <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> walls, this article examines occupational accident statistics and case reports from the Northern Region Inspection Office of the Council of Labor Affairs of Taiwan. Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA) is employed to discuss the collapse behavior for demolition <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> walls. A procedure during the demolition <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> walls is suggested for the purpose of safety...|$|R

5|$|During World War II, Hungarian {{mathematician}} Pál Turán {{was forced}} {{to work in a}} brick factory, pushing wagon loads <b>of</b> <b>bricks</b> from kilns to storage sites. The factory had tracks from each kiln to each storage site, and the wagons were harder to push at the points where tracks crossed each other. Turán was inspired by this situation to ask how the factory might be redesigned to minimize the number of crossings between these tracks.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{significant}} reclamation {{on the two}} sites very little evidence remains of the power stations, other than a small number <b>of</b> <b>bricks</b> and steel rods. Some minor structures have survived to the North West of the North station's site, including a road bridge over the rail line which served the station, a brick wall, and a concrete staircase. More obvious remains of the power stations are their three large sub-stations that still supply the local region. Much of this electrical power is generated in Scotland's Cockenzie power station, transported via a 275 kilovolt (kV) and a 400 kV connection.|$|E
5|$|Functionalism, {{which began}} in the 1930s, relied on {{rational}} architecture making use <b>of</b> <b>bricks,</b> concrete, iron and glass, preferably to meet social needs. Its main proponents in Denmark were Frits Schlegel, Mogens Lassen, Vilhelm Lauritzen and, especially Arne Jacobsen with his Bellavista developments north of Copenhagen. Another of Jacobsen's masterpieces was the Aarhus City Hall which he designed together with Erik Møller in 1937 and completed in 1948. The tower is 60 meters tall and the tower clock face has a diameter of 7 meters. The building is made of concrete plated with marble from Porsgrunn in Norway.|$|E

40|$|The current {{article is}} focused at {{efflorescence}} formation and durability <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> masonry. The chemical and phase composition, microstructure <b>of</b> efflorescence on <b>brick</b> and masonry mortar on exterior walls of buildings are studied. Improved properties <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> masonry for external walls of buildings are {{achieved by the}} use of masonry mortar based on multi-component cement, which contains zeolite. It is shown that the use of multi-component cement with low clinker content in the mortar reduces the content of calcium hydroxide and SO 3. It is determined that synergistic combination of mineral additives of different groups with substantial reduction of cement clinker in cements containing zeolite, improves durability <b>of</b> <b>brick</b> masonry without efflorescence formation. Physic-chemical modification of mortar by complex air-entraining admixture allows obtaining high-quality modified mortars with improved quality parameters.

5|$|Outside {{the temple}} {{building}} proper was the temple enclosure, {{surrounded by a}} rectangular brick wall that symbolically protected the sacred space from outside disorder. On occasion this function was more than symbolic, especially during the last native dynasties {{in the fourth century}} BC, when the walls were fully fortified in case of Persian invasion. In late temples these walls frequently had alternating concave and convex courses <b>of</b> <b>bricks,</b> so that the top of the wall undulated vertically. This pattern may have been meant to evoke the mythological waters of chaos.|$|E

5|$|The {{line was}} heavily {{used for the}} {{shipment}} <b>of</b> <b>bricks</b> from the brickworks around Brill, and of cattle and milk from the dairy farms on the Wotton estate. By 1875 the line was carrying around 40,000gallons (180,000l; 48,000USgal) of milk each year. Delivery of linseed cake to the dairy farms and of coal to the area's buildings were also important uses of the line. The line also began to carry large quantities of manure from London to the area's farms, carrying 3,200tons (3,300t) in 1872. As {{it was the only}} physical link between the Tramway and the national railway network, almost all of this traffic passed through Quainton Road station.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth of}} the River Brue had an {{extensive}} harbour in Roman and Saxon times, before silting up in the medieval period. It was used again as a small harbour in the 17th and 18th centuries, and in 1833 the port of Highbridge was formally opened on the river. A new wharf, known as Clyce Wharf, {{was built on the}} Huntspill side of the river mouth by 1904, and was used for the import of coal and the export <b>of</b> <b>bricks</b> and tiles and agricultural products. The port closed in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{mainstay}} of the Malagasy economy. Land {{is used for the}} cultivation of rice and other crops, raising of zebu and other livestock, the fabrication <b>of</b> <b>bricks</b> and other traditional livelihoods. In Antananarivo, access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every resident of the city. The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply and much of the unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city. This uncontrolled development poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas.|$|E

5|$|Bridgwater was {{developed}} during the Industrial Revolution as the area's leading port. The River Parrett was navigable by large ships as far as Bridgwater. Cargoes were then loaded onto smaller boats at Langport Quay, next to the Bridgwater Bridge, to be carried further up river to Langport; or they could turn off at Burrowbridge and then travel via the River Tone to Taunton. The Parrett is now only navigable as far as Dunball Wharf. Bridgwater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, was a centre for the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>bricks</b> and clay roof tiles, and later cellophane, but those industries have now stopped. With its good links to the motorway system, Bridgwater has developed as a distribution hub for companies such as Argos, Toolstation, Morrisons and Gerber Juice. AgustaWestland manufactures helicopters in Yeovil, and Normalair Garratt, builder of aircraft oxygen systems, is also based in the town. Many towns have encouraged small-scale light industries, such as Crewkerne's Ariel Motor Company, one of the UK's smallest car manufacturers.|$|E

The {{original}} Church of St. Peter was completed {{in the summer of}} 1850, and the first mass in that building was held on August15. The church was not officially incorporated until April29, 1865. A newer, larger building was constructed in 1876, on the same road as the village's rail depot. The new building followed an English Gothic architecture style. It was made <b>of</b> <b>bricks,</b> created near the North River, and was ornamented with yellow bricks from Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and sandstone from Amherst, New York. The first mass in the new church occurred on December25, 1876; the building's total construction cost was $31,000.

5|$|Few records survive of the Brill Brick and Tile Works, {{as it came}} to be called, but it was {{operational}} by 1895.

This is almost certainly incorrect; no mention of the sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill Brick and Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895. The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making high numbers <b>of</b> <b>bricks</b> along the Tramway.|$|E
