50|$|David Hale, the {{key witness}} against President Clinton in Starr's Whitewater investigation, alleged in November 1992 that Clinton, while {{governor}} of Arkansas, pressured him {{to provide an}} illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, <b>the</b> partner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clintons</b> in <b>the</b> Whitewater deal.|$|R
5|$|For the sub-plot {{about the}} morning-after pill, former Clinton {{economic}} advisor Gene Sperling {{was brought in}} for consultation. Such a drug, called Mifepristone, was in fact approved in the United States in September 2000; {{one of the last}} months <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> presidency. Also the political issues related to Haiti have close parallels to an episode in the Clinton presidency: the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power by the United States in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 and 2000, Moran faced Republican {{and flat}} tax {{advocate}} Demaris H. Miller.

5|$|The White House {{travel office}} controversy, {{sometimes}} referred to as Travelgate, was the first major ethics controversy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> administration. It began in May 1993, when seven employees of the White House Travel Office were fired.

5|$|Preston Leslie {{was born}} in Clinton County, Kentucky (then a part of Wayne County), on March 8, 1819. He was the second son of Vachel H. and Sarah Hopkins Leslie. He was educated in the public schools, then studied law under Judge Rice Maxey. He worked with his father on the family farm until 1835, and {{supported}} himself by doing odd jobs including driving a stagecoach, running a ferry, and being store clerk. Leslie {{was admitted to the}} bar on October 10, 1840, and served as the deputy clerk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> County courts.

He was hired to be the manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Giants in 1992. Clinton was the Class-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants at the time. Stein led Clinton to a 59–79 record that year. After considering taking a year off of baseball in 1994, Stein eventually accepted the managerial position with the independent league Tyler WildCatters.|$|E

5|$|The {{administration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Laboratories {{passed from}} Monsanto to the University of Chicago in May 1947, {{and then to}} Union Carbide in December 1947. The Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, recommended that all work on reactors be concentrated at the Argonne National Laboratory, the successor to the Metallurgical Laboratory, near Chicago. There was also competition for staff and resources from the newly established Brookhaven National Laboratory near New York. Morale was low, {{and no one could}} be found to take on the job of Director of Research at the laboratory, renamed the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in January 1948. At least six people turned down the job before Union Carbide's acting Director, Nelson (Bunny) Rucker, asked Weinberg to become Director of Research in March 1948.|$|E
5|$|From 1943 to 1945, he coordinated Manhattan Project work on {{plutonium}} purification and production.

Shortly before the war ended, he took over the management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Laboratories in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Monsanto pulled out of Oak Ridge in December 1947, but became the operator of the Mound Laboratories in 1948. Secretary of State Dean Acheson appointed Thomas to serve on a 1946 panel to appraise international atomic inspection, which culminated in the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In 1953 he was appointed as a consultant to the National Security Council, and served as U.S. Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E
5|$|In the January 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton {{proposed}} a new initiative {{to provide health}} coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy—a Democrat—and Orrin Hatch—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act {{and two years later}} she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. He negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth. In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Clinton made {{reform of the}} Arkansas {{education}} system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was also an attorney {{as well as the}} chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session—the longest in Arkansas history. Many have considered this the greatest achievement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> governorship. He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).|$|E
5|$|In the upland {{parts of}} the {{watershed}} of Mahoning Creek, 95 percent of the rock is sedimentary rock, mainly of the Trimmers Rock Formation, the Clinton Group, the Catskill Formation, the Hamilton Group, the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation, the Onondaga and Old Port Formation, and the Wills Creek Formation. The Catskill Formation occurs in a large area in the northeastern part of the watershed and the Trimmers Rock Formation occurs {{in the rest of}} the northern part of the watershed and in the southernmost part of the watershed. The Hamilton Group is to the south of the northern area of the Trimmers Rock Formation and to the north of the southern area of the formation. The Onondaga and Old Port Formation occurs south of the Hamilton Group and near Sechler Run, as does the Keyser and Tonoloway Formation. The Wills Creek Formation is found in the central part of the watershed, as is the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation. The Clinton Group occurs south of these formations and south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Group is more of the aforementioned formations.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 1993, Clinton {{made a major}} {{speech to}} Congress {{regarding}} a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This {{was one of the}} most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris stated that the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House. Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> administration.|$|E

The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation. Critics contended that the firings {{had been done to}} allow friends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clintons</b> to take over the travel business and <b>the</b> involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FBI was unwarranted.|$|R
