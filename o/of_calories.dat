5|$|The Pizza Burger is {{a burger}} sold {{exclusively}} at the BK Whopper Bar location in Times Square, New York City that {{was introduced in}} September 2010. It consists of four Whopper patties on a 9.5inch sesame bun, sliced into six pieces and topped with pepperoni, mozzarella, basil pesto and marinara sauce. The whole burger contains more than the recommended daily allowance <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> for men at 2,520 calories, with 144grams of fat, 59g of which is saturated, and 3,780mg of sodium, {{more than double the}} recommended daily allowance for adults. However, according to Burger King's Vice President of global marketing, John Schaufelberger, the burger is not intended to feed just one person. Each slice has 420 calories, 24g fat (10g saturated), and 630mg sodium.|$|E
5|$|After initiation, {{the child}} {{regularly}} visits the hospital outpatient clinic where {{he or she}} is seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number <b>of</b> <b>calories,</b> altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).|$|E
5|$|Wilder's colleague, {{paediatrician}} Mynie Peterman, later formulated {{the classic}} diet, with {{a ratio of}} one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10–15g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> from fat. Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Barborka, also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least likely {{to benefit from the}} diet, {{and the use of the}} ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} {{nutrition}} demand pattern for rural households in India. The non-parametric approach of quantile regression {{is applied to}} characterize the entire distribution <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> consumption. This technique has an advantage over the traditional ordinary least square technique. It relaxes the assumption of a constant effect of the explanatory variables over the entire distribution of the dependent variable. These effects are allowed to vary over the entire distribution of dependent variable i. e., {{in this case the}} distribution <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> consumption. The results show that indeed, the responsiveness <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> consumption to various factors differs across different levels <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> consumption. A comparison of the quantile regression results with OLS results suggests conclusions and policy suggestions based on OLS results are unlikely to be ideal. Some further light is also shed on the debate on calorie income elasticity as the magnitude is observed to be different for the undernourished and the over nourished households. ...|$|R

30|$|We {{emphasize}} {{that it is}} not the use <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> value and nutrition value is inappropriate or unsophisticated; it is that the adoption <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> and nutrition measures may differentiate food commodities unnecessarily, and adds levels of complexity to the entire estimating process. For example, equivalent weight measures of fresh asparagus, frozen asparagus, cooked asparagus, and canned asparagus will have varying levels <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> and nutrition. It is possible to make the same argument for the different varieties of asparagus (white, green, purple, and wild). Furthermore, other researchers have argued that where and how the produce is grown (in fertile versus arid lands; using various cultivation practices), processed, transported, stored, and prepared will influence calorie and nutrition values.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{search for}} Calorie Restriction Mimetics (CRM) - {{compounds}} that mimic the genetic, biochemical and physical actions <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> restriction- {{is not a}} search for a ‘lazy dieters pill’. It is a quest aiming to clarify the basic mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> restriction and develop strategies in order to prevent, treat or alleviate age-related conditions. The development of CRM will add new and important assets in our armamentarium of anti-ageing therapies, with the ultimate result of increasing healthy human lifespan. This Special Supplement on CRM is an attempt to discuss some agents which may be used instead <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> restriction itself. Agents such as resveratrol, metformin, carnosine and Rimonabant are mainstream oral therapies already used by millions of people for other clinical indications. New CRM such as NADH, gugulipids and certain drugs that interfere with glucose metabolism can be also used as oral therapy. Less easily available CRM such as oxaloacetic acid, naloxone, leptin, adiponectin, rapamycin and sirtuins are further examples of promising agents. In order for the therapy to be effective, a combination of these must be used. This paper summarises the actions <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> restriction and then suggests several examples of possible CRM. Some of these examples can be used in everyday clinical setting...|$|R

25|$|Lomborg {{analyzes}} {{three major}} themes: life expectancy, food and hunger, and prosperity, finding that life expectancy and health levels have dramatically improved {{over the past}} centuries, even though several {{regions of the world}} remain threatened, in particular by AIDS. He dismisses Thomas Malthus' theory that increases in the world's population lead to widespread hunger. On the contrary, Lomborg claims that food is widespread, and humanity's daily intake <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> is increasing, and will continue to rise until hunger's eradication, thanks to technological improvements in agriculture. However, Lomborg notes that Africa in particular still produces too little sustenance, an effect he attributes to the continent's dismal economic and political systems. Concerning prosperity, Lomborg argues that wealth, as measured by per capita GDP, should not be the only judging criterion. He points to improvements in education, safety, leisure, and ever more widespread access to consumer goods as signs that prosperity is increasing {{in most parts of the}} world.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCalorie {{restriction}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} effective nutritional interventions that reproducibly protects against obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence suggests that even when implemented over a short period, calorie restriction is a safe and effective treatment for cardiovascular disease. Herein, we review the effects <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> restriction on the cardiovascular system as well as the biological effects of resveratrol, the most widely studied molecule that appears to mimic calorie restriction. An overview of microarray data reveals that the myocardial transcriptional effects <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> restriction overlap with the transcriptional responses to resveratrol treatment. In addition, calorie restriction and resveratrol modulate similar pathways to improve mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress and increase nitric oxide production that are involved in atherosclerosis prevention, blood pressure reduction, attenuation of left-ventricular hypertrophy, resistance to myocardial ischemic injury and heart failure prevention. We also review the data that suggest that the effects <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> restriction and resveratrol on the cardiovascular system may involve signaling through the silent information regulator of transcription (SIRT), Akt and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways. While accumulating data demonstrate the health benefits <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> restriction and resveratrol in experimental animal models, whether these interventions translate to patients with cardiovascular disease remains to be determined...|$|R

25|$|Another view is {{that until}} the Upper Paleolithic, humans were frugivores (fruit eaters) who {{supplemented}} their meals with carrion, eggs, and small prey such as baby birds and mussels, and only on rare occasions managed to kill and consume big game such as antelopes. This view is supported by studies of higher apes, particularly chimpanzees. Chimpanzees are the closest to humans genetically, sharing more than 96% of their DNA code with humans, and their digestive tract is functionally {{very similar to that}} of humans. Chimpanzees are primarily frugivores, but they could and would consume and digest animal flesh, given the opportunity. In general, their actual diet in the wild is about 95% plant-based, with the remaining 5% filled with insects, eggs, and baby animals. In some ecosystems, however, chimpanzees are predatory, forming parties to hunt monkeys. Some comparative studies of human and higher primate digestive tracts do suggest that humans have evolved to obtain greater amounts <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> from sources such as animal foods, allowing them to shrink the size of the gastrointestinal tract relative to body mass and to increase the brain mass instead.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 25 January 1995, {{the next}} {{instalment}} {{is devoted to}} the ways in which plants reproduce. Pollen and a stigma are the two components needed for fertilisation. Most plants carry both these within their flowers and rely on animals to transport the pollen from one to the stigma of another. To do this, they attract their couriers with colour, scent and nectar. It isn't just birds that help pollination: some mammals and reptiles also do so. However, it is mostly insects that are recruited to carry out the task. To ensure that pollen is not wasted by being delivered to the wrong flower, some species of plant have developed exclusive relationships with their visitors, and the gentian and its attendant carpenter bees is one example. Since pollen can be expensive to produce in terms <b>of</b> <b>calories,</b> some plants, such as orchids, ration it by means of pollinia and a strategically placed landing platform. Other orchids offer no reward for pollination, but instead mislead their guests by mimicking their markings and aroma, thus enticing males to 'mate' with them (Pseudocopulation). The most extreme fertilisation method is one of imprisonment, and one plant that uses it is the dead horse arum. It is often found near gull colonies, and mimics the appearance and smell of rotting flesh. Blow-flies are attracted to it, and are forced to stay the night before being allowed to depart in the morning, laden with pollen. Finally, Attenborough introduces the world's largest inflorescence: that of the titan arum.|$|E
