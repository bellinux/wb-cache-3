Brunt called him [...] "a , a van Gogh, a Picasso, a Charlie Parker". During the 1993-94 season, Bure demonstrated his strong playmaking abilities, helping linemate and friend Gino Odjick score a career-high 16 goals in a single season, more than twice the number of goals Odjick would score in any other year separated from Bure, and doubling his career goal totals up to that point in his career. According to teammate Cliff Ronning in 1994, [...] "we play a much sounder game defensively when Pavel's flying, as he was in the first period". Former Canuck teammate Jyrki Lumme spoke of Bure as a player and teammate, [...] "That guy does something spectacular every time ... it's frustrating to go against him in practice because he's all over the place.

500|$|On July 3, 2013, the Rockets omitted White's {{name from}} its Orlando Summer League roster, which was {{conspicuous}} according to Houston Chronicle writer Jonathan Feigen. Two days later, several news outlets confirmed that White {{and the rights}} to Furkan Aldemir had been traded to the Philadelphia 76ers for future considerations, which helped Houston clear $1.7 million of salary cap space to help sign Dwight Howard. As White waited for the trade to be approved, he played in a YMCA league. On July 13, the 76ers announced the deal officially. White participated in voluntary offseason workouts with the team and was expected to participate in training camp when it began on September 28. On September 27, at media day, White stated {{that he planned to}} travel with the team when necessary (even on its pre-season trip to Spain). However, White did not make the October 4 trip with the team to Spain. The press reported that 14 players traveled with the team and 5 did not. CBS Sports journalist Matt Moore gave three possible reasons for White's absence: 1.) goodwill effort by the team, 2.) a sign the team plans to waive him, 3.) a conditioning issue. Philadelphia Daily News reporter Bob Cooney tweeted, [...] "White, who suffers from anxiety disorder, planned to make the flight but team 'gave him a pass,' source told me." [...] According to 76ers coach Brett Brown, [...] "It really was just based <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>team</b> doctor giving me and [...] Sam [...] and the club advice that it may be best for him to remain at home." [...] The box score from {{the first game of the}} road trip indicates that 15 players traveled with the team and 5 did not. On October 25, 2013, White was waived by the 76ers as they cut their roster from 20 to 16 before the October 28 deadline to reach a 15-man roster. The move was described as surprising to various NBA analysts such as NJ.com's Eliot Shorr-Parks and Bleacher Report Joe Flynn. On October 24, USA Today had run an article suggesting that White was fairly certain to make the team. By mid-December, White was living in Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania with his wife and children aged 2.5 years and 6 months and had switched agents from Andrew Vye of ASM Sports to George Bass of AAI Sports.|$|E

Winds increased around 11  a.m., occasionally contributing to 50 – 70  dBA measured peak noise levels during gusts; typical background noise readings without gusts were around 35  dBA. The storm moved into the area around 2  pm, with rain and hail starting around 3 : 30  p.m., marking the practical end of fieldwork.
