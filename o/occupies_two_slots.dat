50|$|The Altix 350 was a {{mid-range}} {{model that}} supported up to 32 Itanium 2 processors. Introduced in 2005, it ran Linux, rather than SGI's own Unix variant, IRIX. The Altix 350 was scalable {{from one to}} thirty-two 64-bit Intel Itanium processors. It featured DDR SDRAM and PCI-X expansion ports, and could support SCSI or SATA internal hard drives. Designed as a rack-mount server, the Altix 350 was 2U, meaning it <b>occupied</b> <b>two</b> <b>slots</b> vertically in a standard server rack. The Altix 1350 was a cluster of Altix 350 systems.|$|R

40|$|A multi-code Code {{division}} {{multiple access}} (CDMA) slotted ALOHA system with a Sub-packet channel load sensing protocol (SCLSP) is proposed to support multi-rate data services. In the SCLSP, each packet <b>occupies</b> <b>two</b> time <b>slots,</b> the channel load of the next time slot can therefore be computed by using the previous channel information. The channel load is used as the access control criterion by users that have packets to transmit. The throughput performance of the proposed system is evaluated and {{compared with that of}} the system using the random access scheme. The SCLSP improves the system performance by greatly enlarging the range of traffic load where good throughput performance is provided. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Fermilab's new Recycler Ring {{will recover}} and cool "used" antiprotons {{at the end}} of a Tevatron store and also {{accumulate}} "new" antiprotons from the antiproton source. A wideband rf system based on barrier buckets will result in unbunched beam, grouped in one to three separate partitions throughout the ring. A new beam position monitor system will measure position of any one partition at a time, using low-frequency signals from beam distribution edges. A signal path including an elliptical split-plate detector, radiation-resistant tunnel preamplifiers, and logarithmic amplifiers, will result in a held output voltage nearly proportional to position. The results will be digitized using Industry Pack technology and a Motorola MVME 162 processor board. The data acquisition subsystem, including digitization and timing for 80 position channels, will <b>occupy</b> <b>two</b> VME <b>slots.</b> System design will be described, with some additional emphasis on the use of logamp chips.
