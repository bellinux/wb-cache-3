5|$|York {{were beaten}} 3–2 away by Leyton Orient, {{who took a}} two-goal lead through Mathieu Baudry and Jay Simpson before Oliver {{equalised}} in first-half stoppage time. Orient restored their two-goal advantage through Simpson in the second half, and Oliver scored a consolation goal with a header in the 86th minute. York were beaten 6–0 away by Portsmouth, in which Greening was sent off before half-time for catching Michael Doyle with his elbow, before Ben Davies and Marc McNulty gave the home team the lead {{early in the second}} half. McNulty scored two more goals before Ben Tollitt and Conor Chaplin finished the scoring for Portsmouth; this result saw York drop into the relegation zone {{for the first time in}} 2015–16. York signed five players before the deadline for loan transfers: defenders Mark Kitching from Middlesbrough and Stefan O'Connor from Arsenal, midfielders Jordan Lussey from Bolton Wanderers and Kenny McEvoy from Tottenham Hotspur, and striker Bradley Fewster from Middlesbrough. Winger Danny Galbraith, released by Gillingham at the end <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>season,</b> was signed before the deadline for free transfers. Collins, Morris, Turner and Tutonda were sent back to their parent clubs. York suffered another heavy defeat after losing 5–1 at home to Accrington, who were two goals up at half-time with goals from Matty Pearson and Billy Kee. Josh Windass scored a penalty for Accrington after O'Connor tripped Tom Davies, and Kee scored their fourth before Fewster scored for York with a shot into the bottom corner on 75 minutes. Shay McCartan finished the scoring for Accrington late into the match, and the result meant York equalled a club record of eight straight defeats.|$|E

The {{start of the}} season didn't go as smoothly as the end <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>season,</b> however. Through the first six races of the season, Johnson only managed to score one top ten finish. He rebounded with back to back wins at the 2017 O'Reilly Auto Parts 500 in Texas and the 2017 Food City 500 at Bristol. This would be the 14th time he has won back-to-back races in his career. Johnson then finished just outside the top ten at Richmond, even after colliding with his teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr earlier in the race. Johnson scored his third win of the season at Dover in June after beating Kyle Larson in an overtime finish.

"Towards the end <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>season,</b> where I {{said the}} best is yet to come, I {{strongly}} felt that way because towards the end <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>season</b> we closed out the season strong. I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, {{to get a little}} bit more out of everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high {{to get a little bit}} more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E
500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{revealed}} {{before the}} Charity Shield game {{that he was}} not overly concerned with Anelka leaving, rather the injuries that were depleting his squad: [...] "I cannot forget that it was because of a poor start to last season that we lost the championship to Manchester United." [...] He refused to categorise the match as a [...] "friendly" [...] much like it is traditionally viewed as: [...] "There is a trophy and medals at stake. We won it last season and our players want to win it again." [...] Ferguson described the 3–0 defeat in the previous season's Shield as a [...] "humiliation", before discussing how it made the team prepare for the challenges ahead: [...] "I have reminded the players {{how hard it is to}} lose when you are playing for United these days – it makes so many other people happy." [...] Indeed, United only lost five matches of the whole <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>season,</b> with their last defeat coming at home to Middlesbrough in December 1998.|$|E

[...] James Hunt, also for Den of Geek, gave a positive review as well, stating [...] "The momentum of last season's finale hasn't been lost, and indeed, it's even been added to. Last year I criticised the pilot episode for, above all else, failing to recreate {{the feel of the}} Marvel Cinematic Universe.

500|$|Arsenal began November with {{a trip to}} Elland Road to face Leeds United. There were {{no changes}} to the team from the Charlton game; for Leeds, Pennant started against his parent club after being granted {{permission}} by Wenger. Arsenal's victory by four goals to one was identical to the scoreline in the corresponding fixture <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>season.</b> In a match report for the News of the World, journalist Martin Samuel picked Henry as {{the man of the}} match and asserted Arsenal remained the team to beat. Attention soon turned to the North London derby, where Arsenal played Tottenham Hotspur on 8 November 2003. Tottenham had not beaten their rivals since November 1999 and their last win at Highbury had come a decade previously. Kanu was brought into the starting line-up to partner Henry, as Wiltord was ruled out with a calf strain. Arsenal conceded an early goal after Darren Anderton capitalised on a defensive mix-up, but they scored two late goals in what was described as [...] "another stuttering" [...] performance in The Observer. The result put Arsenal four points clear in first, albeit temporarily as Chelsea's win at home to Newcastle United 24 hours later cut their gap to one point.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{recorded}} {{their first}} win of the pre-season against Austria Wien. Bergkamp capped off a [...] "superb individual display" [...] by scoring the first goal {{and setting up}} the second for Jeffers. The final match of the tour was against Beşiktaş, which required tightened security given the history between English and Turkish football supporters. Bergkamp scored the only goal of the match in the second half, [...] "a cheeky effort through keeper Óscar Córdoba's legs". An Arsenal XI in England two days later faced St Albans City, where they won 3–1. The main squad then travelled to Scotland to play Celtic on 2 August 2003. Both goals in the one-all draw came in the second half; the match marked the return of Vieira after three months out with a knee problem. Wenger revealed afterwards {{that he intended to}} use the pre-season as an experiment for his defence. He partnered centre back Campbell with Touré, who for much <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>season</b> played in midfield. Wenger was pleased with Touré's performance against Celtic and said: [...] "He has quality. He was originally a central defender and, because we have kept a few clean sheets recently and he's played well, I thought we'd keep him there." [...] An Arsenal XI travelled to Belgium for a game against Beveren and conceded two goals in the final five minutes to draw the match 2–2. Arsenal rounded off their pre-season preparations with a 3–0 win against Rangers on 5 August 2003.|$|E

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} episode an 8.3 out of 10, praising the visual style, {{which he called}} [...] "less glossy" [...] than {{previous}} episodes, {{as well as the}} introduction of new characters and development of old ones, especially the introduction of Carl Creel and the [...] "nicely done FX showing off his power". He did note that the episode [...] "did little to actually give Hunter or Mack [...] " [...] and stated [...] "I don’t really buy that Fitz would even be there, working alongside the team, at this point. Doesn't he have friends or family he could be with?"

500|$|Bridges re-joined Conference National side Kettering Town on 1 August 2011, {{signing a}} two-year {{deal with the}} club. He joined Kettering on a free transfer, having been out of {{contract}} at Stevenage — [...] "I got injured at the back end <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>season</b> and I was out of contract and {{because of all the}} deals that needed to be sorted at Stevenage, I wasn't a priority and I had to wait. There comes a time when you can't wait any longer and I needed to sort my future out so here we are". Bridges made his Kettering Town debut in a 2–0 away win at Lincoln City on 10 September 2011, the club's first away victory of the season. After making just five appearances for Kettering, Bridges was transfer-listed by new manager Mark Stimson on 29 September. Despite being transfer-listed due to Kettering's financial problems, Bridges continued to play in the first-team, and he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–2 draw against Ebbsfleet United, scoring from close range to give the club an initial one-goal lead. Bridges scored once again in a 2–1 home defeat to Grimsby Town on 26 November 2011, scoring in injury-time to half the deficit. Bridges was forced to take training following the departure of Stimson, with only six other Kettering players turning up to train due to unpaid wages. Despite the off-field problems, he remained ever-present {{for the remainder of the}} season, playing 38 times in all competitions, and scoring his third and final goal of the campaign in a 1–1 home draw with Barrow in April 2012. Kettering were relegated, finishing bottom of the league, and faced a further relegation due to entering a Company Voluntary Arrangement. Bridges had one year remaining on his contract at Kettering, but left in July 2012, calling the campaign the [...] "worst of his career".|$|E

Rhimes {{disclosed that}} the main concept for the episode was to [...] "go in places the audience can imagine, but doesn't expect", {{in an attempt to}} [...] "freshen up" [...] the series for the new season. Rhimes stated that she originally planned to move the timeline three months after the conclusion of the second season, but the process did not occur, due to her not wanting the audience to miss significant moments from the character's complex lives. [...] "I feel like so much happened at the end <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>season</b> that I owe it to the characters to have them deal with the aftermath. And I owe it to the audience to let them watch the aftermath", stated Rhimes, in response to her decision to continue the storyline from where the previous season left off. Rhimes also described the prominence which Grey's underwear has in the first episode of the season, noting how they are [...] "a key element" [...] in the development of her character: [...] "Meredith never put them back on. She rushed out to deal with Izzie and left Derek who was asking what that meant, and she {{never had a chance to}} put those panties back on." [...] Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rhimes described it as achieving a balance between the aftermath of the recent events and the past experiences that define each character. In addition, she noted how the episode marked the transition to a new chapter in the personal backgrounds of the protagonists, stating: [...] "It was mean to bring us to a place where we can say goodbye to Denny, as well as deal with Meredith's love triangle. Just remember that nothing is ever wrapped up easily on this show. Because things aren't neat and clean in real life." ...|$|E

500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>season,</b> a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking. You know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys in the boys club and my character anyway, so when that happened it was sort of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh. OK, well, check this out." ...|$|E
