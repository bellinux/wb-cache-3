5|$|Nailsea Methodist Church {{was founded}} in 1789; the first {{building}} opened three years later. In 1914 a new chapel was opened on Silver Street, and a youth club was added in the 1960s. In early 1992 the old church was replaced with a larger, flexible, multi-purpose building and the youth club was refurbished and renamed the Wesley Centre after Methodism’s founder, John Wesley. There is also Nailsea Baptist Church, the Catholic Church <b>of</b> <b>St</b> <b>Francis</b> of Assisi, Southfield Church, the United Reformed Church and the Community Church.|$|E

5|$|Pakiam {{was born}} in Tapah, Perak, on the feast day of the popular saint of children, St. Nicholas. Educated at the Sultan Yusuf School in Batu Gajah, he entered the minor seminary in 1955 and started his priestly {{formation}} at the College General in Penang three years later. Pakiam was ordained a priest on 10 May 1964, and served as assistant priest at the Church of St. Louis, Taiping. The following year, he was posted to the Church <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Francis</b> Xavier in Penang and became the Parish Priest of the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes, Silibin, Ipoh from 1970–72.|$|E
5|$|The 1939 California {{tropical}} storm, {{also called}} the 1939 Long Beach tropical storm, El Cordonazo, The Lash <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Francis</b> was a tropical cyclone that hit Southern California in September, 1939. Formerly a hurricane, {{it was the only}} tropical storm to make landfall in California in the twentieth century. The only other known tropical cyclone to directly affect California is the 1858 San Diego hurricane, and only three other eastern Pacific tropical cyclones have caused gale-force winds in the continental United States. The tropical storm caused heavy flooding, leaving many dead, mostly at sea.|$|E
5|$|To Cairano, also, is {{attributed}} the Altar of San Girolamo {{in the church}} <b>of</b> <b>St</b> <b>Francis.</b> One of the critical issues of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia {{is the lack of}} historical sources on its origin. Certainly the altar was carved after 1506, given its high quality and artistic originality, indeed the highest level of art in the Brescian period, and evokes several features of Cairano's earlier work on the Loggia and front-yard of San Pietro's church in Oliveto.|$|E

5|$|Having gained {{prestige}} {{from the}} constructions in the Loggia, Cairano {{received at least}} two commissions from the nobility of Brescia. Involved in {{the leadership of the}} new administration, they were certainly aware of his ability. There are papers dating back to 1496 that document Cairano's commission for the Tomb of Gaspare Brunelli, which, in 1500, was placed in the Brunelli chapel within the Church <b>of</b> <b>St</b> <b>Francis.</b> During the same period, the Caprioli family commissioned the tomb of Luigi Caprioli to be placed within their chapel in the church of San Giorgio, probably together with other sculptures, made probably in collaboration with the Sanmicheli workshop, to which is attributed the marble jamb decorated with candelabras.|$|E
5|$|In Pennsylvania, the {{remnants}} of the storm dropped up to 8inches (200mm) of rain in Tannersville. The rainfall caused the Schuylkill River to reach a crest peak of 12.89ft (4 m) at Berne. The flooding blocked several roads across eastern Pennsylvania. In addition, Bonnie produced gusty winds, leaving thousands without power. In Delaware, the storm dropped up to 4inches (100mm) of rain, forcing 100 to evacuate from the floodwaters. The flooding closed part of U.S. Route 13, and an overflown creek in New Castle County caused moderate flooding damage to stores. In Maine, moisture from {{the remnants}} of Bonnie produced heavy rainfall, with localized totals of up to 10inches (250mm). The rainfall flooded or washed out roads across the eastern portion of the state. In Aroostook County, near the town <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Francis,</b> the rainfall caused a mudslide which narrowed a county road to one lane.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} side of the altar are two retablos. The larger altar on {{the right side}} {{currently}} houses the image <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Francis</b> Xavier as preacher on the topmost level. On the middle level of the same retablo are images of Saint Vincent Ferrer in the center, and Saint Augustine and Saint Monica on the left and right niches, respectively. The lowest level contains images of the Nuestra Señora de la Consolacion in the center, Saint Anne to the right and Saint Thérèse of Lisieux (originally St Joachim) on the left. The smaller altar has two levels of baroque and neoclassical style, respectively, with images of the crucified Christ on the lower level and the Holy Infant on the upper. The tomb of Father Aquilino Bon and other Recollect priests who served Loboc are also on this side of the church. The remains of Jesuit priest Alonso de Humanes were formerly interred in this area before the transfer of his remains to San Ignacio in Intramuros. An apocryphal account tells of a fire in a former Loboc church stopping at the foot of Humanes' tomb; this story spread across the people of the Loboc and nearby towns, which drew pilgrims to light candles in memory of Humanes.|$|E
