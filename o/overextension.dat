5|$|The {{limbs of}} the horse are {{structures}} made of dozens of bones, joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments that support {{the weight of the}} equine body. They include two apparatuses: the suspensory apparatus, which carries much of the weight, prevents <b>overextension</b> of the joint and absorbs shock, and the stay apparatus, which locks major joints in the limbs, allowing horses to remain standing while relaxed or asleep. The limbs play a major part in the movement {{of the horse}}, with the legs performing the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of the weight is borne by the front legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and shock absorption, and containing structures which provide blood flow through the lower leg. As the horse developed as a cursorial animal, with a primary defense mechanism of running over hard ground, its legs evolved to the long, sturdy, light-weight, one-toed form seen today.|$|E

5000|$|Like overgeneralizations, <b>overextensions</b> are {{believed}} to stem from limitations in vocabulary, which {{are the result of}} weak knowledge and/or immature retrieval ability. [...] Clark and Clark (1977) have put forth a two-stage account of how <b>overextensions</b> develop. In the first stage, a child focuses on a particular feature of an object and refers to that feature using a single new word. Gradually, the child realizes that the word has a more specific meaning but does not know the other words that are required to be more precise. In the second stage, the child overextends the word, using it as a form of shorthand when referring to things that are similar to the standard referent. For example, the child uses dog to refer to any animal with similar features, namely four legs.|$|R

40|$|Most current {{accounts}} of color word acquisition {{propose that the}} delay between children’s first production of color words and adult-like understanding is due to problems abstracting color as a domain of meaning. Here we present evidence against this hypothesis, and show that, from the time children produce color words in a labeling task they use them to represent color. In Experiment 1, an analysis of early color word errors finds that, before acquiring adult-like understanding, children make systematic hypotheses about color word meanings, which are best characterized as <b>overextensions</b> of adult meanings. Using a comprehension task, Experiment 2 finds that these <b>overextensions</b> are due to overly broad color categories, rather than a communicative strategy. These {{results indicate that the}} delay between production and adult-like understanding of color words is not due to difficulties abstracting color, but is largely attributable to the problem of determining the color boundaries marked by specific languages.

Two-word descriptions are syntactically generated and compete against one-word descriptions from the outset. Two-word descriptions become dominant as word combinations are repeatedly recognised, forming syntactic categories; resulting in an emergent simple syntax. The system demonstrates a similar maturation as children as evidenced by phenomena such as <b>overextensions</b> and mismatching, and the use of one-word descriptions being replaced by two-word descriptions over time. ...|$|R

However, children coin words to fill in for words not yet learned (for example, someone is a cooker rather than a chef because a child may not know what a chef is).

Hayes himself was deep in debt to Union Planters Bank, which administered loans for the Stax label {{and many of}} its other key employees. In September of that year, Hayes sued Stax for $5.3 million. As Stax was in deep debt and could not pay, the label made an arrangement with Hayes and Union Planters: Stax released Hayes from his recording and production contracts, and Union Planters would collect all of Hayes's income and apply it towards his debts. Hayes formed his own label, Hot Buttered Soul, which released its product through ABC Records.|$|E

In a name applicability task, seven- to 13 -year old Dutch-speaking children judged whether each of three names applied to common household containers. In a typicality judgment task, participants judged how good an example the containers were of the three names. Both tasks revealed continued evolution of word use up to age 13. However, all names were overextended by the children, in contrast to the production data in which both over- and underextension were found. Moreover, the child lexical categories showed considerable overlap, indicating strong inter-category relatedness. With age these <b>overextensions</b> as well as the overlap gradually disappeared and the lexical categories became more distinct over time...|$|R
25|$|<b>Overextension</b> {{reduced the}} {{capabilities}} of the German Army and its allies to defend this territory and the Soviets mounted a decisive offensive at Stalingrad, encircling a German army. Soon both sides concentrated on the battle for the city, making Caucasus a secondary theatre. With Army Group B unable to hold the Volga line, Soviet offensives almost cut off Army Group A in Caucasus and it was forced to withdraw. The surrender of Sixth Army was a huge blow to German morale and it came as a great shock to Hitler. Despite the destruction of Sixth Army, the Soviets were only able to force the German Army back from Caucasus, delaying the final decision on the Eastern Front. The Soviet command overestimated its capabilities and pushed its forces forward to the limit of its supply lines, which led to defeat at the Third Battle of Kharkov and left the Germans able to fight the Battle of Kursk in the summer of 1943.|$|E
25|$|For a poorly-resourced mission, {{the cost}} of {{maintaining}} the steamer required a strong focus on local provisioning. With a draught permitting access to {{all areas of the}} lake, the ship itself was largely self-sustaining, her steam engine powered by wood scavenged from the shore areas. But the matter of slave raiding was more problematic, requiring not only manpower for site security, but also an appreciation of the uneasy boundaries that lay between the worlds of evangelism, medicine and trade. Finding appropriately qualified crew prepared to accept low pay and the tribulations of life on the lake was one thing; the Mission’s unyielding insistence on celibacy among its European staff was an even greater recruitment challenge. Behind all this lay the tensions arising from the Mission’s intentional policy of <b>overextension</b> of its mission surrounding Lake Nyasa. The Chauncy Maples operated in the contradictory world of an evangelical mission which offered desperately needed medical support to the poor in an environment of political instability and unfettered imperial capitalism.|$|E
25|$|With Germany and Italy {{providing}} the buffer with France, the Austrian Habsburgs had maintained what {{was crucial to}} their security and interests. Together with the recent Balkan conquests, Charles VI now ruled an extensive Habsburg empire. Austria had confirmed its position as a major power, yet the Habsburg dynasty had fallen short of its full war aims: Spain had been lost to Philip V and Sicily lost to the Duke of Savoy. Although Sardinia was exchanged for Sicily in 1720 the island, together with the acquisitions of the Spanish Netherlands and Naples, extended the Monarchy's responsibilities beyond their traditional interests and commitments – an <b>overextension</b> which made the Habsburg territories more vulnerable at their periphery, particularly without {{the assistance of the}} Maritime Powers. In Germany, the Imperial army had been unable to recover the lost lands in Alsace and Lorraine, and the Holy Roman Empire itself made no gains, and even lost territory (Landau). This was largely {{due to the fact that}} Vienna's principal concern had been to establish a secure Danubian state, and the Emperor and his ministers had been unwilling to put German interests before those of Italy and Hungary. The Habsburgs would make further gains when Prince Eugene once again defeated the Ottomans in the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18, but Vienna's influence within the Empire declined, not least because the rulers of Hanover, Saxony, and Prussia had territorial claims beyond Germany, and now had royal titles which they considered equal to the Emperor.|$|E
40|$|Children’s <b>overextensions</b> {{of spatial}} {{language}} are often taken to reveal spatial biases. However, {{it is unclear}} whether extension patterns should be attributed to children’s overly general spatial concepts or to a narrower notion of conceptual similarity allowing metaphor-like extensions. We describe a previously unnoticed extension of spatial expressions and use a novel method to deter-mine its origins. English- and Greek-speaking 4 - and 5 -year-olds used containment expressions (e. g., English into, Greek mesa) for events where an object moved into another object but extended such expressions to events where the object moved behind or under another object. The pattern emerged in adult speakers of both languages and also in speakers of 10 additional lan-guages. We conclude that learners do not have an overly general concept of Containment. Never-theless, children (and adults) perceive similarities across Containment and other types of spatial scenes, even when these similarities are obscured by the conventional forms of the language...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{reflection}} on the category of popular toponym and on the pathways which they are subjected to. It operates in two directions: {{the first one is}} that of onomaturgy, the second one takes into account <b>overextensions,</b> secondary connotations and people's consciousness of places. The first issue moves from the reflections resulted from the collection of ethnic nicknames (or blasons pupulaires) in Sicily. In particular, we start from the observation according to which popular anthroponyms can contribute to generate in speakers popular toponyms that follow a pathway of overlapping/substitution like the one concerning ethnics and blasons populaires. The second issue regards official toponyms related to locations that have been charged with connotations in popular consciousness, becoming symbols or passing from proper nouns to common nouns on the basis of true or presumed peculiarities. It is the case of "Carrapipi" (today "Valguarnera Caropepe" in province of Enna), that indicates any place whose localization is difficult to identify, or that of Milocca (today "Milena" in province of Caltanissetta), which has become any remote place par excellence...|$|R
500|$|Children {{use words}} {{differently}} for objects, spatial relations and actions. Children ages {{one to three}} often rely on general purpose deictic words such as [...] "here", [...] "that" [...] or [...] "look" [...] accompanied by a gesture, which is most often pointing, to pick out specific objects. Children also stretch already known or partly known words to cover other objects that appear similar to the original. This can result in word <b>overextension</b> or misuses of words. Word <b>overextension</b> is governed by the perceptual similarities children notice among the different referents. Misuses of words indirectly provide ways of finding out which meanings children have attached to particular words. When children {{come into contact with}} spatial relations, they talk about the location of one object with respect to another. They name the object located and use a deictic term, such as here or [...] "there" [...] for location, or they name both the object located and its location. They can also use a general purpose locative marker, which is a preposition, postposition or suffix depending on the language that is linked in some way to the word for location. Children's earliest words for actions usually encode both the action and its result. Children use a small number of general purpose verbs, such as [...] "do" [...] and [...] "make" [...] for a large variety of actions because their resources are limited. Children acquiring a second language seem to use the same production strategies for talking about actions. Sometimes children use a highly specific verb instead of a general purpose verb. In both cases children stretch their resources to communicate what they want to say.|$|E

His strategy is said to have been [...] "inherently unpopular", but Pericles managed to persuade the Athenian public to follow it. It is for that reason that Hans Delbrück called him one of the greatest statesmen and military leaders in history. Although his countrymen engaged in several aggressive actions soon after his death, Platias and Koliopoulos argue that the Athenians remained true to the larger Periclean strategy of seeking to preserve, not expand, the empire, and did not depart from it until the Sicilian Expedition.

This approach seeks to move beyond ontological definitions based on categorical criteria toward a more phenomenological definition that can help us better understand the lived experience of diasporic subjects and the formation of diasporic communities. While these groups do not exist as entities that have some common essence or nature, I insist that they do exist phenomonologically. Rather than an objective, prescriptive definition of diaspora, this essay explores the subjective, descriptive quality of diaspora when approached from the inside, as an experience. A phenomenological approach, therefore, can rescue the term diaspora from its <b>overextensions</b> and case-specific limitations. A key consideration will be the role of memory in creating the phenomenon of diaspora. Diaspora must be understood as a phenomenon that emerges when displaced subjects who experience the loss of an "origin" (whether literal or symbolic) perpetuate identifications associated with those places of origin in subsequent generations through the mechanisms of postmemory...|$|R
40|$|Closeness is {{an elusive}} concept that is {{nevertheless}} {{central to the}} thinking of many psychotherapists about the process and goals of their work. Closeness is actually a metaphor that names something otherwise lacking a name. The author proposes that the behavioral correlate of an experience of closeness {{is an act of}} sharing. Managing closeness in psychotherapy therefore amounts to a series of decisions about what will be shared. An important characteristic of sharing is that it tends to be progressive, a source of its therapeutic power and its dangerousness. The implications of these ideas are examined, with particular attention to the problem of sexual abuse and those isolated individuals (both patients and therapists) who are more in need of therapeutic closeness and more vulnerable to its <b>overextensions.</b> I had a talk with Matthew [age 4] about your presentation on closeness in the treatment relationship.

40|$|Abstract—We {{address the}} {{fundamental}} problem of matching in two static images. The remaining challenges are related to occlusion and lack of texture. Our approach addresses these difficulties within a perceptual organization framework, considering both binocular and monocular cues. Initially, matching candidates for all pixels are generated {{by a combination of}} matching techniques. The matching candidates are then embedded in disparity space, where perceptual organization takes place in 3 D neighborhoods and, thus, does not suffer from problems associated with scanline or image neighborhoods. The assumption is that correct matches produce salient, coherent surfaces, while wrong ones do not. Matching candidates that are consistent with the surfaces are kept and grouped into smooth layers. Thus, we achieve surface segmentation based on geometric and not photometric properties. Surface <b>overextensions,</b> which are due to occlusion, can be corrected by removing matches whose projections are not consistent in color with their neighbors of the same surface in both images. Finally, the projections of the refined surfaces on both images are used to obtain disparity hypotheses for unmatched pixels. The final disparities are selected after a second tensor voting stage, during which information is propagated from more reliable pixels to less reliable ones. We present results on widely used benchmark stereo pairs. Index Terms—Stereo, occlusion, pixel correspondence, computer vision, perceptual organization, tensor voting. ...|$|R

The main forces of the 311th remained west of Volkhov, attached to 54th Army. On November 26 that army's main shock group (3rd Guards, 310th and 311st Rifle Divisions, plus 6th Naval Infantry Brigade) attacked the I Army Corps' 21st Infantry Division south of Volkhov, driving it back several kilometres south of the town by the 29th. Several days later, 54th Army was reinforced, and a new shock group, which included the 311th, attacked on December 3, successively encircling and destroying several companies of the 254th Infantry Division.

40|$|The present {{work is a}} {{plea for}} a cognitive-based view of lexical meaning. Traditional, usually taxonomically based {{descriptions}} such as trees or feature bundles are rather reductive and abstract and often cannot thoroughly represent reality. They lack a psychological foundation. This has been criticized repeatedly as a serious flaw in recent years. This article investigates how the meaning of words might be represented in a neurobiologically plausible way. To this end, the development of early word acquisition is described with several recurring phenomena, such as early underextensions, later <b>overextensions,</b> the interplay of linguistic and non-linguistic aspects and variable word-referent-mappings. The data are then explained {{in the light of}} network processing. In such an approach, the development of a category is seen to be influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Lexical acquisition means building a pattern of nodes and connections that represents a cognitive concept, building a pattern that represents a linguistic form and connecting these patterns. This might happen in parallel. The framework offers the possibility of integrating structuralistic feature analysis with psychologically based prototype theory and cognitive grammar. It enables us to understand the gradedness of the relevance of examples and exceptions, the possibility of change, context-dependent categorization, shifts of the decisive features, family resemblances and the relevance of the lexical field. It shows that these are crucial aspects of linguistic organization. Finally, some consequences for our conception of universals are sketched. A universal conceptual foundation is the consequence of many factors and no given precondition. ...|$|R

In Word and object, Quine {{raises the question}} how a linguist might acquire a language of a foreign tribe [0], p. 29. He points out that if a native says "Gavagai", while pointing to a rabbit scurrying by, it {{is in no way}} possible to uniquely determine its meaning. "Gavagai" could mean `rabbit', `animal', `white', as well as hundreds of other things. So, how can one ever acquire the meaning of a word? As pointed out by Eve Clarck [0], children have a very similar problem and it is therefore not surprising that <b>overextensions</b> or underextensions are observed in the first words. In computer simulations so far, most researchers have assumed that agents have direct access to each other's meanings, so that the problem of lexicon construction and acquisition becomes one of learning associations between words and meanings, with direct feedback on whether the right association has been learned. But in more realistic circumstances, humans as well as autonomous agents only get feedback on the communicative success of an interaction, not on what meanings were used. Even communicative success may not be completely clear although this additional source of uncertainty has not been explored further in our experiments. The problem of lexicon construction and acquisition must therefore be reformulated: The agents must acquire word-meaning and meaning-object relations which are compatible with the word-object co-occurrences they overtly observe but without observing word-meaning relations directly.

Here, non-literal language refers to any sequence (single words, word sequences, expressions, etc) which has a contextual meaning different from its semantic meaning. Two groups of thirty students majoring in French literature and Communication Studies were asked to write essays as part of an English course. The students were separated according to their proficiency in English. They showed either a B 1 or a B 2 level in English (cf. the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). Six types of non-literal sequences building up the learners' non-literal performance were identified -namely <b>overextensions,</b> L 1 transfers, personifications, comparisons, idioms and metaphors. Later in the semester, the same participants had to rewrite these essays in their mother tongue, French, for the purpose of cross-linguistic comparisons. Since we know that language learners tend to cling to literalness - up to giving an "unnatural over-literalness" aspect to their speech in the L 2 (Danesi, 1992) - the purpose of these essays was to get a element of comparison. We were then able to contrast the use of figurative language by the learners in their L 1 and in their L 2. As anyone could expect, the results revealed that we do not treat non-literalness the same way depending the language that we are using (a native vs. a foreign language). Interestingly, we found that what might explain these differences is the way language itself is perceived depending on whether people use their L 1 or their L 2...|$|R
