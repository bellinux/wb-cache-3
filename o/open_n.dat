40|$|Background. Splenectomy is {{performed}} frequently for various and primarily hematologic indications {{in children and}} adolescents. We analyzed the long-term outcome after splenectomy (median, 8. 7 years) focusing on sepsis, portal vein thrombosis (PVT), and retained accessory spleen. Methods. In total, 141 consecutive children after <b>open</b> (<b>n</b> = 89; 63 %) or laparoscopic (n = 52; 37 %) splenectomy from 1991 to 2010 were followed up through nationwide registries for septic infections, PVT, and causes of death. Sixty-six patients (58 % of survivors) answered a structured questionnaire on infections, abdominal symptoms, and general health, and 64 (laparoscopic n = 26, <b>open</b> <b>n</b> = 38) consented to ultrasonography of the portal venous system. Results. Median operation age was 8. 8 years (range, 1. 0 - 22). Reoperations were required for bleeding after open procedures (n = 1) and retained accessory spleen after laparoscopic procedures (n = 3). Postsplenectomy sepsis occurred after a median of 1. 7 years (range, 0. 2 - 5. 9) in 11 patients (8 %), of whom 10 had an underlying immunodeficiency. No cases of PVT were observed, although the median portal vein flow was 1, 130 mL/min (range, 440 - 2200) and diameter was 9. 9 mm (range, 7 - 15) at a median follow-up of 9. 5 years (range, 2. 0 - 22) after splenectomy. Twenty-seven patients (19 %) died after 8. 7 years (0. 03 - 23. 00). The {{most common cause of}} death was the underlying malignancy (n = 15), with sepsis being an additional cause of death in 5 patients. Conclusion. Postsplenectomy sepsis was associated almost exclusively with an underlying immunodeficiency with a high mortality rate. No PVT was observed. The overall risk of retained accessory spleen was around 7 %, and was slightly greater after laparoscopic operation,...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the morbidity and cost that are associated with laparoscopic and open Burch retropubic urethropexy when they are performed with concurrent vaginal prolapse repairs. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective study of all patients who had undergone laparoscopic (n = 76) or <b>open</b> (<b>n</b> = 143) Burch retropubic urethropexy with at least 1 concurrent vaginal repair for symptomatic prolapse. We compared demographic data, level of prolapse, operative and postoperative details, medical and surgical histories, complications, and hospital charges. RESULTS: The group with open retropubic urethropexy had an older age, greater degree of prolapse, fewer concurrent hysterectomies, and a greater number of vaginal procedures than the group with laparoscopic retropubic urethropexy. There were minimal differences in complications and no differences in the estimated blood loss, operative time, hemoglobin change, hospitalization, or hospital charges between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Traditional benefits of laparoscopic retropubic urethropexy were not apparent when vaginal prolapse repairs were performed...|$|E
40|$|Persistent trojectories of an n-dimensional system  are studied {{under the}} {{assumptions}} {{that the system}} is competitive and dissipativewith irreducible community matrices. The main result is that there is acanonically defined countable (generically finite) family of disjoint invariant <b>open</b> (<b>n</b> - 1) -cells which attract all non-convergent persistenttrajectories. These cells are Lipschiiz submanifolds and are transverseto positive rays. In dimension 3 this implies that an omega-limit set of a persistent orbit is either an equilibrium, a cycle bounding an invariant disc, or a one-dimensional continuum having a non-trivial first Cech cohomology group and containing an equilibrium. Thus the existence of a persistenttrajectory in the three-dimensional case implies the existence of a positive equilibrium. In any dimension it is shown that if the community matrices are strictly negative then there is a closed invariant (n - 1) cell which attracts every persistent trajectory. This shows that a seemingly special construction by Smale of certain competitive systems is in fact close to the general case...|$|E
