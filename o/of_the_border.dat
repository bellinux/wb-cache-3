5|$|The 1947 Sun Bowl {{game was}} held as the {{culminating}} {{event of the}} Sun Carnival and was held at 15,000-seat Kidd Field {{on the campus of}} Texas Western University, today known as the University of Texas El Paso. The matchup of Virginia Tech and Cincinnati was out of character for the Sun Bowl, which traditionally matched the champion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Border</b> Conference with the best possible opponent. Hardin-Simmons University, champions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Border</b> Conference, declined a Sun Bowl bid, as did the second-place team, Texas Tech. With no other option, a member of the Sun Bowl Committee—who happened to be an alumnus of Virginia Tech—suggested inviting the Hokies to play against Cincinnati, which had already accepted an invitation.|$|E

5|$|The closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> {{region for}} nearly 40years created {{a haven for}} {{wildlife}} in some places. Although parts of the East German side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> were farmed, intensive farming of the kind practised elsewhere in Germany was absent and large areas were untouched by agriculture. Conservationists became aware {{as early as the}} 1970s that the border had become a refuge for rare species of animals and plants. Their findings led the Bavarian government to begin a programme of buying land along the border to ensure its protection from development.|$|E
5|$|The {{two sides}} commemorated their dead in very {{different}} ways. Various mostly unofficial memorials were {{set up on the}} western side by people seeking to commemorate victims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> West Germans such as Michael Gartenschläger and Kurt Lichtenstein were commemorated with signs and memorials, some of which were supported by the government. The death of East German Heinz-Josef Große in 1982 was commemorated annually by demonstrations on the Western side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> After the policy of détente was initiated in the 1970s, this became politically inconvenient and state support for border memorials largely ceased.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} was a border war in 1277–78. It was reported {{mainly in the}} Yuan dynasty chronicle and the travelogue of Marco Polo.

5|$|According to Luttwak, {{the forward}} defence system was always {{vulnerable}} to unusually large barbarian concentrations of forces, as the Roman army was too thinly spread along the enormous borders {{to deal with}} such threats. In addition, the lack of any reserves to the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> entailed that a barbarian force that successfully penetrated the perimeter defences would have unchallenged ability to rampage deep into the empire before Roman reinforcements from other border garrisons could arrive to intercept them.|$|E

5|$|Before 1952, {{the inner}} German border could be crossed {{at almost any}} point along its length. The {{fortification}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> resulted in the severing of 32railway lines, three autobahns, 31main roads, eight primary roads, about 60 secondary roads and thousands of lanes and cart tracks. The number of crossing points was reduced to three air corridors, three road corridors, two railway lines and two river connections giving transit access to Berlin, plus a handful of additional crossing points for freight traffic.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Turkish War (1683–1698), Slavonia was regained but western Bosnia, {{which had}} been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest, {{remained}} outside Croatian control.

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Second World War, the East German side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> was guarded {{initially}} by the Border Troops (Pogranichnyie Voiska) of the Soviet NKVD (later the KGB). They were supplemented from 1946 by {{a locally}} recruited paramilitary force, the German Border Police (Deutsche Grenzpolizei or DGP), before the Soviets handed over full control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> to the East Germans in 1955/56. In 1961, the DGP was converted into a military force within the National People's Army (Nationale Volksarmee, NVA). The newly renamed Border Troops of the GDR (Grenztruppen der DDR, commonly nicknamed the Grenzer) came under the NVA's Border Command or Grenzkommando. They were responsible for securing and defending the borders with West Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Baltic Sea and West Berlin. At their peak, the Grenztruppen had up to 50,000personnel.|$|E
