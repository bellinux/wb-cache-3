5|$|Cancellor {{was found}} dead in his bedroom on the morning of 22 April. His body was covered, with long {{stockings}} over his legs and kidskin gloves on his hands. The only visible part of the body was his face. A medical man of Hopley's acquaintance named Roberts pronounced that the boy had died of natural causes. When questioned, Hopley suggested that Cancellor died <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> argued that he should be buried immediately. He wrote to the boy's father requesting the body's immediate removal and interment. After viewing his son's dressed body, Cancellor's father accepted Roberts' assertion for cause of death and agreed to the burial.|$|E

25|$|Other {{studies have}} shown that a high resting heart rate is {{associated}} with an increase in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the general population and in patients with chronic disease. A faster resting heart rate is associated with shorter life expectancy and is considered a strong risk factor for heart disease and heart failure, independent of level of physical fitness. Specifically, a resting heart rate above 65 beats per minute has been shown to have a strong independent effect on premature mortality; every 10 beats per minute increase in resting heart rate {{has been shown to be}} associated with a 10–20% increase in risk of death. In one study, men with no evidence <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> a resting heart rate of more than 90 beats per minute had a five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death. Similarly, another study found that men with resting heart rates of over 90 beats per minute had an almost two-fold increase in risk for cardiovascular disease mortality; in women it was associated with a three-fold increase.|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveIn {{patients}} with severe pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> {{we prefer to}} perform repair <b>of</b> the congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> lung transplantation whenever feasible so as to augment the donor pool and avoid the cardiac complications associated with heart transplantation. We report our experience with repair <b>of</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> lung transplantation and compare the results with those of patients who underwent heart-lung transplantation during the same period. MethodsThe records of patients who had repair <b>of</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> lung transplantation (n = 35) and heart-lung transplantation (n = 16) between 1990 and 2003 were reviewed. ResultsThe underlying congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in the repair <b>of</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> lung transplantation group included transposition of great vessels (n = 2), atrioventricular canal defect (n = 2), ventricular septal defect (n = 9), pulmonary venous obstruction (n = 7), scimitar syndrome (n = 2), pulmonary arterial atresia or stenosis (n = 5), and others (n = 8). Thirteen of the patients undergoing repair <b>of</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> lung transplantation (37. 1 %) had the congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> repaired before lung transplantation; the remaining congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> repairs were performed concurrently with transplantation. Sixteen patients underwent heart-lung transplantation because of poor left ventricular function or single-ventricle anatomy. Freedoms from bronchiolitis obliterans at 1, 3, and 5 years were 72. 9 %, 54. 7 %, and 54. 7 % for the repair <b>of</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> lung transplantation group and 77. 8 %, 51. 9 %, and 38. 9 % for the heart-lung transplantation group, respectively. Survivals at 1, 3, and 5 years were 62. 9 %, 51. 4 %, and 51. 4 % for the repair <b>of</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> lung transplantation group and 66. 5 %, 66. 5 %, and 60 % for the heart-lung transplantation group, respectively. ConclusionRepair <b>of</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> lung transplantation is a feasible treatment option. Long-term outcome is determined by associated complications related to lung transplantation. Despite the complexity <b>of</b> combined congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> repair with lung transplantation and the resulting perioperative morbidity, the patients had similar outcomes to those of patients who underwent heart-lung transplantation...|$|R

500|$|Following the {{completion}} of Long Day's Journey Into Night, Hepburn took a break in her career to care for ailing Spencer Tracy. She did not work again until 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, her ninth film with Tracy. The movie dealt with the subject of interracial marriage, with Hepburn's niece, Katharine Houghton, playing her daughter. Tracy was dying by this point, suffering the effects <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> <b>and</b> Houghton later commented that her aunt was [...] "extremely tense" [...] during the production. Tracy died 17 days after filming his last scene. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner was a triumphant return for Hepburn and her most commercially successful picture to that point. She won her second Best Actress Award at the Oscars, 34 years after winning her first. Hepburn felt the award was not just for her, but was also given to honor Tracy.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, a CIAR-funded {{study on}} secondhand smoke {{exposure}} by Peter Lee was published. The tobacco industry {{hoped that the}} study would undermine the validity of a 1981 study by Takeshi Hirayama, which reported a positive association between secondhand smoke and lung cancer risk. The final paper concluded that studies like Hirayama's were subject to misclassification bias, and therefore, had [...] "little scientific basis". In 1995, the journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology published two studies funded by the CIAR examining the association between ETS and heart disease. Both studies concluded that ETS exposure from spouses did not increase the risk <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> <b>and</b> that previous conclusions to the contrary were due to publication bias. Both of these studies {{have been criticized for}} suffering from exposure misclassification, because both studies failed to distinguish between current and former smokers. In 2003, a study funded by the center was published in the BMJ. Authored by James Enstrom and Geoffrey Kabat, the study found little association between secondhand smoke and coronary heart disease or lung cancer. This study has been criticized for failing to distinguish between those who were exposed to second-hand smoke and those who were not, because, according to the American Cancer Society, the study's participants were enrolled in 1959, [...] "when exposure to secondhand smoke was so pervasive that virtually everyone was exposed to ETS, {{whether or not they were}} married to a smoker." ...|$|E

500|$|Birkett {{had been}} offered {{appointment}} to the High Court as early as 1928, but turned it down, saying that [...] "I wasn't really drawn to the judicial office... I loved the Bar too much". After {{the death of the}} High Court judge Sir Anthony Hawke in October 1941, the Lord Chancellor Lord Simon offered Birkett the seat. Birkett considered it his [...] "public duty" [...] to join the bench and wrote back on 4 November accepting the offer. He was sworn in on 11 November 1941 and first sat on 24 November. He did not enjoy his time in the high courts, admitting that he [...] "missed the limelight" [...] of being an advocate, and, combined with ill-health, he suffered from depression in 1942. He was, however, a popular judge, although he felt he was too weak in his judgments because he [...] "did not desire to hurt people's feelings". At one point, the Daily Herald reported he was to be made Viceroy of India. For several weeks in 1943, he sat in the Court of Appeal before departing on an Assize visit. He fell ill after a few weeks with a combination <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> pneumonia, and he returned home to recover.
