500|$|Media {{portrayals of}} Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen {{relationships}} were varied and conflicting. Watts {{said of the}} filming of the scene, [...] "I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had {{tears in my eyes}} because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit." [...] However, in another interview Watts stated, [...] "I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [...] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, {{from the bottom of my}} heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [...] <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians." [...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 15 April 1959, Castro {{began an}} 11-day {{visit to the}} United States, at the {{invitation}} of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. He said during his visit: [...] "I know the world thinks of us, we are Communists, and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> said very clear that we are not Communists; very clear." ...|$|E

2500|$|Darwish {{is widely}} {{perceived}} as a Palestinian symbol and a spokesman for Arab opposition to Israel. He rejected accusations of antisemitism: [...] "The accusation is that I hate Jews. It's not comfortable that they show me as a devil and an enemy of Israel. I am not a lover of Israel, <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no reason to be. But I don't hate Jews." [...] Darwish wrote in Arabic, and also spoke English, French, and Hebrew.|$|E
2500|$|According to John Richardson in a 2007 Vanity Fair article, [...] "Jason Epstein's {{assessment}} of Silvers as 'The most brilliant {{editor of a}} magazine ever to have worked in this country' has been 'shared by virtually {{all of us who}} have been published by Robert Silvers'". The British newspaper [...] The Guardian called Silvers [...] "the greatest literary editor there has ever been", while Library of America remembered him as [...] "an unsurpassed editor who helped define and sustain the literary and intellectual culture of New York and America". The New York Times described him as [...] "the voracious polymath, the obsessive perfectionist, the slightly unknowable bachelor-workaholic with the colossal Rolodexes and faintly British diction", and, in his obituary, stated that [...] "under his editorship [...] became one of the premier intellectual journals in the United States, a showcase for extended, thoughtful essays on literature and politics by eminent writers." [...] Author Louis Begley wrote, [...] "the ideal editor of my – and I would guess every writer’s – dreams is ... Robert B. Silvers, the editor, brain, and heart of the NYRB. When I write a piece for his magazine, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the immeasurable good luck to be edited by him. [...] There is no experience quite like it. Bob knows everything that's worth knowing, a consequence of his unflagging curiosity." [...] "Bob's edits are scrupulous, comprehensive, and precise. They are frequently aimed at saving the reviewer's face." [...] Roger Cohen wrote, after Silvers' death, [...] "No eye for imprecise thought was ever more discerning; no edit a sharper yet gentler distillation than his. ... He was a stickler for accuracy. The pencil in his hand went {{to the heart of the}} matter." ...|$|E

6000|$|Had <b>I</b> heard it? <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard it. Who {{was there}} in all the Down country who had not heard of the Walker of Cliffe Royal? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No;--certainly not. I can {{beg your}} pardon, Lady Fawn, but not his. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{no right to}} talk about speeches, and politics, and this prince in your drawing-room." ...|$|R
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "We were {{laughing}}, <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been {{laughing at}} my friend's predicament, in being left {{to meet a}} lady he'd never seen before. You laughed at it yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. JONES. Your Worship, it's the {{children}} that's preying on his mind, because <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ve</b> lost my work. And I've {{had to find}} another room owing to the scandal.|$|R
6000|$|... "A psychic--undeveloped, <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> thought once or twice. Only {{a little}} while ago I was {{speaking}} to that man Chaffery about her." ...|$|E

60|$|All that day--in {{fact from}} the moment of his creation--Van Sweller had {{conducted}} himself fairly well in my eyes. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> had to make many concessions; but in return he had been no less considerate. Once or twice we had had sharp, brief contentions over certain points of behavior; but, prevailingly, give and take had been our rule.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{went there}} to hand over a captive who <b>had</b> been ransomed. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a safe conduct, and I was glad indeed of the {{opportunity}} of seeing so famous a fortress." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard <b>of</b> them--Lancelot, Galahad and {{all that}} lot, but I didn't see where the {{resemblance}} came in. It {{seemed to me that}} she must be thinking of a couple of other fellows.|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not. Indeed, <b>I</b> {{was hardly}} in {{condition}} {{to do any}} rational thinking, much less form an opinion. The thief might be in hiding close at hand, or he might be miles away.|$|R

6000|$|... "That," [...] said Ashe, [...] "would {{take too}} long to explain. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to do some tense {{inductive}} reasoning; but I cannot trace every link in the chain for you. It would be tedious." ...|$|R
