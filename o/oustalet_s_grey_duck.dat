40|$|Hybridisation is {{increasingly}} acknowledged as a conservation problem. The widespread hybridisation between <b>grey</b> <b>duck</b> (Anas superciliosa) and mallard (A. platyrhynchos) in New Zealand {{is a good}} example of a native species hybridising with a foreign one, and forms the main focus of this thesis. Mallards were introduced into New Zealand from Europe, and hybrids were soon observed. I surveyed the extent of the hybridisation on the West Coast of the South Island and found that, based on phenotype, at least half of population is now hybrids. Mallards and mallard-like hybrids dominate in the eastern South Island, while <b>grey</b> <b>ducks</b> occur only in some areas of the West Coast. Comparison with historical data suggests that the decline of the <b>grey</b> <b>duck</b> and the spread of hybrids has not stabilised and is ongoing. Contrary to expectations most <b>grey</b> <b>ducks</b> were found on agricultural land and most mallards on natural lakes or rivers, so <b>grey</b> <b>ducks</b> probably do not have an advantage over mallards on the less developed West Coast. An alternative theory is proposed here that explains the spatial distribution of hybridisation as a reflection of a temporal pattern. As mallards were first released in the east, the delay taken to cross the Southern Alps could also explain the pattern observed. This hypothesis suggests that the <b>grey</b> <b>duck</b> will persist in the southern West Coast. An analysis of the phenotypes of partners in pairs suggests that mating is positively assortative within each species and within hybrids. In fact, not a single pair of pure <b>grey</b> <b>duck</b> mated with pure mallard was observed in almost a thousand pairs, raising the question of how hybridisation started. There was a tendency for males to be more mallard-like in phenotype than their partners, suggesting there might be a selective advantage to the mallard male phenotype. This may be one factor explaining the dominance of mallards in the hybrid swarm. To analyse hybridisation at the genetic level, I analysed samples from <b>grey</b> <b>ducks,</b> mallards and domestic ducks with 11 microsatellite loci. This genotyping profile was then compared to ducks captured and shot in New Zealand. Genetic analysis confirms that the ducks in New Zealand were almost exclusively of hybrid origin. Phenotypic hybrid scores correlated with the established genotypic scores, but the correlation was imperfect, suggesting inaccuracies in either or both measures. As the spread of hybrids might be due to the differences in their fitness relative to either parent species, I compared the relative fitness of hybrid ducks using a range of health-related measures such as ecto- and endoparasite loads, immunocompetence, body condition, and heterophil to lymphocyte ratios. Overall, I found no conclusive evidence for any differences between grey duck-like and mallard-like individuals. However, as my sample consisted nearly entirely of hybrids, it is possible that fitness may differ from the parental species. To understand the outcome of hybridisation between two species, I next constructed a mathematical model to simulate hybridisation, and which allowed the specification of parameters describing mating patterns, differential survival, and differential reproductive output. The model successfully predicted the outcomes of two known hybridisation cases. In a sensitivity analysis for mallard and <b>grey</b> <b>duck,</b> the model predicted that this species pair is likely to hybridise under any set of conditions likely to be encountered across their shared range. Finally, in a study within the more general context of hybridisation, the influence of inbreeding on hybridisation rates was investigated using inbred and outbred lines of Drosophila species. I found evidence for increased hybridisation in inbred lines, and although further studies are needed to confirm the generality of this pattern, my results have implications for the management of hybridisation, and for the use of hybridisation as an adaptive strategy. In conclusion, my work suggests it is very likely that the <b>grey</b> <b>duck</b> will become extinct as a separate species in New Zealand in the near future, and that it is likely to be threatened in other areas of its range were it co-occurs with the mallard. The options for management of this situation are limited, as large areas without mallards are lacking. Captive breeding, or the management of <b>grey</b> <b>duck</b> populations on isolated islands appear the only feasible options. It seems unlikely that hybridisation can be reversed on the mainland, and a homogenous hybrid population is likely to eventually occupy the entire range of the <b>grey</b> <b>duck</b> across New Zealand...|$|R

5000|$|The New Zealand {{subspecies}} {{has declined}} sharply in numbers, {{at least in}} its pure form, due to competition from and hybridisation with the introduced mallard. Rhymer et al. (1994) say their data [...] "points to the eventual loss of identity of the <b>grey</b> <b>duck</b> as a separate species in New Zealand, and the subsequent dominance of a hybrid swarm akin to the Mariana Mallard." [...] It was assumed that far more mallard drakes mate with <b>grey</b> <b>duck</b> females than vice versa {{based on the fact}} that most hybrids show a mallard-type plumage, but this is not correct; it appears that the mallard phenotype is dominant, and that the degree to which species contributed to a hybrid's ancestry cannot be determined from the plumage. The main reasons for displacement of the pārera seem to be physical dominance of the larger mallards, combined with a marked population decline of the pārera due to overhunting in the mid-20th century.|$|R

500|$|Over time, a {{continuum}} of hybrids ranging between almost typical examples of either species develop; the speciation process is beginning to reverse itself. This has created conservation concerns for relatives of the mallard, such as the Hawaiian duck, the New Zealand <b>grey</b> <b>duck</b> (A.s. superciliosa) subspecies of the Pacific black duck, the American black duck, the mottled duck, Meller's duck, the yellow-billed duck, and the Mexican duck, {{in the latter case}} even leading to a dispute as to whether these birds should be considered a species (and thus entitled to more conservation research and funding) or included in the mallard species. Ecological changes and hunting have also led to a decline of local species; for example, the New Zealand <b>grey</b> <b>duck</b> population declined drastically due to overhunting in the mid-20th century. Hybrid offspring of Hawaiian ducks seem to be less well adapted to native habitat, and using them in re-introduction projects apparently reduces success. In summary, the problems of mallards [...] "hybridising away" [...] relatives is more a consequence of local ducks declining than of mallards spreading; allopatric speciation and isolating behaviour have produced today's diversity of mallard-like ducks despite the fact that, in most, if not all, of these populations, hybridisation must have occurred to some extent.|$|R
