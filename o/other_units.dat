5|$|Desertion was {{a problem}} for the 24th Infantry; the 25th Infantry Division had to detain 116 deserters from the 24th Infantry during August, {{compared}} to 15 from the 27th Infantry and 12 from the 35th Infantry. In late August, Kean began investigating the unit's behavior, including its poor performance at the battle of Sangju several weeks earlier, and found its performance was affecting <b>other</b> <b>units</b> of the division. After the 24th's performance at the battles of Battle Mountain and Haman, Kean suggested to Walker that the regiment be disbanded and its troops be used as replacements for <b>other</b> <b>units</b> in the field. Virtually all of the officers and enlisted men in the regiment were supportive of this idea, but Walker declined, feeling he could not afford to lose a regiment. Even if his <b>other</b> <b>units</b> were reinforced, he did not feel they could be extended to cover the entire line.|$|E
5|$|For {{the size}} of limitanei units, opinion is divided. Jones and Elton suggest from the scarce and {{ambiguous}} literary evidence that border legiones numbered c. 1,000 men and that the <b>other</b> <b>units</b> contained {{in the region of}} 500 men each. Others draw on papyrus and more recent archaeological evidence to argue that limitanei units probably averaged about half the Jones/Elton strength i.e. c. 500 for legiones and around 250 for <b>other</b> <b>units.</b>|$|E
5|$|The war {{came to an}} end in mid-August 1945 {{following}} Japan's surrender in {{the wake}} of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. At the conclusion of the fighting, the 2/6th remained in New Guinea, concentrating in the area around Wewak. The battalion's strength was slowly reduced as personnel were repatriated back to Australia individually for demobilisation based upon a formal points system. On 13 December 1945, the battalion's remaining personnel sailed for Australia, eventually returning to Puckapunyal. As the battalion's personnel were slowly demobilised or transferred out to <b>other</b> <b>units</b> its strength decreased rapidly until it was finally disbanded on 18 February 1946. Those personnel who were not discharged were transferred to <b>other</b> <b>units</b> for further service.|$|E

5|$|A second Anglo-Franco-Hellenic {{force would}} then attack the 1st Bulgarian Army between Kožuf and Lake Doiran, {{preventing}} it from forming new defensive {{positions in the}} area. The initial advance would allow the Armée d'Orient to progress in support of <b>other</b> <b>units</b> first to Prilep, Disma and Borran. In the meantime, an Anglo-Hellenic force would strike Mount Belasica, occupying the Rupel Pass.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{strained}} the UN logistics system {{was the lack}} of a previously drafted resupply plan. Consumption rates differed among the various units {{and as a result of}} a lack of coordination, some UN units faced supply shortages when <b>other</b> <b>units</b> would request more material than they actually needed. In order to rectify this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a plan as the need arose.|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War progressed, so did {{the need}} for new {{aircraft}} and techniques. The first KC-97 Stratofreighter arrived at Loring with the activation of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron in January 1955. The B-36's were not actually equipped to perform aerial refueling, so the planes supported <b>other</b> <b>units</b> until the arrival of the B-52 in 1956. Eventually, 21 tankers were based at Loring, along with 30 air crews.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Moor quickly apologized. While General Ewing {{respected}} {{the discipline of}} the German regiment, he preferred a different atmosphere in his own command, better suited to Americans. He was capable of recognizing the military tradition of <b>other</b> <b>units</b> while accommodating {{the unique needs of}} his own. General Ewing was ordered to North Carolina in 1865, and was planning an expedition up the Roanoke river to co-operate with the Army of the James, when Lee surrendered.|$|E
50|$|Any {{confusion}} over {{the meaning of}} the term return or rate of return should be avoided.

5|$|Desertion had {{continued}} to be a problem for the 24th Infantry, a de facto segregated unit. Statistics compiled by the Eighth Army found the 25th Infantry Division had to detain 116 deserters from the 25th Infantry throughout August, compared to 15 from the 27th Infantry and 12 from the 35th Infantry. The regiment had already been criticized for its poor performance at the Battle of Sangju several weeks earlier. In late August, Kean began investigating the unit's behavior, and found its poor performance was starting to bring <b>other</b> <b>units</b> of the division down as well. Kean considered the regiment a weak link in the chain, and after its poor performance at the battles of Battle Mountain and Haman, he suggested to Walker that the regiment be disbanded and its troops used as replacements for <b>other</b> <b>units</b> in the field. Virtually all of the officers and enlisted men in the regiment were supportive of this idea, but Walker declined, feeling he could not afford to lose a regiment.|$|E
5|$|However as {{the army}} took shape, French {{officers}} were allocated to units as they presented themselves for duty, so that many units were commanded by officers the soldiers didn't know, and often didn't trust. Crucially, {{some of these}} officers had little experience in working together as a unified force, so that support for <b>other</b> <b>units</b> was often not given.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, Charles Bright and Latimer Clark {{proposed}} {{the names of}} ohm, volt, and farad in honour of Georg Ohm, Alessandro Volta and Michael Faraday respectively for the practical units based on the centimetre-gramme-second absolute system. This was supported by Thomson (Lord Kelvin) These names were later scaled {{for use in the}} Practical System. The concept of naming units of measure after noteworthy scientists was subsequently used for <b>other</b> <b>units.</b>|$|E

5|$|In July 1969, the {{battalion}} {{took part in}} Operations Virginia Ridge and Idaho Canyon, attempting to stop infiltrators from the PAVN 27th Regiment and 33rd Sapper Battalion from coming through the DMZ. The operation continued until September, when the 3rd Marine Regiment was ordered to stop operations in preparation for its redeployment back to the United States. The battalion began to depart on 7 October and had fully arrived at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton {{by the end of}} 1969. Many 3rd Battalion Marines with time still left on their tours of duty were transferred to <b>other</b> <b>units.</b> 3rd Battalion spent over 1,600 days in Vietnam and conducted 48 combat operations, the most of any Marine battalion in the conflict. 653 Marines who served in 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines lost their lives during the Vietnam War or were killed while operating with <b>other</b> <b>units.</b> Nearly 2,800 others were wounded.|$|E

5|$|In October 1862, Dow {{was given}} command over the District of Pensacola, {{and moved to}} join <b>other</b> <b>units</b> there.
