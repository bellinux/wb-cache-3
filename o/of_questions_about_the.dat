5|$|Twelve {{days after}} the disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese {{property}} consultant, became the first arguido. Born in Hammersmith, west London, Murat lived in his mother's house, Casa Liliana, 150 yards (137 m) from apartment 5A in {{the direction in which}} the man in the Tanner sighting had walked. He was made an arguido after a Sunday Mirror journalist told police he had been asking a lot <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> case. The Polícia Judiciária had briefly signed him up as an official interpreter; he said he had wanted to help because he had a daughter in England around Madeleine's age.|$|E
25|$|The Castle Bravo {{incident}} itself {{raised a}} number <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> survivability {{of a nuclear}} war. Government scientists in both the U.S. and the USSR had insisted that fusion weapons, unlike fission weapons, were cleaner, as fusion reactions did not produce the dangerously radioactive by-products of fission reactions. While technically true, this hid a more gruesome point: the last stage of a multi-staged hydrogen bomb often used the neutrons produced by the fusion reactions to induce fissioning in a jacket of natural uranium, and provided around half of the yield of the device itself.|$|E
25|$|A {{crucial point}} in the {{dialogue}} is when Socrates tells Meno {{that there is no}} such thing as teaching, only recollection of knowledge from past lives, or anamnesis. Socrates claims that he can demonstrate this by showing that one of Meno's servants, a slave boy, knows geometric principles though he is uneducated. Socrates states that he will teach the boy nothing, only ask him questions to assist the process of recollection. Socrates proceeds to ask the slave boy a series <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> size and length of lines and squares, using visual diagrams to aid the boy in understanding the questions. The crucial point to this part of the dialogue is that, though the boy has no training, he knows the correct answers to the questions – he intrinsically knows the Pythagorean proposition.|$|E

25|$|Through many initiatives, which {{includes}} the Diversity League Table consultation, Nwokolo has led BSN to work consistently {{in the direction of}} widening meaningful participation and access to legal services in the United Kingdom. She is noted for progressive vision in the following words: “Working with our partners we’re trying to move things forward in terms of creating a legal workforce drawn from the most meritorious. The inclusion <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> social background of lawyers, and lawyers to be, represents an important new phase of the consultation.” This crucial Diversity League Table reporting has four main diversity areas; namely: gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disabilities. Focusing on the demographic composition of law firms and chambers, results are shown as a sequence of organisation profiles and successive leagues tables; ranking participants in major areas, and also showing an overall ranking on the complete Diversity League Table.|$|E

500|$|Between Farmer's {{freshman}} and sophomore years, the NCAA banned Eric Manuel from playing in any further NCAA games because <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> legitimacy of his ACT scores and levied a two-year postseason ban, a one-year ban on televised games, and scholarship reductions against Kentucky {{as punishment for}} payments allegedly made to the father of Chris Mills.

500|$|Michelle Erica Green, {{while writing}} for the website TrekNation, thought that the episode had strong {{character}} development despite the other flaws present. She felt that it opened up a number <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> abilities of the Andorians due to their similarity to the Aenar, and enjoyed the issues present in the Tucker/T'Pol relationship. Although she {{said that it was}} the [...] "weakest" [...] of the story arc, it was also the most [...] "gripping". Jamahl Epsicokhan, at his website Jammer's Reviews, gave the episode two out of four, adding that [...] "The Aenar" [...] was [...] "aimless" [...] since the majority of the storyline ended in the previous episode. He found fault with the plot, as the Romulan threat was unspecific, and because of several plot holes which the episode failed to explain.|$|E
500|$|Peart was {{introduced}} to photographer Carrie Nuttall in Los Angeles by long-time Rush photographer Andrew MacNaughtan. They married on September 9, 2000. In early 2001, Peart announced to his bandmates that {{he was ready to}} return to recording and performing. The product of the band's return was the 2002 album Vapor Trails. At the start of the ensuing tour in support of the album, it was decided amongst the band members that Peart would not take part in the daily grind of press interviews and [...] "meet and greet" [...] sessions upon their arrival in a new city that typically monopolize a touring band's daily schedule. Peart has always shied away from these types of in-person encounters, and it was decided that exposing him to a lengthy stream <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> tragic events of his life was not necessary.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN gave {{a glowing}} review, giving the episode a 9 out of 10, {{indicating}} {{that it was}} [...] "amazing." [...] He wrote that [...] "most of the major mysteries established this season are given a satisfying and proper conclusion." [...] He praised how the episode combined all the second season storylines, including the mysteries and the Neptune High portion of Veronica's life. [...] "The final scenes do a very nice job of closing the high school chapter of the Veronica Mars story, while also leaving plenty <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future of some characters in particular." [...] Goldman also lauded the performances of Kristen Bell and Enrico Colantoni, writing that [...] "As always, Kristen Bell and Enrico Colantoni knock {{it out of the}} park, with Bell especially having to go through a rather stunning amount of emotional transitions, all of which she does spectacularly." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Netherlands, where {{autograph}} {{books are}} very popular among young schoolchildren, publishers have recently started bringing out an alternative {{in the so-called}} vriendenboek or vriendjesboek ("Friends book"), which much like the confession album come preprinted with a set <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> respondents' hobbies, idols and wishes.

2500|$|The low {{concentration}} of homeopathic preparations, which often lack {{even a single}} molecule of the diluted substance, has been the basis <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> effects of the preparations since the 19th century.

This concept is inconsistent with the current understanding of matter, and water memory has never been demonstrated to have any detectable effect, biological or otherwise.
