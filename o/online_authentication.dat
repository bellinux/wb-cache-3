25|$|Ubisoft {{formally}} {{announced a}} return to <b>online</b> <b>authentication</b> on 9 February 2010, through its Uplay online gaming platform, starting with , , and Assassin's Creed II. Silent Hunter 5 was first reported to have been compromised within 24 hours of release, but users of the cracked version soon found out that only early parts of the game were playable. The Uplay system works by having the installed game on the local PCs incomplete and then continuously downloading parts of the game-code from Ubisoft's servers as the game progresses. It {{was more than a}} month after the PC release {{in the first week of}} April that software was released that could bypass Ubisoft's DRM in Assassin's Creed II. The software did this by emulating a Ubisoft server for the game. Later that month, a real crack was released that was able to remove the connection requirement altogether.|$|E
2500|$|Digital rights {{management}} (DRM) {{is a type}} {{of technology}} that is intended to control the use of digital content and devices after purchase. [...] Many companies make use of DRM to prevent copyright infringement and to protect an entity's intellectual property from public access. [...] Opponents of DRM argue that it only inconveniences legitimate customers and allows big business to stifle innovation and competition. In the US, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 increased the strength of DRM. Objection to DRM caused Microsoft to change its DRM policy for Xbox One. Always-on digital rights management (DRM), also known as persistent <b>online</b> <b>authentication,</b> {{is a type of}} controversial technology relating to video games. This technology requires a consumer to maintain a connection to a host server in order to use a particular product or play a game. Those against Always-on DRM focus on server connection difficulties, single player offline preferences, and game playability once companies shut down a server.|$|E

40|$|Most secure {{web sites}} use the SSL/TLS {{protocol}} for server authentication. SSL/TLS supports mutual authentication, i. e. both server and client authentication. However, this optional feature of SSL/TLS {{is not used}} by most web sites because not every client has a certified public key. Instead user authentication is typically achieved by sending a password to the server after {{the establishment of an}} SSL-protected channel. Certain attacks rely on this fact, such as web spoofing and phishing attacks. In this paper the issue of <b>online</b> user <b>authentication</b> is discussed, and a method for <b>online</b> user <b>authentication</b> using trusted computing platforms is proposed.

Even seemingly innocent interactions, such as social media postings, can have serious consequences if used fraudulently. A key problem in modern online interactions is establishing {{the identity of the}} user without alienating the user. Historically, almost all <b>online</b> <b>authentications</b> have been implemented using simple passwords, but increasingly these methods are under attack. Multifactor authentication requires the presentation of two or more of the three authentication factor types: “What you know”, “What you have”, and “What you are”. After presentation, each factor must be validated by the other party for authentication to occur. Multifactor authentication is a potential solution to the authentication problem, and it is beginning to be implemented at websites operated by well-known companies. This article surveys the different mechanisms used to implement multifactor authentication. How a site chooses to implement multifactor authentication affects security as well as the overall user experience...|$|R

40|$|A major {{challenge}} for E-commerce and content-based businesses {{is the possibility}} of altering identity documents or other digital data. This paper shows a watermark-based approach to protect digital identity documents against a Print-Scan (PS) attack. We propose a secure ID card authentication system based on watermarking. For authentication purposes, a user/customer is asked to upload a scanned picture of a passport or ID card through the internet to fulfill a transaction online. To provide security in online ID card submission, we need to robustly encode personal information of ID card’s holder into the card itself, and then extract the hidden information correctly in a decoder after the PS operation. The PS operation imposes several distortions, such as geometric, rotation, and histogram distortion, on the watermark location, which may cause the loss of information in the watermark. An <b>online</b> secure <b>authentication</b> system needs to first eliminate the distortion of the PS operation before decoding the hidden data. This study proposes five preprocessing blocks to remove the distortions of the PS operation: filtering, localization, binarization, undoing rotation, and cropping. Experimental results with 100 ID cards showed that the proposed <b>online</b> ID card <b>authentication</b> system has an average accuracy of 99 % in detecting hidden information inside ID cards after the PS process. The innovations of this study are the implementation of an <b>online</b> watermark-based <b>authentication</b> system which uses a scanned ID card picture without any added frames around the watermark location, unlike previous systems...|$|R
