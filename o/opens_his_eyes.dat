25|$|After {{some time}} of peace, Glaurung returns to exterminate {{the men of}} Brethil. Turambar leads an {{expedition}} to cut him off, and stabs Glaurung from beneath while the dragon is crossing a ravine. As Glaurung is dying {{on the bank of}} the ravine, Turambar pulls his sword from the dragon's belly, and blood spurts onto his hand and burns him. Overwhelmed with pain and fatigue, he faints. Niënor finds him and mistakes his swoon for death. In a last effort of malice Glaurung <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and informs her that she and Turambar are brother and sister. Glaurung then dies, and his spell of forgetfulness passes from Niënor. Remembering her entire life and knowing that her unborn child was begotten in incest, she throws herself from the nearby cliff into the river Taeglin and is washed away. When Turambar wakes, Brandir informs him of Niënor's death and of their true relationship as siblings, as he had overheard the dragon's words. Mablung confirms Brandir's tale, and Turambar takes his own life upon his sword.|$|E
25|$|Grand Master Oogway, an old {{tortoise}} and Shifu's mentor, has {{a vision}} that Shifu's former student, the evil snow leopard Tai Lung, will escape from prison {{and return to the}} Valley of Peace to take revenge for being denied the Dragon Scroll, which is said to hold the secret to limitless power. Shifu is alarmed and sends his messenger, the goose Zeng, with a request for the prison to heighten security in order to prevent Tai Lung's escape. He then holds a kung fu tournament for the Furious Five so that Oogway may identify the Dragon Warrior, the one kung fu master worthy of receiving the Dragon Scroll and capable of defeating Tai Lung. Forced to take a cumbersome noodle cart to the tournament, Po arrives as the arena doors close and is unable to enter. Desperate to see the Dragon Warrior chosen, Po straps himself to a set of fireworks, rockets into the sky, and crashes {{into the middle of the}} arena and <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to see Oogway pointing his finger at him. To the shock of everyone present, Oogway proclaims Po as the Dragon Warrior.|$|E

500|$|The Season 2 episode [...] "Los Moscos" [...] has Management urge Ben to seek Scudder; Ben {{needs to}} learn {{the name of the}} preacher of his dreams (Brother Justin) to prevent a future catastrophe. An induced vision {{transports}} Ben into a desert where he suddenly hears an alarm-like noise. A massive explosion occurs, followed by a rising mushroom cloud. When Ben <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> from the blast of dust, Justin kneels {{in front of him and}} asks [...] "Ye offspring of serpents, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?" [...] Ben drives past this location one episode later in [...] "Alamogordo, NM". In a shared vision in the episode [...] "Creed, OK", Ben and Sofie kiss in a desert, surrounded by bright light and swirling dust. Season 2 takes place in 1935.|$|E
500|$|Several {{scenes from}} the script were cut during filming, {{most of which were}} brief time lapses or {{transitioning}} scenes, or title screens deemed unnecessary. One of the more substantial scenes to be cut involved the ghost of Alan at a cemetery. The scene with the town clerk berating Dr. Caligari deviated notably from the original script, which simply called for the clerk to be [...] "impatient". He is far more abusive in the scene as it was filmed, and is perched atop an exaggeratedly high bench that towers over Dr. Caligari. Another deviation from the script comes when Dr. Caligari first awakens Cesare, {{one of the most famous}} moments in the film. The script called for Cesare to gasp and struggle for air, then shake violently and collapse in Dr. Caligari's arms. As it was filmed, there is no such physical struggling, and instead the camera zooms in on Cesare's face as he gradually <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> The original title cards for Caligari featured stylized, misshapen lettering with excessive underlinings, exclamation points and occasionally archaic spellings. The bizarre style, which matches that of the film as a whole, mimics the lettering of Expressionistic posters at the time. The original title cards were tinted in green, steely-blue and brown. Many modern prints of the film do not preserve the original lettering.|$|E
500|$|Early {{in series}} ten, Joseph's brother's {{condition}} deteriorates {{and he is}} admitted to Holby City Hospital in need of an operation. [...] Faye supports Joseph, and the two kiss. Joseph's hopes are raised when his brother <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and he considers expensive neurology treatment in America to try and rouse Harry from his coma. Shortly thereafter, however, Harry's condition worsens again, and Joseph and his mother allow Harry to die. Following his brother's death, Joseph returns to work to find Jac on trial for Sam's old position. This reignites their feud, and Joseph is unable to block Jac from gaining the position. His relationship with Faye develops slowly, however Joseph's suspicions are raised when she lies to him about her whereabouts on several occasions, leading to the eventual discovery that the police suspect her {{of the murder of}} her second husband, Donald. An exhumation reveals that Donald did not die of cancer, as Faye insisted, but of arsenic poisoning. Joseph remains suspicious, but supports Faye as their relationship continues to develop. When Faye has a pregnancy scare, he proposes to her, and insists that he meant it even after the discovery she is not actually pregnant. Joseph is devastated when Faye appears to have stolen £5,000 from him and left the country, but discovers she is in fact in trouble in South Africa. After flying out with colleague Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow), Faye reveals she has a ten-year-old son, Archie, who lives in a care home because of a genetic disease. Joseph saves Archie's life in a risky operation, and he and Faye return from South Africa engaged once more, much to Jac's chagrin.|$|E

2500|$|The novel {{centers around}} John Redlantern, a [...] "newhair" [...] (teenager) who hates the deep social and {{technological}} conservatism of Family. Killing a deadly leopard {{proves to be}} an epiphany which <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to the Malthusian catastrophe facing Family, which has grown too large for its tiny valley. Supported by pretty Tina Spikestree and John's cousins (the somewhat passive teenaged Gerry and the club footed pre-adolescent, thoughtful Jeff), John engages {{in a series of}} iconoclastic acts which lead to the [...] "breaking" [...] of Family. Exile of John and his teenaged followers is only the first of many ramifications, as John leads a messianic quest for a land [...] "over Cold Dark" [...] where Family can grow and thrive.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{days later}} Vosill {{receives}} {{a note from}} Adlain, asking her to meet him and two other Dukes elsewhere in the castle. [...] She leaves alone, but Oelph opts to follow her in secret; after catching a glimpse of someone fleeing, he arrives in time to be arrested by the guard, who proceed to discover Vosill standing over {{the body of a}} murdered Duke, stabbed with one of her scalpels. [...] Vosill and Oelph are almost immediately delivered to Ralinge, who binds the two separately and then strips, intending to rape, Vosill. The woman issues what sounds to Oelph like commands, albeit in a language he does not recognize even partially. [...] Oelph's eyes are closed at this point, and in his narrative he is unable to adequately describe what he hears next, other than an impression of wind and metal. [...] When he <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> he finds Ralinge and his assistants dead, dispatched bloodily, and Vosill free and in the process of removing her bindings, no indication of how she was freed. [...] Later, she claims that Oelph fell unconscious and the three men fought over who would rape her first, though she indicates to him that this is what he [...] "should" [...] remember.|$|E
2500|$|JR is {{eventually}} informed of Babe's one-night stand with Josh {{by her father}} (David Hayward). Not believing it, even when Josh confirms the encounter, viewers saw JR try {{to move on with}} his life and be happy with Babe. Once his suspicion gets the better of him, however, he confronts Babe about the matter. Babe tells the truth, and, in a dramatic fashion, JR later throws himself out a two-story window while drunk. While recovering, he insists that he no longer loves Babe. To add further conflict, Babe is written as thoroughly determined to win JR back; she undermines his wishes not to live with her. [...] "Babe is at the Chandler mansion. JR is home from the hospital and Babe isn't letting up," [...] said Havins. [...] "She's very dedicated to getting through to him. She's not saying, 'Let's get back together and forget anything ever happened.' It's more like, 'Let's try to move forward.' They aren't having an 'I love you' moment or anything like that, but she breaks the ice a little bit." [...] In addition, Babe's refusal to let JR go is happening during a serial killer arc, where Babe's life is in danger and one of her good friends (Erin Lavery) has just been murdered by the killer. In a moment where Babe confides to JR about this, viewers again witnessed the couple's star-crossed theme. [...] "He's sleeping and she is crying at his bedside and says, 'I need you so much.' Not only is she going through this, but she doesn't have her rock and best friend to lean on," [...] stated Havins. [...] "It's a lonely place to be. He <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and almost makes the move to connect — but then he doesn't." ...|$|E
