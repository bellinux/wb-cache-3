The problem {{is different from the}} problem of <b>optimizing</b> linear combinations of base rankers as the scoring function of a base ranker may be highly non-linear. For the sake of concreteness, we focus on the optimization of a specific base ranker, viz. BM 25. We start by showing that significant improvements in performance can be obtained when <b>optimizing</b> the parameters of BM 25 for individual datasets.
