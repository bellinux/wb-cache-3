50|$|Object {{creation}} can {{be broken}} down into two operations: memory allocation and initialization, where initialization both includes assigning values to <b>object</b> fields <b>and</b> possibly running arbitrary other code. These are implementation-level concepts, roughly analogous to the distinction between declaration <b>and</b> initialization (or <b>definition)</b> of a variable, though these later are language-level distinctions. For an object that is tied to a variable, declaration may be compiled to memory allocation (reserving space for the <b>object),</b> <b>and</b> <b>definition</b> to initialization (assigning values), but declarations may also be for compiler use only (such as name resolution), not directly corresponding to compiled code.|$|R
50|$|Dynamic {{programming}} language, {{in computer}} science, is {{a class of}} high-level programming languages which, at runtime, execute many common programming behaviors that static programming languages perform during compilation. These behaviors could include extension of the program, by adding new code, by extending <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions,</b> or by modifying the type system. Although similar behaviours can be emulated in nearly any language, {{with varying degrees of}} difficulty, complexity and performance costs, dynamic languages provide direct tools to make use of them.

On the other hand, class-based models have powerful mechanisms to control redundancy, exploit sharing, express extension, and propagate changes to instances. The price object-based approaches pay is {{loss of control}} over change propagation, and potential redundancy. Two mechanisms to overcome this are sharing among <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> <b>definition</b> of <b>objects</b> as extension of others. We examine these mechanisms, and consider the effect that interacting policies for <b>objects</b> sharing <b>and</b> definition-byextension have onchange propagation and replication control.

40|$|Critics have {{constantly}} {{engaged in}} the topic of how male Romantic-era writers’ views of language influenced their writing, in particular their subjective and arbitrary descriptions and illustrations {{of the world to}} create new meanings of <b>objects,</b> thoughts <b>and</b> ideas. Yet, despite the numerous critiques on male writers, {{there is a lack of}} research and examination of women Romantic-era writers’ reflections on and responses to the male writers’ views of language and how the male writers’ views of language influence their writing. In particular, Mary Shelley is one such writer that subjects the male writers’ beliefs of language to critique in her novelFrankenstein. This essay argues that inFrankenstein,Mary’s use of intertexuality combats the subjective view of language found in the male writers’ works because the intertextual moments within literature expands the engagement and understanding of language beyond the dimensions of personal and subjective views. The interweaving of and references to Percy Shelley’s works, the Bible and Milton’sParadise Lostin her writing, I claim, structures and stabilizes language in order to reveal a larger context of the meaning of words that reinforce a universal understanding of a correlation between words, <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Patients with {{semantic}} dementia are impaired in both <b>object</b> naming <b>and,</b> to {{a lesser}} extent, in object use. To date there have been relatively few studies examining the relearning of <b>object</b> names, <b>and</b> only one examining the relearning of object use. No study has examined relearning <b>object</b> naming, <b>definition,</b> <b>and</b> use simultaneously. Aims: To explore the relatedness of <b>object</b> naming, <b>definition,</b> <b>and</b> <b>object</b> use in semantic dementia; to explore whether or not therapy is effective; and to explore the effectiveness of errorless learning. Methods & Procedures: Two patients with mild to moderate semantic dementia and two matched control participants were tested in naming, defining, and demonstrating the use of 33 household objects. The quality of the definitions was rated as poor, adequate, or good by three independent raters. Three components of object use were examined: hold, orientation, and movement. The assessment was repeated with the patients following 3 weeks of therapy, and 1 month after completion of therapy. For the therapy, objects were divided into individual trained and untrained sets based on familiarity and performance at initial assessment. Patients received therapy sessions twice weekly, and engaged in independent practice. During the therapy sessions, the researcher modeled the name, <b>definition,</b> <b>and</b> use of each item, which the patient then repeated. In the independent practice each patient watched a DVD in which she named <b>and</b> defined the <b>object</b> <b>and</b> used it correctly. Outcomes & Results: Patients were severely impaired on <b>object</b> naming <b>and</b> <b>definition,</b> but less so on object use. Both patients showed some improvement {{as a result of}} therapy, which was maintained at follow-up in one case. Conclusions: The results show that relearning in semantic dementia is possible. Factors affecting the results and the interaction between lexical and conceptual impairments are discussed. An unexpected finding of the study was that patients performed better in verb production both in the preliminary tests <b>and</b> in <b>object</b> <b>definition...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{visibility}} {{representation of}} a graph G is an assignment of the vertices of G to geometric objects such that vertices are adjacent {{if and only if}} their corresponding objects are "visible" each other, that is, there is an uninterrupted channel, usually axis-aligned, between them. Depending on the <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> <b>definition</b> of visibility used, not all graphs are visibility graphs. In such situations, one may be able to obtain a visibility {{representation of a}} graph G by allowing vertices to be assigned to more than one object. The visibility number of a graph G is the minimum t such that G has a representation in which each vertex is assigned to at most t objects. In this paper, we explore visibility numbers of trees when the vertices are assigned to unit hypercubes in R^n. We use two different models of visibility: when lines of sight can be parallel to any standard basis vector of R^n, and when lines of sight are only parallel to the nth standard basis vector in R^n. We establish relationships between these visibility models and their connection to trees with certain cubicity values. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
