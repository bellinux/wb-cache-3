The program, called IBM in atoms, used a {{scanning tunneling microscope}} to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms on a substrate of chilled crystal of nickel to spell out the three letter company initialism. It {{was the first time}} atoms had been precisely positioned <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|Borobudur differs {{markedly}} {{from the}} general design of other structures built for this purpose. Instead of being built <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surface,</b> Borobudur is built on a natural hill. However, construction technique is similar to other temples in Java. Without the inner spaces seen in other temples, and with a general design similar {{to the shape of}} pyramid, Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a stupa, instead of a temple. A stupa is intended as a shrine for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship. The meticulous complexity of the monument's design suggests that Borobudur is in fact a temple.|$|E
5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surface.</b> It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E

5|$|The Odyssey {{consists}} of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular controllers. The primary console box connects to the television set through an included switchbox, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel. The controllers, which are designed to sit <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surface,</b> contain one button marked Reset {{on the top of}} the controller and three knobs: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other. The reset button does not reset the game, but instead is used by different games to reset individual elements, such as making a player's dot visible after it is turned off during a game. The system can be powered by six C batteries, which were included. An optional AC power supply was sold separately. The Odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen.|$|E

25|$|Clement Greenberg proclaimed {{abstract}} expressionism and Jackson Pollock in particular as {{the epitome of}} aesthetic value. He supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via Cubism and Cézanne to Monet, in which painting became ever-'purer' and more concentrated in what was 'essential' to it, the making of marks <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

25|$|Ingredients to make pasta dough include {{semolina}} flour, egg, {{salt and}} water. Flour is first mounded <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> {{and then a}} well in the pile of flour is created. Egg is then poured into the well and a fork is used to mix the egg and flour.

25|$|From {{the above}} angle sum formula {{we can also}} see that the Earth's surface is locally flat: If we draw an {{arbitrarily}} small triangle {{in the neighborhood of}} one point on the Earth's surface, the fraction f of the Earth's surface which is enclosed by the triangle will be arbitrarily close to zero. In this case the angle sum formula simplifies to 180°, which we know is what Euclidean geometry tells us for triangles <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} for a coin to land on its edge, usually by landing up against an object (such as a shoe) or by getting stuck in the ground. However, even <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> it {{is possible}} for a coin to land on its edge, with a chance of about 1 in 6000 for an American nickel. Angular momentum typically prevents most coins from landing on their edges unsupported if flipped. Such cases in which a coin does land on its edge are exceptionally rare and in most cases the coin is simply re-flipped.|$|E
25|$|The landing {{was made}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surface,</b> with the lander {{reporting}} only 0.3 degrees of tilt. Just before landing, the craft used its thrusters to orient its solar panels along an east-west axis to maximize power generation. The lander waited 15 minutes before opening its solar panels, to allow dust to settle. The first {{images from the}} lander became available around 7:00p.m. PDT (2008-05-26 02:00 UTC). The images show a surface strewn with pebbles and incised with small troughs into polygons about 5 m across and 10cm high, with the expected absence of large rocks and hills.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{concepts}} {{were common}} through the 1940s and 1950s, differing {{primarily in the}} way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The Geer tube was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surface.</b> The Penetron used three layers of phosphor {{on top of each other}} and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The Chromatron used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The total {{absolute}} {{geodesic curvature}} functional on regular curves in a Riemann surface is studied. Its behavior under regular homotopies, its infima, and the homotopy types of spaces of its local minima are determined in special cases. (As a byproduct {{we find the}} homotopy type of the space of free curves <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surfaces.)</b> The total curvature functional on the space of 2 -sphere immersions into 3 -space is studied in a similar spirit. The infimum over all sphere eversions of the maximum of the total curvature during an eversion is shown to be at most 8 π. We prove a non-injectivity result for local minima of the total curvature functional. (The proof gives a partial {{solution to a problem}} posed by Kuiper and Meeks [9].) 1...|$|R

25|$|Coins {{can also}} be spun <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> such as a table. This results in the {{following}} phenomenon: as the coin falls over and rolls on its edge, it spins faster and faster (formally, the precession rate of the symmetry axis of the coin, i.e., the axis passing from one face of the coin to the other) before coming to an abrupt stop. This is mathematically modeled as a finite-time singularity – the precession rate is accelerating to infinity, before it suddenly stops, and has been studied using high speed photography and devices such as Euler's Disk. The slowing down is predominantly caused by rolling friction (air resistance is minor), and the singularity (divergence of the precession rate) can be modeled as a power law with exponent approximately −1/3.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} that the gas mixture in a cylinder is thoroughly mixed before analysing or the results will be inaccurate. When partial pressure or mass blending is done at low flow rates the gases entering the cylinder are not moving fast enough to ensure good mixing, and particularly when blends contain Helium, they may tend to remain in layers due to density differences. This is termed stratification, and if left long enough, diffusion will ensure complete mixing. However, if the gas is to be analysed soon after blending, mechanical agitation is recommended. This may be by lying a single cylinder <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> and rolling it for a short period, but twins are more usually inverted a few times. Stratification is more pronounced with blends containing helium, but can also lead to inaccurate analysis of Nitrox blends.|$|E
25|$|Machine {{quilting}} is {{the process}} of using a home sewing machine or a longarm machine to sew the layers together. With the home sewing machine, the layers are tacked together before quilting. This involves laying the top, batting, and backing out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> and either pinning (using large safety pins) or tacking the layers together. Longarm quilting involves placing the layers to be quilted on a special frame. The frame has bars on which the layers are rolled, keeping these together without the need for tacking or pinning. These frames are used with a professional sewing machine mounted on a platform. The platform rides along tracks so that the machine can be moved across the layers on the frame. A longarm machine is moved across the fabric. In contrast, the fabric is moved through a home sewing machine.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of complete vessels come from early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, allowing similar glass vessel to be grouped together creating typologies. More recent excavations of contemporary settlements have revealed fragments of similar vessels types, indicating there are few, if any, differences between domestic glass and those ritually deposited in graves. There is {{a significant difference between}} Roman and Anglo-Saxon vessel forms, and glass working techniques became more limited. Few of the Anglo-Saxon forms can be classified as tableware, as this term implies to some extent that vessels can be set <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surface.</b> The forms used had primarily rounded or pointed bases, or when bases were present would have been too top heavy and unstable. This implies that vessels were held in the hand until the drink was completed. The evidence for glass vessels is patchier in the 8th century, as the number of complete vessels found decreases. This {{is directly related to the}} introduction of Christianity and the change in burial rite.|$|E
25|$|Most snakes move using lateral {{undulation}} where {{a lateral}} wave travels down the snake's {{body in the}} opposite direction to the snake's motion and pushes the snake off irregularities in the ground. This mode of locomotion requires these irregularities to function. Another form of locomotion, rectilinear locomotion, is used at times by some snakes, especially large ones such as pythons and boa. Here large scales {{on the underside of the}} body, known as scutes are used to push backwards and downwards. This is effective <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> and is used for slow, silent movement, such as when stalking prey. Snakes use concertina locomotion for moving slowly in tunnels, here the snake alternates in bracing parts of its body on it surrounds. Finally the caenophidian snakes use the fast and unusual method of movement known as sidewinding on sand or loose soil. The snake cycles through throwing the front part of its body in the direction of motion and bringing the back part of its body into line crosswise.|$|E
25|$|A brown recluse's stance <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> {{is usually}} with all legs {{radially}} extended. When alarmed it may lower its body, withdraw the forward two legs straight rearward into a defensive position, withdraw the rearmost pair of legs {{into a position}} for lunging forward, and stand motionless with pedipalps raised. The pedipalps in mature specimens are dark and quite prominent and are normally held horizontally forward. When threatened it usually flees, seemingly to avoid a conflict, and if detained may further avoid contact with quick horizontal rotating movements or even resort to assuming a lifeless pose (playing dead). The spider does not usually jump unless touched brusquely, and even then its avoidance movement {{is more of a}} horizontal lunge rather than a vaulting of itself entirely off the surface. When running, the brown recluse does not leave a silk line behind, which would make it more easily tracked when it is being pursued. Movement at virtually any speed is an evenly paced gait with legs extended. When missing a leg or two it appears to favor this same gait, although (presumably when a leg has been injured) it may move and stand at rest with one leg slightly withdrawn. During travel it stops naturally and periodically when renewing its internal hydraulic blood pressure that, like most spiders, it requires to renew strength in its legs.|$|E
