60|$|The {{experiences}} {{of the next day}} will remain for ever in my memory etched, as it were, in sepia. My guide was a younger officer who had seen heroic service, and I wondered constantly how his delicate frame had survived in the trenches the constant hardship of such weather as now, warmly wrapped and with the car-curtains drawn, we faced. The inevitable, relentless rain of that region had set in again, the rain in which our own soldiers will have to fight, and the skies were of a darkness seldom known in America. The countryside was no longer smiling. After some two hours of progress we came, in that devastated district near the front, to an expanse where many monsters were clumsily cavorting like dinosaurs in primeval slime. At some distance from the road others stood apparently tethered in line, awaiting their turn for exercise. These were the far-famed tanks. Their commander, or chief mahout--as I was inclined to call him--was a cheerful young giant of colonial origin, who has often driven them serenely across No Man's Land and into the German trenches. He had been expecting us, and led me along a duck board over the morass, to where one of these leviathans was awaiting us. You crawl through a greasy hole in the bottom, and the inside is as full of machinery as the turret of the Pennsylvania, and you grope your way to the seat in front beside that of the captain and conductor, looking out through a slot in the armour over a waste of water and mud. From here you are supposed to <b>operate</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> gun. Behind you two mechanics have started the engines with a deafening roar, above which are heard the hoarse commands of the captain as he grinds in his gears. Then you realize that the thing is actually moving, that the bosses on the belt have managed to find a grip on the slime--and presently you come to the brink of what appears, to your exaggerated sense of perception, a bottomless chasm, with distant steep banks on the farther side that look unattainable and insurmountable. It is an old German trench which the rains have worn and widened. You brace yourself, you grip desperately a pair of brass handles in front of you, while leviathan hesitates, seems to sit up on his haunches, and then gently buries his nose in the pasty clay and paws his way upward into the field beyond. It was like sitting in a huge rocking-chair. That we might have had a bump, and a bone-breaking one, I was informed after I had left the scene of the adventure. It all depends upon the skill of the driver. The monsters are not as tractable as they seem.|$|E

5000|$|In August 2001 {{she held}} an event at Castle von Buhler dubbed [...] "The Great Purge" [...] where she sold {{off most of}} her possessions. Von Buhler {{separated}} from Adam Buhler {{and moved to a}} 4500 sq ft artist loft in New York City's Meatpacking District. Farewell articles were published in The Boston Globe, The Improper Bostonian and The Boston Phoenix citing her as producing [...] "some of the most sensuous, humorous, ridiculous, outlandish, and inspired art and entertainment in Boston." [...] At this point von Buhler began utilizing unconventional media in her art: video projection, living fauna, found objects, human detritus, and electronic audio. By combining these media, often enhanced with text and electronics, von Buhler's canvasses frequently became kinetic installations. [...] "Regardless of medium, all of von Buhler's pieces require the viewer to get involved: sometimes physically, by feeding a caged animal or inserting a coin to <b>operate</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine.</b> For example, [...] "Sir Repetitious," [...] a man's transparent insides reveal two live rats, hungry for the food and attention of onlookers - feed the rodents with the supplied seed, and you are satisfying [...] "Sir Repetitious" [...] on physical and metaphorical levels. Miss Ann Thrope is a life-sized painting of a woman with two doves perched inside. When the birds move in the piece, they change its equilibrium and alter its intended meaning. A velvet-curtained puppet theater sets the stage for Show and Tell, a multimedia painting that explores the use of word versus action with hidden visual and auditory messages. [...] "Please Don’t Look Up My Skirt" [...] is a commentary on date-rape in which a Botticelli-esque girl without arms or legs tries modestly to cover herself, imploring the viewer not to violate her; those who disregard the plea see what they have become when they look up her skirt. Cynth-O-Matic offers various plastic capsules containing actual samples of the artist's body hair and fluids from a vending machine. The piece is von Buhler's critique of those who attend art openings to chat with the artist and scarf hors d’oeuvres without buying any art. For only 25 cents they can buy a piece of the artist. Von Buhler's work provides commentary on morality, vanity, politics, and the art world itself". From 2001 - 2007, von Buhler's work appeared on the covers of New York's Gallery Guide, Communication Arts, Step by Step Graphics,64 and NY Arts. A photograph of von Buhler taken at her New York loft for The Boston Globe was enlarged and used on billboards advertising the publication. Inspired by lying politicians, von Buhler altered and old carnival machine for [...] "Shake Hands With Uncle Sam." [...] For 25 cents, viewers shake Uncle Sam's hand, the dial spins, and lands on audio samples of [...] "Weapons of Mass Destruction," [...] "Iran Contra," [...] "No New Taxes," [...] or one of seven other bipartisan audio clips. The piece was created for [...] "The Presidency" [...] exhibit at Exit Art in Manhattan. [...] In 2005, von Buhler created a video for another exhibit at Exit Art, [...] "The Studio Visit". Her video was singled out by New York Times art critic Roberta Smith as one of the best. She also was chosen by the art space to move her art studio to the gallery for a few months where she had to create her work in the window while people watched her through Exit Art's windows. [...] Her fine art appeared on TV in Law & Order SVU as the artwork of a serial killer, and in a fight scene of the show Kidnapped. In March 2006, Art & Antiques named von Buhler as [...] "one of the top contemporary surrealists."However, she has also been linked to the Lowbrow, and Fluxus movements. Her art has been displayed in galleries and museums around the world, and her work is in the collections of Howard Stern, Jann Wenner, The Nassau County Museum of Art, The Staten Island Museum, The University of Toronto, The Opera Company of Philadelphia, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and hundreds of personal collections.|$|E

40|$|Brain-computer {{interface}} (BCI) allows {{collaboration between}} humans and machines. It translates the electrical activity of the brain to understandable commands to <b>operate</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> or a device. In this study, we propose a method to improve the accuracy of a 3 -class BCI using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This BCI discriminates rest against imaginary grasps and elbow movements of the same limb. This classification task is challenging because imaginary movements within the same limb have close spatial representations on the motor cortex area. The proposed method extracts time-domain features and classifies them using a support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis kernel function (RBF). An average accuracy of 74. 2 % was obtained when using the proposed method on a dataset collected, prior to this study, from 12 healthy individuals. This accuracy was higher than that obtained when other widely used methods, such as common spatial patterns (CSP), filter bank CSP (FBCSP), and band power methods, were used on the same dataset. These results are encouraging and the proposed method could potentially be used in future applications including BCI-driven robotic devices, such as a portable exoskeleton for the arm, to assist individuals with impaired upper extremity functions in performing daily tasks...|$|E
