A good amount of research has been done to exploit the different services that can be provided to enhance the safety and comfort of the driver. Additional functions provide the car electronics and the passengers with access to the Internet and <b>other</b> <b>core</b> <b>network</b> resources. This paper provides a survey of the latest advances in the area of inter-vehicular communication (IVC) including vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V 2 I) functions and services. In addition, the paper presents the most important projects and protocols that are involved in IVC systems as well as the different issues and challenges that exist at each layer of the networking model...|$|E

The term access involves a subscriber access to some other network such as the Internet, a private network, a telephony network or any <b>other</b> <b>core</b> <b>network.</b> A typical access system is constituted of: # A subscriber network: It does not necessary constitute of a single user.

For example, Ethernet or token ring types of local area networks (LANs) or xDSL equipment may use an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) backbone to <b>other</b> <b>core</b> <b>networks.</b> ATM networks send data in cells and use connection-oriented virtual circuits. An IP network is packet oriented; so if ATM {{is used as a}} core, packets must be encapsulated in cells and the destination address must be converted to a virtual circuit identifier.

The Gateway is thus responsible for managing a separate MR-UDP connection with each of these nodes, forwarding any application-specific message or context information into the <b>core</b> <b>network</b> and, in the opposite direction, converting DDS messages to MR-UDP messages and delivering them reliably to the corresponding mobile node(s). Being the handler of connections to the mobile nodes (MNs), the Gateway is also responsible for notifying <b>other</b> SDDL <b>core</b> <b>network</b> nodes when a new MN becomes available or when MNs disconnect from it.

40|$|Wireless {{communication}} {{technologies have}} emerged vehicular {{networks in the}} forms of Intra-Vehicle (InV), Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V 2 V) and Vehicle-to- Infrastructure (V 2 I) communications. These technologies enable a variety of applications for driver and passenger needs, such as safety, convenience and entertainment facilities incorporated into modern automobile designs. The researchers exploit the different services that will enable to exchange useful information with-inside and with-outside vehicle via vehicular networks. Vehicles exchange information about their state, view of current road, navigation information and other general information about weather report and digital map update. A key for exchanging information in timely manner {{is an opportunity to}} access the medium for longer life with low power consumption in various ranges.

40|$|Abstract- Modern {{telecommunication}} networks and classical roles of operators {{are subject to}} fundamental change. On the one hand many network operators are currently seeking for new sources to generate revenue by exposing network capabilities to 3 rd party service providers, on the <b>other</b> hand <b>core</b> <b>network</b> technologies have been re-defined under the label of NGN and the transition from existing legacy infrastructures towards NGN is ongoing.

This report describes our approach to setup an infrastructure to explore and prototype technologies for a Service Delivery Framework based on Service Oriented Architecture principles that allows the autonomous composition of services.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} problem of distributing a file {{initially}} located at a server among a set of peers. Peers who downloaded the file can upload it to other peers. The server and the peers are connected to each <b>other</b> via a <b>core</b> <b>network.</b> The upload and download rates {{to and from the}} core are constrained by user and server specific upload and download capacities. Our objective is to minimize the makespan. We derive exact polynomial time algorithms for the case when upload and download capacities per peer and among peers are equal. We show that the problem becomes strongly NP-hard for equal upload and download capacities per peer that may differ among peers. For this case we devise a polynomial time (1 + 2 √ 2) -approximation algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, neither NP-hardness nor approximation algorithms were known before for this problem. ...|$|R
40|$|While {{invaluable}} {{for many}} computer vision applications, decomposing a natural image into intrinsic reflectance and shading layers represents a challenging, underdetermined inverse problem. As opposed to strict reliance on conventional optimization or filtering solutions with strong prior assumptions, deep learning-based approaches {{have also been}} proposed to compute intrinsic image decompositions when granted access to sufficient labeled training data. The downside is that current data sources are quite limited, and broadly speaking {{fall into one of}} two categories: either dense fully-labeled images in synthetic/narrow settings, or weakly-labeled data from relatively diverse natural scenes. In contrast to many previous learning-based approaches, which are often tailored to the structure of a particular dataset (and may not work well on <b>others),</b> we adopt <b>core</b> <b>network</b> structures that universally reflect loose prior knowledge regarding the intrinsic image formation process and can be largely shared across datasets. We then apply flexibly supervised loss layers that are customized for each source of ground truth labels. The resulting deep architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on all of the major intrinsic image benchmarks, and runs considerably faster than most at test time...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} a method and tool for emulation of the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) <b>core</b> <b>network</b> needed as an environment to test the routing functionality. GPRS is the most widely adopted mobile packet data delivery technology in the world. It utilizes an Intranet Protocol (IP) -based <b>core</b> <b>network</b> and involves significant changes {{to the way the}} Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) air interface is structured. It also forms the basis of the future structure of mobile network transmission and switching. The Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) is the most fundamental node in GPRS. Ericsson produces and manages an increasing number of SGSN nodes in the world. One of main functionalities of SGSN node is to forward IP packets according to the destination address in the IP header on IP <b>core</b> <b>network.</b> In each new release of SGSN, or when implementation or upgrades have been done on routing application on SGSN, design and test engineers at Ericsson need to emulate the IP <b>core</b> <b>network.</b> This must be done with use of many routers to generate huge amounts of data that can simulate the real world IP <b>core</b> <b>network.</b> The major goal of this thesis was to analyze and verifying the use of a suitable and economical solution to emulating IP <b>Core</b> <b>Network</b> of the GPRS system for testing of different functionality of the routing application running in SGSN, instead of building up a physical <b>Core</b> <b>Network</b> with different infrastructure and many routers. The method chosen for emulating the IP <b>core</b> <b>network</b> with many routers, and investigated in the thesis, is based on a Cisco simulator called “Dynamips”, which runs many actual Cisco Internetwork Operating Systems (IOS) with many different models of Cisco products in a virtual environment on Windows or Linux platforms.

A conclusion of this work is that Dynamips could be used to emulate many complicated IP <b>core</b> <b>network</b> scenarios, with many routers to generate huge amounts of data to simulate the real world IP <b>core</b> <b>network.</b> The emulated system fulfils its purpose for testing of the routing application of SGSN regarding different functionality and characteristics. This is done to ensure and verify that SGSN routing application meets its functional and technical requirements, and also helps to find undiscovered errors as well as helps to ensure that the individual components of routing application on SGSN are working correctly...|$|R
