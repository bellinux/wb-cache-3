50|$|The term Haskalah became synonymous, {{among friends}} and foes alike and {{in much of}} early Jewish historiography, with the {{sweeping}} changes that engulfed Jewish society (mostly in Europe) from the late 18th Century to the late 19th Century. It was depicted by its partisans, adversaries and historians like Heinrich Graetz as {{a major factor in}} those. Later research greatly narrowed the scope of the phenomenon and limited its importance: while Hasklaha undoubtedly played a part, the contemporary historical consensus portrays it as much humbler. <b>Other</b> <b>transformation</b> agents, from state-imposed schools to new economic opportunities, were demonstrated to have rivaled or overshadowed the movement completely in propelling such processes as acculturation, secularization, religious reform from moderate to extreme, adoption of native patriotism and so forth.

Integrals weighted with the multivariate normal density are usually transformed to the unit cube with the inverse of the multivariate normal cumulative distribution function. However, <b>other</b> <b>transformations</b> are possible, amongst which the transformation by Box and Muller. The danger in using a non-separable transformation is that it might break the low discrepancy structure which makes quasi-Monte Carlo converge faster than regular Monte Carlo.

The music video is also reminiscent of sentai films. In the video, the girls use transformation belts to become helmeted fighters looking like sentai warriors, and the Weekend Heroines squadron fights fully armed with a song and a dance.
