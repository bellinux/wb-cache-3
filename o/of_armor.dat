5|$|The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover are two 1910 American silent short comedies {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Both films were originally released together on a single reel and are two distinct and separate subjects. The Girls He Left Behind Him focuses on a young man, Jack Redfern, who receives a letter from an old sweetheart of his. This prompts him to reminiscence about all the girls he has had affections for {{on the eve of}} his wedding. All the old sweethearts of his life then appear at his wedding to wish him well. The Iron Clad Lover concerns two suitors who are vying for the affections of Bessie. Tom, who plays a game of chess with her father, ends up quarreling with him and he is thrown out of the house. The next day, Tom attempts to bring flowers and candy for Bessie's birthday, but is dismissed by the angry father. Tom decides to dress up in a suit <b>of</b> <b>armor</b> and ends up breaking a vase when trying to announce himself. The suit <b>of</b> <b>armor</b> is thrown out and Bessie and the other suitor chase down the junk dealer to free Tom from the suit <b>of</b> <b>armor.</b> Both films were released on December 9, 1910 and were met with positive reviews by The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|When the Civil War {{broke out}} in 1861, Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen R. Mallory was an early enthusiast for the {{advantages}} <b>of</b> <b>armor.</b> As he looked upon it, the Confederacy could not match the industrial North in numbers of ships at sea, so {{they would have to}} compete by building vessels that individually outclassed those of the Union. Armor would provide the edge. Mallory gathered about himself a group of men who could put his vision into practice, among them John M. Brooke, John L. Porter, and William P. Williamson.|$|E

5|$|Abdül Kadir was {{the first}} Ottoman pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} to be constructed. She was laid down in 1892 {{at the beginning of}} a small-scale expansion of the Ottoman Navy. Work slowed down considerably once she was framed. By the early 1900s the only progress that had been made was the addition <b>of</b> <b>armor</b> plating around her keel. Once that was finished, work ceased. Construction was planned to resume in 1904 but by that time her keel blocks, which were used to prevent hogging and sagging, had shifted and the ship was considered a total loss. She was scrapped on the slipway in 1914. A model of this ship exists in the Constantinople Naval Museum.|$|E
5|$|Alphonse {{is one of}} {{the protagonists}} from the series {{alongside}} his older brother Edward. Alphonse loses his entire body while he and Edward are trying to revive his mother Trisha using alchemy. Edward sacrifices his right arm to seal Alphonse's soul into a suit <b>of</b> <b>armor.</b> Edward later becomes an alchemist from the state military of Amestris, and starts traveling with Alphonse to search for a method to recover Alphonse's body. They seek the Philosopher's Stone, which would allow them to restore their physical forms. Besides being a powerful alchemist, Alphonse is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter; having been trained by Izumi Curtis. While Alphonse cannot feel anything because he has no body, he is nearly invincible as long as the blood mark made by Edward on his armor to contain his soul is not defaced.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{that was being}} considered was that <b>of</b> <b>armor.</b> Mallory was here somewhat ahead of his time, enthusiastically supporting iron cladding for ships before the fledgling metals industry in the country could supply it in the requisite quantities.

He spoke up for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended for the defense of New York Harbor; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L. Stevens, it had been laid down in 1842 but was still incomplete in 1853, when Mallory gave his argument. His pleading was unsuccessful in that the Senate did not agree to continue funding the project, but in his supporting speech he expressed some of the principles that guided his thinking when he later became the Confederate Secretary of the Navy.|$|E

50|$|War hammers were {{developed}} {{as a consequence of}} the prevalence of surface-hardened steel surfacing <b>of</b> wrought iron <b>armors</b> <b>of</b> the late medieval battlefields during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The surface <b>of</b> <b>armors</b> had become as hard as the edge of a blade, so blades tended to ricochet.

A war hammer could deliver the full force of a blow to the target.|$|R
5|$|At 13.5degrees of elevation, the 30.5cm gun {{could hit}} targets out to 16,200m (17,717yards) with armor-piercing shells. After the turrets were {{improved}} to allow elevation to 16degrees, the range correspondingly increased to 20,400m (22,310yd). At {{a range of}} 12,800m (14,000yd), the L3 armor-piercing shells fired by the gun were expected to penetrate 254mm (10in) <b>of</b> <b>armor</b> plate.

The range of the World War II guns was significantly greater than the guns used in World War I. With the 405kg shell at 45degrees, the guns had a maximum range of 32,000m (35,000yd). With the 415kg shell at 49.2degrees, the range was 41,300m (45,166yd), and with the lighter 250kg round at 49.1degrees, the maximum range was 51,400m (56,200yd).|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the ships}} was {{authorized}} on 30 June 1890 and the contract for Indiana—not including guns and armor—was awarded to William Cramp & Sons in Philadelphia, who offered to build it for $3,020,000.

The contract specified the ship had to be built in three years, but slow delivery <b>of</b> <b>armor</b> plates caused a two-year delay. Indianas keel was laid down on 7 May 1891 and she was launched on 28 February 1893, attended by around 10,000 people, including President Benjamin Harrison, several members of his cabinet and the two senators from Indiana. During her fitting-out in early March 1894, the ship undertook a preliminary sea trial to test her speed and machinery. At this point her side armor, guns, turrets and conning tower had not yet been fitted, and her official trials would not take place until October 1895 due to the delays in armor deliveries.|$|E

5000|$|W. Edward Mann called {{attention}} to the body’s visible displays <b>of</b> character <b>armor</b> such as muscular tension and stated that armoring was the character structure in its physical form. He explained that if one could break down the armoring one would be able to change the neurotic character structure. Researchers now understand these displays as physical defenses; the body reacts in certain ways to defend the person against the expression of undesirable emotion. Mann explains the build-up <b>of</b> <b>armoring</b> as the build-up <b>of</b> <b>armoring</b> as the body's physical response to create blocks for natural biological movements such as curiosity, play, sex, exploration, or defiance of authority. [...] Reich’s writings imply that there are no benefits in armoring, a belief that most modern-day experts do not accept. Essentially, the technique meant that to properly treat the problem, the therapist must break down the body’s defenses to allow repressed emotion to come out.|$|R

5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Alphonse's soul was sealed in a flying squirrel instead <b>of</b> <b>armor</b> {{as a result}} of human transmutation. He appeared as the father to the other protagonist, Edward, in their searching for a way to recover their bodies. To match the designs from the manga magazine Monthly Shōnen Gangan, the two characters were redesigned. Alphonse was given a huge suit <b>of</b> <b>armor</b> to contrast him with Edward's short stature. Since Alphonse mostly appears with his armor, Arakawa tends to make sketches of his human form so that she would not forget how to draw him. Some events from the Elrics' lives are social problems she integrated into the plot. Their journey across the country to help people is meant to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. As Alphonse is mostly seen with his armor, during various chapters from the manga Arakawa was unable to draw him crying. During Chapter 40, Arakawa saw his conversation with Edward as a way to let him express his feeling and to make him appear as though he is crying. When comparing the two brothers during the time Alphonse obtained the ability to use alchemy without a circle like Edward, Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences {{in the same way as}} other alchemists appearing in the series. When making omakes, Arakawa tends to draw Alphonse doing something comical to contrast him with the other characters. She states that she does it because Alphonse may enjoy making fun of other people.|$|E
