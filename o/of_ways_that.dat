5|$|The Barnes Review edition was {{subsequently}} translated into Japanese in 2004 {{by a pair}} of Japanese translators, Hideo Tanaka and Kenkichi Sakita, and became an instant success, selling out 10 successive re-printings before 2007 when it was reissued as a mass market paperback. Gregory Clark noted that the Japanese edition <b>of</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>That</b> Are Dark, which was entitled Ankoku Tairiku Chūgoku no Shinjitsu ("The Truth About the Dark Continent China"), had garnered widespread popularity among members of the Japanese right-wing.|$|E
5|$|Deus Exs {{gameplay}} combines {{elements of}} the first-person shooter with stealth elements, adventure, and role-playing genres, allowing for its tasks and missions {{to be completed in}} a variety <b>of</b> <b>ways,</b> <b>that</b> in turn lead to differing outcomes. Presented from the first-person perspective, the player can customize Denton's various abilities such as weapon skills or lockpicking, increasing his effectiveness in these areas; this opens up different avenues of exploration and methods of interacting with or manipulating other characters. The player is able to complete side missions away from the primary storyline by moving freely around the available areas, which can reward the player with experience points to upgrade abilities and alternative ways to tackle main missions.|$|E

25|$|Inspired by {{his work}} with ancient hieroglyphic writing systems, he envisioned a {{communication}} program in which a group of ideas could be represented by one single picture. The specific idea that the user wished to convey would {{be determined by the}} context or sequence in which the picture was used. As a result, he began developing a computer system using inputs from multi-meaning pictures in a variety <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> would allow the user access to a wide array of language. These multi-meaning pictures would maximize the user’s current communication abilities and facilitate information exchange in an economical way.|$|E
25|$|Rawson et al. {{determined}} that if five teeth marks can be matched to five teeth, {{it can be}} said with confidence that only one person could have caused the bite, and if eight teeth were matched to marks this would be a certainty. However, in this study the probabilities used to make this claim are {{based on the assumption that}} the position of each tooth was independent of all the others. This is probably unrealistic because there are a number <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> the dental profile can be changed. For example, braces apply force to specific teeth, in order to shift the placement of multiple teeth.|$|E

25|$|Popper {{regarded}} {{theories that}} have survived criticism as better corroborated {{in proportion to}} the amount and stringency of the criticism, but, {{in sharp contrast to the}} inductivist theories of knowledge, emphatically as less likely to be true. Popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge. Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable and so there are lots <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> they could turn out to be wrong), but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated).|$|E
25|$|Fog {{begins to}} form when water vapor {{condenses}} into tiny liquid water droplets {{suspended in the}} air. Six examples <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> water vapor {{is added to the}} air are by wind convergence into areas of upward motion; precipitation or virga falling from above; daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies, or wet land; transpiration from plants; cool or dry air moving over warmer water; and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Fog, like its elevated cousin stratus, is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass.|$|E
25|$|Xochimilco Ecological Park and Plant Market is {{a natural}} reserve or park, with a thirteenhectare plant market, the largest in Latin America. The park and market {{are located in the}} {{southern}} Mexico City borough of Xochimilco, about 23km south of the historic center of the city. The park was inaugurated in 1993, on chinampas (artificial lake islands) which had been previously declared as part of a World Heritage site. However, the area’s ecology was badly degraded, and the park was established in order to revitalize and preserve the ecosystem. Success has been mixed. While much of the wetlands have been recharged, pollution and illegal settlements in the area remain as threats. As the park needs to be self-sustaining economically, there are a number <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> the park raises money. One of the best known of these is the Xochimilco or Cuemanco Plant Market, which rents stalls to ornamental plant producers/sellers near the main entrance of the park.|$|E

500|$|A {{hypothetical}} randomly evolved {{genetic code}} further motivates a biochemical or evolutionary model for its origin. If amino acids {{were randomly assigned}} to triplet codons, there would be 1.5×1084 possible genetic codes. This number is found by calculating the number <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> [...] 21 items (20 amino acids plus one stop) can be placed in 64 bins, wherein each item is used at least once. However, the distribution of codon assignments in the genetic code is nonrandom. In particular, the genetic code clusters certain amino acid assignments.|$|E
500|$|Research psychologists Kassin and Wrightsman {{indicate}} that the model employed (demographic factors predict attitudes that predict verdicts) has empirical weaknesses. That attitudes predict verdicts is taken for granted and rarely studied. For example, veterans might favor current troops, {{but that does not}} necessarily translate into a likelihood to acquit their brethren of crimes. However, the relationship between demographics and verdicts can be more reliably predicted by mock trials. Successful prediction of jury verdicts often requires data specific to the case and jurisdiction. The sheer number <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> one case can be unique outstrips the published research on the subject, so original research is often required. That necessity is exacerbated by the fact that many modern consultants are reluctant to share knowledge, even with other firms, because of paranoia, client confidentiality, and their regard for their work as [...] "trade secrets".|$|E

500|$|Following the {{nomination}} of [...] "World Enough and Time" [...] at the Nebula Awards, there was criticism of {{the inclusion of a}} fan production. Keith DeCandido, writer of Star Trek tie-in novels, wrote on his blog [...] "Look, this isn't a knock on the fan films as such. But that's what they are – they're fan films. They are not professionally produced. What's more, they're unauthorized and, by the letter of the law, illegal. In fact, {{one of the reasons why}} they're not prosecuted, is because they don't turn a profit, which is one of the legion <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> they're not professionally produced". In response, Zicree replied with a statement to the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, explaining that the episode was produced with the full knowledge of Paramount Pictures and CBS. He explained the involvement of Abrams, and the use of the Universal lot for filming as well as commenting on the crewmembers who were paid at industry standard rates. He later explained that executives at CBS Video wanted to licence [...] "World Enough and Time" [...] and include it on a Star Trek Blu-ray but they could not convince the chief executive.|$|E
500|$|Townsend {{is still}} held in esteem by {{many members of}} the extreme right in the United States, and {{recently}} in Japan as well. After his death his widow Janet turned over his papers to Larry Humphreys, an Oklahoma multimillionaire and supporter of right-wing militia and Christian Identity groups, who referred to Townsend as a man who [...] "knew FDR was trying to entice Japan into attacking the United States, and FDR had him jailed". Humphreys stored Townsend's papers in his so-called [...] "Heritage Library", though today many of them are held by Barnes Review, an anti-Semitic organization under the leadership of Townsend's old friend Willis Carto. In 1997, Barnes Review re-published Ways That Are Dark: The Truth About China {{for the first time since}} World War II with a new foreword written by Carto, who praised Townsend as [...] "a profound, genuinely courageous and painfully honest writer". In 2004 a Japanese translation of the Barnes Review edition <b>of</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>That</b> Are Dark was released in Japan where it became a runaway success and quickly elevated Townsend to [...] "hero" [...] status among the Japanese far right.|$|E
500|$|Having {{outlined}} his methodological approach, Cochrane goes on {{to apply}} his theory to a number <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> animals are used by society. First, Cochrane considers animal experimentation, arguing that [...] "animal experiments that result in pain or death are morally illegitimate, while painless experiments in which the animal does not die are permissible, all else being equal." [...] Cochrane discusses how to judge the strength of an interest, and then considers the strength of animals' interests in not being subjected to painful experimentation. He considers three reasons the interest may {{not be sufficient to}} ground a right, and rejects them all; that the benefits of animal testing outweigh the suffering, that humans owe more to members of their own species than to members of others (see speciesism) and that human lives are objectively more valuable than the lives of other animals. Cochrane concludes that animals have a concrete right to not be subjected to painful experiments. He next considers animals' interests in not being killed, concluding that they [...] "have an interest in continued life so that they may have more pleasant experiences and greater overall well-being in their lives", but that this interest is weaker than the corresponding interest possessed by human persons. If deadly experimentation on nonhuman non-persons is permitted, then consistency demands that it also be permitted on human non-persons, such as babies or individuals with certain cognitive disabilities. Like most others, Cochrane is unwilling to allow this possibility, and so claims that animals have a right not to be used in deadly experiments. However, he argues that animals have neither an interest in negative or positive freedom, and, like animals, human non-persons also lack this interest; therefore, neither have a prima facie right not to be used, provided said use respects the rights they do possess.|$|E
