5|$|Another species {{analysed}} in Gulden's 2001 study, Galerina pseudomycenopsis, {{also could}} not be distinguished from G.marginata based on ribosomal DNA sequences and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analyses. Because <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> ecology, fruit body color and spore size combined with inadequate sampling, the authors preferred to maintain G.pseudomycenopsis as a distinct species. A 2005 study again failed to separate the two species using molecular methods, but reported that the incompatibility demonstrated in mating experiments suggests that the species are distinct.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{more quickly than}} the ocean because <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> their {{specific}} heat values.

5|$|Bellona {{opened fire}} on Corageux while Brilliant engaged Maliceuse and Hermione. Through {{skillful}} sailing, Logie {{was able to keep}} both French frigates at bay and unable to assist Courageux, which surrendered to Bellona after ninety minutes of fighting. At 7.30 a.m. Maliceuse and Hermione made sail and retreated, with Brilliant too damaged to give chase. British losses in the battle numbered six killed and 28 wounded on Bellona and five killed and 16 wounded on Brilliant. On the French side, losses on Courageux alone were 240 killed and 110 wounded. Historian William Laird Clowes has suggested that the much higher French casualty rate was the result <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> tactics, with the French gun crews trained to fire at the masts and rigging of an enemy ship in order to disable them ahead of a boarding attempt. By contrast, British crews were trained to fire into the hulls of enemy ships.|$|E
5|$|Brown bears {{typically}} dominate wolf packs in {{disputes over}} carcasses, while wolf packs mostly prevail against bears when defending their den sites. Both species kill each other's young. Wolves eat the brown bears they kill, while brown bears seem to only eat young wolves. Wolf interactions with American black bears are much rarer than with brown bears, because <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> habitat preferences. The majority of black bear encounters with wolves {{occur in the}} species' northern range, with no interactions being recorded in Mexico. Wolves have been recorded on numerous occasions to actively seek out black bears in their dens and kill them without eating them. Unlike brown bears, black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills. While encounters with brown and black bears appear to be common, polar bears are rarely encountered by wolves, though there are two records of wolf packs killing polar bear cubs. Wolves also kill the cubs of Asian black bears.|$|E

5|$|Carpenter was not {{the first}} person asked to oversee the comic; Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-off comic, was {{originally}} intended {{to be in charge of}} the bimonthly series. Verheiden's commitment to the TV series kept him from working on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter if he would take them on. Although the comic-book series was intended to expand on the TV series, there was an occasional continuity overlap because <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> production schedule between the comic and the series. In one instance, the comic book showed Clark robbing an ATM and the season-three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs. The comic-book series tied into the TV series, the Chloe Chronicles webisodes and Smallville-related webpages, with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes' production. The comic-book series ended in January 2005, with no comics published until the Season Eleven series debut.|$|E
5|$|Different {{subspecies}} of plains zebra were recognised {{as members}} of Equus quagga by early researchers, though there was much confusion over which species were valid. Quagga subspecies were described on the basis <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to individual variation within the same populations. Some subspecies and even species, such as E. q. danielli and Hippotigris isabellinus, were only based on illustrations (iconotypes) of aberrant quagga specimens. Some authors have described the quagga {{as a kind of}} wild horse rather than a zebra, and one craniometric study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the horse (Equus caballus). It has been pointed out that early morphological studies were erroneous; using skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used donkey and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable.|$|E
5|$|Modern plant breeders {{develop new}} crop {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions. A new variety might, for example, be higher yielding, more disease resistant {{or have a}} longer shelf life than the varieties from which it was bred. The practical use of crop diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of crop rotation and fallow fields, where planting and harvesting one type of crop on a plot of land one year, and planting a different crop on that same plot the next year. This takes advantage <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> a plant's nutrient needs, but more importantly reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E

5|$|Peasants {{and their}} {{supporters}} advocated the notion that each family was supposed to receive at least four hectares of land; in their system, which made note <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> local traditional, peasants living in wetlands were to be assigned 16 pogoane (approx. eight hectares), those living in plains 14 (approx. seven hectares), inhabitants of hilly areas 11 (between five and six hectares), while people inhabiting the Southern Carpathian areas were supposed to receive eight pogoane (approx. four hectares). This program was instantly rejected by many landowners, and the negotiations were ended through a decision taken by Heliade Rădulescu, when it was again decided that the ultimate resolution was a prerogative of the future Assembly. The failure to address this most significant of the problems faced by Wallachians contributed to weakening support for the revolutionary cause.|$|E
5|$|RIRP {{rests on}} several assumptions, {{including}} efficient markets, no country risk premia, and zero {{change in the}} expected real exchange rate. The parity condition suggests that real interest rates will equalize between countries and that capital mobility will result in capital flows that eliminate opportunities for arbitrage. There exists strong evidence that RIRP holds tightly among emerging markets in Asia and also Japan. The half-life period of deviations from RIRP have been examined by researchers and found to be roughly six or seven months, but between two and three months for certain countries. Such variation in the half-lives of deviations may be reflective <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the degree of financial integration among the country groups analyzed. RIRP does not hold over short time horizons, but empirical evidence has demonstrated that it generally holds well across long time horizons of five to ten years.|$|E
5|$|Thamnophilidae {{was removed}} from Formicariidae, leaving behind the antthrushes and antpittas, due to {{recognition}} <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> {{the structure of the}} breastbone (sternum) and syrinx, and Sibley and Ahlquist's examination of DNA–DNA hybridization. The Thamnophilidae antbirds are members of the infraorder Tyrannides (or tracheophone suboscines), one of two infraorders in the suborder Tyranni. The Thamnophilidae are now thought to occupy a fairly basal position within the infraorder, i. e. with regard to their relatives the antthrushes and antpittas, tapaculos, gnateaters, and also the ovenbirds. The sister group of the Thamnophilidae is thought to be the gnateaters. The ovenbirds, tapaculos, antthrushes and antpittas are thought to represent a different radiation of that early split.|$|E

5|$|The {{capybara}} and {{the lesser}} capybara {{belong to the}} subfamily Hydrochoerinae along with the rock cavies. The living capybaras and their extinct relatives were previously classified in their own family Hydrochoeridae. Since 2002, molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between Hydrochoerus and Kerodon, the rock cavies, supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of Caviidae. Paleontological classifications have yet to incorporate this new taxonomy and continue to use Hydrochoeridae for all capybaras, while using Hydrochoerinae for the living genus and its closest fossil relatives, such as Neochoerus. The taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also {{in a state of}} flux. In recent years, the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced. This is largely due to the recognition that capybara molar teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an individual. In one instance, material once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species, Cardiatherium paranense.|$|E
5|$|The {{regional}} specialties {{that are}} a feature of early modern and contemporary cuisine were not in evidence in the sparser documentation that survives. Instead, medieval cuisine can be differentiated by the cereals and the oils that shaped dietary norms and crossed ethnic and, later, national boundaries. Geographical variation in eating was primarily the result <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> climate, political administration, and local customs that varied across the continent. Though sweeping generalizations should be avoided, more or less distinct areas where certain foodstuffs dominated can be discerned. In the British Isles, northern France, the Low Countries, the northern German-speaking areas, Scandinavia and the Baltic, the climate was generally too harsh for the cultivation of grapes and olives. In the south, wine was the common drink for both rich and poor alike (though the commoner usually {{had to settle for}} cheap second pressing wine) while beer was the commoner's drink in the north and wine an expensive import. Citrus fruits (though not the kinds most common today) and pomegranates were common around the Mediterranean. Dried figs and dates were available in the north, but were used rather sparingly in cooking.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} as new to science by American mycologists Rolf Singer and Alexander H. Smith, based on specimens collected in Nor Yungas Province, Bolivia, {{on the road to}} La Paz to Coroico. They published a short description in Latin in a 1958 Mycologia publication, followed by a more detailed description in English later that year. According to Psilocybe specialist Gastón Guzmán, the species Psilocybe acutissima (described by Roger Heim in 1958), and Psilocybe isauri (described by Singer in 1959) are synonyms, as both the macroscopic and microscopic features are the same in the type material of all three. Singer considered P.isauri a species distinct from P.yungensis because <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the hairiness of the stem surface. Smith named the variety P.yungensis var. diconica for specimens he found with conical, rather than obconical (the form of an inverted cone) papilla. Similarly, the main distinguishing feature that Heim ascribed to P.acutissima was a papillate cap (somewhat resembling the shape of a female human breast). Later studies showed that these morphological variations did not warrant individual recognition, because of the variable nature of these characteristics, and the existence of intermediate forms.|$|E
