40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel two-step approach for {{the fundamental problem}} of learning an optimal map from one distribution to another. First, we learn an optimal transport (OT) plan, which can be thought as a <b>one-to-many</b> <b>map</b> between the two distributions. To that end, we propose a stochastic dual approach of regularized OT, and show empirically that it scales better than a recent related approach when the amount of samples is very large. Second, we estimate a Monge map as a deep neural network learned by approximating the barycentric projection of the previously-obtained OT plan. We prove two theoretical stability results of regularized OT which show that our estimations converge to the OT plan and Monge map between the underlying continuous measures. We showcase our proposed approach on two applications: domain adaptation and generative modeling. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} general method of associating next-to-leading order weights to leading order phase space {{configurations}} at hadron colliders.

As a result virtual and real singularities cancel at each Born phase space point. The new phase space maps {{can be used in a}} traditional approach for NLO calculations. However, interesting applications arise when one instead integrates out the real radiation up to a specified scale. This allows one to define NLO weights for individual phase space points that are present at LO. This method allows for the extension of matrix element methods to next-to-leading order, even in the presence of jets.

The IdMappingRetrieval package allows initial acquisition of biological identifier mappings (ID maps) from online bioinformatics services, with caching in localdata repositories for subsequent fast retrieval.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a one-to-many reversible mapping mechanism simulation for IPv 6 address generation. The aim of this mechanism is to improve IPv 6 addresses generation in terms of privacy and security in an enterprise local area network (LAN). Each time a user accesses a network, a dynamic IPv 6 address is assigned via the DHCPv 6 server. The dynamic address (<b>one-to-many</b> <b>mapping)</b> is to protect a user from unwanted behavior analysis attempting to exploit IPv 6 addresses, thus protecting user privacy. However, the dynamic address can be uniquely linked to the user (many-to-one mapping) if the need arises. The one-to-many reversible mapping is generated dynamically using Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode of operation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Software simulation is developed using the software engineering waterfall model and a Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram as a notation. The results show that the mechanism simulates well for IPv 6 address generation and IPv 6 address owner identification. The <b>one-to-many</b> <b>mapping</b> may be incorporated into DHCPv 6 software and many-toone mapping may be implemented as a complement of local area network monitoring software...|$|E
40|$|Abstract An {{investigation}} of the applicability of neural network-based methods in predicting the values of multiple parameters, given {{the value of a}} single parameter within a particular problem domain is presented. In this context, the input parameter may be an important source of variation that is related with a complex mapping function to the remaining sources of variation within a multivariate distribution. The definition {{of the relationship between the}} variables of a multivariate distribution and a single source of variation allows the estimation of the values of multiple variables given the value of the single variable, addressing in that way an ill-conditioned <b>one-to-many</b> <b>mapping</b> problem. As part of our investigation, two problem domains are considered: predicting the values of individual stock shares, given the value of the general index, and predicting the grades received by high school pupils, given the grade for a single course or the average grade. With our work, the performance of standard neural network-based methods and in particular multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), radial basis functions (RBFs), mixture density networks (MDNs) and a latent variable method, the general topographic mapping (GTM), is compared.

Category B is a <b>one-to-many</b> semantic <b>mapping</b> between English and Thai prepositions.

The conversion between traditional and simplified Chinese is usually problematic, because the simplification of some traditional forms merged two or more different characters into one simplified form. The traditional to simplified (many-to-one) conversion is technically simple. The opposite conversion often results in a data loss when converting to GB 2312: in <b>mapping</b> <b>one-to-many</b> when assigning traditional glyphs to the simplified glyphs, some characters will inevitably be the wrong choices {{in some of the}} usages.

40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{widespread}} use of relational databases (mySQL, Oracle, DB 2, MsSQL), most data are stored as multiple tables in what can be a very large database. As a result, more efficient algorithms for mining data from multirelational domain need to be implemented. Inductive Logic programming (ILP) techniques are useful for analyzing data in multi-relational databases. Unfortunately, even though not complex in structure, such business data are often large and contain highly non-determinate components, making them difficult for ILP learners geared towards structurally complex tasks.

40|$|A novel {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} {{for the analysis of}} primate social groups. Fuzzy set theory can provide quantitative information about the social dependence of one individual on another, in relation to the entire group. Instead of mapping one-to-one relationships, this procedure <b>maps</b> <b>one-to-many</b> relations. Whereas classical set theory is limited to crisp set membership (membership of x in set A = 0 or 1), fuzzy set theory allows degrees of membership (membership of x in set A = range 0 – 1). The latter is more suitable for analysing primate social interactions because primate social relationships (measured as number of interactions) typically follow a pattern whereupon relationships can be classified within a range of 0 – 1 (depending on number of interactions). Here, fuzzy set theory methods are demonstrated on a large dataset of social grooming interactions amongst captive chimpanzee group at Chester Zoo, UK. Consider the relationship between chimpanzees A and B, in relation to all others in the group (C, D, E, etc.). Sets A and B include those who groom chimpanzee A and B, respectively. Degrees of membership in these sets are assigned according to number of interactions. Several analyses are possible, the most pertinent being that of ‘fuzzy inclusion’. Here, an ‘inclusion co-efficient’ is presented as a very useful method for measuring the extent (as a continuous variable) that one set can be included within another – applicable to situations for measuring general social dependence of one chimpanzee within the social context of another individual (or clusters of individuals) ...|$|R
