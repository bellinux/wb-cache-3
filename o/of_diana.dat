5|$|In the 1990s, republicanism in the United Kingdom grew, {{partly on}} account of {{negative}} publicity associated with the Royal Family (for instance, immediately following the death <b>of</b> <b>Diana,</b> Princess of Wales). However, polls from 2002 to 2007 showed that around 70–80% of the British public supported {{the continuation of the}} monarchy.|$|E
5|$|This may again {{suggest the}} amphitheatre was flooded, as the {{monument}} referred to {{could be an}} altar <b>of</b> <b>Diana,</b> or Pluto, or of Jupiter Latiaris {{that may have been}} present in the centre of the arena, but Pliny the Elder mentions a bridge in connection with the lake of Augustus, suggesting there may have been an island there as well.|$|E
5|$|Diana Marshall is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Jane Badler. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 22 June 2010. Badler had a four-month {{contract with the}} show and she began filming her first scenes in April following a successful audition. Badler revealed that the writers are fans of the 1983 television miniseries V, which she starred in, and wrote the role <b>of</b> <b>Diana</b> with her in mind. They named the character Diana in a homage to the role she played in the show. The character departed on 20 September 2010.|$|E

50|$|The exact cause <b>of</b> <b>Diana’s</b> {{death is}} a matter of dispute. In de Dominici’s account <b>of</b> <b>Diana’s</b> life, he claims her husband murdered her in a jealous rage after a servant girl {{incorrectly}} informed him that Diana {{was having an affair with}} her instructor. However, other scholars claim de Dominici’s account was over-dramatized and that <b>Diana</b> died <b>of</b> illness in 1643.|$|R

5|$|Hiddleston {{was born}} in Westminster, London. He is the son <b>of</b> <b>Diana</b> Patricia (née Servaes) Hiddleston, an arts {{administrator}} and former stage manager, and James Norman Hiddleston, a physical chemist. His father is from Greenock, Scotland and his mother is from Suffolk, England. His younger sister, Emma, is also an actress, whilst his older sister, Sarah, is a journalist in India. Through his mother, he is a great-grandson of Vice Admiral Reginald Servaes, and a great-great-grandson of food producer Sir Edmund Vestey.|$|E
5|$|Much media {{attention}} focused on the airfield when the body <b>of</b> <b>Diana,</b> Princess of Wales, arrived there from Villacoublay airfield, in Paris, France, after her death {{in a car crash}} in the city on 31 August 1997. The Queen's Colour Squadron, then based at neighbouring RAF Uxbridge, acted as the bearer party, while the flight was met by the Prime Minister, the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Lieutenant of Greater London, Secretary of State for Defence, the RAF Northolt station commander and the RAF Chaplain-in-Chief.|$|E
5|$|The {{disappearance}} attracted sustained {{international interest}} and saturation {{coverage in the}} UK reminiscent of the death <b>of</b> <b>Diana</b> in 1997. The McCanns were subjected to intense scrutiny and baseless allegations of involvement in their daughter's death, particularly in the tabloid press and on Twitter. In 2008 they received damages and front-page apologies from Express Newspapers, and in 2011 they testified before the Leveson Inquiry into British press misconduct, lending support to those arguing for tighter press regulation.|$|E
50|$|U.S. {{journalist}} Gerald Posner {{was played}} innocuous extracts from the NSA tapes <b>of</b> <b>Diana's</b> conversations in early 1999.|$|R
50|$|La Galatea is an {{imitation}} <b>of</b> the <b>Diana</b> <b>of</b> Jorge de Montemayor, and shows {{an even greater}} resemblance to Gil Polo's continuation <b>of</b> the <b>Diana.</b> Next to Don Quixote and the Novelas exemplares, his pastoral romance is considered particularly notable because it predicts the poetic direction in which Cervantes would go {{for the rest of}} his career. It possesses little originality, but is highly reminiscent of its models, and particularly <b>of</b> the <b>Diana</b> <b>of</b> Gil Polo.|$|R
50|$|Under the {{instruction}} <b>of</b> Stanzione, <b>Diana</b> painted many works. According to the biographer Bernardo de Dominici, who wrote an account <b>of</b> <b>Diana’s</b> life, she would paint the commissioned work according to Stanzione’s preliminary drawings then Stanzione would retouch {{them before they}} were delivered to the patron.|$|R
5|$|Tomlinson then {{attempted}} to assist Mohamed al-Fayed in his privately funded {{investigation into the}} death <b>of</b> <b>Diana,</b> Princess of Wales and al-Fayed's son Dodi. Tomlinson claimed that MI6 had considered assassinating Slobodan Milošević, the president of Serbia, by staging a car crash using a powerful strobe light to blind the driver. He suggested that Diana and Dodi may {{have been killed by}} MI6 in the same way, although that claim was dismissed at their inquest in 2007. MI6 admitted that plans of that nature had been drafted regarding a different Eastern European official, but that the proposal had been swiftly rejected by management.|$|E
5|$|At her Silver Jubilee in 1977, {{the crowds}} and {{celebrations}} were genuinely enthusiastic, but in the 1980s, public criticism {{of the royal family}} increased, as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth's children came under media scrutiny. Elizabeth's popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public. Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death <b>of</b> <b>Diana,</b> Princess of Wales, though Elizabeth's personal popularity and support for the monarchy rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.|$|E
5|$|In April 1553 Dudley was {{commanded}} by the King to release {{cloth of silver}} and gold and velvet for the marriage of his nephew Lord Guildford to Lady Jane Grey, which was celebrated on 25 May. In June, Jehan de Scheyfve reported that Dudley himself would marry Margaret Clifford, a granddaughter of Mary Tudor, Queen of France, and cousin of Lady Jane, {{and that he would}} be made Lieutenant-Governor of the North. Dudley had even reserved a number of items from the wardrobe at Westminster for the marriage, including jewels, silver and gilt cups, a hair-brush, velvet dog-collars, and a pair of pictures <b>of</b> <b>Diana</b> and Actaeon. However, Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, having named Lady Jane Grey as his heir.|$|E

5|$|In September 2001, Studio Ghibli {{announced}} {{the production of}} two films. The first would become The Cat Returns and the second was an adaptation <b>of</b> <b>Diana</b> Wynne Jones' novel, Howl's Moving Castle. A rumor persists that Miyazaki had an idea to do Howl's Moving Castle {{during a visit to}} Strasbourg Christmas market. Toshio Suzuki, who produced Howl's Moving Castle, stated that Miyazaki was inspired to make the film when he read Jones' novel, and was struck by the image of a castle moving around the countryside. The novel does not explain how the castle moved, and Miyazaki was interested in figuring out how the castle might move, which led to the image of a castle on chicken legs. The complex moving castle changes and rearranges itself several times throughout the movie in response to Howl's eccentricity and the various situations. The basic structure of the castle consists of more than 80 elements including turrets, a wagging tongue, cogwheels and chicken legs, that were rendered as digital objects.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Croghan, NY812 {{traverses}} the Beaver River {{just north}} of the village line. The route and the river continue northward along parallel routings for a brief distance before the two separate near the hamlet of High Falls. While the river curves east toward the hamlet, NY812 presses northward through the rural hamlets of Indian River and Dutton Corners into the town <b>of</b> <b>Diana,</b> where NY812 starts to parallel the west branch of the Oswegatchie River as both continue north through the town. At Tylers Corners, NY812 intersects NY3 and joins the route eastward into Harrisville, where the conjoined routes cross over the Oswegatchie. Northeast of Harrisville in extreme southwestern St. Lawrence County, NY812 breaks from NY3 and heads northwest through Pitcairn (crossing over the Oswegatchie once more in the process).|$|E
5|$|Yagan's skull {{was handed}} over to the Noongar {{delegation}} at a ceremony at Liverpool Town Hall on 31 August 1997. In accepting the skull, Colbung made comments that were interpreted as linking Yagan's death with the death <b>of</b> <b>Diana,</b> Princess of Wales, earlier that day: That is how nature goes... Nature is a carrier of all good things and all bad things. And because the Poms did the wrong thing, they now have to suffer. Colbung's comments prompted a media furore throughout Australia, with newspapers receiving many letters from the public expressing shock and anger at the comments. Colbung later claimed that his comments had been misinterpreted.|$|E

5|$|During the siege, {{with the}} {{supplies}} {{in the city}} running shorter by the day, British troops {{were sent to the}} Boston Harbour to raid farms for supplies. Graves, apparently acting on intelligence that the Colonials might make attempts on the islands, posted guard boats near Noddle's Island. These were longboats that included detachments of Marines. Sources disagree {{as to whether or not}} any regulars or marines were stationed on Noddle's Island to protect the naval supplies. In response, the Colonials began clearing Noddle's Island and Hog Island of anything useful to the British. Graves on his flagship , taking notice of this, signalled for the guard marines to land on Noddle's island and ordered the armed schooner , under the command of his nephew Lieutenant Thomas Graves, to sail up Chelsea Creek to cut off the colonists' route. This contested action resulted in the loss of two British soldiers and the capture and burning <b>of</b> <b>Diana.</b> This setback prompted Graves to move , which had been stationed in the shallow waters between Boston and Charlestown, into deeper waters to the east of Boston, where it would have improved manoeuvrability if fired upon from land. He also belatedly sent a detachment of regulars to secure Noddle's Island; the colonists had long before removed or destroyed anything of value on the island.|$|E
5|$|The French ships took shelter at {{the heavily}} {{fortified}} Iles Saint-Marcouf, sailing {{the following morning}} for the anchorage at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue. For two days the British frigates kept watch, until two ships of the line from the blockade of Cherbourg, HMS Donegal and HMS Revenge, arrived. On 15 November, the British squadron attacked the anchored French ships, which were defended by shore batteries at La Hougue and Tatihou. After four attempts to close with the French the British squadron, under heavy fire, withdrew. During the night, the British commander, Captain Pulteney Malcolm, sent his ship's boats close inshore to attack the French ships with Congreve rockets, a newly issued weapon. None are recorded as landing on target, but by morning both frigates {{had been forced to}} change position, becoming grounded on the shore. The French ships were later refloated, and Malcolm's squadron maintained the blockade until 27 November when Amazone successfully escaped back to Le Havre. The damaged Elisa remained at anchor until 6 December, when an attack by a British bomb vessel forced the frigate to move further inshore, becoming grounded once more. Elisa remained in this position until 23 December, when the boats <b>of</b> <b>Diana</b> entered the anchorage at night and set the beached ship on fire, destroying her.|$|E
