5|$|Once in orbit, Big G {{would have}} docked with space {{stations}} using an Apollo docking probe mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> {{of the cargo}} module, which was in turn mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the re-entry module. The re-entry module itself would have been enlarged to accommodate the larger crew, and the modifications made to the spacecraft for the MOL program would have been incorporated, including the hatch in the heat shield, {{which would have been}} used to provide access to the cargo module. In the event of a launch failure, the launch escape system developed for the Apollo spacecraft would have been used to propel the re-entry module clear of the rocket.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the latest}} {{specimens}} found show partly different osteoderms including scutes on which the keel {{is more like a}} thorn or spike. These specimens also seem to have little horns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> corners of the head, placed on the squamosal bones.|$|E

A print from Bamber's right forefinger was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> end of the barrel, above the stock and pointing across the gun. He said he had used the gun to shoot rabbits. There were three other prints that could not be identified.|$|E

5|$|Although the Persians stood {{their ground}} for a while, they {{eventually}} broke and fled to the palisade. The soldiers of the right wing followed them into the camp, at which point many of the Persian army fled from the camp, except the ethnic Persian troops, who grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers who entered the camp. Finally, the left wing arrived, outflanking the camp and falling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the remaining Persian forces, thereby completing the rout.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{difference}} between Tarbosaurus and its North American relatives was its more rigid mandible (lower jaw). While many theropods, including North American tyrannosaurids, had some degree of flexibility between the bones {{in the rear of}} the mandible and the dentary in the front, Tarbosaurus had a locking mechanism formed from a ridge on the surface of the angular, which articulated with a square process <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the dentary.|$|E
5|$|Both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were {{equipped}} with {{two sets of}} Seetakt radar. One was mounted on the forward gun director, which was located {{on top of the}} bridge. The second radar set was emplaced <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> main battery gun director. The Seetakt sets operated at 368megacycles, initially at 14kW, though the sets were upgraded to operate at 100kW, on the 80cm wavelength.|$|E

50|$|A second Army {{variation}} of about 5,000 pistols consisted of pistols whose serial numbers ranged, intermittently, from about 712,000 to about 745,000. These have an Eagle/655 WaA (Army acceptance) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>rear</b> trigger guard web and the Eagle/N firing proofs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right <b>rear</b> trigger guard web and on front of right slide, {{but have no}} proof mark <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>rear</b> grip tang. <b>The</b> finish <b>on</b> these pistols is also of the first quality.|$|R

5|$|The T-26 mod. 1931 did {{not have}} a radio set. The tank {{commander}} communicated with the driver by speaking tube, which was replaced with a signalling lamp in 1932. The T-26 was equipped with one fire extinguisher, a kit of spare parts tools and accessories (including a tank jack), a canvas stowage, and a tow chain fixed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the hull.|$|E
5|$|The command {{variant of}} the Tiger II was {{designated}} Panzerbefehlswagen Tiger Ausf. B. It had two versions, Sd.Kfz. 267 and Sd.Kfz. 268. These carried only 63 rounds of 8.8cm ammunition to provide room to accommodate the extra radios and equipment, and had additional armour on the engine compartment. The Sd.Kfz. 267 was to have used FuG 8 and FuG 5 radio sets, with the most notable external changes being a two metre long rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a Sternantenne D ("Star antenna D"), mounted on an insulated base (the 105mm Antennenfuß Nr. 1), which was protected by a large armoured cylinder. This equipment was located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> decking in a position originally used for deep-wading equipment. The Sd.Kfz. 268 used FuG 7 and FuG 5 radios with a two-metre rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a 1.4 metre rod antenna mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> deck.|$|E

5|$|The flaps {{are mounted}} by steel sliders and rollers, {{attached}} to brackets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> spar. The trapezoidal ailerons {{are near the}} wingtips. The fuselage of the Su-25 has an ellipsoidal section and is of semi-monocoque, stressed-skin construction, arranged as a longitudinal load-bearing framework of longerons, beams and stringers, with a transverse load-bearing assembly of frames. The one-piece horizontal tailplane {{is attached to the}} load-bearing frame at two mounting points.|$|E
5|$|The mid-engine {{complicated}} {{the design of}} the four-wheel drive system, and an innovative solution was needed to get drive {{from the rear of the}} engine to the front wheels. The chosen design took the front-wheel drive from the central differential <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill drive, before joining an inverted differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.|$|E
5|$|The west front has {{two large}} {{flanking}} three-stage towers. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> outer {{corners of the}} towers are octagonal stair turrets with panels on the belfry stage. Between the towers is a deep entrance arch of six orders with decorative Purbeck Marble colonnettes and enriched mouldings to the arch. The tympanum of the arch contains an empty niche.|$|E
5|$|MacPherson struts {{are used}} in the front suspension, and an unusual three-link De Dion tube/Watt's linkage is used in <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b> Front discs with {{anti-lock}} braking (ABS) and electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) are standard across the range. In common with many other mid- or rear-engined vehicles its fifteen-inch wheels have uneven-sized tires, 145/65 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fronts and wider 175/55 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rears,</b> in an effort to minimise the chances of oversteer caused by the rear-biased weight distribution.|$|R
50|$|The German Army began HSc {{procurement}} with {{an initial}} order for 3,000 pistols in early 1941, beginning with serial number 701,345, and, intermittently, ending about #712,000. These pistols are marked with an Eagle/655 inspection stamp <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>rear</b> trigger guard web, a factory firing proof Eagle/N <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right <b>rear</b> trigger guard web and {{at the front of}} the right slide. Also a small Army Test Proof stamp was stamped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>rear</b> grip tang. Subsequent orders were placed by the Army throughout the war, along with pistols procured by the Police and Kriegsmarine, with almost 24% of the total production of 252,000 pistols going to the commercial market.|$|R

5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a cargo module attached to the back of a modified equipment module. The spacecraft would have approached the station, and docked backwards using a port <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the cargo module. If one of the forward docking configurations had been used for the Gemini itself, the docking would have been controlled remotely from the station, with the Gemini then separating from the cargo module and flying around the station to dock normally on a different port. The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to the cargo module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station {{at the back of the}} cargo module.|$|E
5|$|At {{medium to}} close range, an adult red-throated loon in either {{breeding}} or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain light conditions, {{at certain times}} in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the black-throated loon, but also occasionally the great crested grebe. It shows more white {{on the head and}} neck than does the black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to show more white on the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> flank (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{has also}} {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} new cultural forms. Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example would feature an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.|$|E

5|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} ways {{have been found to}} indicate the presence of a wake depression. The most direct is through the use of surface observations. Prior to the development of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, it was difficult to locate wake lows. With the advent of mesoscale networks, wake lows have become easier to detect. On weather satellite and weather radar imagery, wake lows and heat bursts normally occur <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> side of a precipitation area. However, within larger precipitation areas, they can be located within the area showing a minimum of returns. When using velocity data from a WSR-88D doppler radar, high winds on the back edge of reflectivity data can give away the location of a wake low.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{had taken}} minor damage {{from their own}} muzzle blasts, and Glorious {{required}} five days of repairs. Courageous fired 92 rounds of 15-inch while Glorious fired 57, scoring only the single hit on Pillau between them. They also fired 180 and 213 four-inch shells respectively. Courageouss mine fittings were removed after the battle and both ships received flying-off platforms {{on top of their}} turrets in 1918. A Sopwith Camel was carried <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> turret and a Sopwith 1½ Strutter on the forward turret.|$|E
5|$|Dominating the {{appearance}} of the house from the street is a large verandah-style porch, supported by large stone columns, on the southern-facing front of the house; an enclosed porch, smaller but two stories high and supported by wooden pillars, is located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> portion of the house's east side. Projecting {{from the front of the}} house, above the porch, is a small wing with a gable, semicircular window, and elaborate cornice.
