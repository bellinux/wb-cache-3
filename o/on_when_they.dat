5|$|Due to the {{increasing}} trend of decreased fertility rate, {{there has been an}} increased nuclearization of the family, where families have less immediate relatives to depend on in times of need. Because of this phenomenon, families do not have an extended family to depend <b>on</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> need a caretaker or someone to do domestic work, and must turn to market substitutes or a member of the immediate family doing both domestic and paid work instead.|$|E
5|$|Starting in August 1941, when {{it became}} clear to some in the Propaganda Ministry and the Wehrmacht high command that the war would likely extend into 1942, Goebbels grew {{increasingly}} concerned about the triumphant tone of the communiques. However, a string of spectacular victories in September, especially in the Battle of Kiev, removed any restraint from the texts, making propagandists's work more difficult later <b>on,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had to explain the Wehrmacht's failures to the German public which was rapidly losing confidence in a swift victory.|$|E

25|$|Greenville, Mississippi had {{the most}} Sicilian {{immigrants}} out of other cities in the delta. Most immigrants first settled in New Orleans {{and worked in the}} sugar cane and cotton fields. Later <b>on</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> arrived in the Delta, they began to settle in towns, which enabled them to open up grocery stores, restaurants, and fruit stands. Because they lived in towns, rather than on farms, they had access to higher quality education, which they took advantage of. Because of these opportunities, young Sicilian immigrants were able to grow up and established and enter into the workforce much faster than Central Italian immigrants. Sicilians established strong ties with their homeland after coming to America.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Symonds scored 101 {{and took}} two wickets for 46 {{to be the}} {{difference}} between the sides at Old Trafford.

The Sussex chase looked <b>on</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were 112 for 1 with Matt Prior and Chris Adams at the crease, as they were just waiting for opportunities to up the run-rate, but instead Symonds and England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff ran through them with the ball, and Robin Martin-Jenkins and Ahmed eventually had to consolidate to 214 for 8, losing by 35 runs.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules on}} what a driver can tow are {{different}} depending <b>on</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> passed their driving test.

They must pass the car and trailer driving test to tow anything heavier. If a driver passed their car test before 1 January 1997, they are usually allowed to drive a vehicle and trailer combination up to 8,250kg MAM. They are also allowed to drive a minibus with a trailer over 750kg MAM.|$|E

25|$|Programs {{that include}} English-language {{captions}} during their original broadcast may also include them in repeat broadcasts airing {{outside of the}} network's prime time schedule after the program's original run on the network or, since 2012, {{as part of the}} network's late-night novela repeat block. Some programs (notably the defunct long-running erotic anthology Decisiones ("Decisions"), which the network now airs only in reruns), only include English captions in certain episodes, depending <b>on</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were produced. Programs that use English captions are primarily consist of telenovelas, though a few shows outside the genre (such as the prime time court show Caso Cerrado: Edición Especial) are also transcribed in both languages. Availability of English subtitles is limited to the technical capacity of the local station, cable or satellite provider, or other outlet to disseminate them over the network feed.|$|E
25|$|The dynamic {{interactions}} between Spinal cord and sensory input are ensured by modulating transmission in locomotor pathways in a state- and phase-dependent manner. For instance, proprioceptive inputs from extensors can, during stance, adjust {{the timing and}} amplitude of muscle activities of the limbs to the speed of locomotion but be silenced during the swing phase of the cycle. Similarly, skin afferents participate predominantly in the correction of limb and foot placement during stance on uneven terrain, but skin stimuli can evoke different types of responses depending <b>on</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> occur within the step cycle. It {{is important to note}} that inputs from the hip appear to play a critical role in spinal locomotion. Experiments on spinal animals showed that when one limb is held with the hip flexed, locomotion on that side stops while the other limb continues walking. However, when the stopped limb is extended at the hip joint to a point normally reached at the end of stance during walking, it suddenly flexes and starts walking again provided that the contralateral limb is a position to accept the weight of the hindquarters. Other work confirmed the importance of hip afferents for locomotor rhythm generation since flexion of the hip will abolish the rhythm whereas extension will enhance it.|$|E
