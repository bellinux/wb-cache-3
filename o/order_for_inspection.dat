Corporates functioning in India will have to abide by all statutory requirements {{and it is the}} duty cast on the office of the Registrar of Companies to ensure that all norms are followed and that any violations are brought to books. The RoC has the power to take action against companies that fail to submit requisite documents in time or for production of incorrect/incomplete information. The registered documents are made available to the Shareholders, Investors and the General public at large through an online portal MCA21 at a payment of nominal fee. The RoC also has suo-moto powers to <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> of companies and if deemed necessary, investigation can also be carried out and all violations can be brought to book and both civil and criminal prosecution would be initiated. However, the powers of the RoC is subject to the overall Supervision of the ministry. There are over 10 Lakh companies registered in India and there are over 25 Field offices spread across the country, located in the capital cities of most states.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Within {{the overall}} context of {{protection}} {{of health care}} information, privacy of prescription data needs special treatment. First, the involvement of diverse parties, especially non-medical parties {{in the process of}} drug prescription complicates the protection of prescription data. Secondly, both patients and doctors have privacy stakes in prescription, and their privacy should be equally protected. Thirdly, the following facts determine that prescription should not be processed in a truly anonymous manner: certain involved parties conduct useful research on the basis of aggregation of prescription data that are linkable with respect to either the patients or the doctors; prescription data has to be identifiable in some extreme circumstances, e. g., under the court <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> and assign liability. In this paper we propose an E-prescription system to address issues pertaining to the privacy protection in the process of drug prescription. In our system patients ’ smart cards play an important role. For one thing, the smart cards are implemented to be portable repositories carrying up-to-date personal medical records and insurance information, providing doctors instant data access crucial to the process of diagnosis and prescription. For the other, with the secret signing key being stored inside, the smart card enables the patient to sign electronically the prescription pad, declaring his acceptance of the prescription. To make the system more realistic, we identify the needs for a patient to delegate his signing capability to other people so as to protect the privacy of information housed on his card. A strong proxy signature scheme achieving technologically mutual agreements on the delegation is proposed to implement the delegation functionality...|$|E

Over the years, several prisoners managed to kill themselves, so the guards were very careful in checking the shackles and cells. The prisoners received four small spoonfuls of rice porridge and watery soup of leaves twice a day. Drinking water without asking the guards for permission resulted in serious beatings. The inmates were hosed down every four days.|$|R

Almost three years ago, ASLAC contracted with O’Neil 2 ̆ 6 Associates, Inc. (O’Neil) to create a test system that would connect multiple O’Neil Electronic Maintenance System Next Generation Viewers (EMSNG) together while on an isolated computer network. The EMSNG application is used to display interactive electronic technical manuals (IETMs) which aid in the repair and maintenance of military vehicles at ASLAC’s facility and throughout the military. To connect these multiple EMSNG applications together, O’Neil created a web application system called O’Neil Electronic Maintenance System Next Generation Enhanced (EMS-NG-E). The EMS-NG-E system is a management application allowing users to initiate, assign, distribute, and manage 5988 -E work <b>orders</b> <b>for</b> both scheduled <b>inspections</b> and repairs of Army assets...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{application}} of statistical pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to vibration-based damage detection. First, the damage detection process is {{described in terms of}} a problem in statistical pattern recognition. Next, a specific example of a statistical-pattern-recognition-based damage detection process using a linear discriminant operator, ''Fisher's Discriminant'', is applied to the problem of identifying structural damage in a physical system. Accelerometer time histories are recorded from sensors attached to the system as that system is excited using a measured input. Linear Prediction Coding (LPC) coefficients are utilized to convert the accelerometer time-series data into multi-dimensional samples representing the resonances of the system during a brief segment of the time series. Fisher's discriminant is then used to find the linear projection of the LPC data distributions that best separates data from undamaged and damaged systems. The method i s applied to data from concrete bridge columns as the columns are progressively damaged. For this case, the method captures a clear distinction between undamaged and damaged vibration profiles. Further, the method assigns a probability of damage {{that can be used to}} rank systems in <b>order</b> of priority <b>for</b> <b>inspection...</b>|$|R
