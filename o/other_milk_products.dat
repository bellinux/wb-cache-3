50|$|A {{traditional}} celebration includes Matki Phod, {{similar to}} Dahi Handi in Maharashtra and Gujarat during Krishna Janmashtami, {{both in the}} memory of god Krishna who is also called makhan chor (literally, butter thief). This is a historic tradition of the Braj region as well as the western region of India. An earthen pot filled with butter or <b>other</b> <b>milk</b> <b>products</b> is hung high by a rope. Groups of boys and men climb on each other's shoulder to form pyramids to reach and break it, while girls and women sing songs and throw coloured water on the pyramid to distract them and make their job harder.

40|$|Identification {{of buffalo}} dairy {{products}} {{has become an}} important issue to ascertain product quality, consumer rights and absence of food-borne allergic reactions. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by a high resolution melting (HRM) analysis was developed and applied for species specific detection of bovine milk in nine different commercial buffalo dairy products. A specific buffalo 12 S rRNA and a bovine d-loop primer pair, targeting the mitochondrial genome, were employed in a duplex PCR assay. The analysis developed was found capable of identifying the presence of bovine milk down to 1 % in commercial buffalo <b>milk</b> <b>products</b> and also of quantifying the ratio of bovine into buffalo milk.

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{and compare the}} consumption of dairy products in cohorts included in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Methods: Data from single 24 -hour dietary recall interviews collected through a highly standardised computer-based program (EPIC-SOFT) in 27 redefined centres in 10 European countries between 1995 and 2000. From a total random sample of 36 900, 22 924 women and 13 031 men were selected after exclusion of subjects under 35 and over 74 years of age. Results: A high total consumption of dairy products was reported {{in most of the}} centres in Spain and in the UK cohort sampled from the general population, {{as well as in the}} Dutch, Swedish and Danish centres. A somewhat low consumption was reported in the Greek centre and in some of the Italian centres (Ragusa and Turin). In all centres and for both sexes, milk constituted the dairy sub-group with the largest proportion (in grams) of total dairy consumption, followed by yoghurt and <b>other</b> fermented <b>milk</b> <b>products,</b> and cheese. Still, there was a wide range in the contributions of the different dairy sub-groups between centres. The Spanish and Nordic centres generally reported a high consumption of milk, the Swedish and Dutch centres reported a high consumption of yoghurt and <b>other</b> fermented <b>milk</b> <b>products,</b> whereas the highest consumption of cheese was reported in the French centres. Conclusion: The results demonstrate both quantitative and qualitative disparities in dairy product consumption among the EPIC centres. This offers a sound starting point for analyses of associations between dairy intake and chronic diseases such as cancer...|$|R
40|$|Lactococci are {{of major}} {{economic}} importance {{for their use}} in production and preservation of cheese and <b>other</b> fermented <b>milk</b> <b>products.</b> The succes of this use depends on the fast production of lactic acid, which goes together with fast growth of lacctococci in milk. The amount of free amino acids and absorbable peptides in milk, however, {{is too small to}} sustain this fast growth. For this reason a proteolytic system, capable of degrading the milk proteins and thereby supplying the lactococcal cells of a nitrogen source, is indispensable. In chapter I, the general introduction, a brief overview is given on the lactococcal proteolyic system with the emphasis on the key enzyme in this system: the lactococcal cell envelope-located proteinase. ...|$|R
50|$|Cream cheese can be {{used for}} many {{purposes}} in sweet and savoury cookery, and is in the same family of ingredients as <b>other</b> <b>milk</b> <b>products,</b> such as cream, milk, butter, and yogurt. It {{can be used}} in cooking to make cheesecake and to thicken sauces and make them creamy. Cream cheese is sometimes used in place of or with butter (typically two parts cream cheese to one part butter) when making cakes or cookies, and cream cheese frosting. It is the main ingredient in the filling of crab rangoon, an appetizer commonly served at U.S. Chinese restaurants. It can also be used instead of or with butter or olive oil in mashed potatoes, and in some westernized sushi rolls.|$|E
50|$|In 1864, Cham was {{connected}} to the Zürich-Lucerne train line. In 1866, the American Page family founded the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company in Cham {{to take advantage of this}} new rail line. The company initially produced only condensed milk, but soon grew to produce <b>other</b> <b>milk</b> <b>products.</b> In 1905, it merged with the Farine Lactée Henri Nestlé Company to form Nestlé. The company expanded rapidly; by 1907, they had over 1,000 milkmen in 44 locations. In 1913 a conflict over money between the factory and the milkmen led to a strike and weakened the company. Following World War I, the company faced financial crisis and began to shut down production in Cham.|$|E
50|$|Dahi Handi {{is celebrated}} every August/September, {{the day after}} Krishna Janmashtami. It {{involves}} communities hanging an earthen pot filled with dahi (yoghurt) or other milk-based delicacy, at a convenient or difficult to reach height. Young men and boys form teams, make a human pyramid and attempt to reach or break the pot. As they do so, girls surround them, sing with music, and cheer them on. It is a public spectacle, and well organized historic tradition of Hindus, with media attendance, prize money and commercial sponsorships. The event {{is based on the}} legend of the Krishna stealing butter and <b>other</b> <b>milk</b> <b>products</b> as a baby (he is also called Makhan chor), the community hiding the products by hanging them high out of his reach, but he finding creative ways to reach what he wanted.|$|E

2500|$|To {{some extent}} the Rashaida {{alleviate}} these discrepancies by processing milk {{that is not}} needed by the calf or for immediate human consumption into storable <b>products.</b> Unprocessed camel <b>milk</b> remains fit for consumption for four to five days, although its acidity increases significantly during this period. It can be processed into {{two different types of}} product with practically unlimited [...] "shelf-life" [...] by very simple procedures. Milk may be turned into butter (zibde) by shaking it in a goatskin or other container for about one hour. Through heating, zibde turns into zamin (clarified butter or ghee) which is then used as cooking fat or eaten with sorghum porridge or bread. The <b>other</b> <b>milk</b> <b>product</b> described by the Rashaida is madhur, made by boiling sour milk until it coagulates. The clotted substance is then drained through a piece of gauze, formed into balls and sun-dried. In this form milk stores for almost indefinite periods and can be reconstituted during droughts or the dry season by pulverizing and adding water. Since it is often held that camel milk does not lend itself to butter or cheese production, these practices of the Rashaida are noteworthy. However, because the women and smallstock are usually separated from the camel herds during the rainy season when milk yields are abundant, only a small proportion of the milk is processed.|$|R

40|$|The EU {{dairy sector}} {{will be one}} of the most {{sensitive}} sectors to be affected by the outcome of the on-going negotiations for the new WTO round for agriculture. Nevertheless, if the Next WTO Round is going to be along the same lines as the Uruguay Round, the EU may be able to stay within the WTO commitments for export subsidy in the dairy sector without further reforms in the Common Agricultural Policy. Certainly, some minor reforms are needed to relieve the binding commitments for cheese and <b>other</b> <b>milk</b> <b>products.</b> The upcoming reform in the dairy sector under Agenda 2000 starting from year 2005 may help in reforming the dairy sector for the new round. In contrast, a steeper reduction in the export subsidy commitments compared to the Uruguay Round may cause problems for cheese and <b>other</b> <b>milk</b> <b>products</b> because the majority of exports in these products will have to be exported without any export subsidy. After enlargement, in particular with a steeper reduction formula, the EU may face troubles in the categories of butter, skim milk powder, cheese, and <b>other</b> <b>milk</b> <b>products.</b> The reforms under Agenda 2000 may not be sufficient because the difference between the EU internal market price and world market price is still too high for EU dairy products to allow unsubsidised exports to the world market. The EU internal market will have to absorb the dairy products intended for the export market. Consequently, the EU internal market for dairy products will be under pressure for further price reduction, and the EU world market share in dairy products will shrink.
