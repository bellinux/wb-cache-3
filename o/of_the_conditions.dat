5|$|Human {{cultures}} have developed many {{views of the}} planet. Earth is sometimes personified as a deity.

5|$|Hydroxyl megamasers {{occur in}} the nuclear regions of LIRGs, and {{appear to be a}} marker in the stage of the {{formation}} of galaxies. As hydroxyl emission is not subject to extinction by interstellar dust in its host LIRG, hydroxyl masers may be useful probes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> where star formation in LIRGs takes place. At redshifts of z ~ 2, there are LIRG-like galaxies more luminous than the ones in the nearby universe. The observed relationship between the hydroxyl luminosity and far infrared luminosity suggests that hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies may be tens to hundreds of times more luminous than observed hydroxyl megamasers. Detection of hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies would allow precise determination of the redshift, and aid understanding of star formation in these objects.|$|E

5|$|Most {{stars are}} {{observed}} {{to be members}} of binary star systems, and the properties of those binaries are the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> in which they formed. A gas cloud must lose its angular momentum in order to collapse and form a star. The fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that angular momentum. The primordial binaries transfer some angular momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated (soft) binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound. This produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions.|$|E

In 1975, Fischer refused to defend his title when an agreement could not be reached with FIDE, the game's international governing body, over one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> for the match.
