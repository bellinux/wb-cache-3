40|$|In this paper, a {{new method}} is {{proposed}} to improve the canonical Katz back-off smoothing technique in language modeling. The process of Katz smoothing is detailedly analyzed and the global discounting parameters are selected for discounting. Further more, {{a modified version of}} the formula for discounting parameters is proposed, in which the discounting parameters are determined by not only the <b>occurring</b> <b>counts</b> of the n-gram units but also the low-order history frequencies. This modification makes the smoothing more reasonable for those n-gram units that have homophonic (same in pronunciation) histories. The new method is tested on a Chinese Pinyin-to-character (where Pinyin is the pronunciation string) conversion system and the results show that the improved method can achieve a surprising reduction both in perplexity and Chinese character error rate. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} analytical, Monte Carlo, {{and empirical}} evidence on models for event count data. Event counts are dependent variables that measure {{the number of}} times some event <b>occurs.</b> <b>Counts</b> of international events are probably the most common, but numerous examples exist in every empirical field of the discipline. The results of the analysis below strongly suggest that the way event counts have been analyzed in hundreds of important political science studies have produced statistically and substantively unreliable results. Misspecification, inefficiency, bias, inconsistency, insufficiency, and other problems result from the unknowing application of two common methods that are without theoretical justification or empirical utility in this type of data. I show that the exponential Poisson regression (EPR) model provides analytically, in large samples, and empirically, in small, finite samples, a far superior model and optimal estimator. I also demonstrate the advantage of this methodology in an application to nineteenth-century party switching in the U. S. Congress. Its use by political scientists is strongly encouraged. 1...|$|R

40|$|Does {{there exist}} a {{naturally}} <b>occurring</b> <b>counting</b> device that might elucidate the hidden structure of prime numbers ?" {{is a question}} that has fascinated computer scientists and mathematical physicists for decades. While most recent research in this area have explored the role of the Riemann zeta-function in different formulations of statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics and quantum chaotic systems, the resulting devices (quantum or classical) have only existed in theory or the fabrication of the device {{has been found to be}} not scalable to large prime numbers. Here we report for the first time that any hypothetical prime number generator, to our knowledge, has to be a special case of a dynamical system that is governed by the physics of Fowler-Nordheim (FN) quantum-tunneling. In this paper we report how such a dynamical system can be implemented using a counting process that naturally arises from sequential FN tunneling and integration of electrons on a floating-gate (FG) device. The self-compensating physics of the FG device makes the operation reliable and repeatable even when tunneling-currents approach levels below 1 attoamperes. We report measured results from different variants of fabricated prototypes, each of which shows an excellent match with the asymptotic prime number statistics. We also report similarities between the spectral signatures produced by the FN device and the spectral statistics of a hypothetical prime number sequence generator. We believe that the proposed floating-gate device could have future implications in understanding the process that generates prime numbers with applications in security and authentication.

The ZINB model is considered as an alternative for the Zero-Inflated Generalized Poisson (ZIGP) model for zero-inflated overdispersed count data. Consequently, zero-inflated models have been proposed for the situations where the data generating process results are overdispersed.
