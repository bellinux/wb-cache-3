2500|$|In many ways, the {{soldiers}} stationed at Fort Douglas were spoiling for a fight. [...] In addition to discipline problems among {{the soldiers}}, {{there was a}} minor [...] "mutiny" [...] among the soldiers where a joint petition {{by most of the}} California Volunteers made a request to withhold over $30,000 from their paychecks {{for the sole purpose of}} instead paying for naval passage to the eastern states, and to [...] "serve their country in shooting traitors instead of eating rations and freezing to death around sage brush fires..."

[...] The <b>original</b> <b>emphasis</b> of Cistercian life was on manual labour and self-sufficiency, and many abbeys have traditionally supported themselves through activities such as agriculture and brewing ales.

[...] Upon receiving a thank-you letter with Thurman's name as editor on the letterhead, she withdrew, despite pleas from Alexander acknowledging Thurman's [...] "selfish treatment {{of those who have}} helped him gain a place in the literary world" [...] and stating that he would not let Thurman run amok. [...] Alexander asked Peterson to ask her friends [...] "to forbear [...] to with-hold their criticism until they have the first issue at hand to criticize" [...] (<b>original</b> <b>emphasis</b> and underlining). [...] Larsen also declined, on the grounds that {{she was not going to}} be paid for her submissions, confessing that her ultimate goal in writing was [...] "money".
