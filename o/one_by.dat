40|$|Riffles and pools have {{important}} roles for a river ecology and river environment. It {{is useful to}} develop a method for creation of riffle and pool. Our final goal is a development of technical method for creation of riffles and pools by means of over flow from weir. As first stage of it, we have studied that the characteristics of scours created by over flow from a sharp crested weir and an inclined weir. The main {{results of this study}} are as follows; (1) The maximum scour depths by the inclined weir are small compared with <b>ones</b> <b>by</b> the sharp crested weir when the gradients of inclined weir are mild. However, <b>ones</b> <b>by</b> the inclined weir approach <b>ones</b> <b>by</b> the sharp crested weir as the gradient of inclined weir become steep.

By 17:00, Boadicea pulled alongside Africaine and the French prize crew surrendered. Rowley later reported that a number of British sailors leaped into the sea at his approach and swam to Boadicea, requesting that they be allowed to pursue the French ships in the hope of capturing one.|$|E

5|$|George {{wakes up}} the next morning on the river bank, and finds a treehouse {{belonging}} to a Christian missionary named Father Hubert. Hubert has been nursing Nico back to health, but she has suffered a snakebite and requires special medicine. He takes George to the local Mayan village, as he believes the village Shaman will be able to help. George shows his Mayan stone to the shaman, who explains that, hundreds of years ago, Mayan shamans had trapped the god Tezcatlipoca inside a mirror. However, he was so powerful that he would inevitably escape, so they created three stones that contained the power to keep him imprisoned. Before they could be put in place, they were stolen by explorers: <b>one</b> <b>by</b> a Spanish pirate named Captain Ketch, who hid it in the Caribbean; <b>one</b> <b>by</b> an English ship, which took it to England; and <b>one</b> <b>by</b> Spanish explorers, who took it back to Spain. The third of these stones was in Nico's and George's possession. George returns to the treehouse and cures Nico with medicine from the shaman. Shortly thereafter, the two separate to find the two remaining stones.|$|E
