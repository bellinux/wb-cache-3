5|$|The film {{opens to}} a shot of an {{abandoned}} office, where the main character (Pierre Jolivet), who is only identified as 'The Man' in the end credits, is having intercourse with a sex doll. The Man is then seen attempting to salvage parts from abandoned vehicles, but returns to his dwelling empty handed, where he works on building a makeshift aircraft. The Man ventures <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> building he lives in, which is surrounded by a desert wasteland. A group of men are shown surviving in the wasteland. They hold a man, 'The Dwarf' (Maurice Lamy), captive, and force him to retrieve water for them. The Man, who has been observing the survivors, makes his way to their camp, stabs their leader, 'The Captain' (Fritz Wepper) and retrieves a car battery. Survivors pursue The Man, though he is able to escape in his now completed aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Mail {{service was}} chaotic during the stampede. Apart {{from the number}} of prospectors, two major {{obstacles}} stood in its way. To begin with, any mail from America to Dawson City was sent to Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses. The second problem was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in a single shipment, all of which had to be collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> for up to three days. Those who had no time and could afford it would pay others to stand in line for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed to get ahead in line out of politeness. Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained postal staff took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|E

25|$|In 1954, Puerto Rican nationalists {{opened fire}} on members of Congress from the visitors' gallery, {{injuring}} five representatives. On March 1, 1971, a bomb exploded {{on the ground floor}} of the Capitol, placed by the radical left domestic terrorist group, the Weather Underground. They placed the bomb as a demonstration against U.S. involvement in Laos. On November 7, 1983, a group called the Armed Resistance Unit claimed responsibility for a bomb that detonated in the lobby <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> of Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd. Six people associated with the John Brown Anti-Klan Committee were later found in contempt of court for refusing to testify about the bombing. In 1990, three members of the Armed Resistance Unit were convicted of the bombing, which they claimed was in response to the invasion of Grenada. On July 24, 1998, Russell Eugene Weston Jr. burst into the Capitol and opened fire, killing two Capitol Police officers. The Capitol is believed to have been the intended target of the hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11, 2001, before it crashed near Shanksville in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, after passengers tried to take over control of the plane from hijackers.|$|E
500|$|In November 1993, an {{internal}} memo was circulated in the Cabinet Office informing staff that Humphrey {{was suffering from}} a minor kidney complaint and had been put on a special diet.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg and {{directed}} by Tucker Gates. While the characters travel to Mall at Steamtown, a shopping center in Scranton, Pennsylvania, filming actually took place in Los Angeles. Cast members Jenna Fischer and Kate Flannery enjoyed the three-day shoot <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>office,</b> and the latter was able to perform her own driving stunts. While filming, the cast were often met with fans [...] "in full force" [...] yelling out Steve Carell's name and taking pictures. Retailer Victoria's Secret agreed to close their mall store to the public to allow for episode filming.|$|E
500|$|According to Nicholson, [...] "we {{never did}} shoot {{the end of}} the scene. This movie was pre-lit. You'd go in, plug in the lights, roll the camera, and shoot. We did the take <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> and went inside the office, plugged in, lit and rolled. Jonathan Haze was up on my chest pulling my teeth out. And in the take, he leaned back and hit the rented dental {{machinery}} {{with the back of his}} leg and it started to tip over. Roger didn't even call cut. He leapt onto the set, grabbed the tilting machine, and said 'Next set, that's a wrap.'" [...] By 9am of the first day, Corman was informed by the production manager that he was behind schedule.|$|E
500|$|Shearer later {{complained of}} a lack of {{chemistry}} between Michelle Phillips and Patrick Stewart, which Phillips blamed on the conflicted nature of the character in that she was committed to her husband but also wanted to see Picard once more.

Rod Loomis's previous science fiction outing was in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure as Sigmund Freud, and Lance Spellerberg would later return in [...] "The Icarus Factor" [...] where his transporter chief gained the name Ensign Herbert.

500|$|After {{serving as}} {{secretary}} to several more commissions, {{he was made}} Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office in 1915. Schuster served in this position for 29 years under ten different Lord Chancellors, and with the contacts obtained thanks to his long tenure and his work <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>Office</b> he became [...] "one {{of the most influential}} Permanent Secretaries of the 20th century". His influence over decisions within the Lord Chancellor's Office and greater Civil Service led to criticism and suspicions that he was a [...] "power behind the throne", which culminated in a verbal attack by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Hewart in 1934 during a session of the House of Lords. Schuster retired in 1944 and was made Baron Schuster, of Cerne, in the County of Dorset. Despite being officially retired he continued to work in government circles, such as with the Allied Commission for Austria and by using his seat in the House of Lords as a way to directly criticise legislation.|$|E
500|$|Andy confronts Dwight and {{challenges}} {{him to a}} [...] "duel" [...] in the parking lot, with Angela as a prize to the winner. Dwight accepts and Angela, anxious to avoid making a choice {{between the two men}} herself, says she will honor the results of the duel. Jim, acting as office manager in Michael's absence, tries to talk them out of the duel and confiscates Dwight's hidden weapons around the office, but concedes he does not have the power to prevent a fight <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>office.</b> Meanwhile in New York, Michael is nervous about why David Wallace wants to meet with him. But as the meeting begins, David tells him Scranton is the most successful Dunder Mifflin branch amid a difficult economic climate, and he wants to learn why Michael's management has been so successful. Michael is delighted with the compliment and attention, but can only manage vague, off-topic and largely nonsensical answers. David claims it is difficult for someone to make a self-evaluation, and Michael leaves the meeting in a very pleasant mood.|$|E
500|$|In early 1941, {{when the}} {{movement}} was at its height, Dilling spoke at rallies in Chicago and other cities in the Midwest, and recruited a group to coordinate her efforts to oppose Lend-Lease, the [...] "Mothers' Crusade to Defeat H. R. 1776". Hundreds of these activists picketed the Capitol for two weeks in February 1941. Dilling was arrested when she led a sit-down strike with at least 25 other protesters in the corridor <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> of 84-year-old Senator Carter Glass. After a sensational trial lasting six days, she wept as she {{was found guilty of}} disorderly conduct and fined $25. Glass called for the FBI to investigate the women's groups, and stated in the New York Times on March 7 that the women had caused [...] "a noisy disorder of which any self-respecting fishwife would be ashamed. I likewise believe that it would be pertinent to inquire whether they are mothers. For the sake of the race, I devoutly hope not." [...] Isolationist leader Cathrine Curtis believed that the image of the Mothers' movement had been wrecked, and privately criticised Dilling's [...] "hoodlum" [...] tactics as [...] "communistic" [...] and [...] "un-womanly".|$|E

500|$|Baker found {{enjoyment}} <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> through sports. He {{joined the}} St. Nicholas Club, an amateur hockey team in New York, {{soon after he}} arrived in the city. Pyne introduced Baker to both polo and auto racing, sports he quickly mastered. Baker remained well known from his time at Princeton; marquees at his home arena, which was shared with Princeton, often said [...] "Hobey Baker Plays Tonight". This made Baker uncomfortable and he eventually asked the building manager to take down the sign. Preferring a life {{out of the public}} eye, he once told a reporter that he would rather have nothing written about him. In order to leave the arena quickly after hockey games without having to deal with the public, Baker often borrowed Pyne's valet and car. During the two years that Baker played hockey with St. Nicholas, he was {{recognized as one of the}} best players in the American Amateur Hockey League and named to the post-season All-Star Teams both years. While still with the St. Nicholas Club, Baker was offered a contract by the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey Association. He turned down an offer of $20,000 to play three seasons as social conventions prohibited a person of his standing from playing sports for money.|$|E
