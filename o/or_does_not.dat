ZnO:Al coatings {{are used for}} energy-saving or heat-protecting windows. The coating lets the visible part of the spectrum in but either reflects the infrared (IR) radiation {{back into the room}} (energy saving) <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> let the IR radiation into the room (heat protection), depending on which side of the window has the coating.|$|E
5|$|Ain't meaning didn't {{is widely}} {{considered}} a feature unique to African American Vernacular English, although {{it can be found}} in some dialects of Caribbean English as well. It may function not as a true variant of didn't, but as a creole-like tense-neutral negator (sometimes termed generic ain't). Its origin may have been due to approximation when early African Americans acquired English as a second language; {{it is also possible that}} early African Americans inherited this variation from colonial European-Americans, and later kept the variation when it largely passed out of wider usage. Ain't is rarely attested for the present-tense constructions do not <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>not.</b>|$|E
5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> believe in asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E
50|$|Everything we <b>do</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>do,</b> wish <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> wish, {{and have}} <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have has an {{explicit}} or an implicit relevance to how good or not good we perceive {{our lives to}} be. Because the preference for a good life over a bad life underlies all facets of our lives, understanding what constitutes and influences a good life on an individual level has a significant value for all people.|$|R

5|$|Others have redefined this concept, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with forming a belief, and only incompatible with absolute certainty. George H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word, and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word, promoted broadening {{the definition of}} atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view {{of those who do}} not believe in the existence of any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity does <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> exist) and agnostic theism (the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E
5|$|The Augustinian theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil, which raises the concern that if God is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil can call into question God's nature or his existence– he is either not omnipotent, not benevolent, <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> exist. Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile the existence and nature of God with evidence of evil in the world by providing valid explanations for its occurrence. The Augustinian theodicy asserts that God created the world ex nihilo (out of nothing), but maintains that God did not create evil and is not responsible for its occurrence. Evil is not attributed existence in its own right, but is described as the privation of good– the corruption of God's good creation.|$|E

By Proof 1 this is impossible. So the first assertion that E exists, is wrong: E does not exist.|$|E
25|$|Riepe {{states that}} the Ajivikas belief in predeterminism {{does not mean that}} they were pessimistic. Rather, just like Calvinists belief in predeterminism in Europe, the Ajivikas were optimists.

Actions had immediate effects in one's current life but without any moral traces, and both the action and the effect was predetermined, according to the Ajivikas.|$|E

25|$|Stress {{is thought}} to affect immune {{function}} through emotional and/or behavioral manifestations such as anxiety, fear, tension, anger and sadness and physiological changes such as heart rate, blood pressure, and sweating. Researchers have suggested that these changes are beneficial if they are of limited duration, but when stress is chronic, the system is unable to maintain equilibrium or homeostasis; the body remains {{in a state of}} arousal, where digestion is slower to reactivate <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> reactivate properly, often resulting in indigestion. Furthermore, blood pressure stays at higher levels.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the second}} edition, Power Points and Power Levels are independent, {{the latter being}} set by the Game Master as a {{function}} of the campaign. The 2e concept of Power Level determines only the maximum bonus that any power can give, and does not imply that a character does <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have the points required to purchase enough levels in any power to reach this limit. Though the two are described as being entirely independent, the Mutants & Masterminds manual recommends that the Power Level be increased by one with each 15 Power Points awarded.|$|E
25|$|Cantor's {{article also}} {{contains}} a proof {{of the existence of}} transcendental numbers. As early as 1930, mathematicians have disagreed on whether this proof is constructive or non-constructive. Books as recent as 2014 and 2015 indicate that this disagreement has not been resolved. Since Cantor's proof either constructs transcendental numbers <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>not,</b> an analysis of his article can determine whether his proof is constructive or non-constructive. Cantor's correspondence with Richard Dedekind shows the development of his ideas and reveals that he had a choice between two proofs, one that uses the uncountability of the real numbers and one that does not.|$|E
