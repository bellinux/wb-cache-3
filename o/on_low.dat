40|$|Empirical {{research}} has demonstrated differences between religiosity and spirituality; the current study further clarifies the constructs by exploring their respective divergent and convergent validities in relation to two higher-order factors of the Big Five personality variables, traditionalism and transformation. The current study examines the relationships among personality, spirituality, religiosity and mysticism. Predictions were partially supported. Participants high <b>on</b> traditionalism and <b>low</b> <b>on</b> transformation scored higher in extrinsic religious orientation compared to those <b>low</b> <b>on</b> traditionalism and high <b>on</b> transformation. Participants <b>low</b> <b>on</b> traditionalism and high on transformation did not score higher on spirituality compared to those high <b>on</b> traditionalism and <b>low</b> <b>on</b> transformation. Participants high on intrinsic religious motivation and <b>low</b> <b>on</b> extrinsic motivation were more spiritual than those <b>low</b> <b>on</b> intrinsic motivation and high on extrinsic; and, participants high <b>on</b> spirituality and <b>low</b> <b>on</b> religiosity reported more mystical experiences than those <b>low</b> <b>on</b> spirituality and high on religiosity...|$|R

40|$|Whether or {{not close}} {{emotional}} relationships {{with parents and}} peers serve similar functions for adolescent adjustment {{is an issue of}} increasing interest. The present study was designed to examine the relations between parent and peer attachment and adolescent adjustment. Eighty-nine adolescents (M age = 16. 1 years, SD = 1. 8 years) completed self-report measures of parent and peer attachment, sympathy, academic efficacy, aggression, anxiety, and depression. Adolescents were divided into four groups {{on the basis of their}} parent and peer attachment scores: those high <b>on</b> both, those <b>low</b> <b>on</b> both, those high <b>on</b> peer but <b>low</b> <b>on</b> parent attachment, and those high <b>on</b> parent but <b>low</b> <b>on</b> peer attachment. Discriminant function analyses revealed that the groups differed only along one dimension, suggesting that parent and peer attachment served similar functions in terms of the adjustment indices measured. Adolescents high on both peer and parent attachment were the best adjusted (i. e., least aggressive and depressed, most sympathetic) and those <b>low</b> <b>on</b> both were the least well adjusted. Furthermore, those high <b>on</b> peer but <b>low</b> <b>on</b> parent attachment were better adjusted than those high <b>on</b> parent but <b>low</b> <b>on</b> peer attachment, suggesting that peer attachment may be relatively more influential on adolescent adjustment than parent attachment...|$|R
5|$|Agnew's term as {{governor}} {{was marked by}} modestly progressive policies, which included tax reform, clean water regulations, and the repeal of laws against interracial marriage. Community health programs were expanded, as were higher educational and employment opportunities for those <b>on</b> <b>low</b> incomes. Steps were taken towards ending segregation in schools. Agnew's fair housing legislation was limited, applying only to new projects above a certain size. These were the first such laws passed south of the Mason–Dixon line.

5|$|Although motte-and-bailey castles are {{the best}} known castle design, they were not always the most {{numerous}} in any given area. A popular alternative was the ringwork castle, involving a palisade being built {{on top of a}} raised earth rampart, protected by a ditch. The choice of motte and bailey or ringwork was partially driven by terrain, as mottes were typically built <b>on</b> <b>low</b> ground, and on deeper clay and alluvial soils. Another factor may have been speed, as ringworks were faster to build than mottes. Some ringwork castles were later converted into motte-and-bailey designs, by filling in the centre of the ringwork to produce a flat-topped motte. The reasons for why this decision was taken are unclear; motte-and-bailey castles may have been felt to be more prestigious, or easier to defend; another theory is that like the terpen in Netherlands, or Vorburg and Hauptburg in Lower Rhineland, raising the height of the castle was done to create a drier site.|$|E
5|$|Another {{similarity}} {{with the}} stegosaurs is the narrow head, which might indicate a selective diet consisting of high-quality fodder. However, Barrett {{pointed out that}} for an animal the size of Scelidosaurus, with a large gut allowing efficient fermentation, the intake of easily digestible food of high energetic value was less important than with smaller animals, that are often critically dependent on it. Norman concluded that Scelidosaurus fed <b>on</b> <b>low</b> scrubby vegetation, with a height up to one metre. Raising itself on its hindlimbs alone, could have vertically increased the feeding envelope and was perhaps anatomically possible, but Norman doubted it was a relevant part of its behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Being herbivores, {{blackbuck}} graze <b>on</b> <b>low</b> grasses, occasionally browsing as well. They prefer sedges, fall witchgrass, mesquite, {{and live}} oak. They have occasionally been observed browsing on acacia {{trees in the}} Cholistan Desert. Oats and berseem {{were found to be}} palatable and nutritious to captive populations in a study. A study in the Velavadar Black Buck Sanctuary (Gujarat, India) showed that Dichanthium annulatum comprised 35 percent of their diet. Digestion of nutrients, especially crude proteins, was poor in summer, but more efficient in the rainy and winter seasons. Consequently crude protein intake in summer was very low, even below the recommended value. Blackbuck had a lower food consumption in summer. The fruits of Prosopis juliflora are often eaten, and blackbuck {{may play a role in}} their dispersal. Prosopis becomes a significant food item if grasses are scarce. Water is a daily requirement of the blackbuck.|$|E
5|$|Check's 1st Battalion was not {{attacked}} until 06:30 on July 24, {{shortly after}} daybreak {{in a heavy}} fog that allowed the North Koreans to approach {{very close to the}} US positions before they were observed. Two US infantry companies {{on either side of the}} road <b>on</b> <b>low</b> ridges held the forward positions. North Korean mortar fire fell on the men there, and then T-34 tanks appeared at the bend in the road and opened fire with their main cannons and machine guns as they approached. North Korean infantry followed the tanks. Although the two rifle companies stopped the North Korean infantry, the tanks penetrated their positions and fired into the battalion command post which was behind B Company. This tank fire destroyed several vehicles and killed the medical officer. A company commander knocked out one tank but was injured in the process.|$|E

5|$|In {{southern}} Palestine the wet {{season was}} approaching with another thunderstorm and heavy {{rain on the}} night of 11 November. The dark cotton soil over which the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was now advancing would not need much more rain to turn it into impassable mud. But 12 November had been fine and the roads had dried out. The rolling maritime plain was dotted with villages <b>on</b> <b>low</b> hill tops surrounded by groves and orchards. These were in turn surrounded by hedges of prickly pear or cactus, making them strong natural places of defence. In the distance to the right the spurs and valleys of the Judean Hills were visible even to the invading British Empire troops near the Mediterranean coast. On 13 November the weather was clear and fine with at first no sign of the Ottoman Army.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} if {{among those with}} non-chronic back pain {{alternative}} treatments are useful. For chiropractic care or spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) it is unclear if it improves outcomes {{more or less than}} other treatments. Some reviews find that SMT results in equal or better improvements in pain and function when compared with other commonly used interventions for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up; other reviews find it to be no more effective in reducing pain than either inert interventions, sham manipulation, or other treatments, and conclude that adding SMT to other treatments does improve outcomes. National guidelines reach different conclusions, with some not recommending spinal manipulation, some describing manipulation as optional, and others recommending a short course {{for those who do not}} improve with other treatments. A 2017 review recommended spinal manipulation based <b>on</b> <b>low</b> quality evidence. Manipulation under anaesthesia, or medically assisted manipulation, has not enough evidence to make any confident recommendation.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackbuck}} is a diurnal antelope (active mainly {{during the}} day). Three kinds of groups, typically small, are the female, male and bachelor herds. Males often adopt lekking {{as a strategy}} to garner females for mating. While other males are not allowed into these territories, females often visit these places to forage. The male can thus attempt mating with her. Herbivores, blackbuck graze <b>on</b> <b>low</b> grasses, occasionally browsing as well. Females become sexually mature at eight months, but mate no earlier than two years. Males mature later, at one-and-a-half years. Mating takes place throughout the year. Gestation is typically six months long, after which a single calf is born. The lifespan is typically 10 to 15 years.|$|E
