40|$|The current Volunteering Australia (VA) {{definition}} <b>of</b> <b>volunteering</b> {{has been}} in place since 1996 and may be too narrow for the breadth <b>of</b> <b>volunteer</b> practices undertaken in Australia today.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>volunteering</b> {{in the population}} aged 50 years or older across 11 Continental European countries.  Design and Methods: Using longitudinal data from the first 2 waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, we run multivariate regressions {{on a set of}} binary-dependent variables indicating transitions from active volunteering to inactivity and vice versa.  Results: Volunteer transitions were affected by both time-invariant individual resources and changes in individuals’ resources. Moreover, we found that the societal context in which older persons live not only has {{a significant impact on the}} prevalence <b>of</b> <b>volunteering</b> at a given point in time but that the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>volunteering</b> also vary by country.  Implications: Our study supports the notion <b>of</b> <b>volunteering</b> as an important productive aging activity and underlines the importance of both life-course and social context factors as determinants <b>of</b> <b>volunteer</b> dynamics at older ages...|$|R

One year following horseradish production, field infestations <b>of</b> <b>volunteer</b> horseradish ranged from 0. 08 to 6. 60 plants/m 2 with the majority of plants emerging from established roots left below the depth of horseradish harvest and tillage. Fall herbicide applications provided effective control <b>of</b> <b>volunteer</b> horseradish compared to the nontreated control. Combinations of 2, 4 –D tank–mixed with glyphosate, iodosulfuron, halosulfuron, or rimsulfuron:thifensulfuron achieved the greatest control <b>of</b> <b>volunteer</b> horseradish and reduced volunteer horseradish densities to less than 1 plant /m 2, while glyphosate alone provided the least control and density reduction. In addition to volunteer horseradish control, combinations of 2, 4 –D with glyphosate, iodosulfuron, halosulfuron, or rimsulfuron:thifensulfuron also provided 97 % or greater control of winter annual weeds (henbit, common chickweed, and Carolina foxtail). Although the herbicide halosulfuron is very effective at controlling volunteer horseradish, {{it has the potential to}} injure future horseradish crops due to soil persistence. Field studies showed that after 4 months following a June halosulfuron application, horseradish can be replanted with no visual injury or reduction in root biomass. Tillage may provide temporary removal <b>of</b> <b>volunteer</b> horseradish plants, however, herbicide applications (e. g., 2, 4 –D with halosulfuron, iodosulfuron or rimsulfuron:thifensulfuron) provide the most consistent, complete control <b>of</b> <b>volunteer</b> horseradish...|$|R
