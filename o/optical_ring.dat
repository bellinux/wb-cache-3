The algorithms aim to segment the network into smaller and isolated virtual datacentres (VDCs), where all racks {{are able to}} communicate at full capacity irrespective of their placement. Since the NEPHELE architecture relies on shared <b>optical</b> <b>rings,</b> the isolation of VDC traffic is challenging. Observing its close resemblance to finding a bi-clique on a bipartite graph, which is NP-hard, we propose heuristic algorithms which find a solution by limiting either the spatial spread of racks that construct each VDC or their wavelength allocation. If a solution cannot be found, then the algorithms invoke a second de-fragmentation phase, where they re-allocate the racks of existing VDCs to concentrate them spatially and reduce traffic on the shared <b>optical</b> <b>rings.</b> It is demonstrated via simulation that the proposed heuristics can achieve very high utilization and also exhibit low VDC request blocking probability for typically expected VDC sizes...|$|R

50|$|An <b>optical</b> <b>ring</b> {{resonator}} {{is a set}} of waveguides {{in which}} at least one is a closed loop coupled to some sort of light input and output. (These can be, {{but are not limited to}} being, waveguides.) The concepts behind <b>optical</b> <b>ring</b> resonators are the same as those behind whispering galleries except that they use light and obey the properties behind constructive interference and total internal reflection. When light of the resonant wavelength is passed through the loop from input waveguide, it builds up in intensity over multiple round-trips due to constructive interference and is output to the output bus waveguide which serves as a detector waveguide. Because only a select few wavelengths will be at resonance within the loop, the <b>optical</b> <b>ring</b> resonator functions as a filter. Additionally, as implied earlier, two or more ring waveguides can be coupled to each other to form an add/drop optical filter.|$|E

50|$|The light {{travelling}} {{through the}} waveguides in an <b>optical</b> <b>ring</b> resonator remain within the waveguides {{due to the}} ray optics phenomenon known as total internal reflection (TIR). TIR is an optical phenomenon that occurs when a ray of light strikes the boundary of a medium and fails to refract through the boundary. Given that the angle of incidence {{is larger than the}} critical angle (with respect to the normal of the surface) and the refractive index is lower {{on the other side of}} the boundary relative to the incident ray, TIR will occur and no light will be able to pass through. For an <b>optical</b> <b>ring</b> resonator to work well, total internal reflection conditions must be met and the light travelling through the waveguides must not be allowed to escape by any means.|$|E

50|$|Critical to {{understanding}} how an <b>optical</b> <b>ring</b> resonator works, {{is the concept}} of how the linear waveguides are coupled to the ring waveguide. When a beam of light passes through a wave guide as shown in the graph on the right, part of light will be coupled into the <b>optical</b> <b>ring</b> resonator. The reason for this phenomenon to happen is because the wave property of the light, or if we consider it in ray optics, it is because of the transmission effect. In other words, if the ring and the waveguide are close enough, the light in the waveguide will be transmitted into the ring. There are three aspects that affect the optical coupling: the distance, the coupling length and the refractive indices between the waveguide and the <b>optical</b> <b>ring</b> resonator. In order to optimize the coupling, it is usually the case to narrow the distance between the ring resonator and the waveguide. The closer the distance, the easier the optical coupling happens. In addition, the coupling length affects the coupling as well. The coupling length represents the effective curve length of the ring resonator for the coupling phenomenon to happen with the waveguide. It has been studied that as the optical coupling length increases, the difficulty for the coupling to happen decreases. Furthermore, the refractive index of the waveguide material, the ring resonator material and the medium material in between the waveguide and the ring resonator also affect the optical coupling. The medium material is usually the important one been studied since it has a great effect on the transmission of the light wave. The refractive index of the medium can be either large or small according to various applications and purposes.|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the <b>optical</b> <b>ring</b> {{resonator}} and how it [...] "filters" [...] certain wavelengths of light passing through, it is possible to create high-order optical filters by cascading many <b>optical</b> <b>ring</b> resonators in series. This would allow for [...] "small size, low losses, and integrability into existing optical networks." [...] Additionally, since the resonance wavelengths can be changed by simply increasing or decreasing the radius of each ring, the filters can be considered tunable. This basic property can be used to create a sort of mechanical sensor. If an optical fiber experiences mechanical strain, the dimensions of the fiber will be altered, thus resulting in a change in the resonant wavelength of light emitted. This can be used to monitor fibers or waveguides for changes in their dimensions.The tuning process can be effected also by a change of refractive index using various means including thermo-optic, electro-optic [...] or all-optical [...] effects. Electro-optic and all-optical tuning is faster than thermal and mechanical means, and hence find various applications including in optical communication. Optical modulators with a high-Q microring are reported to yield outstandingly small power of modulation at a speed of > 50 Gbit/s at cost of a tuning power to match wavelength of the light source. A ring modulator placed in a Fabry-Perot laser cavity was reported to eliminate the tuning power by automatic matching of the laser wavelength with that of the ring modulator while maintaining high-speed ultralow-power modulation of a Si microring modulator.|$|E
