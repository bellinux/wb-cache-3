5|$|Early on June4, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{an area of}} {{low pressure}} associated with deep convection about 780km (485mi) south-southeast of Hong Kong. Later that day, following notable development, they classified the system as Tropical Depression 07W. At the same time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also began monitoring the system as a tropical depression. Slowly moving towards the southeast, 07W gradually strengthened, being classified a tropical storm by the JTWC at 1200UTC the next day. Around the same time, the storm entered the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration's area <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> was given the local name Frank. Twenty-four hours later, 07W made its closest approach to the Philippines, passing within 295km (185mi) of Manila. A few hours later, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Conson; a name contributed by Vietnam that is a picturesque place in the country, consisting of a mountain, pine forest, streams, pagodas and many historical monuments.|$|E

5|$|On July7, the typhoon {{entered the}} Philippine area <b>of</b> <b>Responsibility</b> <b>and</b> was {{assigned}} the local name Falcon. Chan-hom's eye briefly improved in structure before entering {{a state of}} flux and collapsing later that day; convection on the northern side of the storm diminished simultaneously. The 65km (40mi) wide eye soon re-established itself and slowly contracted to a diameter of 40km (25mi) by July8. A large storm, gale-force winds extended 445km (275mi) from Chan-hom's center on July9. Late on July9 into July10, Chan-hom passed between the Japanese islands of Okinawa and Miyako-jima. The typhoon reached its peak strength during this time with estimated winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a barometric pressure of 935mbar (hPa; 27.61inHg). Featuring multiple intense feeder bands and a well-defined 27km (17mi) eye, the JTWC assessed Chan-hom to have peaked as a Category4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale with one-minute sustained winds of 220km/h (140mph).|$|E

5|$|Shortly after peaking in intensity, Darby {{moved over}} coolers waters {{and began to}} deteriorate. The eye became less {{well-defined}} and the associated convection started weakening. Increasingly colder waters and growing wind shear continued to affect Darby, and the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm on July 30. The low-level center of circulation became exposed from the thunderstorm activity, and the storm quickly degenerated into a swirl of clouds, although it maintained tropical storm strength. On July 31, it weakened to a tropical depression. Darby soon crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area <b>of</b> <b>responsibility,</b> <b>and</b> it dissipated as a tropical cyclone on August 1. However, its remnants continued westward under the low-level trade winds, and dropped heavy rainfall on Hawaii several days after the cyclone dissipated.|$|E
5|$|On December 13, the US Navy {{started to}} monitor {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather that was located about 720km (480mi), {{to the east of}} Honiara in the Solomon Islands. During that day, TCWC Nadi started to monitor the system as a tropical depression as the system moved southeast towards Fiji. Over the next couple of days, the depression continued to move southeast towards Fiji and gradually developed further. On December 15, the NPMOC initiated advisories on the depression and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 04P, while it was located about 110km (70mi) to the northeast of Labasa, Fiji. Later that day, the NPMOC reported that the system had become a tropical storm and reached its peak 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 65km/h (40mph), as it affected several Fijian islands including Vanua Levu and Thikombia. During December 16, the cyclone continued to move towards the southeast and started to affect Tonga before the NPMOC issued their final warning on the system as it had weakened into a tropical depression. During the next day, the depression moved into TCWC Wellingtons area <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> was subsequently declared extratropical.|$|E
5|$|Tracking eastward, Jasmine {{entered a}} flow of dry air, which {{prevented}} the storm from strengthening quickly at the time. On 5 February, the low–level atmospheric circulation center of Jasmine became exposed due {{to the presence of}} strong vertical wind shear. However, the cyclone was able to maintain its intensity due to the existence of an area of moisture over Australia. Throughout the rest of the day, the wind shear subdued, and the system began to organize as convective banding wrapped around the center. As a result, Cyclone Jasmine intensified into the equivalent of a Category2 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, with winds of 95km/h (60mph), sustained for 10minutes. The next day, Cyclone Jasmine began to track to the east-southeast in response to a strengthening subtropical ridge. The cyclone continued to steadily intensify as convection continued to wrap tightly around the center of Jasmine. At the same time, the storm moved out of the BOM's area <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> into the area of responsibility of the Fiji Meteorological Service's (FMS) tropical cyclone warning center at Nadi, Fiji (RSMC Nadi).|$|E
