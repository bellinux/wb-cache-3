Don agrees, though he is unimpressed with the idea. Harry and Don make a Saturday night trip to a Rolling Stones concert to meet with Stones manager Allen Klein. They end up making conversation backstage with two pot-smoking female fans. When Harry leaves {{with one of the}} girls to talk with Klein, Don waxes poetic with one over her love for the band. She makes an insulting comment about the <b>older</b> <b>generation.</b> Don responds that the <b>older</b> <b>generation</b> is simply worried for youth. Harry fails miserably at his attempt to meet with The Rolling Stones, but Don is indifferent.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1877, PedroII paid a {{visit to}} Caxias and ascertained that he could no longer remain in office. The entire cabinet {{resigned}} on 1 January 1878. His health problems had become so troubling that he had been asking repeatedly to resign since early 1876. Caxias was not only afflicted by concerns over his declining health, but increasingly felt a sense of alienation. He did not feel he could play a relevant role in politics. He belonged to an <b>older</b> <b>generation</b> who perceived the Emperor (and consequently, the monarchy) as essential for holding the nation together.|$|E
5|$|Szabó's {{first feature}} film, The Age of Illusions (1964), is a partly autobiographical {{film about the}} struggles of Szabó’s {{generation}} in starting a career, encountering the obsolescence of the <b>older</b> <b>generation,</b> and establishing romantic relationships. The appearance of a poster for François Truffaut's The 400 Blows {{in the background of}} a scene suggested Szabó's artistic compatibility with Truffaut and the French New Wave.

5|$|Cardus's {{approach}} to cricket writing was innovative, turning what {{had previously been}} largely a factual form into vivid description and criticism; he is considered by contemporaries to have influenced every subsequent cricket writer. Although he achieved his largest readership for his cricket reports and books, he considered music criticism as his principal vocation. Without any formal musical training, he was initially influenced by the <b>older</b> <b>generation</b> of critics, in particular Samuel Langford and Ernest Newman, but developed his own individual style of criticism—subjective, romantic and personal, {{in contrast to the}} objective analysis practised by Newman. Cardus's opinions and judgments were often forthright and unsparing, which sometimes caused friction with leading performers. Nevertheless, his personal charm and gregarious manner enabled him to form lasting friendships in the cricketing and musical worlds, with among others Newman, Sir Thomas Beecham and Sir Donald Bradman.|$|E
5|$|Dissatisfaction {{became more}} evident during the 1880s, and some {{officers}} began to display open insubordination. The Emperor {{and the politicians}} did nothing to improve the military nor meet their demands. The dissemination of Positivist ideology among young officers brought further complications, as Positivism opposed the monarchy under the belief that a dictatorial republic would bring improvements. A coalition between a mutinous Army faction and the Positivist camp was formed and directly led to the republican coup on 15 November 1889. Battalions and even full regiments of soldiers loyal to the Empire, who shared {{the ideals of the}} <b>older</b> <b>generation</b> of leaders, attempted to restore the monarchy. Attempts at a restoration proved futile and supporters of the Empire were executed, arrested or forcibly retired.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Atheis came, according to Oemarjati, {{sometime during the}} early 1940s. In Mihardja's observations, Marxism–Leninism and anarcho-nihilism {{were among the most}} common ideologies in Indonesia; this led him to depict Rusli and Anwar as holding those ideologies. Meanwhile, emerging writers such as Idrus, Asrul Sani, and Chairil Anwar were increasingly critical of the <b>older</b> <b>generation</b> of Indonesian authors, whom they decried as narrow-minded and provincial. Mihardja, who was older than many contemporary writers and wrote in a similar style to the older authors, disliked this comparison; according to Maier, this may have led him to represent Chairil Anwar as a much-flawed character. Mihardja formalised his concept throughout the early 1940s and completed the writing during a period of unemployment from May 1948 until February 1949.|$|E

5|$|The {{relations}} between family members follow two patterns: {{the bonds of}} marriage serve mostly as Machiavellian means to financial ends, while the obligations of the <b>older</b> <b>generation</b> to the young {{take the form of}} sacrifice and deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. He is aware of her extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means to extort money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, who cares less about the illegitimate children she has than the jewels she sells to provide for her lover– who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac has heard was popular in Paris. This depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects the harsh reality of the unstable social structures of the time.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{perceptions}} of the Hinomaru exist in former colonies of Japan as well as within Japan itself, such as in Okinawa. In one notable example of this, on October 26, 1987, an Okinawan supermarket owner burned the Hinomaru {{before the start of}} the National Sports Festival of Japan. The flag burner, Shōichi Chibana, burned the Hinomaru not only to show opposition to atrocities committed by the Japanese army and the continued presence of U.S. forces, but also to prevent it from being displayed in public. Other incidents in Okinawa included the flag being torn down during school ceremonies and students refusing to honor the flag as it was being raised to the sounds of Kimigayo. In the capital city of Naha, Okinawa, the Hinomaru was raised for the first time since the return of Okinawa to Japan to celebrate the city's 80th anniversary in 2001. In the People's Republic of China and South Korea, both of which had been occupied by the Empire of Japan, the 1999 formal adoption of the Hinomaru was met with reactions of Japan moving towards the right and also a step towards re-militarization. The passage of the 1999 law also coincided with the debates about the status of the Yasukuni Shrine, US-Japan military cooperation and the creation of a missile defense program. In other nations that Japan occupied, the 1999 law was met with mixed reactions or glossed over. In Singapore, the <b>older</b> <b>generation</b> still harbors ill feelings toward the flag while the younger generation does not hold similar views. The Philippines government not only believed that Japan was not going to revert to militarism, but the goal of the 1999 law was to formally establish two symbols (the flag and anthem) in law and every state has a right to create national symbols. Japan has no law criminalizing the burning of the Hinomaru, but foreign flags cannot be burned in Japan. Some people have humorously drawn an analogy between the Japanese flag and the appearance of a menstruation stain on a white bedsheet.|$|E
5|$|Rocksteady decided {{early on}} in {{development}} to make Arkham Knight only for the then-upcoming next-generation of consoles, which was considered {{to allow them to}} focus on using the system resources to their fullest without reining in their ideas to accommodate the <b>older</b> <b>generation</b> systems. The game allows for up to five times the number of on-screen enemies as were possible in Arkham City, and riots can feature up to fifty on-screen enemies interacting with the environment to smash items, and spray graffiti. The technical changes also allowed for cutscenes to be rendered in real time in the game engine, where previous installments had used pre-rendered videos to compensate. Describing the scale of difference between Arkham Knight and earlier games, lead character artist Albert Feliu said that a single character model in Arkham Knight could contain the same amount of polygons used to render the entirety of Arkham Asylums environment. Arkham Knight is the first in the series to use the Apex physics simulation engine to have items like cloth, such as Batman's cape, react realistically to movement or wind. Warner Bros. supported Rocksteady's concept for the game, but both parties felt that three years was too long to wait between games, so WB Games Montréal was tasked with creating the prequel, Arkham Origins, to fill the gap.|$|E

As stated above in the economic prospects section, about 9 out of 10 Millennials feel as though they have enough money or that they will reach their long-term financial goals, even during the tough economic times, and they are more optimistic {{about the future of the}} U.S. Additionally, Millennials are also more open to change than <b>older</b> <b>generations.</b> According to the Pew Research Center that did a survey in 2008, Millennials are the most likely of any generation to self-identify as liberals and are also more supportive of progressive domestic social agenda than <b>older</b> <b>generations.</b> Finally, Millennials are less overtly religious than the <b>older</b> <b>generations.</b> About one in four Millennials are unaffiliated with any religion, which is much more than the <b>older</b> <b>generations</b> when they were the ages of Millennials.|$|R
