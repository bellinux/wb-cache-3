Includes bibliographical references (page 85 - 88). The principal objective {{of this paper is}} to find out and discuss about the experience of 60 undergraduate students have regarding <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> activities. This paper will focus on some important issues like do they have motivation to involve in <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> activities, what kinds of motivation do they have, how much autonomy they have and how it works, what language skills they are expected to use inside and outside the class, what is their present level of four skills of English language, what are the barriers they face during <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> activities, how they overcome those barriers, which activities and domain is more common and it also look upon how multimedia plays role in <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> English language learning. To make this research more authentic I have collected some information from three private universities. I have prepared a questionnaire which consists of qualitative and quantitative questions for the students. From that I have found out that English plays a vital role in their life. Most of them practice it outside the class but more in private domain rather than public. Multimedia plays an important role in their life like movies, Facebook, Online NEWS, dictionary in mobile phone etc. There are some students who think teacher is the best source of learning and there is no adequate environment of learning English outside the class. However, for most of them to dealing with <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> activities is an interesting experience. Tanjila FerdousM. A. in Englis...|$|R

At the beginning of the winter semester students were surveyed to determine their level of satisfaction with the format as well as their engagement and participation in the course. Overall, students indicated a preference for the flipped classroom over the standard lecture format and felt a high degree of engagement relative to their other courses. In this presentation we will describe the course design and discuss the positive outcomes, caveats and next steps. We will engage the audience in a conversation around the challenges and benefits of this style of teaching in science disciplines...|$|R
