5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are nonlinear partial {{differential equations}} and, as such, difficult to solve exactly. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} exact solutions are known, although only a few have direct physical applications. The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the Schwarzschild solution, the Reissner–Nordström solution and the Kerr metric, each corresponding to {{a certain type of}} black hole in an otherwise empty universe, and the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker and de Sitter universes, each describing an expanding cosmos. Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the Gödel universe (which opens up the intriguing possibility of time travel in curved spacetimes), the Taub-NUT solution (a model universe that is homogeneous, but anisotropic), and anti-de Sitter space (which has recently come to prominence in the context <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> the Maldacena conjecture).|$|E
5|$|The {{balance between}} the {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD/NADH ratio. This ratio {{is an important component}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> the redox state of a cell, a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells. The effects of the NAD/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio between free NAD and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the ratio is thus favourable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total NAD/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 3–10 in mammals. In contrast, the NADP/NADPH ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH.|$|E

25|$|Deductive {{reasoning}} {{concerns the}} logical consequence of given premises {{and is the}} form of reasoning most closely connected to logic. On a narrow conception of logic (see below) logic concerns just deductive reasoning, although such a narrow conception controversially excludes most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> informal logic from the discipline.|$|E
25|$|Cartesian dualism and Popper's three {{worlds are}} two forms <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> {{epistemological}} pluralism, {{that is the}} notion that different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include psychophysical parallelism and epiphenomenalism. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is not reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.|$|E

25|$|Resins: Valued since antiquity, resins {{have been}} widely used in incense and perfumery. Highly {{fragrant}} and antiseptic resins and resin-containing perfumes have been used by many cultures as medicines for a large variety of ailments. Commonly used resins in perfumery include labdanum, frankincense/olibanum, myrrh, balsam of Peru, benzoin. Pine and fir resins are a particularly valued source of terpenes used in the organic synthesis of many other synthetic or naturally occurring aromatic compounds. Some <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> amber and copal in perfumery today is the resinous secretion of fossil conifers.|$|E
25|$|The bass guitar often {{plays the}} {{dominant}} role in reggae, and the drum and bass {{is often the}} most important part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called,</b> in Jamaican music, a riddim (rhythm), a (usually simple) piece of music that's used repeatedly by different artists to write and record songs with. Literally hundreds of reggae singers have released different songs recorded over the same rhythm. The central role of the bass can be particularly heard in dub music — which gives an even bigger role to the drum and bass line, reducing the vocals and other instruments to peripheral roles.|$|E

25|$|In 550BC, Cyrus the Great, {{the son of}} Mandane and Cambyses I, {{took over}} the Median Empire, and founded the Achaemenid Empire by unifying other city states. The conquest of Media was a result <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> the Persian Revolt. The brouhaha was {{initially}} triggered {{by the actions of}} Median ruler Astyages, and was quickly spread to other provinces, as they allied with the Persians. Later conquests under Cyrus and his successors expanded the empire to include Lydia, Babylon, Egypt, parts of the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper, as well as the lands {{to the west of the}} Indus and Oxus rivers.|$|E
25|$|Whilst under construction, the TVR {{was bought}} by the London and Birmingham Railway (L) on 15 April 1846, the L itself amalgamating with other {{railways}} to form the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) on 16 July 1846. The Trent Valley line was opened to a limited service of local passenger trains and through goods trains on 15 September 1847, to local goods trains on 20 October 1847 (the delay due to the goods-handling facilities at the stations not being completed) and finally to all through traffic on 1 December 1847. It is now part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> the West Coast Main Line.|$|E
25|$|The river {{has been}} dammed {{numerous}} times, {{primarily in the}} 20th century by Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) projects since the 1930s. The placement of TVA's Kentucky Dam on the Tennessee River and the Corps of Engineers' Barkley Dam on the Cumberland River {{led to the development}} of associated lakes, and the creation <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> Land Between the Lakes. A navigation canal located at Grand Rivers, Kentucky, links Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley. The canal allows for a shorter trip for river traffic going from the Tennessee to most of the Ohio River, and for traffic going down the Cumberland River toward the Mississippi.|$|E

25|$|The themes {{expressed}} in gold or ceramics {{show that the}} various communities in these areas were politically and religiously related. The designs on textiles and clay baskets, the female clay figurines, {{and the construction of}} the burial mounds were similar for all the people of these river valleys. Like the channel system, which remained in use for many centuries, these cultural features lasted a long time and are part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> the Zenú tradition. Artisans from different localities in the area, however, expressed these ideas in their own way, making it possible to distinguish between them. Nevertheless, they showed a common Zenú identity.|$|E
25|$|Half {{of member}} states—14 out of 28—are {{parliamentary}} republics, while seven states are constitutional monarchies, meaning {{they have a}} monarch although political powers are exercised by elected politicians. Most republics and all the monarchies operate a parliamentary system whereby {{the head of state}} (president or monarch) has a largely ceremonial role with reserve powers. That means most power is in the hands <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> in most of those countries the prime minister, who is accountable to the national parliament. Of the remaining republics, five operate a semi-presidential system, where competencies are shared between the president and prime minister, while one republic operates a presidential system, where the president is head of state and government.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} some {{theoretical}} circumstances where {{the end result is}} infinity. One example is the singularity in the description of black holes. Some solutions of the equations of the general theory of relativity allow for finite mass distributions of zero size, and thus infinite density. This is an example <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> a mathematical singularity, or a point where a physical theory breaks down. This {{does not necessarily mean that}} physical infinities exist; it may mean simply that the theory is incapable of describing the situation properly. Two other examples occur in inverse-square force laws of the gravitational force equation of Newtonian gravity and Coulomb's law of electrostatics. Atr=0 these equations evaluate to infinities.|$|E

25|$|George Whitefield Chadwick (November 13, 1854 – April 4, 1931) was an American composer. Along with Horatio Parker, Amy Beach, Arthur Foote, and Edward MacDowell, {{he was a}} {{representative}} composer <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> the Second New England School of American composers of the late 19th century—the generation before Charles Ives. Chadwick's works {{are influenced by the}} Realist movement in the arts, characterized by a down-to-earth depiction of people's lives. Many consider his music to portray a distinctively American style. His works included several operas, three symphonies, five string quartets, tone poems, incidental music, songs and choral anthems. Along with a group of other composers collectively known as the Boston Six, Chadwick was one of those responsible for the first significant body of concert music by composers from the United States. The other five were Amy Beach, Arthur Foote, Edward MacDowell, John Knowles Paine, and Horatio Parker.|$|E

25|$|A state's {{exclusive}} {{economic zone}} starts at the seaward edge of its territorial sea and extends outward to a distance of 200 nautical miles (370.4km) from the baseline. The {{exclusive economic zone}} stretches much further into sea than the territorial waters, which end at 12 nmi (22km) from the coastal baseline (if following the rules {{set out in the}} UN Convention on the Law of the Sea). Thus, the exclusive economic zones includes the contiguous zone. States also have rights to the seabed <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> the continental shelf up to 350 nautical miles (648km) from the coastal baseline, beyond the exclusive economic zones, but such areas are not part of their exclusive economic zones. The legal definition of the continental shelf does not directly correspond to the geological meaning of the term, as it also includes the continental rise and slope, and the entire seabed within the exclusive economic zone.|$|E
