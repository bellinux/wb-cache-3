A ban on women wearing the hijab {{was introduced by}} the IFAB in 2007, but lifted in 2012 after pressure from Prince Ali <b>of</b> <b>Jordan.</b> In keeping with French views, the French Football Federation said it would maintain its ban.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Of</b> <b>Jordans</b> {{literary}} output, twelve poems survive. They include eleven cansos and one tenso (and {{possibly a}} sirventes).

[...] The melody <b>of</b> <b>Jordans</b> Vas vos soplei, domna, premieramen also survives. It was copied by the later troubadour Peire Cardenal for his Rics homs que greu ditz vertat e leu men. The most recent modern edition of his works is Il trovatore Raimon Jordan edited by Stefano Asperti (Modena: Mucchi, 1990).|$|R

NY317 then intersects with Whiting Road (CR183), which heads to the east, before entering the village <b>of</b> <b>Jordan.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{capital city}} <b>of</b> <b>Jordan</b> is Amman, located in north-central Jordan. Jordan {{is divided into}} 12 governorates (muhafazah) (informally grouped into three regions: northern, central, southern).

5|$|The {{scope of}} the Christianization mission in its early phase was quite limited geographically, and the few relics that have survived come from Gniezno Land. Stone churches and baptisteries were {{discovered}} within the Ostrów Lednicki and Poznań gords, and a chapel in Gniezno. Poznań was also {{the site of the}} first cathedral, the bishopric seat <b>of</b> <b>Jordan</b> and Bishop Unger, who followed him.|$|E
5|$|Abu Iyad {{appointed}} Abu Nidal in 1968 as the Fatah {{representative in}} Khartoum, Sudan, then (at Abu Nidal's insistence) {{to the same}} position in Baghdad in July 1970, two months before Black September, when over 10 days of fighting King Hussein's army drove the Palestinian fedayeen out <b>of</b> <b>Jordan,</b> {{with the loss of}} thousands of lives. Seale writes that Abu Nidal's absence from Jordan during this period, when it was clear that King Hussein was about to act against the Palestinians, raised suspicion within the movement that Abu Nidal was interested only in saving himself.|$|E

5|$|According to Jordan Department of Statistics, Amman has {{the highest}} {{literacy}} percentage in Jordan: 95.2% (97.3% among males and 93.1% among females). There are 20 universities in Amman. The University <b>of</b> <b>Jordan</b> is the largest public university in the city. There are 448 private schools in the city attended by 90,000 students, including Amman Baccalaureate School, Amman Academy, Amman National School, Modern American School, International School of Choueifat, American Community School in Amman and National Orthodox School.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} stylistic {{influence was}} the experimental oeuvre of Kenneth Anger, {{and in particular}} Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome. Noé saw Anger's films in the early 1990s, while promoting the short film Carne, and quickly became a fan. Other influences from experimental cinema included the works <b>of</b> <b>Jordan</b> Belson and Peter Tscherkassky. Noé's favourite film, , was the most prominent influence among mainstream films; Noé {{wanted to become a}} filmmaker after he saw it at the age of seven. Brian De Palma's Snake Eyes and other films which feature hovering overhead shots inspired Noé to make a film largely from such a perspective.|$|E
5|$|Captain Sharif Ali bin Zeid, 34, a Jordanian {{military}} intelligence officer, {{was killed in}} the attack. He was the Jordanian handler of al-Balawi and the liaison between him and the CIA. Bin Zeid was a cousin to King Abdullah II <b>of</b> <b>Jordan.</b> Bin Zeid's wake was held in the Royal Palace. King Abdullah II and Queen Rania attended his funeral. Official Jordanian news reports said that he died while performing humanitarian service in Afghanistan. His death shed light on the U.S.-Jordanian intelligence partnership, which is rarely acknowledged publicly, yet seen by U.S. officials as highly important for their counter-terrorism strategy.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, Chandler confronted {{his ex-wife}} June, who had custody <b>of</b> <b>Jordan,</b> with suspicions that their {{son had been}} in an {{inappropriate}} relationship with Jackson but June dismissed his worries.

Rothman, called psychiatrist Mathis Abrams and reported a situation of sexual molestation mirroring what his son had alleged.|$|E
5|$|In Jordan, NY317 becomes Elbridge Street {{and turns}} west to {{intersect}} the northern terminus of Valley Drive. The highway proceeds through the southern {{portion of the}} village and crosses Skaneateles Creek to reach a junction with South Main Street. NY317 turns north onto Main Street and has intersections with Mechanic Street (CR60) and North Hamilton Street (designated as CR271 south <b>of</b> <b>Jordan)</b> before it terminates at a junction with NY31 north of the village center but within the village limits.|$|E
5|$|In July 1922, the British Mandate of Palestine was created.

This instead became a separate country known as the Hashemite Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Jordan.</b>|$|E

40|$|Inspired by {{the work}} of Benson, Carlson, Friedlander, Pevtsova, and Suslin on modules <b>of</b> {{constant}} <b>Jordan</b> type for finite group schemes, we introduce in this paper the class of representations <b>of</b> constant <b>Jordan</b> type for an acyclic quiver Q. We do this by first assigning to an arbitrary finite-dimensional representation of Q a sequence of coherent sheaves on moduli spaces of thin representations. Next, we show that our quiver representations <b>of</b> constant <b>Jordan</b> type are precisely those representations for which the corresponding sheaves are locally free. We also construct representations <b>of</b> constant <b>Jordan</b> type with desirable homological properties. Finally, we show that any element of Z^L, where L is the Loewy length of the path algebra of Q, can be realized as the <b>Jordan</b> type <b>of</b> a virtual representation of Q <b>of</b> relative constant <b>Jordan</b> type.
