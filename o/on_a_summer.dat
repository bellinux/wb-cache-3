The exact date was not disclosed, although mid-season transfer window in MLS opens on 15 July and closes 31 August.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> day, horses {{that belonged to}} the Monastery of StJovan Vladimir. When they came to the nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it {{appeared}} to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves realized that this was a miracle of the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{was asked}} to write a series called Riverboat, set in 1860s Mississippi. When he {{discovered}} that the producers wanted no black people on the show, he argued so much with them that he lost the job. He also considered moving to England around this time, as Sir Lew Grade of Associated Television wanted Roddenberry to develop series and set up his own production company. Though he did not move, he leveraged the deal to land a contract with Screen Gems that included a guaranteed $100,000, and became a producer {{for the first time}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> replacement for the Tennessee Ernie Ford Show titled Wrangler.|$|E

5|$|The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers {{is also a}} key {{symbolic}} element, leading Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffrey's troubles begin, {{the audience}} is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the canal of the severed, decomposing ear. Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the ear canal {{until the end of}} the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the ear canal shot is replayed, only in reverse, zooming out through Jeffrey's own ear as he relaxes in his yard <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> day.|$|E
5|$|A year later, in September 1911, Italy {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire. The two battleships and the ancient central battery ironclad —which had {{been built in the}} mid-1870s—had been <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> training cruise since July, and so were prepared for the conflict. On 1 October, shortly after the outbreak of war, Barbaros Hayreddin {{and the rest of the}} Ottoman fleet was moored at Beirut. The following day, the fleet departed for Constantinople for repairs in preparation to engage the Italian fleet. Nevertheless, the bulk of the Ottoman fleet, including Barbaros Hayreddin, remained in port for the duration of the war. By the end of the war, Barbaros Hayreddin and her sister were in very poor condition. Their rangefinders and the ammunition hoists for their main battery guns had been removed, their telephones did not work, and the pipes for their pumps were badly rusted. Most of the watertight doors could not close, and the condensers remained problematic.|$|E

25|$|Bala's Museum, {{located in}} Bala, Ontario, Canada, {{is a house}} museum {{established}} in 1992 and dedicated to Lucy M. Montgomery information and heritage.

25|$|Nantucket {{is served}} by Nantucket Memorial Airport (IATA airport code ACK), a three-runway airport {{on the south side}} of the island. The airport is one of the busiest in Massachusetts and often logs more take-offs and {{landings}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> day than Boston's Logan Airport. This is due in part to the large number of private planes used by wealthy summer inhabitants, and in part to the 10-seat Cessna 402s used by several commercial air carriers to serve the island community.|$|E

25|$|The 16th century Swedish writer Olaus Magnus {{says that}} the Livonian werewolves were {{initiated}} by draining a cup of specially prepared beer and repeating a set formula.

25|$|At {{the time}} he lived in Bath, and played once for Somerset in 1905, {{but it was clear}} from his failure then that he could no longer play serious cricket.

According to a number of sources (including Herbert Strudwick), he had been in good health and spirits before leaving England. A widespread rumour that he had committed suicide was disproved by research carried out by Ralph Barker. Richardson was buried in Richmond Cemetery.|$|E

In March 2008, Warrant announced on its official website that it would co-headline with Cinderella <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> reunion tour after Rocklahoma 2008. Ultimately, the tour was canceled after Cinderella singer Tom Keifer's left vocal cord hemorrhaged, making it impossible for him to sing in the immediate future.
