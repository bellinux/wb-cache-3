25|$|He {{is perhaps}} best known for his portraits, and his sitters {{including}} {{some of the most important}} men and women of his time. His portrait of painter Lydia Field Emmet in 1892 depicts Emmet in a pose typically reserved for men in old masters' paintings. Emmet's hand is <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> and she looks over her shoulder at the audience.|$|E
2500|$|John Marshall, another {{archeologist}} at Mohenjo-daro, {{described the}} figure as [...] "a young girl, her hand <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> in a half-impudent posture, and legs slightly forward as she beats {{time to the}} music with her legs and feet." [...] The archaeologist Gregory Possehl said of the statuette, [...] "We may not be certain {{that she was a}} dancer, but she was good at what she did and she knew it". The statue led to two important discoveries about the civilization: first, that they knew metal blending, casting and other sophisticated methods of working with ore, and secondly that entertainment, especially dance, was part of the culture.|$|E
2500|$|The parikrama {{passage in}} the sanctum {{features}} what Ali Javid and Tabassum Javeed call the [...] "most striking carvings of females in Khajuraho". One figure shows a surasundari playing a flute, with her body slightly bent sideways, exhibiting the contemporary ideal of the female body. Another figure, which is partially damaged, shows a damsel in a dancing pose. One sculpture shows a mother holding her baby: she is slightly bending sideways to let her baby sit <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip.</b> Another one shows a female lifting her left foot behind her, and applying dye on it. Yet another one shows a maiden trying to tie her bra behind her back, as the twisted body accentuates her curves.|$|E
60|$|Entering Manston's empty bedroom, with <b>her</b> hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> she indifferently {{cast her}} eyes upon the bed, {{previously}} to dismantling it.|$|R

6000|$|... "Tom McChesney," [...] said Polly Ann, with <b>her</b> hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> and <b>her</b> sunbonnet tilted, [...] "that's {{the longest}} speech you ever made in your life." ...|$|R
60|$|James {{approached}} Miss Forrester with {{a beating}} heart. She made a charming picture {{as she stood}} there in the sunlight, one hand <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> the other swaying a tennis racket.|$|E
60|$|And {{having said}} that she turned on her heel and slowly walked away, leaving behind her an ocean of desolation. She walked away--with a slow, {{swinging}} stride, one hand <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> her head thrown back.|$|E
60|$|A {{smile of}} triumph went over his face. Madame watched him stonily {{as she stood}} beside her chair, one hand lightly {{balanced}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip.</b> Alvina was reminded of Kishwégin. But even in Madame's stony mistrust there was an element of attraction towards him. He had taken his cigarette case from his pocket.|$|E
60|$|I {{enjoyed it}} so little, indeed, that I fell to poking the sitting-room fire {{when she entered}} with the Mercury; and read the Mercury assiduously while she brought in breakfast. She set down the tray with a slam and stood beside it, <b>her</b> hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> <b>her</b> whole {{attitude}} breathing challenge.|$|R
6000|$|She pointed {{dramatically}} at the door, but {{the woman}} retained her position, only moving to cuff the boy, who was kicking Henderson on his shins. Then, setting <b>her</b> hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> she said defiantly: ...|$|R
60|$|Bostil's sister came in {{from the}} kitchen. She was a huge person with a severe yet motherly face. She had <b>her</b> hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and she cast a rather disapproving glance at father and daughter.|$|R
60|$|At {{this change}} in his voice, Wolf lifted his head quickly, and still more quickly {{got to his feet}} when the man and woman shook hands. He sprang up on his hind legs, resting his fore paws <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> {{and at the same time}} licking Skiff Miller's hand. When the latter shook hands with Walt, Wolf {{repeated}} his act, resting his weight on Walt and licking both men's hands.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} {{they were all}} very stiff, but glad of the sun on {{sagebrush}} and river, and the boy and girl sang over breakfast. While Milt was gathering fuel {{he looked up at}} Claire standing against a background of rugged hills, her skirt and shoes still smug, but her jacket off, her blouse turned in at the throat, her hair blowing, her sleeves rolled up, one hand <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> erect, charged with vigor--the spirit of adventure.|$|E
6000|$|The mare {{walked up}} the sharp little rise on top of which stood the [...] "Ram Inn." [...] In the quiet, as the horse slowed to a standstill, we heard the crooning of a song in the garden. We sat still in the cart, and looked across the flagged yard to where the tall madonna lilies rose in {{clusters}} out of the alyssome. Beyond the border of flowers was Meg, bending over the gooseberry bushes. She saw us and came swinging down the path, {{with a bowl of}} gooseberries poised <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip.</b> She was dressed in a plain, fresh holland frock, with a white apron. Her black, heavy hair reflected the sunlight, and her ripe face was luxuriant with laughter.|$|E
60|$|The younger lady {{looked down}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> {{companion}} with {{something of the}} calm expert attention that a plumber gives to a tap that is misbehaving, and like a plumber refrained from precipitate action. She stood with the backs of <b>her</b> hands resting <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He came {{in about}} five minutes ago," [...] said the furmity woman, joining the rest with <b>her</b> hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> [...] "And then 'a stepped back, and then 'a looked in again. I'm not a penny the better for him." ...|$|R
60|$|She had {{nodded to}} Andor, but by tacit consent {{they had not}} shaken hands. Klara now put <b>her</b> hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and, like a young animal let free after days of captivity, she drew in deep breaths of sweet-scented air.|$|R
60|$|The woman--or girl, rather, he decided--walked {{along the}} veranda toward him. The two men {{waited at the}} head of the steps, {{watching}} curiously. The girl was angry; he could see that. Her gray eyes were flashing, and her lips were quivering. That she had a temper, was his thought. But the eyes were striking. He decided that they were not gray after all, or, at least, not all gray. They were large and wide apart, and they looked at him from under level brows. Her face was cameo-like, so clear cut was it. There were other striking things about her--the cowboy Stetson hat, the heavy braids of brown hair, and the long-barrelled 38 Colt's revolver that hung in its holster <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mademoiselle {{had come}} in and watched them for a moment. She saw at once what was needed, and as Mrs. Fletcher {{was one of her}} best patrons, she was glad to oblige the oldest daughter; so she went to the piano and struck up the proper air just as Jessie, with one arm <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> the other on the {{shoulder}} of an invisible partner, went down the hall with a martial stamp, a quick slide, and a graceful turn, in perfect time to the stirring music that made her nerves tingle and her feet fly. To and fro, round and round, with all manner of graceful gestures, intricate steps, and active bounds went the happy girl, quite carried away by the music and motion of the pastime she loved so much.|$|E
60|$|She nerved {{herself by}} an effort, entered the swing-gate, and rang the door-bell. The thing was done; {{there could be}} no retreat. No; the thing was not done. Nobody {{answered}} to her ringing. The effort had to be risen to and made again. She rang a second time, and the agitation of the act, coupled with her weariness after the fifteen miles' walk, led her support herself while she waited by resting her hand <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> and her elbow {{against the wall of the}} porch. The wind was so nipping that the ivy-leaves had become wizened and gray, each tapping incessantly upon its neighbour with a disquieting stir of her nerves. A piece of blood-stained paper, caught up from some meat-buyer's dust-heap, beat up and down the road without the gate; too flimsy to rest, too heavy to fly away; and a few straws kept it company.|$|E
60|$|She stood {{blocking}} up the doorway with <b>her</b> 'ands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>'ips,</b> while I explained, with Kumbo still 'anging {{on my arm}} and a crowd collecting behind, and the more I explained, the more I could see she didn't believe a word of it.|$|R
60|$|The moment I {{opened the}} door I see there was {{something}} wrong. Three times my missis licked 'er lips afore she could speak. Her face 'ad gone a dirty white colour, and she was leaning forward with <b>her</b> 'ands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>'ips,</b> trembling all over with temper.|$|R
60|$|Elaine--she {{had this}} poetic name--fingered her cat timidly, {{not knowing what}} to say or to do, unable even to ask her visitor to sit down. He noticed how her skirt hung almost flat <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> She was young, scarce developed, a long, slender thing. Her {{colouring}} was warm and exquisite.|$|R
60|$|In {{these and}} a {{thousand}} ways Sheldon was made aware of how much he was indebted for material prosperity to Joan--to the slender, level-browed girl with romance shining out of her gray eyes and adventure shouting from the long-barrelled Colt's <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> who had landed on the beach that piping gale, along with her stalwart Tahitian crew, and who had entered his bungalow to hang with boy's hands her revolver-belt and Baden- Powell hat on the nail by the billiard table. He forgot all the early exasperations, remembering only her charms and sweetnesses and glorying much in the traits he at first had disliked most--her boyishness and adventurousness, her delight to swim and risk the sharks, her desire to go recruiting, her love {{of the sea and}} ships, her sharp authoritative words when she launched the whale-boat and, with firestick in one hand and dynamite-stick in the other, departed with her picturesque crew to shoot fish in the Balesuna; her super-innocent disdain for the commonest conventions, her juvenile joy in argument, her fluttering, wild-bird love of freedom and mad passion for independence. All this he now loved, and he no longer desired to tame and hold her, though the paradox was the winning of her without the taming and the holding.|$|E
60|$|Madame Bouclet now {{traced the}} line with her forefinger, as it were to confirm and settle herself in her parting snap at Monsieur Mutuel, and so placing her right hand <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> with a defiant air, as if nothing should ever tempt her to unsnap that snap, strolled out into the Place to glance up at the windows of Mr. The Englishman. That worthy {{happening}} to be looking out of window at the moment, Madame Bouclet gave him a graceful salutation with her head, looked {{to the right and}} looked to the left to account to him for her being there, considered for a moment, like one who accounted to herself for somebody she had expected not being there, and reentered her own gateway. Madame Bouclet let all her house giving on the Place in furnished flats or floors, and lived up the yard behind in company with Monsieur Bouclet her husband (great at billiards), an inherited brewing business, several fowls, two carts, a nephew, a little dog in a big kennel, a grape-vine, a counting-house, four horses, a married sister (with a share in the brewing business), the husband and two children of the married sister, a parrot, a drum (performed on by the little boy of the married sister), two billeted soldiers, a quantity of pigeons, a fife (played by the nephew in a ravishing manner), several domestics and supernumeraries, a perpetual flavour of coffee and soup, a terrific range of artificial rocks and wooden precipices at least four feet high, a small fountain, and half-a-dozen large sunflowers.|$|E
60|$|But let me not so hasten {{over this}} part of my friend's journey as to omit all mention of the amphibious Irish houses which stand about on the low lands along the railroad-sides, and which you half expect to see plunge into the tidal mud of the neighborhood, {{with a series of}} hoarse croaks, as the train approaches. Perhaps twenty-four trains pass those houses every twenty-four hours, and it is a wonder that the {{inhabitants}} keep their interest in them, or have leisure to bestow upon any of them. Yet, as you dash along so bravely, you can see that you arrest the occupations of all these villagers as by a kind of enchantment; the children pause and turn their heads toward you from their mud-pies (to the production of which there is literally no limit in that region); the matron rests one parboiled hand <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> letting the other still linger listlessly upon the wash-board, while she lifts her eyes from the suds to look at you; the boys, who all summer long are forever just going into the water or just coming out of it, cease their buttoning or unbuttoning; the baby, which has been run after and caught and suitably posed, turns its anguished eyes upon you, where also falls the mother's gaze, while her descending palm is arrested in mid air. I forbear to comment upon the surprising populousness of these villages, where, in obedience to all the laws of health, the inhabitants ought to be wasting miserably away, but where they flourish in spite of them. Even Accident here seems to be robbed of half her malevolence; and that baby (who will presently be chastised with terrific uproar) passes an infancy of intrepid enjoyment amidst the local perils, and is no more affected by the engines and the cars than by so many fretful hens with their attendant broods of chickens.|$|E
50|$|Using {{data from}} the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, William Lassek at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and Steven Gaulin of the University of California, Santa Barbara, found a child's {{performance}} in cognitive tests correlated to their mother's waist-hip ratio, a proxy for how much fat she stores <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b>|$|R
