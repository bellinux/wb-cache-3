A <b>thermal</b> <b>switch</b> is a system to control the heat {{transfer}} "on/off" for the desired functionalities, and this serves as a basic building block to design advanced thermal management systems in various applications including electronic packaging, waste heat recovery, cryogenic cooling, and new applications such as thermal computers. The existing <b>thermal</b> <b>switches</b> employ the macroscale mechanical-based, relatively slow transient "on/off" switch mechanisms, which may be challenging to provide solutions for micro/nanoscale applications. In this study, a fast and efficient <b>thermal</b> <b>switch</b> mechanism without having extra mechanical controlling system is demonstrated using gas-filled, heterogeneous nanogaps with asymmetric surface interactions in Knudsen regime. Argon gas atoms confined in metal-based solid surfaces are employed to predict the degree of <b>thermal</b> <b>switch,</b> S. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation is used to create the temperature gradient over the two nanogaps, and the maximum degree of <b>thermal</b> <b>switch</b> is S-max similar to 13, which results from the difference in adsorption-controlled thermal accommodation coefficient (TAC) and pressure {{between the two sides}} of the gaps.

Lappo from NII-885, the Moscow Electronics Research Institute, that worked on two frequencies, 20.005 and 40.002MHz. Signals {{on the first}} frequency were transmitted in 0.3 sec pulses (under normal temperature and pressure conditions on-board), with pauses of the same duration filled by pulses on the second frequency. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere. Temperature and pressure were encoded in the duration of radio beeps. A temperature regulation system contained a fan, a dual <b>thermal</b> <b>switch,</b> and a control <b>thermal</b> <b>switch.</b> If the temperature inside the satellite exceeded [...] the fan was turned on and when it fell below [...] the fan was {{turned off by the}} dual <b>thermal</b> <b>switch.</b> If the temperature exceeded [...] or fell below , another control <b>thermal</b> <b>switch</b> was activated, changing the duration of the radio signal pulses.

40|$|A {{bistable}} {{switching element}} {{is made of}} a material whose electrical resistance reversibly decreases in response to intercalation by positive ions. Flow of positive ions between the bistable switching element and a positive ion source is controlled {{by means of an}} electrical potential applied across a <b>thermal</b> <b>switching</b> element. The material of the <b>thermal</b> <b>switching</b> element generates heat in response to electrical current flow therethrough, which in turn causes the material to undergo a thermal phase transition from a high electrical resistance state to a low electrical resistance state as the temperature increases above a predetermined value. Application of the electrical potential in one direction renders the <b>thermal</b> <b>switching</b> element conductive to pass electron current out of the ion source. This causes positive ions to flow from the source into the bistable switching element and intercalate the same to produce a non-volatile, low resistance logic state.

40|$|Abstract Background Recently, a novel single-switch access {{technology}} {{based on}} infrared thermography was proposed. The technology exploits the temperature {{differences between the}} inside and surrounding areas of the mouth as a switch trigger, thereby allowing voluntary switch activation upon mouth opening. However, for this technology to be clinically viable, it must be validated against a gold standard switch, such as a chin switch, that taps into the same voluntary motion. Methods In this study, we report an experiment designed to gauge the concurrent validity of the infrared <b>thermal</b> <b>switch.</b> Ten able-bodied adults participated {{in a series of}} 3 test sessions where they simultaneously used both an infrared thermal and conventional chin switch to perform multiple trials of a number identification task with visual, auditory and audiovisual stimuli. Participants also provided qualitative feedback about switch use. User performance with the two switches was quantified using an efficiency measure based on mutual information. Results User performance (p = 0. 16) and response time (p = 0. 25) with the infrared <b>thermal</b> <b>switch</b> were comparable to those of the gold standard. Users reported preference for the infrared <b>thermal</b> <b>switch</b> given its non-contact nature and robustness to changes in user posture.
