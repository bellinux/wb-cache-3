5|$|A topological <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> a {{directed}} graph is an <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> its vertices into a sequence, such {{that for every}} edge the start vertex of the edge occurs earlier in the sequence than the ending vertex of the edge.|$|E
5|$|As the {{guarantor}} of justice, the Roman emperor {{was expected to}} devote substantial amounts of time to judicial matters. He was the chief magistrate whose major prerogative (jus) was the <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> all public affairs, for which he could demand assistance from anyone at any time.|$|E
5|$|DAGs can model many {{different}} kinds of information. A spreadsheet can be modeled as a DAG, with a vertex for each cell and an edge whenever the formula in one cell uses the value from another; a topological <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> this DAG can be used to update all cell values when the spreadsheet is changed.|$|E

5|$|Many other {{biological}} structures exhibit liquid-crystal behavior. For instance, the concentrated {{protein solution}} that is extruded by a spider to generate silk is, in fact, a liquid crystal phase.

5|$|Testing the {{existence}} of a three-page book embedding of a graph, given a fixed <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> the vertices along the spine of the embedding, has unknown computational complexity: it is neither known to be solvable in polynomial time nor known to be NP-hard. And, although every planar graph has book thickness at most four, it is unknown whether there exists a planar graph whose book thickness is exactly four.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson was published. Using the {{physical}} evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended {{to be published in}} their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets. Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.|$|E

5|$|One {{consequence}} of this fact appears in the bit-reversed <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> integer data types used by some computer algorithms, such as the Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform. This ordering has the property that the farther to the left the first 1 occurs in a number's binary expansion, or the more times it is divisible by 2, the sooner it appears. Zero's bit reversal is still zero; it can be divided by 2 any number of times, and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s, so it always comes first.|$|E
5|$|Since Warhol gave no {{indication}} of a definitive <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> the collection, the sequence chosen by MoMA (in the picture at the upper right of this article) in the display from their permanent collection reflects the chronological order in which the varieties were introduced by the Campbell Soup Company, beginning with Tomato in the upper left, which debuted in 1897. By April 2011, the curators at the MoMA had reordered the varieties, moving Clam Chowder to the upper left and tomato {{to the bottom of}} the four rows.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> liquid {{crystalline}} phases is extensive on {{the molecular}} scale. This order extends {{up to the}} entire domain size, which {{may be on the}} order of micrometers, but usually does not extend to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical crystalline solids. However some techniques, {{such as the use of}} boundaries or an applied electric field, can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample. The ordering in a liquid crystal might extend along only one dimension, with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} was dated c. 1446 by Wolfgang Schöne in the 1930s, mainly by matching {{the style and}} fashion of her clothing to contemporary trends. In the early 20th century the dating and authorship of works then attributed to Christus were challenged. Max Friedländer proposed a number of dates and an <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> works in the 1957 volume of his Early Netherlandish painting, but many of his assumptions were discounted by Otto Pächt {{just a few years}} later.|$|E
5|$|Thermotropic phases {{are those}} that occur in a certain {{temperature}} range. If the temperature rise is too high, thermal motion will destroy the delicate cooperative <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> the LC phase, pushing the material into a conventional isotropic liquid phase. At too low temperature, most LC materials will form a conventional crystal. Many thermotropic LCs exhibit a variety of phases as temperature is changed. For instance, on heating {{a particular type of}} LC molecule (called mesogen) may exhibit various smectic phases followed by the nematic phase and finally the isotropic phase as temperature is increased. An example of a compound displaying thermotropic LC behavior is para-azoxyanisole.|$|E
5|$|At Parc Cwm long cairn {{a variety}} of {{mortuary}} practices was evident and the deliberate <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> skeletal parts noticeable. Whittle and Wysocki (1998) note cremated human remains were placed only in the front, right (southeast) chamber, where females and males, and all age ranges were represented. The southeast chamber was also unusual in that it contained nearly {{three times as many}} individuals as in each of the other chambers, which contained the remains of all representative groups except younger children and infants. At the forecourt entrance Atkinson recorded finds, deposited in groups, including: flint debitage, lithic cores and a bladelet (burnt and unburnt); a leaf-shaped arrowhead (burnt); pieces of quartz; pieces of stalactite (now missing); sherds of Neolithic pottery; and cremated bone fragments. Atkinson speculated that the stalactite originated from Cat Hole cave, which (along with Tooth Hole cave) Whittle and Wysocki note as a possible source of the quartz too.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} also {{released}} in the United States, by the New York branch of Méliès's company. During the summer of 1905, Klaw & Erlanger showed it at the Aerial Gardens, on the rooftop of the New Amsterdam Theatre. In the American release, the scenes were slightly rearranged: {{the first and second}} scenes were switched in order, as were the sixth and seventh. In addition, because of a renumbering, ten tableaux were advertised instead of the French catalogue's twelve, although no scenes were removed. (The two prints of the film surviving in the Méliès family's archive, the Cinémathèque Méliès, use the French <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> the scenes.) Another discrepancy between the French and American catalogues occurs for political reasons: the American catalog specifies that the protagonist is King Leopold, but the French one keeps the identity anonymous, so as not to offend Belgian audiences. Similarly, the Alps in the film are named as such in the American catalog but are unnamed in the French one.|$|E
5|$|The fourth Book of the Vishnu Purana (between the 1st century BCE to the 4th century CE) {{also tells}} the story. However, Keshi first {{appears in the}} episode when Kamsa calls the host of demons to kill all male children, once he realizes Krishna is born. Chapters 15 and 16 of the fourth Book {{presents}} {{a detailed account of}} Keshi's death which parallels the Bhagavata Purana account. The narrative of Arishta's death, Narada's disclosure to Kamsa and the subsequent <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> Keshi is the same. Though the terror by Keshi on earth and sky and Krishna's challenge is the same, the fight starts directly with Keshi attacking Krishna with his opened mouth. The hand of Krishna choking Keshi at the same time, tearing his body into two halves. The splitting of Keshi's body is not told in the Bhagavata Purana. Narada's eulogy and prophesy about Kamsa's death follows the account, where Narada decreed that Krishna would be called Keshava, the slayer of Keshi.|$|E
5|$|Topological sorting is the {{algorithmic}} {{problem of}} finding a topological <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> a given DAG. It can be solved in linear time. Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting builds the vertex ordering directly. It maintains a list of vertices that have no incoming edges from other vertices that have not already {{been included in the}} partially constructed topological ordering; initially this list consists of the vertices with no incoming edges at all. Then, it repeatedly adds one vertex from this list {{to the end of the}} partially constructed topological ordering, and checks whether its neighbors should be added to the list. The algorithm terminates when all vertices have been processed in this way. Alternatively, a topological ordering may be constructed by reversing a postorder numbering of a depth-first search graph traversal.|$|E
