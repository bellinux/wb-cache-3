500|$|In Moonwalk (1988), Jackson {{said his}} {{relationship}} with Shields was [...] "romantically serious for a while." [...] Shields said that while never formally proposing, he would speak about the two marrying and raising adoptive children together. The suggestions were met with disapproval from Shields, who felt {{such a move would}} have [...] "divided [...] life too much". She recalled: [...] "There were times when he would ask me to marry him, and I would say, 'You have {{me for the rest of}} your life, you don’t need to marry me, I’m going to go on...have my own marriage and my <b>own</b> <b>kids,</b> and you’ll always have me.' I think it made him relax. He didn’t want to lose things that meant something to him." ...|$|E
500|$|Pauline {{is shown}} to be {{particularly}} hostile to the various female characters that feature in her sons' lives, and she epitomises the archetypal [...] "mother-in-law from hell". One of Pauline's most notable feuds is with her youngest son Martin's wife, Sonia. Animosity between the characters begins in 2000, when Sonia gives birth to Pauline's grandchild and decides to give the baby Chloe (later renamed Rebecca) up for adoption. In the storyline, Pauline tries unsuccessfully to fight for custody, leading Sonia to retort [...] "YOU want to bring up Chloe? You couldn't bring up phlegm!" [...] The feuding over Chloe is revisited in storylines throughout 2005 and 2006, when first Pauline {{is shown to}} visit her adopted granddaughter against Sonia and Martin's wishes, and then, following Sonia's affair with Naomi Julien, Pauline refuses to give Sonia access to the child after Martin regains custody. Critic for The Guardian, Grace Dent, commented [...] "At one point, you couldn't move around Walford for hitmen and gangsters, but now they've all been written out... leaving Pauline Fowler to reign the square like sodding Pablo Escobar in a sky-blue tabard and ski-pants, decreeing who can see their <b>own</b> <b>kids,</b> who can drink where and what everyone's eating in the cafe so as they won't spoil their teas. If I was Sonia, I'd have ransacked the hospital's dangerous drugs box by now and given that old crone a renal meltdown." [...] Various rows, slaps and insults were featured between the characters, caused by Pauline's continuous interference in Sonia's relationships with Martin and Rebecca. As Martin began to cede, allowing Sonia access to their daughter, Pauline was shown to concoct ever more elaborate ways to obstruct Sonia's involvement.|$|E

Showing a softer side, Sue visits Santana's grandmother who doesn't believe in two women marrying and uses [...] "some reverse Suecology" [...] to get the woman to see {{that no matter what}} she believes, family is most important. Sue is then allowed to attend the wedding and helps convince Kurt Hummel and Blaine Anderson to marry alongside Brittany and Santana, providing the rings for them when they don't have any. Sue later provides the two couples with their dream honeymoons, telling them that despite how she's treated them over the years, she's come to see them like her <b>own</b> <b>kids.</b>|$|E
2500|$|While {{traveling}} on his tour bus with the Four Tops on May 15, 1969, Four Tops member Renaldo [...] "Obie" [...] Benson witnessed {{an act of}} police brutality and violence committed on anti-war protesters who had been protesting at Berkeley's People's Park in what was later termed as [...] "Bloody Thursday". A disgusted Benson later told author Ben Edmonds, [...] "I saw this and started wondering 'what was going on, what is happening here?' One question led to another. Why are they sending kids far away from their families overseas? Why are they attacking their <b>own</b> <b>kids</b> in the street?" [...] Returning to Detroit, Motown songwriter Al Cleveland wrote and composed a song based on his conversations with Benson {{of what he had}} seen in Berkeley. Benson sent the unfinished song to his bandmates but the other Four Tops turned the song down. Benson said, [...] "My partners told me it was a protest song. I said 'no man it's a love song, about love and understanding. I'm not protesting. I want to know what's going on.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|With Prisoner of Azkaban, {{production}} of the Harry Potter films switched to an eighteen-month cycle, which producer David Heyman explained was [...] "to give each [...] the time it required." [...] Chris Columbus, {{the director of the}} previous two films, decided not to return to helm the third instalment as he [...] "hadn't seen [...] <b>own</b> <b>kids</b> for supper in the week for {{about two and a half}} years." [...] Even so, he remained on as a producer alongside Heyman. Guillermo del Toro was approached to direct, but considered the film [...] "so bright and happy and full of light, that [...] wasn't interested." [...] Marc Forster turned down the film because he had made Finding Neverland and did not want to direct child actors again. M. Night Shyamalan was considered to direct but turned it down because he was working on his own film, The Village. Warner Bros. then composed a three-name short list for Columbus's replacement, which comprised Callie Khouri, Kenneth Branagh (who played Gilderoy Lockhart in Chamber of Secrets) and eventual selection Alfonso Cuarón. Cuarón was initially nervous about accepting as he had not read any of the books, or seen the films. After reading the series, he changed his mind and signed on to direct, as he had immediately connected to the story. Cuarón's appointment pleased J. K. Rowling who loved his film Y Tu Mamá También and was impressed with his adaptation of A Little Princess. Heyman found that [...] "tonally and stylistically, [...] was the perfect fit." [...] As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Cuarón assigned Radcliffe, Grint and Watson to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character's emotional experience. Of Rupert Grint's essay, Cuarón recalls, [...] "Rupert didn't deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn't do it, he said, 'I'm Ron; Ron wouldn't do it.' So I said, 'Okay, you do understand your character.' That was the most important piece of acting work that we did on Prisoner of Azkaban, because it was very clear that everything they put in those essays was going to be the pillars they were going to hold on to for the rest of the process." ...|$|E
