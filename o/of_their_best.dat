5|$|As {{an obsessive}} new mother {{who has spent}} many an hour {{hovering}} over my son with a thermometer and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't {{want to go out}} for dinner with Adam because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew in the care <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> friend's children's nanny was just one niggling implausibility too far. After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E
5|$|As {{speculation}} of {{a move to}} Hibernian came {{to nothing}} (despite his being installed as the bookmaker's favourite), Gannon instead was confirmed as manager of Scottish Premier League side Motherwell {{at the end of}} June 2009, two days before the club's Europa League first round qualifying tie against Llanelli of Wales. To do this he fended off competition from Aidy Boothroyd, Lawrie Sanchez, and Steve Staunton. At the start of his reign he had a limited squad, and had to draft in youth players for the Llanelli game. The club had sold off some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> players, whilst loan deals had ended for others. He also brought in Peter Ward as assistant manager.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, an up-start league was created, the Players' League(PL), {{which drew}} many players away from teams {{from both the}} AA and NL teams. The Browns lost a few <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> players as well, {{including}} Comiskey, their player-manager, and King, the team's top pitcher. Chamberlain re-signed with the team, but he was sold to the Columbus Solons after pitching in just five games. These movements left Stivetts and Toad Ramsey as the franchise's top two starters, with rookie Billy Hart cast as the occasional relief starter.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, three of the Bruins' best forwards decided to join the Royal Canadian Air Force midway through the 1941–42 season. These three forwards made up the Kraut Line, {{one of the best}} lines in the NHL. Despite missing three <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> players, the Bruins managed to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals the next season. In the finals, they were eliminated by the Red Wings, four games to none. Due to his play in the regular season, Brimsek was again named to the NHL Second All-Star Team. However, it was popular opinion at the time that Brimsek deserved the spot on the First All-Star Team over Johnny Mowers, including Mowers' own coach and general manager, Jack Adams.|$|E
5|$|In March 1962 the Blue Boys {{read about}} the Ealing Jazz Club in Jazz News newspaper, which {{mentioned}} Alexis Korner's rhythm and blues band, Blues Incorporated.

The Romans were defeated in a small battle and they retreated. The Romans then won another battle against the Spartans and forced them to retreat into the city.|$|E

5|$|The Kaqchikel kept up {{resistance}} against the Spanish {{for a number}} of years, but on 9 May 1530, exhausted by the warfare that had seen the deaths <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> warriors and the enforced abandonment of their crops, the two kings of the most important clans returned from the wilds. A day later they were joined by many nobles and their families and many more people; they then surrendered at the new Spanish capital at Ciudad Vieja. The former inhabitants of Iximche were dispersed; some were moved to Tecpán, the rest to Sololá and other towns around Lake Atitlán.|$|E
5|$|The aborigines signalled their {{surrender}} {{by sending}} a few <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> weapons to the Dutch, and then by bringing a small tree (often betel nut) planted in earth from their village as a token of the granting of sovereignty to the VOC. Over {{the next few months}} as word of the Dutch victory spread, more and more villages came to pay their respects at Fort Zeelandia and assure the VOC of their friendly intentions. However, the new masters of Mattau also inherited their enemies, with both Favorlang and Tirosen expressing hostility towards the VOC in the wake of their victory.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{in their}} usual home strip of red shirts and white shorts {{kicked off the}} match and {{immediately}} won a corner, which was dealt with by Westerveld. A run by Heskey six minutes later resulted in the player taking a tumble under Gilles Grimandi's challenge, but his appeals for a penalty were ignored by referee Dunn. Arsenal began to dominate play, with Vieira at the heart <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> moves. The midfielder won a challenge with Heskey in the 17th minute and sent {{the ball in the}} direction of Fredrik Ljungberg, who in turn passed it to Henry. The Frenchman went around Westerveld and shot the ball goalwards, which was cleared off the line by Stéphane Henchoz. Television replays later showed the ball hitting Henchoz's arm before going wide; although Henry appealed for a penalty, it was turned down as the incident was missed by both the referee and his assistant. Owen came close to scoring in the 20th minute, but for his shot to be blocked by Martin Keown. Arsenal continued to find the best openings, but struggled to split open the Liverpool defence. A long range effort by Grimandi was easily saved by Westerveld as the final approached the half-hour mark, and a duel between Wiltord and Jamie Carragher on the right side resulted in a Liverpool corner. Two minutes before the interval Henry was penalised for drifting into an offside position, having collected a long pass.|$|E

5|$|Copp {{wrote that}} Charnwood should have {{produced}} a rapid breakthrough but concedes that the battle {{was one of the}} most difficult of the campaign. Buckley singles out poor cooperation between armoured and infantry units as one of the reasons for such high Allied losses; he is critical of the habit of tanks standing off from German positions and firing the infantry onto the objective like artillery, instead of moving forward to give close support. He further notes that from the German perspective, the Anglo-Canadian forces apparently lacked the desire or ability to press home their advantages, citing Kurt Meyer's opinion that during the battle the Allies allowed the opportunity of destroying his 12th SS Panzer Division to elude them. Buckley comments on the defensive power of the British and Canadian formations. The German practice of conducting immediate local counter-attacks to retake lost ground cost them many <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> troops, losses they could ill-afford. He illustrates this with a typical action during which the Germans lost 13 tanks to British self-propelled anti-tank guns.|$|E
5|$|Darius {{crossed the}} Black Sea at the Bosphorus Straits using a bridge of boats. Darius conquered large {{portions}} of Eastern Europe, even crossing the Danube to wage war on the Scythians. Darius invaded European Scythia in 513 BC, where the Scythians evaded Darius's army, using feints and retreating eastwards while laying waste to the countryside, by blocking wells, intercepting convoys, destroying pastures and continuous skirmishes against Darius's army. Seeking to fight with the Scythians, Darius's army chased the Scythian army deep into Scythian lands, {{where there were no}} cities to conquer and no supplies to forage. In frustration Darius {{sent a letter to the}} Scythian ruler Idanthyrsus to fight or surrender. The ruler replied that he would not stand and fight with Darius until they found the graves of their fathers and tried to destroy them. Until then, they would continue their strategy as they had no cities or cultivated lands to lose. Despite the evading tactics of the Scythians, Darius' campaign was so far relatively successful. As presented by Herodotus, the tactics used by the Scythians resulted in the loss <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> lands and of damage to their loyal allies. This gave Darius the initiative. As he moved eastwards in the cultivated lands of the Scythians in Eastern Europe proper, he remained resupplied by his fleet and lived to an extent off the land. While moving eastwards in the European Scythian lands, he captured the large fortified city of the Budini, one of the allies of the Scythians, and burnt it.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> league finish since 1997–98, Benfica negotiated a one-year extension to Camacho's contract, {{which had been}} set to expire on 30 June. As a condition to agreeing to stay, he wanted several problems related to the technical staff, training fields and signings to be solved. On 23 June, Camacho agreed to remain as manager, with Pepe Carcelén and Álvaro Magalhães assisting him. In his presentation, he confessed that the club's limited finances would {{make it harder to}} sign players; he also said that Benfica would give their best but did not expect to dethrone Porto. Benfica inquired after Helton, and Ricardo to compete with José Moreira for the goalkeeper position. Over the course of two weeks, the club negotiated unsuccessfully with the latter and ultimately chose to stay with Moreira. The club also looked into strengthen their options at centre and at left-back, negotiating unsuccessfully with Ânderson Polga, Atouba and Júnior. Despite these failed negotiations, Benfica added Luisão, and re-signed Geovanni; both would be regular starters throughout the season.|$|E

5|$|In the {{off-season}} the Blue Jackets' approach to building their team changed, {{moving from a}} team of young developing players into one with established players. The first deal General Manager Scott Howson made was the acquisition of All-Star forward Jeff Carter on June 23, 2011. The deal sent Jakub Voracek, Columbus' first-round draft choice, the eighth overall, and their third-round pick in the 2011 Draft to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for Carter. The trade received a positive response in Columbus from fans and management who felt they finally had a number one center to play alongside <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> player, Rick Nash. Next, they traded for the negotiating rights of soon to be free agent James Wisniewski. Wisniewski scored a career high 51 points during the 2010–11 season, splitting time between the New York Islanders and Montreal Canadiens. The point total was fifth-highest in the league for defenseman scoring, tying Tobias Enstrom. The Blue Jackets came to terms with Wisniewski, just an hour {{prior to the start}} of free agency, signing him to a six-year, $33 million deal.|$|E
5|$|York {{produced}} some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> football {{in a decade}} in 1964–65, winning 20 league matches at home—a club record—and ending the season in third place to gain promotion, one point behind champions Brighton & Hove Albion. The following season, {{they were in the}} bottom four by late December 1965. They finished the season in bottom place and were relegated back to the Fourth Division, having conceded a club-record 106 goals. After the season ended, York released Norman Wilkinson, who had scored a club-record 143 goals. York struggled throughout 1966–67 and finished 22nd after a club-record eight successive defeats. The club was forced into its third re-election bid, which was successful with 45 votes. Kitchin resigned the chairmanship in June 1967 and was succeeded by Derrick Blundy, who held the position for 16 months, after which Eric Magson took over. York started 1967–68 winning none of their first 13 matches. Their first win came in late October 1967, by which time Lockie had become the first manager to be dismissed by the club. Former Sheffield United player Joe Shaw took charge in November 1967, and York rose from bottom place to 14th by late March 1968. However, they won none of their last eight matches and finished 21st. Another application for re-election was made, which was successful with 46 votes. Shaw resigned for personal reasons a week into 1968–69, and former Huddersfield Town manager Tom Johnston succeeded him in October 1968. Poor away form led to York finishing 21st, and the club's application for re-election was successful with 45 votes. The team reached the FA Cup third round, and were beaten 2–0 at home by First Division team Stoke City.|$|E
