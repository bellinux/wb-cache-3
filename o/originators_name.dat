Traditionally, the host image is embedded using <b>originator's</b> <b>name,</b> graphical logo and serial number which {{can easily be}} forged. Biometric watermarking, which synergistically integrates biometrics and the digital watermarking technology, is therefore proposed to replace the traditional digital watermarking techniques. The primary advantage of the offline handwritten {{is that it is}} a type of biometric behavioral attribute possessing unique means to identify an individually unambiguously...|$|R

5000|$|It {{was also}} there in Melbourne where Shirai {{successfully}} unveiled yet another, his third, original skill on vault (sixth combined skill overall) Shirai III, {{which is also}} now the third Yurchenko-style vault to bear his name. Technically, the skill is a round-off back-handspring with a full twist entry (Scherbo) on and a double twist off the vaulting platform, and has a difficulty score of 5.4 under the 2017-2020 Code of Points. Incidentally, a [...] "Scherbo 2.5 twist" [...] has already been evaluated to a difficulty score of 5.8 in the 2017-2020 Code of Points and can {{begin the process of}} officially taking its <b>originator's</b> <b>name</b> once it has been successfully completed during any one of the many selected international competitions in the future.|$|R

As the power of the Corcu Loígde alias Dáirine as Kings of Munster, Tara, and a large part of Ireland faded in the Dark Ages, their empire broken up, their center of political power shifted south into the wild country of West Cork, or Ross Carbery as it is known in local history, and this is where the O'Driscoll clan has been prominent throughout history.|$|R
40|$|Matthew Flinders stands {{second only}} to James Cook in our celebration of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s {{maritime}} exploration.

5000|$|Bango is a music style {{created and}} made popular at the East African Coast by Joseph Ngala. It fuses {{traditional}} Portuguese music genres, Arabic influenced taarab music, jazz and music genres of local coastal Bantu languages. It resembles easy listening music styles of Latin america such as bossa nova and music styles of many Indian Ocean Islands such as Seychelles and Mauritius. Joseph Ngala (also known by stage name [...] "Mzee Ngala") is a renowned Kenyan Bango musician {{who comes from}} Freretown, Mombasa, and also {{the founder of the}} genre. He performed in the past with famous groups such as the Hodi Boys and was also founder and band leader of the 60s and 70s group Bahari Boys. In the band, he was their main composer and inspiration. In fact, Mzee Ngala's song [...] "Bango" [...] is the <b>originator</b> of the <b>name</b> Bango. The resilience of the name, Bango, is testament to the genre created by Mzee Ngala.|$|R
500|$|The {{reaction}} of crowds in Australia was slightly different. According to Justin Parkinson, {{in his book}} {{on the history of}} English legspin, they took to [...] "calling Bosanquet 'Elsie', a tribute to the elaborate, supposedly effeminate jumpers he wore." [...] They also named the googly delivery a [...] "Bosie". However, this may have been more than a simple shortening of his name. According to Parkinson, it may have referred to the nickname ("Bosey") of Lord Alfred Douglas who was widely known to have had a homosexual affair, a criminal act at the time, with Oscar Wilde. This remained a topical subject, and the source of humour, in Australia. Parkinson suggests that the anonymous <b>originator</b> of the <b>name</b> [...] "Bosie" [...] for the googly must have been aware of the association. He also notes that the other common term in Australia for the googly was [...] "wrong 'un", which was slang for both [...] "criminal" [...] and [...] "homosexual". Parkinson suggests that these two terms for the googly, the nickname [...] "Elsie", were attempts to [...] "label the whole English ruling class as effete".|$|R
50|$|Just to {{the west}} of Courtice was a {{neighbouring}} hamlet called Prestonvale (today part of Courtice). It was once called Black's Hill and in 1825 was the site of the first post office in Darlington Township located just east of today's Stuttering Johns's Smokehouse. The postmaster was none other than Colonel James Black, the <b>originator</b> of the <b>name.</b> It was also later called Tooley's Hill after Augustus Tooley who ran the grist mill at Kingston Road where Farewell Creek crosses underneath Highway 2. Today this is the present location across the road from the Tim Horton's. The children of Prestonvale went to a school (Section #8) called Mount Carswell located {{on the north side of}} Concession 3 (now Nash Rd), just west of Trulls Rd on James Reynolds' farmstead. Alf Wilborn ran the blacksmith shop at the corner of Kingston Rd. and Prestonvale Rd. A sawmill existed on the north side of Nash Rd. just to the east of Farewell Creek, where you can see an old bridge just to the north of the present day bridge. This property was the farmstead of William Scott. Across the street from the school was the Temperance Hall located on A.V. Scott's property.|$|R
40|$|The {{bioengineered}} {{tissue plasminogen}} activator tenecteplase is an important treatment modality of acute myocardial infarction recommended by international guidelines. Following introduction of <b>originator</b> tenecteplase (brand <b>names</b> Metalyse® and TNKase®), a ‘biosimilar’ tenecteplase became available for commercial use in India under the brand name Elaxim® {{in the absence of}} Indian biosimilar guidelines which came into force from September 15 th, 2012. Based on a report of biochemical and fibrinolytical differences between Metalyse and Elaxim, we have systematically compared them in a range of routine quality testing assays. As compared to Metalyse, Elaxim exhibited less clot lysis activity and contained less of the two-chain form of tenecteplase. Even upon full in vitro conversion to the two-chain form Elaxim exhibited less clot lysis activity. This was linked to differences in sialic acid content and glycosylation pattern with Elaxim exhibiting less bi- and more tetra-antennary glycosylation, leading to different charge heterogeneity profile. Regarding purity, Elaxim contained more tenecteplase aggregates and, in contrast to Metalyse, considerable amounts of Chinese hamster ovary cell protein. Taken together these data demonstrate that Metalyse and Elaxim differ considerably in clot lysis activity and biochemical properties. These data question whether Elaxim indeed can be considered a ‘biosimilar’ of Metalyse, i. e. whether and to which extent the clinical efficacy and safety properties of Metalyse can be extrapolated to Elaxim in the absence of comparative clinical data...|$|R
40|$|Background & Problem discussion: The {{relative}} {{low interest}} {{rate in the}} first part of the new millennium spurred on demand for mortgage financing and by extension also fueled the housing market, primarily in the United States. Subprime loans were incorporated into and repackaged into various ABS. As the house prices declined and the subprime mortgages resetting at increasingly higher rates of interest, borrower defaults. Many equity and mezzanine tranches of MBSs and by extension CDOs were wiped out. The problem of not knowing which securitization investments were good and which were bad led to a halt in investment altogether. Aim and purpose: The main purpose of this study is to qualitatively explore the information exchange between originator and investor of a CDO security. A further purpose of this study is to complement the existing research in the mapping of a CDO transaction. Methodology: This paper examines the human factor in the originator-investor environment of a CDO transaction. Thus, a qualitative approach to the problem is used. Interviews with people at some of the largest financial institutions of the market, actively involved in the investment decision on both originator and investor side has been conducted. Results: The study shows that there exists a mismatch in the information supplied by the participating originators and what is actually demanded by the investors, for purposes of investing in CDOs. The informational demand from the investors reaches beyond the current disclosure requirements enforced by the SEC, and encompasses such intangible aspects that could never be fully conveyed through an investment prospectus such <b>originator</b> brand <b>name.</b> It appears that the perceived success or failure of a CDO relies to a great extent on the individuals involved, and not so much on the structure of the CDO or its underlying assets. In that sense, the human factor, intangible values and the issue of trust surfaces as more incorporated into the decision making processes. In that sense, the term “conveyed information” should encompass a broader definition than the just the investment prospectus. However, if this will be sufficient enough for an investor to make an informed investment decision warrants further studies from the standpoints of the findings of this paper...|$|R
40|$|Background: South Africa has {{followed}} a pro-generic policy since {{the introduction of}} the National Drug Policy in 1996. The selection processes in {{the public and private sectors}} have, however, remained largely disconnected, and at times contradictory. Medicines provided outside of hospitals accounted for 17 % of medical aid spend in 2006, up 8. 8 % from the previous year. Of particular concern to funders has been the expenditure on the 27 chronic conditions listed as Prescribed Minimum Benefits. The Medical Schemes Act (No 131 of 1998) provides for the definition of Prescribed Minimum Benefits, which stipulate a package of services or care a medical scheme must provide for in its benefit design. There is pressure to reconsider these requirements in order to increase the affordability of medical scheme coverage. This study assessed the potential savings that would be achievable by substituting generics for brand <b>name</b> (<b>originator)</b> medicines listed in the chronic disease algorithms set out by the Council for Medical Schemes (CMS). Methods: All medicines listed in the 25 chronic diseases algorithms made available by the CMS were identified. Brand and generic versions were identified in the Monthly Index of Medical Specialties (MIMS, May 2006). Single exit prices inclusive of value added tax were obtained from the web site of the Pharmaceutical Blue Book and the cost per defined daily dose for one month was then calculated. Cost differentials, where available, were then identified for each medicine listed in the algorithms. Cost differentials for medicines within each algorithm were presented as the median of the difference between brand and generic medicines listed for that algorithm, and also as the median of differences between generic medicines for the same condition...|$|R
40|$|The term “Hemicellulose” {{is applied}} to the cell-wall {{constituents}} extracted from plant tissues by cold 4 % sodium hydroxide, after preliminary extractions with cold water and 0. 5 % ammonium oxalate to remove pectic substances and water-soluble materials. The <b>originator</b> of the <b>name</b> was Schultze who, in 1891 and succeeding years, isolated there substances from a number of plant materials by extraction with dilute alkali and precipitation with acid. He observed that they were far more susceptible to dilute acid hydrolysis than cellulose, and believed them to be in some way related to cellulose, probably as intermediates in its formation. Although the eludication of the structure of cellulose and the analysis of hemicellulose have shown that there is little foundation for this belief, the name “hemicellulose” still persists. Hemicelluloses are polysaccharides which generally contain uronic acid. One of the few well-authenticated true hexosans that may be removed by alkali from the cell-wall of a higher plant is the mannan of the ivory nut. When dried by alcohol, hemicellulose preparations are obtained as fine, white or cream, amorphous powders; whereas, if dried from water, they form an extremely hard, horny mass, which will redissolve only with difficulty even if finely ground. The hemicelluloses are optically active, and usually more or less strongly laevo-rotatory. The majority of hemicellulose preparations give either no colour or a slightly greenish colour with iodine. The hemicellulose “A” of black-locust and of English oak sap-woods, precipitated by hydrochloric acid, was found to give a strong blue colouration with iodine. Anderson (1940) found that those hemicelluloses which are coloured by iodine solution usually give some d-glucose along with d-xylose in the products of hydrolysis. O’Dwyer suggests that in these hemicelluloses, anhydro-glucose units form a part of the molecule. It is more probable however, that they are derived from starch associated with it...|$|R
