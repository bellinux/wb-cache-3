25|$|The {{court is}} one of many bodies created by the {{constitution}} to defend the rights of citizens. It is concerned basically with matters of broad constitutional principle.

25|$|In lobbying, the {{revolving}} door is the cycling of former federal employees into jobs as lobbyists while former K Street employees are pulled into government positions. Government <b>officials</b> <b>can</b> only work certain terms in their positions, for example senators, and afterwards they form valuable connections that could help influence future law making. The other form of {{the revolving}} door is pushing lobbyists into government positions, and then developing connections and returning into the lobbying world to use said connections. This is a controversial issue in the political lobbying world.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} a number of criticisms of the premium support model. Some have raised concern about risk selection, where {{insurers}} find ways to avoid covering people expected to have high health care costs. Premium support proposals, such as the 2011 plan proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan (R–Wis.), have aimed to avoid risk selection by including protection language mandating that plans participating in such coverage must provide insurance to all beneficiaries and are not able to avoid covering higher risk beneficiaries. Some critics are concerned that the Medicare population, which has particularly high rates of cognitive impairment and dementia, would have a hard time choosing between competing health plans. Robert Moffit, a senior fellow of The Heritage Foundation responded to this concern, stating that while there may be research indicating that individuals have difficulty making the correct choice of health care plan, there is no evidence to show that government <b>officials</b> <b>can</b> make better choices. Henry Aaron, one of the original proponents of premium supports, has recently argued that the idea should not be implemented, given that Medicare Advantage plans have not successfully contained costs more effectively than traditional Medicare and because the political climate is hostile to the kinds of regulations that would be needed to make the idea workable.|$|E

2500|$|Former mayor Lee P. Brown {{denounced the}} term limits, saying they {{prevented}} incumbents from gaining enough experience in city government. A proposal {{to double the}} current two-year term of office has been debatedas of 2005, several candidates for the city council have brought {{up the issue of}} whether term limits should be amended or eliminated. Some elected officials from the Greater Houston area within the Texas Legislatureprimarily Garnet Coleman and Sylvester Turnerhave also spoken out against term limits. [...] In 2010, a term limits review commission appointed by former Mayor Bill White called for amending the city charter on extending term limits where elected officials could serve two four-year terms; the proposal failed 8.18.10 after the Houston City Council voted 7-7. The November 3, 2015 City of Houston municipal elections a referendum on the voter ballot have amended the term limit law where elected <b>officials</b> <b>can</b> serve two four year terms - this measure does not abolish term limits nor have a reeligibility provision for past elected officeholders who served their full tenure under the 1991 term limit ordinance. Incumbents who have won re-election during the 2015 election under the three-term rule - those who served 2 are granted an additional 4 years while a freshman councilmember are granted their 2 additional terms - this means that some elected <b>officials</b> <b>can</b> hold up to 10 years in office (if a freshman councilmember who served during their 2014-16 term) or 8 years in office (for those elected in 2011 and re-elected to their final term).|$|E
