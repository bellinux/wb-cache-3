500|$|Louis XIV {{gave the}} exiled King and Queen {{the use of}} Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, where they set up court-in-exile. Mary soon became a popular fixture at Louis XIV's court at Versailles, where diarist Madame de Sévigné {{acclaimed}} Mary for her [...] "distinguished bearing and her quick wit". Questions of precedence, however, marred Mary's relations with the Dauphine of France, Maria Anna of Bavaria. Because Mary was accorded the privileges and rank of a queen, Maria Anna was outranked by her. Therefore, Maria Anna refused to see Mary, etiquette being a sensitive issue at Versailles. In spite of this, Louis XIV and his secret wife, Madame de Maintenon, became close friends with Mary. As there was no queen at the French court, nor a dauphine after 1690, Mary took precedence over all the female members of the French court and French royal house, as did her daughter in her capacity of a royal princess until the next French dauphine appeared in 1711. James was largely excluded from French court life. His contemporaries found him boring, and French courtiers frequently joked that [...] "when <b>one</b> <b>talks</b> to him, one understands why he is here." [...] Mary gave birth to Princess Louise Mary in 1692. She was to be James and Mary's last child.|$|E

2500|$|Gonggu (Jyutping: Gong2 gu2; Traditional Chinese: 講古, {{literally}} [...] "to {{talk about}} the past") is a popular folk art in Lingnan. It involves artists telling stories from Chinese classics or Cantonese folklore using the Cantonese language - while borrowing techniques from Cantonese opera {{in order to be}} very rhythmic at that. This art form originated in 16th century, when Cantonese imported it from Jiangsu and several Cantonese artists learnt from the then famous Wuyue storytellers. Since that time, Cantonese Gonggu has seen steady development, with storytellers performing in their own stalls or Cantonese teahouses. Starting from 20th century, the area around Gwongzau has even started erecting [...] "storytelling stages" [...] (Jyutping: Syut3 syu1 toi4; Traditional Chinese: 說書台, literally [...] "stages where <b>one</b> <b>talks</b> about books") in certain parks and inviting artists to do Gonggu on radio shows.|$|E
2500|$|Jemison {{resigned}} from NASA in March 1993. [...] "I left NASA because I'm {{very interested in}} how social sciences interact with technologies," [...] Jemison said. [...] "People always think of technology as something having silicon in it. But a pencil is technology. Any language is technology. Technology is a tool we use to accomplish a particular task and when <b>one</b> <b>talks</b> about appropriate technology in developing countries, appropriate may mean anything from fire to solar electricity." [...] NASA training manager and author Homer Hickam later expressed some regret that she had departed, saying, [...] "NASA had {{spent a lot of}} money training her; she also filled a niche, obviously, being a woman of color." [...] Hickam had trained Jemison for her flight on Spacelab-J/STS-47. In an interview with the Des Moines Register on October 16, 2008, Jemison said that she was not driven to be the [...] "first black woman to go into space."

[...] Sadly, the people most affected by the spills get rewarded not even a penny for their agony". Amata stated in an interview {{that the purpose of the}} film is to [...] "bring to light the injustice and inhumane situation of the Niger Delta", he also said [...] "If BP can be made to compensate the people of the Gulf of Mexico, why can't the world make the oil companies polluting our land make amends? We have been suffering spills the size of Exxon Valdez for 50 years, yet no <b>one</b> <b>talks</b> about it, as long as they benefit from the oil." [...] The producer of the film Dede Mabiaku says Black November is [...] "an eye-opening movie with a cause" [...] which he says should be able to encourage people to fight for the immediate clean-up of the Niger Delta. The Guardian states; [...] "Amata's film is weighing into the 50-year history of western exploitation of the delta's oil resources, local collusion and violent resistance to it".|$|E
