5000|$|Endorheic lakes {{are usually}} in the {{interior}} of a landmass, far from an ocean in areas of relatively low rainfall. Their watersheds are often confined by natural geologic land formations such as a mountain range, cutting off water egress to the ocean.

40|$|ABSTRACT] The {{hydrological}} {{characteristics of}} the lake Bosten are studied based on the analysis of available data obtained from 1976 to 1989 at the hydrological stations around the lake. The results are as follows: (1) The annual average of volume transport of main inflow river, named Kaidu river, varies from 80 to 120 m^ 3 /s. The maximum and minimum values are found in 1980 and 1986, respectively. (2) The <b>other</b> <b>inflow</b> rivers and the outflow river show almost steady volume transports during this period. (3) The water level of the lake Bosten decreases and has the minimum value at 1987, then increases slightly. (4) The seasonal water balance of the lake is investigated from March 1983 to February 1984 in detail. The result shows that only evaporation, precipitation, discharges of the main rivers, and the change of water level can not explain the water balance...|$|R
40|$|For {{the last}} two decades, foreign capital was {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most important factors in Thailand because of an attempt to raise the level of economic growth.

40|$|In this paper, {{the case}} of expansionary {{monetary}} policy and capital inflow is investigated {{in the context of}} the Nigerian economy. The investigation reveals that increase in money supply contributed to the decline in total capital inflow to the economy, and in particular, the contribution was quite significant for foreign direct investment, as well as <b>other</b> financial <b>inflows</b> (excluding portfolio investment). The contribution in respect of <b>other</b> financial <b>inflows</b> superseded that of foreign direct investment. These findings, derived from a rigorous analysis based on vector auto-regression model, demonstrate that expansionary monetary policy was pursued over the years to the detriment of capital inflow and its potentials for economic growth, suggesting that efforts need to be intensified to attract more foreign capital, instead of undue emphasis on monetary expansion. This could be a better option to facilitate rapid economic growth of the country, and indeed all developing countries. Monetary Policy, Capital Inflow, Emerging Economy...|$|R
50|$|Boshkung is {{diamond-shaped}} {{with the}} two axes running roughly north-south and east-west. The longer north-south axis is about 5.7 km long and the east-west 3.1 km. The lake has a maximum known depth of 71 metres (233 feet). It {{is one of several}} lakes that make up the Gull River Watershed. One of three primary inflows is the Gull River from Beech Lake {{on the east side of}} the lake. <b>Other</b> <b>inflows</b> are the Kennisis River over the Buttermilk Falls from Halls Lake at the north, and the Boshkung River over the Buck Slides Dam from Kushog Lake at the west. The primary outflow is the continuation of the Gull River and its extensive watershed system downstream through a narrows to Little Boshkung Lake at the south, whose waters eventually flow into Balsam Lake and via the Trent-Severn Waterway to Lake Ontario. There is one named bay, Echo Bay, on the east side (formerly 'Loon Echo Bay'), south of the inflow of the Beech River. It also has a handful of small islands, two of which have seasonally occupied structures, at Echo Island in Echo Bay, and on one of the Gull Islands close to the lake's south end. Two Tree Island sits near the west shore. Boshkung experienced a reported 117 year high water event in the spring of 2013 pursuant to the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources historical data. This flooding, including damages, impacted a wide range of lakes and communities in the Gull River and other watershed regions.|$|E

The amount of water needed to sustain Lake Cahuilla {{at a level of}} 12 m above sea level is possibly about half of the discharge of the Colorado River.Sedimentation of the Colorado River Delta directed water into the Lake Cahuilla area. Distributaries in a river delta are inherently unstable and tend to change course often. Major floods may have triggered the change in river course, although most of the flood events in the prehistoric record {{do not appear to be}} associated with diversions to Lake Cahuilla. Given that the slope toward Lake Cahuilla is steeper than the one toward the Gulf of California, once the river entered the basin it likely stabilized on that course. In fact, it is remarkable that this slope difference doesn't regularly cause the river to enter the Salton Trough. The diversion occurred close to the apex of the Colorado River Delta and would have discharged water directly through the Alamo River and indirectly through Volcano Lake and the New River. The infilling of the lake may have been a catastrophic flood, considering that native people fled the Imperial Valley to the mountains. Infilling to an altitude of 12 m above sea level would have taken 20-12 years. When the lake was full, the Colorado River would have entered it at the southeastern side.|$|E

40|$|Cameroon {{is a small}} {{open economy}} that relies on the export of a few primary {{products}} for its foreign exchange earnings. The low rate of savings cannot meet the investment requirements, and investment has been declining despite many years of economic reform. There is consequently a resource gap {{that has to be}} filled by both official and private resource inflows, but these resource inflows have similarly been declining. They have also become highly volatile, thus undermining their positive effects on capital formation and consequently on economic growth and poverty reduction. This study examined the effect of resource inflows and their volatility on domestic investment in Cameroon. The results show that inflow volatility is high and that export revenue volatility is the prime mover of aggregate volatility. There is no evidence of inflow volatilities reinforcing or offsetting each other. Aggregate resource flow is important for both public and private domestic investment, while its volatility is detrimental. When total resource flows is disaggregated into export revenue, official flows, foreign direct investment and “other private flows”, only export revenue and “other private flows” significantly affect private investment, indicating that the impact on investment varies {{depending on the type of}} inflow. The volatility of official flows and export revenue hurts investment directly, but also negates the influence of the <b>other</b> <b>inflows</b> on both private and public investment. The study suggests that government make more efforts to attract more resource flows into the country and, especially, to reduce their volatility. Diversifying export supplies to minimize price fluctuations, complying with aid conditionalities (this should be facilitated with the country ownership of the poverty reduction strategy), developing a robust and transparent financial sector and stock exchange, and avoiding frequent and unpredictable policy shifts are among the actions that can go a long way to reduce resource flow volatility. Domestic investment, and consequently growth and poverty reduction, should be the main beneficiaries. ...|$|E
