5|$|According to legend, the Roman King Servius Tullius {{enacted a}} series of {{constitutional}} reforms in the 6th century BC. One of these reforms resulted {{in the creation of}} a new <b>organizational</b> <b>unit</b> with which to divide citizens. This unit, the Tribe, was based on geography rather than family, and was created to assist in future reorganizations of the army. In 471 BC, a law was passed which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they had organized on the basis of the Curia. The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary Tribal Assembly (which also organized on the basis of the Tribes) was that the Tribes of the Plebeian Council only included Plebeians, whereas the Tribes of the Tribal Assembly included both Plebeians and Patricians.|$|E

40|$|When an {{enterprise}} {{is divided into}} smaller <b>organizational</b> <b>units,</b> {{each with its own}} results accountability, the question arises how to manage and measure the efficiency and profitability of such units. A task which is complicated when <b>organizational</b> <b>units</b> in the same enterprise or enterprise group trade internally as the units have to decide what prices should be paid for such inter-unit transfers. One important challenge is to uncover the consequences that different transfer prices have on the willingness in the <b>organizational</b> <b>units</b> to coordinate activities and trade internally. At the same time the determination of transfer price will affect the size of the profit or loss in the <b>organizational</b> <b>units</b> and thus {{have an impact on the}} evaluation of managers‟ performance. In some instances the determination of transfer prices may lead to a disagreement between coordination of the <b>organizational</b> <b>units</b> and overall profitability of the enterprise on the one hand and measurement of profitability and managers‟ performance in the units on the other.

The corporate nature of power structures is of particular interest to centralized procurement management, as it provides significant advantages through coordination, eliminating duplication, and economy of scale. This article presents optimization models of the supply of state power structures’ <b>organizational</b> <b>units</b> with centralized procurement, for different levels of simulated materiel and technical support processes. The models allow us to find the most profitable options for state power structures’ <b>organizational</b> supply <b>units</b> in a centre-oriented logistics system in conditions of the changing needs, volume of allocated funds, and logistics costs that accompany the process of supply, by maximizing the provision level of <b>organizational</b> <b>units</b> with necessary material and technical resources for the entire planning period of supply by minimizing the total logistical costs, taking into account the diverse nature and the different priorities of <b>organizational</b> <b>units</b> and material and technical resources...|$|R

In this study we explore how multiunit firms might develop ambidextrous <b>organizational</b> <b>units</b> in response to environmental demands.

Our study reveals that multiunit firms develop ambidextrous <b>organizational</b> <b>units</b> to compete in dynamically competitive environments. Moreover, we show that <b>organizational</b> <b>units</b> with decentralized and densely connected social relations are able to act ambidextrously and pursue exploratory and exploitative innovations simultaneously. Our study provides new insights how multiunit firms can cope with contradictorily pressures for exploratory and exploitative innovations...|$|R
