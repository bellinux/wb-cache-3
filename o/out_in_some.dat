5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Heaven's Gate mass suicide, La Luz del Mundo found itself embroiled in a {{controversy}} that would play <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> of Mexico's major media outlets. Former members and anti-cult groups leveraged accusations against the church and its leadership. Church members and sympathizers defended the integrity of the church. Academics, meanwhile, denounced a climate of intolerance toward religious minorities in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 and 2007, a {{team from}} the University of West Bohemia, {{together}} with Salahaddin University in Arbil, carried out an extensive survey and evaluation of the entire citadel. As part of this project, geodetic measurements of the citadel were taken and these were combined with satellite imagery, regular photographic imagery and aerial photographs to create a map and digital 3D model of the citadel mound and the houses on top of it. Geophysical prospection was carried <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> areas of the citadel to detect traces of older architecture buried under the present houses. Archaeological investigations included an archaeological survey on the western slope of the citadel mound, and the excavation of a small test trench {{in the eastern part}} of the citadel.|$|E

25|$|Adult {{illiteracy}} {{was reduced}} but not wiped <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> <b>some</b> countries, {{the number of}} people attending universities doubled or even tripled. Access to secondary education also showed increases. One out of every four school-age children were provided with an extra food ration. Many people were provided with new schools, textbooks, or housing.|$|E
25|$|Parts of the United Kingdom {{have had}} drought {{problems}} in recent years, particularly in 2004-2006. Fires broke <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> areas, even across the normally damp higher ground of north-west England and Wales. The landscape {{in much of}} England and east Wales became very parched, even near the coast; water restrictions were in place in some areas.|$|E

25|$|Two-slit {{diffraction}} is {{a famous}} {{example of the}} strange behaviors that waves regularly display, that are not intuitively associated with particles. The overlapping waves from the two slits cancel each other <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> locations, and reinforce each other in other locations, causing a complex pattern to emerge. Intuitively, one would not expect this pattern from firing a single particle at the slits, because the particle should pass through one slit or the other, not a complex overlap of both.|$|E
25|$|Slige Midluachra – {{this road}} ran {{southeast}} from Ulster, and passed through Tara, {{the seat of}} the High Kings of Ireland in County Meath. It crossed the Liffey at the ford of hurdles, and came to an end just south of Áth Cliath. Parts of the Slige Midluachra may still be made <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> of Dublin's modern streets: e.g. Bow Street {{on the north side of}} the city, and St Augustine Street and Francis Street on the south side.|$|E
25|$|In the North of England particularly, {{there was}} fierce resistance; {{the local people}} {{considered}} that the existing system there was running smoothly. They argued {{that the nature of}} cyclical unemployment meant that any new workhouse built would be empty for most of the year and thus a waste of money. However, the unlikely union between property owners and paupers did not last, and opposition, though fierce, eventually petered <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> <b>some</b> cases, this was further accelerated as the protests very successfully undermined parts of the Amendment Act and became obsolete.|$|E

25|$|Syrian rebels overran {{two police}} {{stations}} in Aleppo city, {{killing at least}} 40 policemen.

Continued rebel resistance against armour and artillery in districts of Salheddine and Hamdaniyeh.

25|$|Because the {{previously}} popular fumigant methyl bromide has been phased <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> countries under the Montreal Protocol, phosphine {{is the only}} widely used, cost-effective, rapidly acting fumigant that does not leave residues on the stored product. Pests {{with high levels of}} resistance toward phosphine have become common in Asia, Australia and Brazil. High level resistance is also likely to occur in other regions, but has not been as closely monitored. Genetic variants that contribute to high level resistance to phosphine have been identified in the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase gene. Identification of this gene now allows rapid molecular identification of resistant insects.|$|E
25|$|The Americans were {{supportive}} of Kỳ and his {{prosecution of the}} war against the communists, and they opposed Thi, regarding him as not being firm enough against communism. Thi did, however, have the support of Marine Lieutenant General Lewis Walt, who commanded American forces in I Corps and was the senior adviser to Thi's ARVN forces. This caused problems during the dispute. The dismissal caused widespread demonstrations in the northern provinces. Civil unrest grew, as civil servants, disaffected military personnel, and the working under-class joined the anti-government demonstrations led by the Buddhists. At first, Kỳ tried to ignore the demonstrations and wait for them to peter out, but the problem escalated and riots broke <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> places.|$|E

25|$|Pica is most {{commonly}} seen in pregnant women, small children, {{and those with}} developmental disabilities such as autism. Children eating painted plaster containing lead may suffer brain damage from lead poisoning. There is a similar risk from eating soil near roads that existed before tetraethyllead in petrol was phased <b>out</b> (<b>in</b> <b>some</b> countries) or before people stopped using contaminated oil (containing toxic PCBs or dioxin) to settle dust. In addition to poisoning, {{there is also a}} much greater risk of gastro-intestinal obstruction or tearing in the stomach. Another risk of eating soil is the ingestion of animal feces and accompanying parasites. Pica can also be found in other animals and is commonly found in dogs.|$|E
25|$|An older {{method of}} {{harvesting}} {{is to use}} a sweep net, which operates a bit like a purse seine net. The sweep net is a big net with weights along the bottom edge. It is stretched across the pen with the bottom edge extending {{to the bottom of the}} pen. Lines attached to the bottom corners are raised, herding some fish into the purse, where they are netted. Before killing, the fish are usually rendered unconscious in water saturated in carbon dioxide, although this practice is being phased <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> countries due to ethical and product quality concerns. More advanced systems use a percussive-stun harvest system that kills the fish instantly and humanely with a blow to the head from a pneumatic piston. They are then bled by cutting the gill arches and immediately immersing them in iced water. Harvesting and killing methods are designed to minimise scale loss, and avoid the fish releasing stress hormones, which negatively affect flesh quality.|$|E
25|$|Prescott had {{a stormy}} {{relationship}} with the privatisation of the railway industry. He had vigorously opposed the privatisation of the industry while the Labour Party was in opposition, and disliked the party's policy, established in 1996 just before the flotation of Railtrack on the London Stock Exchange, of committing to renationalise the industry only when resources allowed, which he saw as meaning {{that it would never}} be done. Reluctantly, he supported the alternative policy, produced by then shadow transport secretary Clare Short, that the industry should be subjected to closer regulation by the to-be-created Strategic Rail Authority (in the case of the passenger train operators) and the Rail Regulator (in the case of the monopoly and dominant elements in the industry, principally Railtrack). The policy was spelled <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> detail in the Labour Party's statement in the June 1996 prospectus for the sale of Railtrack shares, and was widely regarded as having depressed the price of the shares.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "tulou" [...] {{also came}} <b>out</b> {{occasionally}} <b>in</b> <b>some</b> poems; other than that, {{the existence of}} tulou bypassed mainstream literature, and was not mentioned in literature published before 1956 dedicated {{to the study of}} the people's habitat.|$|R
25|$|Another {{supercell}} storm struck Tyneside {{without warning}} {{at the height}} of the evening rush hour causing widespread damage and travel chaos, locally known as the Toon Monsoon. Flooded shopping malls were evacuated, Newcastle station was closed, as was the Tyne & Wear Metro, and main road routes were flooded leading to massive tailbacks. Drivers were forced to abandon their cars, with many commuters stranded due to public transport closures. Northern Powergrid reported that 23,000 properties were left without electricity in North-East England after flash flooding and lightning storms hit the area. The Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service reported more than 1,500 calls relating to flooding on the night of 28 June. 999 land line services were knocked <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> areas and the damage ran to huge amounts only visible the next day after water cleared. Many parts of County Durham and Northumberland were also affected with thousands of homes across the North East left without power due to lightning strikes. Lightning was filmed striking the Tyne Bridge as motorists were sat gridlocked on it.|$|E
25|$|After {{his arrival}} in 1674, Captain Damian de Esplana ordered the arrest of rebels who {{attacked}} the population of certain towns. Hostilities {{eventually led to the}} destruction of villages such as Chochogo, Pepura, Tumon, Sidia-Aty, Sagua, Nagan and Ninca. Starting in June 1676, the first Spanish Governor of Guam, Capt. Francisco de Irrisarri y Vinar, controlled internal affairs more strictly than his predecessors in order to curb tensions. He also ordered the construction of schools, roads and other infrastructure. Later, Capt. Jose de Quiroga arrived in 1680 and continued some of the development projects started by his predecessors. He also continued the search for the rebels who had assassinated Father San Vitores, resulting in campaigns against the rebels which were hiding <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> islands, eventually leading to the death of Matapang, Hurao and Aguarin. Quiroga brought some natives from the northern islands to Guam, ordering the population to live in a few large villages. These included Jinapsan, Umatac, Pago, Agat and Inarajan, where he built a number of churches. By July 1695, Quiroga had completed the conquest of Guam, Rota, Tinian and Aguigan.|$|E
500|$|In {{some states}} joint {{physical}} custody creates a presumption of equal shared parenting, however in most states, {{joint physical custody}} creates an obligation to provide each of the parents with [...] "significant periods" [...] of physical custody so as to assure the child of [...] "frequent and continuing contact" [...] with both parents. For example, states such as Alabama, California, and Texas do not necessarily require joint custody orders to result in substantially equal parenting time, whereas states such as Arizona, Georgia, and Louisiana do require joint custody orders to result in substantially equal parenting time where feasible. Courts generally have not clearly defined what [...] "significant periods" [...] and [...] "frequent and continuous contact" [...] mean, which requires parents to litigate to find <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> <b>some</b> states, however, courts have provided a clear definition, for instance, in Nevada, the Supreme Court has defined joint physical custody as an arrangement where each parent has at least 40% of the custodial time on a yearly basis.|$|E
