40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{environmental}} competition. The underlying {{question is whether}} or not countries, or, more specifically, regulators and markets, compete among each other by the means of trading-off environmental assets such as clean air for economic performance. On the balance of the empirical results, the preliminary answer is yes - with some qualifications attached. After a comprehensive review of the literature on approaches towards the analysis of environmental performance across various social sciences, this thesis sets out to construct a proxy indicator for environmental performance, based on the relative performance across EU countries concerning several air pollutants. Using that indicator, this thesis classifies 15 EU member states according to their empirically observed pollution performance during the period 1990 to 1999. The classification produced four distinct clusters: poor and strong pollution performers, as well as two transition clusters. The second part of the thesis evolves around the idea to relate air pollution performance to a number of chemical industry performance variables using panel data. The main hypothesis to be tested is whether strong pollution performance has an impact on chemical industry performance, and if so, what the sign of that relationship would be. The three performance variables are production value, employment, and value of <b>intra-EU</b> <b>exports.</b> The results of the regression analysis show that strong pollution performance has a negative and significant impact on two of the three chemical industry performance variables, namely, on production value and <b>intra-EU</b> <b>exports.</b> On the other hand, this study does not produce evidence that strong pollution performance has an impact on the employment of the chemical industries in the EU...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{evaluate}} {{the influence of the}} European Internal Market Programme on the relative significance of the determinants of entry (via acquisitions and start-ups) by non-EU multinationals in some 102 UK manufacturing sectors. The occurrence of FDI is modelled as a two-step process in which factors affecting whether a sector gets any entry by foreign plants are first considered, and the determinant of the count of entries for those sectors that attract positive flow of FDI are then investigated. The empirical estimates point {{to the conclusion that the}} parameters of the FDI functions have changed in response to the challenges and opportunities created by increasing economic integration, but with some interesting contrasts between the two types of entries. Acquisition FDI appears to have become more responsive to the size of the European market and unit labour costs relative to the rest of the EU, and less sensitive to the local market size. It is also increasingly being concentrated in sectors with higher <b>intra-EU</b> <b>exports</b> propensity, consistent with the predominance of vertical FDI. By contrast, the significance of the size of UK market has not diminished in the greenfield investment model, and the importance of agglomeration economies has more than doubled during the process of integration. Since the FDI consequences of European integration vary according to the mode of foreign entry, the policy implications of our findings also depend on the type of FDI under consideration...|$|R

40|$|Austria's {{accession}} to the European Community {{has created a}} new framework against which to evaluate Austria's foreign trade sector. The EU 15 is the world's largest exporter. In 1994, exports of the EU, including trade within the EU, accounted for two fifths of world trade, twice as much as the trade share of the USA (11. 8 percent) and of Japan (9. 7 percent) taken together. Even excluding <b>intra-EU</b> trade, <b>which</b> in 1994 amounted to one fourth of world trade, the EU is the world's largest exporter with a share of 20 percent. In the 1990 s though, the EU suffered market losses. Foreign trade of the EU is heavily concentrated: the three largest countries (Germany, France, United Kingdom) account {{for more than half of}} total exports; the largest six countries account for more than four fifths (81 percent) of EU exports. About one fourth of EU exports originate in Germany alone. The EU countries conduct the major part of their foreign trade with each other. <b>Intra-EU</b> <b>exports</b> total 63 percent of total exports of the EU; intra-EU imports total 61 percent of total imports of the EU. With a share of 65 percent, Austria's integration into the EU is slightly above average. Even though Austria is one of the smaller EU countries, countries which as a rule are intensively engaged in trade, the relation of exports to GDP was only 22. 7 percent, slightly above the EU average (22. 3 percent). The EU's exports to countries outside the EU (extra-EU exports) amounted to 8. 4 percent of GDP. This figure was lower than that for Japan (8. 6 percent) and slightly higher than that for the USA Thus, foreign trade plays approximately the same role in all the regions of the triad. 75 percent of Austria's intra-EU imports originate in those seven EU countries which are considered likely candidates for the EMU. In both France and Germany, this figure is only 55 percent. These two countries, therefore, have the utmost interest in maintaining strict exchange rate discipline in the envisaged "EMS II". Austria is mainly concerned with Italy's participation in the EMU, because in that case the share of EU trade not jeopardized by exchange rate fluctuations would rise above 90 percent. The importance of the developing countries as a market for EU exports rose substantially during the early 1990 s. Sales to the non-OPEC countries advanced very rapidly, while OPEC's share in exports declined. 17. 7 percent of total extra-EU exports or almost half of the exports to the developing countries go to the Far East; the corresponding figures are 7. 5 percent for the Middle East, 8. 1 percent for Africa, and 5. 7 percent for Latin America. In Austria, 22 percent of extra-EU exports were destined for the developing countries; Austria also had a relatively strong position in the OPEC (6 percent). Manufactured products dominate foreign trade of the EU: this group accounts for 84. 1 percent of total exports, and 78. 8 percent of total imports, with machinery and transport equipment constituting the most important items. The share of semi-manufactures (mostly low-grade goods used in manufacturing) in exports is substantially smaller in the EU (18. 2 percent) than in Austria (28. 9 percent); steel accounted for only 3. 5 percent of total EU exports (Austria 5. 3 percent); the figures for textiles are 3. 1 percent (4. 1 percent). As far as intermediary products are concerned, agricultural products with a share of 10 percent are the most important export items. Außenhandel der EU.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of 1995 Austria's foreign trade {{can be divided into}} two separate areas: trade with the 14 other EU member states and trade with all other countries in the world. In 1994, intra-EU trade accounted for 65 percent of Austria's exports and 68 percent of imports. These shares exceed those of other EU member states. Thus, Austria's economy was closely linked to that of the EU through foreign trade even before accession to this group of countries. Intra-EU trade is favored vis-a-vis trade with third countries in a variety of ways: the abolishment of border controls, the elimination of variable import levies and tariffs on agricultural products and food, liberalization of public procurement, the abolishment of rules of origin and the simplification of technical provisions. Moreover, there is a tendency within the EU to impose anti-dumping tariffs on goods imported from successful competitors abroad. Suppliers from third countries are disadvantaged vis-a-vis sellers from within the EU at various levels. This {{was one of the reasons}} for Austria's decision to join the EU. In the recent past, Austria's trade with countries outside of the EU (extra-EU trade) has developed somewhat more dynamically than trade with EU countries (intra-EU trade) : in 1993 extra-EU exports rose by 3. 6 percent, while <b>intra-EU</b> <b>exports</b> declined by 7. 8 percent; in 1994 the figures were 11. 8 and 8. 4 percent. The difference can be attributed mainly to cyclical factors. After accession to the EU, Austria's intra-EU trade ought to grow faster than extra-EU trade thanks to more favorable conditions within the EU. This is likely to be the case in agricultural trade. As far as trade with manufacturing products is concerned, the impact of the improvement in trade relations might only be felt after some delay. Extra-EU trade (35 percent of total exports, 32 percent of total imports) might for analytical purposes be broken down into two parts: trade with countries "associated" with the EU (the remainder of the EFTA countries, the six countries of East-Central Europe with Europe agreements, as well the ACP countries), and trade with third countries. The countries of East-Central Europe associated with the EU accounted for 26 percent of Austria's extra-EU exports and 18 percent of extra-EU imports. The EFTA countries contributed 20 percent and 14 percent, respectively, to Austria's extra-EU trade. From Austria's perspective, the grouping of the overseas departments (DOM/TOM, e. g., the Canary Islands, Madeira), as well as the ACP countries (Africa, the Caribbean region, the Pacific region) is new. The latter group consists mainly of the former colonies of the founding members of the European Common Market. These countries enjoy special access to the markets of EU countries. At present, foreign trade with these countries is negligible, but might gain in importance in the future. Among the not associated third countries are the developing countries overseas (with a share of 22 percent in extra-EU trade) and the not associated countries of Eastern Europe (8 percent). Industrialized countries overseas account for 19 percent of extra-EU exports and 33 percent of extra-EU imports. Austria's accession to the EU means that the compilation of statistics on trade with EU countries can no longer be based on data as recorded at the border but must be compiled at the firm level based on value added tax returns (Intrastat). Statistics on trade with third countries (Extrastat) will be gathered as before at the border. The changeover to the new system is creating substantial difficulties. For some time no data on foreign trade will be available; this comes at an inopportune time when the current account is turning negative. At the moment it is still unclear how the system of national accounts might be used to substitute for the foreign trade statistics.
