5|$|Following the {{victories}} of Barack <b>Obama</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, {{relations between}} Bolivia and the U.S. improved slightly, and in November 2009 the countries entered negotiations to restore diplomatic relations. After the U.S. backed the 2011 {{military intervention in}} Libya by NATO forces, Morales condemned Obama, calling for his Nobel Peace Prize to be revoked. The two nations restored diplomatic relations in November 2011, although Morales refused to allow the DEA back into the country.|$|E
5|$|Joe Biden hung drywall at a Habitat for Humanity home in N.E.Washington,D.C. Biden's wife, Jill, their daughter, Ashley Biden, Michelle <b>Obama</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Obamas' daughters, Malia and Sasha, {{spent the}} morning at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium where they helped {{thousands}} of volunteers prepare more than 85,000 care packages destined for U.S.troops overseas. Later that evening, the President-elect hosted three separate bipartisan dinners to honor the service of JohnMcCain, ColinPowell and JoeBiden.|$|E
5|$|Following his defeat, McCain {{returned}} to the Senate amid varying views about what role he might play there. In mid-November 2008 he met with President-elect <b>Obama,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two discussed issues they had commonality on. Around the same time, McCain indicated {{that he intended to}} run for re-election to his Senate seat in 2010. As the inauguration neared, Obama consulted with McCain on a variety of matters, to an extent rarely seen between a president-elect and his defeated rival, and President Obama's inauguration speech contained an allusion to McCain's theme of finding a purpose greater than oneself.|$|E

5|$|On April 20, 2010, an {{explosion}} destroyed an {{offshore drilling rig}} at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review. As multiple efforts by BP failed, some {{in the media and}} public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by <b>Obama</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> federal government.|$|E
5|$|Spending {{and loan}} {{guarantees}} from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department {{authorized by the}} Bush and Obama administrations totaled about $11.5trillion, but only $3trillion was spent {{by the end of}} November 2009. <b>Obama</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be $1.5trillion or 10.6% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4trillion or 9.9% of GDP. For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit will shrink to $1.34trillion, and the 10-year deficit will increase to $8.53trillion or 90% of GDP. The most recent increase in the U.S. debt ceiling to $17.2trillion took effect in February 2014. On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings. By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.|$|E
5|$|The {{protests against}} the Sri Lankan Civil War in Canada, often {{referred}} to as the Tamil protests by the media, consisted of a series of demonstrations which took place in major Canadian cities with a significant Tamil diaspora population during the year 2009 protesting the alleged genocide of Sri Lankan Tamil people in the Northern Province of the island nation Sri Lanka. It was part of a global outcry by the Tamil diaspora to end the Sri Lankan Civil War, investigate acts of war crimes by the Government of Sri Lanka, and restore civil rights for Tamils in Sri Lanka. The aim was also to create awareness and appeal to leaders, notably the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, the President of the United States, Barack <b>Obama</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Canada, Bandula Jayasekara, to take action in ending the conflict. Several Tamil Canadian citizens and business-owners from different parts of Canada and the United States took part in major protests set up in Toronto and Ottawa, while smaller scale demonstrations took place in Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary.|$|E

25|$|The December {{results of}} the Des Moines Register's poll also showed a widened gap between the {{three-way}} contest for the lead — Clinton, Edwards, <b>and</b> <b>Obama</b> — <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest of the Democratic candidates.

25|$|In early 2013 Edward Snowden {{leaked to}} the media a trove of {{documents}} on the Obama administration's controversial mass surveillance campaign. These revelations have strained relationships between <b>Obama</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> foreign leaders that his administration is spying on. Fears of American spy software have also cost several American companies contracts for export work.|$|E
25|$|Hill {{voted against}} the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which created the Troubled Asset Relief Program ("Wall Street bailout"). Hill {{supported}} the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (Waxman-Markey), a cap-and-trade bill which ultimately did not pass. Hill also voted for the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (an economic stimulus package championed by President <b>Obama)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, landmark health care reform legislation.|$|E

25|$|Another notable {{action of}} his term was a strict new ethics law. When campaigning for {{re-election}} in 2006, Blagojevich said that if his ethics law had existed when former governor George Ryan had been in office, Ryan's corruption might not have occurred. Blagojevich also signed a comprehensive death penalty reform bill that was written by then-Senator Barack <b>Obama</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> late U.S. Senator Paul M. Simon. Organized labor and African Americans were Blagojevich's staunchest political supporters. In 2008, he {{told a group of}} African-Americans that he sometimes considered himself the first African American governor of Illinois.|$|E
25|$|After the {{election}} of Obama for president, Republicans in Congress were unified in almost total opposition to the programs and policies of <b>Obama</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Democratic majority. They unsuccessfully attempted to stop an $814 billion stimulus spending program, new regulations on investment firms, and a program to require health insurance for all Americans. They did keep emissions trading from coming to a vote, and vow {{to continue to work}} to convince Americans that burning fossil fuel does not cause global warming. The slow growth of the economy {{in the first two years}} of the Obama administration led Republicans to call for a return to tax cuts and deregulation of businesses, which they perceived as the best way to solve the financial crisis. Obama's approval rating steadily declined in his first year in office before leveling off at about 50-50. This decline in popularity led to a GOP landslide in the mid-term elections of 2010.|$|E
50|$|Cynthia Akuetteh (born 1948) is {{a diplomat}} and United States Ambassador to São Tomé and Príncipe and United States Ambassador to Gabon. She was {{nominated}} by President <b>Obama</b> <b>and</b> confirmed by <b>the</b> Senate in 2014.|$|R

25|$|The {{participants}} were Hillary Clinton, Barack <b>Obama</b> <b>and</b> John Edwards. <b>The</b> debate, chaired by Wolf Blitzer, had an unusual format; {{for the last}} forty minutes the candidates sat down <b>and</b> <b>the</b> debate took a much more casual tone.|$|R
