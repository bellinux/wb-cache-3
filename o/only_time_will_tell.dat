25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the North African Sephardic dialect was, {{until the early}} 20th century, also highly conservative; its {{abundant}} Colloquial Arabic loan words retained most of the Arabic phonemes as functional components of a new, enriched Hispano-Semitic phonological system. During the Spanish colonial occupation of Northern Morocco (1912–1956), Ḥakitía was subjected to pervasive, massive influence from Modern Standard Spanish and most Moroccan Jews now speak a colloquial, Andalusian form of Spanish, with only an occasional use of the old language {{as a sign of}} in-group solidarity, somewhat as American Jews may now use an occasional Yiddishism in colloquial speech. Except for certain younger individuals, who continue to practice Ḥakitía as a matter of cultural pride, this splendid dialect, probably the most Arabized of the Romance languages apart from Mozarabic, has essentially ceased to exist. By contrast, Eastern Judeo-Spanish has fared somewhat better, especially in Israel, where newspapers, radio broadcasts, and elementary school and university programs strive to keep the language alive. But the old regional variations (i.e. Bosnia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and Turkey for instance) are already either extinct or doomed to extinction. <b>Only</b> <b>time</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> whether Judeo-Spanish koiné, now evolving in Israel—similar to that which developed among Sephardic immigrants to the United States early in the 20th century will prevail and survive into the next generation.|$|E
500|$|... "You're Mine (Eternal)" [...] {{garnered}} {{a generally}} positive response amongst music critics. Christina Garibaldi of MTV News was complimentary of the song, praising Carey's [...] "impressive" [...] vocal range and specifically {{drawing attention to}} the high note that she ends the song with. Garibaldi stated that [...] "You're Mine (Eternal)" [...] serves as a reminder as to why Carey is [...] "still the fiercest diva in the game". Writing for Billboard, Jason Lipshutz noted that the slow structure {{for the majority of}} the song could have made it a [...] "sleepy" [...] R song, but noted that the [...] "inevitable" [...] high note saves it from becoming so. Jamieson Cox of Time echoed Garibaldi's sentiments, writing [...] "It's a gaseous, fluffy ballad that feels like a direct descendant of the song that rang in her mid-career renaissance, 2005's mega-hit 'We Belong Together': plinking piano melodies, a typically fluttering Carey vocal take, and a very similar beat. <b>Only</b> <b>time</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> if 'You're Mine (Eternal)' can duplicate that song's record-breaking success".|$|E

5000|$|By contrast, NME found Low [...] "stunningly {{beautiful}} ... {{the sound}} of Sinatra reproduced by Martian computers".

John Rockwell of The New York Times wrote that [...] "There are hardly any vocals, and what there are mostly mindless doggerel heard from afar. And the instrumentals are strange and spacey. Nevertheless, the whole thing strikes this listener as remarkably, alluringly beautiful". Rockwell described its sound as [...] "a strange crossbreed of Roxy Music, Eno's own solo albums, Talking Heads and an Indonesian gamelan. Yet it still is recognizably a David Bowie album", and concluded that [...] "once Mr. Bowie's fans overcome their initial shock at his latest change in direction, they may realize that he's made one of the finest disks of his career".|$|R

2500|$|In 2006 a {{post-mortem}} inquest {{into the}} death of Carol Cross at age 58, who was exposed to the contaminated drinking water aged 44, showed that her brain contained 23 micrograms of aluminium per gram of brain, compared to the normal brain levels of 0–2 micrograms per gram. Her death {{was caused by a}} form of early-onset beta amyloid angiopathy, a cerebro-vascular disease usually associated with Alzheimer's, which could be connected to the abnormally high level of aluminium in her brain. Michael Rose, the West Somerset Coroner, said of the findings: [...] "Further research will be needed before the significance of the elevated brain aluminium concentration in this case can be clarified. A scientific report on the case has been submitted for publication." [...] Daniel Perl, of New York's Mount Sinai School of Medicine said: [...] "If additional similar cases were to appear among the 20,000 exposed individuals then the implications of this incident would become extremely important. <b>Only</b> <b>time</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell.</b> At the very least, increased efforts towards surveillance of individuals exposed in Camelford is certainly warranted." ...|$|E

40|$|The list {{of animal}} viruses has been {{frequently}} added of new members raising permanent concerns to virologists and veterinarians. The pathogenic potential and association with disease have been clearly demonstrated for some, {{but not for}} all of these emerging viruses. This review describes recent discoveries of animal viruses and their potential relevance for veterinary practice. Dogs were considered refractory to influenza viruses until 2004, when an influenza A virus subtype H 3 N 8 was transmitted from horses and produced severe respiratory disease in racing greyhounds in Florida/USA. The novel virus, named canine influenza virus (CIV), is considered now a separate virus lineage and has spread among urban canine population in the USA. A new pestivirus (Flaviviridae), tentatively called HoBi-like pestivirus, was identified in 2004 in commercial fetal bovine serum from Brazil. Hobi-like viruses are genetically and antigenically related to bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and induce similar clinical manifestations. These novel viruses seem to be widespread in Brazilian herds and have also been detected in Southeast Asia and Europe. In 2011, a novel mosquito-borne orthobunyavirus, named Schmallenberg virus (SBV), was associated with fever, drop in milk production, abortion and newborn malformation in cattle and sheep in Germany. Subsequently, the virus disseminated over several European countries and currently represents a real treat for animal health. The origin of SBV is still a matter of debate but it may be a reassortant from previous known bunyaviruses Shamonda and Satuperi. Hepatitis E virus (HEV, family Hepeviridae) is a long known agent of human acute hepatitis and in 1997 was first identified in pigs. Current data indicates that swine HEV is spread worldwide, mainly associated with subclinical infection. Two of the four HEV genotypes are zoonotic and may be transmitted between swine and human by contaminated water and undercooked pork meat. The current distribution and impact of HEV infection in swine production are largely unknown. Avian gyrovirus type 2 (AGV 2) is a newly described Gyrovirus, family Circoviridae, which was unexpectedly found in sera of poultry suspected to be infected with chicken anemia virus (CAV). AGV 2 is closely related to CAV but displays sufficient genomic differences to be classified as a distinct species. AGV 2 seems to be distributed in Brazil and also in other countries but its pathogenic role for chickens is still under investigation. Finally, the long time and intensive search for animal relatives of human hepatitis C virus (HCV) has led to the identification of novel hepaciviruses in dogs (canine hepacivirus [CHV]), horses (non-primate hepaciviruses [NPHV] or Theiler's disease associated virus [TDAV]) and rodents. For these, a clear and definitive association with disease is still lacking and <b>only</b> <b>time</b> and investigation <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> whether they are real disease agents or simple spectators...|$|R
