5|$|Even more remarkably, {{there is}} a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics, which is {{analogous}} to the laws of thermodynamics. For instance, by the second law <b>of</b> <b>black</b> hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the Penrose process). There is strong evidence that the laws <b>of</b> <b>black</b> hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy. This leads to a modification of the original laws <b>of</b> <b>black</b> hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law <b>of</b> <b>black</b> hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decreaseâ€”as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit thermal radiation. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck's law. This radiation is known as Hawking radiation (cf. the quantum theory section, below).|$|E

Recently, many African immigrants have been coming to Cuba, especially from Angola. Also, immigrants from Jamaica and Haiti have been settling in Cuba, most of whom settle {{in the eastern part of}} the island, due to its proximity to their home countries, further contributing to the already high percentage <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> on that side of the island.|$|R
5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising {{the great majority}} <b>of</b> <b>black</b> men.

50|$|Maryland had an {{increasing}} proportion <b>of</b> free <b>blacks</b> among its African-American population. During {{the first two}} decades after the Revolution, about 25% <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> were freed, in part because slaveholders were inspired by the war's ideals. Practically, changing labor needs meant that fewer slaves were required. By 1810 some 30% <b>of</b> North Maryland's <b>blacks</b> were free, in what was a more urbanized region, but so were 20% <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> {{in the southern part}} of the state. In the next two decades the number <b>of</b> free <b>blacks</b> increased markedly in the northern part of the state, and many congregated to Baltimore, the state's and the South's largest city. By 1830 Maryland had a total of 52,938 free blacks: 51.3% <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> in North Maryland were free, and the <b>black</b> population <b>of</b> Baltimore was 75% free. In South Maryland, free blacks made up 24.7% <b>of</b> the <b>black</b> population.|$|R

40|$|Can we {{determine}} a spin parameter <b>of</b> a <b>black</b> hole by observation <b>of</b> a <b>black</b> hole shadow in an accretion disk? In order {{to answer this}} question, we make a qualitative analysis and a quantitative analysis of a shape and a position <b>of</b> a <b>black</b> hole shadow casted by a rotating black hole on an optically thick accretion disk and its dependence on an angular momentum <b>of</b> a <b>black</b> hole. We have found black hole shadows with a quite similar size and a shape for largely different black hole spin parameters and a same black hole mass. Thus, it is practically difficult to {{determine a}} spin parameter <b>of</b> a <b>black</b> hole from a size and a shape <b>of</b> a <b>black</b> hole shadow in an accretion disk. We newly introduce a bisector axis <b>of</b> a <b>black</b> hole shadow named a shadow axis. For a rotating black hole a shape and a position <b>of</b> a <b>black</b> hole shadow are not symmetric {{with respect to a}} rotation axis <b>of</b> a <b>black</b> hole shadow. So, in this case the minimum interval between a mass center <b>of</b> a <b>black</b> hole and a shadow axis is finite. An extent of this minimum interval is roughly proportional to a spin parameter <b>of</b> a <b>black</b> hole for a fixed inclination angle between a rotation axis <b>of</b> a <b>black</b> hole and a direction of an observer. In order to measure a spin parameter <b>of</b> a <b>black</b> hole, if a shadow axis is determined observationally, it is crucially important to determine a position of a mass center <b>of</b> a <b>black</b> hole in a region <b>of</b> a <b>black</b> hole shadow.

We find that white veterans express more negative views <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> relative to white civilians and that white veterans in the AVF generation exhibit the most negative views <b>of</b> <b>blacks.</b> Taken together, we believe that our results suggest a reassessment {{of the role of}} contemporary military experiences in liberalizing white racial attitudes and offer support for the self-selection perspective...|$|R
