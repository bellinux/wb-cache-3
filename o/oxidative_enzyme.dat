Neural tissues depend on this process for energy, and {{disruption of the}} cycle would impair cell growth and function. Schwann cells produce myelin that wraps around the sensory and motor nerve axons to enhance action potential conduction in the periphery. An energy deficiency in Schwann cells would account for the disappearance of myelin on peripheral nerves, which may result in damage to axons or loss of nerve function altogether. In peripheral nerves, <b>oxidative</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity is most concentrated around the nodes of Ranvier, making these locations most vulnerable to cofactor deprivation. Lacking essential cofactors reduces myelin impedance, increases current leakage, and slows signal transmission. Disruptions in conductance first affect the peripheral ends of the longest and largest peripheral nerve fibers because they suffer most from decreased action potential propagation. Thus, neural deterioration occurs in an accelerating cycle: myelin damage reduces conductance, and reduced conductance contributes to myelin degradation. The slowed conduction of action potentials in axons causes segmental demyelination extending proximally; this {{is also known as}} retrograde degeneration.|$|E

5000|$|In lignan biosynthesis, <b>oxidative</b> <b>enzymes</b> perform proton coupled {{electron}} transfer {{to remove a}} hydrogen atom from monolignols, forming a radical intermediate. These intermediates then couple in a radical termination reaction to form one {{of a variety of}} dimers, known as lignans. In vitro reactions of coniferyl alcohol (a common monolignol) in the presence of <b>oxidative</b> <b>enzymes</b> produce a wide variety of different dimers at varying concentrations. When dirigent protein from [...] "Forsythia intermedia" [...] is present, production of (+)-pinoresinol is greatly enriched, and other products are far less abundant. Because this enrichment is so pronounced, the enzyme is hypothesized to produce (+)-pinoresinol exclusively, and to compete with the non-protein-mediated coupling reaction, which produces a heterologous mix of products. This has been confirmed by analyzing the various mixtures produced with different concentrations of dirigent proteins present. The mechanism by which this stereoselectivity is achieved is not well understood at this time. However, since no reaction proceeds in the absence of <b>oxidative</b> <b>enzymes,</b> dirigent protein does not itself appear to catalyze the oxidation of coniferyl alcohol to form radicals.|$|R

50|$|The {{regulation}} of bio-luminescence in bacteria is achieved through the {{regulation of}} the <b>oxidative</b> <b>enzyme</b> called luciferase. It is important that bio-luminescent bacteria decrease production rates of luciferase when the population is sparse in number in order to conserve energy. Thus, bacterial bioluminescence is regulated by means of chemical communication referred to as quorum sensing. Essentially, certain signaling molecules named autoinducers with specific bacterial receptors become activated when the population density of bacteria is high enough. The activation of these receptors leads to a coordinated induction of luciferase production that ultimately yields visible luminescence.|$|E

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the contractile apparatus, studies on various rodent skeletal muscle metabolic enzymes have revealed a variety of responses with no clear-cut adaptive changes in <b>oxidative</b> <b>enzyme</b> expression. These observations {{are consistent with the}} results of studies focusing on mitochondrial function after 9 days of spaceflight in which no reduction in the capacity of skeletal muscle mitochondria to metabolize pyruvate (a carbohydrate derivative) [...] was observed. These analyses were carried out under state 3 metabolic conditions, that is, non-limiting amounts of substrate and cofactors to simulate an energy turnover demand similar to that of high-intensity exercise. However, when a fatty acid substrate was tested, a reduction in the capacity of different muscle types to oxidize the long-chain fatty acid, palmitate, was observed. This latter finding is in agreement with the observation that muscles exposed to spaceflight increase the level of stored lipid within their myofibers. Additionally, use of the metabolic pathway for glucose uptake is increased in muscles undergoing HS. Thus, while the enzyme data are equivocal, it appears that in response to states of unloading, some shift in substrate preference may occur whereby carbohydrates are preferentially utilized based on utilization capability. If this is indeed the case, it could result in a greater tendency for muscle fatigue, should the carbohydrate stores become limited during prolonged bouts of EVA activity.|$|E

[...] While fungi can breakdown many of these contaminants intracellularly, they also secrete numerous oxidative exoenzymes that work extracellularly. One critical aspect of fungi in regards to bioremediation is that they secrete these oxidative exoenzymes from their ever elongating hyphal tips. [...] Laccases are an important <b>oxidative</b> <b>enzyme</b> that fungi secrete and use oxygen to oxidize many pollutants. Some of the pollutants that laccases have been used to treat include dye-containing effluents from the textile industry, wastewater pollutants (chlorophenols, PAHs, etc.), and sulphur-containing compounds from coal processing.Bacteria are also a viable source of exoenzymes capable to facilitating the bioremediation of the environment. There are many examples of the use of bacteria for this purpose and their exoenzymes encompass many different classes of bacterial enzymes. Of particular interest in this field are bacterial hydrolases as they have an intrinsic low substrate specificity and can be used for numerous pollutants including solid wastes. [...] Plastic wastes including polyurethanes are particularly hard to degrade, but an exoenzyme has been identified in a Gram-negative bacterium, Comamonas acidovorans, that was capable of degrading polyurethane waste in the environment. [...] Cell-free use of microbial exoenzymes as agents of bioremediation is also possible although their activity is often not as robust and introducing the enzymes into certain environments such as soil has been challenging.

40|$|Abstract Background The recent {{discovery}} of accessory proteins that boost cellulose hydrolysis {{has increased the}} economical and technical efficiency of processing cellulose to bioethanol. <b>Oxidative</b> <b>enzymes</b> (e. g. GH 61) present in new commercial enzyme preparations have shown to increase cellulose conversion yields. When using pure cellulose substrates it has been determined that both oxidized and unoxidized cellodextrin products are formed. We report the effect of oxidative activity in a commercial enzyme mix (Cellic CTec 2) upon overall hydrolysis, formation of oxidized products and impact on β-glucosidase activity. The experiments were done at high solids loadings using a lignocellulosic substrate simulating commercially relevant conditions. Results The Cellic CTec 2 contained <b>oxidative</b> <b>enzymes</b> which produce gluconic acid from lignocellulose. Both gluconic and cellobionic acid were produced during hydrolysis of pretreated wheat straw at 30 % WIS. Up to 4 % of released glucose was oxidized into gluconic acid using Cellic CTec 2, whereas no oxidized products were detected when using an earlier cellulase preparation Celluclast/Novozym 188. However, the cellulose conversion yield was 25 % lower using Celluclast/Novozym 188 compared to Cellic CTec 2. Despite {{the advantage of the}} <b>oxidative</b> <b>enzymes,</b> it was shown that aldonic acids could be problematic to the hydrolytic enzymes. Hydrolysis experiments revealed that cellobionic acid was hydrolyzed by β-glucosidase at a rate almost 10 -fold lower than for cellobiose, and the formed gluconic acid was an inhibitor of the β-glucosidase. Interestingly, the level of gluconic acid varied significantly with temperature. At 50 °C (SHF conditions) 35 % less gluconic acid was produced compared to at 33 °C (SSF conditions). We also found that in the presence of lignin, no reducing agent was needed for the function of the <b>oxidative</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Conclusions The presence of <b>oxidative</b> <b>enzymes</b> in Cellic CTec 2 {{led to the formation of}} cellobionic and gluconic acid during hydrolysis of pretreated wheat straw and filter paper. Gluconic acid was a stronger inhibitor of β-glucosidase than glucose. The formation of oxidized products decreased as the hydrolysis temperature was increased from 33 ° to 50 °C. Despite end-product inhibition, the oxidative cleavage of the cellulose chains has a synergistic effect upon the overall hydrolysis of cellulose as the sugar yield increased compared to using an <b>enzyme</b> preparation without <b>oxidative</b> activity. </p...|$|R

In this study, degradation of corn cob by Sporothrix carnis and involvement of lignocellulolytic enzymes in biodegradation were investigated over 240 [*]h cultivation period. About 60 % degradation of corn cob was achieved by S. carnis at the end of fermentation. The yields of hydrolytic enzymes, cellulase and xylanase, were higher than <b>oxidative</b> <b>enzymes,</b> laccase and peroxidase, over 144 [*]h fermentation period. Maximum yields of cellulase (854. 4 [*]U/mg) and xylanase (789. 6 [*]U/mg) were at 96 and 144 [*]h, respectively. Laccase and peroxidase were produced cooperatively with maximum yields of 489. 06 [*]U/mg and 585. 39 [*]U/mg at 144 [*]h.
