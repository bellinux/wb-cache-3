40|$|AIM: To analyze electrocardiographic {{features}} of patients diagnosed with {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD) after the Van-Erci&#x 15 F; earthquake, with a shock measuring 7. 2 on the Richter scale {{that took place in}} Turkey in October 2011. METHODS: Surface electrocardiograms of 12 patients with PTSD admitted to Van Erci&#x 15 F; State Hospital (Van, Turkey) from February 2012 to May 2012 were examined. Psychiatric interviews of the sex and age matched control subjects, who had experienced the earthquake, confirmed the absence of any known diagnosable psychiatric conditions in the control group. RESULTS: A wide range of electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, such as P-wave dispersion, QT dispersion, QT interval, Tpeak to Tend interval, intrinsicoid deflection durations and other traditional parameters were similar in both groups. There was no one with an abnormal P wave axis, short or long PR interval, long or short QT interval, negative T wave in lateral leads, abnormal T wave axis, abnormal left or right intrinsicoid deflection duration, low voltage, left bundle branch block, right bundle branch block, left posterior hemiblock, left or right axis deviation, left ventricular hypertrophy, right or left atrial enlargement and pathological q(Q) wave in either group. CONCLUSION: The study showed no direct effect of earthquake related PTSD <b>on</b> <b>surface</b> <b>ECG</b> in young patients. So, we propose that PTSD has no direct effect <b>on</b> <b>surface</b> <b>ECG</b> but may cause electrocardiographic changes indirectly by triggering atherosclerosis and/or contributing to the ongoing atherosclerotic process...|$|E

Using a database of 30 [*]min ECG recorded from 500 patients with acute myocardial infraction during rest, we extracted RR and QT interval time series and estimated different HRV and QTV metrics over windows of varying length. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and intra-class correlation analyses were computed to investigate the effect of recording length on consistency and short-term reproducibility of HRV and QTV variables. Good consistency (non-significant ANOVA results) and short-term reproducibility (intra-class correlation coefficients[*][*]> 0. 8) were demonstrated for all but standard deviation based metrics when at least 200 beats were included in the estimation. In conclusion, QTV can be quantified from resting ECG with good short-term consistency and reproducibility that is comparable to that of HRV.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present {{popularity}} of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation has generated {{interest in the}} pathophysiology of arrhythmias originating from the left atrium. An improved understanding of ECG manifestations of reentrant left atrial arrhythmias has obvious clinical implications. An ideal goal would be to achieve diagnostic precision similar to the 'sawtooth' ECG morphology of typical atrial flutter. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent {{studies have shown that}} nonreentrant arrhythmias originating from the left atrium are characterized by specific ECG features of the P wave, the most consistent being a positive or a dominantly positive deflection in V 1. Similarly, bystander activation of the right atrium generates a dominantly positive deflection in V 1 even during left atrial reentry. Although continuous reentrant activation should generate continuous electrical activity <b>on</b> <b>surface</b> <b>ECG,</b> {{this may not be the}} case if part of the reentry circuit generates feeble electrical forces, for example, a thin strand of myocardium. As a result, discrete P waves separated by a 12 -lead synchronous isoelectric interval may be produced. Their morphology can be used to infer the location of the exit from this slow-conducting isthmus and facilitate ablation. SUMMARY: The progressive accumulation of accurate activation mapping data of the full spectrum of left atrial reentry will certainly allow the development of clinically useful ECG algorithms...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the P-wave <b>on</b> <b>surface</b> <b>ECG</b> is widely {{used to assess the}} risk of atrial arrhythmias. In order to provide reliable results, the automatic {{analysis of}} the P-wave must be precise and reliable and must take into account technical aspects, one of those being the resolution of the acquisition system. The aim of this note is to investigate the effects of the amplitude resolution of ECG acquisition systems on the P-wave analysis. Starting from ECG recorded by an acquisition system with a less significant bit (LSB) of 31 nV (24 bit on an input range of 524 mVpp), we reproduced an ECG signal as acquired by systems with lower resolution (16, 15, 14, 13 and 12 bit). We found that, when the LSB is of the order of 128 µV (12 bit), a single P-wave is not recognizable on ECG. However, when averaging is applied, a P-wave template can be extracted, apparently suitable for the P-wave analysis. Results obtained in terms of P-wave duration and morphology revealed that the analysis of ECG at lowest resolutions (from 12 to 14 bit, LSB higher than 30 µV) could lead to misleading results. However, the resolution used nowadays in modern electrocardiographs (15 and 16 bit, LSB < 10 µV) is sufficient for the reliable {{analysis of the}} P-wave...|$|E

Lead V 1 adequately reflects right atrial activity, but reliable tools for noninvasive estimation of right versus left fibrillatory frequency are lacking. In this study, patients with dissociated left and right atrial rhythms were studied {{in order to identify}} which surface electrocardiographic (ECG) leads that most closely reflect the left atrial activity. Methods: Two consecutive patients with atrial tachycardia confined to the left atrial appendage (LAA) detected during catheter ablation of AF were included (2 men, 54 and 72 years old). A 12 -lead ECG was recorded simultaneously with electrograms from the right and left atrial appendages (RAA/LAA). AF frequency spectra were calculated from all 12 leads using spatiotemporal QRST cancellation and Welch periodogram. The dominating atrial cycle length (DACL) in the surface ECG leads was subsequently compared with the invasively measured LAA cycle length. Results: LAA activation frequency was seen as a prominent peak in the frequency–power spectrum derived from frontal plane leads as well as lead V 1. The absolute difference in noninvasively and invasively measured LAA cycle length was lowest for leads aVR, II, aVF, III, and V 1 in which it was in the range of 2 – 4 ms. Conclusion: Prominent left atrial component is present in the majority of standard ECG leads, including those traditionally associated with right atrial activity such as V 1.

DESIGN: An observational study. SETTING: Tertiary care centre. PATIENTS: 81 patients with previous myocardial infarction and depressed LV function. INTERVENTIONS: All patients underwent surface ECG at rest and pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging at rest and during low dose dobutamine infusion. The left ventricle was divided into four major regions (anterior, inferoposterior, septal, and lateral). Severely hypokinetic, akinetic, and dyskinetic regions on two dimensional echocardiography at rest were considered dysfunctional. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Regional myocardial systolic velocity (Vs) at rest and the change in Vs during low dose dobutamine infusion (DeltaVs) in dysfunctional regions with and without Q waves <b>on</b> <b>surface</b> <b>ECG.</b> RESULTS: 220 (69 %) regions were dysfunctional; 60 of these regions corresponded to Q waves and 160 were not related to Q waves.

40|$|International audienceRadiofrequency {{catheter}} ablation (CA) {{is increasingly}} employed to treat persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), yet selection {{of patients who}} would positively respond to this therapy is currently a critical problem. Several parameters of the surface 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) have been analyzed in previous works to predict AF termination by CA. Nevertheless, they are affected by some limitations, such as manual computation and the examination of a single ECG lead while neglecting contributions from other electrodes. AF spatio-temporal organization has been described <b>on</b> <b>surface</b> <b>ECG</b> {{by means of the}} normalized mean square error (NMSE) between consecutive atrial activity (AA) signal segments and their reduced-rank approximations based on principal component analysis (PCA). However, these features do not show to be correlated with CA outcome. In this study, such descriptors are adequately adapted and applied to CA outcome prediction. An NMSE index is put forward, computed over the set of eight linearly independent ECG leads after AA signal rank- 1 approximations determined by weighted principal component analysis (WPCA). The final predictor is able to discriminate between successful (70. 76 ± 17. 74) and failing CA procedures (37. 54 ± 20. 01) before performing the ablation (p-value = 0. 0013, AUC = 0. 91). The proposed WPCA-based technique emphasizes the most descriptive components of AF electrophysiology by selectively enhancing contributions coming from the most representative ECG leads. Our investigation confirms that ECG spatial diversity exploitation in this WPCA-based framework not only endows the NMSE index with clinical value in the context of CA outcome prediction, but it also improves classification accuracy and increases robustness to ECG lead selection...|$|E
