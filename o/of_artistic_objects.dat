5|$|Sociology of literature, film, and art is {{a subset}} of the {{sociology}} of culture. This field studies the social production <b>of</b> <b>artistic</b> <b>objects</b> and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire, translated by Susan Emanuel as Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field (1996). None of the founding fathers of sociology produced a detailed study of art, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalization, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim.|$|E

It was a large room, nearly square, with cream-coloured walls and dark red dado, and a polished floor, partly covered with a Turkish carpet; but there was very little furniture in it, and the atmosphere seemed chill and heavy, for it was the old unrenewed air of a room that was never used. On a large centre table a number <b>of</b> <b>artistic</b> <b>objects</b> were lying together in a promiscuous jumble: Japanese knick-knacks; an ivory card-case that had lost its cover, and a broken- bladed paper-knife; glove and collar and work-boxes of sandal-wood, mother-of-pearl, and papier-mâché, with broken hinges; faded fans and chipped paper-weights; gorgeous picture-books with loosened covers, and a magnificent portrait-album which had been deflowered and had nothing left in it but the old and ugly, the commonplace middle-aged, and the vapid young; with many other things besides, all more or less defective.|$|E

40|$|In {{this text}} I present the poem by Zbigniew Herbert "Ołtarz" as a text whose style and line {{structure}} refer to "Bema pamięci żałobny rapsod" by Cyprian Kamil Norwid. The poem from 19 th century puts a special meaning as "the most outstanding realisation of Polish hexameter" to contemporary works. The hexameter {{that comes from}} ancient tradition (Homer) evokes associations connected with it: seriousness, pathos and also the distance to described events. Using the hexameter is an important clue of an author who gives information about understanding of innate "I" expression {{on the level of}} style, rhythm and line structure of a poem ("a gesture" of restriation to regular form). Such poetic strategy gives Herbert a possibility of expressing his pessimistic and ironic opinions about art - "self-possessed poet" has a possibility <b>of</b> <b>artistic</b> <b>object</b> description which is not “a monument impossible to be destroyed", on the contrary - it is an object that is under the destructive power of time...|$|R

40|$|This work {{is funded}} by the University of Malta, under the {{research}} grant SCERP 02 - 03. Vectorization algorithms described in the literature assume that the drawings being vectorized are either binary images or have a clear white background. Sketches <b>of</b> <b>artistic</b> <b>objects</b> however also contain shadows which help the artist to portray intent, particularly in potentially ambiguous sketches. Such sketches are difficult to binarise since the shading strokes make these sketches non bimodal. For this reason, we describe a circle-based vectorization algorithm that uses signatures obtained from sample points on the line strokes to identify and vectorize the line strokes in the sketch. We show that the proposed algorithm performs {{as well as other}} vectorization techniques described in the literature, despite the shadows present in the sketch. peer-reviewe...|$|E

The idea that the artistic representation is composed of [...] "simulacra", objects in which the internal relation between the signifier and the signified is not direct, created a feeling that the status <b>of</b> the <b>artistic</b> <b>object</b> in general, and of sculpture in particular, was being undermined.|$|R

40|$|Writings on {{landscape}} tend {{to express}} engrained human attitudes towards plants. The theme ‘thinking about {{writing for the}} anthropocene’ suggests that, for us to explore new models of writing landscape that give agency to plants, we need first to explore the philosophical underpinnings of our varied relationships to flora. This need is especially evident in the branch of ecological philosophy known as ‘landscape’ or ‘environmental aesthetics’. The flowering plant has been represented textually and visually with vocabularies inherited from the appreciation <b>of</b> <b>artistic</b> <b>objects.</b> In the Southwest of Australia, plants have been objectified, dismissed or aestheticised in representation, depending on their adherence to traditional ideas of beauty. A more enlivened writing about plants emerges from new conceptualisations of the human perception of flora. The act of writing itself becomes a form of enquiry into the human-plant relationship...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{describes}} the technique developed for applying garnet powder abrasive ultra-high pressure water jet advanced technology (AWJ) to build accurate models <b>of</b> <b>artistic</b> <b>objects.</b> The objects to be modeled {{have been selected}} through a cooperative initiative between the University of Sao Paulo and entities of the private sector. The first application was the reproduction of the artistic floor of marble at the St. Mark's Basilica, Venice, Italy. The other application was the production of official trophies for a technical awards ceremony for a national symposium {{that took place in}} Brazil. The trophies were made in stainless steel, whilst the floor reproduction was made in ceramic tiles. The floor was reproduced from high-definition photography of the original floor. The design concept and the blueprints of the trophies were originally conceived by the symposium organizers. Both models have been built using OMAX CAD/CAM Software, which controls an AWJ unit installed at the University of São Paulo, where the procedures for building both models have been developed and executed with high success. 1...|$|E

It thus considers readings of ‘feather mosaic’ as only iconographic manifestations referring back to European traditions to be incomplete. A study of The Mass of Saint Gregory, Viceroyalty of New Spain draws our attention to the polysemy of these images. The article emphasizes the need to explore new ways of reading that enable us to get closer to indigenous meanings, which have often gone unnoticed. In this way, it proposes to take into account aspects such as the artistic techniques and the types of feathers used, as well as the colors, forms and ‘iconographic’ motifs of the images. By stressing that these images were created with feathers, whose meaning should not be avoided, this article questions the division between content and form...|$|E
