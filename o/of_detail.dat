5|$|Heyer {{essentially}} {{established the}} historical romance genre and its subgenre Regency romance. Her Regencies {{were inspired by}} Jane Austen, but unlike Austen, who wrote about and for the times in which she lived, Heyer was forced to include copious information about the period so that her readers would understand the setting. To ensure accuracy, Heyer collected reference works and kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life. While some critics thought the novels were too detailed, others considered the level <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> to be Heyer's greatest asset. Her meticulous nature was also evident in her historical novels; Heyer even recreated William the Conqueror's crossing into England for her novel The Conqueror.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Sid Meier {{released}} Civilization and popularized {{the level}} <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> {{that has become}} a staple of the genre. Sid Meier's Civilization was influenced by board games such as Risk and the Avalon Hill board game also called Civilization. A notable similarity between the Civilization computer game and board game is the importance of diplomacy and technological advancement. Sid Meier's Civilization was also influenced by personal computer games such as the city management game SimCity and the wargame Empire. Civilization became widely successful and influenced many 4X games to come.|$|E

40|$|In the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, measuring {{the importance of}} informative and persuasive roles <b>of</b> <b>detailing</b> is crucial for both drug manufacturers and policy makers. However, little {{progress has been made}} in disentangling between informative and persuasive roles <b>of</b> <b>detailing.</b> In this paper, we provide a new identification strategy to separately identify these two roles. Our key identification assumption is that the informative component <b>of</b> <b>detailing</b> is chemical specific while the persuasive component is brand specific. Our strategy is to focus on markets where some drug manufacturers engage in a co-marketing agreement. Under a co-marketing agreement, two companies market the same chemical under two different brand-names. With our identification assumption, the relative market share of these two brands, together with their individual detailing efforts, would allow us to measure the persuasive component <b>of</b> <b>detailing.</b> The total market share of the chemical, and the sum <b>of</b> the brand-specific <b>detailing</b> efforts for this chemical, would allow us to measure the informative component <b>of</b> <b>detailing.</b> To demonstrate our identification strategy, we estimate two structural models <b>of</b> <b>detailing</b> and prescribing decisions that have been used in the literature, using monthly product level data on sales, prices, and detailing minutes for ACE-inhibitor with diuretic in Canada.

40|$|The {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>detailed</b> balance {{states that}} in equilibrium each elementary process is equilibrated by its reverse process. For many real physico-chemical complex systems (e. g. homogeneous combustion, heterogeneous catalytic oxidation, most enzyme reactions etc), detailed mechanisms include both reversible and irreversible reactions. In this case, the principle <b>of</b> <b>detailed</b> balance cannot be applied directly. We represent irreversible reactions as limits of reversible steps and obtain the principle <b>of</b> <b>detailed</b> balance for complex mechanisms with some irreversible elementary processes. We proved two consequences <b>of</b> the <b>detailed</b> balance for these mechanisms: the structural {{condition and the}} algebraic condition that form together the extended form <b>of</b> <b>detailed</b> balance. The algebraic condition is the principle <b>of</b> <b>detailed</b> balance for the reversible part. The structural condition is: the convex hull of the stoichiometric vectors of the irreversible reactions has empty intersection with the linear span of the stoichiometric vectors of the reversible reaction. Physically, {{this means that the}} irreversible reactions cannot be included in oriented pathways. The systems with the extended form <b>of</b> <b>detailed</b> balance are also the limits of the reversible systems with detailed balance when some of the equilibrium concentrations (or activities) tend to zero. Surprisingly, the structure of the limit reaction mechanism crucially depends on the relative speeds of this tendency to zero.
