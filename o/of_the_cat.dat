50|$|Another {{study to}} test whether the ALVAC {{recombinant}} canarypox virus could prime the immune system in cats was performed. This vaccine has the same hemagglutinin as the H5N1 virus, and therefore worked on preventing death from two different strains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virus, HPAIV A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and HPAIV A/Indonesia/05/2005. However, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cats</b> that were vaccinated did exhibit hyperthermia and weitht loss, and all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cats</b> did have some disease change (assuming lesions) in their lungs.

5|$|In 1988, the {{assumption}} of the subspecies' extinction was challenged when a hunter shot an adult female, proving the species had somehow survived the war. In 1989, scientists surveyed Vietnam's southern forests to search for evidence of other survivors. Fresh tracks belonging to up to 15 rhinos were found along the Dong Nai River. Largely because of the rhinoceros, the region they inhabited became part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> Tien National Park in 1992.|$|E
5|$|The Cat in the Hats {{popularity}} {{also led}} to increased popularity and exposure for Geisel's previous children's books.

5|$|Some breeders {{have shown}} concern {{regarding}} {{the lack of}} genetic diversity in the breed due to inbreeding caused by a small gene pool. Researchers who completed the 2007 DNA {{study found that the}} Singapura (along with the Burmese) have the least genetic diversity among the 22 breeds studied. The possibility of outcrossing with another breed to increase the genetic diversity had been raised among CFA breeders, but not many were receptive to the idea, preferring to use Singapuras from around the world that are not so closely related to the CFA line. In April 2013, UK's Governing Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> Fancy started allowing outcrossing for the breed. Individuals chosen have to meet certain health and appearance requirements.|$|E
5|$|The merger {{was opposed}} by {{consumer}} advocates, {{such as the}} Consumer Federation of America, due to anti-trust concerns.

5|$|After {{damaging}} {{the instrument panel}} with a medical ointment and decapitating the scientist, who {{turns out to be}} an android, Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room of the woman, where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing a Snow White costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him how bad things happen everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls it off and smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large amount of blood and hairballs, which he recognizes as symptoms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> flu and realizes that Sophie infected him. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but he closes the door on him.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} as a girl named Sally and her unnamed brother, who serves as the narrator of the book, sit alone in their house on a cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly {{followed}} by the arrival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish {{on the tip of}} his umbrella. The game quickly becomes more complicated, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the Cat in the Hat just proposes another game.|$|E
5|$|A Bengali folk-tale about Shashthi {{tells of}} the {{youngest}} of seven daughters-in-law in a prosperous household who was a glutton that used to secretly steal food and then blame a black cat, which was thrashed as punishment. The black cat {{happened to be the}} vahana (mount) of Shashthi and complained about the mistreatment to the goddess, who pledged to avenge it. When the youngest daughter-in-law gave birth to a son, the cat stole the child in the night and gave it to the goddess, and did the same for her next six sons. The neighbours accused the young mother of carelessness and began to believe she might be a witch who ate her own children. Finally, when a daughter was born, the young mother decided to remain awake the whole night to resolve the mystery. She managed to catch the cat in the act of robbery and wounded it with her bracelet, but the cat escaped with the child, leaving a trail of blood. The mother followed this trail to the abode of Shashthi. There she saw her sons playing around Shashthi as the goddess held the mother's infant daughter in her arms. Shashthi explained the reason for the mother's ordeal and told her to ask pardon <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat.</b> The mother asked the cat's pardon, which was granted, and then she promised the goddess that she would offer worship in a ritual dedicated to her, which would {{come to be known as}} the Jamai-Shasthi Vrata. The mother returned home with her children and spread the worship of the goddess, who blessed her family with children, wealth and happiness.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to serving as social cues {{between members of}} the same species, Mups can act as kairomonesâchemical signals that transmit information between species. Mice are instinctively afraid of the smell of their natural predators, including cats and rats. This occurs even in laboratory mice that have been isolated from predators for hundreds of generations. When the chemical cues responsible for the fear response were purified from cat saliva and rat urine, two homologous protein signals were identified: Feld4 (Felis domesticus allergen 4), the product <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> Mup gene, and Ratn1 (Rattus norvegicus allergen 1), the product of the rat Mup13 gene. Mice are fearful of these Mups even when they are made in bacteria, but mutant animals that are unable to detect the Mups showed no fear of rats, demonstrating their importance in initiating fearful behaviour. It is not known exactly how Mups from different species initiate disparate behaviours, but mouse Mups and predator Mups have been shown to activate unique patterns of sensory neurons in the nose of recipient mice. This implies the mouse perceives them differently, via distinct neural circuits. The pheromone receptors responsible for Mup detection are also unknown, though they are thought be members of the V2R receptor class.|$|E
5|$|The best {{documented}} {{account of}} these hauntings occurred between 1968 and 1970. The Evening Herald and Evening Press newspapers carried a number of reports regarding a Mrs Margaret O'Brien and her husband Nicholas, a retired Garda superintendent, who were converting the house into an arts centre. The redevelopment had been a troubled affair with tradesmen employed on the work leaving complaining of ghosts. One night, {{a friend of the}} O'Brien's, artist Tom McAssey, and two workmen were confronted by a spectral figure and a black cat with glowing red eyes. McAssey painted a portrait <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> which hung in the house for several years after. Although locals were sceptical of the reports, further apparitions were reported, most notably of an Indian gentleman and of two nuns called Blessed Margaret and Holy Mary who had taken part in black masses on Mount Pelier Hill. There were also reports of ringing bells and poltergeist activity. In 1970 an RTÃ television crew recorded a documentary at the house. In the documentary a clairvoyant called Sheila St. Clair communicated with the spirits of the house through automatic writing. In 1971, a plumber working in the house discovered a grave with a skeleton of a small figure, most likely that of a child or, perhaps, the body of the dwarf alleged to have been sacrificed by the members of the Hell Fire Club. The house operated as a restaurant in the 1990s before closing in 2001; it is now a private residence.|$|E

30|$|To {{inform the}} {{teachers}} about <b>the</b> <b>CATs,</b> a teacher guide was developed describing for each CAT its purpose, {{how and when}} {{it can be used}} in class, and issues on which teachers can focus when observing and checking studentsâ responses. <b>The</b> teacher guide <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> also provided some general background information about formative assessment and <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>CATs.</b> Although detailed instructions were given for using <b>the</b> <b>CATs,</b> <b>the</b> teacher guide <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> was not meant as a fixed recipe for what to do in class. Instead the teachers could adapt <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> to their own needs, which is in line with <b>the</b> finding <b>of</b> Lee and Wiliam (2005) that having teachers decide for themselves about <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> assessment techniques is crucial for <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> their use. Thus, to enhance <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> and stimulate ownership, the teachers could freely decide which CATs to use, when, and in what way.|$|R
