40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} shown that in rat liver {{there are two}} enzymes which phosphorylate glucose to glucose 6 -phosphate. One o f them is a hexokinase with a great af f ini ty for glucose and, like those <b>o</b> f <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> tissues it is inhibited by glucose 6 - phosphate; the other one, named glucokinase, has a low affinity for glucose, is not inhibited by glucose 6 phosphate, {{and appears to be}} responsible for glycogen synthesis from glucose in liver (1). Hexokinase activity exists in both fetal and adult liver whereas glucokinase develops after birth (2). Results from several laboratories have shown that glucokinase activity disappears as a result of fasting and diabet,es and reappears after refeeding or insulin administration, respectively (l- 9), and that this reap- pearance involves synthesis de nouo of the enzyme apparently mediated by insulin (3, 4, 6, 10) Supported by Grant GM- 08041 from the National Institutes of Health, United States Public Health Service.

40|$|What {{calls for}} justice? Are we called {{to do justice}} to <b>other</b> <b>animals?</b> How ought we to {{understand}} and relate to the <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> around us? The work of Jacques Derrida offers a strong foundation from which to consider these questions, and I build on his work by developing a set of clear conceptual tools to understand justice and animality (or animal alterity) through the demands they make on us. I argue that this interrelation between justice and animality can be addressed in a profound way by considering the figure of 2 ̆ 2 the call 2 ̆ 2 —including the calls of <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> and the call of justice. I use the 2 ̆ 2 the call 2 ̆ 2 to offer the reader a tool for opening up their own relations to <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> their responsibilities to them, and the richly differentiated lives of those <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> all of which can be addressed by carefully listening to the call...|$|R
