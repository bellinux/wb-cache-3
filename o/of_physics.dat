5|$|After the war, Goeppert Mayer {{became a}} {{voluntary}} associate professor <b>of</b> <b>Physics</b> at the University of Chicago (where Teller {{and her husband}} worked) and a senior physicist at the nearby Argonne National Laboratory. She developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells, for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, which she shared with J. Hans D. Jensen and Eugene Wigner.

5|$|As it is {{constructed}} using tensors, general relativity exhibits general covariance: its laws—and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework—take {{on the same}} form in all coordinate systems. Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is background independent. It thus satisfies a more stringent general principle of relativity, namely that the laws <b>of</b> <b>physics</b> are {{the same for all}} observers. Locally, as expressed in the equivalence principle, spacetime is Minkowskian, and the laws <b>of</b> <b>physics</b> exhibit local Lorentz invariance.|$|E
