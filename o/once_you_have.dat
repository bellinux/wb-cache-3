500|$|IGN's Charles Onyett {{scored the}} game 9/10, {{providing}} {{it with the}} [...] "Editors' Choice Award". He described it as [...] "hard to put down <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> started", and appreciated the game for its episodic structure, [...] "interesting" [...] story-telling mechanic, lighting effects, soundtrack and combat system, which he described as [...] "fast and responsive", but criticised the writing as [...] "uneven". The game received high marks for its [...] "strong atmosphere", [...] "fun gameplay", and [...] "great visuals", but lost some due to its [...] "weak ending".|$|E
500|$|On {{the plus}} side, the C5's {{handling}} characteristics were praised by reviewers. The Guardian called it [...] "very easy to master <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{become familiar with}} the under-thigh handlebar steering and the semi-recumbent driving position with feet on bicycle-type pedals." [...] The Daily Mirror described the arrangement as [...] "surprisingly easy" [...] to master, although it cautioned that [...] "on full speed and on full lock it's very easy to tip it onto two wheels." [...] The Daily Express motoring correspondent wrote that he found the C5 [...] "stable, comfortable and easy to handle".|$|E
500|$|On 8 June 2008, {{news reports}} {{indicated}} that Pratchett had an experience {{which he described}} as: [...] "It is just possible that <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got past all the gods that we have created with big beards and many human traits, just beyond all that, {{on the other side}} of physics, there just may be the ordered structure from which everything flows" [...] and [...] "I don't actually believe in anyone who could have put that in my head". He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father. An engram, or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from." ...|$|E

500|$|The Word for World is Forest {{shares the}} theme of dreaming with the later Le Guin novel The Lathe of Heaven. Suzanne Reid stated that the novel {{examines}} the source and effect of dreams. The Athsheans teach themselves to consciously and actively control their dreams. This allows them to access their subconscious {{in a way that}} the Terrans are not able. The Athsheans follow a polycyclic sleep pattern with a period of 120 minutes, which makes it impossible for them to adapt to the Terran eight-hour work day. Their dreaming is not restricted to times when they are asleep, with adept dreamers being able to dream while wide awake as well. [...] The visions they see while dreaming direct and shape their waking behavior, which Selver describes as [...] "balanc your sanity... on the double support, the fine balance, of reason and dream; <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> learned that, you cannot unlearn it any more than you can unlearn to think." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's title {{refers to}} the biblical story of Jacob's Ladder, or {{the dream of a}} meeting place between Heaven and Earth (Genesis 28:12). Its little-known {{alternate}} title is Dante's Inferno, in a reference to Inferno by Dante Alighieri. Screenwriter and co-producer Bruce Joel Rubin perceived the film as a modern interpretation of the Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State, the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Rubin said: [...] "The inspiration in a sense is my entire spiritual upbringing. <b>Once</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a meditative life you start to see that the world is really far different than what it appears to be. What appears to be finite is really couched in the infinite, and the infinite imbues everything in our lives." [...] Before writing his scripts for Jacob's Ladder and Ghost, which too was released in 1990, the Jewish-born Rubin spent two years in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Nepal; previously, he has also written afterlife-themed Brainstorm and Deadly Friend. His original screenplay for Jacob's Ladder differs significantly at parts from the final film, especially towards the ending.|$|E

2500|$|According to the United States Dressage Federation, [...] "Anyone can {{volunteer}} at a schooling show to scribe. Schooling shows are not recognized as official shows but {{are a great}} way to practice riding tests or to learn to scribe for a judge. <b>Once</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> scribed at a schooling show and at the lower levels, you may ask to scribe at a recognized show and perhaps even the FEI levels of competition." [...] Scribing or pencilling is also an integral part of a judge's training as they look to become accredited or upgrade to a higher level.|$|E
2500|$|In September, Chicane {{produced}} a remix {{of the classic}} track [...] "Relax (Don't Do It)" [...] by Frankie Goes To Hollywood, {{which is part of}} the 25-year anniversary of the seminal track. It was learned that the Re-Work EP was cancelled although no official announcement was ever made in regards to this. Other 'reworked' tracks that were due to appear on the EP were never mentioned from the initial announcement. Recently stated from Chicane Management; there were actually quite a few that people never got to hear. In a June 2010 interview with Impact Magazine, Bracegirdle commented on the 'Re-work Ep' issue. [...] "We covered House Arrest and there's a massive bag of legal problems with that record. God knows why. Poppiholla became this complete and utter monster... The best laid plans of mice and men can go completely astray <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a big record. Things change all the time... the plan was to (release Re-worked) and then the whole thing went completely mental... in a good way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Easwaran's Mantram Handbook {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} the practice of repeating mantrams and/or holy names, terms the author uses interchangeably. The book offers the author's practical guidance for choosing a mantram and using it for personal centering and spiritual growth. In the opening chapters, the author recommends selecting a single mantram (such as those in the table at right), and suggests that the reader [...] "take your time choosing a mantram..... then, <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> chosen a mantram, do not change it." [...] Most of the remainder of the book discusses how to integrate the mantram into daily living to improve skills and solve various types of problems. Late in the book, Easwaran describes how the mantram can be combined with other spiritual practices, such as meditation. Easwaran's approach is distinctive, in that he recommends a method of sitting meditation that does not focus on the mantram. Accordingly, the entire concern of the Mantram Handbook is in how to use a mantram throughout the day, at times apart from sitting meditation.|$|E

2500|$|Ethnic bias {{is often}} not alien to these criticisms. A good number of flamenco critics and public were {{introduced}} into flamenco {{at the time of}} the [...] "reappraisal period" [...] led by singers like Antonio Mairena and critics like González Climent or Ricardo Molina, in whose views, pure flamenco singing would be a patrimony of Romanis, which non-Romanis could only try to imitate in vain without ever reaching its essence. In the same review quoted above we can read: [...] "And <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> experienced truly great Romani singing of this sort, the erudition of an artist like Morente pales like a candle flame next to a blazing torch." [...] These views on Morente, though very common in the 1970s and 1980s, have almost died down. The controversy between tradition and innovation, Romani and non-Romani singing and other topics, so common twenty years ago, is now relatively confined to a limited section of the public, while most flamenco fans and critics acknowledge Morente's deep artistic intelligence and commitment: ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Unesco Courier, anthropologist and social theorist Mark Anspach (editor of the René Girard issue of Les Cahiers de l'Herne) explains that Aglietta and Orléan (who were very critical of economic rationality) see the classical theory of economics as a myth. According to Anspach, the vicious circle of violence and vengeance generated by mimetic rivalry gives rise to the gift economy, as a means to overcome it and achieve a peaceful reciprocity: [...] "Instead of waiting for your neighbour to come steal your yams, you offer them to him today, and it is up to him {{to do the same for}} you tomorrow. <b>Once</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made a gift, he is obliged to make a return gift. Now you have set in motion a positive circularity." [...] Since the gift may be so large as to be humiliating, a second stage of development—"economic rationality"—is required: this liberates the seller and the buyer of any other obligations than to give money. Thus reciprocal violence is eliminated by the sacrifice, obligations of vengeance by the gift, and finally the possibly dangerous gift by [...] "economic rationality." [...] This rationality, however, creates new victims, as globalization is increasingly revealing.|$|E
2500|$|The love {{triangle}} of Sharon, Nick and Phyllis garnered attention {{and was considered}} one of the genre's most titillating storylines. Soap Opera Digest named it the [...] "Best Love Triangle". Jamaica Gleaner was enthralled by the twists and turns of the love triangle and published an interview with Michelle Stafford; the newspaper asked whether Nick would end his ten-year marriage to Sharon and rather enter into an official romance with her pregnant character Phyllis. Stafford replied, [...] "In a perfect world, she'd wish [...] Nick's. But he's married; he's not going to leave Sharon. And she doesn't want him to." [...] The triangle was also a topic of debate during its run. Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide labeled the week Phyllis discovered she was expecting as a [...] "can't-miss week" [...] for the popular triangle. Aubrey Hammack, a writer for AuthorsDen, analysed the storyline and published an article on the matter of adultery. He cited the storyline as realistic, [...] "Men are notorious for saying; I can separate my sexual side from my emotions. [...] Well, unless you are a person without a conscience, this is impossible. [...] Most men just don’t realize that <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> sex with someone, that the emotions kick in not to mention the feelings of being in love and caring about that someone you are having the affair with. [...] When this happens, things spin wildly out of control." [...] With Phyllis and Nick gaining a fan following, On-Air On-Soaps referred to this as the [...] "Phick vs. Shick" [...] fan-base war.|$|E
