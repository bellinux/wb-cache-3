40|$|BackgroundHes 6 is a {{transcriptional}} regulator that induces {{transcriptional activation}} by binding to transcription repressor Hes 1 and suppressing its activity. Hes 6 {{is controlled by}} the ubiquitin-proteosome-mediated degradation system. Here we investigated the sumoylation <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6 and its functional role in its rhythmic expression. MethodsHes 6, SUMO, and ubiquitin were transfected into HeLa cells and the expression pattern was observed by Western blot and immunoprecipitation. To confirm the effect of sumoylation on the rhythmic expression <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6, we generated mouse Hes 6 promoter-driven GFP-Hes 6 fusion constructs and expressed these constructs in NIH 3 T 3 cells. ResultsOverexpression of SUMO led to sumoylation <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6 at both lysine 27 and 30. Protein stability <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6 was decreased by sumoylation. Moreover, expression <b>of</b> a <b>Hes</b> 6 sumoylation-defective mutant, the 2 KR (K 27 / 30 R) mutant, or co-expression of SUMO protease SUSP 1 with native Hes 6, strongly reduced ubiquitination. In addition, sumoylation was associated with both the rhythmic expression and transcriptional regulation <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6. Wild type Hes 6 showed oscillatory expression with about 2 -hour periodicity, whereas the 2 KR mutant displayed a longer period. Furthermore, sumoylation <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6 derepressed Hes 1 -induced transcriptional repression. ConclusionHes 6 sumoylation {{plays an important role in}} the regulation of its stability and Hes 1 -mediated transcription. These results suggest that sumoylation may be crucial for rhythmic expression <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6 and downstream target genes...|$|R
40|$|Hes 1 is a {{mammalian}} basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional repressor that inhibits {{neuronal differentiation}} and acts {{together with the}} corepressor Gro/TLE. Hes 1 interacts with Gro/TLE through its WRPW motif and recruits Gro/TLE to specific DNA sites. In contrast, a related Hes family member, Hes 6, promotes neuronal differentiation. Little {{is known about the}} molecular mechanisms underlying the neurogenic effect <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6. To address this question, a structure/function analysis was performed to identify domains <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6 important for its biological activity during the differentiation of cortical neurons. It is shown here that the nuclear translocation <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6 is required to promote cortical neurogenesis. However, Hes 6 neurogenic activity {{does not appear to be}} DNA-binding dependent, suggesting that it is mediated by protein-protein interaction mechanisms. Moreover, a conserved potential PEST sequence present at the C-terminus <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6, which may regulate protein turnover, is also important for the neurogenic activity <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6. It is also shown that the nuclear translocation-incompetent form <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6 and, to a lesser extent, the PEST sequence-defective form have a reduced ability to promote a proteolytic degradation <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 1. This correlation suggests that Hes 6 may regulate cortical neurogenesis by a protein-protein interaction mechanism in which Hes 6 interacts with Hes 1 and promotes a proteolytic degradation of the latter...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: In {{this work}} we {{examined}} {{the presence of the}} neural stem cell biomarker Hairy and Enhancer <b>of</b> Split 3 (<b>Hes</b> 3) in the anterior eye segment and in the aberrant growth condition of the conjunctiva pterygium. Further, we studied the response <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 3 to irradiation. Materials and methods: Adult mouse and human corneoscleral junction and conjunctiva, as well as human pterygium were prepared for immunohistochemical detection <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 3 and other markers. Total body irradiation was used to study the changes in the pattern <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 3 expression. Results: The adult rodent and human eye as well as pterygium, contain a population <b>of</b> cells expressing <b>Hes</b> 3. In the human eye, Hes 3 -expressing (Hes 3 +) cells are found predominantly in the subconjunctival space spanning over the limbus where they physically associate with blood vessels. The cytoarchitecture <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 3 + cells is similar to those previously observed in the adult central nervous system. Furthermore, irradiation reduces the number <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 3 + cells in the subconjunctival space. In contrast, irradiation strongly promotes the nuclear localization <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 3 in the ciliary body epithelium. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a recently identified signal transduction pathway that regulates neural stem cells and glioblastoma cancer stem cells also operates in the ocular surface, ciliary body, and in pterygium...|$|R
40|$|Hes 1 is a {{mammalian}} basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional repressor that inhibits {{neuronal differentiation}} together with corepressors of the Groucho (Gro) /Transducin-like Enhancer of split (TLE) family. The interaction <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 1 with Gro/TLE is mediated by a WRPW tetrapeptide {{present in all}} Hairy/Enhancer <b>of</b> split (<b>Hes)</b> family members. In contrast to Hes 1, the related protein Hes 6 promotes neuronal differentiation. Little {{is known about the}} molecular mechanisms that underlie the neurogenic activity <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6. It is shown here that Hes 6 antagonizes Hes 1 function by two mechanisms. Hes 6 inhibits the interaction <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 1 with its transcriptional corepressor Gro/TLE. Moreover, it promotes proteolytic degradation <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 1. This effect is maximal when both Hes 1 and Hes 6 contain the WRPW motif and is reduced when Hes 6 is mutated to eliminate a conserved site (Ser 183) that can be phosphorylated by protein kinase CK 2. Consistent with these findings, Hes 6 inhibits Hes 1 -mediated transcriptional repression in cortical neural progenitor cells and promotes the differentiation of cortical neurons, a process that is normally inhibited by <b>Hes</b> 1. Mutation <b>of</b> Ser 183 impairs the neurogenic ability <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6.

40|$|Hes 1 and Hes 6 {{are basic}} helix loop helix (bHLH) {{proteins}} {{with a similar}} structure, but opposite biological roles: Hes 1 prevents the differentiation of neural progenitors into neurons, whereas Hes 6 promotes neuronal differentiation. To elucidate {{the reasons for the}} different activities <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 1 and Hes 6, we have focused on structural elements that are specific to either Hes 1 or Hes 6. In particular, Hes 6 contains a stretch of acidic amino acids ("acidic patch") N-terminal to the bHLH domain. Such an acidic patch is not present in Hes 1. Based on previous studies showing that similar acidic patches play a role in regulating the dimerization properties of other bHLH proteins, we hypothesized that the presence of acidic amino acids, N-terminal to the bHLH domain might modulate the activities <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6 and Hes 1. As {{part of an effort to}} test this possibility, we generated a mutated form <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 1 containing an acidic patch in a position equivalent to that <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 6 (Hes 1 AC mutant). Here we show that the introduction of this acidic region does not interfere with the expression, nuclear localization, and transcription repression activity <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 1. However, this mutation has an effect on the dimerization ability <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> 1. In particular, Hes 1 AC homodimerizes better and also heterodimerizes better with Hes 6 than wild type Hes 1. Together, these results suggest that the presence of an acidic region near the bHLH motif may affect the dimerization <b>of</b> <b>Hes</b> proteins...|$|R

He and Beryl {{travelled}} over on a rough crossing to Arromanches giving a series of impromptu concerts to troops in improvised conditions, including on the backs of farm carts and army lorries, or in bomb-cratered fields. In one location the German front line was too close for him to perform, so he crawled into the trenches and told jokes with the troops there. He then boarded HMS Ambitious for his first scheduled concert before returning to France to continue his tour. During dinner with General Bernard Montgomery, whom he had met in North Africa, Formby was invited to visit the glider crews of 6th Airborne Division, who had been holding a series of bridges without relief for 56 days. He did so on 17 August in a one-day visit to the front line bridges, where he gave nine shows, all standing beside a sandbag wall, ready to jump into a slit trench in case of problems; much of the time his audience were in foxholes. After the four-week tour of France, Formby returned home to start work on I Didn't Do It (released in 1945), although he continued to work on ENSA concerts and tours in Britain.
