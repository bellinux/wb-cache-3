40|$|The Use of Schemata in Reading Comprehension: A Case of Learners’ Reading Problems. Schemata have an {{important}} role in the process of reading. It is almost impossible for a person to read without utilizing schemata. This study aimed to find learners’ reading problem in terms of using sche­mata.   A group of second year students of English Department of State University of Malang were in­volved in this study. As a case study, an interview, observation, and test were used to collect the data. The study reveals that the main reading problems were lack of background knowledge, over-reliance on background knowledge, and lack of background knowledge activation. In the process of reading, learn­ers’ background knowledge should be activated. Without optimal activation, the process of reading does not reach satisfactory results. It is also suggested that learners should not be <b>over</b> <b>confident</b> in get­ting the meaning from the text. Over-reliance on background knowledge might lead to misinterpretation...|$|R
40|$|Gender {{differences}} in voting patterns and political attitudes towards redistribution are well-documented. The experimental gender literature suggests several plausible behavioral explanations behind these differences, relating to gender {{differences in}} confidence concerning future relative income position, risk aversion, and social preferences. We use data from lab experiments on preferences for redistribution conducted in the U. S. and several European countries to disentangle these potential mechanisms. We find that when choosing to redistribute income as a disinterested observer, women choose higher tax rates than men when initial income depends on performance in a task but not when it is randomly allocated. In a veil of ignorance condition with uncertainty about the income position of the decision maker, this effect is even stronger, leading to a 10 ppt gender difference in average chosen tax rates in the performance conditions. We find that this gender difference is mainly due to men being more (<b>over)</b> <b>confident</b> about their task performance and the resulting income position, with {{gender differences in}} risk aversion and social preferences playing a minor role...|$|R

Timurtash temporarily annexed the territory around Eğridir but Mahmut kept his possessions.

Asquith immediately sent the letter to Haig, who rejected most of Wedgewood's findings laying the blame on the ineffectual fighting quality and lack of courage of the Territorial troops and on Stuart-Wortley, their commander. Haig's evidence came from a gas officer who alleged that when the gas was released [...] "for nearly an hour ... there was no hostile fire in the ground ... Yet the Territorials in question only advanced to our old trench line and held!", and that [...] "the attack was made by officers and NCO's, but few rank and file followed them."

40|$|A {{significant}} issue associated Flood Defence Systems (FDS) is {{the difficulty}} of predicting how these structures will behave when inevitably they have been loaded beyond their designed capacity by a flood. The flood can cause these structures to fail catastrophically with loss of life and substantial damage to property. For a limited incremental investment, by including resilient features shown in this document, the FDS can dramatically lessen the chances for loss of life and property damage. While not a building code, the following provides guidance {{on how to improve}} the resilience of FDS so they will not fail catastrophically when overloaded beyond their designed capacity. Of all "lessons learnt" most important is to explicitly incorporate the consequences of failure and the possibility of being wrong in one's assumptions into the design process. Building in the flood plain will always have risk; the public should not become <b>over</b> <b>confident</b> just because a FDS is place.

40|$|Human {{movement}} containing deception {{about the}} true outcome {{is thought to}} be perceived differently compared to the non-deceptive version. Exaggeration in the movement is thought to change the perceiver's mode of functioning from an invariant to a cue-based mode. We tested these ideas by examining anticipation in skilled and less skilled soccer players while they viewed temporally occluded (− 240 ms, − 160 ms, − 80 ms, 0 ms, + 80 ms) deceptive, non-deceptive, and non-deceptive-exaggerated penalty kicks. Kinematic analyses were used to ascertain that the kicking actions differed across conditions. The accuracy of judging the direction of an opponent's kick as well as response confidence were recorded. Players were <b>over</b> <b>confident</b> when anticipating deceptive penalty kicks compared to non-deceptive kicks, suggesting a cue-based mode was used. Furthermore, there was a significant relationship between less skilled players’ confidence ratings and their accuracy 80 ms before ball-foot contact in the deceptive and non-deceptive-exaggerated conditions, but not the non-deceptive condition. Because both deceptive and non-deceptive-exaggerated kicks contained exaggeration, results suggest exaggerated movements in the kickers’ action at 80 ms before ball-foot contact explains why a cue-based mode prevails when anticipating deceptive kicks at this time poin...|$|R

Our parents did not understand us, and we struggle to understand why our children would prefer to spend hours on interactive video games instead of kicking a football in the park. Our world is very different today from the world of our parents, grandparents and their parents, so it stands to reason that generations will adapt to a different world as well as influence the progress of the world.

In this paper a summer of convection permitting ensemble forecasts are analysed {{to better understand the}} factors inﬂuencing location-dependent spatial agreement of precipitation ﬁelds and the spatial spread-skill relationship over the UK. The aim is to further investigate the agreement scale method, and to highlight the information that could be extracted for a more long-term routine model evaluation. Overall, for summer 2013, the UK 2. 2 km-resolution ensemble system was found to be reasonably well spread spatially, although there was a tendency for the ensemble to be <b>over</b> <b>conﬁdent</b> in the location of precipitation. For the forecast lead times considered (up to 36 hrs) a diurnal cycle was seen in the spatial agreement and in the spatial spread-skill relationship: the forecast spread and error did not increase noticeably with forecast lead time. Both the spatial agreement, and the spatial spread-skill, were dependent on the fractional coverage and average intensity of precipitation. A poor spread-skill relationship was associated with a low fractional coverage of rain and low average rain rates. The times with a smaller fractional coverage, or lower intensity, of precipitation were found to have lower spatial agreement. The spatial agreement was found to be location dependant, with higher conﬁdence in the location of precipitation to the northwest of the UK...|$|R
40|$|The thesis writer {{would like}} to analyze a semi-autobiographical novel, {{entitled}} Totto-Chan: the Little Girl at the Window by Tetsuko Kuroyanagi. Totto-Chan suffers from Oppositional Defiant Disorder. The study is about why she suffers from the disorder, and how she recovers from it. The purposes are {{to find out the}} reasons why she suffers from the disorder, and the ways she recovers from it. To analyze this novel, the thesis writer uses Psychoanalysis of Erickson?s theory of Psychosocial Development. Totto-Chan suffers from the disorder because she has failed in the three stages of her early life. The first failure is the <b>over</b> <b>confident</b> of Totto-Chan because of Daddy and Mother?s wrong responses. The second is the over developing sense of independence by Totto-Chan because of Mother and Daddy?s little control. The last is Totto-Chan?s initiative in doing disruptive behaviors. Nevertheless, Totto-Chan is able to recover from the disorder through three therapies. The therapies are Play therapy, Individual therapy and Family therapy. As a conclusion, the keys to handle a child with this disorder are by creating and developing good communication between the child and the close people around the child. Therefore, parents should know that to raise a child in improper ways may lead to several psychological problems toward the child in his or her future life...|$|R

To augment this they sent envoys to Berengar, which promised that they will renounce to all of their plunders, and asked only their safe return to their homeland, but the <b>over</b> <b>confident</b> Berengar and his commanders refused this, believing that it will be an easy task to make them all prisoners. Although the chronicler Liutprand believes that the Hungarians were frightened, hopeless, and just wanted to escape alive, but the modern historians realized that this was only a clever role playing in order to induce the Italians in the mood, which eased their future defeat. The role playing of the Hungarian army was almost exposed when the Italian vanguard reached the Hungarian rearguard at the [...] "wide fields" [...] of Verona and forced it to fight, and the Magyars were forced to defeat the Italians, in order to escape, although probably it was not among the commanders' plans to expose their strength before the final battle. But when Berengar's main forces arrived, the Hungarian rearguard ran away, continuing its retreat. But Berengar did not took this sign too serious, and continued to chase the fleeing Hungarians.|$|R

The next day, Saint Valentine's Day, Foote's gunboats arrived and began bombarding the fort, but were driven back by the heavy guns at the fort. Foote himself was wounded. At that point the battle was proving victorious for the Confederates, but soon Union reinforcements arrived, giving Grant a total force of over 40,000 men. When Foote regained control of the river, Grant resumed his attack, but a standoff still remained. That evening Confederate commander Floyd called a council of war, unsure of his next course of action. Unable to travel due to his wounds, Foote sent Grant a dispatch requesting that they meet. Grant mounted a horse and rode seven miles over freezing roads and trenches, first reaching Smith's division, instructing him to prepare for the next assault.

For this purpose, a survey research design was planned with the Spanish young drivers (age between 18 and 24 years; no more than 4 years driving experience) as target population. From the initial near 1300 people sample invited to participate, we finally obtained complete data from 321 subjects. Measurement was based on participants self-report of interests about contents to improve their driving, self-report of their risky driving behaviour, and self¿assessment about their likelihood of being involved in a risky driving situation. Two main results arose from our data analysis: (1) novice drivers showed as their main interest to improve competences related to recognize their strengths and weaknesses as drivers (i. e., self-assessment skills); (2) a significant relationship between novice drivers interests and their current risky driving self-assessment skills was found, more especifically, general interest about post-license training was higher for the under confident self-assessors than for the <b>over</b> <b>confident</b> ones. These results provide a relevant input {{to be taken into account}} in the design of driver training programs for novice drivers; moreover, the relationship between their training interests and their current risky driving self-assessment skills introduces an additional factor to be considered in the implementation of these training program...|$|R
