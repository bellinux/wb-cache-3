This is the first report in the literature that shows the relationship between the aqueous <b>annatto</b> <b>extract</b> and its influence on lipid profile in animals. Male Fisher rats were divided into three groups (n= 12) : C group, fed standard diet and water; H group, fed high-lipid diet and water and; HU group, with high-lipid diet and aqueous <b>annatto</b> <b>extract</b> for 60 days. The treatment with <b>annatto</b> <b>extract</b> in animals fed with the high-lipid diet lowered the LDL- and total cholesterol and raised the HDL-cholesterol, suggesting a hypocholesterolemic effect. Neither highfat diet nor aqueous <b>annatto</b> <b>extract</b> had any significant effect on serum levels of albumin or serum activities of transaminases which suggested that no liver injury was induced...|$|R

The present study aimed to investigate the antiplatelet and antithrombotic activities of <b>oil</b> <b>extracted</b> from Mauritia flexuosa. The fatty acid contents were determined by gas chromatography—mass spectrometry. <b>Oil</b> <b>extract</b> of peel of Mauritia flexuosa was extracted by soxhlet extraction. The <b>oil</b> <b>extract</b> inhibited platelet secretion and aggregation induced by ADP, collagen, and TRAP- 6 by a concentration-dependent way (0. 1 to 1 [*]mg/mL) without the participation of the adenylyl cyclase pathway and diminished platelet rolling and firm adhesion under flow conditions. Furthermore, the <b>oil</b> <b>extract</b> induced a marked increase in the rolling speed of leukocytes retained on the platelet surface, reflecting a reduction of rolling and less adhesion. At the concentrations used, the <b>oil</b> <b>extract</b> significantly decreased platelet release of sP-selectin, an atherosclerotic-related inflammatory mediator. <b>Oil</b> <b>extract</b> inhibited thrombus growth at the same concentration as that of aspirin, a classical reference drug. Finally, the data presented herein also demonstrate for the first time to our knowledge the protective effect of <b>oil</b> <b>extracted</b> from Mauritia flexuosa on platelet activation and thrombosis formation...|$|R
40|$|Wound {{healing is}} a very complex process. Free {{radicals}} are generated at the site of injury, which are known to impair the healing process. The use of antioxidants has been shown to promote wound healing. Sesamin and sesamolin are the oil-soluble lignans in the sesame <b>oil</b> <b>extract</b> and proved to have antioxidant activity. In the present study, we have examined the characteristics of sesame <b>oil</b> <b>extract</b> in healing dermal wounds in rats. Male Wistar rats divided in 5 groups of 10 animals each and anesthesia was administered by an intramuscular injection of xylazine and ketamine. The right side skin of the rats was shaved and an incision of 4 cm on the shaved skin was made. Group I-IV was treated with 0. 2 sesame <b>oil</b> <b>extract,</b> 0. 13 sesame <b>oil</b> <b>extract,</b> 0. 1 sesame <b>oil</b> <b>extract</b> and standard treatment (Gentamycin ointment (1)). Group V was treated with olive oil. The rats were treated with the extract and ointment once a daily until epithelialization and complete wound closure was recorded. A better healing pattern was observed in rats treated with 0. 2 sesame <b>oil</b> <b>extract,</b> 0. 13 sesame <b>oil</b> <b>extract</b> and 0. 1 sesame <b>oil</b> <b>extract</b> compared with the control group (olive oil). There was a significant reduction in wound length and the closure rate was much faster in sesamin extract groups when compared with control groups. The epithalialization period of the groups I-IV was much shorter than the group V (control). From the results obtained, it may be concluded that Sesame <b>oil</b> <b>extract</b> {{has the potential to be}} developed into new therapeutic agent for wound healing.

The cell viability was assessed using trypan blue dye exclusion method and 3 -(4, 5 - Dimethyl thiazol- 2 yl) - 2, 5 -dimethyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The IC 50 value of the methanolic seed <b>oil</b> <b>extract</b> against MCF- 7 and HeLa was found to be 6 mg/ml and 6 mg/ml respectively after 48 hours of incubation. The P. glabra seed <b>oil</b> <b>extract</b> increased the proportion of DNA fragmentation in MCF- 7 and HeLa cancer cell lines. Moreover, the inhibitory effect is correlated with DNA fragmentation.

MethodsA total of 70 male CD- 1 Swiss albino mice were divided into 7 groups. Group I: healthy control. Group II: garlic oil group orally administrating 100  mg garlic oil extract/kg b. wt. 3  d a week for 6  weeks. Group III: infected with S.  mansoni cercariae and left untreated for 42  d. Group IV: treated with garlic <b>oil</b> <b>extract</b> from day 1 to day 7 post infection (PI). Group V: treated with garlic <b>oil</b> <b>extract</b> from day 14 till day 21 PI. Group VI: administrating garlic <b>oil</b> <b>extract</b> from day 35 until day 42 PI. Group VII received <b>oil</b> <b>extract</b> from the first day of infection for 42  d. ResultsGarlic <b>oil</b> <b>extract</b> showed changes in the parasite tegument with a significant decrease in worm burden, hepatic and intestinal ova count with a decline in granuloma number and diameter. These alterations were accompanied with a reduction in serum TNF α, ICAM- 1, IgG and IgM after 7 and 42  d post S.  mansoni cercarial infection.

40|$|<b>Oils</b> <b>extracted</b> {{from the}} leaves of Eupatorium adenophorum were tested in vitro and in vivo against the soilborne {{pathogen}} Pythium myriotylum which causes soft rot, a devastating disease of commercial ginger production in China. Twelve compounds accounting for 99. 15 % of the total oil composition were identified by GC-MS. The major components were 10 Hβ- 9 -oxo-agerophorone (37. 03 %), 10 Hα- 9 -oxo-agerophorone (37. 73 %) and 9 -oxo- 10, 11 -dehydro-agerophorone (23. 41 %). Antifungal activity was tested by the poisoned food technique against P. myriotylum, indicating minimum inhibitory concentrations of 100 μg/ml after 7 days incubation. In addition, the <b>oil</b> <b>extracts</b> greatly inhibited the formation of both wet and dry mycelial biomass. The combination of E. adenophorum <b>oil</b> <b>extracts</b> and synthetic fungicides showed a strong synergistic effect, inhibiting the mycelial growth in in vitro assays. The synergistic effect of <b>oil</b> <b>extracts</b> with fungicides could allow fungicides to be used at reduced rates in the future which has environmental advantages. <b>Oil</b> <b>extracts</b> applied at 160 and 200 μg/ml concentrations to ginger rhizomes before inoculation with P. myriotylum significantly reduced the infection rate in ginger. Examination by light and transmission electron microscopy revealed that <b>oil</b> <b>extracts</b> caused swelling of the hyphae, disruption of the cell wall, degradation of the cytoplasmic organelles and shortening of the cytoplasmic inclusion. These results suggested that the plasma membrane and endomembrane systems of P. myriotylum were severely damaged by the <b>oil</b> <b>extracts</b> of E. adenophorum which offer significant potential {{for use as a}} fungicide to control P. myriotylum...|$|R

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of Mentha piperita, Origanum majorana, Citrus lemon, Cinnamomum verum and Myristica fragrans essential volatile <b>oil</b> <b>extracts</b> on human macrophages infected by B. abortus 544. Methods: Essential volatile <b>oil</b> <b>extracts</b> from M. piperita, O. majorana, C. lemon, C. verum and M. fragrans were extracted. Human macrophages were cultured at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well in sterile 96 -well microtiter plates, and infected with B. abortus 544 at a ratio of 1 : 100 bacteria/cell. Then essential volatile <b>oil</b> <b>extracts</b> were added at a concentration of 1 %.

Results: Cinnamomum verum volatile oil at a concentration of 1 % had the highest antibacterial activity against B. abortus 544 inside human macrophages.
