This process can only start after all the code elements are stored, which takes 2 seconds. However, the filter is so economic in energy that this micro-power system is endowed with a broad prospect in remote-control application, where the demand for synchronicity is not high.

40|$|The {{crises of}} {{resource}} shortage have prompted <b>ocean</b> <b>exploitation</b> to spring {{up all over}} the world. Some crucial frictional components of marine equipment have to be directly faced with the conjoint action of wear and corrosion. Transition metal nitrides or carbides hard coatings have been widely used to improve tribological performance in various applications. However, the poor toughness, wear and corrosion resistance of coatings cannot meet the harsher marine environment, which needs to obtain multi-functional hard coatings providing complex properties. The nanocomposite structure coatings containing nanocrystalline phase embedded in an amorphous matrix allow tailoring their properties to desired value by designing chemical composition and nanostructure. In this work, V-Al-C and V-Al-C-N coatings were deposited on silicon and high speed steel (HSS) substrates by magnetron sputtering. The crystal microstructure, chemical composition, surface morphology, cross-sectional structure, mechanical property and friction behavior of the coatings under different contact conditions (air, distilled water and artificial seawater) were studied by XRD, XPS, SEM, nano-indentation and ball-on-disc tribometer. The results showed that the V-Al-C coating displayed columnar structure with coarse grain. When the nitrogen was incorporated, the coating structure evolved into nanocomposite structure composed of nanocrystallite and amorphous carbon. The hardness increased from (14 +/- 0. 48) GPa to (24. 5 +/- 0. 8) GPa, and the toughness was significantly improved (H/E> 0. 1). In air condition, the friction coefficient decreased from 0. 70 to 0. 42, owing to the synergy interaction between V 2 O 5 and amorphous carbon during sliding. The friction coefficients of the both coatings in distilled water and artificial seawater were lower than those in air owing to the boundary lubrication forming lubricative film by absorbed water. The friction coefficient in seawater was lower than those in distilled water, resulting from the formation of Mg(OH) (2) and CaCO 3 during sliding. However, the wear rates of the both coatings in artificial seawater were larger than that in distilled water, which demonstrated a synergism between corrosion and wear in artificial water. The V-Al-C coating was all worn out under different contact conditions owing to severe abrasive wear, while the V-Al-C-N coating showed better wear resistance, with a wear rate of 3. 0 x 10 (- 16) m(3) /(N center dot m) in air and 1. 4 x 10 (- 15) m(3) /(N center dot m) in artificial water, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{contemporary}} determinators of Australia’s {{naval force}} structure are generally derived from threat based calculations as modelled through scenario focused exercises. Analysis, future capability development, and force structure planning, are principally configured for high-intensity war-fighting roles against a similarly sophisticated enemy, in the defence of the Australian mainland—in {{the belief that}} forces structured for the defence of Australia and its approaches can meet all the tasks asked of it by the Government. The underlying assumption is that geostrategic imperatives should shape strategy as well as force structure. The focus remains firmly affixed to ‘contest’ and the assertion of strategic security to the determent of constabulary control. It also drives the tendencies for ‘bigger/brighter and more gigabytes’ {{that lead to the}} unsatisfiable demands in defence expenditure and the over-specification of required capability. This thesis argues that a historical trend analysis offers a further dimension in appreciating naval force structure emphasis, claiming that {{there are at least three}} contemporary pressures that should be exerting influence on a nation’s naval planning—these pressures are maritime geopolitical evolution through a dominant sea power hypothesis, the asymmetric response to technology that has changed the character of warfare, particularly at sea, and the inevitable progression of <b>ocean</b> <b>exploitation</b> and enclosure that has dawned the modern era in oceans governance. All three forces are applying their pressure in a similar direction—away from the traditional ship-of-war, towards the ship-of-law and the ship-of-expedition over the shore. To argue this thesis there are three supporting suppositions: The first supposition contends that we have entered the era of Pax Americana—an era of unchallenged maritime supremacy. Like the eras of Pax Romana and Pax Britannica before it, with Pax Americana ruling the oceans and guaranteeing the freedom of navigation, there is now an emergent need to shift the balance of force structure away from those naval forces that are needed to fight for the control of the seas—combat and contest—and towards those naval forces that are going to use the sea control given to them—regulation and utilisation. The second, that the character of warfare has changed: that conventional warfare has moved to the Third World. Yet the modern ship-of-war is at the forefront of technological development and the product of a nation’s technical ability and resource. It is designed to fight against a similarly sophisticated enemy; against a platform that resembles itself in technical sophistication. It is also a weapon of statecraft, as only States can afford the infrastructure and costs to support them. If conventional warfare has indeed moved to the Third World, then it has also moved against States that do not have the technical skills and resource base to support the modern warship—the traditional ship-of-war no longer has an equally sophisticated enemy. The third, that the modern practise of State sovereignty expansion and ocean enclosure that has dawned the modern era of ocean governance is a fundamental evolution in ocean usage. It is now being reflected in, or by, the increased awareness of, and emphasis on, ‘constabulary tasking’ such as resource management, environmental protection, immigration regulation, quarantine inspection and trans-national crime enforcement—the demand for a ship-of-law...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Twentieth century {{commercial}} whaling {{drastically reduced}} {{the abundance of}} great whale populations in the Southern <b>Ocean.</b> <b>Exploitation</b> began on the south Atlantic island of South Georgia, where catch records account for over 175, 000 whales killed. Modern whaling within the Southern Ocean depleted populations rapidly, and by 1966, hunting blue whales south of 40 °S was prohibited by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). After 40 years of protection, this species has shown little recovery. A current abundance estimate of 2, 280 (CV= 0. 036) individuals from sighting data (1991 / 92 - 2003 / 04) represents less than 1 % the original abundance. With such an intensive demographic 'bottleneck,' {{it is likely that}} genetic diversity has been lost from some or all components of the Southern Ocean population. Here I describe historical and contemporary Antarctic blue whale mtDNA diversity and report the first circumpolar analyses of contemporary population structure. In Chapter 2, historical mtDNA diversity is described from whale bones collected from the first Southern Hemisphere whaling stations established in 1904 on the island of South Georgia. A total of 281 whale bones were representative of three prominent species hunted in South Georgian waters. Using ancient DNA methods and sequencing of the mtDNA control region, bone samples were first identified to species, identifying 153 humpback, 49 fin, 18 blue, 2 sei, 1 southern right whale and 1 elephant seal. Within each of the three prominent historic species populations, mtDNA haplotypes were described resulting in 64 humpback, 34 fin, and 16 blue whale haplotypes. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity within each of the three historic species populations ranged from 0. 980 - 0. 987 and 1. 87 - 3. 16 %, respectively. In chapter 3, I update the previous estimate of contemporary Antarctic blue whale mtDNA diversity with biopsy samples of living whales collected during research cruises conducted with IWC oversight from 1990 - 2009 (n= 218) for comparison to historical blue whale mtDNA diversity. After the removal of replicate samples based on 15 microsatellite loci, the dataset described 167 individuals. This dataset was combined with additional published Antarctic blue whale mtDNA control region sequences (LeDuc et al. 2007; n= 20) to represent the most comprehensive dataset available for Antarctic blue whale mtDNA diversity (n= 187). A high haplotype diversity was described within this contemoporary population (0. 968). With this dataset, I report the first evidence of population structure within the IWC Southern Ocean management Areas I-VI through an analysis of genetic differentiation. The identification of recaptures within the dataset through microsatellite genotyping, allows for the first inference of movement of six individuals with the Southern Ocean {{since the end of the}} Discovery marking program 50 years ago. In the final chapter of this thesis, I explore the impact of the 20 th century commercial whaling industry on the Antarctic blue whale population through a comparison of historical and contemporary Antarctic blue whale mtDNA diversity. The comparison showed that only 6 of the 16 haplotypes from the South Georgian population were found in contemporary worldwide blue whale populations, indicating a potential loss of mtDNA lineages. The loss of mtDNA haplotypes sugges two hypotheses; either a low predicted loss of widespread Antarctic blue whale mtDNA diversity or the loss of a South Georgia local Antarctic blue whale population driven to commercial extinction. The impact of commercial whaling is also assessed through a prediction of the minimum number of maternal lineages, or haplotypes, to have survived the exploitation bottleneck. The number of 51 mtDNA haplotypes identified within the contemporary Antarctic blue whale population is used to update the estimate of haplotypes within the unsampled contemporary population. We predict 69 mtDNA lineages within the contemporary population from the current abundance estimate of 2, 280 (1, 160 - 4, 500) individuals (Branch 2008). This prediction will increase the lower bound of population abundance used in population dynamic modeling and may reduce an upward bias in population increase estimates used to assess the recovery of this species...|$|E

The application of U-shaped dampers in deep-sea floating platforms is difficult due to the restriction of a large horizontal length. A novel S-shaped damper is proposed to retain the same amount of liquid using a shorter S-shaped tunnel. Theoretical and experimental works are conducted and prove that an S-shaped damper needs less than half the horizontal length to provide the same suppression as a U-shaped damper.

Although main research works on hydrate have been commenced after observing blockage of gas flow lines by Hammerschmidt (1934), however, fast growth of publications implies interest of scientists in this subject (Shahnazar and Hasan 2014; Dehaghani and Badizad 2016 a; Shadman et al. 2016). On the one hand, petroleum industry has been suffered from economic and technical issues associated with hydrate formation during natural gas transmission, and on the other hand, broad advantages such as gas storage and separation show promising side of hydrates (Lucia et al. 2014; Dehaghani and Badizad 2016 b).

40|$|The {{ocean is}} {{characterized}} by a multitude of powerful, sporadic biophysical dynamical events; scientific research has reached the stage that their interpretation and prediction is now becoming possible. Ocean prediction, analogous to atmospheric weather prediction but combining biological, chemical and physical features is able to help us understand the complex coupled physics, biology and acoustics of the ocean. Applications of the prediction of the <b>ocean</b> environment include <b>exploitation</b> and management of marine resources, pollution control such as planning of maritime and naval operations. Given the vastness of ocean, it is essential for effective ocean prediction to employ adaptive sampling to best utilize the available sensor resources in order to minimize the forecast error. It is important to concentrate measurements to the regions where one can witness features of physical or biological significance in progress. Thus automated feature extraction in oceanographic visualization can facilitate adaptive sampling by presenting the physically relevant features directly to the operation planners. Moreover it could be used to help automate adaptive sampling. Vortices (eddies and gyres) and upwelling, two typical and important features of the ocean, are studied. (cont.) A variety of feature extraction methods are presented, and those more pertinent to this study are implemented, including derived field generation and attribute set extraction. Detection results are evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, clarity and usability. Vortices, a very important flow feature is the primary focus of this study. Several point-based and set-based vortex detection methods are reviewed. A set-based vortex core detection method based on geometric properties of vortices is applied to both classical vortex models and real ocean models. The direction spanning property, which is a geometric property, guides the detection of all the vortex core candidates, and the conjugate pair eigenvalue method is responsible for filtering out the false positives from the candidate set. Results show the new method to be analytically accurate and practically feasible, and superior to traditional point-based vortex detection methods. Detection methods of streamlines are also discussed. Using the novel cross method or the winding angle method, closed streamlines around vortex cores can be detected. (cont.) Therefore, the whole vortex area, i. e., the combination of vortex core and surrounding streamlines, is detected. Accuracy and feasibility are achieved through automated vortex detection requiring no human inspection. The detection of another ocean feature, upwelling, is also discussed. by Da Guo. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Intense {{harvesting}} of <b>ocean</b> resources extended <b>exploitation</b> {{activities to}} previously unexplored open ocean areas, to greater ocean depths and to remote polar regions. Such activities include, {{but are not}} limited to, energy, geology and fisheries. In practice, not only the number of working platforms at sea has increased dramatically, but their structure is more complex with multi sites, interconnecting pipes, cables, remote sensors and mobile platforms. In many cases, each exploitation site represents a complex submerged infrastructure requiring timely maintenance, protection and monitoring. An underlying requirement for efficient protection and monitoring of such infrastructures is the existence of reliable communications which, for submerged and untethered platforms, can only be done acoustically. So, underwater acoustic communications became an enabler for many ocean activities. More, with the multiplication of agents in geographically limited areas point-to-point communications quickly evolved to the necessity of communication networks. The European Union has recently published a marine strategy directive aiming at defining the concept of "good environmental status". Among others, one of the descriptors directly addresses the amount of acoustic energy in the ocean. Acoustic energy sources combine along time and range to form what is normally termed as ocean soundscape (or ambient noise). As we know, measurement and/or monitoring of ocean noise is a complex task since there are a large number of indicators {{to be taken into account}} to characterize the wide variety of noise types according to their origin, duration, intensity, frequency, directional properties, etc. It is undeniable that anthropogenic noise has increased steadily in the last decades as a result of the increase of 1) the ship traffic (in number of ships, size and speed) and 2) the number of work platforms at sea, most of which for fossil and/or renewable energy generation. The impact of this underwater sound pressure increase on marine life and biodiversity is still under assessment. Estimating the "good environmental status" in offshore activities requires a complete Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) structure with complex surveillance routines, multi parameter data recording and multi site sensing. EIA aims at monitoring the emission of pollutants, contaminants, preserving marine life and preventing environmental disasters either man made or due to natural conditions. Efficient EIA employs underwater acoustics as a means for communicating to remote nodes and to underwater mobile platforms. Whether underwater acoustic communications usage under EIA is harmful for marine life thus contributing to the deterioration of the "good environmental status" is an open question. This talk reports the underwater acoustic communications work carried out at Larsys, in collaboration with Underwater Acoustic Network (UAN) project partners in the last few years. This includes the ongoing combat to Intersymbol Interference (ISI) and signal loss by signal coherent recombination in time, frequency and, recently, in angle. The basic tool is the usage of the passive time-reversal concept. The usage of ISI-reduction techniques for mobile node communications in underwater networks was tested in a open sea full size deployment as part of the UAN project, during a sea trial that took place in the Strindfjord, Trondheim (Norway), at the end of May of 2011. Future work intends to address two topics: one is the reduction of the dependence of a vertical hydrophone array for passive time reversal processing, by exploring "compact" vector sensor arrays and the other is to investigate biological acoustic noise as a potential signal interference source for underwater acoustic communication signals and networks. 7 th Framework Program, contract 22566...|$|R
40|$|Sustainably {{managing}} marine ecosystems {{has proved}} extremely difficult, with few success stories. Traditional approaches to managing ocean-borne activities, including {{the structure of}} the governance systems themselves, have had difficulty keeping pace with the dynamics of coupled human, ecological, and oceanographic systems. In essence, our governance systems for ocean resources and environments have had difficulty keeping pace with advances in <b>ocean</b> use and <b>exploitation</b> technologies. In the United States today there are over twenty federal agencies and thirty-five coastal states and territories operating under hundreds of statutory authorities shaping coastal and ocean policy. For years, among marine ecologists and policy experts there has been consensus that a major overhaul in U. S. ocean governance is necessary. This dissertation broadly suggests the public trust doctrine [...] an ancient legal concept that is already incorporated in U. S. state coastal laws [...] could uniquely provide a critical legal foundation for a new era in U. S. federal ocean governance. Though the public trust concept can be located in the legal systems of many countries, it robustly manifests in the United States, where it has historically protected the public's rights to fishing, navigation, and commerce in and over navigable waterways and tidal waters. In its most basic form, the doctrine obliges governments to manage common natural resources, the body of the trust, {{in the best interest of}} their citizens, the beneficiaries of the trust. Today the public trust doctrine is integral to the protection of coastal ecosystems and beach access in many states and has even made its way into state constitutions. It would be simple, and seemingly logical, to assume that the same fiduciary responsibility of states to protect public trust uses of their waters extends to all marine resources within the United States' 200 -mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). However an artificial line has been drawn around state waters, and the legal authority and responsibility of the U. S. government to protect public trust resources in the vast space of its EEZ (the largest of any country on earth) have never been fully and expressly established. The second chapter in this dissertation outlines the development of states' public trust doctrines; discusses the expansion of U. S. sovereignty over its neighboring ocean waters during the twentieth century; analyzes possible avenues for expanding the doctrine to federal waters; and considers how a federal public trust doctrine could clarify some specific issues in U. S. oceans management. At the heart of this chapter's analysis lie three questions: (1) does a federal public trust doctrine exist; (2) if so, can it be rightfully extended to include the entirety of the U. S. ocean waters; and (3) could the doctrine provide the missing catalyst for federal agencies to manage the use of U. S. ocean resources in a coordinated, sustainable fashion? The third chapter asks how the public trust doctrine could inform marine spatial planning in US waters. It argues that in the absence of a statutory mandate for agencies to collaborate in their management of ocean-borne activities, the public trust doctrine could provide a framework for restructuring the way the US federal government regulates ocean uses. The forth chapter examines the blowout of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig on April 20, 2010, and surmises that regulatory capture of the Minerals Management Service aided by a balkanized ocean governance regime in the pre-Deepwater Horizon era provided a potent source of systemic risk in the U. S. offshore oil and gas industry. It discusses the factors contributing to MMS' susceptibility to capture in the pre-Deepwater Horizon era, as well as examples of decisions it made that suggest dynamics of regulatory capture were at play. The chapter then explores the reform of offshore oil and gas regulation under BOERME and the National Ocean Council to understand the how these new governmental structures might be less susceptible to capture. Lastly, the chapter considers the added value of extending two alternative versions of a clear federal public trust mandate - a foundational US natural resources doctrine - to offshore oil and gas regulation and, more generally, to coastal and marine spatial planning under the National Ocean Council. The final substantive chapter of this dissertation concerns the US Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force and reports the results of a case study analysis that I conducted to explore how and why the Task Force designed the National Ocean Policy and interagency governance structure, the National Ocean Council, like it did. I found that the recommendations of the Task Force drew heavily from previous studies of US federal ocean policy and the Committee on Ocean Policy, which lasted from 2004 - 2009. Additionally I sought to understand the Task Force within the context of other US interagency collaborative efforts and theories concerning collaborative governance. I found that the Task Force process was characterized by several characteristics that policy scholars have previously identified as important to promoting collaboration among agencies. I also found support for the theoretical proposition that often external and political factors have major impacts on the level of success attained by interagency efforts. Lastly, via interviews with Task Force staffers and content analysis of public comments submitted to the Task Force, I determined that - though not included in the National Ocean Policy - there remains interest in the principles of the public trust doctrine as underpinning for the policy, which seeks "[t]o achieve an America whose stewardship ensures that the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes are healthy and resilient, safe and productive, and understood and treasured so as to promote the well-being, prosperity, and security of present and future generations.

40|$|As of August 26, 2005, {{there were}} 149 {{parties to the}} United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (“the Convention”). States of all sorts, with the most diverse {{interests}} in the oceans, {{from all parts of}} the globe, are parties to the Convention. For all the parties to the Convention virtually all legal questions concerning the law of the sea are now governed by the Convention. Such questions are, in effect, questions of interpretation and application of the Convention. While interpretation and application of particular provisions may vary somewhat from one state to another, the scope of such differences is confined by the fact that each party is working from the same authoritative text. Also, as parties to the Convention, these states, as well as the European Union, the one international organization that is a party, have rights to participate in the bodies established by the Convention and related agreements. The U. S., however, has not signed the Convention, nor has it acceded to it, so it is not a state party. It is, therefore, not bound by the terms of the Convention and it may not participate, absent some special arrangement, in the ongoing work of Convention-related bodies. In 1994, however, the U. S. signed a subsequent, related agreement, the Agreement Relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (“the Implementation Agreement”), which was intended to cure certain defects in the Convention to allow the U. S., as well as other industrialized nations, to become parties to it. In October 2003, during the 108 th Congress (2003 - 2004), the U. S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee held hearings to examine the question of U. S. accession to the Convention and ratification of the accompanying Implementation Agreement. On February 25, 2004, the Committee voted unanimously (19 - 0) to support U. S. accession/ratification and reported the Convention and the Implementation Agreement to the full Senate for its consideration. On March 11, 2004, the Convention was placed on the Senate schedule and became eligible for the final phase that would bring the U. S. into state party membership. At the adjournment of the 108 th Congress, the Convention had not been brought to a vote. As a result the Convention has slid back in the domestic “advice and consent” process and must once again be considered by the Foreign Relations Committee before it can be submitted to the full Senate. In light of the United States’ twentythree year long desistance from ratification/accession, and particularly in light of the failure to have the Convention brought to a vote in the Senate in 2004, a number of questions merit examination. Why did the Senate refrain from voting on the Convention? Are there any credible signs that indicate U. S. ratification/accession is likely to occur soon? And, if the U. S. remains “outside the Convention” how might it protect its global ocean interests? For the first century of its existence, the U. S. used its waters and coasts in a fashion similar to other maritime states. The seas were employed as marine highways, carrying people and goods in domestic and international commerce. Fishery resources were exploited. Coastal areas were developed to facilitate water dependent industries and to spur economic expansion. In the 1890 s the U. S. embarked on an ambitious program to create a powerful “battleship navy,” capable of projecting military power not only in the Caribbean and Latin America, areas in which the U. S. had long claimed a special interest, but also throughout Asia and beyond. From that time to the present, as U. S. naval power and commercial and strategic interests abroad expanded, the U. S. has regarded those aspects of the international law of the sea that impact military uses as having overriding importance. Its principal interests in this regard were to maximize freedom of navigation for its naval vessels (and later freedom of overflight of ocean areas for its military aircraft), and, to that end, to resist encroachments on traditional freedom of the seas. In the 1890 s, also, offshore oil and gas development began off the west coast of the U. S. in the form of pier-based oil drilling. As technology rapidly developed in the 20 th century it became apparent that vast sources of economic goods and uses lay off the coasts of the U. S. This realization prompted President Truman to proclaim exclusive jurisdiction over the resources on and below the continental shelf of the U. S. in 1945. This claim served as a watershed in law of the sea doctrine in that it was based more on contours and contiguity than on existing substantive legal principles or practices. The Proclamation did, however, fit into a recognized method of international law development, i. e., the practice of claim and response. In this case, the U. S. claimed sovereignty over the continental shelf and the international community could respond in roughly one of two ways: rejection or acquiescence and adoption. The latter path was chosen and shortly after the U. S. claim was issued, maritime nations around the globe issued similar claims. While the process of claim-and-response often involves decades or centuries to fashion what becomes accepted as customary international law, the practice of so many states prompted one commentator to suggest that a customary international law principle regarding continental shelf claims may have crystallized in as few as four or five years. At about the same time, the end of the Second World War prompted the international community to seek to codify international law in a large number of areas under the auspices of the U. N. The law of the sea was selected as one of those areas. Four multilateral treaties emerged from the first United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (now known as UNCLOS I) : the Convention on the High Seas, the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, the Convention on the Continental Shelf, and the Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the High Seas. These treaties effectively split up state interests in the oceans and codified certain rules, yet they remained ambiguous in some areas and completely deficient in others. Further, none of the four conventions contained compulsory dispute resolution processes, in spite of the fact that the use of <b>ocean</b> space and <b>exploitation</b> of <b>ocean</b> resources was expanding rapidly and concomitantly, increased the likelihood of conflict. Efforts to close some of the gaps and clarify some of the ambiguities via a second U. N. Conference on the Law of the Sea failed. In November 1967, in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Malta 2 ̆ 7 s Ambassador, Arvid Pardo, called the delegates’ attention to the potential wealth that lay on the ocean seabed. He proposed that the seabed area beyond the jurisdictional boundaries of states be declared the “common heritage of mankind” and that any resources retrieved from that area ought to be shared in a fair and distributive manner. Remarkably, similar statements had been uttered by U. S. administrations over the course of the nation’s history. In the early years of the republic, John Adams noted that “the oceans and [their] treasures are the common property of all men. ” In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson declared that “[w]e must ensure that the deep seas and the ocean bottoms are, and remain, the legacy of all human beings. ” In the U. S. Congress one year later, Senator Claiborne Pell was advocating the formation of a new framework governing the use of the seabed and its resources. By 1970, the U. N. General Assembly drafted a Conference Resolution, which called for the convening of a new law of the sea conference and established a Seabed Committee, which set the stage for what would become the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III). Negotiations for a comprehensive law of the sea treaty began in 1973. In the U. S., there was bipartisan support for such a treaty. Prompted by the Stratton Commission Report in 1969, the Nixon administration undertook a thorough review of U. S. policy on the use of the oceans. In 1970, President Nixon proposed that all nations adopt as soon as possible a treaty under which they renounced all national claims to the natural resources of the seabed beyond the point where the high seas reach a depth of 200 meters and agreed to regard these resources as the common heritage of mankind...|$|R
