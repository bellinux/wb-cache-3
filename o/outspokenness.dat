5|$|LeMond is a {{longtime}} vocal opponent of performance-enhancing drug use. He first spoke on-record against doping in cycling after winning the 1989 Tour de France. LeMond received intense criticism in 2001 when he publicly expressed doubts about the legitimacy of Lance Armstrong's Tour success after learning {{of his relationship with}} Dr. Michele Ferrari. His <b>outspokenness</b> placed him {{in the center of the}} anti-doping controversy.|$|E
5|$|Around 1779 Priestley and Shelburne had a rupture, {{the precise}} reasons for which remain unclear. Shelburne blamed Priestley's health, while Priestley claimed Shelburne had no further use for him. Some contemporaries speculated that Priestley's <b>outspokenness</b> had hurt Shelburne's {{political}} career. Schofield {{argues that the}} most likely reason was Shelburne's recent marriage to Louisa Fitzpatrick—apparently, {{she did not like}} the Priestleys. Although Priestley considered moving to America, he eventually accepted Birmingham New Meeting's offer to be their minister.|$|E
5|$|Cibber's comedy Love's Last Shift (1696) is {{an early}} herald of a massive shift in {{audience}} taste, away from the intellectualism and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender-role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. According to Paul Parnell, Love's Last Shift illustrates Cibber's opportunism at {{a moment in time}} before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something for everybody into his first play, combining the old <b>outspokenness</b> with the new preachiness.|$|E
5|$|Goldman {{found it}} {{difficult}} to acclimate to the German leftist community in Berlin. Communists despised her <b>outspokenness</b> about Soviet repression; liberals derided her radicalism. While Berkman remained in Berlin helping Russian exiles, Goldman moved to London in September 1924. Upon her arrival, the novelist Rebecca West arranged a reception dinner for her, attended by philosopher Bertrand Russell, novelist H. G. Wells, and more than 200 other guests. When she spoke of her dissatisfaction with the Soviet government, the audience was shocked. Some left the gathering; others berated her for prematurely criticizing the Communist experiment. Later, in a letter, Russell declined to support her efforts at systemic change in the Soviet Union and ridiculed her anarchist idealism.|$|E
5|$|Though widely {{respected}} in her later years, Roosevelt was a controversial First Lady {{at the time}} for her <b>outspokenness,</b> particularly her stance on racial issues. She was the first presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences, write a daily newspaper column, write a monthly magazine column, host a weekly radio show, and speak at a national party convention. On a few occasions, she publicly disagreed with her husband's policies. She launched an experimental community at Arthurdale, West Virginia, {{for the families of}} unemployed miners, later widely regarded as a failure. She advocated for expanded roles for women in the workplace, the civil rights of African Americans and Asian Americans, and the rights of World War II refugees.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt was {{appointed}} Chief of the General Staff (CGS) in August 2006, succeeding General Sir Mike Jackson. Dannatt faced controversy over his <b>outspokenness,</b> in particular his calls for improved pay and conditions for soldiers {{and for a}} drawdown of operations in Iraq {{in order to better}} man those in Afghanistan. He also set about trying to increase his public profile, worried that he was not recognisable enough {{at a time when he}} had to defend the Army's reputation against alleged prisoner abuse in Iraq. He later assisted with the formation of Help for Heroes to fund a swimming pool at Headley Court and, later in his tenure, brokered an agreement with the British press that allowed Prince Harry to serve in Afghanistan. He was succeeded as CGS by Sir David Richards and retired in 2009, taking up the largely honorary post of Constable of the Tower of London, which he held until July 2016.|$|E
5|$|Elliott {{embarked}} for Australia on the RMS Orontes on 15 May 1919, {{sharing a}} cabin {{with an old}} friend, Brigadier General Gordon Bennett. They arrived back in Melbourne on 28 June, and his AIF appointment was terminated the following day. He contested the federal election {{as a candidate for}} the Nationalist Party of Australia on 13 December 1919. He achieved the greatest popular vote of any Victorian candidate for the Senate. Moreover, he repeated this success at the 1925 election. Although not naturally suited to life in the federal parliament, he made significant contributions, and was outspoken in his efforts to assist returned servicemen, particularly those with whom he had served. This <b>outspokenness</b> often took the form of arguing in the Senate in relation to the new legislation being brought before it, when such legislation involved the defence forces. At other times, he would personally champion the cause of those men who had been in his battalion.|$|E
5|$|Model's {{decision}} to burn all his personal papers {{at the end}} of World War II means relatively little is known about his early years. Born to a music teacher in Genthin, Saxony, he belonged to a lower-middle class, non-military family. Following schooling at the Bürgerschule (citizen school) in Genthin, he graduated with his Abitur from the , a humanities oriented secondary school, on Easter 1909. He entered the army officer cadet school (Kriegsschule) in Neisse (now Nysa, Poland) in 1909, where he was an unexceptional student, and was commissioned a lieutenant (Leutnant) in the 52nd Infantry Regiment von Alvensleben in 1910. He made few friends among his fellow officers and soon became known for his ambition, drive, and blunt <b>outspokenness.</b> These were characteristics that would mark his entire career.|$|E
5|$|Through 1971, it was {{uncertain}} if Agnew would be retained {{on the ticket}} as Nixon sought a second term in 1972. Neither Nixon nor his aides were enamored of Agnew's independence and <b>outspokenness,</b> and were less than happy at Agnew's popularity among conservatives suspicious of Nixon. The President considered replacing him with Treasury Secretary John Connally, a Democrat and former Governor of Texas. For his part, Agnew was unhappy with many of Nixon's stances, especially in foreign policy, disliking Nixon's rapprochement with China (on which Agnew was not consulted) and believing that the Vietnam War could be won with sufficient force. Even after Nixon announced his re-election bid {{at the start of}} 1972, it was unclear if Agnew would be his running mate, and it was not until July 21 that Nixon asked Agnew and the vice president accepted. A public announcement was made the following day.|$|E
5|$|Bernt Michael Holmboe {{was born}} in Vang in 1795, the son of vicar Jens Holmboe (17461823) and his wife Cathrine Holst (17631823). He grew up in Eidsberg with his nine siblings, and was the elder brother of noted philologist Christopher Andreas Holmboe. Holmboe was homeschooled from an early age, but {{was sent to the}} Christiania Cathedral School in 1810 to {{complete}} his secondary education. There he undertook extracurricular studies in mathematics. He enrolled as a student at the Royal Frederick University in 1814, a turbulent year in Norwegian history. Norway had been a province of Denmark since 1397, but had come under Swedish control in the January 1814 Treaty of Kiel. Following Norway's declaration of independence in the Constitution of 17 May, Sweden responded by waging a military campaign against Norway during the summer of 1814. Holmboe was a spokesperson for the student group opposed to the presence of Swedish troops in the country. Any <b>outspokenness</b> from the student community was highly visible at the time, as the university had only seventeen students as of 1813, its year of establishment.|$|E

25|$|In {{cultures}} that value <b>outspokenness</b> and overt confidence, shyness can {{be perceived as}} weakness. To an unsympathetic observer, a shy individual may be mistaken as cold, distant, arrogant or aloof, which can be frustrating for the shy individual. However, in other cultures, shy people {{may be perceived as}} being thoughtful, intelligent, as being good listeners, and as being more likely to think before they speak.|$|E

He was elevated to the peerage, as Baron Dowding of Bentley Priory on 2 June 1943.|$|E

The government of France made him a Commandeur de la Légion d'honneur.|$|E
25|$|Lucas is {{particularly}} {{well known for}} his activism and <b>outspokenness.</b> His criticism of drug use and his sponsorship of public service ad campaigns {{about the dangers of}} unprotected sex in the gay community led Harvey Fierstein to interview him for The Advocate. His New York Blade columns on Ultra-Orthodox Judaism and Islam sparked a campus debate at Stanford University in February 2008 when Lucas was invited to give a speech to students. In 2010 he debated Peter Tatchell and Sue Sanders at England's Oxford University on whether the gay rights movement has undermined family values.|$|E
25|$|Ordronaux's {{activity}} as a Commissioner was frequently {{mentioned in the}} press. In 1875, he {{was called in to}} adjudicate whether a man, who was under sentence of death for murder, was insane. The same newspaper reported again on 7 January 1876 how Ordronaux had found that Kings County Lunatic Asylum was being mismanaged by the charity commissioners (17). He also investigated complaints from two inmates in Buffalo asylum of abusive behaviour by their carers. In his report Ordronaux upheld the complaints and recommended the discharge of the two staff involved. By 1882 his forward thinking and <b>outspokenness</b> had made him some enemies and in 1882 his salary of $4000 as Commissioner in Lunacy was temporarily opposed in debate in the finance committee of the New York State Senate.|$|E
25|$|Mary Beale (née Cradock; 26 March 1633 – 1699) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} professional female Baroque era portrait painters of the late 17th century due to her perseverance of her business. Praised by Richard Gibson and court painter Peter Lely, she is considered as successful as Joan Carlile. Joan Carlile was also an English portrait painter, who {{was one of the}} first women to practise painting professionally. Mary Beale managed to be the financial provider for her family through her professional portrait business. Her book Observations, although it was never officially published, was one of the first instructional books ever written by a woman, and boldly announced her authority on painting.

His {{paternal}} grandfather, Giulio Sivori, was an immigrant from Cavi di Lavagna, a hamlet {{in the province of}} Genoa, while his mother Carolina was of Abruzzian descent. As a youngster Sívori became heavily interested in the game of football {{and by the time he}} reached his teens he was signed up to a side from the city of Buenos Aires, River Plate. The teenage Sívori was given a chance to break through into a squad which included players like the famed forwards Ángel Labruna and Félix Loustau who established themselves in the era of La Máquina, one of the foremost formations in football history. He soon earned the nickname El Cabezón (bighead) from the fans, due to his hair, <b>outspokenness,</b> confidence, arrogance, and playing style.|$|E
25|$|The Real World: Hollywood Reunion special {{was held}} live in Times Square on July 12, 2008, and was hosted by Lyndsey Rodrigues. All cast members {{appeared}} except for Greg, whose absence was not explained, but {{was the source}} of speculation.

[...] Reviewers almost unanimously commented on the <b>outspokenness</b> of Kraft's storytelling, and his readiness to personally criticize those {{with whom he had}} disagreed. Cooper noted that Kraft [...] "pull no punches about some of [...] shortcomings," [...] and Kliatt magazine said that he [...] "isn't afraid to name names." ...|$|E
500|$|His <b>outspokenness</b> {{about the}} issues facing the Armenian {{population}} annoyed not only the Ottoman authorities {{but some of the}} Armenian wealthy elite as well. According to Gerard Libaridian, the promotion of rights of provincial Armenians [...] "made him an enemy of many influential Armenians in Istanbul." [...] He was compelled to resign by the Ottoman government in 1873. Armayis Vartooguian wrote in 1896 that Khrimian [...] "could have held the post of Patriarch of Constantinople for life had he not been driven to resign by the intrigues of the Turkish Government, which disliked him very much because of his zeal for the well-being of his flock." ...|$|E
500|$|Berger's SA {{career was}} limited by his soldierly ideas of {{politics}} and leadership, but after the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933, he {{was found to be}} very suitable to lead Schutzhaft operations, which involved the rounding up of Jews and [...] "political undesirables". In April 1933, his clashes with younger leaders meant his SA career had met a dead-end. His SA peers criticised Berger's ambitious nature, <b>outspokenness</b> and lack of self-reflection. Beginning in July 1934, Berger worked with the SA training chief [...] SA-Obergruppenführer Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger. Between 1933 and 1935, he was a school inspector in Esslingen am Neckar near Stuttgart, and in 1935 was a senior official in the Gau Württemberg– Hohenzollern Ministry of Culture. He was recruited into the Allgemeine SS by Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler in 1936, on Krüger's recommendation. Initially appointed to oversee sports and physical training for SS-Oberabschnitt Südwest (SS Regional Headquarters Southwest), he then moved to Himmler's personal staff as head of the sports office.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the confessional}} song talks plainly and plaintively about the {{detachment}} and loneliness that [...] Madonna feels {{in the face}} of the press, with the singer lamenting: [...] "Each time they write a hateful word / dragging my soul into the dirt / I wanna die." [...] John Marrs of Gay Times compared the lyrical content of the song to Madonna's [...] "Drowned World/Substitute For Love" [...] (1998) explaining that the lyrics are essentially autobiographical as well as talks about how her <b>outspokenness</b> had led to the media trying to [...] "hurt her". It also talks about how although Madonna is tough at heart, she still feels the [...] "negativity"of the media. The chorus, which features skittering drums and strings, has Madonna simply saying: [...] "I don't wanna talk about it right now / even hearts made out of steel can break down." [...] In an interview for The New York Times, Madonna explained the lyrics that she did not have the conviction of Joan of Arc, and is still hurt by any negative words.

500|$|Stevenson was {{appointed}} a High Court judge on 1 October 1957, and (as is traditional) was knighted {{a few days}} later. From 1958 until 1960 {{he was a member}} of an Inter-Departmental Committee on Human Artificial Insemination. For the first four years of his judicial career Stevenson was assigned to the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, after which he was transferred to the Queen's Bench Division, where he presided over criminal cases. He then began to attract press attention. Known for his <b>outspokenness,</b> Stevenson described one case as a [...] "pretty anaemic kind of rape", because the victim was the accused's ex-girlfriend and had been hitch-hiking, before sentencing the man to a two-year suspended sentence. To a man acquitted of rape, he remarked [...] "I see you come from Slough. It is a terrible place. You can go back there." [...] In similar vein he told a husband involved in a divorce case that his decision to live in Manchester was [...] "a wholly incomprehensible choice for any free man to make".|$|E
500|$|When Commandant of the Marine Corps Major General Wendell C. Neville died July 8, 1930, Butler, at {{that time}} the senior major general in the Corps, was a {{candidate}} for the position. Although he had significant support from many inside and outside the Corps, including John Lejeune and Josephus Daniels, two other Marine Corps generals were seriously considered, Ben H. Fuller and John H. Russell. Lejeune and others petitioned President Hoover, garnered support in the Senate and flooded Secretary of the Navy Charles Adams's desk with more than 2,500 letters of support. With the recent death of his influential father, however, Butler had lost much of his protection from his civilian superiors. The <b>outspokenness</b> that characterized his run-ins with the Mayor of Philadelphia, the [...] "unreliability" [...] mentioned by his superiors when opposing a posting to the Western Front, and his comments about Benito Mussolini resurfaced. In the end, the position of Commandant went to Fuller, who had more years of commissioned service than Butler and was considered less controversial. Butler requested retirement and left active duty on October 1, 1931.|$|E
500|$|As the {{daughter}} of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age. After embarking on her own career, she {{earned a reputation as}} a [...] "wild child," [...] which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism. In 2000, when asked about her <b>outspokenness,</b> she stated, [...] "I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand." [...] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, [...] "I'm so in love with my brother right now." [...] She dismissed the rumors, saying, [...] "It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus," [...] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.|$|E
500|$|Leaving for New England in 1636, he was warmly welcomed in Boston, {{where his}} brother-in-law's wife, Anne Hutchinson, was {{beginning}} to attract negative attention for her religious <b>outspokenness.</b> Soon he and Hutchinson accused {{the majority of the}} colony's ministers and magistrates of espousing a [...] "covenant of works". As the pitch of this controversy reached a peak, both Hutchinson and Wheelwright were banished from the colony. Wheelwright went north with a group of followers during the harsh winter of 1637–1638, and in April 1638 established the town of Exeter in what would become the Province of New Hampshire. Wheelwright's stay in Exeter lasted only a few years, because Massachusetts activated an earlier claim on the lands there, forcing the banished Wheelwright to leave. He went further east, to Wells, Maine, where he was living when his order of banishment was retracted, though it was done in a way that still placed guilt upon him. From Wells he returned to Massachusetts to preach at Hampton (later part of the Province of New Hampshire), where in 1654 his parishioners helped him get the complete vindication that he sought from the Massachusetts Court for the events of 17 years earlier.|$|E
500|$|Stationed on {{the border}} with France, Bär {{achieved}} his first victory—a Curtiss P-36 Hawk—on 25 September 1939 during the Phoney War air skirmishes with the Armée de l'Air (French air force), earning him the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 27 September 1939. During the Battle of France, he was credited with two more aerial victories before adding a further 10 during the Battle of Britain. During this time, he had several emergency landings in badly damaged aircraft and was shot down over the English Channel on 2 September 1940 by a Spitfire. Bär was summoned to appear before Hermann Göring and report on this battle. When Göring asked him what he was thinking about while in the water, Bär immediately replied, [...] "Your speech, Herr Reichsmarschall, in which you said that England is no longer an island!", alluding to an address that Göring had made before the German fighter pilots. Incidents like this are testimony to his often blatant disregard for higher authority. His <b>outspokenness</b> frequently landed him in trouble with Göring. In early 1941, he was credited with an additional four aerial victories against the Royal Air Force (RAF), bringing his total to 17.|$|E
