5|$|A {{central theme}} of President Obama's inaugural address was a call to restore responsibility—both in terms of {{accountability}} in Washington and the responsibility <b>of</b> <b>ordinary</b> <b>people</b> to get involved. Obama's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases. Instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin.|$|E

Furthermore, while near to major historical players, John's apartness from power allows Heyer to create a fuller depiction of his life without having to change major historical events.|$|E
5|$|The Eye of Ra was {{involved}} {{in many areas of}} ancient Egyptian religion, including in the cults of the many goddesses who are equated with it.

5|$|In 1898 {{a friend}} of Watts {{suggested}} to Henry Gamble, Vicar of St Botolph's Aldersgate, that should the church manage to purchase the land owned by the CPF {{it would make a}} suitable site for Watts's memorial. Watts was approached, and agreed to the suggestion. On 13October 1898 the appeal was relaunched, with the proposal that if the remaining £3,000 were raised, Watts would design and build a covered way, which in due course would be lined with memorial tablets to commemorate the bravery <b>of</b> <b>ordinary</b> <b>people.</b> Watts planned to build a covered way around three sides of a quadrangle, with the roof supported on stone or timber columns.|$|E

5|$|The aim of Calvin's {{political}} theory was {{to safeguard the}} rights and freedoms <b>of</b> <b>ordinary</b> <b>people.</b> Although {{he was convinced that}} the Bible contained no blueprint for a certain form of government, Calvin favored a combination of democracy and aristocracy (mixed government). He appreciated the advantages of democracy. To further minimize the misuse of political power, Calvin proposed to divide it among several political institutions like the aristocracy, lower estates, or magistrates in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Finally, Calvin taught that if rulers rise up against God they lose their divine right and must be deposed. State and church are separate, though they have to cooperate to the benefit of the people. Christian magistrates {{have to make sure that}} the church can fulfill its duties in freedom. In extreme cases the magistrates have to expel or execute dangerous heretics. But nobody can be forced to become a Protestant.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of zduhaći {{was not much}} different from that <b>of</b> <b>ordinary</b> <b>people,</b> but they had some traits that set them apart. They were deep sleepers, very hard to wake up, often drowsy, pensive, thoughtful, and solemn. Their faces were often puffy, eyes shadowy. They were wise and shrewd, successful in whatever they were doing and resourceful in dealing with problems; their households were prosperous. In Semberija, zduhaći were said to be good scapulimantic diviners, {{and to be able to}} communicate with domestic animals. The clan of Paštrovići from Montenegrin Littoral claimed that the zduhaći could hear any doings anywhere in the world; if someone stepped on a zduhać's foot, they could hear that too. The clan of Kuči held that the zduhaći were outstanding long jumpers.|$|E
5|$|The economic, {{social and}} {{cultural}} dislocation <b>of</b> <b>ordinary</b> <b>people,</b> the economic hardship of an economy in transition, and the pressures of meteorological disasters all contributed to growing problems in Central Europe. The failure {{of most of the}} governments to deal with the food crisis of the mid-1840s, caused by the potato blight (related to the Great Irish Famine) and several seasons of bad weather, encouraged many to think that the rich and powerful had no interest in their problems. Those in authority were concerned about the growing unrest, political and social agitation among the working classes, and the disaffection of the intelligentsia. No amount of censorship, fines, imprisonment, or banishment, it seemed, could stem the criticism. Furthermore, it was becoming increasingly clear that both Austria and Prussia wanted to be the leaders in any resulting unification; each would inhibit the drive of the other to achieve unification.|$|E
