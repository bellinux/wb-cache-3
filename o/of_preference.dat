In 1999, Coghill noted that he began using a 1970 Slingerland drum kit, citing that it had a better sound than a new kit, and was cheaper. Coghill uses Avedis Zildjian cymbals.

50|$|The {{research}} of Falk can broadly {{be divided into}} two main areas, the analysis <b>of</b> economic <b>preferences</b> and psychological aspects of the labor market. A better understanding <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> and personality is of great importance for economic and social science, as virtually every model in that area needs to make assumptions on individual behavior. A key focus has been the analysis <b>of</b> social <b>preferences,</b> as well risk and time preferences, but also personality. Supported by an ERC Starting Grant, Falk studies the distribution <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> in the population as well as socioeconomic determinants <b>of</b> <b>preferences.</b>|$|R

Modern applications seek to employ preferences as means for specifying, designing, and controlling rational behaviors as well as descriptive means for understanding behaviors.

5|$|Various {{research}} methods {{are used to}} calculate price elasticities in real life, including analysis of historic sales data, both public and private, and use of present-day surveys of customers' preferences to build up test markets capable of modelling such changes. Alternatively, conjoint analysis (a ranking of users' preferences which can then be statistically analysed) may be used. Approximate estimates of price elasticity can be calculated from the income elasticity of demand, under conditions <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> independence. This approach has been emprirically validated using bundles of goods (e.g. food, healthcare, education, recreation, etc.).|$|E
5|$|A test in 1997 {{showed that}} P. labiata from the Philippines and from Sri Lanka have similar {{preferences}} for {{different types of}} prey, and that the order <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> is: web spiders; jumping spiders; and insects. These preferences apply to both live prey and motionless lures, and to P. labiata specimens without prey for 7days ("well-fed") and without prey for 14days ("starved"). P. labiata specimens without prey for 21days ("extra-starved") showed no preference for different types of prey. The test included as prey several species of web spiders and jumping spiders, and {{the selection of the}} prey species showed no evidence of affecting the results. Insects were represented by the house fly Musca domestica.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} our paper is to argue that Sen?s liberal paradox compels to choose a new {{formalism}} in terms <b>of</b> metaranking <b>of</b> <b>preferences.</b> One should complete the traditional structure <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> by taking individual motivations into account.

5|$|Reed's {{leadership}} in dealmaking with Senate Republicans kept the 1956 {{version of the}} flag off Perdue's statewide referendum on the flag in 2003. The referendum was originally a two-part referendum pitting the 2001 version of the flag against the proposed version and conditional on failed ratification of a new flag considering other flags including the 1956 version. Under this format if the legislators did not approve the newly designed flag over the existing one they could have pursued other designs including {{the one with the}} controversial 1956 version of the flag.

5|$|Since November 2002, by-elections {{have been}} held to fill vacancies. Two by-elections were held in 2003, one in 2004, four in 2005, one in each of 2007, 2008 and 2009, two in 2010, four in 2011, two in 2013, four in 2014, six in 2015, two in 2016 and two in 2017. Voting is by {{preferential}} voting, with peers ranking the candidates in order <b>of</b> <b>preference.</b> As many or as few preferences as desired may be indicated. To win the election, a peer must receive a majority of first preference votes. If no candidate receives such a majority, the candidate with the fewest number of first preference votes is eliminated, with each of his votes being redistributed according to the second preference marked on the ballot (see Instant-runoff voting). The process is continued until one candidate receives a majority.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{became more}} popular still {{following}} the French Revolution and the aftermath in which hunting {{was no longer}} restricted to the nobility. Although spread throughout France, a large concentration was located in the north west where the weather resistant coat of the breed made it ideal for the wooded and swampy conditions. During the early 19th century, British hunters crossed the channel to hunt in the grounds of north west France. The British brought their own hunting dogs, and {{this resulted in a}} change <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> as French hunters switched to English breeds and caused a major blow to the existence of the Picardy Spaniel. In addition the infusion of blood from the English Setter into the local spaniel population created the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E

5|$|The {{elections}} for {{officers of the}} House were held on 27 and 28 October 1999, while those for peers elected by party were held on 3 and 4 November; the results were proclaimed to the House on 29 October and 5 November. Voters were required to rank in order <b>of</b> <b>preference,</b> on a ballot prepared by the Clerk of the Parliaments, as many candidates as there were places to be filled. The candidates receiving {{the greatest number of}} votes (without regard to the ranking on the ballots, so in effect block voting) were declared elected. Only if there were ties would the ranking be examined. Thereafter, until November 2002, if a vacancy occurred, the next-highest vote-getter (the rankings being examined, again, only in the case of ties) in the original election would fill the seat. This procedure was used on two occasions.|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in 1979 in Advances in the Study of Affect, vol. 5, and in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> for gender in sexual partners.|$|E
