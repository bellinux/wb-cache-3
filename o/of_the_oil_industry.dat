25|$|Introduced by the Liberal {{government}} under Pierre Trudeau on October 28, 1980, the controversial National Energy Program (NEP) had three objectives: energy self-sufficiency; redistributing wealth from a non-sustainable resource {{to benefit the}} country as a whole; and increased ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry</b> by Canadians.

Based on his own experience as a worker in the India Office, as well as his work on development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry</b> in the region of Borysław and the official census data published by the Austro-Hungarian government, he described Galicia as one of the poorest regions in Europe.|$|E

25|$|The Venezuelan {{general strike}} of 2002–2003, {{also known as}} the oil strike or oil lockout, was an attempt by the Venezuelan {{opposition}} to President Hugo Chávez to force a new presidential election.

The main impact of the strike derived from the stoppage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry,</b> in particular the state-run PDVSA, which provides a majority of Venezuelan export revenue. The strike was preceded by the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt in April 2002, and a one-day strike in October 2002.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry</b> had {{an effect}} on Kirkuk's demographics. The exploitation of Kirkuk's oil, which began around 1930, attracted both Arabs and Kurds to the city in search of work. Kirkuk, which had been a predominantly Turkmen city, gradually lost its uniquely Turkmen character. At the same time, large numbers of Kurds from the mountains were settling in the uninhabited but cultivable rural parts of the district of Kirkuk. The influx of Kurds into Kirkuk continued through the 1960s. According to the 1957 census, Kirkuk city was 37.63% Iraqi Turkmen, 33.26% Kurdish with Arabs and Assyrians making up less than 23% of its population.|$|E

It is worth mentioning that Agha Petros, General of the Assyrian Army, attended the opening ceremonies. The United States stood with Great Britain in these deliberations, the latter promising 20% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry</b> business be awarded to American companies. Turkey lost its appeal to win Mosul back based on Great Britain's claims that the region would be saved for the future settlement of the Kurdish and Assyrian people, but no final agreement was reached.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of oil {{brought with it}} an influx of workers from India in the 1960s. Many came via sea, a trip of about three days from Bombay (now Mumbai) to Dubai. Most of the shopkeepers were {{from the state of}} Kerala, or were Indian Arabs, descendants of Arabs who had previously emigrated to India. It was also in the late 1960s that the Hindu Temple and first Indian schools were built for expatriate Indian families. Indian migration to the UAE drastically increased in the 1970s and 1980s, with the expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry</b> and the growth of free trade in Dubai.

25|$|The first well dug in Los Angeles was in 1863, on Hoover Street between Seventh Street and Wilshire Boulevard, by a {{man named}} Baker. However, in his book Petroleum in California: A Concise and Reliable History <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oil</b> <b>Industry</b> of the State, Lionel V. Redpath says the Los Angeles oil {{industry}} began with the Doheny and Canfield well at the corner of Patton and West State streets. The well was a small producer, but it pumped steadily for three years, and during that time Doheny and others sunk about three hundred more wells. Doheny and Canfield soon made a fortune by drilling in the area and selling the oil to nearby factories. Later, they helped spur the California oil boom of the early 1900s by persuading railroads to switch from coal to oil to power their locomotives.|$|E
25|$|Petro-Canada {{overestimated}} {{the future}} price of oil, and consequently paid high {{prices for the}} oil assets it acquired, which subsequently fell considerably in value. Its assumption that big new oil discoveries would {{be made in the}} Arctic and off the Atlantic coast turned out to be incorrect. Petro-Canada has since abandoned all the wells Panarctic drilled, and the discoveries it did make off the Atlantic coast were fewer, more expensive, and took longer to develop than expected. Hibernia did not produce oil until 1997 and Terra Nova until 2002. The government also expected Petro-Canada to force down what it considered the high price of gasoline to consumers, but Petro-Canada's oil production was more expensive and its oil refineries less efficient than those of the competing multi-national companies, and it found itself losing money on all aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E

500|$|Milford Haven has {{experienced}} a history of boom and slump in shipbuilding, fishing, as a railhead and an ocean terminal. At {{the height of the}} fishing boom, it was said that [...] "every day was a pay day". [...] In 1921, 674 people were identified as working in the fishing industry, the leading occupation in the town, followed by transport and communication [...] with [...] 600 employees. The development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry</b> also helped to boost the town's fortunes. [...] However, the slumps have been just as severe, the area being scheduled as 'distressed' in the inter-war period. During the 1980s and 1990s, the unemployment rate at times topped 30%, and the major industry of oil refining created no more than 2,000 direct or indirect jobs. Into the new millennium, its fortunes have risen, as can be witnessed in the activity surrounding the LNG terminal, and the new building works which accompanied it and its connection to the controversial South Wales Gas Pipeline. In February 2003, Pembrokeshire Council granted outline planning permission to Petroplus for an LNG storage depot at Waterston, and in March 2004, an additional site was approved at South Hook for ExxonMobil.|$|E
