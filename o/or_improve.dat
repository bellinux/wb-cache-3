5|$|Both {{environmental}} factors and genetics {{are associated with}} alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is {{three to four times}} more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent <b>or</b> <b>improve</b> symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E

In the opening chapter, the dean of his architecture school tells Roark that the best architecture must copy the past rather than innovate <b>or</b> <b>improve.</b> Roark repeatedly loses jobs with architectural firms and commissions from clients because he is unwilling to copy conventional architectural styles. In contrast, Keating's mimicry of convention brings him top honors in school and an immediate job offer.

5|$|The BBC {{and other}} DAB {{broadcasters}} have been encouraging DAB take up by promoting {{a number of}} features which are either new <b>or</b> <b>improve</b> upon former technology in their sales literature. The benefit of DAB is that due {{to the use of}} multiplexing technology and encoding technology, broadcasters including the BBC and EMAP have been able to launch exclusive digital radio stations alongside their existing analogue radio stations. Broadcasters also state that DAB offers better reception, without the problems of interference that are more noticeable through analogue radio. DAB radios also come with features such as station lists, so listeners do not need to retune their receivers, as well as scrolling text, providing information such as breaking news, travel information or the latest track information.|$|E
5|$|In {{his paper}} The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories, philosopher Michael Stocker {{challenges}} Kantian ethics (and all modern ethical theories) {{by arguing that}} actions from duty lack certain moral value. He gives the example of Smith, who visits his friend in hospital out of duty, rather than because of the friendship; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing. Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point. After presenting {{a number of reasons}} that we might find acting out of duty objectionable, she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is. Acting out of duty is not intrinsically wrong, but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do. Duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal: one may have a duty to cultivate their character <b>or</b> <b>improve</b> their personal relationships. Baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motiveâ€”that is, a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done, rather than prompt specific actions. She argues that, seen this way, duty neither reveals a deficiency in one's natural inclinations to act, nor undermines the motives and feelings that are essential to friendship. For Baron, being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act; rather, it entails that considerations of duty are always action-guiding. A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions, such as questions of character. These should guide moral agents to act from duty.|$|E
