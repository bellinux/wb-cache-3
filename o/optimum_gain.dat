50|$|In {{its most}} common form, an output coupler {{consists}} of a partially reflective mirror, sometimes called a beamsplitter. The reflectance and transmittance of the mirror is usually determined by the gain of the laser medium. In some lasers the gain is very low, so the beam must make hundreds of passes through the medium for sufficient gain. In this case the output coupler may {{be as high as}} 99% reflective, transmitting only 1% of the cavity's beam to be used. A dye laser has very high gain compared to most solid-state lasers, so the beam needs to make just a few passes through the liquid to reach its <b>optimum</b> <b>gain,</b> thus the output coupler is typically around 80% reflective. In others, such as an excimer laser, the 4% reflectivity of uncoated glass provides enough of a mirror, transmitting nearly 96% of the intracavity beam.|$|E

The dissertation objective was to maintain the highest network availability for a mobile ad hoc network with heterogeneous communication capabilities.

For a 11 configuration, polarization reciprocity was used to exploit the polarized channel knowledge, thereby maximizing received uplink power. The <b>optimum</b> <b>gains</b> to maximize uplink capacity were also derived for varying channel cross-polarization values.
