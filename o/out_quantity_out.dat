Thereupon, we show that these gauge-invariant combinations can be identified with measurable perturbations to the particle and energy densities. In the radiation-dominated era we find, for small-scale perturbations, acoustic waves with an increasing amplitude, while standard treatments predict acoustic waves with a decaying amplitude. For large-scale perturbations we find exactly the same growth rates as in the standard literature. When considering the non-relativistic limit of the linearized Einstein equations we find the Poisson equation. It is shown, using the linearized Einstein equations, that the usual Newtonian treatment of density perturbations does not describe the evolution of density perturbations.

Fundamental difficulties remain with leakage of energy to the stratospheric level, particularly above strong initial jet streams associated in part with regions of steep terrain. The spectral error growth study represents the first comparison of general circulation model spectral energetics predictions with the corresponding observational spectra on a day by day basis. The major conclusion is that eddy kinetics energy can be correct while significant errors occur in the kinetic energy of wavenumber 3. Both the model and observations show evidence of single wavenumber dominance in eddy kinetic energy and the correlation of spectral kinetics and potential energy...|$|R

Some birds collect stems and fragments of dry grasses as nesting materials but others do not bother. Sometimes a beakful of materials is taken underground, only to be brought out again and discarded.

This is a practice in which the pair approach each other, each wagging its head from side to side, and then rattle their beaks together. This seems to be an important element of their courtship behaviour because it happens repeatedly, and the birds continue to bill, to a lesser extent, throughout the breeding season.|$|R

Thereupon, we show that these gaugeinvariant combinations can be identified with measurable perturbations to the particle and energy densities.

Next, we recombine the linearized perturbation equations, which still contain gauge functions, {{in such a way that}} the resulting equations contain only gauge-invariant quantities; as it should be, all gauge functions have disappeared. In this way, we have arrived at a formulation of the equations for cosmological perturbations that is manifestly gauge-invariant.

40|$|We {{show that}} the gauge {{invariant}} treatment of the Schwinger-Dyson equations of QCD leads to an infrared finite gluon propagator, signaling the dynamical generation of an effective gluon mass, and a non-enhanced ghost propagator, in qualitative agreement with recent lattice data. The truncation scheme employed {{is based on the}} synergy between the pinch technique and the background field method. One of its most powerful features is that the transversality of the gluon self-energy is manifestly preserved, exactly as dictated by the BRST symmetry of the theory. We then explain, {{for the first time in}} the literature, how to construct non-perturbatively a renormalization group invariant <b>quantity</b> <b>out</b> of the conventional gluon propagator. This newly constructed quantity serves as the natural starting point for defining a non-perturbative effective charge for QCD, which constitutes, in all respects, the generalization in a non-Abelian context of the universal QED effective charge. This strong effective charge displays asymptotic freedom in the ultraviolet, while in the low-energy regime it freezes at a finite value, giving rise to an infrared fixed point for QCD. Some possible pitfalls related to the extraction of such an effective charge from infrared finite gluon propagators, such as those found on the lattice, are briefly discussed.

40|$|Aims : The {{passage of}} seeds through the {{earthworm}} gut potentially damages seeds, altering seed and seedling performances depending on seed traits. This work {{was conducted to}} study to what extent chemical and morphological seed traits determine the seed attractiveness for earthworms. Methods : We tested seed selection via the ingestion and digestion of 23 grassland plant species spanning a range of 14 morphological and chemical traits by two common earthworm species: the anecic Lumbricus terrestris and the endogeic Allolobophora chlorotica. Results : Both earthworm species ingested seeds from all plant species. A. chlorotica digested almost all ingested seeds (out of the 15 % ingested), whereas L. terrestris excreted them in varying <b>quantities</b> (<b>out</b> of the 86 % ingested), depending on plant species identity. Seed ingestion rate by L. terrestris was driven by seed oil content and earthworm initial weight. The apparent effect of seed length was explained via seed oil content. Seed digestion rate by L. terrestris was negatively impacted by seed size. Seed ingestion rate by A. chlorotica tended to be impacted by seed protein content and seed length. Conclusion : Earthworms&# 8211;seed interactions depend {{on a variety of}} seed traits and earthworm identity. Thus, earthworms, via their specific feeding behavior, might facilitate or impede the regeneration of certain plant species and drive plant communities...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} predict {{short-term}} {{variations in the}} Earth's rotation has gained importance in recent years owing to more precise spacecraft tracking requirements. Universal time (UT 1), that component of the Earth's orientation corresponding to the rotation angle, can be measured by number of high-precision space geodetic techniques. A Kalman filter developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) optimally combines these different data sets and generates a smoothed times series {{and a set of}} predictions for UT 1, as well as for additional Earth orientation components. These UT 1 predictions utilize an empirically derived random walk stochastic model for the length of the day (LOD) and require frequent and up-to-date measurements of either UT 1 or LOD to keep errors from quickly accumulating. Recent studies have shown that LOD variations are correlated with changes in the Earth's axial atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) over timescales of several years down to as little as 8 days. AAM estimates and forecasts out to 10 days are routinely available from meteorological analysis centers; these data can supplement geodetic measurements to improve the short-term prediction of LOD and have therefore been incorporated as independent data types in the JPL Kalman filter. We find that AAM and, to a lesser extent, AAM forecast data are extremely helpful in generating accurate near-real-time estimates of UT 1 and LOD and in improving short-term predictions of these <b>quantities</b> <b>out</b> to about 10 days...|$|R
