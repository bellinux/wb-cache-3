5|$|A {{habitat is}} an {{ecological}} <b>or</b> <b>environmental</b> {{area that is}} inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.|$|E
5|$|According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, sound biofuel {{production}} practices would not hamper food and fibre production, nor cause water <b>or</b> <b>environmental</b> problems, and would enhance soil fertility. The selection of {{land on which}} to grow the feedstocks is {{a critical component of}} the ability of biofuels to deliver sustainable solutions. A key consideration is the minimisation of biofuel competition for prime cropland.|$|E
5|$|River otters {{are active}} year-round, and are most active {{at night and}} during crepuscular hours.

River otters only settle in areas that consist of vegetation, rock piles, and sufficient coverage.|$|E

5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} (a sudden worsening of symptoms) {{is commonly}} triggered by infection <b>or</b> <b>environmental</b> pollutants, or sometimes by other {{factors such as}} improper use of medications. Infections {{appear to be the}} cause of 50 to 75% of cases, with bacteria in 25%, viruses in 25%, and both in 25%. Environmental pollutants include both poor indoor and outdoor air quality. Exposure to personal smoke and secondhand smoke increases the risk. Cold temperature may also play a role, with exacerbations occurring more commonly in winter. Those with more severe underlying disease have more frequent exacerbations: in mild disease 1.8 per year, moderate 2 to 3 per year, and severe 3.4 per year. Those with many exacerbations have a faster rate of deterioration of their lung function. Pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lungs) can worsen symptoms in those with pre-existing COPD. Signs of PE in COPD include pleuritic chest pain and heart failure without signs of infection.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the T cell-mediated {{mechanism}} of mucosal destruction is strong, but the exact triggers for this process are unknown and {{are thought to}} be multiple and varied from one person to the next. This suggests {{that there are a number}} of possible triggers, each of which is capable of producing the disease in different subgroups. In other words, different subgroups appear to have different causes for the condition. These can be considered in three general groups, namely primary immuno-dysregulation, decrease of the mucosal barrier and states of heightened antigenic sensitivity (see below). Risk factors in aphthous stomatitis are also sometimes considered as either host-related <b>or</b> <b>environmental.</b>|$|E
5|$|Physiological serpin {{polymers}} {{are thought}} to form via domain swapping events, where a segment of one serpin protein inserts into another. Domain-swaps occur when mutations <b>or</b> <b>environmental</b> factors interfere with {{the final stages of}} serpin folding to the native state, causing high-energy intermediates to misfold. Both dimer and trimer domain-swap structures have been solved. In the dimer (of antithrombin), the RCL and part of the A-sheet incorporates into the A-sheet of another serpin molecule. The domain-swapped trimer (of antitrypsin) forms via the exchange of an entirely different region of the structure, the B-sheet (with each molecule's RCL inserted into its own A-sheet). It has also been proposed that serpins may form domain-swaps by inserting the RCL of one protein into the A-sheet of another (A-sheet polymerisation). These domain-swapped dimer and trimer structures are though to be the building blocks of the disease-causing polymer aggregates, but the exact mechanism is still unclear.|$|E

5|$|The {{parents of}} the {{affected}} individual are typically genetically normal. The extra chromosome occurs by chance. The possibility increases from less than 0.1% in 20-year-old mothers to 3% in those age 45. There is no known behavioral activity <b>or</b> <b>environmental</b> factor that changes the possibility. Down syndrome can be identified during pregnancy by prenatal screening followed by diagnostic testing or after birth by direct observation and genetic testing. More children are born with Down syndrome in countries where abortion is not allowed and in countries where pregnancy more commonly occurs at a later age. About 1.4 per 1000 live births in the United States and 1.1 per 1000 live births in Norway are affected. In the 1950s, in the United States, it occurred in 2 per 1000 live births with the decrease since then due to prenatal screening and abortions. The number of pregnancies with Down syndrome is more than two times greater with many spontaneously aborting. It {{is the cause of}} 8% of all congenital disorders.|$|E

5|$|Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption—shortened to Redemption—is a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) presented {{primarily from}} the third-person perspective; the playable character is shown on the screen while an optional first-person mode used to view the character's immediate environment is available. The camera can be freely rotated around the character and positioned above it to give a greater overview of the immediate area. The game follows a linear, mission-based structure. Interaction is achieved by using a mouse to click on an enemy <b>or</b> <b>environmental</b> object to attack it or to activate it. Interaction is context based; clicking on an enemy initiates combat, while clicking on a door causes it to open or close.|$|E
5|$|In metapopulation terminology, {{migrating}} {{individuals are}} classed as emigrants (when they leave a region) or immigrants (when they enter a region), and sites are classed either as sources or sinks. A {{site is a}} generic term that refers to places where ecologists sample populations, such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of juveniles that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch <b>or</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions become more favourable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology. The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization. Small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable. Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and field studies to explain metapopulation structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between {{external and internal}} environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration {{of cause and effect}} between the environment and life. The laws of thermodynamics, for example, apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated material parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes; however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or holocoenotic system as it was once called. This is known as the dialectical approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts, but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or umwelt). Change in one ecological <b>or</b> <b>environmental</b> factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem.|$|E
