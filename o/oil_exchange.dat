40|$|The paper {{employs a}} {{heuristic}} comparative approach suggested by Ismail (2009) {{to search for}} evidence of Dutch disease in oil-rich countries of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). While these countries have benefitted from high international oil prices in recent years, they have also experienced relatively large real exchange rate appreciations, raising concerns regarding the presence of Dutch disease and casting doubts {{on their ability to}} achieve high growth and employment in the long run. To isolate from any dynamics related to the exchange rate regime, we focus on the 14 member countries that constitute the CFA franc zone. We separate them into net oil importers and net oil exporters and look at economic growth, the real exchange rate, and the agricultural and external sectors. Based on traditional models, our findings are broadly consistent with the presence of Dutch disease in the second group during the oil-price boom. Departing from these models yields mixed results, suggesting the need to employ a case-by-case approach.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} likely {{implications}} of declining oil production on Yemen''s equilibrium exchange rate, and discusses policy options {{to ensure a}} smooth transition to a nonoil economy. The empirical results suggest that, as oil production and foreign exchange earnings fall, the Yemeni rial will have to adjust downward in real effective terms {{to keep pace with}} the equilibrium exchange rate. In light of strong pass-through from exchange rate depreciation to domestic inflation, this could entail a substantial depreciation in nominal terms. Given the nature of the adjustment, a floating exchange rate regime appears to be the best option, if supported by appropriate macroeconomic policies. However, given public fixation on a exchange rate stability, a softly managed float would be a better option for Yemen whereby the central bank may have to lead the market toward the equilibrium exchange rate.

We first provide a {{brief review of}} the literature on Dutch Disease and the natural resource curse. We then discuss the symptoms of Dutch Disease, which include (1) real exchange rate appreciation; (2) slower manufacturing growth; (3) faster service sector growth; and (4) higher overall wages. We test these predictions for Russia while carefully controlling for other factors that could have led to similar symptoms. We conclude that, while Russia has all of the symptoms, the diagnosis of Dutch Disease remains to be confirmed.

30|$|The {{determinants}} of exchange rates have attracted considerable attention among researchers {{over the past}} several decades. Most studies, however, ignore the possibility that the impact of <b>oil</b> shocks on <b>exchange</b> rates could vary across the exchange rate returns distribution. We employ a quantile regression approach to address this issue. Our results indicate that the effect of <b>oil</b> shocks on <b>exchange</b> rates is heterogeneous across quantiles. A large US depreciation or appreciation tends to heighten the effects of <b>oil</b> shocks on <b>exchange</b> rate returns. Positive oil demand shocks lead to appreciation pressures in oil-exporting countries and this result is robust across lower and upper return distributions. These results offer rich and useful information for investors and decision-makers.|$|R

30|$|Since Golub (1983) and Krugman (1983) {{put forth}} {{arguments}} {{as to why}} movements in oil prices should affect exchange rates, numerous {{studies have examined the}} relationship between <b>oil</b> prices and <b>exchange</b> rates. Some studies present evidence of a weak nexus between oil price shocks and exchange rates. For instance, Huang and Guo (2007) suggest that real oil price shocks led to a minor appreciation in China’s real exchange rate. Basher et al. (2012) also examine the relationship between <b>oil</b> prices, <b>exchange</b> rates and stock prices, offering limited support for the relationship between <b>oil</b> prices and <b>exchange</b> rates. Reboredo (2012) finds that the dependence between <b>oil</b> prices and <b>exchange</b> rates is weak and there is no extreme market dependence between <b>oil</b> prices and <b>exchange</b> rates. On the other hand, more studies reveal that oil price shocks are the determinants of exchange rates. Amano and Van Norden (1998) conclude that the oil price causes persistent US dollar real exchange rate shocks. Using panel co-integration techniques, Camarero and Tamarit (2002) find that real oil price {{is one of the main}} determinants of the long-term real exchange rate for the Spanish peseta. Furthermore, there is considerable disagreement about whether the relationship between <b>oil</b> prices and <b>exchange</b> rates is positive or negative. A number of studies find a positive link between the oil price and the US dollar, meaning that an increase in the price of oil is associated with US dollar appreciation (e.g., Akram 2004; Rautava 2004; Benassy-Quere et al. 2007; Chen and Chen 2007; Coudert et al. 2008; Ghosh 2011; Cavalcanti and Jalles 2013). By contrast, some studies conclude that there is a depreciation of US dollar exchange rates following a rise in the price of oil (e.g., Narayan et al. 2008; Askari and Krichene 2010; Wu et al. 2012; Ji and Fan 2012; Aloui et al. 2013; Turhan et al. 2013).|$|R

This paper examines the short- and long-run interdependence between world <b>oil</b> prices, lira-dollar <b>exchange</b> rate, and individual agricultural commodity prices (wheat, maize, cotton, soybeans, and sunflower) in Turkey. To this end, the Toda-Yamamoto causality approach and generalized impulse-response analysis for identification of the long- and short-run interrelationships are applied to the monthly data spanning from January 1994 to March 2010. The impulse-response analysis suggests the Turkish agricultural prices do not significantly react to <b>oil</b> price and <b>exchange</b> rate shocks in the short-run. The long-run causality analysis reveals that the changes in oil prices and appreciation/depreciation of the Turkish lira are not transmitted to agricultural commodity prices in Turkey.
