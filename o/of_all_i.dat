25|$|Clarkson's fourth album, All I Ever Wanted, was {{released}} on March 10, 2009. Clarkson continued to co-write her own material, {{but this time she}} returned to a mainstream-oriented sound by reuniting with previous collaborators Dr. Luke, Martin, and DioGuardi, and new collaborators Howard Benson, Claude Kelly, Ryan Tedder, Glen Ballard, Matt Thiessen and Katy Perry in contributing tracks for the album. The release <b>of</b> <b>All</b> <b>I</b> Ever Wanted was met with positive acclaim from music critics for its lighter themes. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and staying there for two weeks. The album has sold 960,000 copies in the U.S. and garnered Clarkson a nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards.|$|E

In 1935, King George V and Queen Mary celebrated their silver jubilee, with celebrations taking place throughout the British Empire. In his jubilee speech, George paid public tribute to his wife, having told his speechwriter, [...] "Put that paragraph at the very end.

500|$|Despite her {{dissatisfaction with}} the song's release as a single, Clarkson began {{promoting}} it in July 2009, performing it live on the Late Show with David Letterman and other talk shows. In the fall, she performed the song on VH1 Divas and at the American Music Awards. She [...] included [...] "Already Gone" [...] in the encore set of her 2009 All I Ever Wanted Tour. Clarkson has also performed the song in tours after. The song has received much praise from music critics, and is {{regarded as one of}} the highlights <b>of</b> <b>All</b> <b>I</b> Ever Wanted. Critics have praised the song for its expressions of vulnerability, its emotional impact, and its successful use of the ballad form. It peaked at number13 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was certified Platinum in Canada and Gold in Australia.|$|E

[...] Four singles were released from the album: the title track [...] "All I Want Is You", [...] "Sure Thing", [...] "Quickie", and [...] "Girls Like You". As the title track gradually received radio airplay, Miguel began touring as a supporting act for Usher and Trey Songz.

500|$|The {{video was}} shot over four days, {{with an extra}} day allotted for re-shooting some of the scenes. Originally Lambert had casts taken of Robinson's face, hand and feet to create the statue of the saint which would {{be used as a}} decoration. The actor only enacted the live scenes. However during post-production, Lambert found that the statue did not look like Robinson, who was asked to re-shoot the {{respective}} scenes. He had to act as the statue and required special make-up for the retakes. The actor recalled that standing like a statue was difficult since [...] "first <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> didn't realize how hard it is on the back to stand absolutely tall and straight and not move. Secondly, as a performer you have this nervous energy—and my requirements here were total antithesis of that." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Already Gone" [...] {{received}} universal {{critical acclaim}} and {{is regarded as}} one of the musical and lyrical highlights <b>of</b> <b>All</b> <b>I</b> Ever Wanted. Ryan Brockington from The New York Post called the song a [...] "mixture of old school Stevie Nicks and some Julia Roberts romantic comedy theme song, delivered together in true Clarkson fashion." [...] He continues, [...] "she spits emotion and heart into a song that makes me want to curl up in a blanket and long for someone". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly said Clarkson [...] "knows that the anguish she likes to sing about is enjoyed by millions of people as grandiose admissions of vulnerability. Yet the music that delivers that message is anything but vulnerable. There's a reason they call them power ballads: a sad song blasted at full volume is a metaphor for finding strength in pain." [...] His point was echoed by Danton of [...] The Hartford Courant, who stated that Clarkson [...] "pours on the heartache", and by Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, who called the song an [...] "extravagant ballad".|$|E

500|$|The Allied {{disaster}} at Austerlitz significantly {{shook the}} faith of Emperor Francis in the British-led war effort. France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both {{the war and the}} Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lunéville between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in Italy and Bavaria, and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Napoleon went on to say, [...] "The battle of Austerlitz is the finest <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have fought". Frank McLynn suggests that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost touch with reality, and what used to be French foreign policy became a [...] "personal Napoleonic one". Vincent Cronin disagrees, stating that Napoleon was not overly ambitious for himself, [...] "he embodied the ambitions of thirty million Frenchmen".|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the role, Kensit spent three days shadowing a real nurse, and observed open heart surgery being performed as research. She commented on the experience: [...] "I wanted to throw up. First <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> stood in the corner {{but in the end}} I couldn't get close enough ... nurses are incredible women. They're doing this job for next to nothing and do it with such love and care... I couldn't do it, I'd get too emotionally involved, I don't think I could cope." [...] In 2001, Kensit had made a guest appearance in series 16 of Holby City sister show Casualty, appearing as a domestic abuse victim and giving what TV critic Ian Hyland deemed [...] "a convincing performance". Prior to her move into television roles, Kensit had predominantly worked in films, but explained upon joining the cast of Holby City: [...] "Making films isn't for me any more because I'm an old girl in that world ... I've been very lucky, this is something I grew up doing, in television there's so much satisfaction ... I'll stay as long as they want me, I feel like I've come back home." ...|$|E
500|$|Warren {{noted that}} Washington, D.C. had many memorials, {{but that this}} area, with the forest as a [...] "living memorial," [...] would have [...] "greatly pleased" [...] Kennedy for two reasons. First, Kennedy himself had spoken of the {{importance}} of planting trees in Israel, when he had addressed a 1958 Jewish National Fund meeting while serving as a junior Senator from Massachusetts, saying, [...] "What work could be more heartwarming or more enduring than the great forest at Jerusalem. Your children and grandchildren when they visit Israel will find your monument". [...] Second, Warren recalled that Kennedy had visited Israel twice, the first time in 1939 when it was still part of the British Mandate, and the second time in 1951. Speaking in 1951 {{of the differences between the}} people he witnessed during those two visits, he said that [...] "Perhaps the greatest change <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> found in the hearts and minds of the people, For unlike the discouraged settlers of 1939 they looked to the future with hope. I found a revival of an ancient spirit". Warren concluded his remarks by saying he would use the same word that President Kennedy would have used: [...] "Shalom." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{established}} {{actors were}} {{considered for the}} leading role of Rusty Sabich. Kevin Costner turned down the role, and Robert Redford was vetoed by Pollack due to his age. When he was hired to direct the film, Pakula only offered the role to Harrison Ford, believing that the actor possessed an [...] "Everyman quality" [...] that best suited the character. [...] Ford's casting was confirmed in March 1989. He received a $7 million salary for the role. Turow was initially uncertain of Ford portraying Rusty but relented after seeing {{a few of the}} actor's films. Ford said, [...] "Friends warned me this was a tough role because Rusty is such a passive, interior character. Though Rusty's in every scene, all the action takes place around him. Things happen to him." [...] Upon being cast, Ford read the novel to avoid arguments over events and details that were left out in the book. Ford also suggested to Pakula that Rusty have a buzz cut. He explained, [...] "There are many things I found I could express with that short haircut. Simplest <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> wanted to tell the audience to leave their baggage at home — not to expect the Harrison Ford they've seen before." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2013, Beyoncé {{embarked}} {{her fourth}} concert tour, The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour. In June 2013, {{it was announced}} that a limited edition of Heat, titled Heat: The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, would be released the same month, inspired by the tour. Speaking about the fragrance, Beyoncé said: [...] "I love my music, I love performing and most <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> love and appreciate my fans. I wanted to give them a special remembrance of this tour and I created this scent to reflect the power, passion and playfulness I put into my performances." [...] The fragrance opens with mangosteen, black pepper and Açaí palm as its top notes and later continues with violet petals, Indian Sambac Jasmine and a Brassia Edua Loo orchid as its middle notes before finishing with bourbon vanilla, Australian sandalwood and vetiver as its base notes. Gaby Wilson of MTV noted that the ingredients introduced a lighter scent than her previous releases. According to Beyoncé's official perfume website, the fragrance is [...] "paying tribute to Beyoncé's amazing momentous journey" [...] and further [...] "transport you into Beyoncé's world and the intensity of her shows. [...] will make you feel the power, passion and playfulness she gives to her fans." [...] It was also meant to celebrate Beyoncé's accomplishments and her [...] "historic life journey". Gregory DelliCarpini Jr. of Billboard magazine described the scent of the fragrance as [...] "strong and feminine". Holly Carter of People magazine noted that the scent was [...] "the best-smelling alternative" [...] for people who missed The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour.|$|E
500|$|The Southern Rhodesian {{electoral system}} allowed {{only those who}} met certain {{financial}} and educational qualifications to vote. The criteria were applied equally to all regardless of race, but since most Black citizens {{did not meet the}} set standards, the electoral roll and the colonial parliament were overwhelmingly White. Smith canvassed around the geographically very large Selukwe constituency and quickly won considerable popularity. Many White families were receptive to him because of their respect for his father, or because they had had children at school with him. His RAF service also helped, particularly as the local United Party candidate, Petrus Cilliers, had been interned during the hostilities for opposing the war effort. On 15 September 1948, Smith defeated Cilliers and the Labour candidate Egon Klifborg with 361 votes out of 747, and thereby became Member of Parliament for Selukwe. At 29 years old, he was the youngest MP in Southern Rhodesian history. The Liberals, however, were roundly defeated, going from 12 seats before the election to only five afterwards. Smit, who had lost his seat in Salisbury City, retired and was replaced as Leader of the Opposition by Raymond Stockil, who renamed the Liberals the Rhodesia Party. Having grown up in an area of Cape Town so pro-Smuts that she had never had to vote, Janet did not think her husband's entry to parliament would alter their lives at all. [...] "First <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> was marrying a farmer," [...] she later said, [...] "now {{he was going to be}} a politician as well. So I said, 'Well, if you are really interested in it, carry on.'...It never dawned on me—being so naive about politicians—that our lives would be affected in the slightest degree." ...|$|E
