5|$|On {{his way out}} of town, Rick {{stops by}} the legless zombie. He apologizes for what {{happened}} to her and shoots her. Later, he is forced to abandon his car when he runs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas,</b> continuing {{the rest of the way}} on horseback. When he radios Morgan the next day, his signal is picked up by a survivors' camp where Shane, Rick's wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies), and his son Carl (Chandler Riggs) are safe. Unaware that it is Rick on the other line, they lose radio signal before they can warn him of the dangers in Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Azamat {{abandons}} Borat, {{taking his}} passport, {{all of their}} money, and their bear (whose head is later seen inside Azamat's motel refrigerator). Borat's truck runs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas,</b> and he begins to hitchhike to California. He is soon picked up by drunken fraternity brothers from the University of South Carolina. On learning {{the reason for his}} trip, they show him the Pam and Tommy sex tape, revealing that she is not the virgin he thought she was. After leaving the three students, Borat becomes despondent, burning the Baywatch booklet and, by mistake, his return ticket to Kazakhstan. He is also about to slaughter his pet hen, but then changes his mind and lets it go.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Canada, Smith and Mulder's car runs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas.</b> Walking {{the last}} few miles on foot, they come across the corpse of the electrician, grossly {{decomposed}} and covered in ants. Jeremiah takes Mulder to a mysterious field where they find a group of identical children; the girls all resemble Samantha at the age when she was abducted. Jeremiah tells Mulder that the cloned children are drones, workers used to tend the fields, incapable of speaking. After retrieving a gasoline can, Mulder tries {{to take one of}} the female clones with him. However, the Bounty Hunter arrives and chases them. As he corners them in a large bee hive, the Bounty Hunter is crushed and stung repeatedly in a trap set up by the trio.|$|E
25|$|Brownian {{motion is}} the {{mathematical}} model {{used to describe}} the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid. The gas particle animation, using pink and green particles, illustrates how this behavior results in the spreading <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> (entropy). These events are also described by particle theory.|$|R
50|$|Current theory {{states that}} most galaxies, {{including}} dwarf galaxies, form {{in association with}} dark matter, or from gas that contains metals. However, NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer space probe identified new dwarf galaxies forming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> with low metallicity. These galaxies were located in the Leo Ring, a cloud of hydrogen and helium around two massive galaxies in the constellation Leo.|$|R
50|$|The {{hydrocarbon}} {{dew point}} <b>of</b> a <b>gas</b> is a different concept from the water dew point, the latter being the temperature (at a given pressure) at which water vapor present in a gas mixture will condense <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gas.</b>|$|R
5|$|Continuing north, {{they soon}} run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas,</b> but receive {{help from the}} Aurora Boreanaz, who instructs them to stay at a nearby cabin. The two survive {{the night in the}} cabin and set out on foot the next morning. They finally make it to Santa's workshop, only to find a dark, gloomy factory in a dreary, polluted, lifeless wasteland; Santa a sickly and {{depressed}} old man, the elves all horribly mutated and inbred due to Santa's attempts {{to keep up with the}} increasing gift demands year after year, and the reindeer carnivorous, feral monsters that eat the elves who wander out into the snow to die of exhaustion. Santa suddenly collapses and is too sick to deliver the presents. Brian and Stewie agree to do it, but end up wasting an hour and a half at their first house after the family discover their presence, before discovering they were in the wrong house. Realizing that they will not be able to complete the delivery in time, and understanding firsthand the impossibility of Santa's job, Stewie and Brian abandon the delivery in lieu of another plan.|$|E
5|$|On the way, {{they start}} the car after Meg puts mousetraps {{for the big}} mouse. Soon they are stopped by the survivors, who were looking for food, but the griffins don't have any food {{so they have to}} {{distract}} them. They continue their journey only to find that the car has run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas.</b> The griffins now have to walk to Natick just as they found new home, but Peter thinks that our main journey was Natick as Lois takes an apple and bites it while an old man plays the song. So they once again continue their journey after Lois throws the apple at him. They made to natick, but there is no factory. Stewie yells that they done of their life only to trip and get covered in nuclear waste. Upon the sun lights up and shows the factory is still standing and in perfect condition. Expecting to be able to live off of the snackfood while stewie mutates his arms into tentacles, they establish the town of New Quahog around the factory. Peter proclaims himself mayor, and Joe and Clevemire join him to form a ruling council. One year later, New Quahog has become a fresh new community, complete with houses and wells. Peter has successfully reigned as mayor despite many mistakes, such as giving people jobs picked out of a hat rather than based on the person's skills. However, when Brian points out how New Quahog is a peaceful place with no violence, Peter says that they are completely defenseless finds metal to make guns. Later stewie has transformed into an octopus, when lois tries put stewie on with the pajamas with a trap door on the back, he sprays with ink but misses it. Then he tries to get on the celling only to fall off and lois catch him then says that he getting heavy. Stewie suddenly lays hundreds of eggs. Peter shows and made guns that he uses the pipes from the city's water irrigation system to make guns and other weapons, outraging the citizens.|$|E

25|$|Molecular laser isotope {{separation}} uses an infrared laser directed at UF6, exciting molecules that contain a 235U atom. A second laser frees a fluorine atom, leaving uranium pentafluoride, which then precipitates <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gas.</b>|$|R
60|$|Readers of Mr. Bernard Shaw {{and other}} modern writers may be {{interested}} {{to know that the}} Superman has been found. I found him; he lives in South Croydon. My success will be a great blow to Mr. Shaw, who has been following quite a false scent, and is now looking for the creature in Blackpool; and as for Mr. Wells's notion <b>of</b> generating him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> in a private laboratory, I always thought it doomed to failure. I assure Mr. Wells that the Superman at Croydon was born in the ordinary way, though he himself, of course, is anything but ordinary.|$|R
50|$|The gas {{cylinder}} is mounted under the barrel and {{fitted with a}} gas regulator with three fixed positions. The gas regulator opens corresponding holes to change the amount <b>of</b> expanding propellant <b>gases</b> bled off <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gas</b> cylinder into the atmosphere, thus varying {{the amount of energy}} transferred on to the long-stroke piston.|$|R
25|$|To {{start of}} 2017, Menard survived wrecks in the Daytona 500, and {{brought home a}} 5th place finish after a few cars ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas.</b> The next week at Atlanta, he {{finished}} 25th.|$|E
25|$|The {{ambulance}} maintenance issue made national headlines on August 12, 2013, when a DCFEMS ambulance {{that was}} part of President Barack Obama's motorcade ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> on the South Lawn of the White House. EMS personnel said they reported a broken fuel gauge months ago, while DCFEMS said workers failed to fill the vehicle with gasoline.|$|E
25|$|In the {{wildcard}} phase, the Tigers {{eliminated the}} Talk 'N Text Phone Pals and Air21 Express {{to get into}} the quarterfinals, the lowest-seed to do so. In the quarterfinals, the Tigers ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> as the Alaska Aces swept them in the best-of-3 series, partly due to overfatigue {{on the part of the}} Tigers.|$|E
50|$|Afterwards the Sonderkommando {{moved the}} bodies <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gas</b> chamber, removed gold fillings, false teeth, hair, {{jewellery}} and spectacles, and disposed of the corpses, at first in mass graves, later in furnaces and fire pits. Then they cleaned {{the gas chamber}} for the next arrivals.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, East Timor {{launched}} a {{case at the}} Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague to pull <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a <b>gas</b> treaty that it had signed with Australia as it accuses the latter of having ASIS bug the East Timorese cabinet room in Dili in 2004.|$|R
50|$|On 20 July, {{government}} forces pushed ISIS <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gas</b> field and secured it, while fighting continued on its outskirts. According to another source, the Islamic State {{was still in}} control <b>of</b> the <b>gas</b> field, despite efforts of the Army. The next day, new government reinforcements arrived at Tiyas airbase, east of Homs city, while more fighting left six soldiers dead.|$|R
25|$|On 9 August 2008 Franchitti won {{his first}} career Nationwide pole at Watkins Glen. Starting {{alongside}} Robby Gordon, Franchitti led 13 laps and came close to the win.

25|$|Harvick won {{his fourth}} {{race of the}} year at the Phoenix race, taking the lead at the white flag when Carl Edwards ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas.</b> His tenure at RCR came to an end the {{following}} week at Homestead-Miami with a 10th-place finish. Harvick finished the season third in points, with 4 wins, nine Top 5's, 21 Top 10 finishes, and 1 pole position.|$|E
25|$|Diver {{propulsion}} vehicles, or Scooters, {{are sometimes}} used {{to extend the}} range by reducing the work load on the diver and allowing faster travel in open sections of cave. Reliability of the diver propulsion vehicle is very important, as a failure could compromise {{the ability of the}} diver to exit the cave before running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas.</b> Where this is a significant risk, divers may tow a spare scooter.|$|E
25|$|Running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{breathing}} <b>gas</b> {{most commonly}} happens {{as a result}} <b>of</b> poor <b>gas</b> management. It can also happen due to unforeseen exertion or breathing equipment failure. Equipment failure resulting in the loss <b>of</b> all <b>gas</b> could be caused by failure of a pressure retaining component such as an O-ring or hose in the regulator or, in cold conditions, a freezing {{of water in the}} regulator resulting in a free flow from the demand valve.|$|R
50|$|In November 2008, Pickens {{changed his}} {{position}} stating {{that he wants}} heavy trucks, not cars running on natural gas.Rich Kolodziej, President of NGVAmerica, says the very limited distribution network for natural gas is currently available in only 1,200 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 190,000 <b>gas</b> stations would better serve commercial fleets and long-haul trucks.|$|R
50|$|Consequently, this is {{the reason}} why the school, post office moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> town, the <b>gas</b> station closed down and why many of the towns people moved out.|$|R
25|$|Once an Accident, <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gas,</b> or Flat Tire hazard {{has been}} played, and the {{appropriate}} remedy card played to correct it, the player must next play a Roll card {{in order to get}} moving again. A hazard can be played onto an opponent's battle area even if another one is already showing, but only the topmost hazard needs to be corrected before that player can use a Roll card. Playing a Roll against a Stop hazard corrects it and allows the player to start moving; a second Roll is not needed.|$|E
25|$|It was 21 {{years before}} the Greys again made it as far in the playoffs. In 1960-61, they {{finished}} first in the Central Junior B Hockey League and rolled to the championship by defeating the Hamilton Bees and the Siskins, avenging the 1940 loss. Owen Sound then eliminated the St. Marys Lincolns in a semifinal series but ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> in the Sutherland Cup final against the St. Michael's Buzzers, losing in four straight games. To this day, the Greys have never {{made it back to}} the Sutherland Cup final.|$|E
25|$|Biryukova {{says her}} son woke up sick in their Redmond {{apartment}} {{on the morning of}} November 6. She put him and his sister in the car she was driving at the time, a silver 1998 two-door Acura Integra, and headed for Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue. She later stated that around the 2600 block of 112th Street N.E. in that city, a long undeveloped section of the road that follows a tall concrete noise barrier around the curve of the Washington State Route 520 expressway, just west of its interchange with Interstate 405, she ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E
50|$|On July 6, 1988 Occidental's Piper Alpha {{offshore}} {{production platform}} in the UK North Sea was destroyed when an <b>out</b> <b>of</b> service <b>gas</b> condensate pump was started with its {{pressure safety valve}} removed.

25|$|Busch's No. 51 {{was parked}} on lap 99 by NASCAR after Busch drove away from track workers that were tending to his car, which had run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> and crashed {{on the back}} straightaway after being {{accident}}ally spun out by Jamie McMurray. He had been leading the race before the accident and soon the medical assistance arrived. Busch exited the car but realized that his fuel tank was not completely empty and tried to drive it to the garage for repairs. As a medical bag was dragged with the car and slipped off NASCAR ordered Kurt to stop his car for the medical assistance but Busch did not put his helmet back on after he exited the car and could not hear any orders over the radio. His car ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> just in turn 4 and NASCAR officials picked him up and parked the No. 51 team {{for the remainder of}} the race. Busch said goodbye to his team members since he was to drive the No. 78 car for a multi-year deal after the race and when asked about the incident, Busch said that he ignored the order because he did not have his helmet on and could not hear his crew chief's order to stop. NASCAR investigation that week proved that this appeal was true and therefore they did not penalize Busch any further after the parking.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 at Phoenix, Harvick led {{part of the}} race, battling former rival Kyle Busch, but Denny Hamlin led {{the rest}} of the race on the last pit stop. Harvick tried to close on Hamlin, but scored a second-place finish after he ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> with two laps to go, leaving Hamlin the race winner. He managed to cross the finish line holding off the pack for second place. Although winless, Harvick made the Chase through consistency. At the second stop at Phoenix, Harvick avoided a chaos filled race to collect his only win of the season, and the 19th of his career.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, the No. 55 {{was again}} split. This time Waltrip would race 3 times under the No. 55 team, Martin would race 24 more times, and Vickers would race 9 times. In 2013, the No. 55 got its third NASCAR Sprint Cup victory at Loudon with Vickers driving. In the final laps, Vickers stole the lead from Tony Stewart {{and after a}} debris caution fought Stewart for the lead, ending with Stewart running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> in turn 3 just before the white flag; locking up the victory for Vickers. On August 13, it was {{announced}} that Vickers would run the No. 55 full-time in 2014 and 2015.|$|E
