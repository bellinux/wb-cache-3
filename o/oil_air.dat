In order to learn the entrainment mechanism of annular flow in OAL pipe, both experiment adopted observational method and numerical simulation used Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) were carried out. The pipe diameter is 4 mm and Volume of Fluid (VOF) model was used for two phase flow in simulation. The results shows that: it is a wave-annular flow in OAL pipe, and the oil wave in pipe is affected by air, when air velocity is low, the wave is clearly and regularly, but when air velocity increases, the wave become turbulent. When oil or air flow rate increases, the shear stress of pipe wall will be increased, the wave height will be increased as air velocity increases...|$|E

The models were derived from real data of temperature measurements obtained from two industrial power installations. A comparison of the proposed techniques is presented for predicting top and bottom-oil temperatures based on the historical data measured over a 35 day period for the first transformer and 4. 5 days for the second transformer with either a half or a quarter hour sampling time. Comparisons of the results obtained indicate that the hybrid neuro-fuzzy network is the best candidate for the analysis and prediction of the power transformer top and bottom-oil temperatures.

Objectives of this project is {{to design and fabricate}} the mould for tensile test specimen, following ASTM E 8 standard and to study the mechanical properties of the casted materials and its comparison with effect of the cooling rate between water, <b>oil</b> and <b>air.</b> Materials that have been used for mould is mild steel and for casted material is aluminum alloy. Overall, this project was run based on four main steps; design using Solid Work, running a simulation on Master CAM, fabricated using CNC Milling Machine, and finally casting process. Each sample was then tested by Rockwell hardness in order to study the effect of the cooling media to the hardness of casted material for all three cooling media, water, <b>oil</b> and <b>air.</b> It project was done by testing at the outer surface and inner surface of the casted aluminum alloys. The higher value for outer surface hardness test is 49. 10 HRB and the higher value for inner surface hardness test is 37. 72 HRB. The result shows the hardness of casted material immersed in water has higher value compared to <b>oil</b> and <b>air.</b> Water has proved to be the best mediums for cooling rate compare to <b>oil</b> and <b>air</b> medium.
