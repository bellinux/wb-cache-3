5|$|Oxy-fuel welding – {{also known}} as <b>oxyacetylene</b> welding or oxy welding, uses fuel gases and oxygen to weld and cut metals.|$|E
5|$|Despite Gormley's plea, {{removal of}} B of the Bang began in April 2009. More {{substantial}} hoarding was erected around {{the site and}} demolition firm Connell Brothers Limited began removing the spikes with <b>oxyacetylene</b> cutting equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} gas welding process is oxyfuel welding, {{also known as}} <b>oxyacetylene</b> welding. It {{is one of the}} oldest and most {{versatile}} welding processes, but in recent years it has become less popular in industrial applications. It is still widely used for welding pipes and tubes, as well as repair work.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the battle, two of Von der Tanns main turrets were knocked out by British gunfire, while her other two turrets {{suffered}} mechanical failures. The ship was firing so fast that several of the main guns in the amidships turrets became overheated and jammed in their recoil slides, and could not be returned to working order. Von der Tann was without her main battery for 11hours, although three turrets were restored to working order {{before the end of the}} battle; Dturret only after much cutting away of bent metal with <b>oxyacetylene</b> torches—afterwards the guns could be worked only by hand. Her casualties amounted to 11 dead and 35 wounded. During the battle Von der Tann fired 170 heavy shells and 98 secondary caliber shells.|$|E
5|$|Though the Admiralty {{arranged}} {{for some of}} the ships to be salvaged, most were left {{at the bottom of the}} sound until entrepreneur Ernest Cox bought the salvage rights and began to raise the remaining ships in the early 1920s. Bremse presented particular challenges. She had come to rest perched precariously on a rock, which sloped away dramatically, causing fears that she might slip off and sink in deeper water. Cox's salvage team sealed her bulkheads and divided the hull into watertight compartments. The hull was patched up and an airlock fitted, but the team ran into difficulties with the large amount of oil which covered the wreck, more than had been found in any other of the ships salvaged previously. A three-man team using <b>oxyacetylene</b> torches ignited some oil, causing an explosion. The men escaped without serious injuries, and thereafter small explosions and fires were common over the two months it took to prepare the ship, though no one was injured.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 2000, {{the part}} of the {{radiation}} therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors, who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale. They took it home, planning to dismantle it later. On 1 February, the two, together with another two associates, attempted to dismantle the metal part (a 97-kilogram, 42-by-20-centimetre lead cylinder held in a stainless steel casing), which was the unit's source drawer. Using a hammer and chisel, they only managed to crack the welded seam. Two of the men then took the metal piece, along with other scrap metal, to a scrapyard on Soi Wat Mahawong in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province. There they asked a worker at the scrapyard to cut open the cylinder using an <b>oxyacetylene</b> torch. As the cylinder was cut open, two smaller cylindrical metal pieces, which had held the source capsule, fell out. The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the scrapyard, but was unaware of the source capsule itself. The lead cylinder was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the disassembly.|$|E
25|$|Welding lead or 'lead burning' {{was much}} {{more common in the}} 19th century to make some pipe {{connections}} and tanks. Great skill is required but can be quickly learned. In building construction today some lead flashing is welded but soldered copper flashing is much more common in America. In the automotive body collision industry before the 1980s, <b>oxyacetylene</b> gas torch welding was seldom used to weld sheetmetal, since warpage was a byproduct besides the excess heat. Automotive body repair methods at the time were crude and yielded improprieties until MIG welding became the industry standard. Since the 1970s, when high strength steel became the standard for automotive manufacturing, electric welding became the preferred method. After the 1980s, the <b>oxyacetylene</b> torch fell out of use for sheetmetal welding in the industrialized world.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} war, the British used the tunnels: {{soon after the}} Liberation of the Channel Islands, some {{military}} equipment was moved and stored in the tunnels. For example, Ho1 stored weapons, Ho2 stored small equipment such as helmets, gas masks, fuel, <b>oxyacetylene,</b> and field kitchens. Ho13 stored Panzer Abteilung 213's Char B1 bis tanks.|$|E
25|$|An {{issue in}} the twenty-first century is the thermal lance. Burning iron rods in pure oxygen ignited by an <b>oxyacetylene</b> torch, it can produce {{temperatures}} of 6,600–8,000°F (3,650–4,430°C). The thermal lance user bores a series of small holes that can eventually be linked to form a gap. Vault manufacturers work closely with the banking industry and law enforcement in order to keep up with such advances in burglary.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the melted}} metal flows {{out of the}} workpiece, there must be room on the {{opposite}} side of the workpiece for the spray to exit. When possible, pieces of metal are cut on a grate that lets the melted metal fall freely to the ground. The same equipment can be used for <b>oxyacetylene</b> blowtorches and welding torches, by exchanging the part of the torch in front of the torch valves.|$|E
25|$|Overnight on 23 January, gunmen set off {{a number}} of explosions along the wall near the crossing. Palestinians packed into cars and donkey carts, crossed the border into Egypt from Gaza on foot, to buy {{essential}} goods. Between 200,000 and 700,000 Palestinians crossed over to Egypt and bought items at shops at the Egyptian half of Rafah and the North Sinai Governorate's capital, Arish. A Palestinian security guard later told The Times of London that militants had been steadily cutting through {{the base of the}} Israeli Gaza Strip barrier with <b>oxyacetylene</b> torches for months.|$|E
25|$|U-570 {{was placed}} in a dry-dock in the Vickers {{shipyard}} in Barrow. Her repair was complicated by depth-charge damage to her bow—her plating had been buckled, trapping four electrically powered torpedoes in their torpedo tubes. Two officers from the Royal Navy's Department of Torpedoes and Mines Investigations had the task of retrieving them for examination. The dock was evacuated while a volunteer shipyard worker cut the armed torpedoes free with an <b>oxyacetylene</b> cutter under the officers' supervision. One of the officers—Lt Martin Johnson—then removed the magnetic pistols (detonators) from the torpedoes and made them safe—a dangerous task as the pistols were sensitive mechanisms and large enough to produce a lethal explosion on their own. For this act he was awarded the George Medal on 8 December 1942.|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{remaining}} 20% of commercially produced oxygen is used in medical applications, metal cutting and welding, as an oxidizer in rocket fuel, and in water treatment. Oxygen is used in <b>oxyacetylene</b> welding burning acetylene with [...] to produce a very hot flame. In this process, metal up to [...] thick is first heated with a small oxy-acetylene flame and then quickly cut by a large stream of [...]|$|E
500|$|In 1891 Scottish chemist James Dewar {{was able}} to produce enough liquid oxygen for study. The first commercially viable process for {{producing}} liquid oxygen was independently developed in 1895 by German engineer Carl von Linde and British engineer William Hampson. Both men lowered the temperature of air until it liquefied and then distilled the component gases by boiling them off {{one at a time}} and capturing them separately. Later, in 1901, <b>oxyacetylene</b> welding was demonstrated for the first time by burning a mixture of acetylene and compressed [...] This method of welding and cutting metal later became common.|$|E
500|$|The {{heat-affected zone}} (HAZ) is a ring {{surrounding}} the weld {{in which the}} temperature of the welding process, combined with the stresses of uneven heating and cooling, alter the heat-treatment properties of the alloy. The effects of welding on the material surrounding the weld can be detrimental—depending on the materials used and the heat input of the welding process used, the HAZ can be of varying size and strength. The thermal diffusivity of the base material plays a large role—if the diffusivity is high, the material cooling rate is high and the HAZ is relatively small. Conversely, a low diffusivity leads to slower cooling and a larger HAZ. The amount of heat injected by the welding process plays an important role as well, as processes like <b>oxyacetylene</b> welding have an unconcentrated heat input and increase the size of the HAZ. Processes like laser beam welding give a highly concentrated, limited amount of heat, resulting in a small HAZ. Arc welding falls between these two extremes, with the individual processes varying somewhat in heat input. To calculate the heat input for arc welding procedures, the following formula can be used: ...|$|E

2500|$|Approximately 20% of {{acetylene}} {{is supplied}} by the industrial gases industry for <b>oxyacetylene</b> gas welding and cutting due to the high temperature of the flame. Combustion of acetylene with oxygen produces a flame of over , releasing 11.8kJ/g. <b>Oxyacetylene</b> is the hottest burning common fuel gas. [...] Acetylene is the third-hottest natural chemical flame after dicyanoacetylene's [...] and cyanogen at [...] Oxy-acetylene welding was a popular welding process in previous decades. The development and advantages of arc-based welding processes have made oxy-fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications. Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly. On the other hand, oxy-acetylene welding equipment is quite versatile – {{not only because the}} torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding (as in certain artistic applications), but also because it lends itself easily to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and other applications. Bell Canada cable repair technicians still use portable acetylene fuelled torch kits as a soldering tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in manholes and in some aerial locations. <b>Oxyacetylene</b> welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible. As well, oxy-fuel cutting is still popular and oxy-acetylene cutting is utilized in many metal fabrication shops. For use in welding and cutting, the working pressures must be controlled by a regulator, since above 15 psi, if subjected to a shockwave (caused for example by a flashback), acetylene decomposes explosively into hydrogen and carbon.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the act is}} {{not very}} well known outside the {{crossover}} scene, Cubanate had a brief vogue in heavy metal circles. The band toured with acts such as Fear Factory, The Sisters of Mercy, Rammstein, Carcass and other rock acts, whilst Body Burn and <b>Oxyacetylene</b> were both Single of the Week in UK rock weekly Kerrang! {{and a number of}} early nu metal acts [...] have cited Cubanate as an influence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second album}} Cyberia (1994) spawned the hit single <b>Oxyacetylene,</b> {{generally}} considered Cubanate's creative peak. [...] For live {{work around the}} Cyberia tour the band hired Shep Ashton on guitar and Darren Bennett on keyboards. After '96 Ashton and Bennett were replaced by Roddy Stone (currently fronting UK metal act Viking Skull) and David Bianchi (who later {{went on to become}} manager of rock bands The Enemy and Boy Kill Boy).|$|E
2500|$|On an <b>oxyacetylene</b> torch system {{there will}} be three types of valves, the tank valve, the {{regulator}} valve, and the torch valve. There will be a set of these three valves for each gas. The gas in the tanks or cylinders is at high pressure. Oxygen cylinders are generally filled to approximately 2200 psi. The regulator converts the high pressure gas to a low pressure stream suitable for welding. [...] Acetylene cylinders must be maintained in an upright position to prevent the internal acetone and acetylene from separating in the filler material.|$|E

2500|$|On December 3, 1956, Bush Terminal was {{the site}} {{of what might have been}} the largest {{explosion}} in New York City history. Dockworkers were using an <b>oxyacetylene</b> torch to perform routine maintenance work when sparks ignited 26,365 pounds of ground foam rubber scrap. Employees abandoned initial efforts to control the blaze; 26 minutes later, the fire reached 37,000 pounds of Cordeau Detonant Fuse, setting off an explosion. The blast resulted in 10 deaths, 270 injuries, [...] "major destruction" [...] in a 1,000-foot radius, and broken windows a mile around. People 35 miles away reported hearing it.

60|$|Their ample {{discussion}} of {{every detail of}} the cigar-lighter led them to speak of electric flat-irons and bed-warmers. Babbitt apologized for being so shabbily old-fashioned as still to use a hot-water bottle, and he announced that he would have the sleeping-porch wired at once. He had enormous and poetic admiration, though very little understanding, of all mechanical devices. They were his symbols of truth and beauty. Regarding each new intricate mechanism--metal lathe, two-jet carburetor, machine gun, <b>oxyacetylene</b> welder--he learned one good realistic-sounding phrase, and used it over and over, with a delightful feeling of being technical and initiated.|$|E
