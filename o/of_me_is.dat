Aguilera sings [...] "Now that I'm wiser/ Now that I'm stronger/ Now that I'm a fighter/ There's a thousand faces on me" [...] over a [...] "thumping" [...] beat, and belts the line [...] "We're gonna rise up for every time you broke me" [...] on the chorus.|$|E

500|$|Zeta-Jones' career graph and {{marriage}} to Douglas {{has been a}} subject of satire. A 2006 episode of the satirical British television show Star Stories (2006–2008) was entitled Catherine Zeta-Jones— Her Quest to Prove Herself... And Also Find Love, about a fictitious life story of Zeta-Jones. Addressing her perceived media image, Zeta-Jones remarked in a 2004 interview to USA Weekend: [...] "The biggest misconception <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> that I'm some die-hard, ambitious, do-anything-to-get-anything kind of person, I'm not. I'm very shy socially." [...] Zeta-Jones is protective of her public image, {{and the use of}} her likeness is carefully controlled. As well as taking legal action against Hello! magazine, she sued a Nevada-based topless club for including her image on their advertising. In 2003, the celebrity biographer Cliff Goodwin wrote an unauthorised biography of the actress, entitled Catherine Zeta Jones: The Biography, but the publication was indefinitely postponed when she issued a legal notice prohibiting its release.|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by singer Plácido Domingo, Verstappen expressed delight about a [...] "great race", crediting his team with {{giving him a}} good car. Kimi Räikkönen said {{that while he was}} happy for Verstappen, he was disappointed not to have won. He blamed the lack of downforce while following as the reason why he had been unable to pass Verstappen. Vettel congratulated the winner as well, but lamented that his different strategy had not worked out in his favour. During the post-race press conference, Räikkönen stressed that had anyone offered the team two podium positions after their poor performance in qualifying, they would have taken it [...] "happily". Fourth placed Ricciardo expressed bitterness over Red Bull's decision to switch him to a three-stop strategy, which eventually lost him a podium position, saying: [...] "I'm a bit devastated. A big part <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> happy the team are on winning form but it's hard to celebrate". His team later explained their decision, declaring that they had focused their strategy on Vettel, who they had considered the biggest threat.|$|E

500|$|There are {{important}} locations featured in Air {{that are based}} on places in the city Kami in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. Air is set in the Kasumi district of Kami; {{during the course of the}} series' creation, Kasumi was an individual town that has since merged with two others to form the city of Kami. Many of the locales in Air, such as the seawall, the train station, the shrine, and the school are based on real places. As Air is set in the middle of summer, the season offers bright, sunny skies for the town during the day.Translated quote: [...] "In front <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> an unchecked, wide open sky. No obscuring objects whatsoever. The sunlight oscillated down." [...] In the manga adaptation, the town is described as a [...] "quiet town with few people...with nothing but beaches and countryside." [...] Scenario assistant Yūichi Suzumoto has commented that his impression of Air is similar to that of a folk song due to the rural setting and heartwarming story progression.|$|E
500|$|The apocalyptic wartime {{setting and}} the climactic moment when Jim sees the distant white flash {{of the atomic}} bombing of Nagasaki gave Spielberg {{powerful}} visual metaphors [...] "to draw a parallel story between the death of this boy's innocence {{and the death of}} the innocence of the entire world." [...] Spielberg reflected he [...] "was attracted to the idea that this was a death of innocence, not an attenuation of childhood, which by my own admission and everybody's impression <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> what my life has been. This was the opposite of Peter Pan. This was a boy who had grown up too quickly." [...] Other topics that Spielberg previously dealt with, and are presented in Empire of the Sun, include a child being separated from his parents (The Sugarland Express, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Poltergeist) and World War II (1941, and Raiders of the Lost Ark). Spielberg explained [...] "My parents got a divorce when I was 14, 15. The whole thing about separation is something that runs very deep in anyone exposed to divorce." ...|$|E
500|$|At 8:32a.m. {{local time}} {{the next day}} (18 May), an {{earthquake}} measuring magnitude 5.1 rocked the area, triggering the landslide that started the main eruption. In a matter of seconds, vibrations from the earthquake loosened [...] of rock on the mountain's north face and summit, creating a massive landslide. With {{the loss of the}} confining pressure of the overlying rock, Mount St. Helens began to rapidly emit steam and other volcanic gases. A few seconds later, it erupted laterally, sending swift pyroclastic flows down its flanks at near supersonic speeds. These flows were later joined by lahars. Before being struck by a series of flows that, at their fastest, would have taken less than a minute to reach his position, Johnston managed to radio his USGS co-workers with the message: [...] "Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!" [...] Seconds later, the signal from the radio went silent, and all contact with the geologist was lost. Initially, there was some debate as to whether Johnston had survived; records soon showed a radio message from fellow eruption victim and amateur radio operator Gerry Martin, located near the Coldwater peak and farther north of Johnston's position, reporting his sighting of the eruption enveloping the ColdwaterII observation post. As the blast overwhelmed Johnston's post, Martin declared solemnly, [...] "Gentlemen, the uh... camper and the car sitting over to the south <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> covered. It's gonna get me, too. I can't get out of here..." [...] before his radio went silent.|$|E

2500|$|Chapman {{remained}} at the scene, appearing to be reading The Catcher in the Rye, until the police arrived. The police officers who first responded, recognizing that Lennon's wounds were severe, decided not to wait for an ambulance and rushed him to Roosevelt Hospital in a squad car. Chapman was arrested without incident. In his statement to police three hours later, Chapman stated, [...] "I’m sure the big part <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> Holden Caulfield, who is the main person in the book. The small part of me must be the Devil." [...] Lennon was pronounced dead by Dr. Stephan Lynn at 11:07p.m. at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.|$|E

Maybe I'll be totally depressed and write another really dark album. I have no idea where I'm going to go. All I know is that I'm just always going to try to grow and do my best.

2500|$|In March 2013, CKMP's {{morning show}} held a stunt contest {{entitled}} Bank It or Burn It, in which listeners {{were asked to}} vote via social media on whether $5,000 in cash would be saved, or burned in an incinerator. If a majority of listeners voted to save the money, those who voted in favor would be entered into a contest with the money as a prize. Ultimately, 54% of viewers voted in favour of burning the money, which was presented in a video set to Ellie Goulding's song [...] "Burn". Reaction to the stunt was negative; local charities complained that the money could have been donated instead of burned (and in turn, encouraged listeners to donate themselves), a listener started a petition demanding that CKMP {{be taken off the}} air, and others questioned the legality of the stunt—however, Canadian law only bans the burning of coins, and not paper currency. Morning show host Katie Summers defended the stunt, stating that [...] "Part <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> glad we burned the money. A week ago, all of the same people and all of the same charities in this city were just as in need. Only now, after an awfully tragic social experiment, are they the forefront of everyone’s mind. Maybe this sparked a conversation we needed to have." [...] In turn, the station announced it would perform a second round of Bank It or Burn It, but with $10,000 instead. This time, listeners voted to save the money; additionally, the station announced that it would donate $10,000 to the Children's Wish Foundation {{in the name of the}} contest's winner.|$|E
