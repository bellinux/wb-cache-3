500|$|Bessie was {{renowned for}} the {{sharpness}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> either {{in pursuit of}} her campaigns or in denouncing her enemies. She frequently used inflammatory, colourful language, once describing an opposing councillor as a [...] "blasted rat", and another time telling the Tory majority that she was willing [...] "to take a machine gun to the lot of you". In contrast to this aggressive public, Bessie's private life was unostentatious. She did not smoke or drink, dressed conventionally and holidayed modestly in Scarborough. Nevertheless, she enjoyed the company of many glamorous friends from the worlds of show business and boxing.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Matt Cibula from PopMatters praised its theme and Shakira's [...] "furious and sexual and self-mocking" [...] vocal delivery, but found the song [...] "strange" [...] and [...] "internally inconsistent". Alexis Petridis from The Guardian complimented the unpredictable {{nature of the}} song, although {{he also noted that}} the lyrics at times suggested a [...] "faltering grasp of English". Edward Oculicz from Stylus Magazine gave it a positive review, calling the song's chorus [...] "bruised" [...] and [...] "anthemic" [...] and the lyrics [...] "impossible for native speakers to emulate". Pam Avoledo from Blogcritics was also positive towards the song, noting improvement in Shakira's vocal delivery and calling them [...] "brassy yet sensitive". Spencer D. from IGN Music felt the highlight to the song was Shakira's spoken bridge, saying that it lets the [...] "light tinges of her accent roll <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> and present her as herself rather than the obvious result of previous pop matrons". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic picked the song as a highlight from the album.|$|E
500|$|On {{his list}} of the ten best albums of 2013, Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly placed Bangerz third, complimenting Cyrus' ability for [...] "cutting-edge rap , a soulful voice capable of showstoppers , and an underappreciated {{emotional}} directness". The Guardian ranked Bangerz thirty-fourth on their list of the forty best albums, commenting that it [...] " [...] people up for commercial, rather than transgressive, ends" [...] despite initially opining that [...] "the attention-seeking begins to grate". Rolling Stone placed Bangerz at number twenty-seven on their list of the fifty best albums, writing that Cyrus [...] " [...] depth and vulnerability to {{one hell of a}} party [...] amid all the foam-finger hub-hub". Ann Powers from NPR ranked the record tenth on her list of ten records, suggesting that it [...] "should earn her entry into every celebration of pop this year", while the Associated Press ranked it ninth for being [...] "banging". Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle listed Bangerz as the fourth-best record of the year, calling it a [...] "fun, feisty pop album that produced two of the year's biggest, best singles" [...] and summarizing that [...] "with one flick <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> Cyrus easily outdoes recent fare from Gaga, Katy and Britney." ...|$|E
60|$|Emp. She's {{all that}} thou canst say, or I can think; But the perverseness <b>of</b> <b>her</b> clamourous <b>tongue</b> Strikes pity deaf.|$|R
60|$|Rose was {{the life}} <b>of</b> the party. <b>Her</b> <b>tongue</b> rattled {{on in the}} most {{delightful}} way.|$|R
60|$|Her cheeks {{burned with}} a fire which seemed to her like the fire <b>of</b> shame. <b>Her</b> <b>tongue</b> seemed hung with sudden weights. She had doubted him. The hideousness <b>of</b> it oppressed <b>her</b> like a nightmare; yet her voice did not falter.|$|R
60|$|Madame la Vicomtesse had {{an answer}} on the tip <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b> I know now that she spared me.|$|E
60|$|Alan made Jeekie {{interpret}} this speech, then answered {{that the reason}} was that he knew but little <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|E
60|$|Hardened by {{a life of}} drudgery, under {{conditions}} of perpetual scolding, the servant stood her ground, and recovered the use <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|E
60|$|She was {{not really}} ill-natured, but, in {{maintaining}} her position after the trying circumstances <b>of</b> <b>her</b> married life, she had found it so necessary to be 'full of information,' that the idea <b>of</b> holding <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> about 'those two' in the Park never occurred to her.|$|R
60|$|He {{reflected}} {{how much}} he had always preferred Marjorie to Daffy. She was brighter--more like him. Daffy was unresponsive, with a touch <b>of</b> bitterness under <b>her</b> <b>tongue....</b>|$|R
60|$|The girl well {{knew this}} goblet {{contained}} a vile poison, one drop <b>of</b> which on <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> would cause death; so she hesitated, trembling and shrinking from the ordeal.|$|R
6000|$|Braced {{against her}} woe, Hunilla would not, durst {{not trust the}} {{weakness}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b> Then when our Captain asked whether any whale-boats had-- ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young woman}} took {{advantage}} of the rhetorical full-stop to dash in with the remark which was already marshalled on the tip <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He'd gaze in her {{orbit of}} blue, Her hand he would tenderly squeeze, But the words <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> {{that he knew}} Were limited {{strictly}} to these: ...|$|E
60|$|Mariposilla {{had never}} before {{addressed}} me in the quaint, affectionate style <b>of</b> <b>her</b> anglicized <b>tongue,</b> and as I caught her in my arms, laughing at the sweet, sober compliment, I told her how I would always treasure it for her sake--the most delightful praise I had ever received.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} to be a surgeon, thank heaven; I intend to make perfect hands and arms, not mend damaged ones," [...] {{retorted}} Psyche, in a dignified tone, somewhat marred by a great piece <b>of</b> court-plaster on <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Celine Dumont," [...] {{she replied}} unhesitatingly, for {{had she not}} rehearsed all this in <b>her</b> mind dozens <b>of</b> times, until <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> could rattle off the {{borrowed}} name as easily as it could her own; [...] "servitor to Citizeness Desiree Candeille!" ...|$|R
60|$|Charlotte's {{cheeks were}} in a flame, and {{something}} vehement at the end <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> when, with a gentle knock, and 'By your favour, ladies,' in walked Mr. Delaford.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Patsy {{was glad}} to see her visitors, {{particularly}} glad, it seemed, to see Mr Croft. She was quite loquacious, considering the great length of her days, and the proverbial shortness <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|E
60|$|Whatever Rosamond {{had on the}} tip <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> was averted by the {{entrance}} of the three younger brothers. Julius seated himself beside her in the cushioned fireside corner; and Cecil asked where Raymond was.|$|E
60|$|The Americans {{had their}} eye upon her, and felt that, though the others might be forbidding English women, this {{one could be}} made to talk. So they pounced upon their prey, to the dismay <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mates, and {{proceeded}} to ask fifty questions to the minute. Poor Mat, glad to hear the sound <b>of</b> <b>her</b> native <b>tongue,</b> fell into the snare, and grew more confiding every moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is a genius!" [...] {{observed}} Staniford at {{his first}} opportunity with Dunham. [...] "I knew {{there must be something}} the matter. Of course she's going out to school her voice; and she hasn't strained it in idle babble about her own affairs! I must say that Lu--Miss Blood's power <b>of</b> holding <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> commands my homage. Was it her little coup to wait till we got into that hopeless hobble before she struck in?" ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{went to the}} {{relatively}} inexperienced Tanya Halesworth who was a presented at the ABC. Director Alan Burke said he saw Portia [...] "as a beautiful debutante, {{the darling of the}} deb set <b>of</b> <b>her</b> day. I wanted a beautiful girl for the role, one with wit, astuteness, vivacity; but one with a little bit <b>of</b> edge to <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b> Tanya has all these." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy that it {{has arrived}} in that poor man's case," [...] thought Mary to herself. Lady Jones, who also knew Mrs. Tomley and the power <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> nodded her head sympathetically and said: ...|$|E
60|$|In {{an instant}} Bathsheba's face {{coloured}} with the angry crimson of a Danby sunset. But she forbore to utter this feeling, and the reticence <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> only made the loquacity {{of her face}} the more noticeable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{the maid}} wedded at once, ere any harm come of it," [...] {{returned}} Perronel promptly. [...] "She {{will make a}} good wife--there will be no complaining <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> and she is well instructed in all good housewifery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now let each sit {{upon her}} luggage and clamour till some one comes and {{examines}} it, else {{it will get}} whisked away heaven only knows where,' ordered Amanda, who was the leader in right <b>of</b> <b>her</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>tongues.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cristian and Vanessa {{are married}} after some advise from family friend Tea Delgado and made {{love for the}} first time. Cristian's girlfriend Sarah Roberts is hurt and upset that Cristian would marry Vanessa and having her be a witness at the wedding. After weeks <b>of</b> holding <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> Sarah tells INS that the {{marriage}} is a sham and later lashes out at Cristian, telling him that she had loved him and that he couldn't wait long enough to hurt her. She tells him that she is leaving Llanview to be a manager for Puddle Of Mudd. Angry and in tears, she leaves Cristian.|$|R
60|$|If Jo {{had only}} known {{what a great}} {{happiness}} was wavering in the balance for one of them, she would have turned dove-like in a minute, but unfortunately, we don't have windows in our breasts, and cannot see {{what goes on in}} the minds of our friends. Better for us that we cannot as a general thing, but now and then it would be such a comfort, such a saving of time and temper. By her next speech, Jo deprived herself of several years of pleasure, and received a timely lesson in the art <b>of</b> holding <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|R
60|$|Before Albinia had {{disarmed}} her reply of {{the irony}} {{on the tip}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> the omnibus came lumbering round the corner, and a voice proceeded from the rear, the door flew open, {{and there was a}} rapid exit.|$|E
60|$|Did this anxiety {{relate to}} Susan? The bare doubt of it decided me. I consented to see Mrs. Rymer. Feeling it {{necessary}} to control her in the use <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> I spoke the moment the door was opened.|$|E
6000|$|... "Boo!" [...] cried Martha, {{and put out}} the tip <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> at him. [...] "Who said I wanted any of {{your old}} cadets!" [...] Then, {{as he and his}} cousins ran for the train, she waved him an affectionate farewell.|$|E
6000|$|And must she {{speak at}} last, rather than die? [...] And must she plead, without another's aid? [...] She must, she must: the vital moments fly [...] She lives--she dies, a passion-wasted maid. [...] At length she bursts all ties <b>of</b> modesty: [...] <b>Her</b> <b>tongue</b> {{explains}} <b>her</b> eyes; {{the words are}} said [...] And she asks pity, underneath that blow [...] Which he, perhaps, that gave it did not know.|$|R
60|$|She was {{not sure}} that Neigh would stand the test <b>of</b> <b>her</b> revelations. It would be {{possible}} to lead him to marry her without revealing anything--the events of the last few days had shown her that--yet Ethelberta's honesty shrank from the safe course <b>of</b> holding <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b> It might be pleasant to many a modern gentleman to find himself allied with a lady, none of whose ancestors had ever pandered to a court, lost an army, taken a bribe, oppressed a community, or broken a bank; but the added disclosure that, in avoiding these stains, her kindred had worked and continued to work with their hands for bread, might lead such an one to consider that the novelty was dearly purchased.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to explore the process {{undergone}} by the protagonist of Stupeur et Tremblement (Fear and trembling) by Amélie Nothomb. As this process is believed to be a dialogue between cultures, a Bakhtinian approach has been taken to illuminate its development towards a final understanding. In addition, the multiple sites of conflict and identity negotiation in the data are analyzed following Pavlenko’s main aspects of identity negotiation (2001 b). One of the peculiarities about Amèlie Nothomb is that she considers Japanese and French as two ‘varieties’ <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mother <b>tongue,</b> although all <b>her</b> novels are written in French...|$|R
