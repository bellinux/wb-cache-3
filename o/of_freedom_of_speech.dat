In a speech during a Dutch parliamentary debate, Wilders elaborated that he calls for the consistent application of Dutch laws restricting any act of expression that incites violence.

Robyn Blumner of the St. Petersburg Times wrote that Lewis aptly summarized {{the development of the}} U.S. Constitution's protections <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> and of the press.

50|$|The National Assembly had {{imposed a}} {{sentence}} of fifteen days' suspension without any prospect of the discharge contemplated in the rules of Parliament. The punishment imposed on the first applicant was for statements she had made in the Assembly in the exercise <b>of</b> her <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech,</b> protected by the Constitution. The punishment of suspension was not authorised by the rules <b>of</b> Parliament. The <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> conferred by section 58(1) of the Constitution is an absolute freedom {{in the sense that}} it is subject only to the rules and orders of the Assembly. It is not subject to the limitations clause of the Constitution.

5|$|The First Amendment {{guarantees}} the rights <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> and peaceable assembly, among others.

These protections not only prohibit the government from passing laws which infringe upon these rights, but also from taking actions which would violate them. While the Bill of Rights—which includes the First Amendment—applied originally only to the federal government, the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed for the application of the Bill of Rights to the states under the incorporation doctrine.|$|E
5|$|The Smith Act {{trials of}} Communist Party leaders were {{a series of}} federal prosecutions {{conducted}} from 1949 to 1958 in which leaders of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) were accused of violating the Smith Act, a statute which imposed penalties on those who advocated violent overthrow of the government. The prosecution argued that the CPUSA's policies promoted violent revolution; the defendants countered that they advocated a peaceful transition to socialism, and that the First Amendment's guarantee <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> and of association protected their membership of a political party. The trials led to the US Supreme Court decisions Dennis v. United States (1951) and Yates v. United States (1957).|$|E

A three-judge panel of a U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia agreed that three of the laws were unconstitutional, but reserved judgment on the other two laws pending interpretation by state courts (which had not yet ruled on the laws' legality). Both the state and the NAACP appealed. In Harrison v. NAACP, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-to-3 that the district court should have withheld judgment until state courts had considered the issue first.|$|E
