50|$|Recognition in HFA {{individuals}} {{has been}} widely studied. Overall, these studies conclude {{that the majority of}} HFA individuals have intact recognition ability. Non-social stimuli recognition is often superior, or “robustly intact”, although there is some evidence suggesting that HFA individuals have difficulty with complex scenes and color combinations. For example, HFA individuals exhibit intact recognition of non-social stimuli such as written words, spoken sentences, pictures of common objects, and meaningless patterns or shapes. For HFA individuals impaired recognition have been found in object-location and <b>object-color</b> recognition tests, and recognition of words encoded self-referentially.

40|$|An {{optimization}} {{program was}} written {{to determine a}} set of channel responses for measuring <b>object-color</b> spectra. The program incorporated the Complex method of optimization to search the feasible space. The optimum set was determined based upon minimization {{of the number of}} channels, the average color difference (AE*ab) over a set of 116 colors and three illuminants, and the average reflectance factor difference between the actual and estimated spectra. It was expected that {{it would be possible to}} identify a system which would fall between current spectrophotometers and the ideal but unrealizable system whose responses are the three CIE standard color-matching functions weighted by the three illuminants. It was found that even with as few as six channels, each a gaussian with specific mean and bandwidth, reasonable performance could be attained...|$|E
40|$|Object files play {{important}} roles in visual cognition, {{one of which is}} feature integration. However, their internal structure remains unknown. The current study investigated how multiple features of an <b>object—color</b> and shape—are integrated using a modified object-reviewing paradigm. In particular, we tested whether independent features or color-shape conjunction are bound to the file. A preview of two-colored objects was followed by a linking display. Then, a target was presented to judge whether the target contains any feature of the previews, regardless of their locations. Conditions in which both color and shape are matched with different corresponding preview locations were compared. If features are independently bound, facilitation in response time (RT) will increase additively as the number of location-shared features. If features are bundled, the RT facilitation occurs only when both features share the location. A series of experiments different in stimuli, the number of placeholders, and object motion showed different patterns of mean RT, but RT distribution analysis indicated that estimated nondecision time is consistent with the feature bundle hypothesis. The conjunction-based object preview benefit suggests that in object file formation, color and shape form a perceptual unit, and the unit is kept through object motion...|$|E
40|$|Doubts {{have been}} cast on the strict {{dissociation}} between short- and long-term memory systems. Specifically, several neuroimaging {{studies have shown}} that the medial temporal lobe, a region almost invariably associated with long-term memory, is involved in active short-term memory maintenance. Furthermore, a recent study in hippocampally lesioned patients has shown that the hippocampus is critically involved in associating objects and their locations, even when the delay period lasts only 8 s. However, the critical feature that causes the medial temporal lobe, and in particular the hippocampus, to participate in active maintenance is still unknown. This study was designed in order to explore hippocampal involvement in active maintenance of spatial and non-spatial associations. Eighteen participants performed a delayed-match-to-sample task in which they had to maintain either object-location associations, color-number association, single colors, or single locations. Whole-brain activity was measured using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and analyzed using a random effects model. Right lateralized hippocampal activity was evident when participants had to maintain object-location associations, but not when they had to maintain <b>object-color</b> associations or single items. The present results suggest a hippocampal involvement in active maintenance when feature combinations that include spatial information have to be maintained online...|$|E
40|$|In {{everyday}} life, {{our actions}} are often guided by verbal instructions. Usually, we can implement such instructions immediately without {{trial and error}} learning. This raises the fundamental question how verbal instructions are transformed into efficient motor behavior. The {{aim of this study}} was to gain deeper insights into the implementation of verbal instructions both on a neural and a cognitive level. To this end, we devised an fMRI experiment in which participants were required to permanently implement new stimulus-response (S-R) mappings and <b>object-color</b> (O-C) mappings. This enabled us to test whether there are brain areas that are specific to the implementation of newly instructed S-R mappings or whether newly instructed rules are represented independently from the specific content. Furthermore, we could test which brain areas are involved in the processing of S-R mappings when compared with O-C mappings. Our results suggest that only one brain area, the left inferior frontal junction (IFJ), was sensitive to the novelty of instructions regardless of whether these instructions conveyed S-R or O-C mappings. Furthermore, our results show that instructions conveying S-R mapping involve a network of brain areas, including pre-PMd, M 1, and IPS that was not sensitive to the novelty of the instructions. Therefore, we conclude that the implementation of verbal instructions results from an interplay of a brain areas that represent novel rulelike information in domain general terms and brain areas that are specific to S-R rules...|$|E
40|$|We report 4 {{experiments}} examining whether {{associations in}} visual working memory {{are subject to}} proactive interference from long-term memory (LTM). Following a long-term learning phase in which participants learned the colors of 120 unique objects, a working memory (WM) test was administered in which participants recalled the precise colors of 3 concrete objects in an array. Each array in the WM test consisted of 1 old (previously learned) object with a new color (old-mismatch), 1 old object with its old color (old-match), and 1 new object. Experiments 1 to 3 showed that WM performance was better in the old-match condition than in the new condition, reflecting a beneficial contribution from LTM. In the old-mismatch condition, participants sometimes reported colors associated with the relevant shape in LTM, but the probability of successful recall was equivalent {{to that in the}} new condition. Thus, information from LTM only intruded in the absence of reportable information in WM. Experiment 4 tested for, and failed to find, proactive interference from the preceding trial in the WM test: Performance in the old-mismatch condition, presenting an object from the preceding trial with a new color, was equal to performance with new objects. Experiment 5 showed that long-term memory for <b>object-color</b> associations is subject to proactive interference. We conclude that the exchange of information between LTM and WM appears to be controlled by a gating mechanism that protects the contents of WM from proactive interference but admits LTM information when it is useful.

40|$|Previous neuroimaging {{research}} indicates that white matter injury and integrity, measured respectively by white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and fractional anisotropy (FA) obtained from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), differ with aging and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and are associated with episodic memory deficits in cognitively normal older adults. However, knowledge about tract-specific relationships between WMH, FA, and episodic memory in aging remains limited. We hypothesized that white matter connections between frontal cortex and subcortical structures as well as connections between frontal and temporo-parietal cortex would be most affected. In the current study, we examined relationships between WMH, FA and episodic memory in 15 young adults, 13 elders with minimal WMH and 15 elders with extensive WMH, using an episodic recognition memory test for <b>object-color</b> associations. Voxel-based statistics were used to identify voxel clusters where white matter measures were specifically associated with variations in episodic memory performance, and white matter tracts intersecting these clusters were analyzed to examine white matter-memory relationships. White matter injury and integrity measures {{were significantly associated with}} episodic memory in extensive regions of white matter, located predominantly in frontal, parietal, and subcortical regions. Template based tractography indicated that white matter injury, as measured by WMH, in the uncinate and inferior longitudinal fasciculi were significantly negatively associated with episodic memory performance. Other tracts such as thalamo-frontal projections, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and dorsal cingulum bundle demonstrated strong negative associations as well. The results suggest that white matter injury to multiple pathways, including connections of frontal and temporal cortex and frontal-subcortical white matter tracts, plays a critical role in memory differences seen in older individuals...|$|E
40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the number of}} colors perceived by color normal and color-deficient observers {{when looking at the}} theoretic limits of <b>object-color</b> stimuli. These limits, the optimal color stimuli, were computed for a color normal observer and CIE standard illuminant D 65, and the resultant colors were expressed in the CIELAB and DIN 99 d color spaces. The corresponding color volumes for abnormal color vision were computed using models simulating for normal trichromatic observers the appearance for dichromats and anomalous trichomats. The number of colors perceived in each case was then computed from the color volumes enclosed by the optimal colors also known as MacAdam limits. It was estimated that dichromats perceive less than 1 % of the colors perceived by normal trichromats and that anomalous trichromats perceive 50 %– 60 % for anomalies in the medium-wavelength-sensitive and 60 %– 70 % for anomalies in the long-wavelength-sensitive cones. Complementary estimates obtained similarly for the spectral locus of monochromatic stimuli suggest less impairment for color-deficient observers, a fact that is explained by the two-dimensional nature of the locus.

40|$|Source {{memory is}} defined as memory for not only the core aspect of some event, but {{additional}} contextual detail about that core aspect, or item. Source memory tasks are marked by their engagement of prefrontal cortex {{in addition to the}} brain circuits required by other episodic memory tasks. The dissertation examines the relationships among source memory accuracy, concurrent brain activity, and general cognitive principles derived from the study of episodic memory more generally. Electrical measures of brain activity (event-related potentials, ERPs) were recorded while manipulating factors hypothesized to improve or worsen source memory accuracy. The first experiment manipulated the task assigned during the encoding phase and its match to the retrieval demands of remembering objects (depicted in drawings) and their colors. As predicted by the principle of transfer-appropriate processing, source accuracy was higher when the encoding task fostered integration of the item (object) and source (color) attributes. Prefrontal activity during the retrieval phase was greatly reduced when retrieval could benefit from transfer-appropriate processing. In associative memory tasks, poor memory performance is observed when the to-be-retained stimuli share elements with other studied stimuli, as in a variety of interference paradigms. The second experiment thus examined the impact of feature overlap on source recognition by varying the quantitative mapping between the shape and color of an object depicted in a drawing. The results showed two frontal processes supporting source retrieval: an early differentiation between stimuli identical to those encoded and those that switch colors from study to test, and a later effect reflecting prolonged memory search that was truncated by reinstating unique <b>object-color</b> pairings at test. The final experiment compared conjunctions of "intra-item" versus "extra-item" features, by placing the features within a single visual object or distributing them across two visual objects. Source accuracy was worse when shape and color were spatially separated, but prefrontal activity did not vary. The insensitivity of prefrontal ERPs to this perceptual manipulation of difficulty stands in contrast to their sensitivity to encoding task. Individual variability in parietal ERPs was strongly correlated with source accuracy, and likely reflects a contribution of visual working memory to long-term memory...|$|E
