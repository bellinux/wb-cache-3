5|$|Because {{of their}} great size, supertankers often cannot enter port fully loaded. These ships {{can take on}} their cargo at {{off-shore}} platforms and single-point moorings. On the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> journey, they often pump their cargo off to smaller tankers at designated lightering points off-coast. A supertanker's routes are generally long, requiring it to stay at sea for extended periods, up to and beyond seventy days at a time.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rod placed deep into the ground. The sharp point of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the iron rod instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} prototyping grasp-sensitive surfaces using optical fibers. In this system one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a fiber bundle is attached to an image sensor. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual fibers are attached to distinct points of a surface. Thus the image sensor can detect changes in light reception caused by a hand covering the surface. By emitting infrared light through the surface and measuring <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> reflected light <b>the</b> system can also recognize touch and proximity. Mapping between pixels on the image sensor and fiber positions on the surface is generated by a relative calibration method. This setup allows to quickly build grasp-sensitive objects without electronics skills...|$|R

40|$|NOVELTY - The {{mechanism}} has two interconnected gripper arms (1, 2), {{which are}} always in lateral contact with a wafer disc (3) edge at one end. These ends can move radially outwards by pressure, or tension, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holder. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gripper arms are secured in a holder (7). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - There are elastic elements, which can return <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gripper arms into the initial position after release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holder. The gripper arms are preferably made <b>of</b> titanium. <b>The</b> disc engaging <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gripper arms are fitted with slide shoes (5) with recesses for the disc retention.

Realising he could not reach it, he moved back towards his goal, but de Wolf outjumped defender Chris Lawler to head {{the ball into the}} Liverpool goal. The {{conditions}} were so poor, that the crowd celebrated in stages. Those closest to the goal celebrated immediately, while those at the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium reacted to these celebrations. Liverpool striker Hunt had a chance to score in the 12th minute, but his shot was saved by Ajax goalkeeper Gert Bals. Following the goal Ajax continued to attack, midfielder Sjaak Swart ran past three Liverpool players before passing the ball to Klaas Nuninga, whose shot was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Lawrence. However, Lawrence dropped the ball near Johan Cruyff, who scored to give Ajax a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{inhabit the}} tropics, {{as well as}} {{temperate}} and boreal waters. A number of species can survive and even flourish in extreme conditions. They are abundant in the Arctic, about 140 species being known from that zone. The Antarctic scallop, Adamussium colbecki, lives under the sea ice at the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> globe, where the subzero temperatures mean that growth rates are very slow. The giant mussel, Bathymodiolus thermophilus, and the giant white clam, Calyptogena magnifica, both live clustered around hydrothermal vents at abyssal depths in the Pacific Ocean. They have chemosymbiotic bacteria in their gills that oxidise hydrogen sulphide, and the molluscs absorb nutrients synthesized by these bacteria. The saddle oyster, Enigmonia aenigmatica, is a marine species {{that could be considered}} amphibious. It lives above the high tide mark in the tropical Indo-Pacific on the underside of mangrove leaves, on mangrove branches, and on sea walls in the splash zone.|$|E

Gordon fights his way through Black Mesa, defending himself against hostile Xen creatures — such as Vortigaunts and parasitic headcrabs, which attach themselves to human hosts — and US marines sent to cover up the incident. At the surface, Gordon learns that scientists from the Lambda Complex may have a way to close the portal. Gordon travels to the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facility to assist them.

40|$|Abstract [...] The paper {{investigates the}} {{transient}} behaviour {{and stability of}} a system consisting of two thermally conducting elastic rods in contact on their <b>end</b> faces, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rods being built-in to two rigid walls which are maintained at different temperatures. It is assumed {{that there is a}} thermal resistance at the interface between the rods which is a known function of contact pressure or gap. A perturbation method is used to analyse <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system and it is shown that there is a range of conditions under which the steady-state solution is unique but unstable. A finite difference method is then used to model the transient behaviour; it shows that under such conditions the system always tends to a steady oscillatory state in which the contact pressure varies periodically with time, possibly with periods of separation. 1...|$|R

5|$|Many {{tropical}} cyclones develop {{when the}} atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance {{in the atmosphere}} are favorable. Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics. Tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an eye. On the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses. A tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E
