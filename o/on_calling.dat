5|$|On February 10, 1798, Garrard's son William, still {{serving in}} the state senate, {{introduced}} a bill to hold another vote <b>on</b> <b>calling</b> a constitutional convention. In May 1798, 9,188 of the 16,388 votes {{were in favor of}} calling a convention. Again, almost 5,000 of the ballots contained no vote either way. On November 21, 1798, the House of Representatives voted 3615 in favor of a convention, and the Senate provided its requisite two-thirds majority days later. No official tally of the Senate's vote was published. The Assembly's vote rendered moot any doubts about the popular vote.|$|E
5|$|Global News {{reporter}} Jennifer Tryon {{attempted to}} file a Freedom of Information request for documents on June 29, but was refused; an employee came out {{from the back of}} the offices, and turned the City Clerk's chair around, so that they couldn't respond. City officials then called the OPP. After the request, the city issued a two line statement that documents are now part of investigations. OPP noted that the documents are still available through Freedom of Information requests, and that the situation likely didn't warrant an emergency call to police. The reporter was provided a FOI application on police arrival, and told to ignore instructions from their superiors <b>on</b> <b>calling</b> police. Tryon, producer Kieron O'Dea and cameraman Trevor Owens would later receive a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Breaking National News Reportage at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards.|$|E
50|$|A doctor {{remained}} <b>on</b> <b>call</b> between {{shifts and}} was given a room to sleep in at the hospital. The collective agreement said the average time working when <b>on</b> <b>call</b> (periods between 16 and 25 hours) should not exceed 49% of the <b>on</b> <b>call</b> period. Dr Jaeger argued that all <b>on</b> <b>call</b> time {{should be regarded as}} working time. The Bundesarbeitsgericht asked for a preliminary ruling, asking whether under art 3 and art 6 of 93/104/EC time spent <b>on</b> <b>call</b> was working time (as implemented by the Law on Working Time 1994 §5 III in Germany). The law said Dr Jaeger had to stay at work, but could sleep there if not required to work. On average, Dr Jaeger did spend 49% of his time <b>on</b> <b>call.</b> The time spent inactive was deemed to be a rest period.|$|R

Less acute specialties such as dermatology could have juniors permanently <b>on</b> <b>call.</b> The European Union's controversial Working Time Directive conflicted with this: at first the UK negotiated an opt-out for some years, but working hours needed reform. <b>On</b> <b>call</b> time was unpaid until 1975 (the year of the house officers' one-day strike), and {{for a year or two}} depended on certification by the consultant in charge - a number of them refused to sign. <b>On</b> <b>call</b> time was at first paid at 30% of the standard rate. Before paid <b>on</b> <b>call</b> was introduced, there would be several house officers [...] "in the house" [...] at any one time and the [...] "second on call" [...] house officer could go out, provided they kept the hospital informed of their telephone number at all times.|$|R

5|$|Citadel was {{the last}} German {{strategic}} offensive on the Eastern Front, {{and one of the}} largest battles in history, involving more than four million men. By the time the Wehrmacht launched their initial assault on 5 July 1943, the Soviet forces outnumbered them by nearly three to one. Walther Model was in command of the northern pincer, with the Ninth Army, while Manstein's Army Group South formed the southern pincer. Both armies were slowed as the tanks were blown up in minefields and caught up in combat on a series of prepared Soviet defensive lines. After five days of fighting Model's advance was stopped, with the Ninth Panzers suffering 25,000 casualties. By 13 July Model's forces were being drawn away towards Orel, where the Soviet army had launched Operation Kutuzov. Manstein's forces were able to penetrate the Soviet lines, causing heavy casualties. He reached, but did not enter or capture, Prokhorovka, his first major objective, on 11 July, inflicting serious Soviet losses in the resulting Battle of Prokhorovka. However, on 13 July Hitler called off the failed Kursk offensive; the Allies had landed in Sicily, so he issued the order for a withdrawal. Manstein protested; he felt that the Soviet forces had exhausted all their reserves in the area, and {{he did not want to}} stop until all his own reserves had been committed. Hitler, however, insisted <b>on</b> <b>calling</b> off the operation. Although Soviet casualties were indeed heavy, modern historians discount the possibility of a successful German continuation of the offensive.|$|E

25|$|Tanguy at {{the time}} was married to Jeannette Ducroq, but they were separated, and he and Sage {{immediately}} fell in love. Breton and most of the other Surrealists were much less welcoming. Sage, still well off, was generous with her money, and the group of impoverished artists badly needed such support, but they resented her wealth and what they felt was a haughty attitude that fitted her former title of “Princess” all too well. Her alliance with Tanguy caused a rift between Tanguy and Breton, who had formerly been close friends. Shrugging off this rejection, Sage went <b>on</b> <b>calling</b> herself a Surrealist.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} side-effect of Ethiopian Christianity {{was the way}} it intersected with {{a belief}} that had long prevailed in Europe of the existence of a Christian kingdom in the far east, whose monarch was known as Prester John. Originally thought to have been in the Orient, eventually the search for Prester John's mythical kingdom focused on Africa and particularly, the Christian empire in Ethiopia. This was first noticed when Zara Yaqob sent delegates to the Council of Florence in order to establish ties with the papacy and Western Christianity. They were confused when they arrived and council prelates insisted <b>on</b> <b>calling</b> their monarch Prester John, trying to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur.

As he waits for the pill to take effect he wanders through the hotel and meets an anonymous man who, in fact, is famous playwright Clare Quilty, a friend of the now-deceased Charlotte. Quilty talks to him ambiguously about Dolores. Humbert excuses himself from the conversation and returns to the hotel room. There, he finds that the sedative was too mild after seeing Dolores drifting in and out of sleep. He dares not touch her that night, but in the morning Humbert is surprised when she initiates sex with him. While driving the next day, Humbert finally reveals to Dolores that her mother is dead after Dolores insists <b>on</b> <b>calling</b> her from a pay phone.|$|E

The Court may also exercise powers that it exercises upon an appeal, such as reversing a conviction or altering a sentence, except that the Court is not authorized to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction to convert a finding of acquittal into one of conviction.

Matt Pryor had been writing songs {{since he was}} a teenager, and was playing in a band called Secret Decoder Ring. Following the demise of the two bands in 1995, The Get Up Kids were formed. The band originally planned <b>on</b> <b>calling</b> themselves [...] "The Suburban Get Up Kids", until reasoning that there were fewer band names beginning with the letter 'G' than there are with the letter 'S', and that therefore {{they were more likely to}} be noticed in a record store if their name began with a 'G'.

500|$|In 1923, Frederick Treves {{published}} a volume, The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences, {{in which he}} detailed what he knew of Merrick's life and their personal interactions. This account {{is the source of}} much of what is known about Merrick, but there were several inaccuracies in the book. Merrick never completely confided in Treves about his early life, so these details were consequently sketchy in Treves's Reminiscences. A more mysterious error is that of Merrick's first name. Treves, in his earlier journal articles as well as his book, insisted <b>on</b> <b>calling</b> him John Merrick. The reason for this is unclear; Merrick clearly signed his name as [...] "Joseph" [...] in the examples of his handwriting that remain. In the handwritten manuscript for The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences, Treves began his account by writing [...] "Joseph" [...] and then crossed it out and replaced it with [...] "John". Whatever the reason for the error, it is one that persisted throughout much of the 20th century; later biographers who based their work on Treves's book have continued the error.|$|E
500|$|Art Modell, a New York {{advertising}} executive, {{bought the}} team in 1961 for almost $4 million ($ today).

[...] This angered Brown, who was used to having a free hand in football matters. Modell, who was single and only {{a few years older than}} most players, started to listen to their concerns about the coach. He became particularly close to Jim Brown, calling him [...] "my senior partner". Modell sat in the press box during games and could be overheard second-guessing Paul Brown's play-calling, which drove a deeper wedge between the two men. At that time, Brown was the only coach who insisted <b>on</b> <b>calling</b> every offensive play. When Plum openly questioned Paul Brown's absolute control over play-calling, he was traded to Detroit.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after Banks and Rutherford {{decided to}} {{continue}} Genesis in 1996, {{they went to}} The Farm to start writing Calling All Stations. Rutherford initially found the sessions difficult as he saw Collins as [...] "the guy in the middle" [...] who made Banks and himself work better. Their best ideas developed in this period were put forward while they auditioned new singers, including Francis Dunnery and Nick Van Eede. The two main contenders, David Longdon of Big Big Train and Scottish singer Ray Wilson of Stiltskin, auditioned throughout 1996 which involved singing along to Genesis tracks with the lead vocals removed. Wilson was announced as the new Genesis singer in June 1997. Though much of the album was already written {{by the time he}} joined, Banks was pleased with his contributions to the album which included writing the lyrics to [...] "Small Talk" [...] and riffs on [...] "Not About Us" [...] and [...] "There Must Be Some Other Way".

500|$|The static {{area command}} system was {{well suited to}} defence, but less so for an {{offensive}} posture. In September 1942, therefore, the Air Force created a large [...] mobile formation known as No.9 Operational Group, {{to act as a}} self-contained tactical air force that would be able to keep pace with Allied advances through the South West Pacific theatre. By September 1943, however, No.9 Group had become a static garrison force in New Guinea, similar to the area commands on mainland Australia, and a new mobile group was required to support the advance north towards the Philippines and Japan. This was formed in November 1943 as No.10 Operational Group (later the Australian First Tactical Air Force), which initially came under No.9 Group's control. To better reflect No.9 Group's new status, the head of RAAF Command, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, recommended renaming it Northern Area. RAAF Headquarters did not agree to this at first, but on 11April 1944 settled <b>on</b> <b>calling</b> it Northern Command, under the same AOC who commanded No.9 Group, Air Commodore Frank Lukis. On its formation the command was headquartered at Milne Bay.|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{uses her}} many roles, incarnations, and identities {{throughout}} her books {{to illustrate how}} oppression and personal history are interrelated. For example, in Caged Bird, Angelou demonstrates the [...] "racist habit" [...] of renaming African Americans, as shown when her white employer insists <b>on</b> <b>calling</b> her [...] "Mary". [...] Angelou describes the employer's renaming as the [...] "hellish horror of being 'called out of [...] name'". [...] Scholar Debra Walker King calls it a racist insult and an assault against Maya's race and self-image. The renaming emphasizes Maya's feelings of inadequacy and denigrates her identity, individuality, and uniqueness. Maya understands that she is being insulted and rebels by breaking Mrs. Cullinan's favorite dish, but feels vindicated when, as she leaves her employer's home, Mrs. Cullinan finally gets her name right. Another incident {{in the book that}} solidifies Maya's identity is her trip to Mexico with her father, when she has to drive a car for the first time. Contrasted with her experience in Stamps, Maya is finally [...] "in control of her fate". [...] This experience is central to Maya's growth, as is the incident that immediately follows it, her short period of homelessness after arguing with her father's girlfriend. These two incidents give Maya a knowledge of self-determination and confirm her self-worth.|$|E
