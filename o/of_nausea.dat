5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists <b>of</b> <b>nausea,</b> vomiting, a pale appearance, and sweating. However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of metabolic acidosis and coma early in the course of poisoning.|$|E

40|$|Background: Postoperative {{nausea and}} {{vomiting}} {{as well as}} postoperative pain are two major concerns when patients undergo surgery and receive anesthetics. Various models and predictive methods {{have been developed to}} investigate the risk factors <b>of</b> postoperative <b>nausea</b> and vomiting, and different types of preventive managements have subsequently been developed. However, there continues to be a wide variation in the previously reported incidence rates <b>of</b> postoperative <b>nausea</b> and vomiting. This may have occurred because patients were assessed at different time points, coupled with the overall limitation of the statistical methods used. However, using survival analysis with Cox regression, and thus factoring in these time effects, may solve this statistical limitation and reveal risk factors related to the occurrence <b>of</b> postoperative <b>nausea</b> and vomiting in the following period. Methods: In this retrospective, observational, uni-institutional study, we analyzed the results of 229 patients who received patient-controlled epidural analgesia following surgery from June 2007 to December 2007. We investigated the risk factors for the occurrence <b>of</b> postoperative <b>nausea</b> and vomiting, and also assessed the effect of evaluating patients at different time points using the Cox proportional hazards model. Furthermore, the results of this inquiry were compared with those results using logistic regression. Results: The overall incidence <b>of</b> postoperative <b>nausea</b> and vomiting in our study was 35. 4 %. Using logistic regression, we found that only sex, but not the total doses and the average dose of opioids, had significant effects on the occurrence <b>of</b> postoperative <b>nausea</b> and vomiting at some time points. Cox regression showed that, when patients consumed a higher average dose of opioids, this correlated with a higher incidence <b>of</b> postoperative <b>nausea</b> and vomiting with a hazard ratio of 1. 286. Conclusion: Survival analysis using Cox regression showed that the average consumption of opioids {{played an important role in}} postoperative nausea and vomiting, a result not found by logistic regression. Therefore, the incidence <b>of</b> postoperative <b>nausea</b> and vomiting in patients cannot be reliably determined on the basis of a single visit at one point in time...|$|R
50|$|Gastrointestinal infections (37%) {{and food}} {{poisoning}} {{are the two}} most common causes <b>of</b> acute <b>nausea</b> and vomiting. Side effects from medications (3%) and pregnancy are also relatively frequent. There are many causes <b>of</b> chronic <b>nausea.</b> Nausea and vomiting remain undiagnosed in 10% of the cases, with rates about 6% in children and more than 16% in people aged more than 65 years.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of pre-emergence gastric aspiration on the incidence <b>of</b> postoperative <b>nausea</b> and vomiting in abdominal surgery patients. Thirty female ASA I and ASA II patients were randomly assigned to either a control group (n = 16) or a treatment group (n = 14). Those patients in the treatment group received pre-emergence gastric aspiration with a suction catheter; those patients in the control group did not. The incidence <b>of</b> postoperative <b>nausea</b> and vomiting was determined at various time intervals. Data were analyzed using Student 2 ̆ 7 s t test and the Chi-square statistic. Results indicated that {{there was no difference in}} the occurrence <b>of</b> postoperative <b>nausea</b> and vomiting between the groups...|$|R
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of poisoning are typically gastrointestinal and neurological. Symptoms occur within 6–12hours of consumption, although cases of more severe poisoning may present sooner—as little as 2 hours after ingestion. Initial symptoms are gastrointestinal, with sudden onset <b>of</b> <b>nausea,</b> vomiting, and watery diarrhea {{which may be}} bloodstained. Dehydration may develop if the vomiting or diarrhea is severe. Dizziness, lethargy, vertigo, tremor, ataxia, nystagmus, and headaches develop soon after; fever often occurs, a distinctive feature which does not develop after poisoning by other types of mushrooms. In most cases of poisoning, symptoms do not progress from these initial symptoms, and patients recover after 2–6 days of illness.|$|E
5|$|To more {{effectively}} minimize recurrence {{and severity of}} epistaxis, other options {{may be used in}} conjunction with therapies listed above. Intravenously administered anti-VEGF substances such as bevacizumab (brand name Avastin), pazopinab and thalidomide or its derivatives interfere with the production of new blood vessels that are weak and therefore prone to bleeding. Due to the past experiences with prescribing thalidomide to pregnant women to alleviate symptoms <b>of</b> <b>nausea</b> and the terrible birth defects that followed, thalidomide is a last resort therapy. Additionally, thalidomide can cause neuropathy. Though this can be mitigated by tinkering with dosages and prescribing its derivatives such as lenolidomide and pomalidomide, many doctors prefer alternative VEGF inhibitors. Bevacizumab has been shown to significantly reduce the severity of epistaxis without side effects.|$|E
5|$|Tricholoma pardinum is one {{of several}} {{poisonous}} members of the genus Tricholoma; its large size, fleshy appearance, and pleasant smell and taste add to the risk of it being accidentally consumed. It was responsible for over 20 percent of cases of mushroom poisoning in Switzerland {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. Many cases of poisoning arise in the Jura Mountains. Eating it causes highly unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms <b>of</b> <b>nausea,</b> dizziness, vomiting, and diarrhea. These arise 15minutes to 2hours after consumption and often persist for several hours; complete recovery usually takes 4 to 6 days. Sweating and anxiety may be evident, and disturbance in liver function has been recorded. Cramping may occur in the calves. In one case, seven people and a cat suffered severe symptoms after sharing a meal that contained only two mushroom caps. The toxin, the identity of which is unknown, appears to cause a sudden inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the stomach and intestines.|$|E

The present study employed a prospective design to identify patient-and treatment-related variables characteristic of patients who subsequently develop anticipatory nausea. Seventy-one chemotherapy outpatients were interviewed before and after each chemotherapy infusion during their first 6 months of treatment. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that patients who developed anticipatory nausea were characterized by more severe posttreatment nausea, more time-consuming treatment infusions, and greater state anxiety relative to patients without anticipatory nausea. In general, results supported a respondent learning conceptualization of the development <b>of</b> anticipatory <b>nausea.</b> Clinical implications <b>of</b> these findings for the prevention <b>of</b> anticipatory <b>nausea</b> are suggested.

40|$|Study Objective: {{to assess}} the {{efficacy}} and safety of different combinations of antiemetic drugs and adjuvants as part of anesthetic care in prevention <b>of</b> postoperative <b>nausea</b> and vomiting in oncological patients. Materials and methods: 165 patients who undergone surgical treatment for female oncological diseases on the II—III stages with common anaesthesia were included. Depending on the scheme <b>of</b> postoperative <b>nausea</b> and vomiting prevention participants were divided into 4 groups. Patients from group С (comparative, n= 43) received treatment with ondansetron (8 mg) and dexamethasone (8 mg) in the induction stage. Patients from group E (n= 40) additionnaly received continuous infusion of esmolol 0, 59 ± 0, 94 mg/kg/h. Patients from group D (n= 41) on the traumatic stage of operation received bolus of intravenous droperidol 0, 038 ± 0, 055 mg/kg. Patients from group K (n= 41) on the traumatic stage of operation received bolus of intravenous of clonidine 0, 0013 ± 0, 0004 mg/kg. Postoperative nausea and vomiting episodes were monitored during 24 hours after the surgery. Results: in group С postoperative nausea and vomiting developed in 15 patients from 43 (34, 9 %). In group E this complication was detected in 8 from 40 patients (20 %). In group D &# 8211; in 8 from 41 patients (19, 5 %). Groups E and D did not have statistically significant differences from group С {{in terms of the}} frequency <b>of</b> postoperative <b>nausea</b> and vomiting. In group С this complication was detected in 6 from 41 patients with the rate of 14, 6 % which is significantly lower than in group С (p= 0. 03). The intensity <b>of</b> the <b>nausea</b> and vomiting was lower in groups E,D, and K as compared with group С. Conclusion: the inclusion of clonidine in scheme <b>of</b> postoperative <b>nausea</b> and vomiting prevention lead to statistically significant decrease of the frequency of this complication.
