5|$|He {{had always}} been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He went <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The {{difficulty}} toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.|$|E
5|$|Palomino Sue {{hails from}} Abilene, Texas. Her {{father was a}} wagon master. She arrived at Boys' Ranch after a trip <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> her father was driving was intercepted by Indians. She was the only survivor. When expressing a desire to get {{involved}} in fighting, Clay Duncan insists that, because it's too dangerous for a woman, she must remain at the ranch. She agrees, but her acquiescence was a pretence, as she later joins the fray, offering opportune assistance. Similar scenes recur in her two subsequent appearances in issues #5 and 6.|$|E
25|$|An obedience-trained Dalmatian dog also {{travels with}} each hitch, a Budweiser {{tradition}} since the 1950s. Historically, {{the role of}} the dogs was to guard the wagon and protect the team while the driver went inside buildings to make deliveries. When the team performs today, the Dalmatians sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon,</b> seated next to the driver. The wagons are Studebaker wagons modified to carry beer, originally manufactured circa 1900.|$|E

25|$|The first assault <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> box corral {{came from}} mounted warriors from the southwest, but the raiders {{encountered}} heavy {{fire from the}} soldiers using the new breech-loaders. The attackers withdrew, regrouped, and launched several further attacks on foot. They killed Powell's second-in-command, Lt. Jenness, and two soldiers. The battle continued from about 7:30 a.m. until 1:30 pm. The defenders had plenty of ammunition, and were well-defended from arrows behind the thick sides of the wagon boxes.|$|E
25|$|The {{hatchback}} coupe {{features a}} lower roofline and a fold-down rear seat. The notchback sedan {{had the lowest}} price {{and is the only}} Vega model with an enclosed trunk. The Safari wagon has fixed rear-side glass and a swing-up liftgate. A panel delivery based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> was sold through the 1975 model year. It has steel panels in place of the rear-side glass, and an additional enclosed storage area. An auxiliary front passenger seat was optional.|$|E
25|$|The wagon train, mostly {{families}} from Arkansas, was bound for California on a route that {{passed through the}} Utah Territory, during a conflict later known as the Utah War. After arriving in Salt Lake City, the Baker–Fancher party made their way south, eventually stopping to rest at Mountain Meadows. While the emigrants were camped at the meadow, nearby militia leaders, including Isaac C. Haight and John D. Lee, joined forces to organize an attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> train.|$|E
5|$|Tito, {{his staff}} and his escort {{continued}} toward Kupres, travelling on foot and by horseback, as well as <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> of a narrow-gauge logging railway. During this trek, {{one of the members}} of the Soviet mission was wounded by shellfire.|$|R
50|$|Caesar {{says that}} the enemy camp was defended by a wagon train, drawn up behind the German forces, which had now either to fight or to run. The usual chorus of wailing women was placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons.</b> <b>The</b> effect that it really had <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Germanic {{soldiers}} is unclear. The idea was to place the tribe {{in a situation where}} they must be victorious or be annihilated with their women and children.|$|R

25|$|Intending to {{give the}} {{appearance}} of Native American aggression, the militia's plan was to arm some Southern Paiute Native Americans and persuade them to join with a larger party of their own militiamen—disguised as Native Americans—in an attack. During the militia's first assault <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> train the emigrants fought back, and a five-day siege ensued. Eventually fear spread among the militia's leaders that some emigrants had caught sight of white men and had likely discovered the identity of their attackers. As a result militia commander William H. Dame ordered his forces to kill the emigrants.|$|E
25|$|Following the war {{the pioneers}} {{returned}} to Clinton Township and reestablished their homesteads. By this time {{most of the}} Native Americans had either been killed off or fled to the west. The settlers encountered some struggles over the years, most notably {{in the winter of}} 1787. This winter was especially harsh in Clinton Township. Nearly all the livestock was either frozen to death or they died of starvation. The supplies of food stored after the harvest were quickly depleted and the people began to starve. Hunters struggled through the deep snow. Even those that were able to use snowshoes to walk on top of the snow struggled to find any game, which also struggled to survive the harsh winter. When the winter finally broke the residents were able to harvest tremendous amounts of shad in Black Hole Creek and in the West Branch Susquehanna River with a seine that was delivered to them by the father-in-law of Major Ten Brook, Mr. Emmons. Mr. Emmons arrived from New Jersey with additional supplies including salt, wheat, corn, and garden seeds. He is credited with saving the lives of many of the early residents of Clinton Township. Emmons returned again in 1788 with another wagon load of supplies, while camping he was killed by a tree that fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> where he was sleeping.|$|E
500|$|In June 1864, Major Joseph K. Stearns of the 1st New York Cavalry arrived {{under orders}} {{to burn the}} town down to help stop Confederate ambushes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> road. Because the {{remaining}} population mostly consisted of women, children and the elderly, Stearns allowed the town to stand. He required the adult residents to take the [...] "Ironclad oath", in which they swore {{that they had not}} voluntarily provided aid to the Confederacy. The government required the oath, effectively excluding ex-Confederates from the political arena during Reconstruction Era.|$|E

50|$|Railway workers {{attach the}} cable to <b>the</b> upper <b>wagon,</b> and detach {{it when it}} arrives {{at the other end}} of the incline. Generally, {{special-purpose}} safety couplings are used rather than <b>the</b> ordinary <b>wagon</b> couplings. <b>The</b> cables may be guided between <b>the</b> rails <b>on</b> <b>the</b> incline by a series of rollers so that they do not fall across the rail where they would be damaged by <b>the</b> wheels <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Loading gauges vary considerably, {{and through}} trains {{would be forced}} to use the most {{restrictive}} loading gauge along its route. The structure gauge of tunnels and bridges needs to be about 1 m taller to allow for piggy back operation of trains of one gauge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> of another gauge.|$|R

Robert Horton starred in this episode, which aired three months after the death of Ward Bond.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 February 1923 Mayakovsky and Lilya Brik {{met again}} {{and went for}} several days to Petrograd together. In her 1956 book of memoirs Brik remembered:I came to the railway station and found him on the platform, waiting for me <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> steps. As the train started, Volodya, leaning on the door read me the poem About That. Having finished, he burst into tears, immensely relieved. Now, {{in the course of}} those two months I often had pangs of consciousness. Volodya was {{suffering}} there alone, while I lived an ordinary life, was seeing people, visiting places. Now I felt happy. For the poem that I've just heard wouldn't have been written should I have not chosen Volodya as my personal ideal and an impersonation of an ideal human being." ...|$|E
2500|$|The top of {{the line}} models were named American GFS (Concord DL two-door), American ECD (Concord DL four-door), and Camioneta American Automática (Concord DL wagon). All three {{featured}} automatic transmissions, power brakes, power steering, [...] six-cylinder (258 on ECD) with new-for-the-year Motorcraft two-barrel carburetor and 8.0:1 compression ratio, 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio, light group (courtesy, ashtray, glovebox, hood and trunk; the last one unavailable <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon),</b> custom steering wheel, woodgrain panels on dashboard, parcel shelf, clock, retractable seat belts, luxury upholstery, tinted windshield, bright molding package (wheel arches, drip rails, rocker panels, front hood edge, hood ornament), engine displacement [...] "4.6" [...] emblems ("4.2" [...] on ECD), wheel covers, and bumper guards. The GFS model included a floor-shift transmission and reclining individual high-back seats, while the ECD and automatic wagon had column-shift coupled with a bench front seat. Both sedan models incorporated vinyl roof either in full form (ECD) or Landau type (GFS). The most unusual looking of these models in contrast with AMC's versions was the GFS model as it incorporated the flip-open rear side opera windows and the targa band used in the 1977 AMC Hornet AMX models (the same treatment used in the Hornet-based 1977 VAM American GFS). The optional equipment list on these models included air conditioning system with heavy duty cooling (seven-blade flexible fan, three-line radiator, fan shroud, coolant recovery tank and 55 amp alternator), reading dome light, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, passenger's side remote mirror, and rear defroster.|$|E

The standard [...] I6 engine came with a single-barrel carburetor and three-speed manual transmission with column-shift <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> and four-door, or a floor-shift on the two-door. A three-speed automatic transmission was optional with column-mounted shifter in all three body styles; and ordering it included power steering, bumper guards, and the heater without extra cost in both sedan models. As for the base wagon, which had the heater regularly as standard, got a full high-trim upgrade included with the order of the automatic transmission. The four-door sedan and wagon featured a front bench seat, while the two-door sedan included low-back individual non-reclining seats. Standard were non-power brakes with front disks and rear drums, front sway bar, manual steering, a 3.31:1 rear differential gear ratio, plain blacked-out dashboard, [...] dual speedometer, fixed three-point front seatbelts (retractable on base wagon), inside hood release, front ashtray, lighter, locking glove box, AM radio with antenna, rear ashtrays, round dome light, electric two-speed wipers, electric washers, flat volcano hubcaps with exposed lug nuts, [...] "American" [...] fender emblems, [...] "4.2" [...] rear quarter emblems, manual driver's side remote mirror, base steering wheel and roof rack (wagon only).
