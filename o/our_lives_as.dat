Joey rooms with his best friend Chandler for years, and later with Rachel. He falls in love with Rachel in season eight, but Rachel politely tells Joey that she does not share his feelings.

500|$|In an {{official}} statement, film executive Bob Weinstein called Stefani and Williams [...] "the perfect artistic duo", saying their work [...] "brought to life the charm that Paddington represents". Stefani said her involvement {{was motivated by}} her personal connection to the film's setting through her marriage to English musician Gavin Rossdale. She added that the film and the track allowed her children to recognise their origins. Williams considered the song to be [...] "a wonderful opportunity, as a parent, to contribute to something as classic, authentic and generational to all of <b>our</b> <b>lives,</b> <b>as</b> Paddington Bear"; Stefani {{said that she was}} [...] "honored to join forces with Pharrell and be part of bringing this beloved classic to life for Paddington's next big adventure".

However, she did state she enjoyed Britney Spears' music, also mentioned in the song. [...] "Party in the U.S.A."

500|$|... "Obsessed" [...] {{was written}} by Roger Lavoie. Because the EP's {{production}} personnel did not understand it, the song was at first denied of inclusion. However, once [...] "Obsessed" [...] reached Cyrus, she continually insisted the track be included on the EP because she felt related to it. Cyrus described the song as depicting the emotions one feels when one cannot stop thinking of a person and believed it related to numerous fans having their first love. [...] "It's a really romantic song", she concluded. [...] "Before the Storm", originally released on the Jonas Brothers' fourth studio album Lines, Vines and Trying Times (2009), is included on The Time of <b>Our</b> <b>Lives</b> <b>as</b> a live rendition. The song {{was written by}} Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas, Kevin Jonas, and Cyrus. At first, the song was solely written by the Jonas Brothers for their third studio album A Little Bit Longer (2008), but {{did not make the}} final cut. Nick and Cyrus later reworked the song's lyrics to fit their past romance using a grand piano.|$|E
500|$|... "When I Look at You" [...] {{was written}} by Hillary Lindsey and John Shanks.

The song was first {{included}} on Cyrus's 2009 extended play The Time of Our Lives {{and then on the}} film and its corresponding soundtrack. The song was initially to be included on Cyrus's 2010 album Can't Be Tamed; however, it was decided to include it on The Time of <b>Our</b> <b>Lives</b> <b>as</b> well as The Last Song because it fit the film's concept well. According to Cyrus, when she sings [...] "When I Look at You", she thinks of family and love. [...] "It's kind of what this movie is all about", she said. A remix version titled [...] "Te Miro a Ti", featuring Spanish singer David Bisbal was released later; in it, Cyrus sings her lines in English, while Bisbal's are mingled in both English and Spanish.|$|E

Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> <b>as</b> we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E
