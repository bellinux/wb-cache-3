It was in the tone quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized the splendor of traditional Japanese music. I was very moved by it and I wondered why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E

[...] Not long after his arrival, Trenchard was {{called upon to}} make a speech at a mess dinner night. [...] It was common practice for the youngest subaltern {{to make such a}} speech and Trenchard was expected to cover several highlights of the Royal Scots Fusiliers' history. [...] Instead, he simply said [...] "I am deeply proud to belong to this great regiment", followed by [...] "I hope <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> shall live to command it." [...] His 'speech' was received with hoots of incredulous laughter, although some appreciated his nerve.|$|E

500|$|Pinto had {{a middle}} class {{upbringing}} in the suburb of Malad. She first {{wanted to be an}} actress when she was five years old, often dressing up and imitating television actors during her childhood. She later recalled being inspired by Sushmita Sen's victory in the 1994 Miss Universe competition, explaining that [...] "the country was really proud of her, and I was like, <b>one</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> want to do the same". Pinto attended the Carmel of St. Joseph School in Malad, and then studied at St. Xavier's College, Mumbai. Her major was in English literature, with minors in psychology and economics.

500|$|David Jason was {{the first}} actor to be cast for the production, as {{it had always been}} his desire to play Rincewind in a film {{adaptation}} of The Colour of Magic. Jason had mentioned in an interview some fifteen years previously that, of all the parts available, the character of Rincewind was the one he coveted the most. Jason describes the wizard as [...] "just such an amusing, endearing character... I always kept this idea in my head that <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> [...] play Rincewind". Jason's appointment to the role, announced in April 2007, drew mixed reactions, with comments ranging from [...] "terrible choice" [...] to [...] "brilliant". A common criticism was that Jason, at 68, was too old to play a character who is, according to the books, middle-aged.|$|E

500|$|In 2014, Rollins {{admitted}} a {{disdain for}} rehashing old {{music for the}} sake of it - [...] "I don’t want to play old music. To me, it is fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior. For me, I see no courage or adventure in doing the old thing over again. If others want to, that’s for them. For myself, I have to move on. Life is too short to live in the past. There is a lot to be done." [...] On the same topic, Henry more recently said in 2016 [...] "For me, music was a time and a place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was in me and it needed to come out, like a 25-year exorcism. <b>One</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> woke up, and I didn’t have any more lyrics.

A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, [...] "One day? I don't want <b>one</b> <b>day.</b> <b>I</b> want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot...

500|$|Britten was, as he acknowledged, {{notorious for}} dumping {{friends and colleagues}} who either {{offended}} him or ceased to be of use – his [...] "corpses". The conductor Sir Charles Mackerras believed that the term was invented by Lord Harewood. Both Mackerras and Harewood joined the list of corpses, the former for joking {{that the number of}} boys in Noye's Fludde must have been a delight to the composer, and the latter for an extramarital affair and subsequent divorce from Lady Harewood, which shocked the puritanical Britten. Among other corpses were his librettists Montagu Slater and Eric Crozier. The latter said in 1949, [...] "He has sometimes told me, jokingly, that <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> would join the ranks of his 'corpses' and I have always recognized that any ordinary person must soon outlive his usefulness to such a great creative artist as Ben." [...] Dame Janet Baker said in 1981, [...] "I think he was quite entitled to take what he wanted from others... He did not want to hurt anyone, but the task in hand was more important than anything or anybody." [...] Matthews feels that this aspect of Britten has been exaggerated, and he observes that the composer sustained many deep friendships {{to the end of his}} life.|$|E

500|$|Sheen worked {{predominantly}} in theatre in the 1990s and {{has since}} remarked that he will always feel [...] "slightly more at home" [...] on stage. [...] "It's more of an actor's medium. You are your own editor, nobody else is choosing what is being seen of you." [...] His first professional role, while still in his third and final year at RADA, was in When She Danced at the Globe Theatre in 1991. He later described the role as [...] "a big break. <b>One</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> was at RADA doing a movement class, the next I was at a read-through with Vanessa Redgrave and Frances de la Tour." [...] Milton Shulman of the Evening Standard praised an [...] "excellent" [...] performance while The Observer wrote of [...] "a notable West End debut".

His 1993 turn as Perdican in Alfred de Musset's Don't Fool With Love at the Donmar Warehouse was nominated for the Ian Charleson Award. and was described by The Independent as [...] "quite thrilling".

500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return <b>one</b> <b>day.</b> <b>I</b> went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E
