With pulse dialling, New Zealand telephones pulse in reverse to the UK - dialling 0 sent ten pulses, 1 sent nine, 2 sent eight, 3 sent seven, etc. in New Zealand, while in the UK, dialling 1 sent one pulse, 2 sent two, etc. In the early years of 111, the telephone equipment was based on British Post <b>Office</b> <b>equipment,</b> <b>except</b> for this unusual orientation. Therefore, dialling 111 on a New Zealand telephone sent three sets of nine pulses to the exchange, exactly the same as UK's 999.

40|$|There {{is concern}} that {{potentially}} harmful pollutants may be emitted from <b>office</b> <b>equipment.</b> Although <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> {{has been a}} focal point for governmental efforts to promote energy efficiency through programs such as the US EPA's Energy Star, {{little is known about the}} relationship between <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> use and indoor air quality, and information on pollutant emissions is sparse. In this review, we summarize available information on emission rates and/or ambient concentrations of various pollutants that are related to <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> use. Experimental methods used in the characterization of emissions are briefly described. The <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> evaluated in this review includes computers (desktops and notebooks), printers (laser, ink-jet and all-in-one machines) and photocopy machines. Reported emission rates of the following pollutant groups are summarized: volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), ozone, particulate matter and several semivolatile organic chemicals (SVOCs). The latter include phthalate esters, brominated flame retardants, organophosphate flame retardants and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We also review studies reporting airborne concentrations in indoor environments where <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> was present and thought to be a significant contributor to the total pollutant burden (offices, residences, schools, electronics recycling plants). For certain pollutants, such as organophosphate flame retardants, the link between emission by <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> and indoor air concentrations is relatively well established. However, indoor VOCs, ozone, PAHs and phthalate esters can originate from a variety of sources, and their source apportionment is less straightforward. This literature review identifies substances of toxicological significance, with the purpose of serving as a guide to evaluate their potential importance with respect to human exposures...|$|R

40|$|Electronic <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> has proliferated rapidly {{over the}} last twenty years and is {{projected}} to continue growing in the future. Efforts to reduce the growth in <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> energy use have focused on power management to reduce power consumption of electronic devices when not being used for their primary purpose. The EPA ENERGY STAR[registered trademark] program has been instrumental in gaining widespread support for power management in <b>office</b> <b>equipment,</b> and accurate information about the energy used by <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> in all power levels is important to improving program design and evaluation. This paper presents the results of a field study conducted during 2001 to measure the power levels of new monitors and personal computers. We measured off, on, and low-power levels in about 60 units manufactured since July 2000. The paper summarizes power data collected, explores differences within the sample (e. g., between CRT and LCD monitors), and discusses some issues that arise in m etering <b>office</b> <b>equipment.</b> We also present conclusions to help improve the success of future power management programs. Our findings include a trend among monitor manufacturers to provide a single very low low-power level, and the need to standardize methods for measuring monitor on power, to more accurately estimate the annual energy consumption of <b>office</b> <b>equipment,</b> as well as actual and potential energy savings from power management...|$|R
