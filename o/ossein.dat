2500|$|Bone {{tissue is}} a hard tissue, a type of dense {{connective}} tissue. [...] It has a honeycomb-like matrix internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity. [...] Bone tissue {{is made up of}} different types of bone cells. Osteoblasts and osteocytes are involved in the formation and mineralization of bone; osteoclasts are involved in the resorption of bone tissue. Modified (flattened) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface. The mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly collagen called <b>ossein</b> and an inorganic component of bone mineral made up of various salts. Bone tissue is a mineralized tissue of two types, cortical bone and cancellous bone. Other types of tissue found in bones include bone marrow, endosteum, periosteum, nerves, blood vessels and cartilage.|$|E
2500|$|Bone is not uniformly solid, but {{includes}} a tough matrix. This matrix makes up about 30% {{of the bone}} and the other 70% is of salts that give strength to it. [...] The matrix {{is made up of}} between 90 and 95% collagen fibers, and the remainder is ground substance. [...] The primary tissue of bone, bone tissue (osseous tissue), is relatively hard and lightweight. Its matrix is mostly made up of a composite material incorporating the inorganic mineral calcium phosphate in the chemical arrangement termed calcium hydroxylapatite (this is the bone mineral that gives bones their rigidity) and collagen, an elastic protein which improves fracture resistance. The collagen of bone is known as <b>ossein.</b> Bone is formed by the hardening of this matrix around entrapped cells. When these cells become entrapped from osteoblasts they become osteocytes.|$|E

5000|$|...Approximately 70% of {{bone and}} ivory {{are made up}} of an {{inorganic}} lattice composed of calcium phosphate and various carbonates and fluorides. The organic tissue of both is <b>ossein</b> and it constitutes at least 30%. It's difficult to distinguish them apart, unless examined microscopically. Both bone and ivory are easily warped by heat and moisture, and deteriorates by prolonged exposure of water.|$|E
50|$|Bone {{and ivory}} being at a {{saltwater}} environment will absorb soluble salts and crystallizes when removed from water {{as the object}} drys. The salt crystallization will make the surface flake and can destroy the object. In some cases when bone and ivory suffer <b>ossein</b> loss due to hydrolysis, it leaves the calcareous substance; the calcareous substance can cause the materials to fossilise and once organic content is lost resulting in crystallisation, quartz can be formed. The soluble salt must be removed to preserve and stabilize the object when removed from the marine environment. Artifacts of these type of material is recommended to remove all the soluble salts {{with the use of}} water.|$|E

5000|$|Bone, {{which has}} a very similar {{chemical}} make-up to ivory, consists of inorganic materials which provide strength and rigidity and organic components that provide the capacity for growth and repair. Unlike ivory which has no marrow or blood vessel system, bone has a spongy central portion of marrow from which extends tiny blood vessels. Bone is also made of both mineral and carbon-based materials; mineral being calcium, phosphorus, and fluoride while the carbon-based being the protein, <b>ossein.</b> [...] Bone comes from many different animals, including mammals, birds, and fish and can come {{in all shapes and}} sizes. It can be used in its natural form, be polished with sand and other abrasives to create a smooth and glossy surface, or can be treated with a burning process which leaves it a blue black to whitish gray color. Bones have been used to create numerous objects throughout history. From tools such as hammers and fishhooks to weapons such spear, arrow, and harpoon points to pendants, hairpins, gaming pieces, musical instruments and ceremonial objects.|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} study on co-digestion of <b>ossein</b> industry waste for methane production Sinews is a pasty proteinaceous by-product discharged from a primary bone clarification tank in the <b>ossein</b> industry, which was mixed with cattle dung in different proportions at ambient temperature. This {{study found that}} a mixture of sinews (40 %) and cattle dung (60 %) was more appropriate for enhanced methane yields with a high efficacy on anaerobic degradation. A maximum cumulative biogas production volume (18 L) with 71 - 77 % methane content was obtained even with more parts of the sinews were used as a substrate. The best biogas production yield was 23. 4 L biogas/Kg TVS added, revealed the suitability of the sinews mixture (40 %) in the biomethanation process. In addition, the pH of each digester was not shifted to alkaline which was constantly maintained within optimal range {{during the course of}} digestion. Perhaps, this alternate strategy will be helpful for managing the odor produced from sinews during bulk storage...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Calcium {{hydroxyapatite}} are non {{organic compound}} {{of the bone}} formed the fracture healing. In fracture healing, {{the parts of the}} compounds make up unordinary scaffold and producing an incredible amount of me- senchymal stem cell under bearing of the scaffold. This study is aimed to determine the effect of hydroxyapatite administration to load failure value in mice with diaphyseal femur fracture. Materials and methods. Research was done using Sprague Dawley rat undergone fracturization of femoral bone and insertion of internal fixation with application of <b>ossein</b> hidroxyapatite compound or aquadest as placebo. Both groups are treated under same condition and on the 8 th week were harvested and put into special jig and was loaded with mechanical compression. The load failure value were noted and analyzed. Results. The p value is 0, 000 which means there is a significant difference among two groups, with the lowest point of load failure value is in the placebo group and the highest is in hydroxyapatite group. Conclusion. <b>Ossein</b> hydroxyapatite compound application results in higher load failure value than placebo in rat with diaphyseal femur fracture...|$|E

The chemical and physical properties of this fraction were studied and compared with those of an acid-soluble collagen prepared from calf skin by conventional techniques. From the results it is concluded that the alkali-soluble protein exhibits only minor differences from acid-soluble collagen, and that these differences can be ascribed for the most part to a decrease in the inter- and intramolecular cross-linking...|$|E
40|$|Hard gelatin {{capsules}} {{are manufactured}} from blends of limed <b>ossein</b> (LOG), acid <b>ossein</b> and acid pigskin gelatins, with LOGS usually forming the main {{portion of the}} blend. Unfortunately, {{the quality of the}} finished capsule cannot be predicted by routine quality control tests and 'poor' batches of LOG are encountered which form unsatisfactory capsules. In addition, differences between gelatin types are encountered in practice but the supporting literature is sparse and conflicting. This work examines some properties of gelatins pertinent to hard capsule manufacture in an attempt to relate these to gelatin type and known performance on capsule machines. Molecular mass distributions (MMD) were examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Each different gelatin type possessed a characteristic shape of MMD which could be related to the source tissue and the treatment undergone during gelatin manufacture. MMDs, isoionic point determinations and an assessment of the content of protein impurities by ultraviolet spectrophotometry failed to resolve differences between 'good' and 'poor' LOG batches. The drying rates of freshly-cast gelatin films were studied under conditions of controlled humidity, temperature and air velocity. No significant differences between gelatin types were observed. Small variations in equilibrium moisture content were seen and were tentatively ascribed to the generation of water binding sites (free carboxyl groups) during gelatin manufacture. The mechanical properties of dry gelatin films were examined by tensile stress-strain and stress-relaxation measurements. Viscoelastic behaviour typical of a polymer in the glass transition region was observed, and significant differences in film fracture strain were observed but these were not related to gelatin type. Optical rotation measurements indicated similar orders of film crystallinity and determinations of frictional characteristics similarly revealed no varietal differences. Overall, few differences related to gelatin type were seen within the properties examined. There was no evidence in these studies to explain the unsatisfactory behaviour of 'poor' LOG batches in capsule manufacture. NB.

40|$|A panel {{painting}} is a painting {{made on a}} wooden panel. It is not well known, {{but a lot of}} famous paintings are actually panel paintings, such as The Mona Lisa by Leonardo Da Vinci, Assunta by Titian, Primavera by Botticelli and Samson and Delilah by Rubens. Artists had clear reasons to choose wood instead of canvas, {{one of the main reasons}} was availability and stability. Before an artist could start his painting he had to prepare the panel with several layers of gesso (mixture of glue, gypsum or sometimes ground chalk and water) <b>ossein</b> (lime made from bones) or other materials. After several layers and considerable sanding, the panel surface became perfectly smooth if properly done. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆ePart 2 discusses the effect of wood moisture changes on deformations. All kind of deformations like cup, twist, bow, etc. (see e. g. figure 8) can be simulated by numerical modelling when taking the wood properties in all directions and the change in properties due to moisture changes into account. Furthermore, for panel paintings, the effect on these deformations of added material like gesso and paint is discussed. The same drying conditions as similar to those considered for the example calculations discussed in part 1 : a step from RH = 70...|$|E
