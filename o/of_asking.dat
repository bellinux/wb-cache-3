5|$|The {{book was}} {{positively}} received by reviewers. The prose {{has been called}} magnificent, lucid, eloquent, and passionate. Lewis' emotional appeal has been called remarkably candid, sincere, powerful, and moving. Connecting the diplomatic and policy-level work of the UN and World Bank with specific effects {{on the ground in}} Africa, and describing the problem of orphans, were among the strengths of the book. Lewis' criticisms are constructive and, since they come from such an ardent multilateralist employed by the United Nations, authoritative. One reviewer questioned several of Lewis' potential solutions as contributing to the same system that consistently fails to address its flaws. The same reviewer identified as the book's weakness its political slant, which ignores corrupt or inefficient African governments and the realities <b>of</b> <b>asking</b> corporations and western governments to take steps against their self-interest, like canceling agricultural subsidies in the case of governments and donating profits in the case of businesses. Several reviewers noted that the book could be used as an effective tool to educate about the HIV/AIDS crisis and the plight of the people of sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
5|$|After toying {{around with}} her brother Alex's guitar, Winehouse bought her own when she was 14 and began writing music a year later. Soon after, she began working for a living, including, at one time, as an {{entertainment}} journalist for the World Entertainment News Network, in addition to singing with local group the Bolsha Band. In July 2000, she became the featured female vocalist with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra; her influences were to include Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington, the latter whom she was already listening to at home. Amy's best friend, soul singer Tyler James, sent her demo tape to an A person. Winehouse signed to Simon Fuller's 19 Management in 2002 and was paid £250 a week against future earnings. While being developed by the management company, she was kept as a recording industry secret although she was a regular jazz standards singer at the Cobden Club. Her future A representative at Island, Darcus Beese, heard of her by accident when the manager of The Lewinson Brothers showed him some productions of his clients, which featured Winehouse as key vocalist. When he asked who the singer was, the manager {{told him he was}} not allowed to say. Having decided that he wanted to sign her, it took several months <b>of</b> <b>asking</b> around for Beese to eventually discover who the singer was. However, Winehouse had already recorded a number of songs and signed a publishing deal with EMI by this time. Incidentally, she formed a working relationship with producer Salaam Remi through these record publishers.|$|E

Mike Newell was appointed as manager, and his side became League One champions in 2004–05. Internal troubles at the club started to intensify {{during the summer of}} 2006, as the club's chairman was revealed by Newell to be making illegal payments to agents—after writing a scathing letter to the board, Newell was sacked in March 2007. Kevin Blackwell was appointed in his stead, but was also sacked {{less than a year later}} on 16 January 2008; former player Mick Harford was made Luton Town's new manager the same day, and he was unable to prevent the club's relegation in 2007–08. After being deducted a total of 30 points by The Football League and The Football Association for 2008–09, Luton were relegated to the Conference Premier; however, the club claimed a Football League Trophy victory during the same season. After two months of the 2009–10 season, Harford left the club by mutual consent, to be replaced a month later by Richard Money. Money's assistant, Gary Brabin, replaced him in March 2011, and managed the club until he was sacked a year later. His replacement, Paul Buckle, took charge in April 2012, and was himself replaced in February 2013 by John Still. Still took Luton back into The Football League in his first full season as manager, breaking a number of club records in the process. Still guided Luton to a comfortable finish in their first season back in League Two, but was sacked by the club in December 2015 following a poor run of form. He was replaced by Nathan Jones in January 2016, who took on his first ever managerial role.|$|E

40|$|Protein kinase ASK 1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1) is {{a member}} of the mitogen- {{activated}} protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP 3 K) family and plays a crucial role in immune and stress responses. Since the increased activity <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 has been linked to the development of several diseases including cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, this enzyme is a promising target for therapeutical intervention in these pathologies. The molecule <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 consists <b>of</b> 1374 amino acid residues, but catalytic activity possesses only a kinase domain located approximately in the middle of the molecule. The activity <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 is regulated by interactions with various proteins including the 14 - 3 - 3 protein. This protein recognizes a phosphorylated motif around Ser 966 at the C-terminus of the catalytic domain <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 1. This binding interaction inhibits ASK 1 through unknown mechanism. ASK 1 under stress conditions, such as oxidative stress, is dephosphorylated at Ser 966 and the 14 - 3 - 3 protein dissociates.

40|$|Previously we {{have shown}} that {{tyrosine}} 718 <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 when phosphorylated is critical for SOCS 1 binding and SOCS 1 -mediated degradation <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 1. However, the kinase and phosphatase responsible for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 at Tyr- 718 are unknown. In this study, we identified JAK 2 and SHP 2 as a Tyr- 718 -specific kinase and phosphatase, respectively. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) induced degradation <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 in normal but not in SOCS 1 -KO endothelial cells (EC). IFN-γ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 at Tyr- 718 was blocked by a JAK 2 -specific inhibitor. IFN-γ enhanced the association between JAK 2 and ASK 1, and the ASK 1 -JAK 2 complex was labile and was stabilized by the proteasomal inhibitor MG 132. Furthermore, JAK 2, but not JAK 1, directly bound to and phosphorylated ASK 1 at Tyr- 718, leading to an enhanced association <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 with SOCS 1 and subsequent ASK 1 degradation. Next, we showed that overexpression of the SH 2 -containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase- 2 (SHP 2) augmented, whereas a phosphatase-inactive mutant of SHP 2 inhibited, TNF-induced ASK 1 dephosphorylation. SHP 2 associated with ASK 1 in response to tumor necrosis factor in EC. An SHP- 2 substrate-trapping mutant formed a complex with tyrosine-phosphorylated ASK 1, suggesting that ASK 1 is a direct SHP 2 substrate. Moreover, SHP 2 wild type, but not a catalytically inactive mutant, dissociated SOCS 1 from ASK 1. IFN-γ-induced ASK 1 Tyr(P) - 718 was enhanced in mouse EC deficient in SHP 2 (SHP 2 -KO). In contrast, tumor necrosis factor-induced dephosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 at Tyr(P) - 718 and activation <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 -JNK signaling, as well as EC apoptosis, are significantly reduced in SHP 2 -KO EC.

40|$|Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase- 1 (ASK 1) is a mitogen-activated protein 3 kinase (MAPKKK/MAP 3 K) {{which lies}} {{upstream}} of the stress-activated MAPKs, JNK and p 38. ASK 1 may be activated {{by a variety}} of extracellular and intracellular stimuli. MAP kinase activation in the sensory nervous system as a result of diabetes has been shown in numerous preclinical and clinical studies. As a common upstream activator of both p 38 and JNK, we hypothesised that activation <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 contributes to nerve dysfunction in diabetic neuropathy. We therefore wanted to characterize the expression <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 in sensory neurons, and determine whether the absence <b>of</b> functional <b>ASK</b> 1 would protect against the development of neuropathy in a mouse model <b>of</b> experimental diabetes. <b>ASK</b> 1 mRNA and protein is constitutively expressed by multiple populations of sensory neurons of the adult mouse lumbar DRG. Diabetes was induced in male C 57 BL/ 6 and transgenic ASK 1 kinase-inactive (ASK 1 n) mice using streptozotocin. Levels <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 do not change in the DRG, spinal cord, or sciatic nerve following induction of diabetes. However, levels <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 2 mRNA increase in the spinal cord at 4 weeks of diabetes, which could represent a future target for this field.

40|$|Abstract Background: Hypertension {{today is}} common {{and a great}} risk factor for {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD). WHO states that more people die annually from CVDs than from any other cause. This project focuses on the regulation of apoptosis signal regulating kinase 3 also known as ASK 3, which has been observed to regulate blood pressure in the kidney. To clarify the regulatory mechanism <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 3 activity {{is important for the}} development of new drugs against hypertension. It has been suggested that transient receptor potential cation channel, mucolipin (TRPML 1), a non selective cation channel, might be the upstream regulator <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 3. Objectives: To investigate whether TRPML 1 is necessary for the regulation <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 3 under hyperosmotic stress through different laboratory techniques. Methods: The research was conducted at The University of Tokyo, laboratory of cell signaling during September to November 2016. To answer the research question many different laboratory technics were used. Such as immunoblotting, immunostaining, immunoflourecense and cell culturing. Results: One of the five experiments supported the hypothesis that TRPML 1 would be the upstream regulator <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 3 under hyper osmotic stress. Another experiments gave negative results, thus one could not draw the conclusion that TRPML 1 is a regulator <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 3. A TRPML 1 KO cell line was also established for further experiment in this field. Conclusion: Three months is not enough to draw any conclusions regarding the regulation <b>of</b> <b>ASK</b> 3 but the results showed some promise.
