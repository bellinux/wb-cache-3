5000|$|Film {{directors}} Brian De Palma, Martin Scorsese, and William Friedkin {{flirted with}} making a <b>Doors</b> biopic over <b>the</b> years. In 1985, Columbia Pictures acquired the rights from <b>the</b> <b>Doors</b> and <b>the</b> Morrison estate <b>to</b> make a film. Producer Sasha Harari wanted filmmaker Oliver Stone <b>to</b> write <b>the</b> screenplay but never heard {{back from his}} agent. After two unsatisfactory scripts were produced, Imagine Films replaced Columbia. Harari contacted Stone again and the director met with the surviving band members. He told them {{he wanted to keep}} a particularly wild scene from one of the early drafts. The group was offended and exercised their right of approval over the director and rejected Stone. By 1989, Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, who owned Carolco Pictures, acquired <b>the</b> rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> project and they wanted Stone <b>to</b> direct it. <b>The</b> <b>Doors</b> had seen Platoon and were impressed with what Stone had done. He agreed to make it after his next project, Evita. After spending years working on it and courting Madonna and Meryl Streep <b>to</b> play <b>the</b> lead role, the film fell apart over salary negotiations with Streep. Stone quickly moved <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Doors</b> and went into pre-production. Guitarist Robby Krieger had always opposed a Doors biopic until Stone signed on to direct. Historically, keyboardist Ray Manzarek had been the biggest advocate of immortalizing the band on film but opposed Stone's involvement. He was not happy with the direction that Stone was going <b>to</b> take with <b>the</b> film and refused to give his approval. According to actor Kyle MacLachlan, [...] "I know that he and Oliver weren't speaking. I think it was hard for Ray, he being the keeper of <b>the</b> <b>Doors</b> myth for so long". According to Krieger, [...] "when <b>the</b> <b>Doors</b> broke up Ray had his idea of how the band should be portrayed and John and I had ours". Manzarek claims that he was not asked <b>to</b> consult on <b>the</b> film and wanted it to be about all four band members equally rather than the focus being on Morrison. Stone claimed that he repeatedly tried to get Manzarek involved, but [...] "all he did was rave and shout. He went on for three hours about his point of view ... I didn't want Ray to be dominant, but Ray thought he knew better than anybody else".|$|R

60|$|I cannot here omit {{one very}} {{remarkable}} Instance of the Catholick Zeal of that Prince, which I was soon after an Eye-witness of.

On Sight of the Host the King came out of his Coach, kneel'd down in the Street, which at that time prov'd to be very dirty, till the Host pass'd by; then rose up, and taking the lighted Flambeau from him who bore it, he follow'd the Priest up a streight nasty Alley, and there up a dark ordinary Pair of Stairs, where the poor sick Woman lay. There he stay'd till the whole Ceremony was <b>over,</b> when, returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Door</b> of <b>the</b> Church, he very faithfully restor'd <b>the</b> lighted Flambeau <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fellow he had taken it from, the People all the while crying out Viva, Viva; an Acclamation, we may imagine, intended to his Zeal, as well as his Person.|$|R
5000|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} uses the radio edit without intro. The video {{begins with the}} girls in their respective apartments, watching television. While Brandy watches an episode of The Jerry Springer Show, whose title {{is that of the}} song, Monica accidentally turns Brandy's TV to a romantic movie, in which Monica is watching her own TV set. Whenever Brandy or Monica turns the channel, the other's TV stays on that channel and they grow sick of it. They then give up and start <b>to</b> sing. <b>The</b> next scene shows Brandy and Monica discussing their problem with their separate groups of friends. The [...] "boy" [...] himself (played by Phifer) then appears outside the two girls' apartments, where all their friends walk by him as they exit their respective friend's place. The girls are wearing pyjamas in the next scene, and then each one calls <b>the</b> boy <b>over</b> <b>to</b> choose who he wants to be with. After Brandy and Monica fight with words, <b>the</b> boy comes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> apartment, frustrated <b>over</b> whom <b>to</b> choose. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> opens, and only Brandy is shown. Then it swings a little wider to reveal Monica as well. The boy is surprised and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is slammed in his face.|$|R
60|$|The {{men were}} engaged now in talking over the deeds {{in which they}} had been engaged, and so revolting and cold-blooded were the atrocities of which they boasted that I longed for the time when Rube and I should fall upon them.

I found my hands were completely numbed, and {{it was a long time}} before I could restore the circulation. It must have been a good half-hour before Rube gave the signal that he had got the cords that bound his ankles loosened, as of course he could not begin at them until he had the free use of his hands. As I had anticipated, the visits of our guards were rather less frequent now that they believed us to be asleep. Fortunately, the din and talk in the next room was now loud and incessant, which enabled Rube to rub, and even stamp his feet a little. In half an hour I heard a snore, which I answered. The moment the next visit was <b>over</b> I crawled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and then, lying pretty nigh on my stomach, crept round <b>to</b> where <b>the</b> rifles were piled.|$|R

40|$|One {{night my}} wife and I were on the road, staying in a hotel in I-don 2 ̆ 7 t-remember-where. I {{woke up in the}} middle of <b>the</b> night <b>to</b> find said wife missing. Happily, I saw a light under <b>the</b> {{bathroom}} <b>door.</b> There she is, I thought. I fell back asleep. I woke up again sometime later. It was still the middle of the night and that light was still on. Hmm [...] What 2 ̆ 7 s up with that? I wonder if she 2 ̆ 7 s okay? I should check.

An American Journey from Ellis Island <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Great War (HarperCollins, 2010) —I jumped at <b>the</b> chance <b>to</b> read it and get him on the show. The book tells the stories of twelve Americans who immigrated from Europe <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US around 1900 and then returned to Europe <b>to</b> fight in <b>the</b> Great War for their newly-adopted country. It 2 ̆ 7 s a tale of poverty, hope, escape, new beginnings, disappointments, hard work (for low pay), patriotism, bravery, suffering, death and redemption all told in wonderfully crafted prose. Through the lives of these men and their families David allows us to witness 2 ̆ 2 ethnics 2 ̆ 2 (as they were called) adopting an American identity, and often at a heavy price. They literally fought for <b>the</b> right <b>to</b> be Americans. For those of us born in freedom, their bravery is a reminder of what freedom is worth.

5000|$|By {{the start}} of 1943 {{there was a large}} number of Finns in the camp, many of whom were of a sort that was [...] "often homeless, {{semi-literate}} and semi-vagabond." [...] Their section of the camp had become a rough and dangerous place where violence often broke out. This was not helped {{by the fact that they}} would increase the potency of <b>the</b> alcohol allowed <b>to</b> them by adding the likes of hair oil, boot-blacking and wood polish <b>to</b> it. <b>The</b> raucous and dangerous activities of the camp increased around the date of Hitler’s birthday on 20 April, at which point the canteen was looted of all of its alcohol, which only increased the drunkenness and violence. On the morning of 20 April a 26-year-old Finnish man carried a bucket of dirty water from his own house <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house next <b>door,</b> where he threw it over the face of a man who had been standing there by <b>the</b> entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house. After a moment of shock this 36-year-old man pulled a knife from his pocket and stabbed the younger man in the chest. The knife penetrated the man’s heart and he died moments later having staggered back <b>to</b> fall on <b>the</b> pavement outside his own house. A mob then formed which proceeded <b>to</b> severely beat <b>the</b> older man, but he was able to escape too serious harm because he was able to run out into the protection of the guards when they opened the gates in order to enter <b>to</b> stem <b>the</b> disturbance. In the civil trial that followed, the man was found not guilty of either murder or manslaughter, as it was held that his life was in danger and so the knifing was carried out in self-defence. The man was then returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp.|$|R
