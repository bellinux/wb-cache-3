Artificial neural network analysis is used to analyse {{the content of the}} bylaws of six open source foundations (Apache, Eclipse, GNOME, Plone, Python, and SPI) for the purpose of identifying power structures. Results of the research suggest that: i) the actions of an <b>open</b> source <b>software</b> <b>foundation</b> are centered around one of three groups: Members, Chairman/President/Executive Director, and Board of Directors; ii) in only one of the six foundations is the Board of Directors responsible for both the community and the product; and iii) artificial neural network analysis of the content of bylaws provides unbiased insights of the power structure of <b>open</b> source <b>software</b> <b>foundations.</b> These results may prove useful to those who contribute to open source foundations and use their products and services...|$|R

40|$|Communities {{that develop}} <b>open</b> source <b>software</b> (OSS) are virtual {{entities}} on the Internet, not legal entities. Some open source communities establish <b>open</b> source <b>software</b> <b>foundations</b> (OSSF) {{in order to}} protect their intellectual property and carry out contractual arrangements. As legal entities, OSSF help communities attain their long-term goals, hold community assets, provide resources to communities, and balance interests amongst different stakeholders. When OSS started to draw more business interests, commercial companies became involved with open source communities. The emergence of OSSF provides a good platform and opportunities for companies to exert their influence in a more official way.
