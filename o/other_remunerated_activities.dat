40|$|Abstract Objective: to {{determine}} {{the quality of life}} in the workplace for nursing staff at public institutions in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. Method: quantitative, correlational, cross-sectional, and comparative. We used a probabilistic sample of 345 nurses with data collected in 2013 using an instrument created by the authors to gather bio-socio-demographic data and the CVT-GOHISALO instrument with a Cronbach's alpha of 0. 95. SPSS 15 was used to analyze the data. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to calculate the normality of the data; the medians were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test with the significance level set at 0. 05. Results: the average overall quality of life in the workplace for nursing staff was 207. 31 (DE 41. 74), indicating a moderate level. The quality of life in the workplace was higher for people with permanent contracts (p= 0. 007) who did not engage in other remunerative activities (p= 0. 046). Differences in {{the quality of life in}} the workplace were observed depending on the institution where the subjects worked (p= 0. 001). Conclusion: the nursing staff perceives itself as having a moderate-level quality of life in the workplace. This level was determined in the statistical analysis based on the type of contract, whether the person performed <b>other</b> <b>remunerated</b> <b>activities,</b> and the institution where the person worked...|$|E

Public transport {{operations are}} non-scheduled, on-demand services flying between points specified by the customer, providing a more flexible service than airline travel. Air taxi operations offer charter services for third parties, and business or corporate aviation uses company-owned aircraft to transport employees and clients. Aircraft used in these operations include business jets, helicopters, and twin piston-engine aeroplanes carrying between six and ten people. An example {{of this type of}} operation is the transport by helicopter of spectators to the British Formula One grand prix at Silverstone. This involves so many flights that, according to Cranfield Aviation Services, on race day the heliport is temporarily the world's busiest airport.

That saving would enable women to engage in <b>remunerated</b> <b>activities,</b> dedicate more time to pursuing education, or have a little leisure. In this One Pager, we investigate the impact of water provision on women’s time allocation in rural Ghana. Thus far the literature has presented little empirical evidence on the subject. One example is Ilahi and Grimard (2000), who show that poor access to water in rural Pakistan reduces the time that women devote to market-oriented activities and increases women’s total work burden. Coulombe and Wodon (2008) found that access to infrastructure does not significantly affect {{the total number of}} hours women work in Ghana. But they suggest that the time saved from domestic work as a result of infrastructure provision might be used for <b>remunerated</b> <b>activities.</b> To contribute to this debate, we use data from the Ghana Living Standards Survey, Round Four (1998 – 1999). We analyse a sample of 2, 858 women between 25 and 59 years old living in 190 rural communities. Four models are estimated to identify the determinants of the time women allocate to fetching water, domestic work, market work and total work.

Data collection were performed with questionnaires in fieldwork (primary sources) and bibliographic searches and surveys (secondary sources). The sample consisted of horses breeders in Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul State, and in Argentina. The questionnaire was based on the Brazilian Study of Horse Agribusiness Complex, divided into: Production Aspects, Health Issues and trade aspects. Descriptive data analysis and relative frequencies were compared using the chi-square (&# 967; 2) test at 5 % probability. It was observed that there was a similarity in several aspects related to the breeding and trade horse agribusiness, whereas in the health aspects there was asymmetry in certain aspects. In the Southern Brazil, 29. 0 % of the owners live in the breeding farm and 67. 7 % have another <b>remunerated</b> <b>activity.</b> There was a similarity in the endoparasites system control and an asymmetry in the ectoparasites control. There was a higher percentage of diseases control in Argentina, which may be related to technification and qualification of workforce. However, regarding the equine sanitary control, there was a similarity between the farms of Southern Brazil and Argentina. Despite of all asymmetries and similarities, there is a relevance of horse agribusiness on generating jobs and income source, as well as the cultural and economic contribution in both countries. Furthermore, there is a necessity of public policies from government authority to promote the horse industry...|$|R

It was adopted as a theoric methodological referential the Social Representation Theories proposed by Moscovici and by the Theory of the Central Nucleus elaborated by Jean-Claude Abric, in the Social Psychology perspective. Data were obtained by the use of two questionnaires. The first wanted to know the socio-demographic profile of these students, while the second, based on the free evocation technique, wanted to learn the social representation due to the induction term being a nurse. 430 students constituted the sample, distributed between the 1 st and 6 th periods of the nursing courses of the mentioned institutions, what consisted of 45, 6 % of the total population. The profile description of these students were analyzed by simple attendance, and the structures obtained by free evocations were processed by the software Ensemble de Programmes Permettant des Evocations (EVOC) and analyzed by the four house board technique created by Pierre Vergès. There was a major of young, female, single, and coming from public schools students.

Little did she understand the artifices of the selfish and calculating, one of the most familiar of their frauds being to conceal from the skillful their own success, lest it should command a price in proportion to its claims. The milliner heard Adrienne's lady-like and gentle remonstrance with alarm, and she felt that she was in danger of losing a prize.

Her practiced policy, as well as her selfishness, counseled her to try the latter expedient first.|$|R

40|$|Civic {{activists have}} worked to embed {{community}} institutions in the Phoenix area {{from the time of}} initial Anglo settlement in the Salt River valley. Civic elites sought to monopolize control over regional development via municipal governance in the period after the Second World War. This dissertation places qualitative sources on community life in conversation with quantitative sources on political economy to explain how civic elites, as manifest in the civic organization of Charter government, worked with suburban activists to maintain spatial racialization in Phoenix. This process reveals that the socio-political value of civic life has waned in metropolitan Phoenix after the political ascent of Charter government. The outcome of this change is that marginalized Anglo communities like Maryvale, the first master-planned community built in Phoenix after World War II, were consumed by racial transition once local civic activists lost control over neighborhood economies. John F. Long began to construct Maryvale atop cotton and cantaloupe fields on the rural periphery of metropolitan Phoenix in the mid-fifties. The sweat equity of civic participation helped Long provide residents with access to affordable community amenities. He hoped that annexation into Phoenix would benefit Maryvale, but continued political marginalization hindered local efforts to provide civic services, like community healthcare, without burdensome debt. Soon, political engagement declined and outside investors acquired operational ownership of civic institutions; moreover, the social capital which traditionally <b>remunerated</b> civic <b>activity</b> declined in value as racial minorities challenged Anglo hegemony over local civic life. By the late seventies, when racial tensions among local youth boiled over into overt violence, civic leaders lacked the social capital to ameliorate racial conflict, and Anglos abdicated civic authority to law enforcement to pacify hostilities. This shift in community praxis, from civic participation to private consumption, transformed local patterns of racial integration into regional patterns of social segregation. ...|$|R

The World Tourist Organization defines tourism as {{activities}} of people who "travel to and stay in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes {{not related to the}} exercise of an <b>activity</b> <b>remunerated</b> from within the place visited". Tourism in Poland dates back to the beginnings of the previous millennium. One of the earliest and well documented tourist trips in Poland was that made by Beata Łaska with her servants to the Tatra Mountains in 1563. The first rafting on the Dunajec River was organized in 1839. The foundations for the Polish tourism were laid by many persons, representatives of different social groups, among them Stanisław Staszic, Mieczysław Karłowicz, Tytus Chałubiński, Wincenty Pol, Oskar Kolberg, Stefan Żeromski. Towarzystwo Tatrzańskie (The Tatra Society), established in 1873 (1872 ?) is considered the first Polish tourist and sight-seeing organization. In the following years many tourist organizations were founded in different regions of Poland, among them the Polskie Towarzystwo Krajoznawcze (The Polish Sight-Seeing Society), Akademicki Klub Turystyczny (Academic Tourist Club), Poznańskie Towarzystwo Turystyczne (Poznań Tourist Society), Liga Popierania Turystyki (Tourist Support League). The largest tourist organization in Poland is Polskie Towarzystwo Turystyczno-Krajoznawcze (The Polish Tourist and Sight-Seeing Society), which was reestablished in 1950. Its main mission is promotion of tourism and sight-seeing, expression of love for one's home country through trips and travels around it, protection of historical monuments and nature (Photo 1 - 3). There were many organizations and enterprises, which organized tourist, activities as part of their regular operations.

O primeiro ano de vida, perÃodo mais vulnerÃvel aos agravos de qualquer natureza, parece ser a fase mais crÃtica para os efeitos desta condiÃÃo. Objetivos: Verificar que fatores ou condiÃÃes poderiam determinar maior risco de morbidade em crianÃas com menos de um ano, de mÃes adolescentes. Metodologia: Estudo transversal, desenvolvido entre marÃo de 2001 e marÃo de 2002, no NÃcleo de AtenÃÃo Medica Integrada, UNIFOR e no Hospital Infantil Albert Sabin. As variÃveis do estudo contemplam as mÃes e as crianÃas abordando aspectos comportamentais, sociais, econÃmicos, demogrÃficos e biolÃgicos. Resultados: Foram estudadas 296 mÃes com idades entre 14 e 19 anos e seus filhos menores de 12 meses, matriculados nos referidos serviÃos. A mÃdia de escolaridade das mÃes foi de 6, 5 anos e 8, 1 % exerciam atividade trabalhista remunerada. NÃo houve associaÃÃo significativa entre doenÃa nas crianÃas e escolaridade da mÃe (p> 0, 05). A renda familiar foi de 01 SM, em 75, 5 % dos casos. Um nÃmero significativo de mÃes (65, 2 %) preferia ter esperado mais tempo para engravidar e 19, 5 % tentaram o aborto. NÃo houve associaÃÃo significativa entre doenÃa nas crianÃas e essas variÃveis estudadas. Das mÃes com atÃ 16 anos, 17, 7 % tiveram filhos com PN igual ou menor que 2500 g e das maiores de 16, 13, 0 % tambÃm os tiveram (p> 0, 05). Analisadas isoladamente, mÃes mais jovens geraram filhos com peso menor que mÃes mais velhas, apesar de nÃo ser baixo peso (p 16 anos) cuidam mais que as mais jovens (14 - 16 anos) (p 0, 05). A idade mÃdia das crianÃas foi de 3, 5 meses e 99, 2 % tinham CartÃo da CrianÃa. Foi considerada boa a cobertura vacinal. A duraÃÃo mÃdia do aleitamento exclusivo foi de 117 dias e 180 dias para alimentaÃÃo mista. VÃ-se associaÃÃo estatisticamente significativa entre nÃo mamar e adoecer (p 0, 05).

Introduction: The immediate repercussions {{of a teenage}} motherhood, both on the women and their children, are widely addressed in the literature. However, {{it is not clear}} which are the medium and long-term effects the teenage and low income status of the mothers have on their offspring. The first year of life, the most vulnerable period in life to aggressions of any kind, seems to be the most critical stage for the effects of such conditions to appear. Objective: Verify which factors or conditions could determine a higher morbidity risk in children under one year of age. Methodology: Transversal-type study, carried out between March 2001 and March 2002 at the Integrated Medical Care Center (NÃcleo de AtenÃÃo MÃdica Integrada), Fortaleza University, and at the Albert Sabin Hospital for Children (Hospital Infantil Albert Sabin - HIAS). The study variables contemplate the mothers and children approaching behaviors, social, economics, demographic and biological aspects. Results: 296 mothers were studied, with ages ranging between 14 - 19 years, and their not older than one year children, all of them registered at the above mentioned healthcare services. The mothersâ average school-attending time was 6, 5 years, and 8, 1 % of them performed a <b>remunerated</b> <b>activity.</b> There was no significant association between child disease and the motherâs literacy level (p> 0, 05).
