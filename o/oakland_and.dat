5|$|Interstate 680 (I-680) is a north–south Interstate Highway in Northern California. It curves {{around the}} eastern {{cities of the}} San Francisco Bay Area from San Jose to Interstate 80 at Fairfield, {{bypassing}} cities along {{the eastern shore of}} San Francisco Bay such as <b>Oakland</b> <b>and</b> Richmond while serving others more inland such as Pleasanton and Concord.|$|E
5|$|By 1872, the {{railroad}} had extended from Portland to Roseburg. Along the way, it created growth in Willamette Valley {{towns such as}} Canby, Aurora, and Harrisburg, which emerged as freight and passenger stations, and provided a commercial lifeline to {{the part of the}} river valley above Harrisburg where steamships were rarely able to travel. As {{the railroad}} made its way into the Umpqua Valley, new townsites such as Drain, <b>Oakland,</b> <b>and</b> Yoncalla were laid out.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, BART {{had envisioned}} {{frequent}} local service, with headways {{as short as}} two minutes between trains on the quadruple-interlined section in San Francisco and six minutes on each individual line. However, headways have fallen short of the original plans. While trains do arrive every three minutes on the quadruple-interlined section between West <b>Oakland</b> <b>and</b> Daly City during weekday commute hours, each individual line operates at 15 minute intervals.|$|E
5|$|Proposals {{to simplify}} the fare {{structure}} abound. A flat fare that disregards distance has been proposed, or simpler fare bands or zones. Either scheme would shift the fare-box recovery burden to the urban riders in San Francisco, <b>Oakland</b> <b>and</b> Berkeley and away from suburban riders in East Contra Costa, Southern Alameda, and San Mateo Counties, where density is lowest, and consequently, operational cost is highest.|$|E

5|$|Stations in {{the urban}} cores of San Francisco, <b>Oakland,</b> <b>and</b> Berkeley have the highest ridership, while {{suburban}} stations record lower rider numbers. During fiscal year 2017, the busiest station was Embarcadero with 48,526 average weekday exits, followed by Montgomery Street with 45,386. The busiest station outside of San Francisco was 12th Street Oakland City Center with 13,965 riders, followed by 19th Street Oakland with 13,456. The least busy station was Oakland International Airport with 1,517 riders, while the least busy standard BART station was North Concord / Martinez with 2,702 weekday exits.|$|E
5|$|The road {{has long}} {{served as a}} de facto {{cultural}} dividing line between the predominantly poor black city and its wealthier, predominantly white northern suburbs. The perception of 8Mile as the chief dividing line between racial groups and classes persists, {{in part because the}} suburban counties of <b>Oakland</b> <b>and</b> Macomb remain, on the whole, significantly whiter and more prosperous than the city of Detroit. However, in recent years increasing numbers of whites have moved into Detroit, especially around the downtown area, and other neighborhoods in the region have become more ethnically diverse as well.|$|E

5|$|Continuing east, M-102 intersects M-39 (Southfield Freeway) and M-10 (Lodge Freeway) {{south of}} the Southfield campus of Oakland Community College and the Northland Center Mall. As the highway {{approaches}} M-1 (Woodward Avenue), there are a pair of service drives that split from the main roadway in each direction to provide access through the interchange with M-1. The main lanes of M-102 pass under M-1 and its ramp connections before the service drives merge back in on the other side. This interchange is located adjacent to the Michigan State Fairgrounds, former site of the now-defunct Michigan State Fair, and Woodlawn Cemetery. East of the fairgrounds, the highway crosses a line of the Canadian National Railway that also carries Amtrak passenger traffic; the line is south of a rail terminal in Ferndale. Further east, M-102 meets I-75 before intersecting Dequindre Road. Dequindre is the boundary between <b>Oakland</b> <b>and</b> Macomb counties.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Rangers {{governor}} William Jennings {{introduced to}} his peers {{the idea of}} expanding the league to the American West Coast by adding two new teams for the 1964–65 season. While the governors did not agree to the proposal, the topic of expansion came up every time the owners met from then on out. In 1965, {{it was decided to}} expand by six teams, doubling the size of the NHL. In February 1966, the governors met and decided to award franchises to Los Angeles, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, <b>Oakland</b> <b>and</b> St. Louis. The league rejected bids from Baltimore, Buffalo and Vancouver. In Canada, there was widespread outrage over the denial of an expansion team to Vancouver in 1967; three years later, the NHL awarded a franchise to Vancouver, which formerly played in the Western Hockey League, for the 1970–71 season, along with the Buffalo Sabres.|$|E
5|$|In Alameda County, {{the freeway}} {{begins in the}} city of Fremont, where it intersects SR 262, which was {{unsigned}} until 2000. Continuing through the city, it meets Mission Boulevard at SR 238 before exiting the city. Prior to 2002, two ghost ramps existed here, remains of an abandoned freeway project replacing Mission Blvd. Amid Alameda County, it abruptly turns northeastward and enters a hilly area, where it crosses over Mission Pass, and descends into the Sunol Valley, where it runs concurrently with SR 84 for a short while. Afterwards, it enters Pleasanton and intersects with I-580, currently California's longest auxiliary interstate providing access to <b>Oakland</b> <b>and</b> the Central Valley. It enters Dublin for a short segment before exiting the county and entering Contra Costa County.|$|E

5|$|Mondays through Saturdays, BART trains run on five routes; {{four are}} transbay routes {{connecting}} San Francisco to <b>Oakland</b> <b>and</b> various destinations in the East Bay, while the fifth, the Richmond–Warm Springs line, runs {{exclusively in the}} East Bay. Two of the five routes do not run on nights and weekends, and one is truncated on Saturdays, but all stations remain accessible by transfers via other routes. In September 1972 BART's first route opened: Fremont to MacArthur, extended to Richmond in January 1973. Concord to MacArthur started in May 1973 and Montgomery Street to Daly City began in November 1973. The original system was completed in September 1974 when trains first carried passengers through the underwater Transbay Tube. BART's three routes then were Concord–Daly City, Fremont-Daly City and Richmond–Fremont.|$|E

The threat claimed that the attack would be carried out on October 22, {{the final day of}} the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Both the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security expressed doubt concerning the credibility of the threats, but warned the relevant organizations as a precaution. The games proceeded as planned but under a higher level of security awareness. The threats came to light in the national media after Jake Brahm admitted to having posted the threats on 4chan and repeating them on other websites approximately 40 times.|$|E
