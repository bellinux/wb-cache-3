Gold travels to Coast City, but US soldiers attack him mistaking him to be an Atlantean threat. Skeets is damaged when Gold is attacked by the military's Project Six, which is revealed to be Doomsday.|$|E
25|$|Visual memory, in an {{academic}} environment, entails work with pictures, symbols, numbers, letters, and especially words. Students {{must be able to}} look at a word, form an image of that word in their minds and be able to recall the appearance of the word later. When teachers introduce a new vocabulary word, generally they write it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard,</b> have the children spell it, read it and then use it in a sentence. The word is then erased from the chalkboard. Students with good visual memory will recognize that same word later in their readers or other texts and will be able to recall the appearance of the word to spell it.|$|E
500|$|All of {{this does}} little to endear Elphaba to Galinda and the feeling is mutual ("What is this Feeling?"). They clash constantly, even in their classes, such as their history class with Dr. Dillamond. Dr. Dillamond is the only Animal {{professor}} at the university and is beginning to suffer from discrimination, even from the students, which is shown when someone writes [...] "Animals should be seen and not heard" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard.</b> He tells Elphaba that there is a conspiracy to stop the Animals from speaking, and she wants to let the Wizard know, for he would surely stop it ("Something Bad").|$|E
50|$|Several mathematicians work as {{consultants}} {{for each}} episode. Actual mathematics {{is presented in}} the show; <b>the</b> equations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chalkboards</b> are mathematically valid, and are somewhat applicable to the situations presented in each show. This mathematical validity and applicability of the equations has been asserted by professional mathematicians.|$|R
50|$|In {{the same}} vein as Shinbo's {{previous}} series, Pani Poni Dash!, the anime features a plethora of parodies and references to popular culture, many of which appear seemingly randomly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chalkboards</b> in classroom scenes. Abundant eyecatches and light-hearted omake shorts {{at the end of}} each episode are also of a generally parodic nature. The use of parodies adds to an already plentiful use of humor into the series.|$|R
5000|$|An infuriated Mr. Krupp {{puts them}} on {{permanent}} detention {{for the rest}} of the school year, threatening the two boys that they will be suspended if they leave the detention room once for any reason. George and Harold get assigned writing lines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chalkboards</b> in <b>the</b> detention room every day for two hours after school. With each boy using a quick line-writing device (a series of joined poles with pieces of chalk in them) they are able to write all their lines in 3 ½ minutes.|$|R
500|$|This was {{the first}} new episode to air {{following}} the release of The Simpsons Movie, and the episode's opening sequence is a callback to the film. Bart writes [...] "I will not wait 20 years to make another movie" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard</b> and skateboards through Springfield, which is still recovering from the dome incident. Several movie characters reappear, including president Schwarzenegger, the Multi-Eyed Squirrel, Colin, Russ Cargill, and the Medicine Woman. We also see that the Simpsons house is still under construction and the silo is strapped to Homer's car. Plopper the pig is also featured {{for the first time}} in the series, during the couch gag and Homer refers to him as [...] "my summer love." ...|$|E
500|$|Mulder {{arrives at}} the school, where Scully claims that she never called him. They find Mrs. Paddock {{seemingly}} attacked by the remaining faculty members, and go to search for them. The faculty members capture the two agents, convinced {{that they need to}} perform a sacrifice to regain favor with the Devil and make up for their diluted faith before it is too late. As they are about to kill Mulder and Scully, Mrs. Paddock causes them to instead kill themselves, confirming that their attempt was indeed too late. The agents escape their bonds and find Mrs. Paddock missing, with only a parting message <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard</b> stating, [...] "Goodbye. It's been nice working with you." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the opening}} sequence, Bart {{originally}} wrote [...] "butt.com" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard,</b> however, it was modified to butt.butt, due to butt.com being a real website. The storyline of famous celebrities moving to Springfield was pitched by Mike Scully; Scully originally pitched Bruce Springsteen as the celebrity {{to move to}} town, however, Springsteen turned down the opportunity to appear. Richard Appel then offered the guest appearance opportunity to Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, but they too turned down the offer. Appel then offered Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger the opportunity to provide their voices, and they agreed to guest star in the episode. The episode was originally intended to be directed by Mike B. Anderson, but it was held over from season 9 and Pete Michels directed it.|$|E
50|$|The camera zooms {{in through}} the town and then through a window of a {{lavender}} Springfield Elementary, where Bart is writing lines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> class <b>chalkboard</b> as a punishment.

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things <b>on</b> <b>the</b> school <b>chalkboard,</b> Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> couch.|$|R
500|$|Groening {{developed}} a lengthy opening sequence {{to cut down}} on the animation necessary for each episode, but devised two gags as compensation for the repeated material each week. In the first gag, the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School, where Bart can be seen writing a message <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard.</b> This message, which changes from episode to episode, has become known as the [...] "chalkboard gag". The other gag is known as a [...] "couch gag", in which a twist of events occur when the family meets to sit on their couch and watch television. Groening, who had not paid much attention to television since childhood, was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time. The theme, which plays over the sequence, was composed by Danny Elfman in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a [...] "retro-style" [...] theme. The piece, which took two days to create, has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.|$|E
500|$|The Wolverines {{were the}} {{unanimous}} pre-season Number 1 pick in 1981 but lost their opener to Wisconsin 2114. In the team meeting the next day, Schembechler {{walked into the}} room and wrote [...] "Ed Muransky" [...] and [...] "Stan Edwards" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard,</b> and then barked out, [...] "The rest of you are quitters. I want nothing more to do with you," [...] and left. According to the coach, Muransky and Edwards were the only two who played with intensity against Wisconsin, and Bo left it to them to motivate the rest of the team. Muransky issued a challenge to the offense on the night before the following week's game: [...] "I looked at everyone and said, 'If we continue to play as great individuals, we'll continue to lose. If we start to play as a great team, we'll start winning." [...] The next day, the Wolverines beat #1 ranked Notre Dame, 257.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} the first to feature the series' full title sequence. Creator Matt Groening {{developed}} the lengthy sequence in order {{to cut down on the}} animation necessary for each episode, but devised the two gags as compensation for the repeated material each week. In the first gag, the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School, where Bart can be seen writing a message <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard.</b> This message, which changes from episode to episode, has become known as the [...] "chalkboard gag". The other gag is known as a [...] "couch gag", in which a twist of events occur when the family meets to sit on their couch and watch television. Groening, who had not paid much attention to television since his own childhood, was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time. As the finished episodes became longer, the production team were reluctant to cut the stories in order to allow for the long title sequence, so shorter versions of it were developed. The episode also introduced the characters Martin Prince and his parents, Richard, Bart's teacher Edna Krabappel and Dr. J Loren Pryor.|$|E
500|$|Approximately {{the first}} half-minute {{of the opening}} {{sequence}} remains the same, with a few oddities: the word [...] "Banksy" [...] is sprayed onto a number of walls and other public spaces; Krusty's billboard advertises that he now performs at funerals (first seen on [...] "Take My Life, Please", but this had [...] "Banksy" [...] <b>on</b> it). <b>The</b> <b>chalkboard</b> gag ("I must not write all over the walls") is written all over the classroom walls, clock, door, and floor.|$|R

500|$|In {{the opening}} {{sequence}} of many Simpsons episodes, the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School, where Bart {{can be seen}} writing a message <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard.</b> This message, which changes from episode to episode, {{has become known as}} the [...] "chalkboard gag". Chalkboard messages may involve political humor such as [...] "The First Amendment does not cover burping", pop culture references such as [...] "I can't see dead people", and meta-references such as [...] "I am not a 32 year old woman" [...] and [...] "Nobody reads these anymore". The animators are able to produce the chalkboard gags quickly and in some cases have changed them to fit current events. For example, the chalkboard gag for [...] "Homer the Heretic" [...] (season four, 1992) read, [...] "I will not defame New Orleans." [...] The gag had been written as an apology to the city for a controversial song in the previous week's episode, [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge", which called the city a [...] "home of pirates, drunks and whores". Many episodes do not feature a chalkboard gag because a shorter opening title sequence, where the chalkboard gags are cut, is used to make more room for story and plot development.|$|E
500|$|The name of {{the episode}} comes from the slogan in a {{political}} advert used in Herbert Hoover's presidential campaign in 1928, [...] "A Chicken In Every Pot", which the advert later amplifies with [...] "And a car in every backyard, to boot.". Several parts of the episode are inspired by the 1941 film Citizen Kane, all with Mr. Burns {{in the role of}} Charles Foster Kane. The campaign rally scene where Burns speaks in front of a giant poster of himself is a reference to a scene from that film. The scene where Burns trashes the Simpson family's dining room after the dinner is similar to the scene in which Kane destroys his ex-wife's room. Mary Bailey shares her name with George Bailey's wife in the 1946 film It's a Wonderful Life. Burns hires an actor to portray the nineteenth-century scientist Charles Darwin [...] to help in his claim that the three-eyed fish was the result of evolution. Darwin was a naturalist who presented compelling evidence that all species of life have evolved over time from common ancestors, through the process he called natural selection. The clip of Burns driving a military tank in his campaign montage is similar to a clip featured in Michael Dukakis's 1988 United States presidential campaign, in which he can be seen driving a tank. A re-run of the episode that aired on June 25, 1992, included a new chalkboard gag in the opening credits that featured Bart writing [...] "It's potato, not potatoe" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chalkboard.</b> This is a reference to a spelling blunder by the then-Vice President of the United States Dan Quayle, who corrected a student's correct spelling of [...] "potato" [...] to [...] "potatoe" [...] at an elementary school spelling bee in Trenton, New Jersey, on June 15, 1992.|$|E

Other [...] "Special" [...] burgers are also mentioned by the family without being written <b>on</b> their <b>chalkboard.</b> <b>The</b> joke is often that <b>the</b> play <b>on</b> words is overly complex or obscure.|$|R
