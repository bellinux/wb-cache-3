2500|$|Because of {{the high}} {{circulation}} of air through the chamber, the total concentration of oxygen in the chamber never exceeds 25% as this can {{increase the risk of}} fire. [...] Oxygen is never fed directly into soft chambers but is rather introduced via a line and mask directly to the patient. FDA approved <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> for human consumption in confined areas used for HBOT are regularly monitored for purity (+/- 1%) and flow (10 to 15 liters per minute outflow pressure). An audible alarm will sound if the purity ever drops below 80%. [...] Personal hyperbaric chambers use 120 volt or 220 volt outlets.

2500|$|UV ozone {{generators}} use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or oxygen concentrator), therefore these generators {{tend to be}} less expensive. [...] However UV {{ozone generators}} usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air sterilization, for example). Production of ozone is one of the potential dangers of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pool and spa applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air driers or <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> which require extra costs and maintenance.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of patients, mainly COPD and overlap-syndrome patients, simultaneously use home oxygen therapy and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) at night. Usually the oxygen source is a stationary concentrator. We report a patient who, without a medical recommendation, was using a portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator</b> during nocturnal NIV. In the laboratory, with the patient, we tested the portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator’s</b> triggering and <b>oxygen</b> delivery, with the supplemental oxygen connected at 3 different positions: near the ventilator, near the exhalation valve, and on the nasal mask port. We also tested the concentrator’s triggering capacity by placing the nasal prongs and the nasal mask independently. We tested ventilator inspiratory pressures of 10, 14, and 18 cm H 2 O, and expiratory pressures of 4 and 6 cm H 2 O.

30|$|Introduction Oxygen {{therapy is}} an {{essential}} issue for the French Military Health Service (FMHS). Wounded soldiers are severe trauma patients often burnt and suffering from haemorrhagic shock. They need all along their management oxygen therapy. The theatres of external operations are isolated with limited resources. Their supply is difficult. Currently, 50 % of the trauma are intubated. Thirty-three percent of the patient admitted in intensive care suffers from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The FMHS chose <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator</b> as <b>oxygen</b> source in addition to oxygen pressurized bottles. Their supply can be uncertain in conflict areas. Insufficient data are available concerning the use of <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator</b> in intensive care unit.|$|R
50|$|Industrial <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as oxygen generators within the oxygen and ozone industries to distinguish them from medical <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators.</b> The distinction is used in an attempt to clarify that industrial <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> are not medical devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and they are not suitable for use as bedside medical concentrators. However, applying the oxygen generator nomenclature can lead to confusion. The term, oxygen generator, is a misnomer in that the oxygen is not generated as it is with a chemical oxygen generator, but rather it is concentrated from the air.|$|E
50|$|The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has {{approved}} {{the use of}} portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> on commercial airlines. However, users of these devices should check in advance as to whether a particular brand or model is permitted on a particular airline. Unlike in commercial airlines, users of aircraft without cabin pressurization need <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> which are able to deliver enough flowrate even at high altitudes, such as OXYFLY.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the process}} used in medical <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrators</b> used by {{emphysema}} patients and others requiring oxygen-enriched air for breathing.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the current}} {{portable}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator</b> systems provide <b>oxygen</b> on a pulse (on-demand) delivery. The system supplies {{a high concentration of}} oxygen and is used with a nasal cannula to deliver the oxygen to the patient.|$|R
40|$|An <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator</b> {{is needed}} to provide enriched oxygen in support of medical {{contingency}} operations for future exploration human spaceflight programs. It would provide continuous oxygen to an ill or injured crew member in a closed cabin environment. Oxygen concentration technology is being pursued to concentrate oxygen {{from the ambient environment}} so oxygen as a consumable resource can be reduced. Because oxygen is a critical resource in manned spaceflight, using an <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator</b> to pull <b>oxygen</b> out of the ambient environment instead of using compressed oxygen can provide better optimization of resources. The overall goal of this project is to develop an <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator</b> module that minimizes the hardware mass, volume, and power footprint while still performing at the required clinical capabilities. Should a medical event occur that requires patient oxygenation, the release of 100 percent oxygen into a small closed cabin environment can rapidly raise oxygen levels to the vehicles fire limit. The use of an <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator</b> to enrich <b>oxygen</b> from the ambient air and concentrate it {{to the point where it}} can be used for medical purposes means no oxygen is needed from the ultra-high purity (99. 5 +% O 2) oxygen reserve tanks. By not adding oxygen from compressed tanks to the cabin environment, oxygen levels can be kept below the vehicle fire limit thereby extending the duration of care provided to an oxygenated patient without environmental control system intervention to keep the cabin oxygen levels below the fire limits. The <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrator</b> will be a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearable device. A demonstration unit for the International Space Station (ISS) is planned to verify the technology and provide oxygen capability. For the ISS, the demonstration unit should not exceed 10 kg (approximately 22 lb), which is the soft stowage mass limit for launch on resupply vehicles for the ISS. The unit's size should allow for transport within the spacecraft to an ill crewmember. The user interface needs to be designed for ease of use by the local care provider and with consideration to the limited amount of training available to the astronaut corps for medical equipment and procedures...|$|R
