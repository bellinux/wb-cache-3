40|$|By {{using the}} <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>method</b> within the {{frequency}} range 10 to 10 ⁶ Hz at the temperature 492. 1 K and pressure 11. 31 MPa at {{the output of}} the single-screw extruder, the dielectric properties of the composite melt – linear low-density polyethylene + 20 wt. % of graphite + 10 wt. % of carbon black – have been investigated. It has been shown that in the whole frequency range, near-electrode processes significantly effect on charge transfer. For the frequencies less than 100 Hz, in the near-electrode area the conductance is provided with hopping movement of electrons. For the frequencies over 100 Hz, charge transfer occurs through the ion movement. It has been shown that the transfer of ions in the near-electrode area can be described using the relaxation process that, unlike the vast majority of processes described in the publications, meets the wellknown relations only in terms of the complex conductivity. It has been shown that, in the terms of the complex conductivity, this relaxation process can be approximated with Debye equation, as well as it has been estimated the relaxation time (8. 5 ms) for this process. According to the parameters included in the Debye equation, it has been estimated the thickness of the near-electrode area (17 μm) and shown that it practically coincides with the sizes of graphite particles...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} a straightforward method of separately characterizing up- and down-conversion in microwave mixers using a sampling <b>oscilloscope.</b> The <b>method</b> mismatch-corrects the results, determines both magnitude and phase, {{and uses a}} novel time-base correction scheme to improve {{the accuracy of the}} measurements. We estimate our measurement accuracy to be on the order of a tenth of a decibel in magnitude and a few degrees in phase. We use the method to characterize the magnitude and phase reciprocity of a microwave mixer. Index Terms—Down-conversion, frequency translation, jitter correction, magnitude measurement, mismatch correction, mixer measurement, mixer reciprocity, oscilloscope, phase measure-ment, time-base correction, up-conversion.

40|$|Future {{high-speed}} optical communications networks {{operating at}} data rates {{in excess of}} 100 Gbit/s per channel will require a sensitive and ultrafast technique for precise optical signal monitoring. 1 The standard way of characterising high-speed optical signals to use a fast photodetector {{in conjunction with a}} high-speed <b>oscilloscope.</b> However, this <b>method</b> is limited to a maximum data rate of approximately 40 Gbit/s. An alternative is to employ all-optical sampling techniques based on ultrafast optical nonlinearities present in optical fibres, optical crystals and semiconductors. One such nonlinearity is the optical-to-electrical process of Two-Photon Absorption (TPA) in a semiconductor. This paper presents an optical sampling technique based on TPA in a specially designed semiconductor microcavity. By incorporating the microcavity design, we are able to enhance the TPA efficiency to a level {{that can be used for}} high-speed optical sampling...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityThe work is divisible into three interconnected areas, {{the first of which}} is concerned with the empirical modelling of the rubber internal mixing process. Here, the mixing machine variables were changed in a statistical experimental design, and several resulting dispersion dependent material responses monitored. The values of these were next combined into a composite function which related to the goodness of mixing. A response equation in terms of this function and the process variables was obtained by regression analysis. Other response equations derived were for relating mixing time and dumped stock temperature to the input variables. These graduating functions were tested for adequacy of fit; graphical representations of the predictions of the models are shown in the form of contour graphs and isometric projections (both hard copy and colour graphics). These show visual evidence of the influence of each machine variable (and interaction) on the mixing process as a whole. Also by these means, it was possible to establish optimum conditions of mixing. Next nominally identical carbon blacks from different manufacturing locations were mixed into rubber at defined processing conditions. From tests on these mixes the blacks were noted to have different dispersibilities. This was possibly attributable to the varying fines fractions and moisture contents in the test carbon blacks. To check this hypothesis, these factors were varied systematically in two common black types. The compounds resulting from mixing these experimental blacks were subjected {{to a wide range of}} tests to establish whether fines or moisture significantly affected dispersibility of blacks in rubbers. Ouring the preceding work, and also in the course of a critical review included here, it became evident that the commonly used methods for establishing dispersion (and thus mixing efficiency) were lacking, from several points of view. Therefore lastly a technique based on the analysis of an image of a cut rubber surface viewed by dark field reflected light microscopy was developed. Specimen preparation is simple and analysis is accomplished using a standard television system and <b>oscilloscope.</b> This <b>method</b> yields results which discriminate between all levels of black dispersion and also correlate admirably with a variety of processing, mechanical and microscopical properties. In the final stages of the work the capabilities of the method were expanded (in cooperation with Dunlop Ltd, Technology Division) by interfacing a computer and peripherals with the original equipment; such that data acquisition, manipulation and parameter output was made easier, faster and thus more effective than in the initial concept...|$|R
