After the September 11 attacks, the Secretary of Defense had directed the Marine Corps and Brown's predecessor to work closer together in the Global War on Terror. This culminated in the creation of MCSOCOM Detachment One on June 19, 2003, shortly before Brown took command of USSOCOM.

2500|$|In May 2004, Hersh {{published}} {{a series of}} articles which described the treatment of detainees by US military police at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad, Iraq.

In subsequent articles, Hersh wrote that the abuses were part of a secret interrogation program, known as [...] "Copper Green". According to Hersh's sources, the program was expanded to Iraq with the direct approval <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> Secretary <b>Donald</b> Rumsfeld, both in an attempt to deal with the growing insurgency there and as part of [...] "Rumsfeld's long-standing desire to wrest control of America's clandestine and paramilitary operations from the C.I.A."

25|$|As USSTRATCOM neared its tenth anniversary, Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Donald</b> Rumsfeld revived an {{idea that}} had been {{considered}} several times before, a merger of U.S. Space Command and USSTRATCOM. America's military had begun operating in space in the late 1950s, {{with many of the}} early systems developed to meet SAC's needs for surveillance, warning, meteorology, and communications. By September 1985, space activities had grown {{to the point that the}} Pentagon created a new unified command, USSPACECOM, to oversee them. Space systems gave the coalition in Operation Desert Storm a decisive edge, while later operations in the Balkans, Southwest Asia, Afghanistan and Iraq relied heavily on space-based command and control, communications, surveillance and intelligence, navigation, and weather systems. Secretary Rumsfeld's initiative to merge the two commands led to the creation of the current USSTRATCOM in 2002.|$|E

A week after the attacks, Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Donald</b> Rumsfeld announced the call up of over more than 5,000 members of the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve to support the nation's increased security requirements.
