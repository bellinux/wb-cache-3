25|$|We {{are entirely}} in accord in admitting the {{existence}} of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced <b>of</b> <b>mine.</b> <b>Who</b> so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, my faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.|$|E
500|$|Petrucci {{has called}} Portnoy's {{departure}} {{one of the}} hardest things Dream Theater have had to face, and speaking of when he first heard the news, Jordan Rudess recounted, [...] "You know, just to give you an idea of how deep this was to lose him, how difficult it was... after we got off the phone with him... I literally sat on the steps of my studio and cried. This is a guy who's a friend <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>who</b> we all love and admire. We didn't want to see it come crashing down." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinsky {{stated that}} he felt [...] "really inept" [...] when {{recording}} his dialogue. He said: [...] "Amongst my friends I'm funny. In that context of Dan Castellaneta... I {{would say it was}} like a disaster movie, and I was that character played by Susan Hayward." [...] The poem Pinsky reads in the episode was picked by the Simpsons writing staff, [...] "The poem has two jokes in it," [...] Pinsky said, [...] "and when I say jokes I don't mean witty remarks. It's more like an optician, the pope and a zebra go into the bar and then there's a punch line at the end." [...] He stated that the poem was [...] "an elegy for a friend <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> liked jokes". He added that his appearance on the show gave him [...] "a lot more prestige" [...] when visiting high schools and colleges. The episode also features Karl Wiedergott as the professor at the Springfield University.|$|E

500|$|... "Thank you, mister President-elect, for {{inviting}} me to your inauguration gala. I {{would like to take}} a moment from this very public ceremony to speak of something very personal. It concerns a dear friend <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, she {{commented on}} the denial of crimes in Prijedor: [...] "Current Serb {{authorities}} in Prijedor are constantly trying to erase the part of history between 1992 and 1995 and ensure that it isn't written about or spoken about. That hurts us the most. That part of history belongs to us, the citizens of Prijedor, and we can never forget nor are we allowed to because of the civilians who were killed here." [...] She said that she carries [...] "emotions, emotions and sadness for all those friends <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> are no longer here and were killed just because they had different names. It is incomprehensible that in Prijedor, the town where we lived together, {{that that kind of}} crime could occur." ...|$|E
2500|$|The single, {{along with}} its parent album, was put on hold when Adam Ant (who {{has a history of}} bipolar {{disorder}} and was widely suspected around this time to have been undergoing a manic episode) was once again sectioned on 18 May 2010 and it remained to be seen if a medicated and stabilised Adam would wish to continue this project or not. However, interviewed by The Sun on 31 December 2010 Adam Ant – by his own admission once more unmedicated and now including Baillie on backing vocals in his live band – confirmed the song as still on the album. [...] "Georgina is a friend <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> has really been through it. Her grandad still won't speak to her because he is so hurt." ...|$|E

50|$|I think it's a total {{nightmare}} and disaster, and I'm {{ashamed that}} I went against my own instincts in supporting it. It's something I'll never do again. Never. I got convinced {{by a friend}} <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who's</b> smarter than I am, and I shouldn't have done that. No. I want things to work out, but I'm enraged by it, actually.|$|R
50|$|Henri Fayol (Istanbul, 29 July 1841 - Paris, 19 November 1925) was a French mining engineer, mining executive, {{author and}} {{director}} <b>of</b> <b>mines</b> <b>who</b> developed {{general theory of}} business administration that is often called Fayolism. He and his colleagues developed this theory independently of scientific management but roughly contemporaneously. Like his contemporary, Frederick Winslow Taylor, he is widely acknowledged as a founder of modern management methods.|$|R
2500|$|Cornell {{said that}} [...] "Hands All Over" [...] {{is about how}} humans defile the environment, and that [...] "Full on Kevin's Mom" [...] is about [...] "a friend <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> slept with another friend of mine's mom. The guy who did it said to us, 'Yeah, full on Kevin's mom'." [...] The lyrics of [...] "I Awake" [...] were {{originally}} part of a note written by Yamamoto's then girlfriend Kate McDonald. In the late 1990s, an urban legend circulated on internet message boards which stated that Yamamoto, after writing the music, wrote some lyrics {{on the back side}} of McDonald's note. When Yamamoto gave the paper containing these lyrics to Cornell, Cornell looked at {{the wrong side of the}} sheet and believed McDonald's note was the lyrics to Yamamoto's song. There was less material on the album intended as humorous compared with Ultramega OK. However, the song [...] "Big Dumb Sex" [...] was written as a parody of glam metal bands, who often metaphorically addressed sexual intercourse in their lyrics. The song, with its many uses of [...] "fuck", was the reason the album gained a Parental Advisory sticker upon release.|$|E
