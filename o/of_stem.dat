B.auripes bears a superficial resemblance in coloration to the Costa Rican species B.lychnipes, known only from a limited area in the northern Cordillera de Talamanca. The latter species may be distinguished {{by the lack of}} reticulations on the upper half of the stem, a brown or salmon-pink staining reaction on the stem in response to handling, and microscopically by a conspicuously sterile margin and prominent pseudocystidia. Retiboletus retipes is set apart from B.auripes by a darker cap, tubes that lack an olive tinge, and a stem that has more prominent reticulation extending down to the base. In contrast to B.auripes, B.impolitus has a floccose (wooly) or tomentose cap surface, and lacks an olive tinge on the tubes.|$|E
5|$|Mature {{specimens}} of Battarrea phalloides roughly resemble the typical agaric mushroom stature <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> and cap. However, {{rather than a}} cap with gills, this species has a spore sac atop the stem. When young, the fruit body is roughly spherical and completely encased in an outer wall (exoperidium) that later splits in a circumscissile fashion (along a circular or equatorial line), the lower wall forming a volva and the upper part forming scales that cover the inner wall. The upper part rolls upward and backward and eventually falls away in one piece, exposing a spore sac lined with a narrow ring of capillitium and spores. The spores are sticky. As these are carried away by the wind, the drying action of the latter cause {{the edges of the}} peridium to shrivel and roll up more, exposing more spores. This is continued until the upper half of the peridium has shriveled and blown away and there remains only a few spores, which may be washed away by rain.|$|E

5|$|The KIT gene encodes {{a protein}} called steel factor receptor, which is {{critical}} to the differentiation <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> cells into blood cells, sperm cells, and pigment cells. A process called alternative splicing, which uses the information encoded in the KIT gene to make slightly different proteins (isoforms) for use in different circumstances, may impact whether a mutation on KIT affects blood cells, sperm cells, or pigment cells. Steel factor receptor interacts chemically with steel factor or stem cell factor to relay chemical messages. These messages are used during embryonic development to signal the migration of early melanocytes (pigment cells) from the neural crest tissue to their eventual destinations in the dermal layer. The neural crest is a transient tissue in the embryo that lies along the dorsal line. Melanocytes migrate along the dorsal line to a number of specific sites: near the eye, near the ear, and the top of the head; six sites along each side of the body, and a few along the tail. At these sites, the cells undergo a few rounds of replication and differentiation, and then migrate down and around the body from the dorsal aspect towards the ventral aspect and the limb buds.|$|E

The evaluation methods <b>of</b> <b>stemming</b> errors are usually depicted in a quantitative analysis [2]. The application <b>of</b> <b>stemming</b> algorithms to a previously chosen word leads to the isolation <b>of</b> its <b>stem.</b> The stem is considered a concise representation of a word and should be seen as its smallest and unambiguous root [1]. It should also be sufficiently broad in order to capture its meaning as well as its multiple variations [3]. A basic example could be represented by the words biology, biologist and biological, all of which can be represented by the correspondent stem biolog. The results of algorithm applications may be classified as understemming and overstemming. The first group corresponds to the prediction <b>of</b> a larger <b>stem</b> as the correct one.

The mathematical model, describing regularities of bark formation at various relative heights <b>of</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> the Siberian larch trees with various diameters is constructed. This mathematical model is the basis for the auxiliary table containing data characterizing a bark share in diameter <b>of</b> a <b>stem</b> with bark.
