40|$|Ovine {{ricotta cheese}} is a {{traditional}} Sicilian dairy product characterised by high humidity and a short shelf life (2 - 4 days when refrigerated). The increasing demand for fresh food has prompted manufacturers to develop special packaging techniques, such as modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), that can extend the shelf life and maintain the <b>organoleptic</b> <b>characteristics</b> of ovine ricotta cheese. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the shelf life of fresh MAP-packed ovine ricotta cheese by monitoring the microbiological, chemical, physical and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the product. Samples of a single batch were packed in MAP or vacuum packed and stored at 4 °C for 24 and 7 days, respectively. Water activity, pH, physicochemical parameters and microbiological characteristics were examined.

The vacuum-packed ricotta cheese, however, showed a progressive deterioration in <b>organoleptic</b> <b>characteristics</b> from day 5 onward and therefore had a shorter shelf life. In conclusion, the ability of MAP to extend the shelf life of a traditional regional product (such as fresh ovine ricotta cheese) guarantees consumers a quality product and provides opportunities for manufacturers to expand their markets beyond national boundaries...|$|R
