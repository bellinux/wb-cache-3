5|$|King's Highway55, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway55 and historically as the Niagara Stone Road and Black Swamp Road, was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario, which connected the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) with Niagara-on-the-Lake, following Niagara Stone Road. The route divided a swath of wineries {{at the foot of the}} Niagara Escarpment, passing at an <b>oblique</b> <b>angle</b> to the concession road grid.|$|E
5|$|When a {{wave train}} strikes a wall at an <b>oblique</b> <b>angle,</b> the {{reflected}} wave train departs at the supplementary angle causing a cross-hatched wave interference pattern {{known as the}} clapotis gaufré ("waffled clapotis"). In this situation, the individual crests formed {{at the intersection of}} the incident and reflected wave train crests move parallel to the structure. This wave motion, when combined with the resultant vortices, can erode material from the seabed and transport it along the wall, undermining the structure until it fails.|$|E
5|$|A {{prevalent}} {{tradition in}} Florence was the small altarpiece of the Virgin and Child. Many {{of these were}} created in tempera or glazed terracotta by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific della Robbia family. Leonardo's early Madonnas such as The Madonna with a carnation and the Benois Madonna followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, {{particularly in the case}} of the Benois Madonna in which the Virgin is set at an <b>oblique</b> <b>angle</b> to the picture space with the Christ Child at the opposite angle. This compositional theme was to emerge in Leonardo's later paintings such as The Virgin and Child with St. Anne.|$|E

5|$|MD 704 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Eastern Avenue near the eastern {{corner of the}} District of Columbia. The highway continues south as 63rd Street, which heads south toward Southern Avenue and East Capitol Street. MD 704 heads northeast as a six-lane divided highway through the city of Seat Pleasant, where the highway intersects Addison Road at staggered intersections. Addison Road leads to St. Matthew's Church, which {{is also known as}} the Addison Chapel. After leaving the city, the state highway crosses Cabin Branch and intersects Sheriff Road at an <b>oblique</b> <b>angle.</b> MD 704 passes through Landover, where the highway traverses Cattail Branch and meets MD 202 (Landover Road) at a full cloverleaf interchange. The highway continues through the city of Glenarden, where the highway intersects Ardwick Ardmore Road and crosses over Interstate 95 and I-495 (Capital Beltway) without access. MD 704 drops to four lanes again between Ardwick Ardmore Road and the five-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange at US 50 (John Hanson Highway), which is also unsigned I-595. The interchange includes a direct ramp to northbound I-95 and I-495 toward Baltimore; the ramp to westbound US 50 is used to access southbound I-95 and I-495 toward Richmond. MD 704 continues northeast as a six-lane highway across Bald Hill Branch and veers east before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 450 (Annapolis Road) in Lanham.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} soon devolved into man-on-man combat; Seydlitz himself fought like a trooper, {{receiving a}} severe wound. He ordered his last 18 squadrons, still {{waiting at the}} Janus, into the fray. The second charge struck the French cavalry at an <b>oblique</b> <b>angle.</b> The mêlée drifted rapidly southward, past the Allied infantry. Part of the Allied reserve, which had become entangled between the main columns, was extricating itself by degrees and endeavoring {{to catch up with}} the rest of the reserve column away to the right, but the sweep of horses and Allied infantry pulled them into the fighting. The Allied reserve artillery proved useless; caught in the middle of the infantry columns, it could not deploy to support any of the endangered Allied troops. The Prussian infantry on the Shartau hill waited in echelon from the left. Those Allied units who escaped the artillery and the horsemen ran headlong into a hail of musket fire from Prince Henry's infantry. Attempted French counterattacks dissolved into confusion. Most of the Allied cavalry units in front were smashed by the initial charge and many of them trampled over their own men trying to flee. The field was littered with riderless horses and horseless men, wounded, dying and dead. This part of the action took about 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|By {{lining the}} light {{receiving}} {{surface of the}} cell with nano-sized metallic studs, {{the efficiency of the}} cell can be substantially increased, as the light reflects off these studs at an <b>oblique</b> <b>angle</b> to the cell, increasing the length of the path the light takes through the cell, thereby increasing the number of photons absorbed by the cell, and so also the amount of current generated.|$|E

His broad smile, encasing a row of gleaming teeth, seems more a snarl or leer. This is Mickey as Mr. Hyde, his hidden other self now disturbingly revealed.|$|E
25|$|Placing {{the flash}} {{away from the}} camera's optical axis ensures that {{the light from the}} flash hits the eye at an <b>oblique</b> <b>angle.</b> The light enters the eye in a {{direction}} away from the optical axis of the camera and is refocused by the eye lens back along the same axis. Because of this the retina will not be visible to the camera and the eyes will appear natural.|$|E
25|$|In its closed position, a {{swing bridge}} {{carrying}} a road or railway over a river or canal, for example, allows traffic to cross. When a water vessel needs {{to pass the}} bridge, road traffic is stopped (usually by traffic signals and barriers), and then motors rotate the bridge horizontally about its pivot point. The typical swing bridge will rotate approximately 90 degrees, or one-quarter turn; however, a bridge which intersects the navigation channel at an <b>oblique</b> <b>angle</b> may be built to rotate only 45 degrees, or one-eighth turn, in order to clear the channel.|$|E

25|$|The first {{bridge on}} the site was built in 1853 for the {{original}} Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company line to Sandridge from Flinders Street to Port Melbourne at Hobsons Bay on Port Phillip, the first passenger railway line in Australia. In 1857 the St Kilda railway line had opened parallel to part of the line to Sandridge, and the original bridge was replaced in 1858 by a timber trestle bridge carrying two lines of rail traffic, with the tight curve of the original railway removed by rebuilding the bridge on a more <b>oblique</b> <b>angle</b> as seen today.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis for}} {{division}} into zones was the two distinct paths of the heavenly bodies: {{that of the}} stars {{and that of the}} sun and moon. Astronomers know today that the Earth revolving around the sun is tilted on its axis, bringing each hemisphere now closer to the sun, now further away. The Greeks had the opposite model, that the stars and the sun rotated around the earth. The stars moved in fixed circles around the poles. The sun moved at an <b>oblique</b> <b>angle</b> to the circles, which obliquity brought it now to the north, now to the south. The circle of the sun was the ecliptic. It was the center of a band called the zodiac on which various constellations were located.|$|E
25|$|Other {{theories}} {{suggest the}} shape is part tradition and part by-product of its manufacture. Many early hand axes {{appear to be}} made from simple rounded pebbles (from river or beach deposits), {{it is necessary to}} detach a 'starting flake', often much larger {{than the rest of the}} flakes (due to the <b>oblique</b> <b>angle</b> of a rounded pebble requiring greater force to detach it), thus creating an asymmetry. Correcting the asymmetry by removing material from the other faces, encouraged a more pointed (oval) form factor. (Knapping a completely circular hand axe requires considerable correction of the shape.) Studies in the 1990s at Boxgrove, in which a butcher attempted to cut up a carcass with a hand axe, revealed that the hand axe was able to expose bone marrow.|$|E

25|$|Early {{reports of}} torpedo action {{included}} some dud hits, heard as a dull clang. In a few instances, Mark14s would strike a Japanese ship and lodge in its hull without exploding.

The experience of Dan Daspit (in Tinosa) was {{exactly the sort of}} live-fire trial BuOrd had been prevented from doing in peacetime. It was now clear to all at Pearl Harbor the contact pistol was also defective. Ironically, a direct hit on the target at a 90 degree angle, as recommended in training, would usually fail to detonate; the contact pistol functioned reliably only when the torpedo impacted the target at an <b>oblique</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E

Mary is seated on the knee of her mother, St Anne. She leans forward to restrain the Christ Child as he plays roughly with a lamb, the sign of his own impending sacrifice. This painting, which was copied many times, influenced Michelangelo, Raphael, and Andrea del Sarto, and through them Pontormo and Correggio.

500|$|The Mount Cayley {{volcanic}} field {{formed as}} a result of the ongoing subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone along the British Columbia Coast. This is a [...] long fault zone running [...] off the Pacific Northwest from Northern California to southwestern British Columbia. The plates move at a relative rate of over [...] per year at an <b>oblique</b> <b>angle</b> to the subduction zone. Because of the very large fault area, the Cascadia subduction zone can produce large earthquakes of magnitude 7.0or greater. The interface between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates remains locked for periods of roughly 500years. During these periods, stress builds up on the interface between the plates and causes uplift of the North American margin. When the plate finally slips, the 500years of stored energy are released in a massive earthquake.|$|E
500|$|In tetrapods, the pharynx is much shorter, and the {{esophagus}} correspondingly longer, than in fish. In {{the majority of}} vertebrates, {{the esophagus}} is simply a connecting tube, but in some birds, which regurgitate components to feed their young, it is extended towards the lower end to form a crop for storing food before it enters the true stomach. [...] In ruminants, animals with four stomachs, a groove called the sulcus reticuli is often found in the esophagus, allowing milk to drain directly into the hind stomach, the abomasum. In the horse the esophagus is about [...] in length, and carries food to the stomach. A muscular ring, called the cardiac sphincter, connects the stomach to the esophagus. [...] This sphincter is very well developed in horses. [...] This and the <b>oblique</b> <b>angle</b> at which the esophagus connects to the stomach explains why horses cannot vomit.

40|$|Based {{on recent}} studies on local {{deformations}} at coplanar and nonplanar beam-wall joints, the structural behavior of oblique beam-wall joints (joints {{at which the}} beams are at <b>oblique</b> <b>angles</b> to the walls) is analyzed and a joint element developed to model their behavior. Both in-plane and out-of-plane wall deformations at the beam-wall joints are taken into account. For general application to analysis of coupled shear/core walls, the stiffness matrix of oblique coupling beams (beams connected to walls at <b>oblique</b> <b>angles)</b> with local deformations at the joints allowed for, is derived. Using this stiffness matrix, the effective stiffness of coupling beams connected to walls in any direction is evaluated, and its dependence on the angles of connection studied. It is also shown through numerical examples that the coupling effect of oblique coupling beams can be quite substantial and thus, should not be neglected. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
