5|$|As {{viewed by}} the Catholic Church, Baptism {{is the first of}} three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member of the Church. As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account <b>of</b> <b>original</b> <b>sin.</b> If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church does when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E
5|$|Eliot invokes images <b>of</b> <b>original</b> <b>sin</b> and Adam's {{fall when}} talking about the past and points out that such events can be {{forgotten}} but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna to discuss how the past and future are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come at any time and that men should always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|The Augustinian theodicy {{supports}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>original</b> <b>sin.</b> All {{versions of this}} theodicy accept the theological implications of the Genesis creation narrative, including the belief that God created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil {{is believed to be}} a just punishment for the fall of man: when Adam and Eve first disobeyed God and were exiled from the Garden of Eden. The free will of humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for moral evil: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil. The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the will of human beings, maintaining that God is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.|$|E

25|$|In {{historical}} Christian practice, such blowing appears {{most prominently}} in the liturgy, and is connected almost exclusively with baptism and other ceremonies of Christian initiation, achieving its greatest popularity during periods in which such ceremonies were given a prophylactic or exorcistic significance, and were viewed as essential to {{the defeat of the}} devil or to the removal of the taint <b>of</b> <b>original</b> <b>sin.</b>|$|E
25|$|This dogma {{states that}} Mary was {{conceived}} without original sin (de fide).

25|$|New England Unitarians {{evolved from}} the Pilgrim Fathers' Congregational Christianity, which was {{originally}} based on a literal reading of the Bible. Liberalizing Unitarians rejected the Trinitarian belief in the tri-personal godhead: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost/Spirit. Instead, they asserted a unitary notion of God. In addition, they rejected the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>original</b> <b>sin,</b> {{moving away from the}} Calvinism of the Congregationalists.|$|E

25|$|Early Mormon soteriology, {{although}} not following a preexisting tradition, was generally Arminian in tendency. Early Mormonism agreed with Methodists and the Disciples of Christ in rejecting Calvinistic doctrines {{in favor of}} Christian perfection and free will (called free agency).Also, while the Book of Mormon affirmed the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>original</b> <b>sin,</b> it also agrees with other Arminian denominations that children, are incapable of sin and {{in a state of}} grace.|$|E
25|$|Unitarianism is {{also known}} for the {{rejection}} of several other Western Christian doctrines, including the doctrines <b>of</b> <b>original</b> <b>sin,</b> predestination, and the infallibility of the Bible. Unitarians in previous centuries accepted the doctrine of punishment in an eternal hell, but few do today. Mostly excluded, Unitarianism might be considered a part of Protestantism depending on one's stance or viewpoint; perhaps it is more accurate {{to call it a}} part of Nontrinitarianism, or of both.|$|E
25|$|Augustine's {{formulation}} <b>of</b> <b>original</b> <b>sin</b> {{was popular}} among Protestant reformers, such as Martin Luther and John Calvin, and also, within Roman Catholicism, in the Jansenist movement, but this movement was declared heretical by the Roman Catholic Church.
