40|$|In the past, the {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> in the bullet track of gunshot injuries in body regions covered with clothes {{was used to}} differentiate between entrance and exit wounds; as with handguns, a displacement <b>of</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> was considered possible only {{in the direction of}} the shot. In the present study, the transfer <b>of</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> from the entrance and exit regions into the bullet path was systematically investigated with the help of a skin-gelatine composite model. For this purpose, the skin of the bullet entrance and exit region was covered with textile fabric (jeans or jersey material), before conducting four test series of ten test shots each firing a 9 -mm Parabellum full-jacketed projectile from a distance of 2 m. The length of the bullet track was 25 and 8 cm, respectively. Subsequently, the bullet tracks were microscopically investigated in sections for {{the presence}} <b>of</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fibres.</b> In all the investigated bullet tracks, textile fibres both from the entrance and exit regions could be demonstrated.

Cargill Dow Polymers is preparing to launch a new family of polymers on the market known as 'polylactic acid polymers' or PLA for short, which are made from renewable resources such as maize. They have the appearance and texture of natural fibres, and the resilience of synthetics. In the textile industry, they can be used separately, or can be blended with cotton, silk or wool. The main elements in PLA are the sugars from maize, which incidentally is now the major crop of Africa. This may not be a priority in food security strategies, but researchers are keen to identify other sorts of polymers from other plants or root crops with high sugar content such as sorghum, cassava, sugar-cane and even agricultural wastes. These polymers have a much wider use than in textiles alone: in the agrifood business they can be used in canned and packaged foods - soups, flours, pastries and dairy products - and in other areas such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, chemical products (paper, glues, explosives), mining, metallurgy and construction.

40|$|The nature <b>of</b> many <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> is {{hygroscopic}} {{as their}} content of water {{depends on the}} relative humidity (RH) of the ambient air. During absorption heat is generated and during desorption heat is required. Especially in wool the transient sorption heat changes are of a magnitude that garments made of this natural fibre are often attnouted exceptional buffering qualities by people who must frequently shift between places with dry and humid air respectively. For various reasons it has proved difficult to establish the virtually perceived effect of such transient conditions. One reason being that {{less than half of}} the generated heat is expected to affect the body. In a recently published study (1) the present situation was reviewed and the result of experiments with mittens was reported. The authors were fully aware of the difficulties in the use of hands to perceive warmth.

40|$|Approximately, 15 % of {{the total}} textile {{colorant}} production {{is estimated to be}} lost during dyeing and processing <b>of</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fibres.</b> If left untreated, these wastewaters can represent a serious environmental threat. In the present paper a combination of photocatalytic and biological degradation of prepared textile wastewaters (simulation of real textile effluent) is presented. Samples have been monitored through the course of photocatalytic experiments: change in UV-VIS absorbance spectra and complete decolouration were achieved for all three tested dyed wastewaters; however, only partial COD removal was achieved with photocatalytic oxidation (PCOx) and photocatalytic ozonation (PCOz). Toxicity test (Vibrio fischeri) of untreated and pretreated (constructed wetland, CW) samples showed a decrease in toxicity values only for the red-dyed wastewater. Comparison of efficiency of PCOx and PCOz for decolouration and mineralization of three structurally different dyes (anthraquinone and two azo dyes) has been done. CW pretreatment caused faster decolouration and substantial COD removal in PCOx (up to 45 %). Pretreatment also accelerated decolouration during PCOz, but it accelerated COD removal only in the case of red-dyed wastewater due to short irradiation times applied...|$|E
