40|$|For broiler chickens, a major {{mortality}} cause on {{the entire}} exploitation period {{is represented by the}} collibacilar infections, which need a correct and efficient treatment. The mortality in 94 broiler chickens was studied, between three and thirty days of age, from four avian farms from Satu-Mare county, isolating and identifying 32 Escherichia coli strains in pure culture. The testing of sensitivity to antibiotics of the isolated germs was made through the difusimethric method, revealing a decreased efficiency to <b>Oxitetracyclin,</b> Amoxicyllin and Erithromycin, while in the case of Amoxicyllin + Clavulanic acid, Florfenicol and Gentamycin a good sensitivity was observed...|$|E
40|$|Chronic hypertrophic pododermatitis {{cases in}} six horses of {{different}} breeds, aging 14 months to 19 years are described. The lesion begun with a infiltrative {{tissue in the}} frog and sole regions of the hoof, characterized by a fast and disorganized growth, with a papillary aspect, white colored in the roots and dark on the extremity, with a necrotic secretion and an extremely fetid odor. Microscopically, an exuberant epidermic proliferative tissue was observed, intermingled with little connective tissue. The horses {{were divided into two}} treatment groups. In the first group, including three young mares and a foal, showing lesions in only one limb, a surgical resection of the invasive mass was performed, followed by cauterization of the remaining edges and subsequent daily local application of antiseptic substances. In three of these horses, recurrence of the initial lesion occurred, with fast growth of hyperplasic tissue, affecting almost all the frog and half of the sole. Two horses developed contraction deformities of the hoof. In the second group, one male and one female, each with lesions in two limbs, after surgical debridement of the tissue, the animals received daily applications of picric acid 5 %, associated to local use of <b>oxitetracyclin.</b> Although one of these cases required a second surgical intervention for removal of the mass, the horses showed after a period of two to three months total absence of the infiltrative tissue. The use of local picric acid 5 % and <b>oxitetracyclin</b> associated to previous surgical debridement showed to be more efficient than the use of antiseptic substances in the treatment of chronic hypertrophic pododermatitis...|$|E
40|$|Bacteriological {{analysis}} {{were performed on}} 123 lungs in pulmonary cases of adherence in pig carcasses from 59 different farms at an abattoir in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. After classification by the Federal Inspection Service, were collected 49 samples of lungs from carcasses free for comsumption, 45 destined to consumption after heat treatment and 29 from condemned carcasses. Bacteriological examination revealed Pasteurella multocida as the most frequent bacteria isolated (61 samples) followed by Arcanobacterium pyogenes (52 samples), also occurring coinfections with these microorganisms. Capsular type A of P. multocida were prevalent (44 isolates). Other microorganisms also isolated were Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (4 samples), Haemophilus parasuis (2), Streptococcus suis (5), beta haemolytic Streptococcus (4), Nocardia sp (3), Aeromonas sp (1), Staphylococcus sp (1) with negative results on 20 materials. Isolates of P. multocida revealed high susceptibility to antimicrobials on gel diffusion, being only two samples resistant to <b>oxitetracyclin</b> and three intermediary for streptomycin, one resistant and other intermediary to trimetoprim-sulphonamideBacteriological {{analysis were}} performed on 123 lungs in pulmonary cases of adherence in pig carcasses from 59 different farms at an abattoir in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

40|$|Apesar de amplamente empregados em lavouras de tomate para processamento {{industrial}} no Brasil, fungicidas cúpricos e antibióticos registrados para uso agrícola nem sempre resultam em controle eficiente das bacterioses que afetam a cultura. O aparecimento de estirpes resistentes é uma das causas dessa baixa eficiência. Avaliou-se, in vitro, a sensibilidade a cobre, estreptomicina e oxitetraciclina de 389 isolados de Xanthomonas spp. associadas à mancha-bacteriana do tomateiro, sendo 92 de X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria (60 do grupo "A"/raça T 1 e 32 do "C"/raça T 3), 93 de X. vesicatoria (grupo "B"/raça T 2) e 204 de X. gardneri (grupo "D"/raça T 2). Os isolados foram obtidos de plantas doentes em campos comerciais de tomate para processamento industrial nos estados de Goiás, Minas Gerais, Pernambuco e Bahia, nos anos de 1995 a 1998 e em 2000. Alíquotas de 5 ml de suspensões bacterianas foram depositadas em meio Nutriente-Ágar suplementado com sulfato de cobre, nas concentrações de 50 e 200 µg/ml; sulfato de estreptomicina, a 25 e 200 µg/ml e cloridrato de oxitetraciclina, a 25 µg/ml. Nenhum isolado foi resistente a oxitetraciclina, como também nenhum foi resistente ao cobre na concentração de 200 µg/ml do sulfato de cobre. No entanto, houve diferença entre isolados quanto à sensibilidade ao sulfato de cobre na concentração de 50 µg/ml e ao sulfato de estreptomicina nas duas concentrações empregadas. As freqüências de isolados de X. gardneri, X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria (grupos "A" e "C") e X. vesicatoria resistentes à estreptomicina (25 µg/ml do produto usado) foram, respectivamente, 98 %, 38 % e 2 %, ao passo que, ao cobre, foram, respectivamente, 48 %, 4 % e 74 %. Todos os isolados do grupo "C" foram sensíveis à estreptomicina e 97 % sensíveis ao cobre. Copper fungicides and antibiotics {{are frequently}} {{used to control}} bacterial pathogens in processing tomatoes in Brazil. However, failure of control is common and {{can be caused by}} the presence of resistant strains. In vitro tests were carried out to evaluate the sensitivity to copper, streptomycin and <b>oxitetracyclin</b> of 389 xanthomonads strains isolated from tomato plants with bacterial spot symptoms: 92 of X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria (60 strains group A /race T 1 and 32 group C /race T 3), 93 of X. vesicatoria (group B/race T 2) and 204 of X. gardneri (group D/race T 2). The strains were obtained from commercial fields in the states of Goiás, Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, and Bahia from 1995 to 1998 and in 2000. Bacterial suspension aliquots of 5 ml were deposited on Nutrient-Agar medium amended with copper sulfate (at concentrations of 50 and 200 µg/ml), streptomycin sulfate (25 and 200 µg/ml) or <b>oxitetracyclin</b> hydrocloridrate (25 µg/ml). None of the strains was resistant to <b>oxitetracyclin</b> or to copper at 200 µg/ml of copper sulphate. However, strains differed in their sensitivity to 50 µg/ml copper and to streptomycin sulfates (both concentrations used). The frequencies of X. gardneri, X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria (groups "A" and "C") and X. vesicatoria resistant strains to streptomycin (25 µg/ml of streptomycin sulphate) were, respectively, 98 %, 38 % and 2 %, whereas to copper the frequencies were 48 %, 4 % and 74 %, respectively. All strains of group C/race T 3 were sensitive to streptomycin and 97 % sensitive to copper. Ninety eight percent of 'X. gardneri' strains, 38 % of X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria and only 2 % of X. vesicatoria were resistant to streptomycin (25 µg/ml of the product used) whereas the frequencies of copper resistant strains were 48 %, 4 % and 74 %, respectively for the three species of Xanthomonas...|$|E
