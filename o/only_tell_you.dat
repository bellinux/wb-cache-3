5|$|What then is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; I can <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too {{sure that it is}} right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|E
500|$|The refrain {{is based}} on a Gm–E(add2)–B–F/A chord progression. Fraser McAlphine of the BBC wrote that Rihanna feels {{confined}} [...] "in a cell of [...] own creation". She sings without vibrato, a pulsating musical effect used to add expression. One commentator, The New York Times David Brownie, wrote that despite this, her voice subtly shows grief and regret. Eminem then [...] "zap out into a ballady rap": [...] "I can't tell you what it really is/ I can <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what it feels like." [...] The verses follow a Gm–E(add2)B–Fsus/A chord progression. Eminem regrets an end to an abusive, failed relationship, describing mutual violence and expressing both fondness and anger. The two artists' characters are portrayed in a romantic relationship when he responds to Rihanna by concluding the verse: [...] "I laid hands on her. I'll never stoop so low again/ I guess I don't know my own strength." [...] Rihanna sings the chorus again, backed by an electric guitar and a piano.|$|E
