5|$|On the {{official}} SNK Playmore King of Fighters anniversary website, {{an image of}} K' drawn {{in the style of}} the other The King of Fighters XII participants appeared, along with a similar image of Mai Shiranui, leading to speculation that they would appear in the game. UTV Ignition Entertainment's business development director Shane Bettenhausen refused to answer these rumors, but noted fans asked more often about Mai's absence. None of them made it into the game which caused discontent within gamers. In an <b>official</b> <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> by Atlus regarding The King of Fighters XIII, it was stated that K's return was because of popular demand. His return along with his two teammates, Maxima and Kula, as well as Mai, has been met with praise by video game publications.|$|E
25|$|Guitarist Stu G and bassist Jon Thatcher {{formed a}} new band with Jason Ingram as lead singer and Paul Mabury as drummer early in 2009. The band is called 'One Sonic Society', {{and they started}} work on their debut record in June 2009. As a group of four, the band {{released}} two EP's. The first, 'One', was released in June 2010, whilst the second, 'Sonic', was released in October 2010. Following the release of 'Sonic', all references to Jon Thatcher {{were removed from the}} band website and <b>official</b> <b>press</b> <b>releases,</b> and it was confirmed by {{a source close to the}} band that Thatcher was no longer a member and that the band were now officially a three-piece. There have been no official comments on Thatcher's departure from any of the band members, although the split is thought to have been an amicable one. As of March 2011, One Sonic Society have been recording 'Society', the third and final EP in the trilogy. A live album compiling the songs from the EP has also been planned.|$|E
25|$|Unit 2 was {{operating}} {{at the time}} of the earthquake and experienced the same controlled initial shutdown as the other units. As with unit 1, the reactor scrammed following the earthquake. The two diesel generators came online and initially all cooling systems were available. Initially the high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system was primary cooling the core and at 15:00 operators activated the residual heat removal system main pump and the containment vessel spray pump at 15:07 to cool the suppression pool; all these systems failed following both AC power and DC power loss after the tsunami as the diesel generators and other systems failed when the tsunami overran the plant. The reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) system was manually activated by operators at 15:39 following power loss, but by midnight the status of the reactor was unclear; some monitoring equipment was still operating on temporary power. The coolant level was stable and preparations were underway to reduce pressure in the reactor containment vessel should it become necessary, though TEPCO did not state in press releases what these preparations were, and the government had been advised that this might happen. The RCIC was reported by TEPCO to have shut down around 19:00 JST on 12 March, but reported to be operating again as of 09:00 JST 13 March. The pressure reduction of the reactor containment vessel commenced before midnight on 12 March although the IAEA reported that as of 13:15 JST 14 March, that according to information supplied to them, no venting had taken place at the plant. A report in The New York Times suggested that plant officials initially concentrated efforts on a damaged fuel storage pool at Unit 2, diverting attention from problems arising at the other reactors, but that incident was not reported in <b>official</b> <b>press</b> <b>releases.</b> The IAEA reported that on 14 March at 09:30, the RCIC was still operating and that power was being provided by a mobile generator.|$|E

500|$|The {{political}} and cultural impacts {{of the development of}} nuclear weapons were profound and far-reaching. William Laurence of the New York Times, the first to use the phrase [...] "Atomic Age", became the official correspondent for the Manhattan Project in spring 1945. In 1943 and 1944 he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the Office of Censorship to permit writing about the explosive potential of uranium, and government officials felt that he had earned the right to report on the biggest secret of the war. Laurence witnessed both the Trinity test and the bombing of Nagasaki and wrote the <b>official</b> <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> prepared for them. He went on to write a series of articles extolling the virtues of the new weapon. His reporting before and after the bombings helped to spur public awareness of the potential of nuclear technology and motivated its development in the United States and the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|The Daily Mail sent Beach Thomas to France {{as a war}} {{correspondent}} {{during the}} First World War. Many newspapers were keen to support the war effort and {{to take advantage of}} the demand for news from the front. The British military authorities were opposed to the presence of journalists, preferring instead to control the media by issuing <b>official</b> <b>press</b> <b>releases.</b> Lord Kitchener in particular was opposed to their presence, having had bad experiences of journalists during the Boer War. He formed a press bureau headed by , and demanded that all reports be channelled through the bureau for review by censors; the resulting output was bland and impersonal. The newspapers countered with subterfuge. Beach Thomas was one of several journalists who managed to reach the front lines in Belgium. He was discovered there and imprisoned for some time by the British Army. He described the episode as [...] "the longest walking tour of my life, and the queerest." [...] Even these early unapproved reports, which consisted mostly of human interest stories because there was little opportunity for contact with the British Expeditionary Force, were censored at home owing to a paradox that Beach Thomas described: [...] "the censors would not publish any article if it indicated that the writer had seen what he wrote of. He must write what he thought was true, not what he knew to be true." ...|$|E

[...] The team {{correctly}} anticipated that the national media and baseball fans outside of the Southern California media market would simply drop [...] "of Anaheim" [...] and refer to the team as the [...] "Los Angeles Angels".
