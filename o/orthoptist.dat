40|$|Background: Glasses for {{children}} are recommended and prescribed by {{different groups of}} professionals. We set out to compare the prescription practices of ophthalmologists, <b>orthoptists</b> and optometrists/opticians in Switzerland. Methods: Online questionnaire on the prescription and recommendation of glasses in fictitious cases of children of different ages, refractive values and symptoms. The questionnaire was sent out {{to members of the}} Swiss Ophthalmological Society, Swiss Orthoptics and Schweizerischer Berufsverband für Augenoptik und Optometrie. Results: 307 questionnaires were analysed. Optometrists/opticians recommended glasses with a significantly smaller cycloplegic refraction value (p[*]<[*] 0. 005) than did <b>orthoptists</b> and ophthalmologists. In the example of a 14 -year-old asymptomatic child, ophthalmologists recommended glasses at +[*] 2. 64 [Dpt], <b>orthoptists</b> at +[*] 2. 44 [Dpt] and optometrists/opticians at +[*] 1. 32 [Dpt]. Optometrists/opticians tended to recommend slightly higher correction values in glasses than did ophthalmologists and <b>orthoptists.</b> Conclusion: In Switzerland, optometrists/opticians recommend glasses with significantly smaller cycloplegic refraction values than do <b>orthoptists</b> and ophthalmologists, regardless of age or symptoms described in these fictitious cases...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This review {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the tasks performed by <b>orthoptists,</b> the types of patients they manage, their work settings, the professionals they work with, and the professionals they receive referrals from and refer to. Methods: A systematic search of seven databases was conducted to identify all studies regarding the role of <b>orthoptists</b> that were published in English in peer-reviewed journals from January 2003 to January 2013. Reference lists of all included studies, as well as studies regarding ocular conditions which were excluded as they did not specifically report the role of <b>orthoptists,</b> were screened manually to identify additional relevant studies. Key orthoptic organisations (International Orthoptic Association, British 2 ̆ 6 Irish Orthoptic Society, Orthoptics Australia, the Canadian Orthoptic Society, and the American Association of Certified <b>Orthoptists)</b> {{were asked to provide}} any literature relevant to this review. Studies were allocated to the National Health and Medical Research Council hierarchy of evidence. Systematic reviews were appraised using the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine Systematic Review Critical Appraisal Sheet, and level II or III_ 1 studies appraised with the PEDro scale. Data pertaining to the patient’s ocular conditions and co-morbidities, tasks performed, work settings, colleagues/ teams, and referrals were extracted and reported descriptively. Results: No relevant studies were identified; hence this is an empty review. Conclusion: No studies have been published (January 2003 -January 2013) investigating the role of <b>orthoptists.</b> There is, therefore, an urgent need for research into this area to ensure that policy-makers can best utilise <b>orthoptists</b> within their health services and to ensure that the training of <b>orthoptists</b> matches the professional roles in which they are likely to undertake...|$|R

50|$|Orthoptics has a {{long history}} in {{supporting}} ophthalmic care. French ophthalmologist Louis Emile Javal, began using ocular exercises to treat strabismus (wandering eye) and described the practice of orthoptics in his writings in the late 19th century. Mary Maddox pioneered the orthoptic profession and was the first documented <b>orthoptist.</b> She was trained by her father, Ernest E. Maddox, in response to increasing patient demand and time needed to examine and treat patients. Dr Ernest Maddox was a reputed ophthalmologist as well as the inventor of various instruments for investigating binocular vision. Mary Maddox started her own practice in London in the early 1920s and her first hospital clinic opened at the Royal Westminster Hospital in 1928. The first Australian hospital clinic with orthoptists was established at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne in 1931.|$|E

5000|$|A pinhole {{occluder}} is an opaque disk {{with one}} or more small holes through it, used by ophthalmologists, orthoptists and optometrists to test visual acuity. The occluder is a simple way to focus light, as in a pinhole camera, temporarily removing the effects of refractive errors such as myopia. Because light passes only {{through the center of the}} eye's lens, defects in the shape of the lens (errors of refraction) have no effect while the occluder is used. In this way the ophthalmologist, <b>orthoptist</b> or optometrist can estimate the maximum improvement in a patient's vision that can be attained by lenses to correct errors of refraction. [...] This can be used to distinguish visual defects caused by refractive error, which improve when the occluder is used, from other problems, which do not. The pinhole occluder can also be used in testing visual acuity in mydriatic patients. In this case the pinhole occluder compensates for the inability to contract the iris assisting the eye in obtaining a retinal projection similar to that of a non-cycloplegic eye.|$|E
50|$|A vision therapist, usually {{either an}} <b>orthoptist</b> or optometrist, works with {{patients}} that require vision therapy, such as low vision patients. Commonly, vision therapy is performed {{in children who}} develop problems with their vision mostly because they are using their eyes up close. This type of therapy is however generally used in patients who need visual correction but for whom the corrective lenses are not enough to reverse the condition. Visual therapy in children is performed by optometrists who specialize in children eye care. To specialize in vision therapy, doctors must complete extensive post-graduate training beyond their optometric degree, at which time they are eligible to sit for their national boards to become fully certified as specialists in children's vision. A doctor's title after passing the national board in vision therapy is Fellow in the College of Optometrists in Vision Development, or F.C.O.V.D. Optometrists who provide vision therapy but {{who have not yet}} sat for their certification exams are board-eligible Associates in the College of Optometrists in Vision Development.Vision therapists typically rely on prisms, eye patches, filtered lenses, and computerized systems to conduct therapy sessions.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To compare {{clinical}} practice patterns regarding atropine penalization use by UK <b>orthoptists</b> {{to the current}} evidence base and identify any existing barriers against use of AP as first-line treatment. Methods: An online survey was designed to assess current practice patterns of UK <b>orthoptists</b> using atropine penalization. They {{were asked to identify}} issues limiting their use of atropine penalization and give opinions on its effectiveness compared to occlusion. Descriptive statistics and content analysis were applied to the results. Results: Responses were obtained from 151 <b>orthoptists</b> throughout the United Kingdom. The main perceived barriers to use of atropine penalization were inability to prescribe atropine and supply difficulties. However, respondents also did not consider atropine penalization as effective as occlusion in treating amblyopia, contrary to recent research findings. Patient selection criteria and treatment administration largely follows current evidence. More <b>orthoptists</b> use atropine penalization as first-line treatment than previously reported. Conclusions: Practitioners tend to closely follow the current evidence base when using atropine penalization, but reluctance in offering it as first-line treatment or providing a choice for parents between occlusion and atropine still remains. This may result from concerns regarding atropine’s general efficacy, side effects, and risk of reverse amblyopia.
