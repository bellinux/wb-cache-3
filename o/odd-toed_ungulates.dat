5|$|Bats are placental mammals. They were {{formerly}} grouped in the superorder Archonta, {{along with}} the treeshrews (Scandentia), colugos (Dermoptera), and the primates, because of the apparent similarities between Megachiroptera and such mammals. Genetic evidence places bats in the superorder Laurasiatheria, with its sister taxon as Fereuungulata, which includes carnivorans, pangolins, <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates,</b> even-toed ungulates, and cetaceans. One study places Chiroptera as a sister taxon to <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates</b> (Perissodactyla).|$|E
5|$|The horse {{adapted to}} survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, {{surviving}} in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals, especially ruminants, could not. Horses and other equids are <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates</b> of the order Perissodactyla, a group of mammals that was dominant during the Tertiary period. In the past, this order contained 14families, but only three—Equidae (the horse and related species), Tapiridae (the tapir), and Rhinocerotidae (the rhinoceroses)—have survived to the present day.|$|E
5|$|Horses are <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates,</b> {{or members}} of the order Perissodactyla. This order also {{includes}} the extant species of rhinos and tapirs, and many extinct families and species. Members of this order walk on either one toe (like horses) or three toes (like rhinos and tapirs). This {{is in contrast to}} even-toed ungulates, members of the order Artiodactyla, which walk on cloven hooves, or two toes. This order includes many species associated with livestock, such as sheep, goats, pigs, cows and camels, as well as species of giraffes, antelopes and deer.|$|E

50|$|Almogaver is an extinct {{possible}} <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> genus in {{the family}} Phenacodontidae. It was a ground-dwelling herbivore. It is known from the Tremp Basin in Spain, and some authorities consider it synonymous with Phenacodus.|$|R
50|$|Lambdotheriidae is an extinct {{family of}} the Perissodactyla (<b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate)</b> order (that is, {{browsing}} and grazing animals). The family was named by the paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1889. It is often considered {{to be part of}} Brontotheriidae.|$|R
5|$|Equus is a genus {{of mammals}} {{in the family}} Equidae, which {{includes}} horses, asses, and zebras. Within Equidae, Equus is the only recognized extant genus, comprising seven living species. The term equine refers to any member of this genus, including horses. Like Equidae more broadly, Equus has numerous extinct species known only from fossils. The genus most likely originated in North America and spread quickly to the Old World. Equines are <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates</b> with slender legs, long heads, relatively long necks, manes (erect in most subspecies) and long tails. All species are herbivorous, and mostly grazers with simpler digestive systems than ruminants but able to subsist on lower quality vegetation.|$|E

50|$|Chacomylus is an extinct genus of <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> condylarth which {{existed in}} the Nacimiento Formation, United States during the early Paleocene period (Puercan age). It was first named by Thomas E. Williamson and Anne Weil in 2011 and the type species is Chacomylus sladei.|$|R
25|$|Afrotheria {{contains}} {{several groups}} that are only distantly related according to the paleontologists' version: Afroinsectiphilia ("African insectivores"), Tubulidentata (aardvarks, which paleontologists regard as much closer to <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates</b> than to other members of Afrotheria), Macroscelidea (elephant shrews, usually regarded as close to rabbits and rodents). The only members of Afrotheria that paleontologists would regard as closely related are Hyracoidea (hyraxes), Proboscidea (elephants) and Sirenia (manatees, dugongs).|$|E
25|$|Phenacodontidae is {{the most}} recent family in the order Condylarthra {{believed}} to be the ancestral to the <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates.</b> It contains the genera Almogaver, Copecion, Ectocion, Eodesmatodon, Meniscotherium, Ordathspidotherium, Phenacodus and Pleuraspidotherium. The family lived from the Early Paleocene to the Middle Eocene in Europe and were {{about the size of a}} sheep, with tails making slightly less than half of the length of their bodies and unlike their ancestors, good running skills for eluding predators.|$|E
25|$|The horse {{belongs to}} the order Perissodactyla (<b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates),</b> the members of which all share hooved feet and an odd number of toes on each foot, as well as mobile upper lips and a similar tooth structure. This means that horses share a common ancestry with tapirs and rhinoceroses. The perissodactyls arose in the late Paleocene, less than 10 million years after the Cretaceous–Paleogene {{extinction}} event. This group of animals {{appears to have been}} originally specialized for life in tropical forests, but whereas tapirs and, to some extent, rhinoceroses, retained their jungle specializations, modern horses are adapted to life on drier land, in the much harsher climatic conditions of the steppes. Other species of Equus are adapted to a variety of intermediate conditions.|$|E
50|$|Several mammal groups {{traditionally}} {{classified as}} condylarths, long-{{understood to be}} a wastebasket taxon, such as hyopsodontids and phenacodontids, are now understood {{to be part of}} the <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> assemblage. Phenacodontids seem to be stem-perissodactyls, while hyopsodontids are closely related to horses and brontotheres, despite their more primitive overall appearance.|$|R
5000|$|Hyopsodus is a genus of extinct <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> mammal of {{the family}} Hyopsodontidae.

50|$|Mesolambdolophus is an extinct genus {{of small}} <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> {{known from the}} Bridgerian North American Stage (late Early to early Middle Eocene) of Wyoming, United States. It is known only from the holotype MCZ 19585, a nearly {{complete}} mandible which was collected from the Bridger Formation. It was first named by Luke T. Holbrook and Joshua Lapergola in 2011 and the type species is Mesolambdolophus setoni.|$|R
50|$|Schizotheriines make up an extinct clade of {{the family}} Chalicotheriidae, a group of herbivorous, <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> (perissodactyl) mammals. Unlike the gorilla-like {{proportions}} of other chalicotheres, schizotheriines had smaller body proportions, closer to those of Moropus. Analysis of dental microwear implies most Miocene Schizotheriinae fed on leaves, bark, and twigs. Their claws were most likely used in a hook-like manner to pull down branches, suggesting they lived as bipedal browsers. They {{are related to the}} modern horse, rhino, and tapir.|$|R
50|$|Eggysodon is an extinct genus of <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate.</b> It was a small, ground-dwelling browser, and fossils {{have been}} found in Oligocene rocks of Germany. A closely related genus, but with a greater number of incisors and premolars, has been found in Oligocene rocks in Khazakhstan. The genus, Tenisia, was {{described}} in 1915. Eggysodon may have been related to Preaceratherium, and both had tusklike canines and smaller, and fewer, incisors. It is also related to Prohyracodon, and is synonymous with Allacerops.|$|R
2500|$|Chalicotherium (Ancient Greek χαλιξ/khalix, khalik-: pebble/gravel + θηρίον/thērion, {{diminutive}} of θηρ/thēr : beast) is a genus of extinct browsing <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates</b> of {{the order}} Perissodactyla and family Chalicotheriidae, found in Europe, Africa, and Asia during the Late Oligocene to Lower Pliocene, living from 28.4—3.6 million years ago, existing for approximately [...]|$|E
2500|$|A tapir ( [...] , [...] , or [...] ) is a large, herbivorous mammal, {{similar in}} shape to a pig, with a short, prehensile nose trunk. Tapirs inhabit jungle and forest regions of South America, Central America, and Southeastern Asia. The five extant species of tapirs are the Brazilian tapir, the Malayan tapir, the Baird's tapir, the kabomani tapir, and the {{mountain}} tapir. The four species that have been evaluated (the Brazilian, Malayan, Baird's and mountain tapir) are all classified as endangered or vulnerable. Their closest relatives are the other <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates,</b> which include horses, donkeys, zebras and rhinoceroses.|$|E
6000|$|... "The oldest {{representative}} of the horse at present known is the [...] diminutive Eohippus from the Lower Eocene. Several species have [...] been found, all {{about the size of}} a fox.

40|$|The kulan (Equus hemionus kulan) is {{the only}} <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> left in the wild in {{northern}} Eurasia. In the 1930 s, the kulan survived in southern Turkmenistan only. In the 1940 s, kulans were found only in an area named Badkhyz in Turkmenistan. To conserve the last natural population of this subspecies of kulan the Badkhyz Natural Reserve was established in 1941. The historical and contemporary distribution, fluctuation in numbers, conservation and sci research of kulan populations in the Badkhyz Natural reserve are reviewed in this paper...|$|R
50|$|In 1861, Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville (1777-1850) {{classified}} ungulates by {{the structure}} of their feet, differentiating those with an even number of toes from those with an odd number. He moved the horses as solidungulate over to the tapirs and rhinos as multungulate animals and referred {{to all of them}} together as onguligrades à doigts impairs, coming close to the concept of the <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> as a systematic unit. Richard Owen (1804-1892) quoted Blainville in his study on fossil mammals of the Isle of Wight and introduced the name Perissodactyla.|$|R
50|$|Tapirus kabomani (also {{known as}} the little black tapir or kabomani tapir) {{is one of five}} extant species of tapir, large {{browsing}} mammals similar in shape to a pig. It is the smallest tapir species, even smaller than mountain tapir (T. pinchaque), which had been considered the smallest. T. kabomani is found in the Amazon rainforest, where it appears to be sympatric with the South American tapir (T. terrestris). When it was announced in December 2013, T. kabomani was the first <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> discovered in over 100 years.|$|R

50|$|Chalicotheriines make up an extinct {{subfamily}} of {{the family}} Chalicotheriidae, a group of herbivorous, <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> (perissodactyl) mammals. Characteristics of this group included a horse-like long head, very long forelimbs, short hindlimbs, a partial knuckle-walking position and a relatively gorilla-like physique. Members of this subfamily were regarded as possessing {{one of the longest}} forelimbs and shortest hindlimbs in relation to each other out of all extinct animals. Analysis of dental wear implies most chalicotheriines fed on seeds and fruit. Their claws were most likely used in a hook-like manner to pull down branches, suggesting they lived as bipedal browsers. Presence of chalicotheriine fossils is generally regarded as an indicator of treed environments.|$|R
500|$|In 1910, more partial fossils were {{discovered}} in Dera Bugti during an expedition by the British palaeontologist Clive Forster-Cooper. Based on these remains, Foster-Cooper moved A. bugtiense to the new genus Paraceratherium, meaning [...] "near the hornless beast", in reference to Aceratherium. His rationale for this reclassification was the species' distinctly down-turned lower tusks. In 1913, Forster-Cooper named a new genus and species, Thaumastotherium ("wonderful beast") osborni, based on larger fossils from the same excavations, but he renamed the genus Baluchitherium later that year because the former name was preoccupied, as {{it had already been}} used for a hemipteran insect. The fossils of Baluchitherium were so fragmentary that Foster-Cooper was only able to identify {{it as a kind of}} <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate,</b> but he mentioned the possibility of confusion with Paraceratherium. The American palaeontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, after which B. osborni was named, suggested it may have been a titanothere.|$|R
50|$|The horse (Equus ferus caballus) {{is one of}} two extant {{subspecies}} of Equus ferus. It is an <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> mammal {{belonging to}} the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication {{is believed to have been}} widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.|$|R
