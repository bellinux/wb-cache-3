30|$|Standard {{procedures}} {{described in}} Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (Alsina and Blanch 1994) {{were used for}} the species identification. Gram coloration, cell morphology, the oxidase, catalase, indole production, <b>O-F</b> <b>test,</b> motility (mannitol-motility agar, Pronadisa, Madrid, Spain) and susceptibility to the vibriostatic compound O/ 129 (10 and 150  μg/disc) were the first tests employed to identify the organisms belonging to the Vibrio genus. The API 20 NE (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) procedure was modified in order to incorporate a 2.5 % NaCl concentration in all microtubes. An initial bacterial suspension was therefore prepared in 5  mL of a 2.5 % NaCl solution instead of the recommended 0.85 % NaCl medium. Incubation time and temperature were maintained within the limits prescribed (30 °C for 24  h) (Croci et al. 2007). Identification was obtained through the APILAB PLUS software (bioMerieux) and was considered acceptable when giving a probability equal or greater than 80 % (Croci et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|Citrus canker, {{caused by}} the {{bacterium}} Xanthomonas citri (Hasse) occurs in {{large areas of the}} world’s citrus growing countries including Nepal. Though the disease has serious effect in Nepal, this is the first detailed study carried out to isolate the pathogen and confirm it by available biochemical tests and pathogenicity test. Furthermore, the study was intended to find the proper and economical control measure to combat disease in citrus orchards. The causative agent of the disease was isolated from the diseased plants and pure culture was obtained. The isolated pure culture was subjected to Gram staining, catalase test, oxidase test, <b>O-F</b> <b>test,</b> starch hydrolysis, nitrate reduction test, methylred test, Voges-prausker test, indole production test, urease test and carbohydrate utilization test. To re-confirm it, pathogenicity test was conducted on host plant and after the appearance of the typical citrus canker lesion on host, the bacteria was re-isolated, thus proving the Koch’s postulates. Different controlling chemicals, copperoxychloride (2. 5 %), copperoxychloride + kasugamycin (1000 X), bordeaux mixture 1 % and 2 % were sprayed to the plants in citrus orchard at Dhulikhel and the decrease in disease severity after spraying of the chemicals was calculated with reference to the plants that were not sprayed with the chemicals. It was observed that spraying of the chemicals help in decreasing the disease severity. The chemical spray however was not able to eradicate the disease. The study concluded that Xanthomonas citri was the causative agent of the disease citrus canker and copper based chemicals when sprayed very early with the appearance of first symptoms of the disease could eliminate it in citrus fruits to minimum level...|$|E
40|$|Several {{synthetic}} peptide analogues of the amino terminal antigenic determinant (ala-tyr-lysile-ala-asp-ser) of oxidized ferredoxin (<b>O-Fd)</b> were <b>tested</b> {{for their ability}} to inhibit the complement fixation reaction between O-Fd and homologous rabbit antiserum, and to inhibit the migration of spleen cells from guinea-pigs immunized to O-Fd or to a conjugate of the amino terminal heptapeptide (N 7) and bovine serum albumin (N 7 -BSA). The results of the migration inhibition assay suggest that the tetrapeptide and longer peptides of the native sequence were all recognized and stimulated the production of migration inhibition factor. Peptides modified at the aspartic residue were partially active while the serine modified peptide was not. Modification at the amino end of the heptapeptide had no effect on migration inhibition. As specificity controls, it was shown that the N 7 -BSA conjugate inhibited migration in O-Fd immunized animals, while O-Fd inhibited migration in N 7 -BSA immunized animals. The hexa-, hepta-, aspartic-deleted and serine-modified peptides were able to inhibit the complement fixation reaction with O-Fd and specific rabbit antiserum. Inhibition found with the serine-modified peptide and the lack of inhibition with the amino-modified peptide or the di-, tri-, tetra- and pentapeptides indicates the determinant recognized by the rabbit antibodies is either larger or is located nearer the middle of the heptapeptide than the determinant which induced the production of MIF...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the contribution of tests that compose the Im+knent Index {{with regard to their}} ability to predict brain im_oairment. The investigation further examines the ability of various other tests, chosen because of their observed usefulness in detecting brain impairment. Subjects composing ths brain damaged group (n = 298) were found to be impaired on both CT and EEG ezami-nations. The pseudo-neurological control group (n = 193) consisted <b>o-f</b> patients referred,for <b>testing</b> yet all non-neuropsychological tests were normal. Discr 5 nkant analyses were conducted to determine the weightings of each test as well as to determine the overall prediction accuracies of three groupings of tests. These analyses demonstrate that tests, not comprising the Impcirment It&x, are ofpre-dictive value in determining dysfunction: Thursrone Word Fhsncy and a 00 ?ninute delayed recall from the WMS. Overall prediction accuracies of the various test groupings rangedfrom 73. 52 % to 78. 02 %. No statistically significant reduction of accuracy resulted with cross validation. All tests of statistically predictive value and all prediction results with their corresponding discriminant formulas are reported as well as a discussion of the ~pplicetion of thesefir,zlings. In recent years the basic emphasis of neuropsychological testing has tended to shift from the determination of the presence of brain dysfunction toward the description of its consequences (Boll, 1986). While this has, in lxu+t, resulted from the medical profession’s increasing reliance on various scanning tech-niques for diagnosis, it also obtains from the increasing applications of neuro-psychological test data to {{the development and implementation of}} treatmen...|$|R
