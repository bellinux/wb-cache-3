5|$|This event {{creating}} a sustainable and reliable {{relationship with the}} general public is {{a significant part of}} THSRC’s corporate vision and an important foundation of environmental and social sustainability. Therefore, it will continue making efforts to establish a good partnership with the general public {{as well as with the}} stakeholders, customers, employees, suppliers, communities and the government. To create greater value for each of these parties, it will move forward with its philosophy of “Go Extra Mile” to improve their lives through the provision <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly high-speed rail services, which play a central role in connecting the entire western corridor of Taiwan. Since operation in 2007, THSRC has been dedicated to CSR initiatives, emphasizing environmental protection and giving support to all members of the communities served by THSRC. THSRC also published the first CSR Report in 2009, which gave all stakeholders a better understanding of its CSR objectives and activities, and in 2011, we received the 20th Annual Enterprises Environmental Protection Award, sponsored by the Environmental Protection Administration of Taiwan.|$|E

30|$|From {{the above}} consideration, let me assume the following: As the {{activity}} level <b>of</b> an <b>environmentally</b> friendly production process increases, environmental burdens or environmental costs {{made by the}} disposal activity are reduced, since the proportion of unintentionally improper disposal of waste also decreases, possibly due {{to an increase in}} proper information of product contents and so on. It may also be considered that coefficients <b>of</b> an <b>environmentally</b> friendly disposal process decrease as the proportion <b>of</b> an <b>environmentally</b> friendly production process to that <b>of</b> an <b>environmentally</b> unfriendly production process increases, since more proper information on product contents and so on is released and supposed to contribute to improvement <b>of</b> an <b>environmentally</b> friendly disposal process.|$|R

25|$|India's mineral {{resources}} are vast.

India is a net importer of many minerals including coal. India's mining sector decline is because of complex permit, regulatory and administrative procedures, inadequate infrastructure, shortage of capital resources, and slow adoption <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> sustainable technologies.|$|E
