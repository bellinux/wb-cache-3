50|$|<b>Oxamniquine</b> is a semisynthetic tetrahydroquinoline and {{possibly}} acts by DNA binding, resulting in contraction and paralysis of the worms and eventual detachment from terminal venules in the mesentry, and death. Its biochemical mechanisms are hypothesized {{to be related}} to an anticholinergic effect, which increases the parasite’s motility, as well as to synthesis inhibition of nucleic acids. <b>Oxamniquine</b> acts mainly on male worms, but also induces small changes on a small proportion of females. Like praziquantel, it promotes more severe damage of the dorsal tegument than of the ventral surface. The drug causes the male worms to shift from the mesenteric circulation to the liver, where the cellular host response causes its final elimination. The changes caused in the females are reversible and are due primarily to the discontinued male stimulation rather than the direct effect of <b>oxamniquine.</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the therapeutic efficacy of <b>oxamniquine</b> and praziquantel, {{the two most}} clinically important schistosomicide drugs, and to compare the accuracy of faecal examination with the accuracy of oogram in testing for Schistosoma mansoni infection. METHODS: In a triple-masked and randomized controlled trial, 106 patients infected with S. mansoni were randomly allocated {{to one of three}} statistically homogeneous groups. One group was given 60 mg/kg praziquantel per day for three consecutive days, another was given two daily doses of 10 mg/kg <b>oxamniquine,</b> and the placebo group received starch. Faecal examinations (days 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 after treatment) and biopsy of rectal mucosa by quantitative oogram (days 30, 60, 120, and 180) were used for the initial diagnosis and for evaluating the degree of cure. The chi 2 test and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare variables in the three groups. Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) and the log-rank test were used to {{evaluate the}} efficacy of the treatments. FINDINGS: The sensitivity of stool examinations ranged from 88. 9 % to 94. 4 % when patients presented with > 5000 S. mansoni eggs per gram of tissue (oogram); when the number of eggs dropped to < 1000 eggs per gram, sensitivity was reduced (range, 22. 7 - 34. 0 %).

The general increase in immuno-modulation was observed post-treatment with elevated immune reactivity and cytokine production in both treatment groups. Treatment induced significant increases in levels of IL- 4 (p < 0. 05), IL- 5 (p < 0. 0001) and IL- 10 (p < 0. 05) cytokines 6 and 18 weeks after treatment. There {{were no significant differences}} in the increase in IL- 4, IL- 5 and IL- 10 between children treated with praziquantel or <b>oxamniquine.</b> Pre-treatment IFN-gamma and IL- 5 levels were positively correlated with infection (p < 0. 001), while post treatment IL- 4 cytokine levels were negatively correlated with baseline infection status (p < 0. 001). The results suggest that treatment-induced immune responses are similar for both common anti-schistosome drugs praziquantel or <b>oxamniquine</b> having similar and immunizing effect...|$|E
40|$|Available {{evidence}} suggests that the antischistosomal drug <b>oxamniquine</b> is converted to a reactive ester by a schistosome enzyme that is missing in drug-resistant parasites. This study presents data supporting the idea that the active ester is a sulfate and the activating enzyme is a sulfotransferase. Evidence {{comes from the fact that}} the parasite extract loses its activating capability upon dialysis, implying the requirement of some dialyzable cofactor. The addition of the sulfate donor 3 '-phosphoadenosine 5 '-phosphosulfate (PAPS) restored activity of the dialyzate, a strong indication that a sulfotransferase is probably involved. Classical sulfotransferase substrates like beta-estradiol and quercetin competitively inhibited the activation of <b>oxamniquine.</b> Furthermore, these substrates could be sulfonated in vitro using an extract of sensitive (but not resistant) schistosomes. Gel filtration analysis showed that the activating factor eluted in a fraction corresponding to a molecular mass of about 32 kDa, which is the average size of typical sulfotransferase subunits. Ion exchange and affinity chromatography confirmed the sulfotransferase nature of the enzyme. Putative sulfotransferases present in schistosome databases are being examined for their possible role as <b>oxamniquine</b> activators...|$|E
