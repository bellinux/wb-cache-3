40|$|Nonalcoholic {{steatohepatitis}} (NASH) {{is associated}} with caspase activation. However, a role for pro-inflammatory caspases or inflammasomes has not been explored in diet-induced liver injury. Our aims were to examine the role of caspase- 1 in high fat-induced NASH. C 57 BL/ 6 wild-type and caspase 1 -knockout (Casp 1 (-/-)) mice were placed on a 12 -week high fat diet. Wild-type mice <b>on</b> the <b>high</b> fat diet increased hepatic expression of pro-caspase- 1 and IL- 1 β. Both wild-type and Casp 1 (-/-) mice <b>on</b> the <b>high</b> fat diet gained more weight than mice on a control diet. Hepatic steatosis and TG levels were increased in wild-type mice <b>on</b> <b>high</b> fat diet, but were attenuated {{in the absence of}} caspase- 1. Plasma cholesterol and free fatty acids were elevated in wild-type, but not Casp 1 (-/-) mice, <b>on</b> <b>high</b> fat diet. ALT levels were elevated in both wild-type and Casp 1 (-/-) mice <b>on</b> <b>high</b> fat diet compared to control. Hepatic mRNA expression for genes associated with lipogenesis was lower in Casp 1 (-/-) mice <b>on</b> <b>high</b> fat diet compared to wild-type mice <b>on</b> <b>high</b> fat diet, while genes associated with fatty acid oxidation were not affected by diet or genotype. Hepatic Tnfα and Mcp- 1 mRNA expression was increased in wild-type mice <b>on</b> <b>high</b> fat diet, but not in Casp 1 (-/-) mice <b>on</b> <b>high</b> fat diet. αSMA positive cells, Sirius red staining, and Col 1 α 1 mRNA were increased in wild-type mice <b>on</b> <b>high</b> fat diet compared to control. Deficiency of caspase- 1 prevented those increases. In summary, the absence of caspase- 1 ameliorates the injurious effects of high fat diet-induced obesity on the liver. Specifically, mice deficient in caspase- 1 are protected from high fat-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation and early fibrogenesis. These data point to the inflammasome as an important therapeutic target for NASH...|$|R
