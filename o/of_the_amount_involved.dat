40|$|The {{proliferating cell}} nuclear antigen (PCNA), {{also known as}} cyclin and DNA {{polymerase}} delta auxiliary factor, is present in reduced amounts in nongrowing cells and is synthesized at a greater rate in the S phase of growing cells. The recently discovered involvement of PCNA in DNA replication suggested that this pattern of expression functions to regulate DNA synthesis. We have investigated this possibility further by examining the synthesis, stability, and accumulation of PCNA in HeLa cells fractionated by centrifugal elutriation into nearly synchronous populations of cells at various positions in the cell cycle. In these fractionated cells we found {{that there is an}} increase in the rate of PCNA synthesis with a peak in early S phase of the cell cycle, but the magnitude of the increase is only 2 - 3 -fold. This change reflects similar changes in the amount of PCNA mRNA. The fluctuating synthesis of PCNA maintains this protein at a roughly constant proportion of the total cell protein, although the amount doubles/cell in the cell cycle. Consistent with this observation, the stability of PCNA does not differ significantly from that of total cellular protein in synchronized HeLa cells. We also observed that a maximum of one-third of the total PCNA is tightly associated with the nucleus, presumably in replication complexes, at the peak of S phase. We conclude that the cyclic synthesis of PCNA in cycling HeLa cells maintains PCNA in excess <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>involved</b> directly in DNA replication and the amount of the protein neither fluctuates significantly with the cell cycle nor is limiting for DNA synthesis...|$|E

Estimates of MGEN obtained by apportioning a global total of ∼ 35, 000 kt (range 20, 000 − 50, 000 kt) based on a nation’s gross domestic product agree well with independent estimates of MGEN for individual countries. Import estimates MIMP to the countries believed to be <b>the</b> major recipients <b>of</b> e-waste exports from the OECD globally (China, India, and five West African countries) suggests that ∼ 5, 000 kt (3, 600 kt− 7, 300 kt) may have been imported annually to these non-OECD countries alone, which represents ∼ 23 % (17 %− 34 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> e-waste generated domestically within the OECD.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} for constructing flood frequency curves {{before and after}} forest fires in small ungauged basins. It follows the rainfall-based derived distribution approach using Monte Carlo simulation and allowing for uncertainty in some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variables involved. The generalized extreme value distribution for annual maximum rainfall is used, combined with the SCS-CN method for estimating rainfall excess, and the rational method for peak flow estimation. For pre-fire conditions, uncertainty in the spatially-averaged curve number is assumed. For post-fire conditions, measurements of peak flood water level at the basin outlet are exploited, while uncertainty is considered both in these measurements and in the hydraulic roughness. Multi-variate Latin Hypercube sampling for correlated variables is used to assess flood quantiles. The methodology is applied to a small basin in Attica, Greece, which was burnt in 2007.

There {{were no significant differences}} in <b>the</b> rates <b>of</b> success or complication between groups treated with angioplasty only (N= 68) or directional atherectomy (N= 14). The in-hospital event-free success rate was 55 %. The in-hospital complication rates were:Recurrent Ischemia 16 %Ventricular Tachycardia 2 %Myocardial Infarction 14 %Stroke 2 %Bypass Surgery 12 %Death 1 %Repeat Procedure 4 %Composite 34 %ConclusionLAD bifurcation lesion intervention is associated with a high in-hospital complication rate. Since these lesions are not amenable to stent placement or atherectomy with simultaneous protection of both vessels, these cases should be carefully evaluated before intervention, and bypass surgery should be considered as a treatment option...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{comparison}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ecological Footprint and its counterpart (i. e. biocapacity) {{allow for}} a classification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's countries as ecological creditors (Ecological Footprint lower than biocapacity) or debtors (Ecological Footprint higher than biocapacity). This classification is a national scale assessment on an annual time scale that provides a view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ecological assets appropriated by the local population versus the natural ecological endowment of a country. We show that GDP per capita over a certain threshold is related with <b>the</b> worsening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> footprint balance in countries classified as ecological debtors. On the other hand, this correlation is lost when ecological creditor nations are considered. There is evidence that governments and investors from high GDP countries are playing {{a crucial role in}} impacting the environment at the global scale which is significantly affecting <b>the</b> geography <b>of</b> sustainability and preventing equal opportunities for development. In particular, international market dynamics and <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> economic power facilitate <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> biocapacity related to "land grabbing", i. e. large scale acquisition of agricultural land. This transfer mainly occurs from low to high GDP countries, regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual need <b>of</b> foreign biocapacity, as expressed by the national footprint balance. A first estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> biocapacity <b>involved</b> in this phenomenon is provided in this paper in order to better understand its implications on global sustainability and national and international land use policy...|$|R
