5|$|Chakrapani {{decided to}} retain only the {{background}} of Gundamma's family from the original and rewrote the remaining script, taking inspiration from William Shakespeare comedy, The Taming of the Shrew.

Kamalakara Kameswara Rao was chosen to direct the film. Chakrapani named the central character Gundamma in the remake after <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> in the original, {{despite a lack of}} nativity. Nagi Reddy's family members and the employees of the Vijaya Vauhini Studios used to ask him Gundamma Katha Entha varaku vachchindi?

She had to change the costumes and makeup for each of the twelve characters while filming the song. At one point, Chopra fainted on the set and Gowariker wanted to postpone the filming, but she insisted on finishing the scenes.

After spending three days in hospital, she was discharged and immediately resumed filming to avoid delaying her other projects. Filming was completed by the first week of May 2009.|$|E
5|$|Creatively, {{the focus}} of Watchmen is on its structure. Gibbons used a nine-panel grid layout {{throughout}} the series and added recurring symbols such as a blood-stained smiley face. All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory, and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, an in-story pirate comic titled Tales of the Black Freighter, which <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> reads. Structured, at times, as a nonlinear narrative, the story skips through space, time and plot. In the same manner, entire scenes and dialogue have parallels with others through synchronicity, coincidence and repeated imagery.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} nonlinear gameplay, allowing multiple {{different ways}} to achieve objectives.

The game includes a phone {{that could be used to}} manually dial any number, which is needed to contact several non-player characters. The game also features an inventory system requiring the examination and collection of items, which could be used as evidence later in the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate {{back and forth from the}} doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E
