40|$|A Schumpeterian growth {{model is}} {{developed}} to investigate how <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> affects economic growth when <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> also affects {{the direction of}} technical change. In contrast to previous models, production and pollution abatement technologies are embodied in separate intermediate good types. A set of stylized facts related to pollution emission, <b>environmental</b> <b>policy,</b> and pollution abatement expenditures is presented, and it is shown that the developed model is consistent with these stylized facts. It is shown analytically that a tightening of the <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> unambiguously directs research efforts toward pollution abatement technologies and away from production technologies. This directed technical change reduces economic growth and pollution emission growth. Simulation results indicate that even large <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> reforms have small economic growth effects.

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} partial {{equilibrium}} trade model to analyse {{the interaction of}} trade and <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> {{in the context of}} agriculture’s multifunctionality. We formally demonstrate that free trade is suboptimal if no efficient <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> addressing the provision of multifunctional benefits is in place. However, tariff reductions in a large net-importing country reinforce the incentive for that country to introduce <b>environmental</b> <b>policy,</b> though this policy will be strategically distorted to partly substitute for the tariff. Despite its strategic character, this <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> programme will unambiguously enhance global welfare if it is introduced in conjunction with tariff reductions.
