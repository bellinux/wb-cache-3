5|$|Berkelium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbolBk and atomic number 97. It {{is a member}} of the actinide and transuranium element series.

5|$|After the Norman conquest {{the manor}} {{was held by}} the Bishop of Coutances and later reverted to the crown, after which William II gave it to a {{merchant}} from Bristol known as Harding and then to his son Robert Fitzharding who became Lord <b>of</b> <b>Berkeley.</b> The Berkeley family held it for generations until it passed by marriage to the Cokes of Holkham in Norfolk. In the 14th century it belonged to Everard le Frenshe. In 1621 the Bristol Corporation purchased large portions of land in Portishead and revived the Manor Court. The rights of the corporation over the manor was disputed but they held it until 1836 when they sold it for £8,050. The parish of Portishead {{was part of the}} Portbury Hundred.|$|E

As a reward for this support he would later be made Lord <b>of</b> <b>Berkeley.</b> The abbey was a monastery of Augustinian canons. In 1148 the abbey church was dedicated by the bishops of Exeter, Llandaff, and St. Asaph, and during Fitzharding's lifetime the abbey also built the chapter house and gatehouse.|$|E

50|$|The {{philosophy}} of David Hume concerning causality and objectivity is an elaboration of another aspect <b>of</b> <b>Berkeley's</b> philosophy. A.A. Luce, the most eminent <b>Berkeley</b> scholar <b>of</b> the 20th century, constantly stressed the continuity <b>of</b> <b>Berkeley's</b> philosophy. The fact that Berkeley {{returned to his}} major works throughout his life, issuing revised editions with only minor changes, also counts against any theory that attributes to him a significant volte-face.|$|R
5|$|Those {{opposed to}} the new {{government}} began to make plans to free Edward, and Roger Mortimer decided to move Edward to the more secure location <b>of</b> <b>Berkeley</b> Castle in Gloucestershire, where the former King arrived around 5 April 1327. Once at the castle, Edward was kept {{in the custody of}} Mortimer's son-in-law, Thomas Berkeley, and John Maltravers, who were given £5 a day for Edward's maintenance. It is unclear how well cared for Edward was; the records show luxury goods being bought on his behalf, but some chroniclers suggest that he was often mistreated. A poem, the Lament of Edward II, was once thought to have been written by Edward during his imprisonment, although modern scholarship has cast doubt on this.|$|E
5|$|The {{site has}} been {{occupied}} {{since at least}} the 11th century CE. The original building, pre-dating the Norman conquest of England, was a large house, which became the property of the Earl of Chester after the conquest. The house was given to the Segrave family in the 13th century, and was first described as a manor in 1239. A licence for crenellation was granted in 1305, at which point the house is thought to have been re-styled as a castle. Another licence was received in 1354, and the property was again rebuilt. In the 14th century, it came into the possession of Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, who was banished in 1398, after which the castle fell into disrepair. Mowbray's son, John, inherited the building, and it remained in the Mowbray family until 1481, when it passed to William de Berkeley, 1st Marquess <b>of</b> <b>Berkeley.</b> It was rebuilt again circa 1580, this time as a mansion, having lain derelict since Mowbray's banishment. The castle was all but destroyed in 1662, and remained in ruins until 1800, when the remains were used in the construction of a farmhouse on the site.|$|E
5|$|The United States Forest Service made {{it their}} highest {{priority}} {{fire at the}} time because of the threat to local communities and its proximity to Yosemite National Park. Though Giant Sequoia trees, {{some of the biggest}} and oldest living things on Earth, are very fire-tolerant and need fire to reproduce, concerns rose as the fire approached them. Park officials set sprinklers to help protect nearby Sequoia trees, but the sprinklers were later removed and careful low-intensity prescribed burns were used. Parts of the National Forest are used for grazing, and the blaze impacted 6 of 14 grazing allotments located within the fire perimeter where displaced cattle were scattered over a wide area. Smoke from the fire caused unhealthy air conditions in Reno, Nevada, and the Lake Tahoe area {{during the first week of}} the fire, forcing the cancellation of several outdoor events. School children were sent home due to smoky conditions as well. From Yosemite to the San Joaquin Valley, air quality reached unhealthy levels several times according to the National Weather Service. Berkeley Tuolumne Camp, a family camp operated by the city <b>of</b> <b>Berkeley,</b> established in 1922, was burned to the ground. Nearby Camp Tawonga suffered some damage, including the loss of three buildings. Camp Mather, operated by the city of San Francisco, suffered minor damage, as did the San Jose Camp run by the city of San Jose.|$|E
5000|$|After {{emerging}} in the early 1960s, the “inherence account” attracted numerous proponents and became an influential element <b>of</b> contemporary <b>Berkeley</b> scholarship. In his paper “Ideas, minds, and Berkeley” Pappas revealed some discrepancies between fountain-head evidences and Allaire’s approach to a reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>Berkeley’s</b> idealism. Pappas' critical examination of the “inherence account” is greatly appreciated by Berkeley scholars. Pappas’ penetrating remarks compelled Edwin B. Allaire to revise and improve his conception. Even those who share Allaire’s account <b>of</b> <b>Berkeley’s</b> idealism acknowledge Pappas’ article to be “an excellent review and critique of the IA account.” ...|$|R

5|$|The {{property}} {{remained in}} the Mowbray family until the death of Anne de Mowbray, 8th Countess of Norfolk (the child bride of Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York) in 1481. Anne's estate was divided between John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk and William de Berkeley, 1st Marquess <b>of</b> <b>Berkeley,</b> of whom the latter took possession of Caludon Castle. It lay derelict from shortly after Mowbray's banishment until the late 16th century (circa 1580), when it was rebuilt by Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley {{in the style of}} a mansion. A large banqueting hall was added later by Elizabeth (née Stanhope), wife of George Berkeley, 8th Baron Berkeley. The latter kept the house until 1632, when he sold it to Sir Thomas Morgan, 1st Baronet. It passed from Morgan to Sir John Preston through the latter's marriage to Morgan's daughter and co-heir, Jane. The house was badly damaged in 1662 when King Charles II took revenge on Coventry for its heavily parliamentarian sympathies in the English Civil War. Their son, Sir Thomas Preston, inherited the estate, and upon his death in 1709 it passed to his daughter, Anne and her husband, Hugh Clifford, 2nd Baron Clifford of Chudleigh. The Cliffords retained the property, using the ruins of the castle to build a large farmhouse in 1800, until 1815, when the estate was divided up and much of it sold. The estate was then held by various private owners until after the First World War, when the Coventry Corporation purchased much of it and developed the area into suburban housing estates.|$|E
