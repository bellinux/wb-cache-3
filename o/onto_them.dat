5|$|This serpent eagle {{feeds on}} snakes, chameleons, and toads, and hunts these species by {{dropping}} <b>onto</b> <b>them</b> from a perch in the understory. Its excellent eyesight enables it to hunt {{in the dark}} forest. Very {{little is known about}} its breeding habits, though it is suspected to breed from June to December. The Congo serpent eagle is listed as a species of Least Concern due to its large range and population. This species has been kept as a pet.|$|E
5|$|The Australian swellshark is oviparous. Males have larger teeth than females, {{with which}} to bite and hold <b>onto</b> <b>them</b> for copulation. Whether there is a {{specific}} mating season is uncertain, though in terms of sperm production males are capable of breeding year-round. Females have a single functional ovary and two oviducts, ovulating a single egg into each at a time. They can store sperm for at least 15 months. Females produce eggs throughout the year, laying them in pairs approximately once every 20 days from January to June, and once every 30 days {{the rest of the}} year. The second egg in a pair is deposited 1224 hours after the first.|$|E
5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the actors were required {{to sit in the}} car in front of a blue screen; this allowed for the truck's headlights to later be added in with visual effects. The car itself was attached to a separate rig that was built to replicate the impact of the crash. As the scene was shot, the rig flipped the car onto its side. The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the actors were protected by a sheet of Lexan that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window had exploded <b>onto</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

5|$|In December 1872, Colonel George Crook used Apache scouts {{to find a}} cave in Salt River Canyon {{that was}} being used by Guwevkabaya to mount attacks on White settlers. On December 28, {{accompanied}} by 100 Pima scouts, Captain William Brown led 120 of Crook's men to a siege of the cave. 110 Kwevkepaya were trapped in the cave, when Brown ordered the soldiers to fire at {{the roof of the}} cave, causing rock fragments and lead shrapnel to rain down on the Guwevkabaya. Having nowhere else to go, the besieged gathered around the mouth of the cave, where soldiers (accompanied by Crook) pushed boulders <b>onto</b> <b>them</b> from above, killing 76 of the group. The survivors were taken to Camp Grant as prisoners. The Yavapai were so demoralized by this and other actions by Crook that they surrendered at Camp Verde (renamed Fort McDowell), on April 6, 1873. In 1925, a group of Yavapai from the Fort McDowell Reservation, along with a Maricopa County Sheriff, collected the bones from the cave, and interred them at the Fort McDowell cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Players will {{be granted}} {{experience}} points upon each match. After they have collected sufficient experience points, players can level up, by which new armor, skins, weapons, and power-ups would be unlocked for players to use. Both the player character and weapon can be customized extensively by applying new skins and colors <b>onto</b> <b>them.</b> In addition, players can receive hack modules while playing the game, which are special abilities {{that can only}} be used once after they are collected. There are six types of modules. Scout reveals the locations of all enemies to the player for a limited time after respawning, while Vital Signs shows all enemies' health. Retribution allows players to track their last killer by showing their health and location, while Power Seeker guides players to the power weapon pickup in the game. The Resupply Timer, meanwhile, shows the respawn time of the power-up items. Players can also perform taunts in the game's multiplayer.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), {{also called}} the white {{scavenger}} vulture or pharaoh's chicken, is a small Old World vulture and {{the only member of}} the genus Neophron. It is widely distributed; the Egyptian vulture is found from southwestern Europe and northern Africa to India. The contrasting underwing pattern and wedge-shaped tail make it distinctive in flight as it soars in thermals during the warmer parts of the day. Egyptian vultures feed mainly on carrion but are opportunistic and will prey on small mammals, birds, and reptiles. They also feed on the eggs of other birds, breaking larger ones by tossing a large pebble <b>onto</b> <b>them.</b> The use of tools is rare in birds and apart from the use of a pebble as a hammer, Egyptian vultures also use twigs to roll up wool for use in their nest. Egyptian vultures that breed in the temperate regions migrate south in winter while tropical populations are relatively sedentary. Populations of this species have declined in the 20th century and some island populations are endangered by hunting, accidental poisoning, and collision with power lines.|$|E

5|$|The player flies {{around in}} a fighter with a first-person, in-cockpit view with a fully {{customizable}} fixed head-up display (HUD) as the visual interface. The HUD displays video communications and relevant data on the ship's status and performance, weapons, objectives, and targets. It can also warn players from which direction missiles are locking <b>onto</b> <b>them</b> from, thus becoming an aide for launching countermeasures or taking evasive maneuvers. Players have to maneuver into position and shoot through both shields and hull to destroy enemy ships. While hull damage is unrecoverable, shields recharge over time. With the game supporting force feedback technology, joystick players will find their controllers vibrating or putting up resistance when they engage the afterburners or collide with objects. Similarly, certain events, such as engaging afterburners and firing powerful weapons, will shake the screen {{as a form of}} visual feedback.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{movement}} of workers is associated with temperature, and foraging workers leave the nest after sunrise when the nest is warmed in the early morning. Meat ants emerge and start foraging when temperatures are approximately 14°C (57°F), but {{they are capable of}} withstanding extremely hot temperatures, as workers have been seen foraging in 43°C (109°F) heat. Workers may only forage for several minutes when soil temperature is well above their thermal limit at 45.8°C (114°F). At 50°C (122°F) (soil surface temperature), foraging activity is reduced even further. As these ants exhibit high running speeds during hot days, their speed decreases after temperatures of 50°C due to the physiological stress put <b>onto</b> <b>them.</b> Workers can withstand such temperatures by exhibiting opportunistic thermal responses to adjust their behaviour in order to handle high trail temperatures and alter their thermal biology for low temperatures. They will also deliberately expose themselves closely to their thermal maxima.|$|E
5|$|The {{second level}} {{of the game is}} in Beirut, and focuses on the player, along with a group of Navy Seals, rescuing hostages in a 3D {{presentation}} of the city. If the player is successful in rescuing the hostages and recovering all missiles, the remaining forces will rendezvous at a submarine. During the game, the player-character may grapple onto ledges, climb ladders, crawl, and jump in any direction. The player can also push large crates in order to reach higher platforms. Combat is focused on shooting an enemy with a weapon on sight, however the player can crawl at any time {{in order to avoid the}} oncoming bullets of an enemy. The player is also able to neutralise enemies by dropping down <b>onto</b> <b>them</b> whilst dangling from a higher platform. In every level, the game sets a time limit when a bomb is placed on one of the crates containing Stinger missiles.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker. During the match, a chain was hung on a pole above the ring, and once it was {{retrieved}} {{it could be used}} as a legal weapon. After enduring a series of punches from Lesnar, Undertaker attempted to take the chain down, but the lights in the arena went out and he climbed back down to the ring. Taker then executed a piledriver on Lesnar onto the ring steps. Taker put Lesnar in a dragon sleeper. After getting out of the hold, Lesnar executed a F-5 to Taker. Lesnar made an attempt to go for the chain, but Taker performed a chokeslam off the top rope. Following this, The Full Blooded Italians interfered in the match, trying to attack Taker. Taker threw them out of the ring and did a suicide dive <b>onto</b> <b>them</b> after performing a Last Ride on Lesnar. He then retrieved the chain off the pole and wrapped it around it his fist, planning to strike Lesnar with it. Vince McMahon interfered and pushed Taker off the top rope. Lesnar then punched Taker with the chain to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|The first {{clash between}} the two armies {{occurred}} on the same evening of 5 October, when Wang sent several hundred of his cavalry to attack Shan Xionxin's camp on the plain. Li sent forces from the hills to his general's aid, but the battle ended quickly {{with the arrival of}} night. This attack {{was nothing more than a}} diversion, drawing Li's attention to the east while, under cover of night, Wang sent 200 of his cavalry around and behind Li's forces. Concealing themselves in a ravine behind Li's camp, they waited. During the night Wang laid bridges across the canal, and before dawn his army crossed over and deployed in battle formation close to Li Mi's camps. At daybreak, Li Mi's troops were caught entirely by surprise at the sight of the battle-ready enemy advancing <b>onto</b> <b>them.</b> As the camps were unfortified, the rebel troops tried to hastily form a battle line themselves, but they were unable to prevent Wang's forces from entering their encampments. At the same time, Wang signalled his hidden cavalry to attack. Charging down from the north into Li Mi's camp, the 200 horsemen began setting fire to it. At the sight of the camp to their rear going up in flames, Li Mi's army broke and fled. While Li Mi was able to escape with some 10,000 of his men, many of the rest surrendered to Wang. According to one account, Wang's victory was secured by a stratagem: one of his soldiers, who greatly resembled Li Mi, was bound and displayed to the rebel troops at the height of the battle, whereupon the latter collapsed.|$|E

However Howard Williams and Ruth Nugent have suggest that the number of artefact categories that have animals or eyes; from pots to combs, buckets to weaponry was to make artefacts 'see' by impressing and punching circular and lentoid shapes <b>onto</b> <b>them.</b> This symbolism of making the object seems to be more than decoration.|$|E
