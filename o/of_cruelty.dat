40|$|The {{link between}} early animal abuse and later {{violence}} toward humans {{may depend on}} how acts <b>of</b> animal <b>cruelty</b> are experienced by those whose behavior demonstrates this graduation. Unfortunately, the research investigating the social and emotional context for the youthful commission <b>of</b> animal <b>cruelty</b> as it escalates to adult interpersonal violence is relatively nonexistent. Using 112 cases from a larger sample of 261 inmates surveyed at both medium and maximum security prisons in a southern state, the present study {{examined the effects of}} age of onset and frequency <b>of</b> animal <b>cruelty,</b> the covertness <b>of</b> animal <b>cruelty,</b> the commission <b>of</b> animal <b>cruelty</b> within a group or in isolation, and empathy for the abused animals. Inmates who had covered up their childhood and ado-lescent animal cruelty {{were more likely to have}} been convicted of repeated acts of inter-personal violence, demonstrating that the role of empathy and individuals present during acts <b>of</b> animal <b>cruelty</b> were less important than concealing those acts...|$|R

5|$|Cockfighting {{is said to}} be the world's oldest spectator {{sport and}} may have {{originated}} in Persia 6,000 years ago. Two mature males (cocks or roosters) are set to fight each other, and will do so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed. Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour. The sport formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans, and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter. Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds <b>of</b> <b>cruelty</b> to animals.|$|E

60|$|From a tree {{overhanging}} the palisade, Tarzan watched {{all that}} passed within the village. He saw the frenzied women tantalizing the great lion with sticks and stones. The <b>cruelty</b> <b>of</b> the blacks toward a captive always induced in Tarzan {{a feeling of}} angry contempt for the Gomangani. Had he attempted to analyze this feeling he would have found it difficult, for during all his life he had been accustomed to sights <b>of</b> suffering and <b>cruelty.</b> He, himself, was cruel. All the beasts of the jungle were cruel; but the <b>cruelty</b> <b>of</b> the blacks was of a different order. It was the <b>cruelty</b> <b>of</b> wanton torture of the helpless, while the <b>cruelty</b> <b>of</b> Tarzan and the other beasts was the <b>cruelty</b> <b>of</b> necessity or of passion.|$|R
5|$|For many years, Adrian Boult {{had been}} {{a close friend of}} Wilson and his first wife Ann, née Bowles. When, in the late 1920s, Wilson began to mistreat his wife, Boult took her side. She {{divorced}} Wilson on grounds <b>of</b> <b>cruelty</b> in 1931, and married Boult two years later. The enmity provoked in Wilson was to have lasting repercussions. The stigma attached to divorce in Britain in the 1930s affected Wilson's career: he was barred from performing in English cathedrals at the Three Choirs Festival for 25 years until 1957, when he narrated Honegger's King David in Worcester, by which time his singing career had ended.|$|E
5|$|From January to April 2009, the Scottish Government {{conducted}} a trial translocation of Eurasian sparrowhawks from around racing pigeon lofts in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Kilmarnock, Stirling and Dumfries. The trial, which cost £25,000, {{was supported by}} the Scottish Homing Union, representing the country's 3,500 pigeon fanciers. The experiment was originally scheduled for early in 2008 but was postponed because it would have impinged on the birds' breeding season. It was criticised by the government's own ecological adviser, Dr Ian Bainbridge, the government body Scottish Natural Heritage and organisations including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Scottish Society for Prevention <b>of</b> <b>Cruelty</b> to Animals.|$|E

5|$|Harris, then host of Rolf's Cartoon Time, {{approached}} the National Society for the Prevention <b>of</b> <b>Cruelty</b> to Children (NSPCC) and the Tavistock Clinic with his idea {{about making a}} film on child sexual abuse. Both organisations were receptive. Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of Pity, and a NSPCC official suggested that he use child actors in Kids Can Say No! Harris approached director Jessica Skippon, {{with whom he had}} made a film about water safety, and said that he wanted to make Kids Can Say No! to protect children. Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be told about sexual abuse.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{after working}} in Singapore, Tommy and Hal Meadow {{returned}} to the US with what they say were three local brown-ticked cats. These three cats, a pair {{of male and female}} kittens from the same litter and another young female, were the foundation used to establish the Singapura. The breed takes its name from the Malay name for Singapore. In 1981 a breeder visited Singapore and chanced upon a cat fitting the profile of the Singapura (with the exception of the tail) in the local Society for the Prevention <b>of</b> <b>Cruelty</b> to Animals. The cat was imported to the US and adopted into the breeding program.|$|E
5|$|In March 1911, {{the captain}} of Saratoga, Cleveland Downs, faced legal {{difficulties}} regarding the way live turtles were stored aboard while being imported to market. Downs was arrested in New York on charges <b>of</b> <b>cruelty</b> to animals because the turtles had been stored upside down, with flippers lashed to one another; Miller contended that this was standard practice and asked that the charges be dropped. A later Saratoga captain also faced legal troubles, when, in June 1912, Frank L. Miller was arrested by Sheriff Julius Harburger in New York and forced to post a $500 appearance bond in a civil suit involving a former crewman. Miller’s arrest delayed {{the departure of the}} ship by two hours.|$|E
