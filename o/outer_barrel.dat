Auto-focus speed of the lens is moderate; it is not as fast as most ring USM lenses. The front of the lens does not rotate, but does extend when focusing. The lens is designed so that the <b>outer</b> body <b>barrel</b> is longer than the inner lens barrel, when the inner lens barrel is at its longest extension.

50|$|The AE-1 has a Canon FD breech-lock {{lens mount}} and accepts any FD or New FD (FDn) lens. It is not {{compatible}} with Canon's later Canon EF lens mount, though adapters made by independent manufacturers can be found. Original FD lenses, introduced in 1971, did not rotate in the mounting process; instead, a locking ring {{at the base}} was turned to attach the lens. This was often criticized as being slower than the bayonet mounts of competing cameras. The counter argument, though, was that as the lens/body mating surfaces did not rotate, there was no wear that could affect the critical distance from lens to film plane. In 1979, Canon introduced the New FD series of lenses that rotate the whole <b>outer</b> lens <b>barrel</b> to lock. The inner lens barrel remained stationary, and thus the signal levers and pins still did not rotate. During the late 1970s, there were over 50 Canon FD lenses available for purchase.

The concentrations of neuropil within certain regions are important to determine because simply using the proportions of the different postsynaptic elements does not verify the necessary, conclusive evidence. Comparing the concentrations can determine whether or not proportions of different postsynaptic elements contacted a particular axonal pathway.

The results from the proton beam demonstrate that the principle of two-dimensional position sensitivity based on charge sharing works; the signal-to-noise value is 10. 4, the position resolution is 33. 6 um for X-stripixel (35. 2 um for U-stripixel), and the tracking efficiencies in the X- and U-stripixels are, over 98. 9 +/- 0. 2 %.

5000|$|The Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment, (OSSE), by the Naval Research Laboratory {{detected}} {{gamma rays}} entering {{the field of}} view of any of four detector modules, which could be pointed individually, and were effective in the 0.05 to 10 MeV range. Each detector had a central scintillation spectrometer crystal of NaI(Tl) 12 in (303 mm) in diameter, by 4 in (102 mm) thick, optically coupled at the rear to a 3 in (76.2 mm) thick CsI(Na) crystal of similar diameter, viewed by seven photomultiplier tubes, operated as a phoswich: i.e., particle and gamma-ray events from the rear produced slow-rise time (~1 μs) pulses, which could be electronically distinguished from pure NaI events from the front, which produced faster (~0.25 μs) pulses. Thus the CsI backing crystal acted as an active anticoincidence shield, vetoing events from the rear. A further barrel-shaped CsI shield, also in electronic anticoincidence, surrounded the central detector on the sides and provided coarse collimation, rejecting gamma rays and charged particles from the sides or most of the forward field-of-view (FOV). A finder level of angular collimation was provided by a tungsten slat collimator grid within the <b>outer</b> CsI <b>barrel,</b> which collimated the response to a 3.8° x 11.4° FWHM rectangular FOV. A plastic scintillator across the front of each module vetoed charged particles entering from the front. The four detectors were typically operated in pairs of two. During a gamma-ray source observation, one detector would take observations of the source, while the other would slew slightly off source to measure the background levels. The two detectors would routinely switch roles, allowing for more accurate measurements of both the source and background. The instruments could slew with a speed of approximately 2 degrees per second.|$|R
40|$|Background: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) {{is a major}} diarrheal {{pathogen}} {{in developing}} countries, where it accounts for millions of infections {{and hundreds of thousands}} of deaths annually. While vaccine development to prevent diarrheal illness due to ETEC is feasible, extensive effort is needed to identify conserved antigenic targets.

AT proteins are comprised of a highly conserved carboxy terminal <b>outer</b> membrane beta <b>barrel</b> and a surface-exposed amino terminal passenger domain. Recent immunoproteomic studies suggesting that multiple autotransporter passenger domains are recognized during ETEC infection prompted the present studies. Methodology: Available ETEC genomes were examined to identify AT coding sequences present in pathogenic isolates, but not in the commensal E. coli HS strain. Passenger domains of the corresponding autotransporters were cloned and expressed as recombinant antigens, and the immune response to these proteins was then examined using convalescent sera from patients and experimentally infected mice. Principal Findings: Potential AT genes shared by ETEC strains, but absent in the E. coli commensal HS strain were identified.
