25|$|The {{sensitivity}} {{and accuracy of}} an RNA-Seq experiment are dependent {{on the number of}} reads obtained from each sample. A large number of reads are needed to ensure sufficient coverage of the transcriptome, enabling detection of low abundance transcripts. Experimental design is further complicated by sequencing technologies with a limited <b>output</b> <b>range,</b> the variable efficiency of sequence creation, and variable sequence quality. Added to those considerations is that every species has a different number of genes and therefore requires a tailored sequence yield for an effective transcriptome. Early studies determined suitable thresholds empirically, but as the technology matured, suitable coverage is predicted computationally by transcriptome saturation. Somewhat counter-intuitively, {{the most effective way to}} improve detection of differential expression in low expression genes is to add more biological replicates, rather than adding more reads. The current benchmarks recommended by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project are for 70-fold exome coverage for standard RNA-Seq and up to 500-fold exome coverage to detect rare transcripts and isoforms.|$|E

50|$|A good hash {{function}} should map the expected inputs as evenly as possible over its <b>output</b> <b>range.</b> That is, every hash {{value in the}} <b>output</b> <b>range</b> should be generated with roughly the same probability.

If some hash values are more likely to occur than others, a larger fraction of the lookup operations will have to search through a larger set of colliding table entries.|$|E
