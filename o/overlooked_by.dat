5|$|By {{the end of}} the 13th century a large prison {{had been}} built in the castle; this was {{probably}} constructed in the north-west corner of the Lower Court, <b>overlooked</b> <b>by</b> the Prison Tower. The prisoners kept there in the medieval period included local poachers and, in the 15th century, religious dissidents, including Lollard supporters.|$|E

5|$|Crossing {{points in}} the defence network– bridges, tunnels and other weak spots– were called nodes or points of resistance. These were {{fortified}} with removable road blocks, barbed wire entanglements, and land mines. These passive defences were <b>overlooked</b> <b>by</b> trench works, gun and mortar emplacements, and pillboxes. In places entire villages were fortified using barriers of scaffolding, sandbagged positions and loopholes in existing buildings.|$|E

As a high school junior, he was a first team All-state selection, but he was <b>overlooked</b> <b>by</b> most top scouts until after his junior {{year of high school}} due to his height.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Rastrelli's {{original}} {{plans for}} the building were found in Vienna, Austria. This {{made it possible to}} reconstruct the original images on the building. The plan of restoration was carried out in the 1970s, <b>overlooked</b> <b>by</b> the main architect-restorer, V. Korneyeva. Since 1968, the church has been opened as a museum to tourists and visitors. The church is now owned by the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church.|$|E

5|$|St Mawes Castle is {{situated}} on a headland over the Carrock Roads, <b>overlooked</b> <b>by</b> higher {{land to the}} rear. At {{the top of the}} site is the entrance to the castle, the high-level gun batteries and the 16th-century Henrician Castle; the terraced site slopes down to the water, where gun batteries and the 16th-century blockhouse look out across the water.|$|E
5|$|The beaches {{themselves}} were <b>overlooked</b> <b>by</b> pillboxes of various types. These were sometimes placed low {{down to get}} maximum advantage from enfilading fire whereas others were placed high up making them much harder to capture. Searchlights were installed at the coast to illuminate the sea surface and the beaches for artillery fire.|$|E
5|$|The town is <b>overlooked</b> <b>by</b> North Hill, and is {{just outside}} the {{boundaries}} of Exmoor National Park.

60|$|It was {{not long}} before the Coquette reached the channel which forms the {{available}} mouth of the estuary. Here the ship was again brought to the wind, and men were sent upon the yards and all her more lofty spars, in order to <b>overlook,</b> <b>by</b> the dim and deceitful light, as much of the inner water as the eye could reach; while Ludlow, assisted by the master, was engaged in the same employment on the deck. Two or three midshipmen were included, among the common herd, aloft.|$|R

5|$|A large deer park, {{owned by}} the Crown, was {{established}} around the castle to provide hunting grounds. The castle was carefully positioned next to the park, which was <b>overlooked</b> <b>by</b> the motte. A vineyard was also maintained alongside the castle. The old Anglo-Saxon manorial centre {{was moved to the}} site, and as a result the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Berkhamsted also shifted from the area now called Northchurch to the castle; several mills, essential for grinding flour, were present there in 1086.|$|E
5|$|After passing Land's End {{the path}} {{continues}} further south past Pordenack Point and Mill Bay before turning fully eastward at Gwennap Head. Beyond the tiny village of Porthgwarra lies St Levan. The next bay lies below Porthcurno. It is <b>overlooked</b> <b>by</b> the open-air Minack Theatre and {{is where the}} Eastern Cable Company's cable came ashore, the first telegraph link with India. Climbing out of the bay the path passes the precarious Logan Rock.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing through}} Porthleven the path crosses the shingle bank of Loe Bar with the {{freshwater}} Loe Pool behind. At Gunwalloe more cliffs appear, leading to Poldhu Cove <b>overlooked</b> <b>by</b> {{the radio station}} on Poldhu Point, then Porth Mellin on Mullion Cove with Mullion Island offshore. Rounding Predannack Head, Vellan Head, and Rill Head (where the Spanish Armada was first sighted on 29 July 1588), the path leads to Kynance Cove and Lizard Point, the lighthouse {{of which has been}} visible for some distance. Lizard Point is the most southerly point of the British mainland.|$|E
25|$|We {{put into}} this {{translation}} a particular care because Day`at Moussa <b>overlooks</b> <b>by</b> some hundred meters the village {{where we were}} born. However, we cannot help to have some doubt as to the precise location of this Synod. Mart Moura's church, the generally assumed location for that synod celebration, is well known and its patronal saint's day is still celebrated every year with the fervent participation of the faithful from our village Kfarsghab, on September 24. Also, we think that there lies our village of origin, before unknown reasons to the local memory made us go down.|$|R
50|$|The Umauma Falls were {{accessible}} for viewing until relatively recently only by walking upslope {{along the river}} bed. In 1995 {{the founder of the}} World Botanical Gardens, while exploring the Umauma River gulch edge to find a good viewing point, discovered the current overlook, which had been hidden from view by extensive growth of wild guava trees and sugarcane. Soon thereafter, he carved the current <b>overlook</b> <b>by</b> removing the overgrown agricultural berm along the gulch edge and its guava trees, replacing it with a concrete platform, retaining walls, and steel railing, which is its present configuration.|$|R
6000|$|... § 2. Non-observation {{may either}} take place <b>by</b> <b>overlooking</b> instances, or <b>by</b> <b>overlooking</b> {{some of the}} {{circumstances}} of a given instance. If we were to conclude that a fortune-teller was a true prophet, from not adverting to the cases in which his predictions had been falsified by the event, this would be non-observation of instances; but if we overlooked or remained ignorant {{of the fact that}} in cases where the predictions had been fulfilled, he had been in collusion with some one who had given him the information on which they were grounded, this would be non-observation of circumstances.|$|R
5|$|Despite this, the {{defensive}} qualities of Castle Rising {{have since been}} extensively debated. The historian Robert Liddiard argues that the large windows at Castle Rising {{would have been a}} significant weakness, as {{it would have been easy}} to fire arrows through them from the bailey, and George Garnett has questioned the utility of {{the defensive}} arrow slits, which he suggests were not well positioned or designed. The whole site was also <b>overlooked</b> <b>by</b> higher ground, which Liddiard considers would have been a key defensive weakness.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December, the 16th Battalion Devonshire Regiment, 229th Brigade, 74th (Yeomanry) Division recaptured Beit Ur el Foqa. This {{infantry}} {{attack was}} launched {{from the head}} of the Wadi Zeit at 01:00, and by 03:30 the village had been captured, along with 17 prisoners and three machine guns. The position was impossible to hold, as it was <b>overlooked</b> <b>by</b> Ottoman positions on higher ground. Bombing and hand-to-hand fighting continued all morning, and the battalion withdrew, suffering 300 casualties. It has been claimed that on 3 December the Ottoman Army had abandoned their counterattacks and that fighting in the Judean Hills ceased.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} side of the Inner Ward is another barbican, {{enclosing}} the castle garden. This was <b>overlooked</b> <b>by</b> the royal apartments, and changed in style over the years: in the early 14th century there was a lawn, in the late 14th century vines, in the 16th century crab-apple trees and a lawn and in the 17th century formal ornamental flowers. A postern gate originally led down to the river where a small dock was built, allowing key visitors to enter the castle in private and for the fortress to be resupplied by boat, although this gate is now concealed by the later bridges built on the site.|$|E

5|$|Once the Allies had {{combined}} their forces, the Elector and Marsin {{moved their}} 40,000 troops into the entrenched camp between Dillingen and Lauingen {{on the north}} bank of the Danube. The Allied commanders– unwilling to attack such a strong position rendered impregnable by redoubts and inundations– passed round Dillingen to the north through Balmershofen and Armerdingen {{in the direction of}} Donauwörth. If captured, the bridgehead at Donauwörth (<b>overlooked</b> <b>by</b> the Schellenberg) would offer new communications with the friendly states in central Germany by way of Nördlingen and Nuremberg, as well as providing a good crossing-place over the Danube for re-supply when the Allies were south of the river.|$|E
5|$|Queen's Park, {{the oldest}} club in Scottish football, have played at a venue called Hampden Park since October 1873. The first Hampden Park was <b>overlooked</b> <b>by</b> a nearby terrace named after Englishman John Hampden, {{who fought for}} the roundheads in the English Civil War. Queen's Park played at the first Hampden Park for 10 years {{beginning}} with a Scottish Cup tie on 25 October 1873. The ground hosted the first Scottish Cup Final, in 1874, and a Scotland v England match in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Robert died {{fighting}} the Scots {{at the battle}} of Bannockburn and the region around the castle was attacked in 1314 and 1319, causing significant damage to neighbouring Church Brough. Around this time the village of Market Brough was established along the road <b>overlooked</b> <b>by</b> the castle, in an attempt by the Cliffords to maximise the possibilities for profits from trade along the valley. Market Brough acquired a royal charter in 1330 and seems to have rapidly overtaken Church Brough as the main settlement in the area.|$|E
