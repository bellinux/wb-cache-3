40|$|The {{undertaking}} of {{this investigation}} was to question the aesthetic significance of <b>overprint</b> <b>varnish.</b> To do this a statistical investigation was developed to answer the question: 2 ̆ 2 When the protection factor of overprint varnishing is of little or no significance, does overprint varnishing of the finished product add an element of aesthetic quality sufficient to justify the outlay of additional funds? 2 ̆ 2 The philosophy of the investigation revolved around the investigative sample distinguishing the overprint varnishing process as a significant aesthestic enhancement process. To do this a sample of 15 sets of magazine quality reproductions, all printed under the same conditions, were secured from a local magazine printer. One-half of the above samples were coated with <b>overprint</b> <b>varnish.</b> Finally the 15 sets, each containing the same reproduction varnished and unvarnished, were submitted for aesthetic evaluation to an investigative sample of printing experts and a group of randomly selected people 2 ̆ 2 off the street. 2 ̆ 2 The findings {{of this investigation}} using a non-parametric sign test as the evaluation tool, indicate the group of printing experts differentiate the overprint varnished reproductions as significantly discernible. On the other hand the sample group of people 2 ̆ 2 off the street 2 ̆ 2 did not significantly identify a difference between the varnished and non-varnished reproductions. This being the case, the application of <b>overprint</b> <b>varnish</b> for aesthetic purposes is concluded as being quite questionable. To the printer and especially the buyer of printing, such questionable 2 ̆ 7 conclusions should drastically influence his use of <b>overprint</b> <b>varnish...</b>|$|E
5000|$|A rotary {{printing}} press is a printing press {{in which the}} images to be printed are curved around a cylinder. Printing can be done on {{a large number of}} substrates, including paper, cardboard, and plastic. Substrates can be sheet feed or unwound on a continuous roll through the press to be printed and further modified if required (e.g. die cut, <b>overprint</b> <b>varnished,</b> embossed). Printing presses that use continuous rolls are sometimes referred to as [...] "web presses".|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there are}} growing trends in using palm oil as raw {{materials}} in radiation curable resins production. In this study, the acrylated palm oil resins i. e. the EPOLA (epoxidized palm oil acrylate) and the POBUA (palm oil based urethane acrylate) were synthesized using two different systems, i. e. the 25 liter pilot scale reactor synthesis system and the 2 liter (L) laboratory scale reactor synthesis system through chemical processes known as acrylation and isocyanation. In this paper, {{the property of the}} acrylated resins which were produced by these two systems were evaluated and compared between each other. Their properties were characterized using the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer for functional group identification; the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) for molecular weight (Mw) determination, the Brookfield viscometer for viscosity measurements, the acid values (AV) and the oxirane oxygen contents (OOC) analysis. As a result, the production process for both the 2 L and 25 L reactor system were found to be time consuming and the main advantages for the 25 L reactor was its higher productivity as compared with the 2 L reactor system with the same synthesis process parameters i. e. the temperatures and the experimental methods. Besides that, the 25 L reactor synthesis process was found to be safe, easy to control and served unpolluted process to the environments. The final products, the acrylated palm oil resins were formulated into ultraviolet (UV) curable compounds before subjecting them under UV irradiation. As a result, the UV-curable palm oil resins showed potential uses as pressure sensitive adhesives, printing inks including <b>overprint</b> <b>varnishes</b> (OPV) and coatings...|$|R
5000|$|Hired by Tina Brown in 1992, Art Spiegelman {{worked for}} The New Yorker {{for ten years}} but {{resigned}} {{a few months after}} the September 11 terrorist attacks. The cover created by Françoise Mouly and Spiegelman for the September 24, 2001 issue of The New Yorker received wide acclaim and was voted in the top ten of magazine covers of the past 40 years by the American Society of Magazine Editors, which commented: New Yorker Covers Editor Françoise Mouly repositioned Art Spiegelman's silhouettes, inspired by Ad Reinhardt's black-on-black paintings, so that the North Tower's antenna breaks the [...] "W" [...] of the magazine's logo. Spiegelman wanted to see the emptiness, and find the awful/awe-filled image of all that disappeared on 9/11. The silhouetted Twin Towers were printed in a fifth, black ink, on a field of black made up of the standard four color printing inks. An <b>overprinted</b> clear <b>varnish</b> helps create the ghost images that linger, insisting on their presence through the blackness.|$|R
5000|$|Spiegelman lived {{close to}} the World Trade Center site, which was known as [...] "Ground Zero" [...] after the September 11 attacks that {{destroyed}} the World Trade Center. Immediately following the attacks Spiegelman and Mouly rushed to their daughter Nadja's school, where Spiegelman's anxiety served only to increase his daughter's apprehensiveness over the situation. Spiegelman and Mouly created a cover for the September 24 issue of The New Yorker which at first glance appears to be totally black, but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of the World Trade Center towers in a slightly darker shade of black. Mouly positioned the silhouettes so that the North Tower's antenna breaks into the [...] "W" [...] of The New Yorkers logo. The towers were printed in black on a slightly darker black field employing standard four-color printing inks with an <b>overprinted</b> clear <b>varnish.</b> In some situations, the ghost images only became visible when the magazine was tilted toward a light source. Spiegelman was critical of the Bush administration and the mass media over their handling of the September 11 attacks.|$|R
