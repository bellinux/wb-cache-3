5|$|On 15 January 1898, J. Johnstone, {{a member}} of the Whiteinch Harriers running club, was killed while {{attempting}} to run across the line west of the station. A small lead memorial stood on the spot for many years. The freight line saw near-disaster on 28 December 1932, when seventeen wagons laden with coal ran away on a slight incline on the sidings operated by the Great Western Steam Laundry; they ran into <b>other</b> <b>wagons,</b> derailing nine and spilling coal over the line, seriously disrupting passenger traffic.|$|E
500|$|None of {{the party}} had any {{remaining}} faith in the Hastings Cutoff as they recovered at the springs {{on the other side}} of the desert. They spent several days trying to recover cattle, retrieve the wagons left in the desert, and transfer their food and supplies to <b>other</b> <b>wagons.</b> Reed's family incurred the heaviest losses, and Reed became more assertive, asking all the families to submit an inventory of their goods and food to him. He suggested that two men should go to Sutter's Fort in California; he had heard that John Sutter was exceedingly generous to wayward pioneers, and could assist them with extra provisions. Charles Stanton and William McCutchen volunteered to undertake the dangerous trip. The remaining serviceable wagons were pulled by mongrel teams of cows, oxen, and mules. It was the middle of September, and two young men who went in search of missing oxen reported that another [...] long stretch of desert lay ahead.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{not always}} {{necessary}} to replace the ballast if it is fouled, nor must all the ballast be removed {{if it is to}} be cleaned. Removing and cleaning the ballast from the shoulder is often sufficient, if shoulder ballast is removed to the correct depth. While this job was historically done by manual labour, this process is now, like many other railway maintenance tasks, a mechanised one, with a chain of specially-designed railroad cars handling the task. One wagon cuts the ballast and passes it via a conveyor belt to a cleaning machine, then the cleaning wagon washes the ballast, and deposits the dirt and ballast into <b>other</b> <b>wagons</b> for disposal and re-use, respectively. Such machines can clean up to [...] of ballast in an hour.|$|E

25|$|The CFC {{had over}} 500 freight wagons. Open wagons were on 10 tonnes capacity. <b>Other</b> <b>wagon</b> types {{included}} flat wagons, vans, tarpaulin wagons, tank and hopper wagons, {{as well as}} three cranes.|$|R
2500|$|The furnace {{operated}} {{twenty four}} hours a day, seven days a week, except for when it was closed for repairs. Cornwall Iron Furnace was capable of producing 24 tons of iron a week. [...] A large waterwheel powered the bellows. Carts loaded with charcoal passed to and fro between the coal barn and the furnace under a protective roof designed to keep the charcoal dry. <b>Other</b> <b>wagons</b> hauled the ore from the mine {{to the top of}} the furnace on the hillside. Workers then manually transported the charcoal and ore to the furnace. The guttermen worked at the base of the furnace. They raked the cooling sand and dug channels for the molten pig iron. Next, they stacked the bars of pig iron outside. The working conditions were very difficult. Temperatures inside the casting house reached as high as 160°F (71°C).|$|E
2500|$|Station wagon {{models for}} 1970 were offered {{initially}} {{in three different}} levels: the Fairlane 500 wagon, the Torino wagon, and the Torino Squire wagon. Mid-year 1970, the Falcon wagon became the new base station wagon. The sheetmetal on the station wagons was not changed as drastically as 2-door and 4-door models. The majority of the sheetmetal behind the front doors was carried over from the 1968-69 body style. As a result, the wagons appeared more upright and square than the sedans and coupes. The Torino Squire was the top level wagon and it featured simulated woodgrain sides, headlamp covers and a trim level similar to the Torino Brougham sedan. The Squire came standard with a 302-2V V8 engine, as well as power front disc brakes; <b>other</b> <b>wagons</b> had 4-wheel drums and the 250 CID I-6. All wagons still featured Ford's [...] "Magic Doorgate" [...] two-way tailgate, while the power rear window, rear-facing third seat and roof rack remained options. Ford offered a trailering towing package for all Torinos that would allow Torino to have a Class II tow rating (...) [...] This package included heavy-duty suspension, heavy-duty battery and alternator, extra cooling package, and power front disc brakes. The [...] or [...] engine, power steering and the Cruise-O-Matic transmission were required options.|$|E
2500|$|Steele {{had hoped}} to be resupplied from depots at Little Rock and Pine Bluff and to collect {{provisions}} from the countryside. He was denied significant resupply when Confederate cavalry forces of 1,700 troopers under Brigadier-General Marmaduke and 1,600 additional troopers under Brigadier-General Maxey overwhelmed a federal foraging expedition {{under the command of}} Colonel James M. Williams which would have been successful had it been able to return to Camden. The Confederates captured 170 wagons and teams from a 198-wagon supply train and destroyed the <b>other</b> <b>wagons</b> at the battle of Poison Spring, Arkansas. One source stated that the Confederates killed or captured [...] "most" [...] of the United States Army escort of 1,170 infantry and cavalry and four artillery pieces during the battle on April 18, 1864. Another source states that the U.S. forces lost 301 men, mostly killed or missing. The Confederates killed some African-American soldiers from the escort in this battle as they tried to surrender, according to reports from the field. About the time the remnants of the federal force who were not killed or captured at Poison Spring stumbled back into Camden, Steele learned that General Banks had turned back in his drive toward Shreveport after being defeated at the Battle of Mansfield, Louisiana (also known as Pleasant Grove or Sabine Cross Roads), about [...] from Shreveport, on April 8, 1864.|$|E

60|$|Thus {{muttering to}} himself the youth hunted up his {{overcoat}} and hat, put them on, and, lantern in hand, swung {{himself into the}} sea of half-submerged prairie grass, and stalked over to the <b>other</b> <b>wagon</b> just mentioned.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Other</b> <b>wagon</b> types {{included}} [...] "U" [...] skips for tunnelling, Granby cars, flat wagons, cane {{cars for}} sugar cane, carriages, kiln cars, timber bolsters, box cars. hopper wagons, anode and cathode cars, bottom discharge wagons, ammunition wagons, concrete pouring skip wagons. 1 ...|$|R
2500|$|Smith's Shaft was [...] {{into the}} {{footwall}} at the 90Fathom Level, {{so rather than}} extend it any deeper a new shaft was sunk from that level. This was an inclined shaft which followed the dip of the vein. It was sunk in 1910 from a point {{just north of the}} cross-cut at the bottom of Smith's Shaft and was known as the Skip Shaft. It was designed purely for haulage, although a ladderway was put in at the side. The skip was a large steel container with small wheels running on wooden guides. It was lowered to a chute below a working level and wagons of ore were tipped into it. It was then brought up to the 90Fathom Level, tipped up and the ore in it dropped into <b>other</b> <b>wagons</b> to be taken along the cross-cut to Smith's Shaft. The 105Fathom Level was developed from the Skip Shaft in 1911, and in 191718 the shaft was deepened to the 120Fathom Level. It worked well, {{but there was no way}} to get horses down to the lower levels, so tramming had to be done by hand. So in 1916 a new cage shaft, later to be known as Murray's Shaft, was begun by extending a sump from the 90Fathom Level, at a point [...] south of the cross-cut from Smith's Shaft. This was another inclined shaft, but it was designed for winding cages so wagons, men and horses could all travel up and down it. However work ceased in 1918 while it was still [...] short of the 120Fathom Level and no further work was done on it before the company went into liquidation in 1920.|$|E

60|$|We ate {{our dinner}} on the bare sod while all around us the birds of spring-time moved in myriads, and over the swells to the east <b>other</b> <b>wagons</b> laden with other land-seekers crept like {{wingless}} beetles--stragglers from the main skirmish line.|$|E
60|$|It was in {{this way}} that August and Hare fell far behind the <b>other</b> <b>wagons.</b> The nearer Naab got to his home the more genial he became. When he was not {{answering}} Hare's queries he was giving information of his own accord, telling about the cattle and the range, the mustangs, the Navajos, and the desert. Naab liked to talk; he had {{said he had not}} the gift of revelation, but he certainly had the gift of tongues.|$|E
60|$|The <b>other</b> <b>wagons</b> {{were brought}} across without mishap; but the dogs {{did not come}} with them. Jones called and called. The dogs howled and howled. Finally I waded out over the wet bars and little streams to a point several hundred yards nearer the dogs. Moze was lying down, but the others were whining and howling {{in a state of}} great perturbation. I called and called. They answered, and even ran into the water, but did not start across.|$|E
60|$|Pan {{entered the}} shop. It was open, like any <b>other</b> <b>wagon</b> shop with wood {{scattered}} about, shavings everywhere, a long bench laden with tools, a forge. Then he espied a man wielding a hammer on a wheel. His back was turned. But Pan knew him. Knew that back, that shaggy head {{beginning to turn}} gray, knew even the swing of arm! He approached leisurely. The moment seemed big, splendid.|$|R
60|$|Sam {{was led to}} {{the main}} floor of the ranch, and then without ado his hands were {{fastened}} behind him. Then {{he was told to}} march outside. Here two light wagons were in waiting, and he was bundled into one, along with Jimson and another man, and Dan Baxter. The <b>other</b> <b>wagon</b> was loaded with boxes and driven by two men. Several horses stood by, saddled for use.|$|R
50|$|Josiah Kelly and Andy {{separately}} {{made their}} way to the protection of a large wagon train some miles away, as did the people of the <b>other</b> <b>wagon</b> that had passed by. They later found William Larimer, with an arrow wound to the arm, and Wakefield with three arrows in him, but still alive. After a couple of days, the party made its way to Deer Creek Station, where there was an army garrison.|$|R
60|$|At {{the four}} corners below stood scores of <b>other</b> <b>wagons,</b> loaded to the rim with men, women and children. Up and down the line rode Milton Jennings, the marshal of the day, exalted by the baton he held and the gay red sash looped across his shoulders. Everywhere rose merry shouts, and far away {{at the head of}} the {{procession}} the Burr Oak band was playing. All waited for the flag whose beautiful folds flamed afar in the bright sunlight.|$|E
60|$|They {{left her}} alone, but sleep was impossible. The tramp of feet, {{the sound of}} pianos, the slam of doors, the singing, {{laughing}} of the other boarders made sleep impossible. The cars jangled by, the click-clack of horses' hoofs and the swift rattle of wagons kept up long after the house was silent. Between midnight and four o'clock she got a little sleep, out of which she awoke while a booming, clattering wagon thundered by. <b>Other</b> <b>wagons</b> clattered viciously along up the alleys, and then some early riser below began to sing, and Rose wearily dressed and sat down by the window to listen.|$|E
60|$|My {{father was}} the only one who had horses to his wagon. The wagons went in single file, and as the train wound and curved I saw that the <b>other</b> <b>wagons</b> were drawn by oxen. Three or four yoke of oxen {{strained}} and pulled weakly at each wagon, and beside them, in the deep sand, walked men with ox-goads, who prodded the unwilling beasts along. On a curve I counted the wagons ahead and behind. I knew that there were forty of them, including our own; for often I had counted them before. And as I counted them now, as a child will to while away tedium, they were all there, forty of them, all canvas-topped, big and massive, crudely fashioned, pitching and lurching, grinding and jarring over sand and sage- brush and rock.|$|E
5000|$|But for <b>other</b> <b>wagon</b> buyers, Ford {{also gave}} them two new choices that year, the first all-steel wagons in the firm's history. These were the Country Sedan, a four-door {{model in the}} {{mid-range}} Customline series; and the Ranch Wagon, which was a two-door model in the economy Mainline series, inspired by the European-term shooting-brake. The Ranch Wagon ran with either the standard [...] "Mileage Maker" [...] six-cylinder engine or the long-familiar flathead V8, which was optional.|$|R
6000|$|He {{was awakened}} {{by a series of}} wild yells, the {{snapping}} of whips and the furious rush of horses. It was another team filled with harvesters trying to pass, and not succeeding. The fellows in the <b>other</b> <b>wagon</b> hooted and howled and cracked the whip, but Al's little bays kept them behind until Lime protested, [...] "Oh, let 'em go, Al," [...] and then with a shout of glee the team went by and left them in a cloud of dust.|$|R
50|$|In 1881, Balzer's son John A. {{became a}} partner, {{and when the}} founder died in 1888, the son took over. In the early 1900s, as {{automobiles}} began to displace horses, the factory shifted operations to the manufacture of auto bodies, like many <b>other</b> <b>wagon</b> makers. In 1928 they added welding services and in 1934 auto body repair. The factory {{was used as a}} toy factory after World War II, then as a warehouse for many years. The founder's grandson, John A. Balzer Jr. operated a welding business in the showroom building into the 1970s.|$|R
6000|$|Plank Roads.--"Miry, boggy {{lines of}} road, along which {{people had been}} seen for months {{crawling}} like flies across a plate of treacle, are suddenly, and I may almost say magically, converted into a road as hard and good as Regent Street by the following simple process, which is usually adopted {{as soon as the}} feeble funds of the young colony can purchase the blessing. A small gang of men, with spades and rammers, quickly level one end of the earth road. As fast as they proceed, four or five rows of strong beams or sleepers, which have been brought in the light wagons of the country, are laid down longitudinally, four or five feet asunder; and no sooner are they in position than from <b>other</b> <b>wagons</b> stout planks, touching each other, are transversely laid upon them. From a third series of wagons, a thin layer of sand or grit is thrown upon the planks, which instantly assume the appearance of a more level McAdam road than in practice can ever be obtained. Upon this new-born road the wagons carrying the sleepers, planks, and sand, convey, with perfect ease, these three descriptions of materials for its continuance. The work advances literally about as fast as an old gouty gentleman can walk; and as soon as it is completed, there can scarcely exist a more striking contrast than between the two tenses of what it was and what it is. This 'plank road,' as it is termed in America, usually lasts from eight to twelve years; and as it is found quite unnecessary to spike the planks to the sleepers, the arrangement admits of easy repair, which, however, is but seldom required." [...] (Sir Francis Head, in Times, Jan. 25.) ...|$|E
60|$|By a {{succession}} of miracles with cheese-cloth, and sashes and ribbons, it was managed; and ended in a triumph so great that Mrs. Milray took the girl {{in her arms and}} kissed her for looking the Spirit of Summer to a perfection that the victim of the mumps could not have approached. The victory was not lastingly marred by the failure of Clementina's shoes to look the Spirit of Summer as well as the rest of her costume. No shoes at all world have been the very thing, but shoes so shabby and worn down at one side of the heel as Clementina's were very far from the thing. Mrs. Milray decided that another fold of cheese-cloth would add to the statuesque charm of her figure, and give her more height; and she was richly satisfied with the effect when the Middlemount coach drove up to the great veranda the next morning, with all the figures of her picture in position on its roof, and Clementina supreme among them. She herself mounted in simple, undramatized authority to her official seat beside the landlord, who in coachman's dress, with a bouquet of autumnal flowers in his lapel, sat holding his garlanded reins over the backs of his six horses; and then the coach as she intended it to appear in the parade set out as soon as the turnouts of the other houses joined it. They were all to meet at the Middlemount, which was thickly draped and festooned in flags, with knots of evergreen and the first red boughs of the young swamp maples holding them in place over its irregular facade. The coach itself was amass of foliage and flowers, from which it defined itself as a wheeled vehicle in vague and partial outline; the <b>other</b> <b>wagons</b> and coaches, as they drove tremulously up, with an effect of having been mired in blossoms about their spokes and hubs, had the unwieldiness which seems inseparable from spectacularity. They represented motives in color and design sometimes tasteless enough, and sometimes so nearly very good that Mrs. Milray's heart was a great deal in her mouth, as they arrived, each with its hotel-cry roared and shrilled from a score of masculine and feminine throats, and finally spelled for distinctness sake, with an ultimate yell or growl. But she had not finished giving the lady-representative of a Sunday newspaper the points of her own tableau, before she regained the courage and the faith in which she remained serenely steadfast throughout the parade.|$|E
