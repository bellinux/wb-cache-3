Express fares are 11.7 cents (per passenger-mile); locals are 5.5 cents. Within Taipei municipal zone, single trips are 58 cents regardless of distance/class. Unlike HSR, no time- or demand-based <b>off-peak</b> <b>discounts</b> are offered. Periodic (limited-ride) commutationtickets and multi-ride carnets are available. Fares are generally competitive with private commuter andintercity buses. Express trains operate with higher load factors {{and are more}} profitable.|$|R
25|$|In November 2009, TransLink {{introduced}} cashless tickets {{during peak}} times, only accepting only go cards and pre-purchased paper tickets {{in an effort}} to improve service efficiency. In late 2009, TransLink scrapped monthly and weekly paper tickets, with plans to eliminate paper tickets by the end of 2010. On 4 January 2010, to encourage the use of the go card, <b>off-peak</b> <b>discounts</b> and a direct debit top-up option were introduced. At the same time, TransLink increased fares and also announced fares would increase by a further 45% over the following three years.|$|R

40|$|Public {{transportation}} authorities {{across the}} world are implementing various peak and off-peak pricing strategies to manage travel demand and improve the overall system performance. In this study, an activity-based demand framework is used to evaluate two off-peak pricing policies currently in use in Singapore. These policies consist of a free pre-peak travel on MRT and an <b>off-peak</b> <b>discount</b> for an integrated transit (public buses and MRT). Smart card data collected {{before and after the}} implementation of the first policy was used to calibrate the behavioral models involved, in order to properly capture travelers' preferences and choices. To evaluate both pricing strategies, a comprehensive set of key performance indicators was considered, including the changes in peak ridership, average trip fare, operator's revenue, the number of public transportation trips and mode share. The results indicate that <b>off-peak</b> <b>discount</b> pricing strategies are a viable policy option for spreading demand peaks, and that they are more effective in the afternoon peak. This study also demonstrates the capabilities and the advantages of an agent-based modeling platform SimMobility as a tool for policy analysis...|$|E

40|$|States are {{increasingly}} using toll roads {{as a means}} of financing transportation capital needs as well as expanding transportation system capacity. Whether toll roads can attract trucks partially determines the performance of the investment. Unfortunately, the low profit margin in the trucking industry and the relatively high tolls truckers pay leads to their reluctance to use toll facilities. Incentives for truck use of a toll road, State Highway 130 (SH 130) near Austin, Texas, were analyzed in this research. As a parallel toll road to the non-tolled, congested facility Interstate 35 (I- 35), SH 130 was projected to carry a lot of traffic, including a significant proportion of trucks. In order to make this tolled facility more attractive to trucks, innovative incentives were considered. The potential truck demand for SH 130 and their potential reactions to the incentives were estimated in this research based on survey data. According to survey responses, different groups of the trucking industry had very different characteristics. Due to the variation of the characteristics among different categories of trucks, truckers? travel behavior and incentive preference were also different by trucking group. Compared with other groups of truckers, smaller companies (owner-operators) were the least likely to use SH 130, while private carriers were the most likely to use SH 130. It was also found many truckers had already made adjustments both to their time and route to avoid traveling in congested conditions. Among all the categories of truckers, for-hire truckers had the least flexibility. The average value of travel time savings of trucks around the Austin area was $ 44. 20 per hour. As the price of travel time savings went up, the percentage of truckers using SH 130 decreased. Price-related incentives were discovered to be most popular with truckers. Among all of the price-related incentives, <b>off-peak</b> <b>discounts</b> and a free trip after a number of paid trips were the most popular incentives...|$|R

From relatively small-scale settings such as restaurants to massive venues such as cruise ships and theme parks, managers {{face the same}} questions, such as: How can the service create the most revenue from a limited space and still keep the guests satisfied?; Should the business promote <b>off-peak</b> use at <b>discount</b> prices, add more capacity (at the risk of making guests feel crowded), or target marketing campaigns to those customer groups that might take advantage of underused facilities?; and Should the firm implement automated reservation technology to control queues for a ride or attraction...|$|R
