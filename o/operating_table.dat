5|$|Black Christmas {{has three}} {{alternate}} endings, {{the second of}} which {{was used as the}} actual ending for the UK theatrical release of the movie. In the UK ending, Billy dies on the <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> from his wounds, thus when Kelli kills Agnes, the scene ends there with her parents picking her up from the hospital. The third ending is similar, having Billy die and Kelli's parents picking her up, however his body disappears and the last shot shows someone moving through the vents, indicating that either Agnes or Billy are still alive. The first ending, which follows the original script, ends with both Kelli and Leigh surviving and Kelli getting a call from someone using Kyle's cellphone.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, Negus {{worked on}} aspects of both throat surgery and {{the anatomy of}} the larynx, the latter work {{contributing}} to his degree of Master of Surgery (1924). His surgical innovations included designs for laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes, oesophagoscopes, an <b>operating</b> <b>table,</b> and tracheotomy equipment. His major publications were The Mechanism of the Larynx (1929) and {{his work on the}} clinical text Diseases of the Nose and Throat, starting with the fourth edition of 1937. Negus was also awarded several lectureships and published many medical papers and other works on comparative anatomy and laryngology. He became a senior surgeon at King's College Hospital in 1940 and a consulting surgeon in 1946.|$|E

5|$|On 14 February 1942, seeking {{reprisal}} {{for their}} great loss and also retaliation against retreating {{soldiers from the}} 44th Indian Brigade who had fired from Alexandra Hospital, 3 groups of Japanese soldiers went on a blind rampage and entered the hospital from the rear bayoneting everyone they found, {{regardless of whether they}} were soldiers, patients and medical staff. They killed a British officer, Lieutenant W.E.J. Weston, who was carrying a white flag to meet them. Even a young patient, Corporal Holden, who was lying on an <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> was not spared. About 200 defenceless souls were massacred. Some managed to escape death by falling to the floor and pretending to be dead.|$|E
5|$|When the {{announcer}} {{at the ball}} asks {{if there is a}} doctor in the house, Mac puts his hand up, to Caroline's embarrassment. Things get more embarrassing when Guy also volunteers, and asks why Caroline is sitting next to Mac when she is Guy's fiancée. A unconscious patient lies on an <b>operating</b> <b>table.</b> Guy touches her breasts, takes pictures of her naked body under the blanket, and kisses her. Caroline alleges that the patient is transgender, which repels Guy. Sue White then appears in a tutu, claiming that the patient is stalking Mac, and repeating the assertion that the patient is transgender.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{still early}} in his {{surgical}} career, Negus took {{a different approach to}} that which was common at the time. Rather than be apprenticed to a leading surgeon in his ENT (ear, nose and throat) speciality, he undertook basic research on the structure of the larynx that would lead to a higher degree in 1924 and the publication of books and papers on the topic in later years. While engaged in this research, Negus continued his work at King's College Hospital, being appointed junior surgeon in 1924. It was during this period, following his return from the USA, that Negus both promoted the methods and tools he had seen used in Philadelphia by Jackson, and worked to improve the designs of the endoscopes and other equipment used in ENT surgery. These instruments, developed in collaboration with the Genito-Urinary Company of London, included laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes (such as the Negus bronchoscope) and oesophagoscopes. Other surgical innovations developed by Negus included an <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> (known as the King's College table), and a speaking valve for use in tracheotomy tubes. He also helped develop strategies for treatments of throat cancer to aid the choice between surgery and radiotherapy.|$|E

5|$|On 7 June, the {{battleship}} received {{word that the}} Ranger battalion at Pointe Du Hoc was still isolated {{from the rest of}} the invasion force with low ammunition and mounting casualties; in response, Texas obtained and filled two LCVPs with provisions and ammunition for the Rangers. Upon their return, the LCVPs brought thirty-five wounded Rangers to Texas for treatment of which one died on the <b>operating</b> <b>table.</b> Along with the Rangers, a deceased Coast Guard sailor and twenty-seven prisoners (twenty Germans, four Italians, and three French) were brought to the ship. The prisoners were fed, segregated, and not formally interrogated aboard Texas, due to the ship bombarding targets or standing by to bombard, before being loaded aboard an LST for transfer to England. Later in the day, her main battery rained shells on the enemy-held towns of Formigny and Trévières to break up German troop concentrations. That evening, she bombarded a German mortar battery that had been shelling the beach. Not long after midnight, German planes attacked the ships offshore, and one of them swooped in low on Texass starboard quarter. Her anti-aircraft batteries opened up immediately but failed to hit the intruder. On the morning of 8 June, her guns fired on Isigny, then on a shore battery, and finally on Trévières once more.|$|E

25|$|The {{measures}} of the bust — A liposuction mammoplasty procedure does not feature a surgical-incision plan delineated upon the woman's breasts, chest, and torso. Yet the {{measures of}} the bust are established {{in order to determine}} the required degree(s) of correction; thus, with the patient sitting erect, for each breast, the surgeon records the jugular-notch-to-nipple distances, the nipple-to-inframammary-fold distances, and any asymmetries. Afterwards, the anaesthetized patient is laid supine upon the <b>operating</b> <b>table,</b> with her arms laterally extended (abducted) in order to fully expose the breasts.|$|E

25|$|As he {{specialized}} in certain gynecological surgeries (particularly hemorrhoidectomies and ovariotomies) and gastrointestinal surgeries, he developed various instruments for these operations including specialized hooks and retractors, a heated <b>operating</b> <b>table,</b> and an aseptic drainage tube used in abdominal surgery. Additionally, Kellogg took {{keen interest in}} devising instruments for light therapy, mechanical exercising, proper breathing, and pure water. His medical inventions spanned {{a wide range of}} applications and included a hot air bath, vibrating chair, oscillomanipulator, window tent for fresh air, pneumograph to graphically represent respiratory habits, loofah mitt, and apparatus for home sterilization of milk.

25|$|For the {{treatment}} of trauma patients every minute counts. Patients with severe bleedings after car accidents, explosions, gunshot wounds or aortic dissections, etc. need immediate care due to the life-threatening blood loss. In a hybrid operating room both open and endovascular treatment of the patient can be performed. For example, {{the tension in the}} brain due to a severe haemorrhage can be relieved and the aneurysm can be coiled. The concept of placing the emergency patient on an <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> as soon as he/she enters the hospital, if stable perform a trauma scan in the CT or if instable immediate procedure in the hybrid operating room without having to reposition the patient can save valuable time and reduce risk of further injury.|$|E
25|$|Thackston {{lost control}} of his vehicle while exiting at the Opryland exit on Briley Parkway at a speed of 55 miles per hour; the exit ramp was posted for 25 miles per hour. The car left the ramp, went {{airborne}} and struck the central division. West {{did not believe that}} she was as badly injured as her neighbor had been and insisted he be treated first. Officers who responded to the scene incorrectly reported that she did not seem harmed at the time. West herself was under the same impression, however she suffered severe internal injuries and proved to have suffered both a ruptured spleen and a lacerated liver. Her spleen was removed that Friday and, the following Monday, she underwent two more surgeries to stop her liver from bleeding; these ultimately failed in that effort. Doctors said that West knew the extent of her injuries and even visited with Kenny Rogers shortly before her last operation. On September 4, 1991, during her third operation, West died on the <b>operating</b> <b>table</b> at 9:43a.m., at the age of 58.|$|E

30|$|Like Stomberg et al. (2010), {{we found}} that females {{were much more likely}} to suffer {{musculoskeletal}} distress than their male colleagues [1]. This difference in prevalence between the sexes has been attributed to the fact that women have a lower muscle mass in the upper extremities when compared with men. As the monitor is often placed on top of a trolley of fixed height, this would disadvantage a shorter surgeon, likely a female whose neck would be extended in viewing the monitor, leading ultimately to neck strain. In addition, as <b>operating</b> <b>tables</b> have traditionally been designed for open surgery, they are not optimal for laparoscopic procedures with the lowest height that most <b>operating</b> <b>tables</b> can be lowered to being only 725  mm, again disadvantaging the usually shorter female surgeon [8]. As our survey shows that female trainees are significantly shorter than their male counterparts, they will be automatically exposed to a greater risk of musculoskeletal injury during laparoscopic procedures.|$|R
