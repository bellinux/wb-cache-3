5|$|Manufacturers and {{academics}} have conducted studies and experiments {{in an effort}} to improve the stretchiness, melting characteristics, browning, fat content and water retention <b>of</b> <b>pizza</b> cheese. Several patents exist for specialized varieties <b>of</b> <b>pizza</b> cheese and for its processing. A study by Rudan and Barbano found that the addition of a thin layer of vegetable oil atop low- and reduced-fat pizza cheese increased meltability and reduced browning and dehydration when the product was cooked, but the texture remained overly chewy and tough. A study by Perry et al. found various methods to heighten the melt of low-fat pizza cheese by increasing its moisture, including the use of pre-acidification, fat-replacers, and exopolysaccharide starter cultures as well as higher pasteurization temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Mass-produced {{pizza cheese}} {{is used by}} the foodservice industry, quick service restaurants, and other {{industries}} and businesses. The world's largest manufacturer <b>of</b> <b>pizza</b> cheese, Leprino Foods Company, processes 600,000 tonnes (590,000 long tons; 660,000 short tons, 1,322,760,000 pounds) a year. Leprino Foods holds patents for some specialized Mozzarella production processes that enable the quick manufacture of the product. One such product is a frozen shredded cheese used for pizza that is created in a few hours from milk. Other U.S. companies also mass-produce pizza cheese, which is shipped in a frozen state. As of 2000, Glanbia is the largest producer <b>of</b> <b>pizza</b> cheese in Europe. Some retail and commercially mass-produced frozen pizzas have cheese stuffed into the pizza crust.|$|E

Tazz was the host and Maria and Melina were the judges. In order to win the competition, one competitor had to eat more slices <b>of</b> <b>pizza</b> than the opponent in two minutes. Hardy finished two slices in the time limit and then proceeded to vomit on MVP, who didn't finish any, which won Hardy the competition.|$|E

5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to {{the production}} of cream cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types <b>of</b> <b>pizza</b> cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{production}} and consumption of Mozzarella and pizza cheese steadily increased in the mid-20th century, and this trend has continued into {{the first decade of}} the 21st century. In the U.S., several hundred million pounds <b>of</b> <b>pizza</b> cheese is consumed annually. In 1997, it was estimated that annual production of the product was 1 million tons (2 billion pounds) in the United States and 100,000 tonnes (98,000 long tons; 110,000 short tons, 220,460,000 pounds) in Europe. It has been estimated that 30% of all pizza cheese used in the United States is Mozzarella cheese. As of 2000, demand for the product was growing in Europe by 8 percent per year.|$|E

A slice <b>of</b> <b>pizza</b> {{had been thrown}} at Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson by Cesc Fàbregas, which was {{initially}} unconfirmed until 13 years after the incident. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was furious in his post-match briefing, criticising Riley for his performance and describing Van Nistelrooy as a cheat. His comments were investigated by the Football Association, who later fined him £15,000 for improper conduct. Van Nistelrooy was retroactively banned for three matches as his challenge on Cole was missed by Riley.|$|E

5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice <b>of</b> <b>pizza,</b> for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants.

5|$|Pizza cheese {{encompasses}} several {{varieties and}} types of cheeses and dairy products that are designed and manufactured for use specifically on pizza. These include processed and modified cheese such as mozzarella-like processed cheeses and mozzarella variants. The term can also refer to any type of cheese suitable for use on pizza. The most popular cheeses used in the preparation <b>of</b> <b>pizza</b> are mozzarella (accounting for about 30%), provolone, cheddar and Parmesan. Emmental, Romano and ricotta are often used as toppings, and processed pizza cheeses manufactured specifically for pizza are mass-produced. Some mass-produced pizza cheeses are frozen after manufacturing and shipped frozen.|$|E
5|$|Processed {{pizza cheese}} is {{manufactured}} to produce optimal qualities in browning, melting, stretchiness and fat and moisture content. Several studies and experiments have analyzed {{the impact of}} vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins and other changes to create ideal and economical pizza cheeses. In 1997, {{it was estimated that}} annual production <b>of</b> <b>pizza</b> cheese products was 2 billion pounds in the United States and 200 million pounds in Europe, and in 2000 demand for the product in Europe was increasing by 8% per year.

5|$|In {{addition}} to those in Italian Food, there are many Italian recipes and descriptions {{of the land and}} the people in David's other works. The first recipe in her first book, Mediterranean Food—soupe au Pistou—is of Genoese origin. Also in that book are recipes for bocconcini, osso bucco, and several Italian pasta and chicken dishes. Among the recipes in Summer Cooking is peperonata (pimentos or sweet peppers cooked with tomatoes in olive oil and butter) which was reprinted as the title article in a later selection from David's works. In An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, David printed Italian recipes including soups and omelettes made with hops (zuppa di lupolli and frittata con i loertis). Also in that book are substantial essays on Italian people and places. Is There a Nutmeg in the House? includes a six-page article on vegetable dishes from Mantua, and another of similar length on the variations <b>of</b> <b>pizza</b> in Italy and beyond.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers aim for a {{moisture}} content of 50-to-52 percent and a fat-in-dry-matter content of 35-to-40 percent. A {{study published in}} the International Journal of Food & Science Technology found that a 12.5:87.5 blend of vetch milk and bovine milk improved stretchiness and melting characteristics. Vetch is a legume that has seeds which are similar to lentils. An experiment published in the International Journal of Dairy Technology suggested that the level of galactose, a monosaccharide sugar that is less sweet than glucose and fructose, can be reduced using different culture techniques. An article in the International Journal of Food Engineering found that trisodium citrate, a food additive used to preserve and add flavor to foods, slightly improved the preferred qualities <b>of</b> <b>pizza</b> cheese. Research published in Dairy Industries International suggested that denatured whey proteins increased moisture retention, but that the improvements were very slight and not economically worthwhile relative to the minor improvements.|$|E
