The zoo has bred their lions on multiple occasions, including one male and two females born in January 2010 and three males and one female born in August 2013. The zoo, in partnership with the NY Daily News, held a contest to name the 2010 cubs, which made their public debut in April 2010.

50|$|Larger {{groups may}} have a greater overall {{vigilance}} than small groups due to the ‘many eyes’ hypothesis: more eyes scanning for predators means {{that the proportion of}} time that at least one individual is vigilant (collective vigilance) is higher. This improved vigilance may allow an individual to decrease the time it allocates to vigilance without any increase in its personal risk of being attacked - particularly as large groups already have a diluted predation risk. Lower individual levels of vigilance with increasing group size has been observed in many bird, mammal and fish species. Individual <b>ostriches</b> (<b>Struthio</b> <b>camelus)</b> and greater rheas (Rhea americana) in large groups both spend less time with their head up than individuals in small groups, however collective vigilance increases with group size in ostriches but not rheas. Therefore, the many eyes hypothesis does not always hold. Although individuals in groups may be able to decrease the time they spend scanning, and hence reach their energy requirements in a shorter period of time, the increased competition for food in groups may mean that animals need to devote more time overall to foraging due to an increased allocation of time for aggressive behaviour during foraging. For example, the rate of fighting between house sparrows (Passer domesticus) increases with the size of the flock.|$|E
50|$|The {{kori bustard}} is {{often found in}} areas with a large {{quantity}} of antelope and other game. In Tanzania, kori bustards regularly attend blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) herds and feed on the small mammals and insects disturbed by them. Sometimes kori bustards are found with southern carmine bee-eaters (Merops nubicoides) and northern carmine bee-eaters (Merops nubicus) riding on their backs as they stride through the grass. The bee-eaters {{make the most of}} their walking perch by hawking insects from the bustard's back that are disturbed by the bustard's wandering. This is regularly seen in Chobe National Park, Botswana but has only been reported once elsewhere. There is also one record of fork-tailed drongos (Dicrurus adsimilis) perching on their backs in a similar manner. Kori bustards have been observed to behave aggressively to non-threatening animals at watering holes, as they may raise their crests, open their wings and peck aggressively. They have been seen acting aggressively towards red-crested korhaans (Eupodotis ruficrista), springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis), plains zebra (Equus quagga), and gemsbok (Oryx gazella). When kept in captivity, kori bustards have been kept together with numerous other (typically African) species in close quarters. Fifteen other bird species and 12 mammals have successfully co-habitated with them (including rhinoceros). However, the bustards sometimes injure or kill the young of everything from waterfowl to dik-diks and may be killed by larger species from <b>ostriches</b> (<b>Struthio</b> <b>camelus)</b> to zebras (Equus spp.).|$|E

50|$|Wading birds, even {{large and}} {{relatively}} slow-moving types {{such as the}} goliath heron (Ardea goliath), tend to be highly cautious about avoiding deep water in crocodile occupied wetlands whereas cormorants and waterfowl forage over deeper water and are easier for crocodiles to ambush, with Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca) and spur-winged geese (Plectropterus gambensis) recorded as being taken largely while flightless due to molting their flight feathers. On the contrary, there are several records of them capturing wading birds. Guggisberg (1972) saw multiple cases of predation on marabou storks (Leptoptilos crumenifer) and around Lake Turkana several may frequent heronries to pick off fledglings. In one case, a crocodile was filmed capturing a striated heron (Butorides striata) in mid-flight. Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) {{are known to be}} grabbed while they dive for fish as are possibly African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer) while crowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) have reportedly been ambushed on land at carrion. Crocodiles are occasionally successful in grabbing passerines such as weaver birds, including the abundant red-billed quelea (Quelea quelea), and swallows, having been observed to breach the water and {{in a matter of seconds}} sweep off a branch full of birds with remarkable success. Larger land birds, such as bustards, guineafowl, ground hornbills (Bucorvus sp.) and <b>ostriches</b> (<b>Struthio</b> <b>camelus),</b> may be taken when they come to water to drink but like most birds are seldom harassed and a minor part of the diet.|$|E

50|$|Various upland birds {{recorded}} as prey include the 177 g Namaqua sandgrouse (Pterocles namaqua), the 350 g rock pigeon (Columba livia), the 84 g laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis), the 169 g Senegal coucal (Centropus senegalensis), the 49 g scaly-throated honeyguide (Indicator variegatus) and {{several species of}} hornbill, {{ranging in size from}} the 139 g northern red-billed hornbill (Tockus erythrorhynchus) to the 1235 g silvery-cheeked hornbill (Bycanistes brevis). Among passerines, the most frequently taken are likely to be corvids, which are often favored by Bubo owls from around the world due to their large size, relatively open nests and frequently easy-to-find, communal nocturnal roosts. To date the cape crow (Corvus capensis) and pied crow (Corvus albus) are the corvids reported in dietary studies but in Ethiopia thick-billed ravens (Corvus crassirostris), which at 1500 g are possible the heaviest corvid species in the world, mobbed them vigorously and seemed to consider them a primary threat. Smaller passerines are by no means ignored. White-eyes are among the more frequently taken smaller passerines, with the 10.9 g African yellow white-eye (Zosterops senegalensis) being the smallest identified avian prey species, although penduline tits (Anthoscopus ssp.) (thus far unidentified to species) are likely to be even smaller. The largest bird to be hunted to Verreaux's eagle-owl is {{complicated by the fact that}} they often take relatively small nestlings of larger species, such as <b>ostriches</b> (<b>Struthio</b> <b>camelus)</b> and grey crowned cranes (Balearica regulorum). The only avian prey items successfully attacked larger than other types of birds of prey (reviewed later) are likely bustards. Most predation records have reported on relatively small bustards, namely northern (Afrotis afraoides) and southern black korhaans (Afrotis afra), which average only 745 g and 690 g, respectively. Larger species of bustard thought to be threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owl are the 4790 g Denham's bustard (Neotis denhami) and the 8430 g kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), although it is not clear whether adults (especially males) are attacked in the latter species.|$|E

40|$|The study {{includes}} separate papers, {{which are}} all linked by their emphasis {{on the effect of}} different diets on the impact of the development of the small intestine of the young ostrich. This abstract is intended to provide readers with a broad overview of the outcomes of the study. Part 1 : Yolk utilisation and the development of the small intestines Chapter 2 deals with the composition of egg yolk as it is absorbed by starved <b>ostrich</b> <b>Struthio</b> <b>camelus</b> L.) chicks from one to seven days post-hatching and for <b>ostrich</b> (<b>Struthio</b> <b>camelus</b> L.) chicks from one to sixteen days post-hatching on a pre-starter broiler diet. Chapter 3 provides information on the intestinal enzymes of <b>ostrich</b> (<b>Struthio</b> <b>camelus</b> L.) chicks from one to sixteen days post-hatching on a pre-starter broiler diet. The effect of growth on enzyme activity immediately post-hatching up to sixteen days of age was studied. Chapter 4 details a histological and morphological study of the gastrointestinal tract of <b>ostrich</b> (<b>Struthio</b> <b>camelus</b> L.) chicks from two to sixteen days post-hatching on a pre-starter broiler diet. The effect of growth on histological and morphological changes in the various parts of the small intestines was examined. Part 2 : Influence on various pre-starter diets on growth and the development of the intestinal tract Chapter 5 discussed a growth and digestibility study of <b>ostrich</b> (<b>Struthio</b> <b>camelus</b> L.) chicks on eight different pre-starter diets. The performance, growth and physiological development of the chicks on high and low variations of different nutritional components were examined. Chapter 6 provides information on certain intestinal enzymes of <b>ostrich</b> (<b>Struthio</b> <b>camelus</b> L.) chicks on the eight different pre-starter diets. Chapter 7 dealt with the histological and morphological changes of the gastrointestinal tract of <b>ostrich</b> (<b>Struthio</b> <b>camelus</b> L.) chicks as a result of high and low variations of different nutritional components in prestarter diets. Implications The first part of this study revealed that although it appeared that yolk content was absorbed faster in starved ostrich chicks, intake of external feed had a positive influence on the absorption of fat from the yolk. The changes in the fatty acid composition of the yolk fat content that were observed may indicate that ostrich chicks have the ability to withdraw certain fatty acid components, especially unsaturated fatty acids. The digestive tract of ostrich chicks was compared with that of broiler chicks and differences observed in amylase and lipase activity between the birds in this trial and in poultry could be due to genetic differences between species. It could also be due to the genetic homogeneity of the poultry chicks that were used in the trials, whereas ostrich chicks have not been subjected to the same extent of advanced breeding improvement to date. Results on histological and morphological growth of the small intestines of the ostrich chick indicate increased absorption with an increase in age. The second part of this study revealed that ostrich chicks performed differently on diets formulated with different nutritional components. It appears that a high fat and low sugar content in the diet is advantageous in ostrich pre-starter diets. Although there were a few mortalities during the trials, there is no clear indication as to why the chicks died, as the causes of mortalities were not investigated. Differences in composition of the eight pre-starter diets did not seem to have an influence on the protein content or enzyme activity of the small intestines of ostrich chicks. An anti-nutritional factor within certain feedstuffs may, however, have had an influence on enzyme activity. Similar results were obtained for the histological and morphological parameters which were measured in chicks fed the different diets. There was no single diet that promoted intestine development, although {{it seemed as if the}} small intestines of the chicks fed the high protein diet were under higher digestive stress than those of the chicks fed the other diets.
