Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. <b>Laminated</b> <b>glass</b> is comprised of multiple plates of glass bonded together with polymorphous interlayers. The interest in the use of architectural <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> in the construction industry has increased due to its possible advantages over monolithic glass. Some of the advantageous properties of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> include a greater impact resistance, improved sound resistance, and better thermal insulation inside the structure. The most important advantage of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> as compared to monolithic glass is its improved safety. Should failure of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> occur, the interlayer would adhere to the surrounding glass plates. This would prevent the glass from shattering and potentially harming any inhabitants of the structure. Although these advantages are generally accepted, the performance of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> is highly disputed. Of particular interest are the performance of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> at various temperatures and its response to loading over a duration of time. There are two primary objectives of this thesis. First, the effect of temperature on the elastic bending stiffness of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> with a polyvinyl butyral (PVB) based interlayer is to be resolved. The creep response with respect to temperature will also be observed. Second, the design method for <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> will be evaluated. This includes determining the effectiveness of the existing models of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass.</b> This investigation will include typical three point loading on two types of architectural <b>laminated</b> <b>glass.</b> These tests will be conducted at various temperatures to determine the effect of temperature on the bending of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass.</b> The results of these experiments show that temperature is the most influential property in the determination of the behavior of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> beams. It is shown in this thesis that at cold temperatures, <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> approaches the performance of the true monolithic model. Furthermore, it is shown that at hot temperatures, <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> is bound by the performance of the layered model. The results of this thesis indicate that a return to the traditional design procedure is warranted until further research is conducted...|$|R

More specifically, failure modes and residual load-bearing capacity of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> are of particular interest as they are essential to design a fully safe glass structure. In this context, several examples and their corresponding experimental assessments are discussed. First, a real failure case of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> panels is presented with a focus on the experimental investigation, including residual glass stress measurements by means of scattered light polariscope.

A new higher order finite element model (presented by the first two authors) using 9 -noded quadrilateral elements was applied to investigate <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> plates with both different interlayer materials. An experimental load-testing program is described. Two types of interlayer materials, regular polyvinyl butyral and strong formulation of polyvinyl butyral were used. First, simply supported rectangular <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> plates with regular polyvinyl butyral interlayer with aspect ratios 1 – 5 under different temperatures were tested. Second, one set of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> plates with the strong formulation of polyvinyl butyral interlayer was tested under room temperature. The experimental and theoretical results are compared and discussed. In general, the performance of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> with regular polyvinyl butyral interlayer is closer to that of layered glass at higher temperature. Also, <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> with strong formulation of polyvinyl butyral interlayer has a significantly larger load resistance than similar regular polyvinyl butyral samples...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBlast {{resistant}} glazing systems typically use <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> {{to reduce}} the risk of flying glass debris in the event of an explosion. <b>Laminated</b> <b>glass</b> has one or more bonded polymer interlayers to retain glass fragments upon fracture. With good design, the flexibility of the interlayer and the adhesion between layers enable <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> to continue to resist blast after the glass layers fracture. This gives protection from significantly higher blast loads when compared to a monolithic pane. Full-scale open-air blast tests were performed on <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> containing a polyvinyl butyral (PVB) interlayer. Test windows of size 1. 5 m× 1. 2 m were secured to robust frames using structural silicone sealant. Blast loads were produced using charge masses of 15 kg and 30 kg (TNT equivalent) at distances of 10 – 16 m. Deflection and shape measurements of deforming <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> were obtained using high-speed digital image correlation. Measurements of loading at the joint, between the <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> and the frame, were obtained using strain gauges. The main failure mechanisms observed were the cohesive failure of the bonded silicone joint and delamination between the glass and interlayer at the pane edge.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Laminated</b> <b>glass</b> {{plate or}} beam {{used in the}} {{building}} industry is an architectural unit of the building formed by two or more thin glass plates or beams bonded together by an interlayer PVB (polyvinyl butyral). The behavior of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> beams is complicated because the different materials have different elastic modulus. <b>Laminated</b> <b>glass</b> is very thin and can easily undergo large displacements, therefore, the equilibrium equations governing their behavior {{should be based on}} large deflection theory. In the present study, the effect of boundary conditions on the vibration of a <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> unit is investigated by considering the cases of simply supported and fixed supported <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> beams. Glass units considered in this study have two thin glass beams and an interlayer PVB. A mathematical model for the dynamic behavior of a <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> beam is developed using variational principles. The assumptions of the classical beam theory are valid. Three coupled partial differential equations which express the dynamic behavior are obtained for lateral and axial displacements.

Stochastic initial damage distribution and node splitting was defined for the glass material. In the blast model, node splitting was also introduced in the interlayer to enable plastic deformation. Delamination between glass and interlayer was seen in quasi-static experiments, but could not be detected in dynamically loaded panes. For the case of 3 -point bend loading of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass,</b> good correlation was found between numerical predictions and experimental observations.

40|$|<b>Laminated</b> <b>glass</b> is {{comprised}} of multiple glass plates coupled together in a sandwich construction {{through the use of}} a polymorphous interlayer that acts as a bonding agent between the <b>glass</b> plates. <b>Laminated</b> <b>glass</b> offers several advantages over monolithic glass including the ability to resist post fracture collapse, improved sound insulation, lower ultraviolent light trans-mission, and improved thermal insulation. Because the stiffness of the interlayer is often many orders of magnitude less than that of the glass, plane sections prior to loading do not remain plane throughout the laminate?s thickness after load is applied. The behavior of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> is controlled by the stiffness of the interlayer. This behavior rules out the use of classical theoretical formulations for thin plates. In such cases, it is necessary to use specially formulated equations or finite element analyses to evaluate the performance of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass.</b> Previous attempts have been made to develop procedures to quantify the interlayer stiffness for use in <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> design. However, there is no widely accepted technique that can be referenced for use. It is known that the interlayer stiffness is a function of both temperature and load duration. The primary objective of this thesis is to formalize a standard procedure to estimate the in situ interlayer shear modulus through the use of nondestructive testing. Physical experiments were carried out on simply supported <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> beams subject to three point loading in a temperature controlled environmental testing chamber.
