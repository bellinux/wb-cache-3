5|$|A {{series of}} {{incidents}} in 2009 led to Church of Scientology-owned networks being banned from making edits to Wikipedia articles relating to Scientology. The Church of Scientology {{has long had}} a controversial history on the Internet, and has initiated campaigns to manipulate material and remove information critical of itself from the web. From early in Wikipedia's history, conflict arose within the topic of Scientology on the website. Disputes began in earnest in 2005, with users disagreeing {{about whether or not}} to describe Scientology as an abusive cult <b>or</b> <b>religion.</b> By 2006, disagreements concerning the topic of Scientology on Wikipedia had grown more specific. Wikipedia user and Scientology critic David Gerard commented to The Daily Telegraph in 2006 that some articles were neutral due to a requirement to reference stated facts.|$|E
5|$|Etty did not base The Combat on {{any single}} {{incident}} from history or literature, or on any existing artwork, {{but on his}} own imagination; this was a highly unusual step to take regarding history paintings, which generally depicted themes from literature <b>or</b> <b>religion.</b> He had been considering the topic as early as 1821, and his plans took shape following his visit to Italy. During this visit Etty had met Antonio Canova and been very impressed by him; The Combat is clearly influenced by his work. As well as drawing inspiration from classical sculpture, he was also strongly influenced by the composition of Old Master works he had seen while in Italy. As with many of Etty's works, the models posed for him separately in his studio, {{rather than as a}} group.|$|E

5|$|In a {{parliamentary}} speech on 28 February 2008, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng {{said that the}} Government had adjusted its policies in relation to various types of expression. For instance, in 2000 it had created Speakers' Corner as an outdoor venue for political speeches. Use of this venue was liberalized in 2004 to include performances and exhibitions. All public talks held indoors involving organizers and speakers who are Singapore citizens are also exempted from the licensing requirements of the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act. However, {{freedom of speech and}} expression, though characteristic and imperative in a self-professed democracy, is not unfettered. The Government thus continues to require licences for events where the speeches relate to race <b>or</b> <b>religion,</b> and does not permit outdoor demonstrations to be held.|$|E

5|$|Much of Raël's {{advocacy}} concerning futuristic {{technology is}} described in his 2001 book, Yes to Human Cloning. He supported human genetic engineering {{in order to avoid}} genetically inherited diseases and to reduce the economic burden on society. He said that no distinctive emphasis needed to be allocated to a particular race <b>or</b> <b>religion.</b> Elsewhere in the book, he stated that nanotechnology will make it possible to have micro-distributive power generation (essentially a power plant in each house), fur-like furnishings that are self-cleaning with hair-like fibers that move on their own, and biological robots. Nanostructures control biology, so Raël expected that meat and salads will someday be grown in a machine via molecular construction.|$|E

5|$|Widespread {{segregation}} in 19th- and early 20th-century North America {{made it difficult}} for African-Americans to join Lodges outside of Prince Hall jurisdictions– and impossible for inter-jurisdiction recognition between the parallel U.S. Masonic authorities. By the 1980s, such discrimination was a thing of the past, and today most U.S. Grand Lodges recognise their Prince Hall counterparts, and the authorities of both traditions are working towards full recognition. The United Grand Lodge of England has no problem with recognising Prince Hall Grand Lodges. While celebrating their heritage as lodges of black Americans, Prince Hall is open to all men regardless of race <b>or</b> <b>religion.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Nathaniel Branden {{established}} Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), {{to promote}} Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited. Rand later published {{some of these}} articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult <b>or</b> <b>religion.</b> Rand expressed opinions {{on a wide range}} of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers. However, some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated, with the problem being concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York. Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.|$|E
