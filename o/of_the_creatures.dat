5|$|The {{artificial}} {{intelligence of the}} game's enemies, the Aliens, was regarded as lacking, and one reviewer noted that their blood was not acidic, a defining characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> from the films. Several reviewers did praise the game's representation of the Predator, however, especially in the early levels.|$|E
5|$|Amy awakens to {{find herself}} {{strapped}} to an examining table, near to where Ambrose's husband Mo is also ensnared. Mo explains that the Silurians intended to vivisect her, as they have vivisected him— awake. The Doctor and Nasreen arrive underground in the TARDIS; the Doctor explains about the Silurians and says that he expects to encounter only a few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creatures.</b> The show ends on a cliffhanger as the Doctor and Nasreen behold an immense Silurian civilisation in the caverns below the earth.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Bruce Wayne {{falls down}} into a dry well and is {{attacked}} by a swarm of bats, subsequently developing a phobia <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creatures.</b> While watching an opera with his parents, Thomas and Martha, Bruce becomes frightened by performers masquerading as bats and asks to leave. Outside, mugger Joe Chill murders Bruce's parents in front of him. Orphaned, Bruce is raised by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth.|$|E

40|$|In Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, <b>the</b> <b>Creature</b> is {{introduced}} as a Romantic hero, with human emotions and needs and a grotesque appearance. <b>The</b> image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Creature</b> has since changed repeatedly through mass-media adaptations of Shelley’s novel. For example, the current standard image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Creature</b> bears a strong resemblance to Boris Karloff’s Creature (Frankenstein, 1931) in appearance and personality. This thesis examines {{the form and}} function of “the Creature” in contemporary cinematic adaptations of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818). By analysing the appearance, abilities and behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Creature</b> in <b>the</b> original Frankenstein (1818) and in cinematic adaptations from various genres, it is shown how <b>the</b> representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Creature</b> is influenced by internal and external genre cues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adaptation {{in which he is}} featured. The genres that are explored are the horror genre and the action genre, represented by the movies Frankenstein: Day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beast (2011) and I, Frankenstein (2014), respectively...|$|R

5|$|Expedition to the Barrier Peaks {{takes place}} on a {{spaceship}} in the Barrier Peaks mountain range of the World of Greyhawk campaign setting. In the adventure's introduction, it is explained that the Grand Duchy of Geoff is under constant attack by a succession of monsters that have been emerging from a cave in the mountains. The Grand Duke of Geoff has hired the characters to discover the origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creatures,</b> and stop their incursions.|$|E
5|$|More recently, giant spiders have {{featured}} in {{books such as}} the 1998 fantasy novel Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J. K. Rowling. This book was later followed by a motion picture of the same name, using the giant spider Aragog from the novel as a supporting character and pet of grounds keeper, Hagrid. In Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a book about many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> within the Harry Potter universe, these giant spiders are also known as Acromantulas.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an in-game clock and day-night system {{that affects the}} townsfolk and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> in the field (namely, the Minku - creatures from whom Musashi can obtain berries to increase his overall health stat), as well as forcing the player {{to pay attention to}} Musashi's fatigue rating that goes up over time with lack of sleep, which as the name implies will have a deteriorating effect on his combative ability.|$|E

25|$|Grant {{produced}} a sketch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> it was examined by zoologist Maurice Burton who stated it {{was consistent with}} the appearance and behaviour of an otter. Regarding <b>the</b> long size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> reported by Grant; {{it has been suggested that}} this was a faulty observation due to the poor light conditions. Palaeontologist Darren Naish has suggested that Grant may have seen either an otter or a seal and exaggerated his sighting over time.|$|R
5|$|While Roddenberry, Kelley and Nimoy {{gave their}} {{approval}} to the revised script, Paramount {{was concerned that}} the film would go over-budget as written and ordered cuts. Shatner's envisioned angels and demons at the film's climax were converted to rock monsters that the false god would animate from the earth. Shatner wanted six <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creatures,</b> but was forced to accept just one. Concerned that the franchise's momentum following The Voyage Home had disappeared, Paramount rushed the film into production in late 1988 despite the writers' strike cutting into pre-production.|$|E
5|$|An {{attempt to}} open a sealed chamber using a Borazon drill fails to make progress. However, a few moments after the drill is stopped, a small hole is seen, though the drill operator, Sladden (Duncan Lamont), is certain it was not created by his machine. The hole widens to reveal the corpses of three-legged, insectoid creatures with horned heads. Roney and Judd work to {{preserve}} the bodies before they decay. An examination of the creatures' physiology suggests {{they came from the}} planet Mars. Quatermass and Roney note the similarity between the appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> and images of the Devil.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Drakengard series, and follows the fifth ending of the first game, the events of which have left the planet Earth {{in a state of}} decay. Set over one thousand years after this, the game puts the player in control of the titular protagonist Nier, as he attempts to find a cure for an illness, known as the Black Scrawl, to which his daughter Yonah has succumbed. Partnering with a talking book known as Grimoire Weiss, he journeys with two other characters, Kainé and Emil, as he attempts to find a remedy and understand the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> known as Shades that stalk the world. The gameplay borrows elements from various video game genres, occasionally switching between them and the main role-playing-based gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{maternal}} care they receive, hatchlings commonly fall to predation. While the female is transporting some {{to the nursery}} area, others are picked off by predators that lurk near the nest. The hatchlings {{are a source of}} food for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> that feed on eggs, and are also subject to aquatic attacks by turtles, fish, and snakes. Birds of prey take their toll, and in any clutch there may be malformed individuals that are unlikely to survive. In northern Australia, the survival rate for saltwater crocodile hatchlings is only twenty-five percent, but with each succeeding year of life this improves, reaching sixty percent by year five. Mortality rates are fairly low among subadults and adults, though they are occasionally preyed on by large cats and snakes. The jaguar and the giant otter may prey on caimans in South America. In other parts of the world, elephants and hippopotamuses may kill crocodiles defensively. Authorities differ as to whether much cannibalism takes place among crocodilians. Adults do not normally eat their own offspring, but there is some evidence of subadults feeding on juveniles and of adults attacking subadults. In Nile crocodiles, rival males sometimes kill each other during the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|The {{captain had}} to record his survey in {{painstaking}} paperwork, and Darwin too kept a daily log {{as well as}} detailed notebooks of his finds and speculations, and a diary which became his journal. Darwin's notebooks show a complete professionalism that he had probably learnt at the University of Edinburgh when making natural history notes while exploring {{the shores of the}} Firth of Forth with his brother Erasmus in 1826 and studying marine invertebrates with Robert Edmund Grant for a few months in 1827. Darwin had also collected beetles at Cambridge, but he was a novice in all other areas of natural history. During the voyage Darwin investigated small invertebrates, while collecting specimens of other creatures for experts to examine and describe once the Beagle had returned to England. More than half of his carefully organised zoology notes deal with marine invertebrates, and the notes record closely reasoned interpretations of what he found about their complex internal anatomy while dissecting specimens under his microscope, and of little experiments on their response to stimulation. His onshore observations included intense, analytical comments on possible reasons for the behaviour, distribution, and relation to their environment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> he saw. He made good use of the ship's excellent library of books on natural history, but continually questioned their correctness.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{collecting}} enough Power Stars, the Comet Observatory regains {{the power}} to transform into a comet, and flies to {{the centre of the}} universe, where Bowser is holding Peach captive. Confronting Bowser, Mario learns that his plan is to rule the entire universe with Peach at his side, using a newly constructed sun of his own via the power of the Grand Stars. Mario manages to defeat Bowser and free Peach, but Bowser's sun collapses into itself, becoming a supermassive black hole that begins consuming everything nearby. All of Rosalina's Lumas jump into the black hole to destroy it, but sacrifice themselves in the process. The black hole collapses into a singularity and explodes in a supernova. Rosalina appears to Mario as a giantess, revealing that dying stars are later reborn as new stars. Mario awakens in the restored Mushroom Kingdom, full with all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> he had met in the galaxies, alongside Peach and Bowser, celebrating the new galaxy that has emerged in the skies.|$|E
