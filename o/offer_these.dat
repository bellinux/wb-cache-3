On that day, a number of electric trains, which picked up their power from the third rail, were unable to run because of snow and ice on the line. Tornado was to haul a Cathedrals Express lunchtime special service from Victoria; a number of booked passengers {{had been unable to}} get there due to the conditions, and so there were spare seats; the train's operators decided to <b>offer</b> <b>these</b> seats to commuters whose trains had been cancelled.

They were subsequently bred to have greater depth, breadth and strength, {{at the expense of}} the dryness, nerve, expression and gait qualities for which they had previously been selected. From 1908 to 1940, the average height of Ostfriesisches decreased 4cm while average weight increased from 630kg to 760kg. Other regions began to breed heavy warmbloods: Baden-Württemberg, Hesse, Bavaria, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, and Silesia. While they were founded on their own stock, horses from Oldenburg and Ostfriesland were sold there each year to help them realize their goals.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the language policy for Mandarin and Malay, Indian students are given {{a wider variety of}} Indian languages to choose from. For example, Indian students speaking Dravidian languages study Tamil as a Mother Tongue. However, schools with low numbers of Tamil students might not provide Tamil language classes. As a result, students from such schools will attend Tamil language classes at the Umar Pulavar Tamil Language Centre (UPTLC). On the other hand, Indian students who speak non-Dravidian languages can choose from Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Gujarati and Urdu. However, as with Tamil, only certain schools <b>offer</b> <b>these</b> non-Dravidian languages. Thus, students will attend their respective language classes at designated language centres, held by the Board for the Teaching and Testing of South Asian Languages (BTTSAL).|$|E

25|$|In November 1958, Eagle {{applied to}} the Air Transport Advisory Council (ATAC), the {{contemporary}} UK Government department in charge of air transport economic regulation, for permission to offer low fares on existing and planned scheduled routes to Cyprus, Gibraltar, Malta, Singapore, the Bahamas, the Caribbean as well as East and West Africa. For instance, Eagle's £19 proposed fare to Malta compared with BEA's £52.60 and its £199 Singapore fare compared with a £351 fare charged by BOAC. This marked the first occasion on which a private British airline sought approval to offer scheduled fares that undercut the equivalent published fares of the state-owned airlines by a substantial margin. Eagle's low fares were designed to increase the British market share on routes the state airlines had monopolised by stimulating demand. The airline argued that the British {{economy as a whole}} would benefit if it was granted permission to <b>offer</b> <b>these</b> fares, as a consequence of additional foreign exchange earnings accruing to the UK Exchequer that resulted from boosting Britain's share of total traffic. Loss-making BEA and BOAC lodged objections with ATAC against Eagle's low-fare proposals, which were upheld.|$|E

Moreover such projects often yield social benefits, providing a community focus." ...|$|E
500|$|Offerings of rice, sake, {{and other}} food are {{given at the}} shrine to appease and please these kitsune messengers, who are then {{expected}} to plead with Inari on the worshipper's behalf. [...] Inari-zushi, a Japanese sushi roll of packaged fried tofu, is another popular offering. [...] Fried tofu {{is believed to be}} a favorite food of Japanese foxes, and an Inari-zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears, thus reinforcing the association. [...] Priests do not normally <b>offer</b> <b>these</b> foods to the deity, but it is common for shops that line the approach to an Inari shrine to sell fried tofu for devotees to offer. [...] Fox statues are often offered to Inari shrines by worshippers, and on occasion a stuffed and mounted fox is presented to a temple. [...] At one time, some temples were home to live foxes that were venerated, but this is not current practice.|$|E
