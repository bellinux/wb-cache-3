40|$|AbstractHydrogen {{bonds are}} {{important}} in determining the structure and function of biomolecules. Of particular interest are hydrogen bonds to quinones, which {{play an important role}} in the bioenergetics of respiration and photosynthesis. In this work we investigated the hydrogen bonds to the two carbonyl <b>oxygens</b> of the semiquinone QA⋅− in the well-characterized reaction center from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides R- 26. We used electron paramagnetic resonance and electron nuclear double resonance techniques at 35 GHz at a temperature of 80 K. The goal of this study was to identify and assign sets of 1 H-ENDOR lines to protons hydrogen bonded to each of the two <b>oxygens.</b> This was accomplished by preferentially exchanging the hydrogen bond on one of the <b>oxygens</b> with deuterium while concomitantly monitoring the changes in the amplitudes of the 1 H-ENDOR lines. The preferential deuteration of one of the <b>oxygens</b> was made possible by the different 1 H→ 2 H exchange times of the protons bonded to the two <b>oxygens.</b> The assignment of the 1 H-ENDOR lines sets the stage for the determination of the geometries of the H-bonds by a detailed field selection ENDOR study to be presented in a future article...|$|R
5|$|Free <b>oxygen</b> gas {{was almost}} nonexistent in Earth's {{atmosphere}} before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved, probably about 3.5 billion years ago. Free <b>oxygen</b> {{first appeared in}} significant quantities during the Paleoproterozoic eon (between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago). For the first billion years, any free <b>oxygen</b> produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations. When such <b>oxygen</b> sinks became saturated, free <b>oxygen</b> began to outgas from the oceans 3–2.7billion years ago, reaching 10% of its present level around 1.7billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} <b>oxygen</b> binding sites. The binding of carbon {{monoxide}} {{at one of these}} sites increases the <b>oxygen</b> affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain <b>oxygen</b> that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the <b>oxygen</b> dissociation curve to the left. Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and <b>oxygen</b> during carbon monoxide poisoning, little <b>oxygen</b> will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E
5|$|Hyperbaric <b>oxygen</b> is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} of carbon monoxide poisoning, as it may hasten dissociation of CO from carboxyhemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase {{to a greater extent than}} normal <b>oxygen.</b> Hyperbaric <b>oxygen</b> at three times atmospheric pressure reduces the half life of carbon monoxide to 23 (~80/3 minutes) minutes, compared to 80 minutes for <b>oxygen</b> at regular atmospheric pressure. It may also enhance <b>oxygen</b> transport to the tissues by plasma, partially bypassing the normal transfer through hemoglobin. However, it is controversial whether hyperbaric <b>oxygen</b> actually offers any extra benefits over normal high flow <b>oxygen,</b> in terms of increased survival or improved long-term outcomes. There have been randomized controlled trials in which the two treatment options have been compared; of the six performed, four found hyperbaric <b>oxygen</b> improved outcome and two found no benefit for hyperbaric <b>oxygen.</b> Some of these trials have been criticized for apparent flaws in their implementation. A review of all the literature on carbon monoxide poisoning treatment concluded that the role of hyperbaric <b>oxygen</b> is unclear and the available evidence neither confirms nor denies a medically meaningful benefit. The authors suggested a large, well designed, externally audited, multicentre trial to compare normal <b>oxygen</b> with hyperbaric <b>oxygen.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to this metabolic diversity, prokaryotes also possess a range of isozymes– different enzymes that catalyze the same reaction. For example, in E. coli, {{there are two different}} types of ubiquinol oxidase using <b>oxygen</b> as an electron acceptor.
