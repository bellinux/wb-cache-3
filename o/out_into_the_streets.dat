25|$|According to a {{contemporary}} {{study by the}} Enlightenment-era chemist Lavoisier, Parisians spent about twice as much on meat as they did on bread, which accounted for only about thirteen percent of their food budget. Butcher shops all around the city provided the meat; the animals were slaughtered in the courtyards behind the shops, and the blood often flowed <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> The better cuts of meat went to aristocracy and the merchant class; poorer Parisians ate mutton and pork, sausages, andouilles, brains, tripe, salted pork, other inexpensive cuts. The uneaten meat from the tables of the upper class was carefully collected and sold by regrattiers who specialized in this trade.|$|E

2500|$|A {{gay pride}} parade through central Bucharest was also {{initially}} projected, but was later abandoned, with various newspapers stating that Romanian society {{was not ready}} for such an event. Ştefan Iancu, the organiser of the 2004 Diversity Festival, stated to Ziarul, on 3 May 2004, that, [...] "We {{wanted to do this}} , but we don't know if we would succeed in convincing gay people to come <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Evidently, they are too afraid of the repercussions (jobs lost, shocked parents, etc.)" [...] Nonetheless, the next year a gay pride parade was organised as part of GayFest 2005.|$|E

[...] "And everything he said with I agreed with you know, leave the National Health Service alone, get rid of Trident, stuff like that, so it doesn't matter to me who gets the Labour leadership, it really doesn't matter.

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Belle Époque, Paris was lit by a constellation of thousands of gaslights that were often admired by foreign visitors and helped give the city its nickname La Ville-Lumière: the [...] "City of Light". In 1870, there were 56,573 gaslights used exclusively to illuminate the streets of the city. The gas was produced by ten enormous factories {{around the edge of the}} city that were located near the circle of fortifications. It was distributed in pipes installed under the new boulevards and streets. The street lights were placed every twenty meters on the Grands Boulevards. At a predetermined minute after nightfall, a small army of 750 uniformed allumeurs ("lighters") carrying long poles with small lamps at the end went <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> to turn on a pipe of gas inside each lamppost and light the lamp. The entire city was illuminated within forty minutes. The Arc de Triomphe was crowned with a ring of gaslights, and the Champs-Élysées was lined with ribbons of white light.|$|E

Haussmann placed street lamps every twenty meters on the boulevards. At a predetermined minute after nightfall a small army of 750 allumeurs in uniform, carrying long poles with small lamps at the end, went <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> turned on a pipe of gas inside each lamppost, and lit the lamp. [...] The entire city was illuminated within forty minutes. The amount of light was greatly enhanced by the white stone walls of the Haussmann apartment buildings, which reflected the brilliant gaslight. Certain buildings and monuments were also illuminated; the Arc de Triomphe was crowned with a ring of gaslights, as was the outline of the Hôtel de Ville. The Champs-Elysees was lined with ribbons of white light. [...] The major theaters, cafés and department stores were also brightly lit with gaslight, as were some rooms in apartments in the new Haussmann buildings. The concert gardens in which balls were held in summer had gas lighting as well as small gas lamps in the gardens, where gentlemen could light their cigars and cigarettes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{alliance}} with the infante Miguel did not bear fruit. Influenced as always by his mother, Miguel led the April Revolt or Abrilada by the Lisbon military garrison on [...] The revolt started on the pretext of crushing the Freemasons and defending the king from threats of death that the Masons has supposedly made against him, but John {{was taken into custody}} at the Bemposta Palace, while several of Miguel's political enemies of Miguel's were also [...] imprisoned elsewhere. The infante's intent was to force his father to abdicate. Alerted to the situation, the diplomatic corps managed to enter Bemposta Palace. Those who held the king could not resist such authorities and restored a measure of freedom to the king. On 9 May, on the advice of friendly ambassadors, John pretended to travel to Caxias but, in fact, sought refuge with a British fleet anchored in the port. From aboard the ship HMS Windsor Castle, he sent reprimanded his son, deposed him from command of the army, and ordered him to release his political prisoners. Miguel was exiled. With the defeat of the rebellion, both liberals and absolutists came <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> to celebrate the survival of the legitimate government. On 14 May, the king returned to Bemposta, reconstituted the council of ministers and showed generosity to the others who had rebelled. Still, this did not dissuade the queen from further conspiracies. The police discovered another rebellion planned for 26 October, on the basis of which John placed his wife under house arrest in Queluz Palace.|$|E

2500|$|Employers, however, often fought back, and in {{the spring}} of 1938 a lengthy strike nearly ended in defeat for the union. [...] The U.S. economy had risen to its pre-depression levels by the spring of 1937, but a strong {{recession}} began in late summer (triggered in part by large reductions in federal spending, higher bank reserve requirements, and reductions in disposable income brought about by implementation of the Social Security Act). Between August 1937 and May 1938, industrial production fell by 30 percent, the economy contracted by more than 6 percent, and unemployment rose from 5 million to over 9 million. The steep recession led many employers to resist union demands. On February 11, 1938, employers locked out 4,000 fur workers as the IFWU contracts expired. Gold hesitated calling a strike for seven weeks, seeking peace with the manufacturers, but finally called all fur workers out in a general strike on March 30. Hoping for a quick end to the strike and alarmed by the lockout, Gold initially kept pickets and rallies small. But locked out workers attacked a fur dealer on April 1, and police retaliated against the pickets with clubs and beatings. Infuriated, Gold ordered all the union's members <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> The police responded by attempting to use violence to intimidate the strikers, and the union responded in kind. [...] For seven weeks, the fur district in New York City {{was in a state of}} near-riot. The union filed unfair labor practice charges against the employers, and the NLRB moved on May 6 to investigate. Mass picketing and mass rallies continued, and the employers asked Mayor LaGuardia and the police to end the strike. On May 13, the parties agreed to submit their disputes to Dr. Paul Abelson, an impartial arbitrator with the National Recovery Administration. Thirteen days later, Dr. Abelson announced a tentative agreement, and IFWU members ratified the contract on May 26. Although Gold publicly characterized the strike as a victory for the union, he privately conceded that the strike had been a very near thing.|$|E
