500|$|The writer Rupert Gould, in {{a lengthy}} essay on New South Greenland [...] {{published}} in 1929, queries {{the assumption that the}} [...] sighting was simply invented by Morrell, partly on the grounds that very little weight is given to the discovery in Morrell's 500-page account. Gould writes: [...] "If Morrell wished to gain an undeserved reputation as an Antarctic explorer, <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> he could have gone a better way about it than to bury his pièces justificatives, after he had forged them, in an undistinguished [...] corner of so bulky a book." [...] Nor would he have credited it to Captain Johnson two years earlier, rather than to himself.|$|E
500|$|A 2011 {{exhibit at}} the Chadwick School {{featured}} photos of the school by both Wright and Adams. Two of Wright's children had attended the school. A critic writing for the Los Angeles Times praised Wright's work: [...] "In the Chadwick exhibition, it's Wright who trumps Adams with the show's most jaw-dropping image: a 1947 shot of five boys playing basketball on the school's outdoor court, {{against a backdrop of}} rolling hills and the Los Angeles Basin far below. It captures a moment of sheer ballet, the composition so gracefully perfect that <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> it had been choreographed by Balanchine — except that you can't choreograph players leaping for a rebound." ...|$|E
500|$|In the November 1902 {{issue of}} the {{literary}} magazine The Bookman Herriman wrote of his profession self-deprecatingly, while poet La Touche Hancock, {{in an article in}} that issue titled [...] "The American Comic and Caricature Art", wrote, [...] "Art and poetry is the characteristic of George Herriman. [...] Were his drawings not so well known <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> he had mistaken his vocation." [...] Herriman's work was increasing in popularity, and he occasionally had front-page, full-color strips for the Pulitzer supplements, such as Two Jolly Jackies about two unemployed sailors, which began in January 1903. [...] He began drawing the cowboy strip Lariat Pete in September for the McClure syndicate after Two Jolly Jackies was ended.|$|E

2500|$|This {{terminology}} implies analysing {{the full}} infinitive as a two-word infinitive, which not all grammarians accept. As one who used [...] "infinitive" [...] {{to mean the}} single-word verb, Otto Jespersen challenged the epithet: [...] "'To' is no more {{an essential part of}} an infinitive than the definite article {{is an essential part of}} a nominative, and no <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of calling 'the good man' a split nominative." [...] However, no alternative terminology has been proposed.|$|E
2500|$|Size. An object {{can come}} in {{differently}} gender-marked versions, based on size. Masculine is big, getting smaller down through neuter and then feminine; neuter can sometimes be pejorative. Hence, camco [...] "big spoon" [...] and camcī [...] "small spoon", and vāṛko [...] "big bowl" [...] and vāṛkī [...] "small bowl". The same can apply to animates (animals) that fall under the second rule just above. <b>One</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> saslo to be [...] "male rabbit", but it's more so [...] "big rabbit".|$|E
2500|$|There can be [...] "refreshed" [...] shocks if {{the central}} engine {{continues}} to release fast-moving matter {{in small amounts}} even out to late times, these new shocks will {{catch up with the}} external shock to produce something like a late-time internal shock. This explanation has been invoked to explain the frequent flares seen in X-rays and at other wavelengths in many bursts, though some theorists are uncomfortable with the apparent demand that the progenitor (which <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> would be destroyed by the GRB) continues to remain active for very long.|$|E

2500|$|The Christian missionaries {{who began}} {{arriving}} in the late 19th century influenced the islanders' notions of modesty. In 1919, a visitor reported that Marshall Islands women [...] "are perfect models of prudery. Not <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of exposing her ankles." [...] Women in the Marshall Islands today are still very modest. They believe that a woman's thighs and shoulders should be covered. Women generally wear cotton muumuus or similar clothing that covers most of the body. Personal health is never discussed except within the family, and women are especially private about female-related health issues, although {{they are willing to}} talk about their breasts.|$|E
2500|$|No <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of saying, for example, [...] "Having a hand is {{just being}} {{disposed}} to certain sorts of behavior such as grasping" [...] (manual behaviorism), or [...] "Hands {{can be defined}} entirely {{in terms of their}} causes and effects" [...] (manual functionalism), or [...] "For a system to have a hand is just for it to be in a certain computer state with the right sorts of inputs and outputs" [...] (manual Turing machine functionalism), or [...] "Saying that a system has hands is just adopting a certain stance toward it" [...] (the manual stance).

2500|$|As an example, at {{the surface}} plasmon {{resonance}} for a silver nanoparticle, the scattering cross-section is about 10x the cross-section of the nanoparticle. [...] The goal of the nano-particles is to trap light {{on the surface of}} the SC. [...] The absorption of light is not important for the nanoparticle, rather, it is important for the SC. [...] <b>One</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> that if the nanoparticle is increased in size, then the scattering cross-section becomes larger. [...] This is true, however, when compared with the size of the nanoparticle, the ratio (...) is reduced. [...] Particles with a large scattering cross section tend to have a broader plasmon resonance range.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas Clerk, in his 1812 The Works of William Hogarth, {{writes that}} the sign-painter has been {{suggested}} as a satire on Jean-Étienne Liotard (called John Stephen by Clerk), a Swiss portrait painter and enameller whom Horace Walpole praised for his attention to detail and realism, mentioning he was, [...] "...devoid of imagination, and <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> memory, he could render nothing but what he saw before his eyes." [...] In his notes in Walpole's Anecdotes of painting in England, James Dallaway adds a footnote to this statement about Liotard claiming, [...] "Hogarth has introduced him, in several instances, alluding to this want of genius." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cobbett, Hazlitt observes, is so {{powerful}} a verbal combatant that <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> him unopposable, that [...] "not only no individual, but no corrupt system could hold out against his powerful and repeated attacks." [...] If he does not in practice succeed {{as well as one}} would expect, it is that he undermines his position by a number of self-defeating faults. These include a maddening inconsistency, as well as an unwillingess to compromise or collaborate with others. In fact, he antagonizes his would-be supporters along with his opponents: [...] "with the same weapon" [...] he uses against his enemies, he also [...] "lays his friends low, and puts his own party hors de combat." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1750, James Birket, {{traveling}} toward New York, {{wrote that}} the stretch between Greenwich and Stamford was a [...] "Most Intollerable bad road" [...] (his spelling). In 1786, another traveler, Englishman Robert Hunter Jr., made note of the [...] "steep precipice that General Putnam galloped down when he {{was surprised by the}} enemy. <b>One</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> to look at it, it must be a certain death. -- The road is made to wind around this precipice so as to avoid (it) entirely. You have an elegant view of the country from the summit of it." [...] In areas where farmers had cut down trees, the views from Connecticut hills were likely much more noticeable than today.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the modern}} world, a [...] "Cloud Cuckoo Lander" [...] {{is defined as}} someone who is seen as [...] "crazy" [...] or [...] "strange" [...] by most average people, often doing or saying things that {{seemingly}} only make sense to themselves, but also exhibit cleverness at times in ways no <b>one</b> else <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{theory that}} {{explains}} the rationale for odd pricing is prospect theory. This theory says that [...] "consumers facing uncertainty in decision making, base {{the value of an}} alternative on gains or losses offered by the alternative, relative to some reference point, rather than on final absolute states of wealth or welfare". This theory is {{based on the fact that}} losses mean more than gains. So based on that criterion, <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> that something only a few cents under a whole dollar would actually be beneficial to the price. This theory works so well because of how the [...] "reference price" [...] is established by the consumer. The reference price for something that is $19.98 would be $20. This establishes the odd pricing as a better deal.|$|E
2500|$|Is {{it seriously}} contemplated, may I ask, to repress these aspirations, {{to hold this}} aggrieved and angry {{multitude}} down by force? Because – let us make no mistake - it will come {{to that in the}} end. This is not a mere denial of liberty; it is a case of taking away liberty which has been long enjoyed. That process, however disguised, is an act of spoliation dependent on force but force is not solvent of human problems. <b>One</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> that in South Africa there would be no need to press home that truth. And yet we are apt to forget, in dealing with this problem, that you cannot kill the soul of the people; and that the spirit of man will not tamely submit to the loss of rights which materially and spiritually he values. ...|$|E
2500|$|Chris Carle of IGN said: [...] "One Tree Hill, like The O.C. {{is helping}} to infuse network {{television}} with a much-needed renaissance of teen drama. The series is a bit less fun and more dramatic than Fox's, and the themes and storylines hold a little more gravity than The O.C.'s sometimes soap opera dynamic, but it's a solid show." [...] Keith Helinski of Moviefreak.com disagreed with The O.C. comparisons, stating, [...] "Ever so often I hear people refer to the show as The WB's version of The O.C., but I disagree. Summerland is more like The O.C. with similar scenarios and settings, while One Tree Hill is more suited as a Dawson's Creek knock off." [...] He added, [...] "In fact, story lines, characters, and even the themes are so similar that <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> One Tree Hill is like Dawson's Creek: The Next Generation." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album 4 stars, stating: [...] "Although best-known as an altoist and a tenor-saxophonist, Nelson sticks {{exclusively}} to soprano throughout the set.

Although <b>one</b> <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> of Nelson as a soprano stylist, his strong playing actually put him {{near the top of}} his field".|$|R
2500|$|As the {{district}} court noted, we have repeatedly rejected {{the claim that the}} Sixteenth Amendment was improperly ratified. <b>One</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> this repeated rejection of Benson's Sixteenth Amendment argument would put the matter to rest Benson is the co-author of The Law That Never Was, a book that purports to [...] "review the documents concerning the states' ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment" [...] and to show [...] "that only four states ratified the Sixteenth Amendment [...] the official promulgation of the amendment by Secretary of State Knox in 1913 is therefore void." [...] Benson insists that as the co-author of The Law That Never Was, and the man who actually reviewed the state documents [...] "proving" [...] improper ratification, he is uniquely qualified to make the [...] "exceptionally strong showing" [...] we spoke of in Foster. Because of this, Benson insists, {{the district}} court should have at least granted him an evidentiary hearing on the Sixteenth Amendment issue.|$|E
2500|$|... was {{the natural}} {{expression}} {{of the character of}} the present Government. There was hardly any increase allowed for the services which went to build up the life of the people, education and health. Everything was devoted to piling up the instruments of death. The Chancellor expressed great regret that he should have to spend so much on armaments, but said that it was absolutely necessary and was due only to the actions of other nations. <b>One</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> to listen to him that the Government had no responsibility for the state of world affairs....The Government has now resolved to enter upon an arms race, and the people will have to pay for their mistake in believing that it could be trusted to carry out a policy of peace.... This is a War Budget. We can look in the future for no advance in Social Legislation. All available resources are to be devoted to armaments." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 16th century, Lê Anh Tông of the Lê Dynasty {{encouraged}} traders {{to visit}} Vietnam by opening up Thăng Long (Hanoi), Huế and Hội An. Chinese {{presence in the}} Huế/Hội An area dated back as early as 1444, when a monk from Fujian built the Buddhist temple, Chua Chuc Thanh. Hội An quickly developed into a trading port from the 16th century onwards, when Chinese and Japanese traders began to arrive in the city in greater numbers. When an Italian Jesuit priest, Father Christofo Borri, visited the city in 1618, he aptly described the city as: [...] "The city of Faifo is so vast that <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> it is two juxtaposed cities; a Chinese city and a Japanese city." [...] The Japanese traders quickly disappeared by {{the first half of}} the 17th century as Tokugawa shogunate imposed a policy of self-isolation, and when Dutch traders such as Francisco Groemon [...] visited Hội An in 1642, the Japanese population was no more than 50 people, while the Chinese numbered some 5,000 individuals.|$|E
