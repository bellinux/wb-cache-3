5|$|CT scans, chest X-rays {{and other}} forms of imaging can help {{evaluate}} the heart's size, evaluate for signs of pulmonary <b>oedema,</b> and indicate whether there is fluid around the heart. They are also useful for evaluating the aorta, the major blood vessel which leaves the heart.|$|E
5|$|Between 1980 and 2000, {{there have}} been four {{recorded}} deaths, all in Tasmania and all due to anaphylactic shock. All known patients who died from jack jumper stings were at least 40 {{years old and had}} cardiopulmonary comorbidities. Severe laryngeal <b>oedema</b> and coronary atherosclerosis was detected in most of the autopsies of those who died. Most of the victims died within 20 minutes after being stung. Prior to any desensitisation program being established, the fatality rate was one person every four years from the sting.|$|E
5|$|In a fatal attack, however, it manifests very quickly. In {{a number}} of cases, death has {{occurred}} within 24 hours of {{the onset of the}} infection, while other cases do not last longer than around five days. The virus attacks endothelial cells, rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; once this reaches the heart, the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock. Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat, a rapid heartbeat, and decreased blood-cell count, as well as cyanosis of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and <b>oedema</b> of the head and trunk.|$|E
5|$|In vivo {{studies in}} {{mice and rats}} showed that a topically {{administered}} SEGRAM inhibited peroxidase activity and formation of <b>oedema,</b> both indicators of anti-inflammatory activity, comparably to prednisolone. Systemic administration in mice or rats indicate that SEGRAMs can diminish acute infections, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and colitis. In vivo evidence on whether particular SEGRAMs can elicit similar effects than classic glucocorticoid in cancer pathologies is currently lacking.|$|E
5|$|King died {{unexpectedly}} of cerebral <b>oedema</b> on 28November, aged 47. Survived by {{his wife}} and children, he was cremated at Fawkner Crematorium, Melbourne. His funeral service at South Yarra was attended by hundreds of mourners from the military and civil aviation world, including the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, and {{a representative of the}} Minister for Air; the pallbearers included Air Vice Marshal Henry Wrigley, Air Commodore Raymond Brownell, Group Captain Allan Walters, and Wing Commander Henry Winneke.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{has several}} serious complications. Among {{these is the}} {{development}} of respiratory distress, which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe P.falciparum malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis, noncardiogenic pulmonary <b>oedema,</b> concomitant pneumonia, and severe anaemia. Although rare in young children with severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women. Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality. Renal failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.|$|E
5|$|Stein's {{body was}} {{returned}} to Glasgow, where his funeral took place on 13 September 1985. In later years {{it was revealed that}} it was not a heart attack, but rather pulmonary <b>oedema</b> (fluid in the lungs) as a result of heart disease that caused Stein's death. Stein had stopped taking the diuretic medication prescribed for this in the days leading up to the game, which has been suggested as a contributory factor to his eventual collapse.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal <b>oedema</b> and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm {{has been reported}}. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of {{the skin of the}} hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).|$|E
5|$|The crocodilian {{has perhaps}} the most complex {{vertebrate}} circulatory system. It has a four-chambered heart and two ventricles, an unusual trait among extant reptiles, and both a left and right aorta which are connected by a hole called the Foramen of Panizza. Like birds and mammals, crocodilians have heart valves that direct blood flow in a single direction through the heart chambers. They also have unique cog-teeth-like valves that, when interlocked, direct blood to the left aorta {{and away from the}} lungs, and then back around the body. This system may allow the animals to remain submerged for a longer period, but this explanation has been questioned. Other possible reasons for the peculiar circulatory system include assistance with thermoregulatory needs, prevention of pulmonary <b>oedema,</b> or faster recovery from metabolic acidosis. Retaining carbon dioxide within the body permits an increase in the rate of gastric acid secretion and thus the efficiency of digestion, and other gastrointestinal organs such as the pancreas, spleen, small intestine, and liver also function more efficiently.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hepatic encephalopathy is a clinical one, once other causes for confusion or coma have been excluded; no test fully diagnoses or excludes it. Serum ammonia levels are elevated in 90% of people, {{but not all}} hyperammonaemia (high ammonia levels) is associated with encephalopathy. A CT scan of the brain usually shows no abnormality except in stage IV encephalopathy, when cerebral <b>oedema</b> may be visible. Other neuroimaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are not currently regarded as useful, although they may show abnormalities. Electroencephalography shows no clear abnormalities in stage 0, even if minimal HE is present; in stages I, II and III there are triphasic waves over the frontal lobes that oscillate at 5Hz, and in stage IV there is slow delta wave activity. However, the changes in EEG are not typical enough to be useful in distinguishing hepatic encephalopathy from other conditions.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{causes of}} deaths were choking, reflexogenic circulatory {{collapse}} and pulmonary <b>oedema.</b> Findings during autopsies revealed changes {{not only in}} the lungs but also cerebral <b>oedema,</b> tubular necrosis of the kidneys, fatty degeneration of the liver and necrotising enteritis. The stillbirth rate increased by up to 300% and neonatal mortality rate by around 200%.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes diffuse {{inflammation}} {{results in}} complete loss of villi, involvement of multiple layers, submucosal <b>oedema</b> and fibrosis.|$|E
25|$|There {{is almost}} {{invariably}} a secondary uveitis present with corneal ulceration, {{and signs of}} this may also be seen: miosis, corneal <b>oedema,</b> aqueous flare, hypopyon, IOP changes.|$|E
25|$|First {{trimester}} ultrasound of noonan syndrome reveals nuchal <b>oedema</b> / cystic hygroma almost same {{as seen in}} Turner syndrome. Follow up scans may shows {{clinical features}} that already described above.|$|E
25|$|Its major dose-limiting toxicities are {{corticosteroid}} in nature, {{because of}} the inhibitory effect that its chief active constituents, glycyrrhizin and enoxolone, have on cortisol degradation, and include <b>oedema,</b> hypokalaemia, weight gain or loss, and hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Larvae and nymphs, as well {{as adults}} are capable of causing very {{dramatic}} allergic reactions. Dramatic local redness (erythema) and fluid swelling (<b>oedema)</b> may develop within 2–3 hours of attachment of even one larva.|$|E
25|$|Attachment {{of a few}} larvae to a non-sensitised host provokes {{little or}} no response, even though the contact is {{prolonged}} over several days. However, {{towards the end of}} feeding some pruritus, erythema and localised <b>oedema</b> may develop at the site of attachment.|$|E
25|$|People with high-altitude {{sickness}} {{generally have}} reduced hyperventilator response, impaired gas exchange, fluid retention or increased sympathetic drive. There {{is thought to}} be an increase in cerebral venous volume due to increase in cerebral blood flow and hypocapnic cerebral vasoconstriction causing <b>oedema.</b>|$|E
25|$|Eight {{more deaths}} were {{confirmed}} on 9 August 2009. Among the eight patient who died, three died on 3 August, two on 5 August, four on 7 August {{and one on}} 8 August. All {{of them were in}} the high-risk group except a 20-year-old college student who was found dead at her hostel about a week after obtaining outpatient treatment. Among the dead were two Sabahans, {{one of them was a}} 24-year-old obese woman from Ranau who died of pulmonary <b>oedema</b> after a bout of flu while the other one was a 74-year-old man who had a history of heart problem who died of pneumonia and pulmonary <b>oedema.</b> The other deaths were a 47-year-old patient with asthma in Sarawak and a 37-year-old obese man who died of broncho-pneumonia at the hospital in Johor Bahru.|$|E
25|$|Aspirated {{water that}} reaches the alveoli destroys the surfactant, which causes {{pulmonary}} <b>oedema</b> and decreased lung compliance which compromises oxygenation in affected {{parts of the}} lungs. This is associated with metabolic acidosis, and secondary fluid and electrolyte shifts. During alveolar fluid exchange, diatoms present in the water may pass through the alveolar wall into the capillaries to be carried to internal organs. Presence of these diatoms may be diagnostic of drowning.|$|E
25|$|It was {{announced}} that on 11 September, {{the death of the}} 19-year-old man brought the total number of death cases to 74. The patient was brought to Gerik Hospital after flu symptoms persisted for 4 days. On 20 August, he was transferred to Ipoh Hospital where he was administered Tamiflu. Despite given antiviral drugs, he died on 23 August due to Acute Pulmonary <b>Oedema</b> with Underlying Influenza A(H1N1) infection.|$|E
25|$|After {{the tick}} is removed {{pruritus}} may recur {{at the site}} of attachment at intervals over some weeks, and a small firm lump usually forms within a day or so of the tick's removal. This again may persist for many weeks. There may be some discoloration of the area of the bite. In other cases the skin reactions may be severe with marked pruritus and considerable erythema, <b>oedema</b> and induration. People also report headaches.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{fracture}} and dislocation, occlusion of blood vessels becomes the major cause of death, rather than asphyxiation. Obstruction of venous drainage of the brain via occlusion of the internal jugular veins leads to cerebral <b>oedema</b> and then cerebral ischemia. The face will typically become engorged and cyanotic (turned blue through lack of oxygen). There will be the classic sign of strangulation, petechiae, little blood marks on the face and in the eyes from burst blood capillaries. The tongue may protrude.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (≥1% of patients) {{associated with}} systemic aciclovir therapy (oral or IV) include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, encephalopathy (with IV use only), injection site reactions (with IV use only) and headache. In high doses, hallucinations have been reported. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include agitation, vertigo, confusion, dizziness, <b>oedema,</b> arthralgia, sore throat, constipation, abdominal pain, hair loss, rash and weakness. Rare adverse effects (<0.1% of patients) include coma, seizures, neutropenia, leukopenia, crystalluria, anorexia, fatigue, hepatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, {{thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura}} and anaphylaxis.|$|E
25|$|Buckland's {{early death}} was presaged by lung haemorrhages in 1879 after {{working in the}} winter. In 1880 he had severe <b>oedema.</b> The excess fluid was drained using a novel {{treatment}} of the time, a cannula called Southey's tube developed by the surgeon Dr Henry Herbert Southey whose brother, the poet Robert Southey, {{was a friend of}} Buckland. He also had asthma and bronchitis from a history of heavy cigar smoking. The death certificate records the cause as hepatic disease and bronchitis although the cause may have been pulmonary tuberculosis. He was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in intake of licorice can cause many toxic effects. Hyper mineralocorticosteroid syndrome can {{occur when the}} body retains sodium, loses potassium altering biochemical and hormonal activities. Some of these activities include lower aldosterone level, decline of the renin-angiotensin system and increased levels of the atrial natriuretic hormone in order to compensate the variations in homoeostasis. Some other symptoms of toxicity include electrolyte imbalance, <b>oedema,</b> increased blood pressure, weight gain, heart problems, and weakness. Individuals will experience certain symptoms based on the severity of toxicity. Some other complaints include fatigue, shortness of breath, renal failure, and paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Pre-treatment with {{corticosteroids}} {{has been}} used to decrease hypersensitivity reactions and <b>oedema</b> in response to docetaxel and has shown no effect on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. The efficacy of docetaxel was improved by treatment with oral capecitabine, and after more than 27 months follow-up the survival benefit has been confirmed. Doxorubicin was combined with docetaxel in one study of 24 patients and resulted in an increased AUC of docetaxel by 50 to 70%, indicating doxorubicin may affect the disposition of docetaxel. Etoposide has also been shown to decrease docetaxel clearance, though patient numbers for this observation have been low.|$|E
25|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} in itself painless. Many low-dose palliative {{treatments}} (for example, radiation therapy to bony metastases) cause minimal or no side effects, although short-term pain flare-up can be experienced {{in the days following}} treatment due to <b>oedema</b> compressing nerves in the treated area. Higher doses can cause varying side effects during treatment (acute side effects), in the months or years following treatment (long-term side effects), or after re-treatment (cumulative side effects). The nature, severity, and longevity of side effects depends on the organs that receive the radiation, the treatment itself (type of radiation, dose, fractionation, concurrent chemotherapy), and the patient.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{effect of}} the food crisis on German health and {{mortality}} has {{been a matter of}} some contention. Speaking of the Anglo-American zones, Herbert Hoover reported that in the fall of 1946, starvation produced a 40 percent increase in mortality among Germans over 70. However, John Farquharson cites statistics indicating that the incidence of hunger <b>oedema</b> was low in 1946–1947. According to the British Medical Journal, mortality in the British zone was above its pre-war level until June, 1946, when the death rate fell below that of 1938. Also, once it became clear there would be no rising, as threatened by the Nazis during the war, food controls were relaxed.|$|E
25|$|Attempts to {{actively}} expel {{water from the}} airway by abdominal thrusts or positioning head downwards should be avoided as they delay the start of ventilation and {{increase the risk of}} vomiting, with a significantly increased risk of death, as aspiration of stomach contents is a common complication of resuscitation efforts. Administration of oxygen at 15 litres per minute by face mask or bag mask is often sufficient, but tracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Suctioning of pulmonary <b>oedema</b> fluid should be balanced against the need for oxygenisation. The target of ventilation is to achieve 92% to 96% arterial saturation and adequate chest rise. Positive end-expiratory pressure will generally improve oxygenation.|$|E
25|$|Ischaemia/infarction: if an {{arterial}} thrombus {{cannot be}} lysed {{by the body}} {{and it does not}} embolise, and if the thrombus is large enough to impair or occlude blood flow in the involved artery, then local ischaemia or infarction will result. A venous thrombus {{may or may not be}} ischaemic, since veins distribute deoxygenated blood that is less vital for cellular metabolism. Nevertheless, non-ischaemic venous thrombosis may still be problematic, due to the swelling caused by blockage to venous drainage. In deep vein thrombosis this manifests as pain, redness, and swelling; in retinal vein occlusion this may result in macular <b>oedema</b> and visual acuity impairment, which if severe enough can lead to blindness.|$|E
25|$|Drowning {{would be}} {{considered}} as a possible cause of death when the body was recovered from a body of water, or in close proximity to a fluid which could plausibly have caused drowning, or when found with the head immersed in a fluid. A medical diagnosis of death by drowning is generally made after other possible causes of death have been excluded by means of a complete autopsy and toxicology tests. Indications of drowning are seldom completely unambiguous, and may include bloody froth in the airway, water in the stomach, cerebral <b>oedema</b> and petrous or mastoid haemorrhage. Some evidence of immersion may be unrelated to the cause of death, and lacerations and abrasions may have occurred before or after immersion or death.|$|E
25|$|Administration {{of oxygen}} at 15 litres per minute by face mask or bag valve mask is often sufficient, but {{tracheal}} intubation with mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Suctioning of pulmonary <b>oedema</b> fluid should be balanced against {{the need for}} oxygenation. The target of ventilation is to achieve 92% to 96% arterial saturation and adequate chest rise. Positive end-expiratory pressure will generally improve oxygenation. Drug administration via peripheral veins is preferred over endotracheal administration. Hypotension remaining after oxygenation may be treated by rapid crystalloid infusion. Cardiac arrest in drowning usually presents as asystole or pulseless electrical activity. Ventricular fibrillation {{is more likely to}} be associated with complications of pre-existing coronary artery disease, severe hypothermia, or the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine.|$|E
25|$|Repeated {{infestation}} {{with the}} larva, as occurs in rural and wooded suburban areas where bandicoots are common, rapidly {{leads to the}} development of hypersensitivity. Dramatic local erythema, hypoesthesia and <b>oedema</b> and pruritus may develop within 2–3 hours of attachment of even one larva if a person has been sensitised by a previous bite. In this case attachment of the larvae leads to formation of intra-epidermal blebs and eventually vesicles. These eventually rupture and the larvae detach and are lost. Frequently, a tick embedded over an eyelid will result in gross facial and neck swelling within a few hours. The person can go on to develop very severe signs of tracheopharyngeal compression within 5–6 hours after the first onset of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, it was Lady Caroline who prevailed on {{her husband}} {{to agree to a}} formal {{separation}} in 1825. Both parties had had numerous extramarital affairs by that time and Lamb had long been known to eschew duplicity. She took up permanent residence at Brocket Hall. Her struggle with mental instability became more pronounced in her last years, complicated by her abuse of alcohol and laudanum. By 1827, she was under the care of a full-time physician as her body, which had always been frail, began to shut down and she retained fluids (a condition then known as dropsy, and now known as <b>oedema).</b> William Lamb was Chief Secretary for Ireland by that time and made a perilous crossing to be by her side when Lady Caroline died on 25 January 1828.|$|E
25|$|Sheep may be {{infected}} by four recognized species of Sarcocystis: S. arieticanis and S. tenella (S. ovicanis) are pathogenic; S. gigantea (S. ovifelis) and S. medusiformis are non-pathogenic. Infection with these parasites {{is common in}} the US with over 80% of sheep examined showing evidence of infection. S. arieticanis and S. tenella both produce extra intestinal disease. Anemia, anorexia, ataxia, and abortions are the chief clinical signs. Myositis with flaccid paralysis has been reported {{as a consequence of}} infection. Ovine protozoan myeloencephalitis is a recognised syndrome that may occur in outbreaks. The usual pathological findings in such cases are multifocal spinal cord white matter <b>oedema</b> and necrosis, glial nodules and mild to moderate nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis. The diagnosis may be established finding protozoan bodies (12.7-23.0 micrometres) that stain immunocytochemically for Sarcocystis epitopes.|$|E
