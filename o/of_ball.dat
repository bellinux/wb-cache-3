5|$|His father {{encouraged}} him to play sport and he showed promise in a variety <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> sports, particularly cricket, rugby and tennis. Aged 12, he gained a place as a slow bowler for Newcastle Boys' High School's cricket team. On Saturday afternoons he played for Blackwall, a team in the local C-grade competition. Morris attended Canterbury Boys' High School from 1936 to 1939 where he represented the school at cricket and rugby union, and was appointed school captain (head boy) in Year 11.|$|E

50|$|The most {{intuitive}} answer {{seems to}} be that the vase contains an infinite number <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> by noon, since at every step along the way more balls are being added than removed. By definition, at each step, there will be a greater number <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> than at the previous step. There is no step, in fact, where the number <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> is decreased from the previous step. If the number <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> increases each time, then after infinite steps there will be an infinite number <b>of</b> <b>balls.</b>|$|R
40|$|The nonrepetitive runout (NRRO) {{value of}} {{retainer}} revolution is caused mainly by the diameter differences <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> mounted in a bearing. Additionally, {{when more than}} one ball has diameter difference, the NRRO value of retainer revolution is believed to vary with the location <b>of</b> <b>balls.</b> In this study, the authors theoretically analyzed the NRRO value of retainer revolution considering the diameter differences and location <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> mounted in a bearing. Consequently, it is clarified that the mean value of the retainer revolution component calculated in all locations <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> decreased with increasing number <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> in a rolling bearing...|$|R
30|$|Figures  8, 9 and 10 {{show the}} effect of {{different}} parameters on response in contour plot for the − 0.7  +  1  mm size fraction. Figure  8 shows that decrease in amount of feed and increase in grinding time more fine material can be produced. This {{may be due to}} more impact <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> will be observed by the feed which results in more fine material. Figure  9 shows that number <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> used in grinding plays an important role. Increasing number <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> can produce finer particles. On the other hand if the fineness is fixed one can reduce the grinding time and energy can be saved. Figure  10 shows the effect <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> and grinding time on d 80. It is clear from figure that number <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> on fineness has dominant effect than grinding time. With more number <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> and less grinding time one can produce more fine powder. The figure reflects that process will be inefficient if ball mill is operated between 11 and 16 number <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> and 4 to 5.9  min grinding time.|$|R
5|$|An {{official}} groundbreaking at {{the school}} was held on September 23, 2005, with school board members Nancy Petsuch, Greg Marvel, and San Ramon Mayor H. Abram Wilson in attendance. The construction of the school was divided into two phases. The first phase, which involved site grading, utilities, and paving, commenced in May 2005 and was completed by January 2006; the second phase, which involved constructing buildings, landscaping and creation <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> fields, commenced in February 2006 and was completed by August 2007. In a December 2006 meeting, the City Council of the City of San Ramon approved {{the construction of a}} performing arts center and aquatics center for joint-use between the city and the SRVUSD. Total construction took 16 months, five months less than predicted.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{defensive}} injury crisis at the club, Carrick started the 2012–13 season as a makeshift centre-back. His inexperience in the role was exploited by Everton in the season opener, as Marouane Fellaini beat him to a corner kick to score the only goal of the game. He continued in the role for the next match against Fulham. He scored his first goal of the season in a 1–0 Champions League victory against Galatasaray, after series <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> movement leading to Michael Carrick rounding the goalkeeper to score with his left foot. On 24 November 2012, Carrick was left out the squad that defeated QPR 3–1, ending his run of 33 consecutive league starts.|$|E
5|$|Bevan {{suggested}} a political deception {{with the aim}} of convincing the Swedish government that the Allies intended to invade Norway. During the war Sweden maintained a neutral position, and had relations with both Axis and the Allied nations. It was therefore assumed that if Sweden believed in an imminent threat to Norway this would be passed on to German intelligence. Graffham was envisioned as an extension of existing pressure the Allies were placing on Sweden to end their neutral stance, one example being the requests to end the export <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> bearings (an important component in military hardware) to Germany. By increasing this pressure with additional, false requests, Bevan hoped to further convince the Germans that Sweden was preparing to join the Allied nations.|$|E

5|$|Stoke City {{went into}} their first FA Cup Final as underdogs {{according}} to their manager Tony Pulis, while Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini saw in-form Stoke's underdog tag as a risk for complacency from his side. There were fitness doubts over key players for both teams, Carlos Tevez for Manchester City, and Matthew Etherington for Stoke City, who suffered a hamstring tear only 17 days prior to the final, but both were able to start the match. However, Stoke City's underdog tag proved true as Mancini's Manchester City side had the better of the match, with a 59percent share <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> possession and 23 attempts on goal to Stoke City's nine, only {{one of which was}} on target.|$|E
5|$|The semi-final, against Everton, {{was played}} at Villa Park. Everton were renowned for their {{powerful}} midfield <b>of</b> <b>Ball,</b> Harvey and Kendall, but opted to play more defensively than usual. Manchester City nevertheless paid {{special attention to}} this area, and instructed David Connor to man-mark Ball. Mike Doyle suffered an injury in the first half, and spent 20 minutes off the field. City had the better of the game, but goalscoring chances were missed by Lee and Young. With little time remaining, Young forced a corner. Young took the corner himself, from which teenager Tommy Booth scored the game's only goal.|$|E
5|$|The ships' main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} four smoothbore, muzzle-loading 11-inch Dahlgren guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets. The fore turret in each ship, except , {{was designed by}} Eads while the aft turret was the standard Ericsson design used in most Union monitors. Unlike the latter, which rested its entire weight on a central spindle {{that had to be}} elevated in order for the turret to rotate, Eads' design better distributed its weight because it rested on a number <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> bearings underneath {{the outer edge of the}} turret. The structure of the Eads turret extended down to be bottom of the ship and the entire structure rotated. The guns in the Eads turret were mounted on a steam-powered platform that moved up and down, so that the guns could be reloaded below deck, safe from enemy interference.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} N interacting two-colour Friedman urns. The interaction model considered is such that the reinforcement of each urn depends on the fraction <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> a particular colour in that urn {{as well as the}} overall fraction <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> that colour in all the urns combined together. We show that the urns synchronize almost surely and that the fraction <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> each colour converges to the deterministic limit of one-half, which matches with the limit known for a single Friedman urn. Furthermore, we use the notion of stable convergence to obtain limit theorems for fluctuations around the synchronization limit...|$|R

5|$|Memorials to Ball in {{his native}} Nottingham include a {{monument}} and statue in the grounds of Nottingham Castle. The monument, which was commissioned by the city council and funded by public subscription, consists of a bronze group on a carved pedestal of Portland stone and granite. The bronze group, by the sculptor Henry Poole, shows a life-size figure <b>of</b> <b>Ball</b> with an allegorical female figure at his shoulder. The monument was unveiled on 8 September 1921 by Air Marshal Trenchard, with military honours including a flypast by a squadron of RAF aircraft. In 1929 the bronze model for Ball's statue was presented by his father to the National Portrait Gallery in London, where it is on display. In further remembrance of his son, Albert Ball, Sr. commissioned {{the building of the}} Albert Ball Memorial Homes in Lenton to house the families of local servicemen killed in action. The Lenton War Memorial, located in front of the homes, includes Ball's name and was also paid for by the Ball family. The homes were Grade-II listed for historic preservation in 1995.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{in this paper}} an urn and ball problem with replacement, where balls are with different colors and are drawn uniformly from a unique urn. The numbers <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> with a given color are i. i. d. random variables with a heavy tailed probability distribution, for instance a Pareto or a Weibull distribution. We draw a small fraction p ≪ 1 {{of the total number}} <b>of</b> <b>balls.</b> The basic problem addressed in this paper is to know to which extent we can infer the total number of colors and the distribution of the number <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> with a given color. By means of Le Cam’s inequality and Chen-Stein method, bounds for the total variation norm between the distribution of the number <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> drawn with a given color and the Poisson distribution with the same mean are obtained. We then show that the distribution of the number <b>of</b> <b>balls</b> drawn with a given color has the same tail as that of the original number <b>of</b> <b>balls.</b> We finally establish explicit bounds between the two distributions when each ball is drawn with fixed probability p. 1...|$|R
