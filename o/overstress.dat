500|$|Another {{class of}} {{inherent}} errors {{is that of}} position error. [...] A position error is produced by the aircraft's static pressure being different from the air pressure remote from the aircraft. [...] This error {{is caused by the}} air flowing past the static port at a speed different from the aircraft's true airspeed. [...] Position errors may provide positive or negative errors, depending on one of several factors. [...] These factors include airspeed, angle of attack, aircraft weight, acceleration, aircraft configuration, {{and in the case of}} helicopters, rotor downwash. [...] There are two categories of position errors, which are [...] "fixed errors" [...] and [...] "variable errors". [...] Fixed errors are defined as errors which are specific to a particular model of aircraft. [...] Variable errors are caused by external factors such as deformed panels obstructing the flow of air, or particular situations which may <b>overstress</b> the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|When {{the book}} was released, Dugas' story became a {{controversial}} subject in the Canadian media. Shilts claimed that [...] "the Canadian press went crazy over the story" [...] and that [...] "Canadians... saw it as an offense to their nationhood." [...] The original study identifying Dugas as the index case had been completed by William Darrow, but it was called into question by University of California San Francisco epidemiologist Andrew Moss. Moss {{wrote in a letter}} to the editor of The New York Review of Books, [...] "There is very little evidence that Gaetan was 'patient zero' for the US or for California," [...] while also stating that Shilts did not <b>overstress</b> Dugas' lack of personal responsibility. Sandra Panem in Science uses Shilts' approach toward Dugas' behavior as an example of his [...] "glib" [...] treatment of the science involved in the epidemic. Author Douglas Crimp suggests that Shilts' representation of Dugas as [...] "murderously irresponsible" [...] is in actuality [...] "Shilts' homophobic nightmare of himself", and that Dugas is offered as a [...] "scapegoat for his heterosexual colleagues, in order to prove that , like them, is horrified by such creatures." [...] Many years later, in the 2000s, it was shown, by tracing the roots of the virus, that it had spread from Africa to Haiti, and then to the U.S. in the mid 1960s, before Dugas would have been very sexually active, if at all, and before he was working as a flight attendant.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the proposed research is to quantify the limits of <b>overstressed</b> and aging circuit breakers in terms of probability of failure and to provide guidelines to determine network reconfigurations, generator commitment, and economic dispatch strategies that account for these limits. The proposed temporary power system operating strategies address circuit breaker adequacy issues and allow <b>overstressed</b> breakers to be operated longer and more reliably until they are replaced with adequate equipment. The expansion of electric networks with new power sources (nuclear plants, distributed generation) results in increased short-circuit or fault currents levels. As fault currents increase, they will eventually exceed circuit breaker ratings. Circuit breakers exposed to fault currents in excess of their ratings {{are said to be}} <b>overstressed,</b> underrated, or inadequate. Insufficient ratings expose <b>overstressed</b> breakers to increased failure probabilities. Extensive common-mode outages caused by circuit breaker failures reduce the reliability of power systems. To durably avoid outages and system unreliability, <b>overstressed</b> breakers must eventually be replaced. Large-scale replacements of <b>overstressed</b> breakers cannot be completed in a short time because of budgetary limits, capital improvement schedules, and manufacturer-imposed constraints. Meanwhile, to preserve the ability of old and <b>overstressed</b> breakers to safely interrupt faults, short-circuit currents must be kept within the limits imposed by the ratings and the age of these breakers by using the substation reconfiguration and generator commitment strategies described in this study. The immediate benefit of the above-mentioned operating strategies is a reduction of the failure probability of <b>overstressed</b> breakers obtained by avoiding the interruption of currents in excess of breaker ratings. Other benefits include (i) increased network reliability, (ii) restored operating margins with respect to existing equipment, and (iii) prioritized equipment upgrades that enhance the long-term planning of power systems.

[...] During the life of the engine, the piston had been slowly wearing away. During the flight, the piston finally failed, causing the propeller to over-speed. [...] The propeller subsequently failed due to <b>overstress,</b> 1 to 2 seconds later. [...] When the propeller failed, the blades were hurled through the cabin, severing control cables as well as the structural integrity of the plane itself.

2500|$|On August 13, 1994, C-130A N135FF, c/n 3148, {{delivered}} as USAF 56-0540, in December 1957, {{call sign}} Tanker 82, crashed near Pearblossom, California while fighting {{a fire in}} the San Gabriel Mountains. Eyewitnesses reported seeing an explosion followed by the separation of the right wing at the wing attach point. Due to the extremely rugged terrain, the NTSB recovered {{only a small portion of}} the wreckage, and its preliminary conclusion that an explosion caused by a fuel leak led to the wing separation was based largely on eyewitness statements. A subsequent independent investigation in 1997 led by Douglas Herlihy, a former NTSB investigator, reexamined the site and the wreckage, and found no evidence of an explosion, but rather found evidence of structural failure due to fatigue stress. The NTSB subsequently reexamined its findings, and found evidence of fatigue cracking [...] "consistent with <b>overstress</b> separation", and ultimately revised their findings. The initial eyewitness reports of an explosion are not inconsistent with a fatigue-caused wing separation. Similar eyewitness reports were given in the 2002 crash, and an analysis of a video of that crash showed the initiation of a fireball 0.9 seconds after the wing separated.|$|E
2500|$|Of the 257 ships sunk by {{submarines}} from World War I convoys, {{only five}} were lost while aircraft assisted the surface escort. On 26 December 1917, as an airship was escorting three merchantmen out of Falmouth for their rendezvous with a convoy, they were attacked {{three times in}} the space of 90 minutes, torpedoing and sinking two of the vessels and narrowling missing the third before escaping. The airship had been [...] away {{at the time of the}} incident, which was one of the last of its kind. In 1918, U-boats attacked convoys escorted by both surface ships and aircraft only six times, sinking three ships in total out of thousands. Because of the decentralised nature of the convoy system, the RNAS had no say in the composition or use of air escorts. The northeast of England led the way in the use of aircraft for short- and long-range escort duty, but shore-based aerial [...] "hunting patrols" [...] were widely considered a superior use of air resources. Subsequent historians have not agreed, although they have tended to <b>overstress</b> the actual use made of aircraft in convoy escort duty. An Admiralty staff study in 1957 concluded that the convoy was the best defence against enemy attacks on shipping, and dismissed shore-based patrols while commending the use of air support in convoying.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study the effect of repeated tensile stresses above the proportional limit on 24 ST aluminum alloy. The investigation consisted in obtaining data on prepared specimens of 24 ST aluminum alloy in a machine capable of applying a pure tension stress, repeated many times a minute, without shock but with a high rate of loading. It was found that permanent deformation caused by <b>overstressing</b> is not a useful factor in forecasting the life expectancy of the specimen being tested. It was also found that the effects of "aging" (elapsed time between <b>overstresses),</b> initial stresses, and magnitude of <b>overstresses</b> applied, all have a definite influence on the ability of 24 ST aluminum alloy to withstand further <b>overstressing.</b> However, these effects are so scattered between different specimens of the same material that they cannot be determined accurately, either qualitatively or quantitatively, without a thorough statistical survey. It is considered that this investigation merely points the way to a further study of the behavior of all aircraft materials above the proportional limit.

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} histologic, immunohistochemical, {{and molecular}} changes in tendon induced by altered strain in a large-animal model. Methods. A full-thickness partial-width laceration of the infraspinatus tendon {{was created in}} 5 sheep, while 5 sham-operated sheep were used as controls. Sheep were killed after 4 weeks, and 4 differentially stressed tendon regions (tensile or near bone attachment from <b>overstressed</b> or stress-deprived halves) were evaluated for histopathology, proteoglycan (PG) accumulation, and characterization of glycosaminoglycans and aggrecan catabolites. Gene expression of matrix components, enzymes, and inhibitors was analyzed by reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction. Results. Histopathologic changes were detected in both <b>overstressed</b> and stress-deprived tensile tendon, but only in stress-deprived tendon near bone. In <b>overstressed</b> and stress-deprived tensile tendon, levels of keratan sulfate, chondroitin 4 -sulfate, and chondroitin 6 -sulfate were increased. In <b>overstressed</b> tensile tendon, levels of ADAMTS-generated aggrecan catabolites were increased. There was increased matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP- 13) and decreased fibromodulin and decorin expression in all regions. Increased MMP- 1, MMP- 9, MMP- 14, and ADAMTS- 1 expression, and decreased type II collagen expression were restricted to stress-deprived tendon. In stress-deprived bone-attachment regions, messenger RNA (mRNA) for aggrecan was decreased, and ADAMTS was increased. In <b>overstressed</b> tensile tendon, aggrecan mRNA was increased, and ADAMTS was decreased. Conclusion. The distinct molecular changes in adjacent tissue implicate altered strain rather than humoral factors in controlling abnormal tenocyte metabolism, and highlight the importance of regional sampling. Tendon abnormalities induced by increased strain are accompanied by increased aggrecan, decreased ADAMTS, and low PG expression, which may negatively impact the structural integrity of the tissue and predispose to rupture. 12 page(s...|$|R
