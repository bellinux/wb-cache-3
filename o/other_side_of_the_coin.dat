25|$|However, {{the desert}} tribes' {{relationship}} with the Romans was not exclusively hostile. The <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> is that many volunteered {{to serve in the}} Roman army, in both the regular auxilia and irregular native foederati (allied) units (although conscription was still common at this time - and was another cause of discontent). The army provided the prospect of a well-paid career which gave scope for the tribesmen's martial nature, which was highly regarded by the Romans. Numidian cavalry (equites Numidarum or Maurorum), which had played a prominent role in Roman armies since the Second Punic War (218-201 BC), were regarded as the best light cavalry in the Roman world. A Numidian cavalryman rode his small but agile and resilient desert mount without bridle, saddle or stirrups, restraining it by a loose rope round its neck and directing it by leg movements and voice commands. Unarmoured, he was protected by just a small round leather shield. His weaponry consisted of several javelins. Exceptionally fast and manoeuvrable, Numidian cavalry would harass the enemy by hit-and-run attacks, riding up and loosing volleys of javelins, then scattering and retreating faster than any opposing cavalry could pursue. They were superbly suited to scouting, harassment, ambush and pursuit. Numidian foot soldiers were also predominantly light infantry, relying on speed and manoeuvrability. However, both Numidian foot and mounted warriors were vulnerable in close-order combat with Roman troops, who mainly wore metal armour.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} reasons why Ganteaume played no further Test cricket after his single match. Apart from {{the slow pace}} of his batting during that hundred—Goddard later suggested {{that it would have been}} better for Ganteaume's career to score a rapid 60 than a slow hundred— West Indies' batting was strong at the time and there was plenty of competition for places in the team. Even so, his teammate and later West Indies captain Jeff Stollmeyer suggested that he was unlucky to be left out of subsequent teams. It is also possible that Ganteaume was affected by his attitude to authority. The cricket journalist Martin Williamson suggests: [...] "Ganteaume probably paid as much for his anti-establishment attitude as for slow scoring. He was certainly not someone who was going to bow and scrape to the white players who still dominated the region's cricket." [...] In later years, Ganteaume served as a Test selector and was West Indies manager in 1973–74. In 2007, his autobiography, My Story: The <b>Other</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coin</b> was published, in which he criticised the West Indies [...] "establishment" [...] of his playing days. He died at the age of 95 on 17 February 2016. At the time of his death he was the oldest surviving West Indies Test cricketer, and the second oldest in the world.|$|E

500|$|Into {{the reign}} of King George III (1760–1820), the silver penny {{continued}} to be used mostly as a Maundy piece. Pennies {{similar to those of}} previous reigns, but bearing George III's head and the inscription GEORGIVS III DEI GRATIA, were struck in 1763, 1766, 1770, 1772, 1776, 1779, 1780, 1781, 1784 and 1786. A new bust of the King was introduced to the penny in 1792, and was struck dated that year, 1795, and 1800. The third, laureated bust of the king with an unchanged obverse inscription was on the silver penny in 1817, 1818 and 1820. George III's first reverse, used until 1780, showed the crowned [...] "I" [...] in high relief, with the inscription MAG BRI FR ET HIB REX. [...] A modification was made in 1781, with the relief of the central [...] "I" [...] on the reverse lowered, likely because part of the outline of the I had been visible on the King's head on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin.</b> This second reverse, used until 1786, was similar but in lower relief, the [...] "I" [...] being much flatter; the third reverse, used in 1792 only, was completely redesigned with a much smaller [...] "I" [...] under a smaller crown with the inscription running around the crown, with the same legend as before. The fourth reverse, used in 1795 and 1800 was similar to the first but with a redesigned crown. The fifth reverse, used from 1817, showed the crowned [...] "I" [...] with the inscription BRITANNIARUM REX FID DEF and the date. From 1817, the diameter of the coin was reduced from 12 to 11 millimetres, although the weight remained the same at [...]5 grams.|$|E

The <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> was the reliance of cricket as a professional sport upon the investment accrued through gambling interests.

The fact is, if you bring your established conception of U2 to this record, you'll be disappointed." [...] Kurt Loder was more critical in Rolling Stone, [...] "U2 flickers and nearly fades, its fire banked by a misconceived production strategy and occasional interludes of soggy, songless self-indulgence. This is not a 'bad' album, but neither is it the irrefutable beauty the band's fans anticipated." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau felt Bono's moralizing and [...] "wild romantic idealism" [...] proved careless, specifically on [...] "Pride" [...] and [...] "Elvis Presley and America", but concluded that those qualities work well enough for him {{throughout the rest of}} the album [...] "to make a skeptic believe temporarily in miracles".

2500|$|Gold perpera [...] - It is {{the only}} {{surviving}} gold coin, not only of a medieval Bulgarian monarch, but also of any Slavonic ruler of the period. One example was found in 1934 among other coins {{in the area of}} Prilep (contemporary Republic of Macedonia). It is now in the National Archaeological Museum of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. Its weight is 4.33 g, the diameter is 33mm, and it is made of 16 carat gold. The shape is slightly hollow. On one side Ivan Asen II and Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki are depicted upright. With one of his hands the Saint gives the Emperor a sword and with the other he is placing a crown on Ivan Asen's head. The inscription is in Bulgarian and abbreviated, and says: [...] "Ivan Asen, Tsar" [...] and [...] "Saint Dimitar". On the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> is depicted Christ Pantocrator. The inscription is [...] "Jesus Christ, Tsar of the Glory".

He also presents the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin,</b> showing some black Africans as heroes and heroines (such as Ignosi), and showing respect for their culture. The book expresses much less prejudice than some of the later books in this genre. Indeed, Quatermain states that he refuses to use the word [...] "nigger" [...] and that many Africans are more worthy of the title of [...] "gentleman" [...] than the Europeans who settle or adventure in the country. Haggard even includes an interracial romance between a Kukuana woman, Foulata, and the white Englishman Captain Good. The narrator tries to discourage the relationship, dreading the uproar that such a marriage would cause back home in England; however, he has no objection to the lady, whom he considers very beautiful and noble. Haggard soon [...] "kills off" [...] Foulata, who dies in Good's arms.|$|E
2500|$|The Rally GT and the Rally SST did not {{disappear}} completely this year; {{this can be}} described that they were downgraded from being trim levels to optional packages that were offered by several VAM dealerships.

2500|$|Even casual {{conversation}} with the computer's operators, or with a human guard, could allow such a superintelligent AI to deploy psychological tricks, ranging from befriending to blackmail, to convince a human gatekeeper, truthfully or deceitfully, that it's in the gatekeeper's interest to agree to allow the AI greater access to the outside world. The AI might offer a gatekeeper a recipe for perfect health, immortality, or whatever the gatekeeper is believed to most desire; on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin,</b> the AI could threaten that it will do horrific things to the gatekeeper and his family once it [...] "inevitably" [...] escapes. One strategy to attempt to box the AI would be to allow the AI to respond to narrow multiple-choice questions whose answers would benefit human science or medicine, but otherwise bar all other communication with or observation of the AI. A more lenient [...] "informational containment" [...] strategy would restrict the AI to a low-bandwidth text-only interface, which would at least prevent emotive imagery {{or some kind of}} hypothetical [...] "hypnotic pattern". Note that on a technical level, no system can be completely isolated and still remain useful: even if the operators refrain from allowing the AI to communicate and instead merely run the AI for the purpose of observing its inner dynamics, the AI could strategically alter its dynamics to influence the observers. For example, the AI could choose to creatively malfunction in a way that increases the probability that its operators will become lulled into {{a false sense of security}} and choose to reboot and then de-isolate the system.|$|E

6000|$|Our last {{paper of}} this veracious and {{roundabout}} series {{related to a}} period {{which can only be}} historical to a great number of readers of this Magazine. Four I saw at the station to-day with orange-covered books in their hands, who can but have known George IV. by books, and statues, and pictures. Elderly gentlemen were in their prime, old men in their middle age, when he reigned over us. His image remains on coins; on a picture or two hanging here and there in a Club or old-fashioned dining-room; on horseback, as at Trafalgar Square, for example, where I defy any monarch to look more uncomfortable. He turns up in sundry memoirs and histories which have been published of late days; in Mr. Massey's [...] "History;" [...] in the [...] "Buckingham and Grenville Correspondence;" [...] and gentlemen who have accused a certain writer of disloyalty are referred to those volumes to see whether the picture drawn of George is overcharged. Charon has paddled him off; he has mingled with the crowded republic of the dead. His effigy smiles from a canvas or two. Breechless he bestrides his steed in Trafalgar Square. I believe he still wears his robes at Madame Tussaud's (Madame herself having quitted Baker Street and life, and found him she modelled t'other side the Stygian stream). On the head of a five-shilling piece we still occasionally come upon him, with St. George, the dragon-slayer, on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coin.</b> Ah me! did this George slay many dragons? Was he a brave, heroic champion, and rescuer of virgins? Well! well! have you and I overcome all the dragons that assail US? come alive and victorious out of all the caverns which we have entered in life, and succored, at risk of life and limb, all poor distressed persons in whose naked limbs the dragon Poverty is about to fasten his fangs, whom the dragon Crime is poisoning with his horrible breath, and about to crunch up and devour? O my royal liege! O my gracious prince and warrior! YOU a champion to fight that monster? Your feeble spear ever pierce that slimy paunch or plated back? See how the flames come gurgling out of his red-hot brazen throat! What a roar! Nearer and nearer he trails, with eyes flaming like the lamps of a railroad engine. How he squeals, rushing out through the darkness of his tunnel! Now he is near. Now he is HERE. And now--what?--lance, shield, knight, feathers, horse and all? O horror, horror! Next day, round the monster's cave, there lie a few bones more. You, who wish to keep yours in your skins, be thankful that you are not called upon to go out and fight dragons. Be grateful that they don't sally out and swallow you. Keep a wise distance from their caves, lest you pay too dearly for approaching them. Remember that years passed, and whole districts were ravaged, before the warrior came who was able to cope with the devouring monster. When that knight DOES make his appearance, with all my heart let us go out and welcome him with our best songs, huzzas, and laurel wreaths, and eagerly recognize his valor and victory. But he comes only seldom. Countless knights were slain before St. George won the battle. In the battle of life are we all going to try for the honors of championship? If we can do our duty, if we can keep our place pretty honorably through the combat, let us say, Laus Deo! at the end of it, as the firing ceases, and the night falls over the field.|$|E
