40|$|A {{bacterial}} strain was constructed which permitted positive selection for ochre suppressor mutations {{as well as}} for the loss of suppressor function. A derivative bearing an <b>ochre</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation</b> was selected following mutagenesis with N-methyl-N-nitroso-N'-nitroguanidine. The suppressor-bearing strain was treated with nitrous acid to eliminate suppressor function by mutation, and a strain lacking suppressor activity was selected. The selected strain which had lost suppressor function was then subjected to mutagenesis to induce a second suppressor mutation. The alternating sequence (induction of an <b>ochre</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation</b> → induction of a mutation eliminating ochre suppressor activity) was repeated 29 and one-half times in a single strain. Some of the suppressor mutations were tentatively mapped at four locations on the chromosome. The first suppressor mutation selected maps at about minute 30 on the chromosome. The second suppressor selected maps at approximately minute 60, while the third suppressor maps nearby, possibly as far as minute 72. Among the subsequently selected suppressor mutations, all eleven which were mapped were cotransducible with the gal and nic loci near minute 36 on the chromosome and may represent more than one suppressor gene. Deletions were selected which inactivate two of the ochre suppressor alleles mapping near the gal-nic region, suggesting that one or more such genes are dispensable. Some evidence also suggests that the occurrence of either deletion mutations or transduction-mediated recombination events in the gal-nic region can cause instability of nearby suppressor alleles...|$|E
40|$|It was {{previously}} {{shown that the}} <b>ochre</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation</b> sup 15 B in Escherichia coli determines the accumulation of altered 30 S ribosomal subunits {{and the presence of}} altered transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) capable of suppressing in vitro the UAG codon. This mutation has been mapped in the present study by means of conjugation and transduction experiments. After establishing the location of sup 15 B near argH, the following order was determined for the markers tested: metB-argH-(sup 15 B, supA 36) -rif-thi. A comparison of location, growth rate, and suppressor pattern determined by sup 15 B and supM indicates the high probability that both suppressor mutations are identical. This study has also yielded a more precise location for the rifampin resistance gene. The most interesting finding is the very close (if not adjacent) location of the suppressor mutations sup 15 B and supA 36, both of which determine tRNA alterations...|$|E
40|$|A {{polypeptide}} chain-terminating {{mutation in}} the yeast mitochondrial oxi 1 gene {{has been shown}} to be an ochre (TAA) mutation by DNA sequence analysis. Mitochondrially inherited revertants of this mutation include two types: In the first, the ochre codon has been changed to a sense codon by further mutation in the oxi 1 gene while, in the second, the ochre codon is still present, indicating the occurrence of an extrageneic <b>ochre</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation.</b> This mitochondrial ochre suppressor, termed MSU 1, has been "cloned" in rho- strains of yeast and tested against other oxi 1 mutations. Several additional mutations are also suppressible, and those examined so far are also ochre mutations. MSU 1 does not suppress known frameshift or missense mutations at oxi 1. Isoelectric focusing of the gene product (cytochrome oxidase subunit II) from a suppressed-mutant strain indicates that suppression does not involve insertion of charged amino acids. Physical mapping of the mtDNA retained in the MSU 1 -carrying rho- clones localizes the suppressor mutation to the gene coding the 15 S rRNA or a site not more than 300 base pairs from it. No known tRNA genes occur this close to the 15 S rRNA gene, and mtDNA from a suppressor-carrying rho- does not hybridize detectably to mitochondrial tRNAs. These results suggest that MSU 1 may be an alteration in the 15 S rRNA...|$|E
40|$|Amber and <b>ochre</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> in Salmonella typhimurium were selected. The {{amino acid}} insertions {{directed}} by the suppressors were inferred from suppression patterns of Escherichia coli lacI amber mutations. These amber mutations only respond to nonsense suppressors that direct the insertion of particular amino acids. Four Salmonella amber suppressors characterized insert serine, glutamine, tyrosine, and (probably) leucine. Of the three <b>ochre</b> <b>suppressors</b> characterized, two direct the insertion of tyrosine and one directs that of lysine.

40|$|Prototrophic mutants {{produced}} by UV light in Escherichia coli K- 12 strains with argE 3 (Oc) and hisG 4 (Oc) defects are distinguished as backmutations and specific nonsense <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations.</b> In strains carrying a umuC defect, mutants are not produced unless irradiated cells are incubated and then exposed to photoreversing light (delayed photoreversal mutagenesis). The mutants thus produced {{are found to}} be specifically <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> and not backmutations. The <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> are primarily glutamine tRNA <b>ochre</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations,</b> which have been attributed previously to mutation targeted at T = C pyrimidine dimers. In a lexA 51 recA 441 strain, where the SOS mutagenesis functions are constitutive, targeting at dimers is confirmed by demonstrating that the induction of glutamine tRNA <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> is susceptible to photoreversal. In the same strain induction of backmutations is not susceptible to photoreversal. Thus delayed photoreversal mutagenesis produces <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> that can be targeted at pyrimidine dimers and does not produce backmutations that are not targeted at pyrimidine dimers. This correlation supports the idea that delayed photoreversal mutagenesis in umuC defective cells reflects a mutation process arrested at a targeting pyrimidine dimer photoproduct, which is the immediate cause of both the alteration in DNA sequence and the obstruction (unless repaired) to mutation fixation and ultimate expression...|$|R

These observations justify the conclusions that the <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation</b> did not occur in a structural gene for a ribosomal component, and that the decreased growth rate in rich medium, the increased sensitivity to streptomycin, and the production of altered 30 S ribosomes are probably all secondary consequences of the <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> of Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{have been}} identified. An isolate of strain PAT, {{initially}} selected as being temperature sensitive for growth, {{was found to}} suppress two different auxotrophic <b>mutations.</b> A <b>suppressor</b> locus, designated sup- 1, has been mapped and is co-transducible with three closely linked thr loci. The <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation</b> {{has been used to}} isolate suppressor-sensitive (sus) mutants of the virulent phage E 79 and the R factor R 18. By selecting for revertants of auxotrophic markers, other sup mutants have been isolated and are found to be of two types, either temperature sensitive for growth like the original mutant or showing wild-type growth at 43 C. The mutations giving rise to both these classes of suppressor are very closely linked. One of the sup- 1 alleles of strain PAT also shows suppressor activity when transferred into P. aeruginosa strain PAO. Escherichia coli strains carrying the nonsense suppressors supC, supD, or supF do not suppress the sus mutant of R 18. This suggests that sup- 1 is different from the amber and <b>ochre</b> <b>suppressors</b> of the enterobacteria...|$|R

The sequence of the supN tRNALys {{is identical to the}} sequence of <b>ochre</b> <b>suppressor</b> tRNAs encoded by mutant alleles at the lysT locus.

40|$|A new {{suppressor}} of + 1 frameshift mutations {{has been}} isolated in Salmonella typhimurium. This suppressor, sufJ, maps at minute 89 on the Salmonella genetic map between the argH and rpo(rif) loci, {{closely linked to}} the gene for the <b>ochre</b> <b>suppressor</b> tyrU(supM). The <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation</b> is dominant to its wild-type allele, consistent with the suppressor phenotype being caused by an altered tRNA species. The sufJ map position coincides with that of a threonine tRNA(ACC/U) gene; the suppressor has been shown to read the related fourbase codons ACCU, ACCC, ACCA. —The ability of sufJ to correct one particular mutation depends on the presence of a hisT mutation which causes a defect in tRNA modification. This requirement is allele specific, since other frameshift mutations can be corrected by sufJ regardless {{of the state of the}} hisT locus. —Strains carrying both a sufJ and a hisT mutation are acutely sensitive to growth inhibition by uracil; the inhibition is reversed by arginine. This behavior is characteristic of strains with mutations affecting the arginine-uracil biosynthetic enzyme carbamyl phosphate synthetase.

40|$|A Salmonella typhimurium strain {{was given}} the amber {{mutation}} hisC 527 by transduction, made galactose-negative by mutation, then infected with the F′- 1 -gal factor. Of 107 spontaneous and mutagen-induced histidine-independent mutants tested, 3 proved to result from <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> within the F′ factor. The mutant F′ factors, when transferred to S. typhimurium and E. coli auxotrophs, suppressed amber and ochre but not UGA or missense mutants, and are inferred to carry <b>ochre</b> <b>suppressor</b> genes. Attempts to isolate an F′ amber suppressor mutant were unsuccessful. A suppressor F′ factor was transferred to 14 rough mutants which had been isolated from LT 2 hisC 527 (amber) by selection for resistance to phage P 22. c 2. One rough mutant was partly suppressed, as shown by its acquisition of O agglutinability and by alterations in its phage resistance pattern. Phage P 22 h grown on the suppressed mutant contransduced its rf. gene with cysE+ and with pyrE+, and the affected locus is inferred to be rfaL. Both the original and the mutant F′ factors conferred resistance to the rough-specific phage Br 60, which is therefore “female-specific. ...|$|R
40|$|Analyses of <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> {{have been}} {{extremely}} valuable in understanding gene function. However, techniques for mapping <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> are not available for most bacterial species. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing technology to identify spontaneously arising <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> that enabled disruption of rpoE (which encodes σE) in Vibrio cholerae, the agent of cholera. The alternative sigma factor σE, which is activated by envelope stress, promotes expression of factors that help preserve and/or restore cell envelope integrity. In Escherichia coli, rpoE is an essential gene {{that can only be}} disrupted in the presence of additional <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations.</b> Among a panel of independent V. cholerae rpoE mutants, more than 75 % contain <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> that reduce production of OmpU, V. cholerae’s principal outer membrane porin. OmpU appears to be a key determinant of V. cholerae’s requirement for and production of σE. Such dependence upon a single factor contrasts markedly with regulation of σE in E. coli, in which numerous factors contribute to its activation and none is dominant. We also identified a <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation</b> that differs from all previously described suppressors in that it elevates, rather than reduces, σE’s activity. Finally, analyses of a panel of rpoE mutants shed light on the mechanisms by which <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> may arise in V. cholerae...|$|R
40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} suppressor mutants {{derived from}} tRNATrp genes {{have never been}} identified in S. cerevisiae. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to generate potential <b>ochre</b> and opal <b>suppressors</b> from a cloned tRNATrp gene. In vitro transcription analyses show the <b>ochre</b> <b>suppressor</b> form of the gene, TRPO, accumulates precursors and tRNA in amounts comparable to the parent. The opal suppressor, TRPOP, accumulates 4 - 5 fold less tRNA. Both forms of the gene are processed and spliced in vitro to produce tRNAs with the expected base sequences. The altered genes were subcloned into yeast vectors and introduced into yeast strains carrying a variety of amber, ochre, and opal mutations. When introduced on a CEN vector, neither <b>ochre</b> nor opal <b>suppressor</b> forms show suppressor activity. Deletion of the CEN region from the clones increases the copy number to 10 - 20 /cell. The opal suppressor form shows moderate suppressor activity when the gene is introduced on this vector, however, the <b>ochre</b> <b>suppressor</b> form exhibits no detectable biological activity regardless of gene copy number.

Restoration of wild-type p 53 function to cancer cells that have lost it might therefore improve treatment outcomes. Using a systematic yeast genetic approach, we selected second-site <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> that can overcome the deleterious effects of common p 53 cancer mutations in human cells. We identified several <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> for the V 143 A, G 245 S and R 249 S cancer mutations.

Further experiments showed that these <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> could override additional p 53 cancer mutations.

Termination at an amber codon of a NS 1 gene of another influenza virus strain was not suppressed by the (Su+) ochre gene suggesting that in mammalian cells amber codons are not recognized by <b>ochre</b> <b>suppressor</b> tRNAs.

A sup(+) sal 4 - 2 strain also showed a temperature-dependent omnipotent suppressor phenotype, enhancing readthrough of all three termination codons. Combining the sal 4 - 2 allele with an efficient tRNA nonsense suppressor (SUP 4) increased the temperature-sensitivity of that strain, indicating that enhanced nonsense suppressor levels contribute to the conditional-lethality conferred by the sal 4 - 2 allele. However, UGA suppression levels in a sup(+) sal 4 - 2 strain following a shift to the non-permissive temperature reached a maximum significantly below that exhibited by a non-temperature sensitive SUP 4 suppressor strain.

To address the mechanism by which these mutations restore Raf signaling, we have introduced the <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> into the analogous residues of mammalian Raf- 1. Here, we show that rather than compensating for the RBS mutation by restoring the Ras-Raf- 1 interaction, the <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> increase the enzymatic and biological activity of Raf- 1, allowing Raf- 1 to signal in the absence of Ras binding. Surprisingly, we find that while one of the <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> (P 181 L) increases the basal kinase activity of Raf- 1, it also abolishes the ability of wild-type Raf- 1 to become activated by Ras. This mutation occurs in the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of Raf- 1 and demonstrates the importance of this region for a productive Ras-Raf interaction. Finally, we present evidence that the most activating <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation</b> (G 498 S) increases Raf- 1 activity by introducing a novel phosphorylation site into the L 12 activation loop of the Raf- 1 kinase domain...|$|R
