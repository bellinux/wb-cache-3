500|$|According to a 1987 {{interview}} with reporter Roger Starr of The New York Times, she learned much about pool through such activities but [...] "she also learned that, even in fun, pool stars {{did not like}} losing in public, especially not to children, and less, even, to girl children. She also discovered that young men, including her brothers, shared the feeling of shame over losing to girls. She recalls, 'Whenever my brother Paul, the youngest of my four brothers, beat me at pool on the table downstairs at home, he would run through the house shouting 'I won, I beat her'. I guess that was <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> worked all the harder at my game.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times spent a full {{paragraph}} on a vignette {{about two}} high school prom dresses. [...] The junior prom dress was a conservative powder blue gown to wear with a nerdy date. The senior prom dress was a sexy black mini dress that was befitting of her more desirable date. The dresses presented an identity crisis to one character: [...] "Here's the thing – I've never really known for sure which {{of those two}} people I am – the girl who almost doesn't get asked to the prom at all or the girl who gets {{to go with the}} really cute guy. Every time I thought I knew which one I was, I {{turned out to be the}} other. Which is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> think I got married, to, like, end the confusion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on {{rumors about}} her life, Hunt said of an {{apocryphal}} story: [...] "You must have read {{that on the}} internet. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> haven't had it removed {{is that it is}} proof that the Internet is full of absolute bullshit. Ridiculous things have been written about me so often that we won't even go there." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The last news I had {{indicated}} that I was wanted," [...] he replied. [...] "After all, {{there is only}} <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> have abused Mrs. Chisholm's hospitality so long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{do that at}} once, by {{telephone}}. That's <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> came over. I'll telephone the steamship office {{while the}} girl is getting ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he answered, [...] "for <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> {{generally}} call {{here when}} I'm {{going to the}} bluff. It's convenient to get there for supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hadn't {{a notion}} that you disliked him," [...] said Austen. [...] "I am curious about his career; that's <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> came down. He somehow inspires curiosity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, then!" [...] I flung her Mark's letter. There wasn't {{anything}} {{in it that}} it was sacrilege to let another person see. That was <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> had been crying.|$|R
6000|$|... "The joke {{of it is}} that I, too, {{am being}} watched whereever I go. That fellow Streuss has spies everywhere. That is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> believe that Von Behrling was serious.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not mention}} it," [...] exclaimed Dickory, with a shudder; [...] "that was <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>I</b> ran away; I {{preferred}} any danger from man or beast to {{that he was}} taking me to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{on account}} of my red hair," [...] she {{explained}} smiling. [...] "I do not care for red hair myself, which is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> usually wear other forms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I meant {{his visit}} to the Farquhar {{homestead}} when I told him about Lucy; but I'll try to answer you. For <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> wanted to make amends for my previous--rashness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{she said}} slowly, [...] "I can't {{denounce}} your folly, {{as they call}} your decision to go North. For <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> have no right of any kind to force my views on you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not in his}} outfit. My job's with Miss Sampson. She's fine, but the old man? Nit! He's {{been after}} me for weeks. I won't last long. That's <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> want to start up for myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is all over,' said Theodora. 'I {{have told}} him that it cannot be. I am glad, for <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> that <b>I</b> shall not seem to deceive you any more. Has papa told you what he thinks my history!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is of no}} use to talk to Flora," [...] said Ethel; [...] "she {{would say}} it was high-flown and visionary. Oh! she wants it for the bazaar's own sake, and that is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> hate it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you can't {{say that}} I'm not honest. It is {{positively}} my only virtue. I adore the truth. I loathe a lie. That is <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> daresay, why I can only barely tolerate you. You are a shocking--a gross liar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, he isn't," [...] said Honora, rather breathlessly; [...] "that's {{the reason}} I came here. That's <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> mean. I {{was coming to}} see you this morning, but I simply didn't {{have time for a}} call after I got to town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{and that}} is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> don't want to give her up; it seems so sad to send Maurice's child away leaving such an impression. One thing I am. thankful for, {{that it will be}} all over before grandmamma and Bessie Merrifield come.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On principle, my dear. For <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> because <b>I</b> {{have such}} sympathy {{with women who}} toil, and for another, I believe {{the time has come}} when women must no longer be slaves, they must assert themselves, become individuals, independent." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{knew he was}} acting, as well {{as though}} he had climbed upon the table and said it. And yet he had struck the very note of my own fears, and hit upon the <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> had not confessed lung ago.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> am {{determined}} to go at once. If any trouble is to come of your drive, I want it over as soon as possible, and the sooner I show myself in Sawyer, the more satisfied I shall feel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you again, Peter," [...] cried Dotty, [...] "and {{please let}} me return the compliment. I like cold weather. I like winter when there isn't too much ice and bad weather. I always feel good in cold weather. That is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> go north to nest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure!" [...] responded Nerle. [...] "Let us hope, at any rate, that {{we shall}} suffer more privations and {{encounter}} more trouble than we did in that mountainous Kingdom of Spor." [...] Then he added: [...] "For <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> regret you are my master." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why,' said Captain Charteris, 'I hardly know. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> came alone was, that I {{believe that}} little elf of a Cilly has some {{notion of what}} is {{plotting}} against her. You can't speak a word but that child catches up, and she will not let her father out of her sight for a moment.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pooh!' said Harriet pettishly, jerking {{the ribbon}} by {{which she was}} leading Fido: 'give me <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> Lucy, and <b>I</b> will come.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I do {{not love}} him the less for that reason; I think I love him the more. I never, never, could have loved anyone else, mamma; never, never; {{and that is}} <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> do not so much mind being ill now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess my}} best days are done, {{and that is}} <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> wish {{to end up with}} a big success," [...] he said. [...] "I got a plain warning from the Vancouver doctor you brought me in that morning. You managed it smartly." ...|$|R
6000|$|Godfrey Palliser smiled curiously. “Tony {{has many}} likable qualities, {{but he is}} weak,” he said. “That, my dear is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> am glad {{that he is going}} to marry you, for it is a burden I shall, I think very shortly, {{bequeath}} him. You will help him to lighten it, as well as bear it honorably.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR WILSON,--In every letter I {{tell you}} I'm better! Why, pretty soon there'll be {{nothing left to}} say about my health. I've been up and around now for days, but only lately have I begun to gain. Since Jack has been away I'm getting fat. I eat, and that's <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> suppose. Then I move around more.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> did it," [...] said I. [...] "I didn't want {{to fight}} him as I should have fought a fellow of my own size. I wanted to punish him. Do you think that when a father wants to whip his son he ought to wait until he grows up as big as he is?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{had said}} I would help {{someone else and}} that is <b>one</b> of the <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> was {{reluctant}} but the draft was so big," [...] Palmer stated.|$|R
60|$|Had I {{had less}} to do I would have been lonely {{in a city where}} I hardly knew a soul. But my work kept me so busy I had no time to think of myself, and perhaps this is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> did not rebel before I did.|$|R
6000|$|... "I daresay not. I am too {{experienced}} {{a doctor to}} cheapen my prescriptions in that way. However, here is <b>one</b> good <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> have noticed, sir, that at your age a man is either a slave to a pipe or to a woman. Do {{you want me to}} lend you a pipe now?" ...|$|R
