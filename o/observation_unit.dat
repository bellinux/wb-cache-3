25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Campbell denounced Nazi Germany and returned to Britain. He did duty as an Air Raid Precautions warden in London. During this period he met and befriended Dylan Thomas, a fellow alcoholic, with whom he once ate a vase of daffodils in celebration of St. David's Day. Although he was over draft age and in bad physical shape, as well as having a bad hip, Campbell finally managed to get enlisted in the British Army. He was accepted by the Intelligence Corps because of his knowledge of languages and began training as a private with the Royal Welch Fusiliers on 1 April 1942. Having completed basic training, Campbell was transferred in July to the I.C. Depot near Winchester, where he was trained in motorcycles. In February 1943 he was promoted to sergeant, and in March he was posted to British East Africa. On 5 May, he arrived in Nairobi and was attached to the King's African Rifles, serving in a camp two miles outside the city. After having worked as a military censor he was transferred in June to the 12th <b>Observation</b> <b>Unit</b> of the commando force being trained for jungle warfare against the Japanese. However, any hope of seeing real action in the Far East was thwarted when Campbell during training in late July suffered a new injury to his damaged hip in a fall from a motorcycle. He was sent back to hospital in Nairobi, where the doctors examined an X-ray of his hips and declared him unfit for active duty.|$|E

40|$|Vertices Principal Component Analysis (V-PCA) and Centers Principal Component Analysis (C-PCA) are {{variants}} of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) {{to deal with}} two-way interval-valued data. In this case the <b>observation</b> <b>units</b> are represented as hyperrectangles instead of points. Tucker 3 and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC are component analysis techniques to analyze the underlying structure of three-way data sets. In the present paper, after recalling the above mentioned methods, we extend the C-PCA and V-PCA methods to deal with three-way interval-valued data by means of Tucker 3 and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC and we describe how to represent the <b>observation</b> <b>units</b> in the obtained low-dimensional space. Furthermore, an application of the extended methods-called Three-way Vertices Principal Component Analysis (3 V-PCA) and Three-way Centers Principal Component Analysis (3 C-PCA) -to three-way interval-valued air pollution data is described.

Nevertheless, some questions of importance have been left unanswered, e. g. none of the papers using this method has provided a consistent interpretation of the terms usually referred to as “speaker weights”. This study at-tempts an exploration of what influences their reliability as a first step towards their consistent interpretation. With this in mind, we undertook a systematic comparison of the classical PARAFAC 1 algorithm with a relaxed version, of it, PARAFAC 2. This comparison was carried out on two different corpora acquired by the articulograph, which varied in vowel qualities, consonantal contexts, and the paralinguistic fea-tures accent and speech rate.

40|$|Objects {{perform better}} than pixels when {{estimating}} aboveground biomass and Leaf Area Index (LAI) from hyperspectral data. An essential question though, {{is how to}} define the objects. With per-pixel classification all <b>observation</b> <b>units</b> are square pixels of fixed dimensions. With object-oriented the <b>observation</b> <b>units</b> (objects) are groups of contiguous pixels. The objects can be de-fined either by stratification, i. e. based on an external variable (e. g. soil type), or by segmentation, i. e. based on spectral similarity. In the latter case, the maximal spectral heterogeneity defined by the user, determines {{the size and shape}} of the resulting objects. It is therefore crucial to find the optimal heterogeneity. Furthermore, the bands included in the segmentation process will have a significant effect as well. This paper aims at finding the band combination that results in optimal predictions. Optimal being defined as lowest prediction errors. A field campaign was hold to collect biomass and LAI data for over 200 plots in the Peyne catch-ment in southern France. These data were linked to a HyMap image. The optimal band combination will be found with Lasso regression, which is a shrinkage method.
