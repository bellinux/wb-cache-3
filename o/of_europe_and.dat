5|$|After {{leaving the}} White House, the Pierces {{remained}} in Washington {{for more than}} two months, staying with former Secretary of State Marcy. Buchanan altered course from the Pierce administration, replacing all of his appointees. The Pierces eventually moved to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where Pierce had begun to speculate in property. Seeking warmer weather, he and Jane spent the next three years traveling, beginning with a stay in Madeira and followed by tours <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> the Bahamas.

5|$|Averianov, Archibald, and Martin instead placed UA 8699 in {{the context}} of faunal {{similarity}} and exchange between the late Cretaceous faunas <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> Africa, noting the presence of similar animals, such as snakes (Medtsoia) and sauropods (Lirainosaurus and Repetosaurus), in the Cretaceous faunas of Madagascar and the Spanish locality Laño. They proposed the relationship between Lainodon, which is from Laño, and UA 8699 as another example of this relationship and cited a previous prediction by Gheerbrant and Astibia that zhelestids similar to Lainodon would be found in Africa.|$|E

Hoopoes were considered sacred in Ancient Egypt and symbols of virtue in Persia, but were thought of as thieves across much <b>of</b> <b>Europe,</b> <b>and</b> harbingers of war in Scandinavia.|$|E

In the Canary Islands, the red-billed chough is now extinct on two of the islands on which it formerly bred, and the Alpine was lost from the archipelago altogether.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{are often}} grown in greenhouses, {{particularly}} in regions unsuited to {{the cultivation of}} cacti outdoors, such the northern parts <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> North America. Here, they may be kept in pots or grown in the ground. Cacti are also grown as houseplants, many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere. Cacti in pots may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios, and then kept under cover during the winter. Less drought-resistant epiphytes, such as epiphyllum hybrids, Schlumbergera (the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus) and Hatiora (the Easter cactus), are widely cultivated as houseplants.|$|E

Daybreaker was praised by music writers for its variety.|$|E

5|$|During {{the decade}} of the 530s, it seemed to many that God had {{abandoned}} the Christian Roman Empire.

5|$|His {{life and}} with it his reign, which were longer than any other British monarch before him, were marked {{by a series of}} {{military}} conflicts involving his kingdoms, much of the rest <b>of</b> <b>Europe,</b> <b>and</b> places farther afield in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War, becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. However, many of Britain's American colonies were soon lost in the American War of Independence. Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.|$|E
