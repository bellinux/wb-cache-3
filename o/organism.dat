5|$|A {{habitat is}} an {{ecological}} or environmental {{area that is}} inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of <b>organism.</b> The term typically refers to the zone in which the <b>organism</b> lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an <b>organism</b> lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.|$|E
5|$|An {{adaptive}} trait is {{an aspect}} of the developmental pattern of the <b>organism</b> which enables or enhances the probability of that <b>organism</b> surviving and reproducing.|$|E
5|$|For {{multicellular}} organisms, {{typically the}} embryo is engineered which grows into the adult genetically modified <b>organism.</b> However, the genomes of cells {{in an adult}} <b>organism</b> can be edited using gene therapy techniques to treat genetic diseases.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} model <b>organisms</b> {{began with the}} idea that certain <b>organisms</b> can be studied and used to gain {{knowledge}} of other <b>organisms</b> or as a control (ideal) for other <b>organisms</b> of the same species. Model <b>organisms</b> offer standards that serve as the authorized basis for comparison of other <b>organisms.</b> Model <b>organisms</b> are made standard by limiting genetic variance, creating, hopefully, this broad applicability to other <b>organisms.</b>|$|R

25|$|Multicellular <b>organisms</b> are <b>organisms</b> that {{consist of}} more than one cell, in {{contrast}} to single-celled <b>organisms.</b>|$|R
5|$|Mimicry {{occurs when}} an <b>organism</b> (the mimic) simulates signal {{properties}} of another <b>organism</b> (the model) to confuse a third <b>organism.</b> This {{results in the}} mimic gaining protection, food, and mating advantages. There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and Müllerian. Both involve aposematic coloration, or warning signals, to avoid being attacked by a predator.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of most {{specimens}} {{was made}} possible by the fast sedimentation that quickly cut the <b>organism</b> off from seawater; it may also have been enhanced by the decay products of the rotting <b>organism,</b> which could have helped the overlying sediment to mineralise and harden. It has been suggested that a mucus trail produced by the <b>organism</b> may have assisted its preservation, but experiments suggest that mucus disintegrates too easily {{to play a role in}} binding sediment together.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an <b>organism</b> requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the <b>organism</b> cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular <b>organism.</b> For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E

Bacteriol. 86 : 956 – 965. 1963. —When grown on cycloheximide-containing solid medium, Saccharomyces pastorianus {{gave rise to}} rough colonies, consisting of two morphologically and physiologically different kinds of <b>organisms,</b> named primary colony <b>organisms</b> and secondary colony <b>organisms.</b> The primary colony <b>organisms</b> were slow-growing and cycloheximide-resistant {{as compared with the}} secondary ones which, like the parent <b>organisms,</b> were fast-growing in the absence of cycloheximide, but were inhibited when cycloheximide was incorporated in the medium. Cell aggregates, large swollen cells, and dwarf cells were found among the secondary colony <b>organisms.</b> The primary colony <b>organisms</b> were smaller than normal cells but were larger than the dwarf cells. The primary colony <b>organisms</b> also proved to have lost the faculty to sporulate, whereas the secondary colony <b>organisms</b> sporulated like the untreated parents. In contrast to the normal <b>organisms</b> and the secondary colony <b>organisms,</b> the primary colony <b>organisms</b> did not consume oxygen in manometric experiments with glucose as a substrate. On solid medium without cycloheximide, the latter <b>organisms</b> grew considerably better in a nitrogen atmosphere than in air...|$|R
50|$|After {{a natural}} disaster, common pioneer <b>organisms</b> include lichens and algae. Mosses usually follow lichens in colonization, but cannot serve as pioneer <b>organisms.</b> Pioneer <b>organisms</b> modify their {{environment}} and establish conditions that accommodate other <b>organisms.</b> In some circumstances, other <b>organisms</b> {{can be considered}} pioneer <b>organisms.</b> Birds are usually the first to inhabit newly created islands, and seeds, such as the coconut, {{may also be the}} first arrivals on barren soil.|$|R
50|$|The {{pathogen}} load in Stony Run is on {{the order}} of 6.842 × 1015 <b>organisms</b> per month. The largest contributor of pathogens is urban areas (6.738 × 1015 <b>organisms</b> per month). Farm animals contribute 1.034 × 1014 <b>organisms</b> per month, septic systems contribute 3.287 × 1011 <b>organisms</b> per month, and wildlife contributes 1.745 × 1011 <b>organisms</b> per month. The pathogen load could in the future be reduced by 1.16 percent to 6.762 × 1015 <b>organisms</b> per month.|$|R
5|$|Adaptation is the {{evolutionary}} process whereby an <b>organism</b> becomes {{better able to}} live in its habitat or habitats.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive mimicry is {{opposite}} {{in principle}} to defensive mimicry, where the mimic generally benefits from being treated as harmful. The mimic may resemble its own prey, or some other <b>organism</b> which is beneficial {{or at least not}} harmful to the prey. The model, i.e. the <b>organism</b> being 'imitated', may experience increased or reduced fitness, or may not be affected at all by the relationship. On the other hand, the signal receiver inevitably suffers from being tricked, {{as is the case in}} most mimicry complexes.|$|E
30|$|ENMs {{agglomerate}} in aquatic systems, {{and increased}} {{concentrations in the}} sediment are expected [31]. The standardised test <b>organisms</b> Chironomus riparius and Lumbriculus variegatus develop in the sediment. It cannot be excluded that <b>organisms</b> living and grazing on the sediment as well as floated submerged, aquatic macrophytes are exposed to a higher extent compared to the standard test <b>organisms</b> if spiking of the water phase is performed. It is recommended that the sensitivity of potential suitable <b>organisms</b> (sediment <b>organisms,</b> aquatic macrophytes) and of the standard test <b>organisms</b> (C.riparius, L. variegatus, Lemna minor) are compared {{to decide on the}} suitability of further test <b>organisms</b> and the potential replacement of traditionally applied <b>organisms</b> for the testing of ENMs.|$|R
50|$|The biota {{consists}} {{of a range of}} <b>organisms.</b> Free-swimming (nectonic) <b>organisms</b> are relatively rare, with the majority of <b>organisms</b> being bottom dwelling (benthic) — either moving about (vagrant) or permanently attached to the sea floor (sessile). About two-thirds of the Burgess Shale <b>organisms</b> lived by feeding on the organic content in the muddy sea floor, while almost a third filtered out fine particles from the water column. Under 10% of <b>organisms</b> were predators or scavengers, although since these <b>organisms</b> were larger, the biomass was split equally among each of the filter feeding, deposit feeding, predatory and scavenging <b>organisms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Consumers are <b>organisms</b> of an {{ecological}} food chain that receive energy by consuming other <b>organisms.</b> These <b>organisms</b> are formally {{referred to as}} heterotrophs, which include animals, some bacteria and fungi. Such <b>organisms</b> may consume by various means, including herbivory, predation, parasitization, and biodegradation.|$|R
5|$|For a {{parasitic}} <b>organism,</b> its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such <b>organism</b> is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is the modification of an organism's genome through biotechnology. Since the 1970s, {{a variety of}} techniques have been developed to specifically add, remove and edit genes in an <b>organism.</b> Recently developed genome engineering techniques use engineered nuclease enzymes to create targeted DNA repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the break is repaired. The related term synthetic biology is sometimes used to refer to extensive genetic engineering of an <b>organism.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2016 {{the first}} stable semisynthetic <b>organism</b> was created. It was a (single cell) {{bacterium}} with two synthetic bases (called X and Y). The bases survived cell division.|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of glycyl-L-leucine in a leucine auxotroph of Escherichia coli strain K- 12 {{was investigated}} {{with respect to}} the bacteriostatic effect of the peptide on growth, its hydrolysis by bacterial preparations, and its uptake by resting <b>organisms.</b> Growth inhibition by the peptide is relatively small if the <b>organisms</b> used as the inocula for the growth tests are taken from actively multiplying cultures (young <b>organisms),</b> but is marked if the inocula consist of <b>organisms</b> from cultures aged in an acid-producing, poorly buffered medium; ageing in a well-buffered or neutral medium does not produce peptide-sensitive <b>organisms.</b> Aged <b>organisms</b> that are very sensitive to the peptide readily take up the compound from the external medium, both in the absence and presence of chloramphenicol. Whole-cell preparations of these aged <b>organisms</b> do not effect the rapid hydrolysis of glycylleucine, but cell-free extracts have as much enzymic activity as cell-free extracts of young <b>organisms.</b> Whole-cell preparations of young <b>organisms</b> also have high enzymic activity. The available data suggest that the uptake of glycylleucine by young <b>organisms</b> is followed immediately by its hydrolysis, whereas the peptide taken up by aged (peptide-sensitive) <b>organisms</b> is hydrolysed only very slowly. The growth of inocula composed of <b>organisms</b> taken from yeast extract + peptone + agar slopes is markedly inhibited by glycylleucine. The hydrolytic activity of whole <b>organisms</b> taken from slopes is significantly less than that of young <b>organisms,</b> but disruption of slope-grown <b>organisms</b> to produce cell-free extracts does not lead to any significant increase in enzymic activity...|$|R

50|$|Negligible {{senescence}} is {{the lack}} of symptoms of aging in some <b>organisms.</b> Negligibly senescent <b>organisms</b> do not have measurable reductions in their reproductive capability with age, or measurable functional decline with age.

5|$|Many {{insects are}} {{considered}} pests by humans. Insects commonly regarded as pests include {{those that are}} parasitic (e.g. lice, bed bugs), transmit diseases (mosquitoes, flies), damage structures (termites), or destroy agricultural goods (locusts, weevils). Many entomologists are involved in various forms of pest control, as in research for companies to produce insecticides, but increasingly rely on methods of biological pest control, or biocontrol. Biocontrol uses one <b>organism</b> to reduce the population density of another <b>organism</b> — the pest — and is considered {{a key element of}} integrated pest management.|$|E
5|$|The Phengaris rebeli is a brood parasite, an <b>organism</b> that manipulates another <b>organism</b> (the host) {{to raise}} its offspring; in this case, the P. rebeli parasitizes a {{particular}} species of ant, the Myrmica schencki. The P. rebeli was first discovered to be a brood parasite when a researcher observed M. schencki ants bringing the P. rebeli larvae back to their own nest. One of the proposed hypotheses for this parasitism was that P. rebeli larvae released chemicals to confuse the ants into believing they were ant larvae.|$|E

5|$|The {{bacterium}} can {{be grown}} and cultured easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting, and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years. E. coli is a chemoheterotroph whose chemically defined medium must include a source of carbon and energy. E. coli is the most widely studied prokaryotic model <b>organism,</b> and an important species {{in the fields of}} biotechnology and microbiology, where it has served as the host <b>organism</b> for the majority of work with recombinant DNA. Under favorable conditions, it takes only 20 minutes to reproduce.|$|E
5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an <b>organism.</b> Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution to the next generation. However, fitness {{is not the same as}} the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes. For example, if an <b>organism</b> could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this <b>organism</b> would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.|$|E

40|$|Ecology is, in {{the most}} general terms, {{the study of the}} interrelationships between <b>organisms</b> and their environment. There are many {{branches}} of ecological study, but the basic definition of ecology emphasizes that all <b>organisms</b> and their environment are interrelated. <b>Organisms</b> are affected by their environment, the environment is affected by <b>organisms,</b> and both directly and indirectly <b>organisms</b> are affected by other <b>organisms.</b> Some <b>organisms</b> affect their environment passively, for example a tree provides shade and transpires water through its leaves which have a moderating effect on temperature and humidity. Other <b>organisms</b> modify their environment actively, like the groundhog who moderates the temperature and humidity of its environment by burrowing underground. Humans are <b>organisms</b> who have developed tools to change their environment in very profound ways, which has allowed us to colonize and even prosper under a very wide range of environmental conditions.

According to some estimates, over 1700 species comprising over 4000 <b>organisms</b> {{are responsible for}} biofouling. Biofouling is divided into microfouling — biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion — and macrofouling — attachment of larger <b>organisms.</b> Due to the distinct chemistry and biology that determine what prevents them from settling, <b>organisms</b> are also classified as hard- or soft-fouling types. Calcareous (hard) fouling <b>organisms</b> include barnacles, encrusting bryozoans, mollusks, polychaete and other tube worms, and zebra mussels.
