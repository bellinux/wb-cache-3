Recommended lengths are between 150 and 195 centimeters for adult skiers, {{depending}} on {{height and weight}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user.</b> Back country skis are typically heavier and wider than classic and skate skis; they often have metal edges for better grip on hard snow; and their greater sidecut helps to carve turns.|$|E
5|$|The SSD {{controller}} {{will use}} any free blocks on the SSD for garbage collection and wear leveling. The portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> capacity which is free from user data (either already TRIMed or never {{written in the}} first place) will look the same as over-provisioning space (until the user saves new data to the SSD). If the user saves data consuming {{only half of the}} total user capacity of the drive, the other half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> capacity will look like additional over-provisioning (as long as the TRIM command is supported in the system).|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} {{access method}} {{will depend on}} the skills and abilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user.</b> With direct selection a body part, pointer, adapted mouse, joystick, or eye tracking could be used, whereas switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection. Unlike direct selection (e.g., typing on a keyboard, touching a screen), users of Target Scanning can only make selections when the scanning indicator (or cursor) of the electronic device is on the desired choice. Those who are unable to point typically calibrate their eyes to use eye gaze as a way to point and blocking as a way to select desired words and phrases. The speed and pattern of scanning, as well as the way items are selected, are individualized to the physical, visual and cognitive capabilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user.</b>|$|E

5|$|There are {{multiple}} methods of accessing messages on devices: directly or indirectly, or using specialized access devices—although the specific access method {{will depend on}} the skills and abilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user.</b> SGD output is typically much slower than speech, although rate enhancement strategies can increase the user's rate of output, resulting in enhanced efficiency of communication.|$|E
5|$|Equivalent {{residual}} {{times can}} be derived for other inert gases. These calculations are done automatically in personal diving computers, based on the diver's recent diving history, which {{is the reason why}} personal diving computers should not be shared by divers, and why a diver should not switch computers without a sufficient surface interval (more than 24 hours in most cases, up to 4 days, depending on the tissue model and recent diving history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user).</b>|$|E
5|$|Prediction is a rate {{enhancement}} {{strategy in}} which the device attempts to predict the letter, word or phrase being written by the user. The user can then select the correct prediction without needing to write the full word. Word prediction software may determine the words predicted based on their frequency in language, association with other words, past choices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user,</b> or grammatical suitability.|$|E

Over 1500 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>users</b> live in Argentina, with sizable populations in Spain and Brazil. Over half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> registered <b>users</b> are either born in Galicia or children of Galicians.

30|$|We also {{assume that}} <b>the</b> {{probability}} distributions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CNRs <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>users</b> are perfectly known (however, a known joint CNR distribution is not required). In modern cellular standards like 1 × EVDO, HSDPA, and Mobile WiMAX [1], much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> information needed for obtaining precise probability distribution estimates is already available. To conduct adaptive coding and modulation, modern cellular networks have precise, real-time CNR estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>users.</b> These channel quality estimates {{can therefore be}} utilized to obtain estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> probability distributions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CNRs <b>of</b> each one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>users.</b> Such probability distribution estimates {{can be obtained from}} some hundred CNR estimates by using, e.g., order statistic filter banks [15]. To further improve <b>the</b> estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> probability distributions, we can adapt the estimation techniques to <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> terrain that <b>the</b> <b>users</b> operate in and to <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>users.</b> For example, for a channel with many reflectors, with no line-of-sight (LOS) component, and with a relatively high speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>users,</b> a Rayleigh channel model will give a good estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channel gain. When we have a LOS component, a Rice channel can be assumed.|$|R
5|$|Business design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of integrating design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / Anthropology (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics / Economics / Psychology (M/E/P) management paradigm. Since 2006, the term Business Design is trademarked by the Rotman School of Management; they define business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative way of thinking that {{is characterized by a}} deep understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user,</b> creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to problem solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business {{design management}} activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the Aalto University in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Fairley's {{proposed}} use of atebrin as a prophylactic {{agent was}} accepted and Fairley switched the Australian Army over to using atebrin as a prophylaxis instead of quinine in March 1943. The most acute problem {{at this time}} was a shortage of atebrin. The Australian Army had only seven weeks' stock was on hand in March 1943 and US forces in both the South West Pacific and South Pacific Area were drawing on Australian Army stocks as they had not yet received adequate stocks of their own. The drug is also a dye, and had the known side effect of making the skin and eyeballs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> go yellow in colour after repeated use but this was an acceptable drawback in wartime. Prolonged use could cause lichen planus and psychosis in rare cases, but atebrin still {{turned out to be}} much safer than quinine.

5|$|In July 2011, a {{high-quality}} {{recording of the}} Las Vegas show was uploaded to YouTube. On July 14, 2011, {{the vice president of}} Online Anti-Piracy from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Marc McDevitt, requested a subpoena at a federal court to obtain personal details from YouTube <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> who uploaded the video, including the IP address, e-mail address and any other relevant information to identify the person. Although it is common for major music labels to send takedown requests to YouTube, it is thought to be the first time the RIAA filed legal action against the video hosting site in order to obtain the personal details of an uploader. The case was closed after a week; according to a copyright lawyer, it is most likely that the subpoena was granted by the court and that YouTube agreed to hand over the personal details that were requested. The video was removed from YouTube, but copies of the full concert can still be found on the site.|$|E

Journalists have defended Valve in these claims, countering that the game's length depends {{on the amount of}} immersion the player puts into the game, that the downloadable content is only cosmetic additions for the co-op mode, and that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac version do not suggest a simple console port.|$|E
