40|$|<b>Oxametacin,</b> a new non steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} compound, with analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties {{comparable to}} those of indomethacin, has been claimed to be effective in treatment of acute attacks of gout. The present study comprises an investigation in 8 healthy volunteers of the effect on the endogenous uric acid clearance rate, of <b>oxametacin</b> administered alone or in combination with the conventional hypouricaemic agents benzbromarone or allopurinol. Whether given alone or in combination with these drugs, <b>oxametacin</b> failed to alter the clearance rate of endogenous uric acid. In view of its good tolerance and its possible efficacy in treatment of acute attacks of gout, the present data help to validate use of <b>oxametacin</b> in acute gout.

40|$|The current {{interest}} in hydroxamic and polyhydroxamic acids {{is related to}} the vari-ety of their biological activities, as well as to their role as iron chelators and microbial siderophores (13). Antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities of hydroxamic acids are connected with their ability to inhibit various enzymes, viz., matrix metalloproteinases (4, 5), 5 -lipoxygenase (6, 7), urease (8) or ribonucleotid reduc-tase (9). Some ion exchange resins are based on hydroxamic acids (10), and a number of hydroxamic acids are currently accepted therapeutic agents (desferrioxamine B, hydro-xycarbamide, ibuproxam, <b>oxametacin,</b> bufexamac, adrafinil) (11). The promising thera-peutic potential of this class of compounds prompted us to screen antimicrobial activity of several hydroxamic acids previously synthesized by our group (12). In this paper, we report the results of the undertaken antimicrobial evaluation. EXPERIMENTA...|$|E
