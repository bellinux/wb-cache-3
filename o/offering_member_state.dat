40|$|The {{introduction}} of Directive 2003 / 30 EC of the European Union (EU) on biofuels had the ambitious goal to both reduce {{greenhouse gas emission}} (GHG) and create new jobs in rural areas. The challenge lies in the availability of premises to convert biomass in energy, which depends {{on the availability of}} land. Thus an opportunity has been created on the EU market for biofuels, <b>offering</b> to each <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> with an excess of agricultural land, to benefit from both environmental and economic point of view. In this paper, the authors investigate whether it would be profitable for Bulgarian SMEs, operating in the agricultural sector, to shift into such a ‘green business’ and whether this shift could contribute in diversifying the role of agriculture by stimulating the development of new sources of income and by ensuring long-term competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|Labor {{market policy}} in the EU is {{seemingly}} a rather different animal today than heretofore because of the belated recognition that healthy employment development is the precondition for achieving fair and decent social and working standards. The pursuit of often ambitious mandatory labor standards {{appears to have been}} downplayed, and the notion of coordination to have superceded harmonization. The new means of coordination (via national employment plans) is benchmarking, identifying best-practice measures in employment policy, and <b>offering</b> encouragement to <b>member</b> <b>states</b> to progressively develop their own policies in this light. The presumed goal is to secure meaningful common action in the context of institutional diversity in national labor markets [...] the perennial problem in EU social policy formation. I review the new employment strategy with special reference to its education and training components and in the process question whether recent developments presage a sea change in the evolution of Community labor policy.

40|$|Theories of European {{integration}} {{suggest that}} supranational {{institutions of the}} European Union are the central and driving force behind European integration. These theories imply that <b>member</b> <b>states</b> will in practice comply with European Union legislation. Thus, compliance rates should be comparable across all <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> Contrary to this premise, however, data suggests that rates of compliance vary significantly between the <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> Although nearly all <b>member</b> <b>states</b> typically have {{a high level of}} compliance on an annual basis, there is still variation in compliance rates even among the less Eurosceptic <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> What explains the variations in compliance rates between <b>member</b> <b>states?</b> This thesis posits that the more veto players a <b>member</b> <b>state</b> contains; the less likely they are to comply with the European Union...|$|R

25|$|Each <b>Member</b> <b>State's</b> {{national}} VAT legislation {{must comply}} with the provisions of EU VAT law {{as set out in}} Directive 2006/112/EC. This Directive sets out the basic framework for EU VAT, but does allow <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> some degree of flexibility in implementation of VAT legislation. For example, different rates of VAT are allowed in different EU <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> However Directive 2006/112 requires <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> to have a minimum standard rate of VAT of 15% and one or two reduced rates not to be below 5%. Some <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> have a 0% VAT rate on certain supplies; these <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> would have agreed this as part of their EU Accession Treaty (for example, newspapers and certain magazines in Belgium). The highest rate currently in operation in the EU is 27% (Hungary), though <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> are free to set higher rates.

40|$|From the introduction]. My {{study will}} focus in {{particular}} on three claims {{made in the}} literature about <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. The first claim is that <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation was initially low and {{that much of the}} Court's constitutionalization of the Treaty occurred when <b>member</b> <b>states</b> were simply too inattentive to notice the magnitude of the Court's activity. The second claim is that early <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation reflected a concern to protect national laws, but that this pattern of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation is changing as <b>member</b> <b>state</b> evince more of a desire to influence the general trend of Commmunity law. The final claim tested is that, with the Single European Act's change to qualified majority voting in the Council, member states' attitudes of acceptance toward the Court will change, and criticism of the Court will increase. This hypothesis is {{based on the belief that}} the supranationalism of the ECJ was accepted because of the intergovernmentalism of the Council. The data on <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation suggests, however, that none of these claims provide an accurate picture of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. While there has been an increase in participation over time, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have shown a high degree of participation in Article 177 cases from the outset. Further, trends in <b>member</b> <b>states</b> participation do not provide adequate empirical proof of a change in <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation from self-interest to a Community interest. Finally, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> do not appear to have changed their behavior toward the Court since the passage of the Single European Act...|$|R

50|$|The {{principle}} of conferral is a fundamental {{principle of}} European Union law. According to this principle, the EU is a union of <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> and all its competences are voluntarily conferred on it by its <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> The EU has no competences by right, and thus any areas of policy not explicitly agreed in treaties by all <b>member</b> <b>states</b> remain {{the domain of the}} <b>member</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R
