40|$|Current European {{legislation}} {{calls for}} the abatement of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through better building design and technological solutions, {{in order to reduce}} <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use,</b> embodied energy and embodied material emissions originating from buildings. Presently, environmental performance assessment tools for buildings fall short of documenting all of these parameters. Comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) may be used to obtain a clear overview of mass and energy f lows in a building. However, construction professional consider LCA calculations as complex and time consuming. Therefore, this paper outlines a methodology {{for the development of a}} dynamic parametric analysis tool (PAT) for the comprehensive assessment of <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use,</b> embodied energy and embodied material emissions during the production and operation phases of a building. A simple, conceptual building case study is presented to demonstrate the potential use of this parametric analysis tool. The results show that the PAT developed in this study can be used to define optimal solutions of building envelopes for the different parameters of the analysis. In conclusion, this study facilitates the first steps of development and testing for a PAT that evaluate optimised solutions that minimise <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use,</b> embodied CO 2 eq emissions and embodied energy. The tool, which is not meant to give precise results, given its limitations in the calculation method, can be used for performing a comparative pre-assessment of various design solutions.

40|$|The {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} (LCA) method is a powerful tool that can serve to aid decision making regarding the environmental benefits of refurbishment projects. However, due to the relative complexity of LCA studies, simplified LCA methodologies are frequently used, focusing on {{just some of the}} building life cycle phases or a reduced number of indicators. The most common and widespread simplification is to only evaluate the differences a refurbishment project makes on the <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> of the building. This paper compares the results of applying full LCA, simplified LCA and <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> assessment in a refurbishment case study. Results show that simplified LCA methodologies including building use phase and product manufacturing phase can generally be sufficiently accurate to aid decision making for building energy refurbishment, as other building life cycle phases related to transport of products, on site construction, deconstruction or end of life represent a generally negligible part of the total life cycle impacts, both in terms of resource use or environmental impacts.

40|$|Taking the {{building}} sector’s {{huge impact on}} the environment into consideration, the European Union aims at ‘nearly zero-energy’ houses by 2021 through strict requirements for the (non-renewable) <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use.</b> Although it is not included in current calculation methods, the life cycle energy use of buildings is an aspect of growing interest, encompassing both the <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> throughout {{the building}} service life and the life cycle embodied energy and end-of-life energy in building materials. This contribution examines the life cycle energy use of a zero-energy case study house by means of a life cycle energy assessment and contains a parameter analysis of its different components, such as the building construction and building services. The results show that, during its entire lifecycle, a zero-energy house uses 2 to 4 times less non-renewable energy than a passive house with identical floor plan and 3 to 5 times less than a house built according to standard building practice in Belgium. Secondly, the embodied energy in a zero-energy house with a passive building envelope proves to be equal to that in a zero-energy house with a standard building envelope. Thus, passive house requirements are not considered an essential criterion for zero-energy houses from life cycle energy point of view. On the other hand, the study reveals that the choice of building construction materials and building services are determining factors for the life cycle energy use, resulting in energy savings up to 35 kWh/year/m² for zero-energy houses...|$|E

This paper presents a case study methodology for energy performance assessment of existing residential stock of Hamirpur {{that can be used}} to develop suitable energy efficiency regulations. The paper discusses the trend of residential development in Hamirpur followed by classification based on usage, condition, predominant material use, ownership size and number of rooms, source of lighting, assets available, number of storey and plot sizes using primary and secondary data. It results in identification of predominant materials used and other characteristics in each of urban and rural area.

Research {{in this area}} is steadily growing; however, {{there is a lack of}} conclusive results in available literature about energy performances related to the DSF, thus limiting a better and more informed application of this technology in the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector. This article systematically reviews more than 50 articles which have dealt with the energy related performance of DSFs in temperate climates and provides a meta-analysis of the numerical findings published in the studies examined. Energy related figures are presented separately for embodied and <b>operational</b> <b>energy.</b> Specifically, the <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> end <b>uses</b> taken into account are heating, cooling, lighting, and ventilation. Numerical results in the literature are normalised and expressed in form of percentage of maximum energy reduction/increment compared to a base case (e. g. a single skin case) used as a reference in the corresponding studies. Such an approach is meant to provide a reliable comparison of published figures. Key façade parameters (DSF spatial configurations, cavity width and ventilation), building parameters (orientation and climatic areas) and the methodological approaches used in the reviewed studies were adopted as clustering criteria. Several clustering criteria present extremely spread values, indicating the necessity to further investigate, understand, and attempt to reduce such high discrepancies in <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> performances.

In most heritage building projects (HBPs), the <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> aspects are less considered, and a systematic way of analyzing their energy performance following project delivery is often lacking. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the operational performance of refurbishment and reuse of UK listed church projects. The objective is to assess the <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> with a view to optimizing their sustainable performance. The methodology includes eight selected case study buildings refurbished and converted for multipurpose use. The case study approach provided qualitative insights into how the study contributes to a more structured requirements for energy management in HBPs with specific attention to energy-efficient building operations. The findings show the need to focus on fundamental areas of operational management (i. e. by developing and implementing more focused policy on operational energy performance of heritage buildings) to minimize the energy required to operate them. The challenges of implementing changes in operational energy performance improvement of heritage buildings are addressed in the form of recommendations that could lead to real results. The study concludes that leveraging these areas requires commitment from all heritage building stakeholders because they all have substantial roles in harmonizing the requirement for the project׳s sustainability and not just the building operators. Meanwhile, baseline project planning, periodic updating, monitoring, and managing the energy use pattern are suggested as measures that could greatly facilitate better energy performance to optimizing their sustainable reuse compared with the traditional approach of trying to improve their thermal performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} "clean energy city" has {{attained}} increased attention in recent year. However, almost all studies to date about "clean energy" are {{either at the}} building scale or the regional scale and little touches the real estate development scale, or in other words the neighborhood scale. The research project "Making the 'Clean Energy City' in China" - funded by Energy Foundation, China - is the first attempt to dress the relationship between neighborhood form and energy consumption. As part of the research, my thesis proposes the framework to address the energy-form relationship in in-home <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use,</b> to be further developed in the future stages of the research project. The thesis poses two questions, how does neighborhood form affect in-home operational energy consumption {{and how do we}} guide designers and developers on the design of neighborhood form in order to reduce in-home operational energy consumption? The thesis approaches these questions through a review of existing energy-related simulation tools including building energy analysis tools, microclimate analysis tools and tools that address energy concerns at the neighborhood scale. The thesis proposes to use a simulation approach based on prototypes and their variations at the cluster scale - a form descriptive system developed by the research project - as the direction to establish this form-energy relationship as well as to convey this relationship to designers graphically. Finally as a demo, the thesis examines the relationship between <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> and neighborhood form under Prototype "Small Perimeter Block" with DeST, a building simulation tool that can also be applied to a cluster of buildings. by Jue Wang.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} the embodied and <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> during construction and occupation phases of three main construction methods on social dwellings in Ecuador. The analysis focuses on current construction practices in the two largest Ecuadorian cities: Guayaquil and Quito, represent- ing typical coastal and highland climates of the country respectively. A model of a social interest dwelling that follows the guidelines of the Ecuadorian Housing Secretary is defined. Three different construction methods were considered: Isolated Concrete Forms (ICF), concrete Load Bearing Walls (LBW) and traditional beams-columns Confined Masonry (CM) systems. The assessment also includes two roofing alternatives: concrete slabs defined for each construction method (S a, S b, S c) and metallic alloy roofs (Z). The embodied energy assessment focuses on the materials required for each construction technique, and uses a craddle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> evaluation <b>uses</b> the cooling <b>energy</b> to reach comfort inside the dwelling by simulations with EnergyPlus. CM dwelling units using zinc-alloy roofs show the lowest embodied energy results (2. 0 GJ/m 2) while ICF structures using concrete slab have the highest (3. 2 GJ/m 2). In terms of <b>operational</b> <b>energy,</b> the lowest consumption corresponds to ICF units with slab roof (13. 6 GJ/m 2) while the largest are LBW units with zinc-alloy roofs (65. 2 GJ/m 2). Most of the energy consumed during the life cycle corresponds to <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> with a range between 81. 1 % and 97. 0 %. In conclusion, possible energy savings between 49 % and 69 % through the life cycle are identified by switching from a CM system to ICF system. Hence, these results have potential impact on housing and energy policy in Ecuador...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is  to {{demonstrate}} and critically assess life cycle approaches’ and environmental certification (EC) tools’ potential for supporting decisions for improved environmental performance in the building and real estate sectors. Using life cycle approaches, the thesis shows that for new build and renovation cases aiming for low <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> that embodied global warming potential (GWP) due to material production can constitute {{a large portion of}} a building’s lifetime GWP. Therefore life cycle based information about materials’ embodied GWP needs to be made available to and utilized by design process decision makers. It was also shown that applying the Swedish EC tool Miljöbyggnad was useful in highlighting potential positive and negative changes in indoor environmental quality arising from renovation packages aiming at significant <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> reduction in existing multifamily buildings. However such renovation packages are not profitable from a property owner perspective. Miljöbyggnad may be useful when designing policy instruments to overcome this.    The thesis also showed that EC and related environmental enhancements contribute to achieving property owners’ and tenants’ overall strategic objectives for value creation. For property owners this arises for example through lower energy costs and attracting desirable tenants. For tenants, value creation arises as support for internal and external environmental communication. For the further development of life cycle approaches’ and EC tools’ application to buildings and real estate {{it is important to consider}} how they can be adapted to consider ‘distance to sustainable’ targets referencing for instance the planetary boundaries approach. It is also interesting to investigate how valuation of buildings and real estate may be performed in a way that expands from the current narrow focus on the economic perspective to also include environmental and social perspectives.

40|$|In recent years, Information Technology (IT) {{has grown}} into a sector that is both as vital and, or {{possibly}} even more, resource consuming as Aviation. Combined with our ever-growing dependence of IT, the resulting energy costs as well as the inevitable depletion of materials, such as fossil fuels and rare earth materials, have driven the need for more sustainable solutions, both environmentally and economically. Consequently, the body of knowledge on IT Sustainability, or "Green IT", is steadily growing, which has mainly yielded solutions for making hardware less resource costly and possibly more energy efficient. However, software {{can be seen as the}} true consumer of energy. As the design of software greatly determines the specific utilization of hardware components, during operation, software architects have the potential to influence the sustainability of software. However, this potential is yet inaccessible due to the lack of architectural tactics that address sustainability, let alone proper metrics to determine and validate the energy consumption of software. Hence, this research attempts to develop metrics for the <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> of application software and, subsequently, apply them to determine relations between software design decisions, system workloads and impacts on the energy use of software products, independently of systems. To achieve our primary objective, we measured the power consumption of different computer systems during base, application and maximum workload intervals, while in the meantime we also recorded the performance of the systems. The performance data was used afterwards to determine whether a specific measurement was acceptably clean (e. g. minimal amount of noise). Then, after collecting a sufficient amount of clean measurements, we applied a subtractive method to filter out unrelated base power consumptions and determine the <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> of an application. Two applications were used in this research to develop the metrics. First, we performed initial experiments with a CPU-intensive stress test application, which has a relatively simple workload and power usage profile. After this, we further evaluated the metrics by performing a case-study with a document batch processing application, which has a more complex design and deployment. To improve the reliability of the measurements, we remotely operated and monitored the test systems and we performed multiple iterations, or "runs", per specific measurement to minimize the influence of noise. In addition, we considered different configurations, or "versions", of the test applications to enable the analysis of architectural decisions, such as single vs. dual-core processing. Based on our findings, we propose a set of metrics that can be used to determine more precisely which portion of the system's energy usage belongs to the execution of an application. Also, the metrics show that, although the total amount of energy which different systems require to execute an application may differ greatly, the <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> of the application can still be fairly similar. Lastly, it shows that multi-core processing might require more power, but also less energy...|$|E

This paper presents a new approach to model predictive control, where the above objectives can be addressed directly for the energy use and at least indirectly for the maintenance cost. In the predictive control formulation, we explicitly consider two terms: the first term is related to the energy consumption and the second term will address indirectly the maintenance cost through minimizing setpoint variations in order to provide smooth setpoint trajectories to the actuators. Thus eliminating the fluctuations in the setpoints lead to reduced fatigue of actuator components. Clearly this will lower the systematic maintenance cost significantly. This second term is actually a penalizing or regularization term which will shrink to zero the fluctuations in the setpoints. This proposed approach to model predictive control with this variations regularization term is demonstrated on a four zone building...|$|E

Emissions from a building can be divided in two categories. Emissions from the materials in the construction phase on one hand, and from <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> on the other hand. An important part of the emissions due to materials occur during the construction phase, whereas emissions related to operational energy occur little by little every year during operational years. But it is important to count emissions from materials during the operational years, which will occur when the building is maintained, repaired and refurbished. The frequency of replacing the various components is shown in the last chapter. It is also important to take into account end-of-life and waste handling of substituted products. Whether operational energy or embodied energy in materials contributes most to buildings emissions depends on the choice of materials and products, the choice and availability of energy supply and the energy performance of the building envelope. Local climate conditions and available local energy sources also play a very important part. A shift in focus from <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> to lifecycle energy use could help us make better design decisions for our buildings. If the aim is to reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the environmental impact over the lifecycle of a building, one could argue that it could be more efficient to use less and locally produced construction products, rather than having high weight and volume products being transported across the globe. By comparing LCA assessments and calculated energy need over the lifecycle we can optimize building design and hereby reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{definition}} of a zero energy building (ZEB) is a stand-alone building which does not use any offsite energy source for its operation. The definition is easily extended to buildings with a net-zero annual on-site energy balance, where a building {{is connected to the}} electricity grid and annual energy use is the same as energy exported to the grid. In this paper we expand the ZEB definition adding a life cycle perspective including the embodied energy (cradle to site) of materials, which is considered as an additional off-site supply. The consideration of embodied energy adds a level that will help discern the life cycle benefits of different demand or supply side building design strategies to achieve ZEBs. Calculations of <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> and embodied energy for different house design options are presented, analyzing what options would move closer to this ZEB definition. Results show how the achievement of extreme reductions on energy demand by using high quantities of energy intensive materials are not an optimum solution over the life cycle of a building, active technologies becoming a better option after certain limits...|$|E
40|$|Buildings consume around 40 % of {{the final}} energy in most {{countries}} but are also responsible for {{a large part of}} the <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> in the industrial and transport sectors. Today, most policies and market trends focus solely on the space heating and cooling demands often neglecting to consider indirect energy requirements such as the embodied energy of buildings or the transport energy of their users. This paper assesses different building scenarios located in two urban contexts by integrating the <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> demand as well as the embodied energy of the dwellings and the transport energy consumption of the users. Results show that space heating represents at most 23 % of the total life cycle energy demand over 50 years and 47 % if the rest of <b>operational</b> <b>energies,</b> i. e. domestic hot water and appliances, is considered. Transport consumes 34 - 51 % of the total life cycle energy consumption while the embodied energy of buildings was found to be of the same order of magnitude as their <b>operational</b> <b>energy.</b> Current energy assessment of buildings therefore often only analyses a small fraction of the total life cycle <b>energy</b> <b>use.</b> We should widen its scope to account for so-called indirect energy consumption. This paper shows that a more holistic approach to the assessment of the energy demand associated with buildings is necessary if significant improvements in their energy efficiency are to be achieved.

40|$|AbstractLife cycle energy {{analysis}} (LCEA) of eight residential buildings {{in and around}} Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, is undertaken in this study. <b>Energy</b> <b>used</b> in all three phases of construction, operation and demolition are considered. It is found that the main contribution to the <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> in residential buildings is from use of general appliance. The choice of building materials is shown to have significant effects on the embodied energy for the production, construction, maintenance and demolition phases. From this study, it is shown that the embodied energy may vary from 10 % to 30 %, while the <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> may vary from 65 % to 90 %. The demolition energy generally accounts for less than 4 % of life cycle energy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBuilding {{energy policy}} in many {{countries}} is firmly pointed towards a need for net zero energy homes. But given the limited range of <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> impacts that can be directly influenced by building regulations, and the wide variation in <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> behaviours of building users, what system performance levels {{will be required to}} ensure new homes achieve that standard? This paper utilises in-home energy monitoring from a near net zero energy estate to provide the evidence of the system performance needed for all major end-uses, for homes in warm temperate climates to achieve, on average, a net zero <b>operational</b> <b>energy</b> standard. The evidence presented in this paper points to the combination of passive solar design strategies, energy efficient appliances, and active solar systems that will lead to net zero energy performance given contemporary lifestyles and the impact of the digital age...|$|R
