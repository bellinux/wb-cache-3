5|$|In total 283 magical spells, {{also known}} as utterances, were carved and the signs painted blue <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the corridor, antechamber, and burial chamber of Unas' pyramid. They {{constitute}} the most complete rendition of the Pyramid Texts existing today. These spells were intended to help the king in overcoming hostile forces and powers in the Underworld and thus join with the sun god Ra, his divine father in the afterlife. By writing the texts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the pyramid internal chambers, the architects of Unas' pyramid ensured that the king would benefit from their potency even if the funerary cult was to cease.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} retiled in the 1980s, with murals {{designed}} by Allan Drummond that reference the British Museum. These murals reference Egyptian and Roman antiquities, with sarcophagi, statues and trompe-l'œil columns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the platform.|$|E

5|$|A granite wall {{surrounds}} the temple, enclosing all its shrines and six of its seven bodies of water. The rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, is unfinished. A swastika shaped temple tank built in 800 AD by Kamban Araiyan {{during the reign}} of Dantivarman is outside the temple complex. The Vijayanagar and Nayak kings commissioned paintings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the shrine of Pudarikakshan, some of which are still present.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare is well attested in sources {{contemporaneous}} {{with his}} reign. The tombs {{of many of}} his courtiers and family members have been discovered in Giza, Saqqara and Abusir. They give insights into the administrative reforms that Djedkare conducted during his reign and, in a few cases, even record letters that the king sent to his officials. These letters, inscribed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> tombs, typically present royal praises for the tomb owner.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Loring's bombers {{were placed}} on alert after Soviet {{submarines}} were spotted {{off the coast of}} the region. The base was briefly mentioned in the 1983 movie WarGames, although the film erroneously listed Loring as being home to the 43rd Bombardment Wing. In 1982, the base was hit by two earthquakes, which damaged the base hospital and caused cracks to appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the control tower.|$|E

5|$|Queen Zenobia Addressing her Soldiers by Giambattista Tiepolo; it {{dates to}} the early eighteenth century but the exact year is not known. This {{painting}} (part {{of a series of}} tableaux of Zenobia) was painted by Tiepolo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the Zenobio family palace in Venice, although they were unrelated to the queen.|$|E
5|$|The climate, {{and as a}} result, {{the flora}} and fauna, of Pinkham Notch varies greatly with elevation. As {{elevations}} increase <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the notch, climate and ecosystems change to those of increasingly northern occurrence. Biomes range from a low-elevation northern hardwood forest {{at the base of}} Mount Washington to alpine-Arctic vegetation near the summit comparable to vegetation found at the latitude of Labrador.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of the Sirex {{woodwasp}} {{are almost}} colourless and only have three stub-shaped pairs of sterna. They cut through host wood with their powerful mandibles. They have a pointed, dark tip at their rear end, which presses the drilling dust <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the borehole. They closely resemble other larvae in the genus Sirex.|$|E

An indoor waterfall surrounded by imitation exotic vegetation stood in the back. The club's main showroom, the Vermilion Room, often featured the likes of Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and the slapstick comedy duo of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} author Irvine Welsh, {{particularly}} Trainspotting, contain several references to Hibernian. The team is often mentioned in casual conversation {{and is the}} team many of his characters support. Visual references to Hibs are noticeable in Danny Boyle's film adaptation of Trainspotting; Begbie wears a Hibs shirt while he plays five-a-side football, while many Hibs posters and pictures can be seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> Mark Renton's bedroom.|$|E

5|$|Although Warren {{departed}} soon afterwards leaving just a frigate squadron behind, {{the siege}} continued throughout August. French forces dominated Elba but {{were unable to}} make an impression <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the fortress while Royal Navy forces controlled access to the island by sea, providing supplies for the defenders and denying them to the French. Halsted and Phoenix maintained a blockade of the port of Piombino on the Italian mainland, ensuring the interception of French supplies.|$|E
5|$|Although Warren {{departed}} {{the region}} soon afterwards {{with most of}} his squadron, Watrin was still unable to make an impression <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> Porto Ferrajo, and Airey held the town against the French {{for the last few}} weeks of the war until news arrived of the ceasefire that accompanied the provisional signing of the Treaty of Amiens on 1 October. On 11 October, volunteers from the Maltese Light Infantry arrived to relieve the garrison at Porto Ferrajo. In March 1802 under Article XI of the final terms of the Treaty, the British turned over the entire island to the French and Elba remained in French hands throughout the Napoleonic Wars. The Maltese detachment returned to Malta in April 1802.|$|E
5|$|Dilys Cadwaladr, {{the former}} school teacher on Bardsey Island, in 1953 {{became the first}} woman to win the Crown at the National Eisteddfod for her long poem Y Llen; and artist Brenda Chamberlain twice won the Gold Medal for Art at the Eisteddfod; some of the murals she painted can still be seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> Carreg, her island home from 1947 to 1962. Wildlife artist Kim Atkinson, whose work has been widely {{exhibited}} in Wales and England, spent her childhood on the island and returned to live there in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, Walter Alvarez {{was doing}} {{geologic}} research in central Italy. There he had located an outcrop <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> a gorge whose limestone layers included strata both {{above and below}} the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Exactly at the boundary is a thin layer of clay. Walter told his father that the layer marked where the dinosaurs and much else became extinct and that nobody knew why, or what the clay was about — it was a big mystery and he intended to solve it.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} during the first months of 2006. The main hurdle came up with the location. Barjatya wanted to shoot film in an {{authentic}} way. He asked the film's art director Sanjay Dhobade to create the entire town of Madhupur that can give a realistic look, particularly portions where water leaking takes place and portions where spit marks were visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the buildings in the film. Later, the town was created in film city, Mumbai. Outdoor session of the film was done in Delhi, Lonavla, Ranikhet, Nainital and Almora.|$|E
5|$|Gills are adnate with a decurrent tooth (where {{the gills}} curve up {{to join the}} stipe but then, close to the stipe, the margin turns down again), and {{initially}} narrow but broaden when old. They are pallid to grayish-olive with bright orange edges. Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens, because the pigment, rather than being encrusted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the cystidia, {{is found in the}} cytosol and therefore more readily diffusible. The gills are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe, and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stipe).|$|E
