5|$|Risk factors {{indicating}} {{an increased}} risk of death include older age, female gender, a history of liver cirrhosis, biliary narrowing due to cancer, acute renal failure and the presence of liver abscesses. Complications following severe cholangitis include renal failure, respiratory failure (inability of the respiratory system to <b>oxygenate</b> blood and/or eliminate carbon dioxide), cardiac arrhythmia, wound infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial ischemia (lack of blood flow to the heart, leading to heart attacks).|$|E
5|$|James Spotila et al. (1991) {{concludes that}} the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to {{maintain}} high metabolic rates because {{they would not have}} been able to release enough heat. They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to <b>oxygenate</b> the brain. Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated.|$|E
40|$|The {{combustion}} of <b>oxygenated</b> fuel {{produces more}} non-regulated pollutants which usually contain oxygen such as aldehydes than the combustion of hydrocarbon fuel. The formation of these <b>oxygenated</b> intermediates {{may be associated}} with the release of oxygen from the <b>oxygenated</b> fuel. In this paper, migration pathways of oxygen from several <b>oxygenated</b> fuels were investigated to obtain the formation characteristics of <b>oxygenated</b> intermediates. Major <b>oxygenated</b> intermediates and other intermediates were identified using synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry in a dimethyl ether flame, an ethanol flame, and a propane flame. Their mole fractions were also evaluated. The results indicate that the oxygen from <b>oxygenated</b> fuel leads to an easier production of <b>oxygenated</b> intermediates, compared with oxygen from the oxidizer. The major <b>oxygenated</b> intermediate depends on the structure of the <b>oxygenated</b> fuel and was found to be formaldehyde in the dimethyl ether flame, and acetaldehyde in the ethanol flame. However, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are present in low concentrations while hydrocarbon intermediates, such as ethene, ethyne, and propene, are present in high concentrations in the propane flame...|$|R
30|$|In general, <b>oxygenated</b> {{hemoglobin}} gives {{oxygen to}} {{each part of}} the body including the muscles and then changes into deoxygenated hemoglobin. The deoxygenated hemoglobin obtains oxygen from the lungs and then changes into <b>oxygenated</b> hemoglobin. Note that the total amount of <b>oxygenated</b> hemoglobin[*]+[*]deoxygenated hemoglobin in the whole body should be the constant because the blood flow is constant. If the muscle is used, the oxygen is consumed there, and more oxygen is demanded. As a result, <b>oxygenated</b> hemoglobin is provided to the oxygen-consumed area, the ratio of <b>oxygenated</b> hemoglobin increases and deoxygenated hemoglobin decreases. Thus we may say that by observing <b>oxygenated</b> hemoglobin and deoxygenated one, muscle fatigue can be estimated.|$|R
40|$|Aim To examine those claims, i. e {{the effects}} of <b>oxygenated</b> water on {{hypertension}} and Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Methods In this clinical trial, 108 subjects of Diabetes Mellitus were recruited. Each group was divided randomly into 2 subgroups. One subgroup was given <b>oxygenated</b> water and the other subgroup was given non-oxygenated water for 2 period of intervention, 45 days and 90 days. Measured variables were, blood sugar and malondialdehyde (MDA). Results The study showed that <b>oxygenated</b> water could reduce post-prandial glucose in DM subjects. DM subjects with normal nutritional states, also had greater tendency of MDA reduction after consuming <b>oxygenated</b> water for 45 days.

25|$|<b>Oxygenate</b> {{blending}} adds oxygen-bearing compounds such as MTBE, ETBE, ethanol, and biobutanol. The {{presence of}} these oxygenates reduces {{the amount of carbon}} monoxide and unburned fuel in the exhaust gas. In many areas throughout the US, <b>oxygenate</b> blending is mandated by EPA regulations to reduce smog and other airborne pollutants. For example, in Southern California, fuel must contain 2% oxygen by weight, resulting in a mixture of 5.6% ethanol in gasoline. The resulting fuel is often known as reformulated gasoline (RFG) or oxygenated gasoline, {{or in the case of}} California, California reformulated gasoline. The federal requirement that RFG contain oxygen was dropped on 6 May 2006 because the industry had developed VOC-controlled RFG that did not need additional oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Plans to artificially <b>oxygenate</b> {{areas of}} the Baltic that have {{experienced}} eutrophication have been proposed by the University of Gothenburg and Inocean AB. The proposal intends to use wind-driven pumps to inject oxygen (air) into waters at, or around, 130m below sea level.|$|E

50|$|<b>Oxygenated</b> {{chemical}} compounds contain oxygen {{as a part}} of their chemical structure. The term usually refers to <b>oxygenated</b> fuels. <b>Oxygenates</b> are usually employed as gasoline additives to reduce carbon monoxide and soot that is created during the burning of the fuel.

25|$|The European Fuel Oxygenates Association (EFOA) credits methyl Ttertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl ter-butyl ether (ETBE) as {{the most}} {{commonly}} used ethers in fuel to replace lead. Ethers were introduced in Europe in the 1970s to replace the highly toxic compound. Although Europeans still use bio-ether additives, the US no longer has an <b>oxygenate</b> requirement therefore bio-ethers are no longer used as the main fuel additive.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{water spider}} spins four main kinds of silk: (1) silk {{used for the}} diving bell, (2) silk to anchor the diving bell to water plants, (3) silk for “walking” so as to get prey and mate, and (4) silk for the egg-cocoon. The diving bell silk is “used for breathing,” that is it serves to <b>oxygenate</b> the diving bell. Females produce larger diving bells than males. Males build their diving bells less {{carefully}} than females do. Males also frequently make more walking threads than females.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of diving {{barotrauma}} {{depends on}} the symptoms. Lung over-pressure injury may require a chest drain to remove air from the pleura or mediastinum. Recompression with hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the definitive treatment for arterial gas embolism, as the raised pressure reduces bubble size, low inert gas partial pressure accelerates inert gas solution and high oxygen partial pressure helps <b>oxygenate</b> tissues compromised by the emboli. Care must be taken when recompressing to avoid a tension pneumothorax. Barotraumas that do not involve gas in the tissues are generally treated according to severity and symptoms for similar trauma from other causes.|$|E
40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study the impact of soil application of peptone and <b>oxygenated</b> peptone on organically grown chickpea (Cicer arietinum L. cv. Vijay). Both the treatments resulted in early flowering and early harvestation, increased number of pods/plant as well as fresh wt. and dry wt. of 100 pods and 100 seeds, with  <b>oxygenated</b> peptone showing comparatively higher level. The crop yield was more under <b>oxygenated</b> peptone treatment than under peptone treatment condition. The seeds of peptone treatment showed upper hand as compared to <b>oxygenated</b> peptone in acidity, DNA content and IAA oxidase activity. On the other hand, soil application of <b>oxygenated</b> peptone led to more enhancements in biochemical constituents of seed like total solids, ash, moisture content, crude fiber content, soluble proteins, total carbohydrates, polyphenols, proline, total free amino acids, ascorbic acid and RNA content. This indicates better nutritional quality of seeds. The enzyme activity of catalase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase showed upper hand under <b>oxygenated</b> peptone treatment. The overall picture shows that both peptone and <b>oxygenated</b> peptone were useful for the qualitative and quantitative enhancement in the yield of chickpea under organic farming condition.   <b>Oxygenated</b> peptone is more useful in this respect...|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} chemical kinetic modeling {{approach is}} {{used to examine the}} phenomenon of suppression of sooting in diesel engines by addition of <b>oxygenated</b> hydrocarbon species to the fuel. This suppression, which has been observed experimentally for a few years, is explained kinetically as a reduction in concentrations of soot precursors present in the hot products of a fuel-rich diesel ignition zone when <b>oxygenates</b> are included. <b>Oxygenates</b> decrease the overall equivalence ratio of the igniting mixture, producing higher ignition temperatures and more radical species to consume more soot precursor species, leading to lower soot production. The kinetic model is also used to show how different <b>oxygenates,</b> ester structures in particular, can have different soot-suppression efficiencies due to differences in molecular structure of the <b>oxygenated</b> species...|$|R
25|$|Pulsed laser {{deposition}} (PLD) is {{a physical}} vapor deposition (PVD) technique where a high-power pulsed laser beam is focused inside a vacuum chamber to strike a target of the material {{that is to be}} deposited. This material is vaporized from the target (in a plasma plume) which deposits it as a thin film on a substrate (such as a silicon wafer facing the target). This process can occur in ultra high vacuum or {{in the presence of a}} background gas, such as oxygen which is commonly used when depositing oxides to fully <b>oxygenate</b> the deposited films.|$|E
25|$|Full acclimatization, however, {{requires}} days or even weeks. Gradually, {{the body}} compensates for the respiratory alkalosis by renal excretion of bicarbonate, allowing adequate respiration to provide oxygen without risking alkalosis. It takes about four days {{at any given}} altitude and can be enhanced by drugs such as acetazolamide. Eventually, the body undergoes physiological changes such as lower lactate production (because reduced glucose breakdown decreases the amount of lactate formed), decreased plasma volume, increased hematocrit (polycythemia), increased RBC mass, a higher concentration of capillaries in skeletal muscle tissue, increased myoglobin, increased mitochondria, increased aerobic enzyme concentration, increase in 2,3-BPG, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Pulmonary artery pressure increases {{in an effort to}} <b>oxygenate</b> more blood.|$|E
25|$|In the hospital, {{the blood}} {{pressure}} can be artificially increased {{in order to increase}} CPP, increase perfusion, <b>oxygenate</b> tissues, remove wastes, and thereby lessen swelling. Since hypertension is the body's way of forcing blood into the brain, medical professionals do not normally interfere with it when it is found in a patient with a head injury. When it is necessary to decrease cerebral blood flow, MAP can be lowered using common antihypertensive agents such as calcium channel blockers. If there is an intact blood–brain barrier, osmotherapy may be carried out by administering IV mannitol to create a hypertonic solution within the blood to draw water out of the neurons. This helps to reduce the fluid within the intracranial space; however, prolonged administration may lead to increase in ICP.|$|E
40|$|The <b>oxygenating</b> {{component}} of 2, 5 -diketocamphane 1, 2 -monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17453 was purified to homogeneity {{by a combination}} of ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and polyanion SI- 17 columns. It had an Mr of 78, 000, bound one molecule of nonautooxidizable flavin mononucleotide (FMN), consisted of two subunits of equal molecular weight, and existed in two electrophoretically distinguishable active forms. The <b>oxygenating</b> complex was constructed from equimolecular amounts of an NADH oxidase, which could be purified separately (Mr, 36, 000), and the <b>oxygenating</b> component. Most of the NADH oxidase dissociated from the <b>oxygenating</b> component during purification, although traces remained, to give the final preparation of the <b>oxygenating</b> component significant oxygenase activity. FMN did not dissociate significantly from the <b>oxygenating</b> component during purification, but it was not covalently bound and could be removed under a variety of conditions. Binding between the two proteins that made up the active complex was fairly weak and freely reversible. It probably occurred through the FMN which was strongly bound to the <b>oxygenating</b> component and for which the NADH had a weak binding site. Iron was not present at a significant level in the <b>oxygenating</b> component, and in common with other characterized Baeyer Villiger monooxygenases, 2, 5 -diketocamphane 1, 2 -monooxygenase was found to be a simple flavoprotein...|$|R

25|$|The {{demand for}} ethanol fuel {{produced}} from field corn was spurred in the U.S. {{by the discovery}} that methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) was contaminating groundwater. MTBE use as an <b>oxygenate</b> additive was widespread due to mandates of the Clean Air Act amendments of 1992 to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. As a result, by 2006 MTBE use in gasoline was banned in almost 20 states. There was also concern that widespread and costly litigation might be taken against the U.S. gasoline suppliers, and a 2005 decision refusing legal protection for MTBE, opened a new market for ethanol fuel, the primary substitute for MTBE. At a time when corn prices were around US$2 a bushel, corn growers recognized the potential of this new market and delivered accordingly. This demand shift took place {{at a time when}} oil prices were already significantly rising.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{eutrophication}} initiates top-down control via {{the impact}} of snow geese on the arctic marshes of Hudson Bay (Jefferies 1997). By the 1980s, the snow geese that originally annually migrated to Hudson Bay had switched from feeding in temperate wetlands to feeding in heavily fertilized agricultural fields. Over a period of 30 years, the geese population exploded. Snow geese have since utterly destroyed {{hundreds of thousands of}} acres of the Hudson Bay wetland. The geese grubbed marsh plant roots, evaporation increased leading to subsequent salinity increase, and without plants to <b>oxygenate</b> the soil the substrate became anoxic. This undesirable environment for marsh plants disallows sexual recruitment to the area. Snow geese have denuded the marsh until recolonization by clonal runners can restore marsh vegetation, which could take years. Because of the use of artificial fertilizers on temperate zone agricultural fields, a trophic cascade was initiated (Jefferies 1997).|$|E
25|$|The river below Clayton West {{ceases to}} be a shallow, fast-flowing watercourse, and {{consists}} of deeper pools with a slower flow, which is suitable for various coarse fish as well as trout. By 1974, a modest improvement in water quality had been achieved by treatment of industrial effluent, and some fish managed to exist below the weir at the Star Paper Mill in Barnsley. The weir helped to <b>oxygenate</b> the water, {{and most of the}} fish had been washed downstream from Cannon Hall and Bretton Lakes. During flood conditions, many of the population would be washed further downstream, to be replaced by others from the lakes. A survey in 1982 found gudgeon, minnow and three-spined stickleback, which had increased by 1985, and over 10,000 coarse fish were released as part of a restocking programme. However, most of these were killed by serious pollution incidents that affected the river in 1987 and 1988, and incidents continued for a further three years. The sewage treatment works at Darton and Lundwood, on either side of Barnsley, were largely responsible.|$|E

40|$|<b>Oxygenated</b> {{water is}} water with {{increased}} concentration of physically dissolved oxygen, and can perform {{all the same}} functions as the oxygen absorbed through the lungs. Several structures of human organs participate in the absorption and transportation of the oxygen, including the villi and cells containing mitochondrion in the small intestine {{as well as the}} lymph system. The aim of this in vivo study were three folds, to validate the support of <b>oxygenated</b> water on viability of probiotic bacteria in the GUT, to suppress the fecal coliform, and to study the effect of oxygen concentration on the profile of fecal microbiota. There were one control group and three probiotic groups of 5 rats each based on strain of probiotic supplementation, control without probiotic (a 0), Lactobacillus casei commercial strain (a 1), Lactobacillus sp. IS- 7257 (a 2) and Lactobacillus sp. IS- 27560 (a 3). Each group was treated with three variable treatments, without <b>oxygenated</b> water supplementation (b 0), supplemented with <b>oxygenated</b> water at 50 ppm (b 1), and at 80 ppm (b 2). Fecal samples were collected before (c 0), after 3 days (c 1), 7 days (c 2) supplementation, followed by 3 days after returning back to normal diet (c 3), analysed by culture dependent analyses for viable fecal lactic, coliform and fecal anaerobic bacteria. Supplementation of <b>oxygenated</b> water at 50 ppm, significantly increase fecal lactic acid bacteria of all probiotic groups after 3 and 7 days (P< 0. 05); 80 ppm <b>oxygenated</b> water tends to lower the fecal coliform (P< 0. 1), while <b>oxygenated</b> water administration gives no effect on fecal anaerobic bacteria. As a conclusion, 50 ppm <b>oxygenated</b> water administration significantly increased viable fecal lactic acid bacteria in probiotic groups.

25|$|Oxygen {{consumption}} (VO2) {{during exercise}} is best {{described by the}} Fick Equation: VO2=Q x (a-vO2diff), which states {{that the amount of}} oxygen consumed is equal to cardiac output (Q) multiplied by the difference between arterial and venous oxygen concentrations. More simply put, oxygen consumption is dictated by the quantity of blood distributed by the heart as well as the working muscle's ability to take up the oxygen within that blood; however, this is a bit of an oversimplification. Although cardiac output is thought to be the limiting factor of this relationship in healthy individuals, {{it is not the only}} determinant of VO2 max. That is, factors such as the ability of the lung to <b>oxygenate</b> the blood must also be considered. Various pathologies and anomalies cause conditions such as diffusion limitation, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and pulmonary shunts that can limit oxygenation of the blood and therefore oxygen distribution. In addition, the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood is also an important determinant of the equation. Oxygen carrying capacity is often the target of exercise (ergogenic aids) aids used in endurance sports to increase the volume percentage of red blood cells (hematocrit), such as through blood doping or the use of erythropoietin (EPO). Furthermore, peripheral oxygen uptake is reliant on a rerouting of blood flow from relatively inactive viscera to the working skeletal muscles, and within the skeletal muscle, capillary to muscle fiber ratio influences oxygen extraction.|$|E

500|$|Pulmonary {{contusion}} or its complications such as {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome {{may cause}} lungs to lose compliance (stiffen), so higher pressures {{may be needed to}} give normal amounts of air and <b>oxygenate</b> the blood adequately.

Twenty-four dogs underwent 90 min of coronary occlusion followed by 210 min of reperfusion and were randomized to either: 1) blood-free reperfusion with intracoronary <b>oxygenated</b> perfluorochemical (20 ml/kg per min) for 20 min followed by blood reperfusion (n = 8); 2) intracoronary unoxygenated perfluorochemical administered as in those treated with <b>oxygenated</b> perfluorochemical (n = 8); and 3) blood reperfusion alone (control) (n = 8). Regional myocardial blood flow was serially determined and global myocardial perfusion was assessed by an intravenous injection of the fluorescent dye (thioflavin-S). Quantitative studies were performed to determine neutrophil infiltration and extent of endothelial injury. Hemodynamic variables were similar in all groups. The zone of impaired perfusion (thioflavin negative), expressed as a percent of the left ventricle, averaged 10 ± 2 %, 6 ± 2 % and 3 ± 1 %, in control and unoxygenated and <b>oxygenated</b> perfluorochemical groups, respectively (control versus <b>oxygenated</b> perfluorochemical p < 0. 004). The reduction in thioflavin-negative area with <b>oxygenated</b> perfluorochemical was associated with a notable recovery of endocardial blood flow (0. 97 ± 0. 22 vs. control 0. 39 ± 0. 08 ml/min per g; p < 0. 04) at 210 min of reperfusion. The number of capillaries plugged by neutrophils (per 200 capillaries) in thioflavin-negative areas was similar with both <b>oxygenated</b> (5. 9 ± 1. 4) and unoxygenated perfluorochemical (5. 4 ± 0. 8) treatment and was significantly less than that with the control group (18. 9 ± 3. 2, p < 0. 003). Myocardium reperfused with <b>oxygenated</b> perfluorochemical demonstrated significantly greater preservation of endothelial structure.
