A requirement for a larger firebox version of the class ended up creating a whole new locomotive with the birth of the 4-6-2 wheel arrangement, the Pacific was born.

50|$|The {{appropriate}} form of Maxwell's equations {{is typically}} solved {{by one of}} two classesof methods. The first uses a differential form of the governing equations and requires thediscretization (meshing) of the entire domain in which the electromagnetic fields reside.Two {{of the most common}} approaches in this first class are the finite difference (FD) andfinite element (FEM) method. The resultant linear algebraic system (matrix) that mustbe solved is large but sparse (contains very few non-zero entries). Sparse linear solutionmethods, such as sparse factorization, conjugate-gradient, or multigrid methods can beused to solve these systems, the best of which require CPU time and memory of <b>O(N)time,</b> where N is the number of elements in the discretization.

NZR were generally happy with their Baldwin fleet. A private Railway operating in New Zealand at the time exclusively purchased Baldwin products after facing the same difficulties with British builders the NZR had. The Wellington and Manawatu Railway (1881-1909) operated small fleets of 2-8-0(4), 2-6-2(6), 2-8-2(1), 4-6-0(2) and a large 2-8-4(1) tank locomotive. When the NZR took over the railway, its fleet was absorbed into sub-classes of those operating already in the main fleet. When NZR placed tenders for Diesel locomotives in the 1950s, Baldwins applied but failed when EMD won the contract instead. Surprisingly only one NZR Baldwin product is operational, a class Wd 2-6-4 tank locomotive operating at the Ferrymead railway in Christchurch, the remains of a WMR 2-6-2 N, NZR 4-6-0 Ub, and two NZR 2-6-2 Wb tank locomotives are in the early stages of restoration.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2006. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: <b>OnTime</b> is a {{passenger}} transport {{company that was}} established in 1999 when the insurance giant Sanlam decided to outsource its transport services for its top officials. This document examines the challenges that <b>OnTime</b> faces as it seeks to grow its market by acquiring business from more corporates in order to lessen its dependence on Sanlam. The chauffeur industry in Cape Town is characterised {{by a lack of}} regulation and, as a result, there is no official data {{that can be used to}} describe the size of the industry. The lack of regulation means competition among industry players favours the two big companies to the detriment of the smaller ones. Smaller companies are constantly experiencing dwindling profits because of the dominance of these two big companies. At the other extreme, there are many pirate operators who compete on price by undercutting everyone else. The industry as a whole is experiencing growth due to the increasing number of corporations and government departments which have outsourced their passenger transport services for their top officials. While this move to outsource the passenger transportation is supposed to create new opportunities for small companies to benefit from the new business being generated, it appears that the smaller passenger transport companies have not yet benefited from this extra business. The main reason is that smaller passenger companies have been created without adequate support systems or a steady client base to sustain them through their early growth phase. On the flip side, the two big passenger transport compames are experiencing increasing volumes of business from those very same big corporations which were supposed to be the lifeblood of smaller passenger transport firms. The main reason for the phenomenal business growth for the two passenger transport companies is the fact that they belong to groups of companies which are constantly growing through the acquisition of other companies. The passenger transport unit then provides the transport needs of the entire group. Moreover, these two big passenger transport service providers have fonned alliances with most of the major airlines, hotels, and guest houses in order to be in a position to capture any business that flows from these airlines and hospitality service providers. In an industry where customers are conscious of the type of vehicles they are driven in, it is not surprising that the two big passenger transport companies are able to offer a variety of vehicles from which customers can choose. This is in sharp contrast to the small passenger transport companies whose fleet size limits the options they can offer their customers when it comes to choosing the type of vehicles they would like to be driven in. The findings contained in this document will influence the recommendations for formulating a business strategy for <b>OnTime.</b> The main challenge for <b>OnTime</b> is to grow its business by implementing drastic changes...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Approximately 15 {{million people}} suffer a stroke annually, up to 40 % {{of which may}} develop spasticity, which can result in {{impaired}} limb function, pain and associated involuntary movements affecting motor control. Robust clinical data on spasticity progression, associated symptoms development and functional impairment is scarce. Additionally, maximal duration of muscle tone reduction following botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injections remains undetermined. The <b>ONTIME</b> pilot study aims to explore these issues and evaluate whether abobotulinumtoxinA 500  U (Dysport®; Ipsen) administered intramuscularly within 12 weeks following stroke delays the appearance or progression of symptomatic (disabling) upper limb spasticity (ULS). Methods: <b>ONTIME</b> is a 28 -week, phase 4, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, exploratory pilot study initiated at four centres across Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Subjects (n =  42) with moderate to severe ULS (modified Ashworth scale [MAS] score ≥ 2) in elbow flexors or pronators, wrist flexors, or finger flexors will be recruited. Subjects will be randomised 2 : 1 to abobotulinumtoxinA 500  U or placebo (single dose 2 – 12 weeks after first-ever stroke). Primary efficacy will be measured by time between initial injection and visit at which reinjection criteria (MAS score ≥ 2 in the primary targeted muscle group and appearance or reappearance of symptomatic ULS) are met. Follow-up visits will be 4 -weekly {{to a maximum of}} 28 weeks. Discussion: This pilot study will facilitate the design and sample size calculation of further confirmatory studies, and is expected to provide insights into the optimal management of post-stroke patients, including timing of BoNT-A therapy and follow-up duration...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPerceived {{speed was}} {{measured}} for stimuli moving unidirectionally in apparent motion with different sampling steps. The stimuli were displayed at successive locations for very brief durations (on-time = 1 msec). The basic {{result is an}} elevation of apparent speed produced by increasing the sampling step. This speed-up effect is maximal at low speeds (2 deg/sec), then progressively decreases with higher speeds until it disappears at medium velocities (8 deg/sec). In addition, the speed-up observed at low speeds declines when the <b>ontime</b> is gradually increased from 1 msec to larger values, the largest one corresponding to “staircase motion”. These {{results are consistent with}} models assuming that speed-encoding is based on an antagonistic comparison of the activity in two broadly tuned temporal filters (low-pass and band-pass). The high temporal frequencies introduced by motion-sampling would activate the band-pass filter relatively more and would thus produce an overestimation of apparent speed...|$|E
