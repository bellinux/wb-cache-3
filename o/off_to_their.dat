On March 27, 2015, the Raptors clinched the Atlantic division title with a 94–83 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. This was the second consecutive year that the Raptors clinched the Atlantic Division title. On April 11, 2015, the Raptors beat the Miami Heat, Toronto's first road win over the Heat since November 19, 2008, ending a ten-game slide on Miami's home floor. The win was Toronto's 48th of the season and 22nd on the road, both tying franchise records. Four days later, the Raptors broke their franchise record with their 49th win of the season. After the 2014–15 season, Louis Williams won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award, becoming the first Raptor to do so. The Raptors faced the Washington Wizards {{in the first round of}} the 2015 playoffs, and lost four straight games as the Wizards swept the Raptors.|$|E

25|$|From {{the early}} to mid-1830s (and {{particularly}} through the epoch years, 1846–69) the Oregon Trail and its many offshoots were used by about 400,000 settlers, farmers, miners, ranchers, and business owners and their families. The {{eastern half of the}} trail was also used by travelers on the California Trail (from 1843), Mormon Trail (from 1847), and Bozeman Trail (from 1863), before turning <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> separate destinations. Use of the trail declined as the first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, making the trip west substantially faster, cheaper, and safer. Today, modern highways, such as Interstate 80 and Interstate 84, follow parts of the same course westward and pass through towns originally established to serve those using the Oregon Trail.|$|E

Shortly afterwards, New York executed a trade with the Memphis Grizzlies in which the Knicks acquired Darko Miličić in exchange for Quentin Richardson. The Knicks got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> worst ten-game start in franchise history, producing nine losses, with just one win. The Knicks responded by winning nine games and losing six in December. On January 24, 2010, the Knicks suffered their worst home loss in Madison Square Garden history against the Dallas Mavericks {{in front of a}} sellout crowd.

25|$|The 2011–12 season saw Everton get <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> now {{customary}} sluggish start, {{and were}} struggling in 16th {{place at the}} beginning of November. The turn of the year, and the signing of Nikica Jelavić from Rangers, saw fortunes improve dramatically, however. The club embarked on a sequence of only two defeats in 17 League and Cup matches, including wins over Manchester City, Chelsea and Tottenham. Everton also found themselves in an all-Merseyside FA Cup Semi-final for the right to play Tottenham or Chelsea in the final at Wembley. After taking the lead through a Jelavić goal, Everton were pegged {{back in the second half}} and conceded a late winner to end their Cup run for the season. This reverse not withstanding, it was Jelavić's goals (nine in 13 appearances since his transfer) that helped secure only four defeats in the last 24 league games, and a seventh-place finish, ahead of Liverpool for the first time in eight seasons.|$|E

25|$|To get to {{the rich}} new lands of the West Coast, there were two options: some sailed around the {{southern}} tip of South America during a six-month voyage, but 400,000 others walked there on an overland route of more than 2,000 miles (3,000km); their wagon trains usually left from Missouri. They moved in large groups under an experienced wagonmaster, bringing their clothing, farm supplies, weapons, and animals. These wagon trains followed major rivers, crossed prairies and mountains, and typically ended in Oregon and California. Pioneers generally attempted to complete the journey during a single warm season, usually over the course of six months. By 1836, when the first migrant wagon train was organized in Independence, Missouri, a wagon trail had been cleared to Fort Hall, Idaho. Trails were cleared further and further west, eventually reaching {{all the way to the}} Willamette Valley in Oregon. This network of wagon trails leading to the Pacific Northwest was later called the Oregon Trail. The eastern half of the route was also used by travelers on the California Trail (from 1843), Mormon Trail (from 1847), and Bozeman Trail (from 1863) before they turned <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> separate destinations.|$|E

500|$|Having {{been driven}} from Milan by an Imperial advance in late 1521, Lautrec had regrouped, {{attempting}} {{to strike at}} Colonna's lines of communication. [...] When the Swiss mercenaries in French service did not receive their pay, however, they demanded an immediate battle, and Lautrec was forced to attack Colonna's fortified position in the park of the Arcimboldi Villa Bicocca, north of Milan. [...] The Swiss pikemen advanced over open fields under heavy artillery fire to assault the Imperial positions, but were halted at a sunken road backed by earthworks. [...] Having suffered massive casualties from the fire of Spanish arquebusiers, the Swiss retreated. [...] Meanwhile, an attempt by French cavalry to flank Colonna's position proved equally ineffective. [...] The Swiss, unwilling to fight further, marched <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> cantons a few days later, and Lautrec retreated into Venetian territory with the remnants of his army.|$|E

The fort was constructed from coral blocks with walls approximately 15–20 feet high topped with 47 cannons. [...] The sea men who did not conform to the evening curfew were imprisoned in the fort. A visitor noted: [...] “must be <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> ships, or into the fort”, who also noted the condition of the sailors in the prison as: “caressed and hung upon by native girls, who flock here in the ship season, from other parts, to get the ready wages of sin.” ...|$|E

At noon on October 6, 1909, she subsequently married Gabrilowitsch {{in the drawing room}} at Stormfield, the Clemens home with Rev. Dr. Joseph H. Twitchell presiding. (Twitchell was a great friend of her father.) Her father said that the engagement was not new, having been [...] "made and dissolved twice six years ago." [...] He also said that the marriage was sudden because Gabrilowitsch had just recovered from a surgical operation he had undergone in the summer and they were about to head <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> new house in Berlin where he would begin his European season. Her sister, Jean Clemens, drowned in the bathtub on December 24, 1909 after having an epileptic seizure. On April 21, 1910, her father died and left his entire estate to her in a will dated August 17, 1909 which provided for quarterly payments of interest to keep it [...] "free from any control or interference from any husband she may have."

500|$|In {{the time}} of the Twelve Tables, a [...] "{{manifest}}" [...] thief and a [...] "non-manifest" [...] thief were treated differently. Manifest theft denoted some sort of being caught in the act. Being found later with the stolen thing was not manifest theft, unless it was found during a seemingly bizarre ritual (furtum lance licioque conceptum), whereby the searcher would come with a silver platter and wearing few clothes. Gaius is highly critical of the by-then obsolete ritual, imagining the platter was for removal of the goods. In practice, it may have been for an offering to the household gods. Being almost naked would have prevented the searcher bringing with him a thing he would then pretend to find. Gaius reports that manifest theft brought a penalty of a severe flogging and enslavement for freemen. Slaves found liable for manifest furtum would be thrown <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> deaths off the Tarpeian Rock. The manifest thief was at {{the time of}} the Twelve tables was not given a full trial, his case merely adjudicated by a magistrate. The extreme penalty must have acted as a deterrent. The victim could kill the thief on the spot in two situations: at night, and where the thief was using a weapon and had been verbally warned. The verbal warning was designed to make the act of killing more public, and prevent it being an underhand way of committing murder. This rule was accepted by Gaius but is questioned by Ulpian. The penalty for non-manifest theft was always double damages.|$|E

2500|$|Many written {{reports and}} testimonies {{collected}} by the Australian War Crimes Section of the Tokyo tribunal, and investigated by prosecutor William Webb (the future Judge-in-Chief), indicate that Japanese personnel {{in many parts of}} Asia and the Pacific committed acts of cannibalism against Allied prisoners of war. In many cases this was inspired by ever-increasing Allied attacks on Japanese supply lines, and the death and illness of Japanese personnel as a result of hunger. According to historian Yuki Tanaka: [...] "cannibalism was often a systematic activity conducted by whole squads and under the command of officers". This frequently involved murder for the purpose of securing bodies. For example, an Indian POW, Havildar Changdi Ram, testified that: [...] " [...] the Kempeitai beheaded [...] pilot.
