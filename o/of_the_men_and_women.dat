5|$|In What Starts Wars: Intentional Delusions Stratton {{presented}} nations, themselves {{collections of}} people, as triggering war from several delusions. Three of those delusions held by citizens were {{that their own}} country was a paragon of peace, that its arms were only to defend the land, and that when it fought, it fought only for what was right. Blaming the enemy rounded out this list justifying war. Stratton believed and stated people could be freed of these delusions {{and that there was}} no will to war integral to human nature. He saw both the need for and the ways to eliminate war in individuals and in their ways, and not in abstract or innate traits. Florence Finch Kelly, reviewing the book for the New York Times, saw Stratton's placing of both the blame and the responsibility on persons, of identifying the roots of war in the psyches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> his readers, as an action likely to discomfit those readers.|$|E

The first Spanish auto-da-fé did not take place until 1481 in Seville; six <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> subjected to this first religious ritual were later executed. The Inquisition had limited power in Portugal, having been established in 1536 and officially lasting until 1821, although its influence was much weakened with the government of the Marquis of Pombal {{in the second half of}} the 18th century. Autos-da-fé also took place in Mexico, Brazil and Peru: contemporary historians of the Conquistadors such as Bernal Díaz del Castillo record them. They also took place in the Portuguese colony of Goa, India, following the establishment of Inquisition there in 1562–1563.|$|E
25|$|The {{sandstone}} memorial sits on {{a concrete}} base step. Above this are three smooth-faced sandstone steps, {{two of which are}} the same width, separated by a thinner step. On the front face of the two larger steps are leaded marble plaques bearing the names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> who served in the Second World War. The uppermost step is capped with a cyma recta moulding from which the square pedestal projects. Marble plates are located on the side and front faces of the pedestal and bear an inscription {{in the form of a}} verse, the names of the 10 local men who fell and the 39 others who served in the First World War. Semi-circular hood-moulds are located over the top of each plaque. A series of moulded steps sit above this, on which the digger statue stands.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to this iteration of the Dalton saga was sharp. [...] Drew Fetherston, reviewing the movie for Newsday, called it [...] "claptrap" [...] and that [...] "action [...] is all that this NBC stinker has to offer". Faye Zuckerman of the Gainesville Sun called Dalton: Code of Vengeance II a [...] "plodder", complaining that [...] "this film insults its predecessor". Chicago Sun-Times reviewer Daniel Ruth gave Dalton: Code of Vengeance II a half-star review calling it [...] "revisionist", [...] "distasteful", and [...] "terrible television". Deriding the film as [...] "poorly written, badly acted, sloppily directed and choppily edited", he called it [...] "another {{slap in the face}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> who went to Southeast Asia to do a dirty job and came home to even dirtier exploitation". Ruth concluded, [...] "The viewer's best [...] "Code of Vengeance" [...] would be to reject these films." ...|$|E

500|$|The American {{participation}} in the Asian theater {{came to an end}} on August 14, 1945 [...] "V-J Day" [...] (Victory over Japan Day) when the Japanese surrendered by signing the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> who were discharged after the war returned to their civilian jobs or did as Antonio F. Moreno and made use of the educational benefits of the G.I. Bill. Others continued in the military as career soldiers and went on to serve in the Korean War. General Pedro del Valle was ordered back to Headquarters Marine Corps, where he was named Inspector General, a position which he held until January 1, 1948, when he retired with the rank of lieutenant general. Colonel Jaime Sabater was named commanding officer of the 3rd Marines, Fleet Marine Force, Western Pacific (formerly the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines) from October 1, 1947, to April 1, 1948, in Tsingtao, China.|$|E
500|$|Trueblood also {{delivered}} {{speeches and}} gave dramatic readings on tours {{all over the}} world. One newspaper noted: [...] "As a reader Prof. Trueblood is well known throughout the west. [...] His readings are taken from the best literature, with special attention to Shakespearean work. [...] It is his plan to give the principal scenes of the play, narrating the unimportant parts, thus providing an entertainment acceptable {{to those who do}} not attend the theater." [...] After a performance of Hamlet in 1908, an Iowa newspaper wrote: [...] "Prof. Trueblood is a man of remarkable personality. [...] His cuttings of the play were taken from the most dramatic parts, giving a wide range of understanding of all the characters. [...] Not only were the different parts interpreted with extremely keen judgment of the most real kind, but the speaker introduced each division with a brief description and delineation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> who appeared. [...] Prof. Trueblood's manner of speaking and his diction are acquirements of a very high character and he held the interest of his hearers from beginning to end." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Approaching The Possible by Jo Storm, {{the season}} 2 episode [...] "1969" [...] showed that Hammond climbed the {{military}} ladder [...] "by being shrewd, intelligent, and [...] {{possessed of a}} long vision" [...] despite being a [...] "spouted bottom-line pragmatis". Don S. Davis described General Hammond as initially [...] "hard-nosed and straight-ahead", and later as seemingly [...] "stern and straight-laced". Recognizing the need to fulfill the role as a General, Davis still tried to [...] "bring a few levels to him that show some understanding and that make him a little more likeable." [...] The welfare <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> under Hammond's command is paramount in the general's mind. Besides knowing that people may not return from his sanctioned missions, General Hammond has to decide when to forgo rescue attempts to not put more lives in danger, even if he [...] "always does so reluctantly and with regret". As shown in [...] "Chain Reaction", Hammond would rather leave the military quietly than risk the careers and lives of his staff and his family, [...] "which must go against all his blustery Texas background".|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} Jennifer Worth's memoir Call the Midwife (2002, reissued 2007), {{which became a}} major best-seller and was adapted by the BBC into their most popular new {{programme}} since the current ratings system began, {{has led to a}} high level of interest in true-life stories from the East End. Melanie McGrath's Silvertown (2003), about her grandmother's life in the East End, was also a best-seller, as was the follow-up Hopping, about the annual East Enders' 'holiday' hop-picking in Kent. [...] A raft of similar books was published in the 2000s, among them Gilda O'Neill's best-selling Our Street (2004), Piers Dudgeon's Our East End (2009), Jackie Hyam's Bombsites and Lollipops (2011) and Grace Foakes' Four Meals for Fourpence (reprinted 2011). In 2012, HarperCollins published The Sugar Girls, a book which tells the true stories of women working at Tate & Lyle's factories in Silvertown since 1944. [...] The authors commented that many of the East Enders they interviewed were unhappy with the way their neighbourhoods had previously been portrayed in books and on screen – as squalid and criminal, in the Dickensian vein, and as a result they were keen to emphasise the positive aspects of East End life and community. 2012 also saw the publication of Spitalfields Life, a book adapted from the very successful blog of the same name, in which 'the gentle author' (who is anonymous) writes about, and celebrates, the lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> who live and work in the East End community of Spitalfields.|$|E
