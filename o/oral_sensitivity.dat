40|$|Abstract Background Many tussive {{agents are}} {{components}} of foods, but {{little is known}} about the relationship between cough reflex and <b>oral</b> chemesthesis <b>sensitivities.</b> We investigated the relationships between cough reflex and oral chemesthesis in individuals using two transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1) agonists with different potencies: capsaicin and capsiate. Methods Twenty-eight healthy never-smokers were allocated to evaluate cough and oral chemesthesis of capsinoids. Cough reflex sensitivities are estimated by the lowest concentrations generating five coughs by each TRPV 1 agonist inhalation. <b>Oral</b> chemesthesis <b>sensitivities</b> are estimated by the lowest concentrations which generate a hot sensation when filter paper loaded with each TRPV 1 agonist is placed on the tongue. Results There were strong correlations between capsaicin- and capsiate-induced cough reflex sensitivities, and between capsaicin- and capsiate-induced <b>oral</b> chemesthesis <b>sensitivities.</b> However, there were no significant correlations between cough reflex and <b>oral</b> chemesthesis <b>sensitivities</b> induced by both capsaicin and capsiate. The cough reflex sensitivities are significantly greater in females than in males whereas there were no gender differences in oral chemesthesis. Conclusion The results showed that the sensitivities of sensory afferents were different between cough reflex and oral chemesthesis, suggesting that TRPV 1 sensitivities differ between organs within healthy individuals. Capsiate could be a tussigen for the cough challenge test. </p...|$|R

40|$|Compared {{to simple}} sugars, complex {{carbohydrates}} have been assumed invisible to taste. However, two recent studies proposed {{that there may}} be a perceivable taste quality elicited by complex carbohydrates independent of sweet taste. There is precedent with behavioural studies demonstrating that rats are very attracted to complex carbohydrates, and that complex carbohydrates are preferred to simple sugars at low concentrations. This suggests that rats may have independent taste sensors for simple sugars and complex carbohydrates. The aim of this paper is to investigate <b>oral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of two different classes of complex carbohydrates (a soluble digestible and a soluble non-digestible complex carbohydrate), and to compare these to other caloric and non-nutritive sweeteners in addition to the prototypical tastes using two commonly used psychophysical measures. There were strong correlations between the detection thresholds and mean intensity ratings for complex carbohydrates (maltodextrin, oligofructose) (r = 0. 94, P 0. 05). However, moderate correlations were observed between perceived intensities of complex carbohydrates and sweeteners (r = 0. 48 - 0. 61, P < 0. 05). These data provide evidence that complex carbohydrates can be sensed in the oral cavity over a range of concentrations independent of sweet taste sensitivity at low concentrations, but with partial overlap with sweet taste intensity at higher concentrations...|$|R

In addition, saliva can interact with dietary fat during its consumption and influence the perception of fatty acids. Because previous studies had identified subjects who were hyper- and hyposensitive to the perception of free fatty acids, the first aim of this work was to study whether saliva composition is different in groups of subjects having low and high <b>oral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to a free fatty acid, oleic acid (C 18 : 1). The second aim {{was to determine whether}} oral stimulation with C 18 : 1 could modify the composition of saliva. To verify these hypotheses, two groups of individuals were selected from a panel of 73 subjects: one group sensitive + to C 18 : 1 (n = 12) and one sensitive - to C 18 : 1 (n = 13). Overall, no differences were found in the saliva characteristics between the two groups. However, significant differences after C 18 : 1 stimulation when comparing to a control stimulation were observed in the sensitive + group: in this group, the increase in antioxidant capacity and the decrease in lipolytic activity were significant, while it was not in the sensitive - group although the median values were similar for this last variable in the two groups. This would suggest that the response given by the salivary system to fatty acid stimulation is different in groups of subjects having low and high <b>oral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to C 18 : 1...|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence supporting an oral chemosensory detection system for {{free fatty acids}} (FFA). The presumptive transduction mechanisms have different ligand specificities.

40|$|Objectives: The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} and compare the clinical characteristics of 2 groups of children presenting to a feeding clinic: children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and children with a nonmedically complex history (NMC). A secondary aim was to compare participants according to the degree of oral motor impairment, presence of oral hypersensitivity, and clinically significant parent stress. Methods: Children with feeding difficulties ages between 2 and 6 years were recruited. Prospective data were collected on dietary intake, general development, mealtime behaviors, oral motor skills, oral sensory processing, and parental stress via parent questionnaire and clinical assessment. Results: In total, 68 children (ASD = 33 and NMC = 35) participated in the study. Both groups presented with a large number of difficult mealtime behaviors. Although stress was elevated in both groups, parents of children in the ASD group reported significantly higher stress levels than those with children in the NMC group (mean difference 27. 3 on a percentile scale, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 15. 5 – 39. 2, P < 0. 01). Across both groups, the majority of children presented with mild-to-moderate oral motor impairments (ASD = 28, 85 %; NMC = 28, 80 %). Children with heightened <b>oral</b> sensory <b>sensitivity</b> consumed significantly fewer unprocessed fruits and vegetables (mean difference 3. 3 foods, 95 % CI 1. 3 – 5. 3, P < 0. 01), and their parents reported a significantly greater frequency of difficult mealtime behaviors (mean difference 5. 8 behaviors, 95 % CI 3. 4 – 8. 1, P < 0. 01).

The first aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the correlation between the analytical data obtained in the plasma and oral fluid samples, to evaluate the use of oral fluid as a 'predictor' of actual cannabis influence. The results of the study indicated a good accuracy when comparing THC detection in oral fluid and plasma (84. 9 - 95. 7 % depending on the cut-off used for plasma analysis). ROC curve analysis was subsequently used to determine the optimal cut-off value for THC in oral fluid with plasma as reference sample, in order to 'predict' a positive plasma result for THC. When using the LOQ of the method for plasma (0. 5 ng/mL), the optimal cut-off was 1. 2 ng/mL THC in <b>oral</b> fluid (<b>sensitivity,</b> 94. 7 %; specificity, 92. 0 %). When using the legal cut-off in Belgium for driving under the influence in plasma (2 ng/mL), an optimal cut-off value of 5. 2 ng/mL THC in <b>oral</b> fluid (<b>sensitivity,</b> 91. 6 %; specificity, 88. 6 %) was observed. In the second part of the study, the performance of the on-site Dräger DrugTest® for the screening of THC in oral fluid during roadside controls was assessed by comparison with the corresponding LC-MS-MS results in plasma and oral fluid.

40|$|Ice {{cream is}} a popular, yet complex, multi-phase/colloidal foodstuff. To {{understand}} how this complex microstructure influences the eating behaviour of the consumer requires an interdisciplinary collaboration between Chemical Engineering and Psychology. Thus, {{an understanding of how}} product formulation affects consumer preference could be derived and could possibly be used for either product reformulation or promotion. Experiments explored and quantified the physical properties of the ice cream and how these structures translated into the sensory qualities within the human participants. This involved measuring the consumer’s preferences and the potential satiating qualities from different formulations. Destabilisation times of basic emulsions were also examined. The in-depth examination of the eating behaviour of ice cream used an universal eating machine. This showed, that regardless of formulation quality, the rate and total amount consumed remained relatively constant. This counter-intuitive result also persisted over repeated exposures to the product. By manipulating the physical structure of the ice cream (ice crystal phase through temperature manipulation), an understanding of the limits of <b>oral</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> and consumer perception of an altered product could be gained through a triangle test.

40|$|While {{epidemiological}} studies have revealed a strong {{positive relationship between}} the intake of dietary fat with total energy intake and body weight, laboratory-based studies investigating physiological effects of fat have demonstrated that the direct exposure of receptors in the oral cavity and small intestine to fat, specifically fatty acids (FAs), induces potent effects on gastrointestinal (GI) motility and gut peptide secretion that favor the suppression of appetite and energy intake. Recent studies in humans have demonstrated an association between a decreased ability to detect the presence of FAs in the oral cavity with increased energy intake and body mass index suggesting that impairment of oral fat sensing mechanisms may contribute to overeating and obesity. Furthermore, while sensing {{of the presence of}} FAs in the small intestine results in the modulation of GI motility, stimulation of GI hormone release, including cholecystokinin (CCK) and peptide YY (PYY), and suppression of subsequent energy intake, recent data indicate that these effects of fat are attenuated in individuals with reduced <b>oral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to fat, and following consumption of a high-fat diet. This review will focus on emerging knowledge about the physiological mechanisms that sense the presence of fat in both the oral cavity and the small intestine, and environmental factors, such as high-fat diet exposure and energy restriction, that may modulate sensitivity to nutrients, and thereby contribute to the regulation of appetite and body weight.

40|$|Objectives: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) {{is among}} the most {{frequent}} complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). GVHD has several clinical manifestations in the oral cavity, including painful desquamative erythema, ulcerative mucosal lesions, and lichenoid lesions. The patients presenting with oral GVHD complain of <b>oral</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> pain, dysgeusia, and xerostomia. The treatment of oral GVHD includes a proper systemic therapy combined with a good oral hygiene and the use of local and topical steroids. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are used for the treatment of chronic oral GVHD; however, they are associated with different complications. Evidence shows that curcumin has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. The treatment of lichen planus and oral mucositis with curcumin has been successful. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of topical curcumin in Orabase and triamcinolone in Orabase in the patients affected by oral GVHD. Materials and Methods: Twenty-six patients presenting with oral GVHD were randomly divided into two groups of 13 using block randomization.

40|$|Stroke is {{considered}} one of the leading causes of death and acquired disability with a peak prevalence over the age of 80 years. Stroke may cause debilitating neurological deficiencies that frequently result in sensory deficits, motor impairment, muscular atrophy, cognitive deficits and psychosocial impairment. Oro-facial impairment may occur due to the frequent involvement of the cranial nerves' cortical representation areas, central nervous system pathways or motoneuron pools. The aim of this narrative, non-systematic review was to discuss the implications of stroke on oro-facial functions and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). Stroke patients demonstrate an impaired masticatory performance, possibly due to reduced tongue forces and disturbed <b>oral</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Furthermore, facial asymmetry is common, but mostly discrete and lip restraining forces are reduced. Bite force is not different between the ipsi- and contra-lesional side. In contrast, the contra-lesional handgrip strength and tongue-palate contact during swallowing are significantly impaired. OHRQoL is significantly reduced mainly because of the functional impairment. It can be concluded that impaired chewing efficiency, dysphagia, facial asymmetry, reduced lip force and OHRQoL are quantifiable symptoms of oro-facial impairment following a stroke. In the absence of functional rehabilitation, these symptoms seem not to improve. Furthermore, stroke affects the upper limb and the masseter muscle differently, both, at a functional and a morphological level. The rehabilitation of stroke survivors should, therefore, also seek to improve the strength and co-ordination of the oro-facial musculature. This would in turn help improve OHRQoL and the masticatory function, subsequently preventing weight loss and malnutrition...|$|E

METHODS: Observational prospective study of 124 treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C not fulfilling the metabolic syndrome criteria, adherent to a standard treatment with pegylated interferon alpha plus ribavirin. RESULTS: Insulin resistance was detected in 50 % (by HOMA-IR) and 29 % (by <b>oral</b> glucose insulin <b>sensitivity</b> index) of patients. Independent predictors of rapid virologic response were hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 (odds ratio 5. 66; 95 % confidence interval 1. 88 - 17. 01), HCV genotype 3 (odds ratio 5. 23; 95 % confidence interval 1. 84 - 14. 84) and lower basal ferritin levels (odds ratio 0. 99; 95 % confidence interval 0. 993 - 0. 998).

Methods: Twelve men with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes, 13 with metabolic syndrome and 12 age-matched healthy normoglycaemic controls, mean age 57 ± 6 years, underwent skin capillary video microscopy before and 60 and 120 min following a standardised mixed meal to measure baseline capillary density (BCD) and capillary density during post-occlusive peak reactive hyperaemia (PRH), also termed capillary recruitment. <b>Oral</b> glucose insulin <b>sensitivity</b> (Matsuda index) and postprandial hyperglycaemia (2 h AU...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to improve the understanding of oral texture perception. In particular to examine the role of oral physiological processes on oral texture perception of semi-solids and to investigate whether individual differences in perception could be attributed to differences in oral physiology among subjects. The main results reveal that: •	Large intra-individual differences in oral physiology and sensory ratings were confirmed. •	Oral size perception results from a combination of sensory inputs from the palate and the tongue. Size itself determines the size perception of single objects, while material and weight are negligible factors. •	For particles mixed into a medium, size and type of particle influenced size perception, which is suggested to be mediated by vibration. Soft and round particles are perceived as smaller than hard and irregular particles. •	The two methods - direct-scaling and forced ranking - produce similar results on size perception. •	Some measurements of <b>oral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> correlate, such as masticatory performance and size perception of spheres. Subjects who are poor chewers are more sensitive to particles in sizes which could cause then discomfort on swallowing. •	The natural volume of saliva did not affect the texture perceptions, presumably because the subjects were used to their inherent levels of saliva. In contrast, a change in the natural amounts of saliva, realized by an artificial addition of saliva or saliva related fluids, did affect attributes related to dilution and breakdown of the product, such as thickness and melting. •	The composition of saliva exhibited correlations with the perception of numerous texture attributes. The fractions of solubles in the saliva, many of which have enzymatic, lubricative or other actions important for mastication, do seem to be important for the perception of semi-solids. Accordingly, the attributes for custard dessert, which is thickened mainly by starch, were especially sensitive to the activity of amylase and proteins. •	The sensation of virtually all flavour and mouth-feel attributes requires at least some tongue movement. Most attributes showed a similar pattern, with lowest attribute ratings where the tongue’s movement was restricted and gradually increasing ratings with increasing complexity of the tongue movements. An individual’s normal mastication behaviour, which exhibited the largest diversity and complexity of movements, typically resulted in the most intense sensations of flavour and mouth-feel. This suggests that consumers aim to maximize their food sensations. •	The addition of particles to a custard dessert had large effects on perception of the texture attributes. Roughness increased with increasing particle size and hardness, while smooth, slippery, creamy and fatty decreased, irrespective of type of particle. Very small particles (2 µm) also have strong effects on the perception. Subjects who perceive particles of a certain size to be large, do not perceived that same stimulus to be rough. Hence, particles need to be sufficiently small to be considered part of the stimulus. •	The primary result of an increase in stimulus temperature probably was the decrease in stimulus viscosity, which was reflected in decreased perception of thickness. With the decrease in viscosity, a number of secondary effects were observed, such as facilitated migration of fat {{to the surface of the}} product, resulting in more fatty sensations. The results demonstrate that the oral physiological parameters <b>oral</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> tongue movements, temperature and saliva composition are of importance for texture perception of semi-solids. Many parameters of oral physiology correlated with various texture attributes. This implies that intra-individual differences in texture perception could be attributed to variations in oral physiology. Oral physiology thus plays a role in texture perception of semi-solids and should be taken into account in future texture research...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{reports that}} the {{sensitivity}} to the bitter tasting substance 6 -n-propylthiouracil (PROP) {{is related to the}} sensitivity to other tastes, to chemical irritants, and to fats and oils have led to adoption of PROP as a measure of general <b>oral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and as a predictor of dietary habits that could impact health. The results, however, have not been consistent. It was recently discovered that the ability to perceive ‘‘thermal taste’ ’ (i. e., sweetness from thermal stimulation alone) was associated with higher responsiveness to 4 prototypical taste stimuli but not to PROP. This finding implied that individual differences in taste perception are determined in large part by factors other than those related to genetic expression of the PROP receptor. The present study followed up this observation by comparing individual differences in perception of 4 prototypical taste stimuli (sucrose, NaCl, citric acid, and quinine) and PROP under conditions that also enabled assessment of the reliability of individual intensity ratings of taste. Creaminess ratings of 3 milk products that had different fat contents were also collected to investigate further the relationship between taste and oral somatosensory perception. The results showed that intensity ratings across 2 trials were significantly correlated for all 5 taste stimuli and that averaging across replicates led to significant correlations among the 4 prototypical stimuli. In contrast, the bitterness of PROP was correlated only with the bitterness of quinine. None of the taste stimuli, including PROP, was significantly correlated with ratings of creaminess. These results imply 1) that with the exception of PROP, as few as 2 intensity ratings of common taste stimuli can reveal individual differences in overal...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{influence}} of taste perception on food choice has captured the interest of academics, industry, and the general public. The latter {{as evidenced by the}} extent of popular media coverage and use of the term supertaster. Supertasters are highly sensitive to the bitter tastant propylthiouracil (PROP) and its chemical relative phenylthiocarbamide. The well-researched differences in taste sensitivity to these bitter chemicals are partially controlled by variation in the TAS 2 R 38 gene; however this variation alone does not explain the supertaster phenomenon. It has been suggested that density of papillae, which house taste buds, may explain supertasting. To address the unresolved role of papillae, we used crowdsourcing in the museum-based Genetics of Taste Lab. This community lab is uniquely situated to attract both a large population of human subjects and host a team of citizen scientists to research population-based questions about human genetics, taste, and health. Using this model, we find that PROP bitterness is not in any way predicted by papillae density. This result holds within the whole sample, when divided into major diplotypes, and when correcting for age, sex, and genotype. Furthermore, it holds when dividing participants into oft-used taster status groups. These data argue against the use of papillae density in predicting taste sensitivity and caution against imprecise use of the term supertaster. Furthermore, it supports a growing volume of evidence that sets the stage for hyperguesia, a reconceptualization of heightened <b>oral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> that is not based solely on PROP or papillae density. Finally, our model demonstrates how community-based research can serve as a unique venue for both study participation and citizen science that makes scientific research accessible and relevant to people’s everyday lives...|$|E
40|$|Context: In {{the past}} decade, over 3 dozen studies {{reported}} {{a relationship between}} self-reported short sleep and disturbed glucose metabolism. A study with insulin sensitivity assessed according to the gold standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp is, however, still missing. Objective: To evaluate the cross-sectional association of sleep duration with insulin sensitivity and β-cell function in the European group {{for the study of}} insulin resistance (EGIR-RISC) study cohort. Design, Setting, Participants, and Measures:Weused data from the baseline measurements of the European, multicentre EGIR-RISC study that included 1319 clinically healthy participants. Sleep and physical activity were measured using a single-axis accelerometer. Insulin sensitivity and β-cell function were estimated by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and from the <b>oral</b> glucose insulin <b>sensitivity</b> index model, using an oral glucose tolerance test. Associations of sleep duration with insulin sensitivity and β-cell function were analyzed by multiple linear regression, stratified by sex. Results: In our current analysis, we included 788 participants (57 % women, age 44 ± 8 y), who had an average sleep duration of 7. 3 ± 1. 5 hours. In men,weobserved an inverted U-shaped association between sleep duration categorized per hour and M/I (in μmol/min per kgFFM/nM per hour) (±- estimate [95 % confidence intervals] 41 [2, 80]; P =. 04 and β 2 -estimate - 3 [- 6, - 0. 2], P =. 04) as well as a trend for the <b>oral</b> glucose insulin <b>sensitivity</b> index (in mL/min per kgFFM) (β-estimate [95 % confidence intervals] 0. 8 [- 0. 4, 2]; P =. 17). In women, we observed a U-shaped association between sleep duration and β-cell function (in pmol/min perm 2 /mM per hour) (β-estimate- 45 [- 86, - 3]; P =. 04 and β 2 -estimate 3 [0. 2, 6]; P =. 04). Conclusions: Sleep duration is associated with insulin sensitivity and β-cell function in a sex-specific manner in clinically healthy people...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} role of partial {{coalescence}} of whey protein-stabilized emulsions on sensory perception. The selection of fats was restricted to vegetable fats that are essentially melted at <b>oral</b> temperatures. The <b>sensitivity</b> to partial coalescence was controlled by {{a variation in the}} fat melting curve and by addition of unsaturated monoglyceride. Most fat-related sensory attributes appear to be well-correlated to an increase in viscosity and coalescence in the mouth due to partial coalescence. Moreover, it was found that in-mouth aeration induces extra coalescence, which increases the perception of fat-related sensory attributes significantly. Monoglyceride addition induces a shift of the sensory perception of fattiness and other fat-related attributes. There are clear indications that monoglyceride addition affects sensory perception not only by promoting partial coalescence, but also by an additional effect such as its surface activity...|$|R
