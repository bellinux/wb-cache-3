50|$|An in-building {{cellular}} enhancement system, commonly {{implemented in}} conjunction with a distributed antenna system (DAS), is a telecommunications solution which is used to extend and distribute the cellular signal of a given mobile network operator (hereafter abbreviated as an MNO) within a building. In the United States, operators commonly supported by such solutions include AT&T Mobility, Verizon Wireless, Sprint Corporation, T-Mobile US, in addition to smaller regional carriers as required. Below ground level, large buildings and high rises are examples where mobile phones are unable to properly reach the carrier's macro or <b>outdoor</b> <b>network.</b> In these environments, the in-building cellular enhancement system will connect to the carrier's signal source which is typically a bi-directional amplifier or a base transceiver station. This signal source transmits (and receives) the mobile network operator's licensed radio frequency. This frequency is then transported within the building using coaxial cable, optical fiber or Category 5e/Category 6 twisted pair cable. In-building coverage antennas are strategically placed to provide the best overall coverage for users.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{explore the}} {{feasibility}} of designing an outdoor cellular network based on the IEEE 802. 11 specification. Since the standard is intended for wireless local-area networks (WLAN), there are many technical challenges when applying the air interface to the outdoor environment. We study here how the 802. 11 medium access control (MAC) protocol can be applied and how it performs in the <b>outdoor</b> <b>network.</b> By exploiting the fact that timeout intervals are not explicitly specified, without modifying the standard, we propose a new timing structure for the distribution coordination function (DCF) and the handshake of request-to-send (RTS) and clear-to-send (CTS) to handle increased signal propagation delay in the <b>outdoor</b> <b>network.</b> We find that the DCF and RTS/CTS protocols as specified in the standard continue to work properly for a link distance up to 6 km.

40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the {{applicability}} of a repeater connected to a distributed antenna system for improving indoor capacity in UMTS radio network. A guarantee of sufficient coverage and capacity for in-building areas constitutes a considerable issue in topology planning, because in both links, indoor users produce high interference to the <b>outdoor</b> <b>network</b> due to significant indoor propagation losses. Presented configuration effectively exploits effectively a repeater system that amplifies the signal from the <b>outdoor</b> <b>network</b> and delivers it for indoor locations through distributed antenna system. Implementation of the analyzed repeater system is straightforward as it does not require usage of separate carrier. Moreover, any separate scrambling codes do not have to be dedicated either. Conducted measurement campaigns reveal improvement of radio conditions due to repeater implementation that results in 35 % gain of downlink capacity for indoor locations. Furthermore, in the analyzed scenario, the average value of SIR is improved by 3. 41 dB that might lead to an increase of capacity in HSDPA as well. Simultaneously, the executed measurements illustrate the positive impact of the indoor DAS solution on the downlink capacity of the surrounding macrocellular network.

30|$|It can {{be noted}} that the {{solution}} of optimising the FAP location does not significantly degrade the <b>outdoor</b> <b>network</b> performance. By moving the FAP from centre to a point that is closer to the outdoor interference source, the interference from the FAP to the outside network is increased by up to 2.5 dB. Given that the outdoor interference is more dominated by outdoor interference from other micro-cells the total interference is not significantly increased. This is to say that the interference generated by the FAP to outdoor users is not significantly increased.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Wireless radios {{are a great}} {{consumer}} of energy in sensor networks. Retrieving data from a remote deployment in an energy-efficient fashion is a difficult problem, and while solutions have been proposed in literature, real-world systems typically implement robust though inefficient methods. In an effort to bring efficient monitoring techniques to real-world environmental sensor networks, we seek to now quantify the performance brought by these algorithms in practical terms, i. e., by their resulting reduction in overall station energy consumption. To this end, we have developed a power monitoring extension board that integrates seamlessly with a commercial environmental sensor network platform. The board is capable of measuring all incoming and outgoing power for a station, and can disconnect subsystems, such as the solar panel or sensor bus, as necessary. The board is currently deployed on an <b>outdoor</b> <b>network</b> and is undergoing extensive testing. I...|$|E

The {{application programming interface}} (API) between the sensor network and the geolocation database implements an effective and secure connection to successfully gather sensing data and sends it to the geolocation database for post-processing. On the other hand, the testbed allows authorized TV white space devices {{to gain access to}} the services of the geolocation database, according to a draft implementation of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Protocol to Access White Space (PAWS) Two experimental methodologies are available with the testbed: one focused on coexistence studies with commercial wireless microphones, when the testbed is used for sensing only, and another for demonstration purposes, when the testbed is also used to emulate wireless microphone signals. Overall, this hybrid approach is a promising solution for the effective use of TV white spaces and for the coexistence with digital TV broadcast signals, or dynamic incumbent systems, such as unregistered wireless microphones.|$|E
