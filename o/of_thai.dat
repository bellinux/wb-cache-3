5|$|Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum was {{released}} on 14 January 1956 during the festive occasion <b>of</b> <b>Thai</b> Pongal.

The songs also attained popularity. The film was later dubbed in Telugu as Ali Baba 40 Dongalu.|$|E

It received positive reviews from critics, who particularly praised Ramachandran's performance, as he was known for doing mainly action-adventure films up until that point in his career. The film was also a commercial success, with a theatrical run of over 23 weeks. It was also dubbed into Telugu, under the title Prema Manasulu.|$|E
5|$|Living River Siam has {{compiled}} {{the research and}} oral accounts <b>of</b> <b>Thai</b> villagers into many publications, which they make available on their website. Its published books document local knowledge about fish, the results of village research, a how-to manual for Thai Baan research, and citizens' guides to defending Thai rivers and communities. They also have produced posters of fish species and dams, pamphlets on fishing gear, and short documentaries about the river.|$|E
5|$|Riesling is a {{versatile}} wine for pairing with food, {{because of its}} balance of sugar and acidity. It can be paired with white fish or pork, {{and is one of}} the few wines that can stand up to the stronger flavours and spices <b>of</b> <b>Thai</b> and Chinese cuisine. A Riesling's typical aromas are of flowers, tropical fruits, and mineral stone (such as slate or quartz), although, with time, the wine acquires a petrol note as mentioned above.|$|E

5|$|The Phra Thinang Dusit Maha Prasat (พระที่นั่งดุสิตมหาปราสาท) {{dominates the}} Maha Prasat group. The throne hall {{was built on}} a {{symmetrical}} cruciform plan, the roof is topped with a tall gilded spire. The hall is considered an ideal archetype <b>of</b> <b>Thai</b> traditional architecture. Every aspect of the exterior decoration of the throne hall is imbuded with symbolism. The hall is built {{in the shape of}} a tall mountain to represent Mount Meru, the mythological centre of the universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{diminishing}} {{number of}} troops available to Vang Pao demanded their replacement by growing numbers <b>of</b> <b>Thai</b> volunteers (Project Unity), who increasingly took over the ground war in the north. By the end of 1971, the entire 55-man battalion of Thais were in action, whose total numbers were 6,000–8,000 men. During the following year, those numbers had ballooned to 17,800. The total force eventually deployed was three artillery and 27 infantry battalions.|$|E
5|$|Aayirathil Oruvan languished in {{development}} hell due to slow {{progress of the}} shoot and the extensive pre- and post-production works, evading release dates ranging one year. Shooting began in July 2007, and took place in various locations with 2,000 extras in areas including Chalakudy, Kerala and Jaisalmer, Rajasthan amongst other regions throughout India. Uncut, the film runs for over 220 minutes, but the theatrical release was heavily cut at 183 minutes. The film released coinciding with the festival <b>of</b> <b>Thai</b> Pongal on 14 January 2010, with a Telugu dubbing version, titled Yuganikki Okkadu, following six weeks later. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews whilst proceeding to become a successful venture commercially.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Sutorius eximius {{grow in the}} soil singly or {{scattered}} among leaf litter. A mycorrhizal species, the bolete has been recorded growing in association with plants from various genera, including Dicymbe, Dipterocarpus, Fagus, Hopea, Quercus, Shorea, and Tsuga. The species has been recorded from North America, Costa Rica, and Indonesia. In Costa Rica, where it usually associates with the endemic oaks Quercus seemannii and Q.copeyensis, the lilac-brown bolete can be locally abundant in the Cordillera Central and the Cordillera de Talamanca. Additional locations with collections {{that have not been}} confirmed by DNA analysis include Guyana, Japan, China. Although S.eximius has been reported from Thailand, molecular analysis <b>of</b> <b>Thai</b> collections suggests that they represent a distinct, as-yet unnamed species.|$|E
5|$|The incongruous make-up {{between the}} Western lower half and Thai roof has been {{compared}} with a Farang (Western) lady clothed in Victorian costume while wearing a Thai crown. The symbolism of this juxtaposition is the emphasis of the superiority <b>of</b> <b>Thai</b> architecture (as a crown upon the head) over those of the West (the {{lower half of the}} body). This stylistic innovation was more than an artistic coincidence, as it was supposed to convey a significant political message of Siamese resistance over Western imperialism, both of sovereignty and style. From another perspective, the building itself epitomizes the internal political struggle between the ideas of Westernization and modernity (led by King Rama V) against those of the traditional ruling elites (as led by some of his early ministers).|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} from non-governmental organizations {{has been more}} favorable. The Mekong Wetlands Biodiversity Programme (MWBP), an international alliance managed by the United Nations Development Programme and World Conservation Union, has published {{a study on the}} methodology <b>of</b> <b>Thai</b> Baan research and coordinated their own study in Sri Songkham district in 2004, concluding that it was more useful than top-down styles of village research. The study overseen by the MWBP was cited in an academic journal and submitted to an international conference. Living River Siam's spokesperson Pianporn Deetes was invited to a United Nations Environment Programme conference on dams.|$|E
