5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is sliced into triangular shapes. Chestnut flour is sometimes used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, sometimes using a two-stage cooking process. In the typical first stage, and sometimes only stage of cooking, the batter is poured and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of a pancake or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a testo, which may be prepared for use by being heated <b>over</b> <b>hot</b> coals. A skillet is another cooking device {{that can be used to}} cook the batter. The pasta is then sliced into triangles, and is sometimes directly served after this cooking process. In the second cooking stage that is sometimes performed, the pasta may be set aside to cool, and then cooked further in boiling water.|$|E

These allegedly included waterboarding, electric shocks, burning with matches and candles, forcing internees to stand <b>over</b> <b>hot</b> electric fires while beating them, beating and squeezing of the genitals, inserting objects into the anus, injections, whipping the soles of the feet, and psychological abuse such as Russian roulette.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} offline {{preparation for}} the conversion is combustion over CuO at > 800°C in sealed quartz tubes, followed by the isolation of resulting water and the reduction to H2 <b>over</b> <b>hot</b> metal at 400 ~1000 oC on a vacuum line. The produced gas is then directly injected into the dual-inlet mass spectrometer for measurement. The metals used for the reduction to H2 includes U, Zn, Cr, Mg and Mn, etc. U and Zn had been widely used since the 1950s until Cr was successfully employed in the late 1990s.|$|E

25|$|British usage, barbecuing {{refers to}} a fast cooking process done {{directly}} over high heat, while grilling refers to cooking under a source of direct, moderate-to-high heat—known in the United States as broiling. In American English usage, grilling {{refers to a}} fast process over high heat while barbecuing refers to a slow process using indirect heat or hot smoke, similar to some forms of roasting. In a typical U.S. home grill, food is cooked on a grate directly <b>over</b> <b>hot</b> charcoal, while in a U.S. barbecue the coals are dispersed to the sides or at a significant distance from the grate. Its South American versions are the southern Brazilian churrasco and the Argentine asado.|$|E
25|$|Campfires {{have been}} used for cooking since time immemorial. Possibly the {{simplest}} method of cooking over a campfire {{and one of the most}} common is to roast food on long skewers that can be held above the flames. This is a popular technique for cooking hot dogs or toasting marshmallows for making s'mores. This type of cooking over the fire typically consists of comfort foods that are easy to prepare. There is also no clean up involved unlike an actual kitchen. Another technique is to use pie irons—small iron molds with long handles. Campers put slices of bread with some kind of filling into the molds and put them <b>over</b> <b>hot</b> coals to cook. Campers sometimes use elaborate grills, cast iron pots, and fire irons to cook. Often, however, they use portable stoves for cooking instead of campfires. :For more information, see Campfire cooking.|$|E
25|$|In both {{town and}} country, {{means of access}} between the main house and the servant's wings were kept to a minimum, often the single door would be lined with green baize to deaden any sound. Long and {{complicated}} passages linking kitchens with dining rooms were devised; in some houses the tortuous route through corridors and staircases from kitchen to dining room could be an eighth of a mile – an absence of cooking smells taking priority <b>over</b> <b>hot</b> food. Even the doors linking to the connecting corridors would be covered by screens, sometimes disguised as bookcases with dummy books, or just simply covered in the same wallpaper as that with which the room was decorated, as the existence of servants {{was not to be}} acknowledged. Cleaning had to be performed {{in the early hours of}} the morning while the employers were asleep, and in the grander houses only male servants were allowed to be visible, and then only when required.|$|E

The conditions were particularly difficult for the riders in the gruppetto, as the conditions they faced in the final kilometres were significantly worse than those faced by the race leaders. Cancellara and other riders called for an extreme-weather policy to govern racing in such conditions.|$|E
500|$|Bougna is a {{traditional}} Kanak casserole, considered a national food by many Kanaks. [...] It is made of sliced root vegetables which might include taro, manioc, yams and coconut milk. Pork, chicken or seafood {{may be used in}} the filling which is then wrapped in poingo banana leaves before being cooked <b>over</b> <b>hot</b> stones in an earthen oven. Other local ingredients used in Kanak cuisine include Rousettus (flying foxes) and local deer; marine staples such as lagoon and coral reef fish (including dawa), as well as crabs and lobsters. Paita beans are locally grown haricots, while custard-apple, lime and saffron are other local ingredients.|$|E
500|$|Foods were {{commonly}} {{prepared by}} boiling in water (at first using green bamboo as a vessel, and later clay or iron pots), roasting over a fire or grilling <b>over</b> <b>hot</b> stones or coals. Fermentation {{was also used}} to create curds from milk, develop the flavor of certain dried or fresh tubers or produce alcoholic beverages from honey, sugar cane juice or other local plants. The techniques of sun curing (drying), smoking and salting were used to preserve various foods for transport, trade or future consumption. Many foods prepared in these ways, such as a smoked dried beef called kitoza (...) and salted dried fish, are still eaten in a similar form in modern-day Madagascar.|$|E

500|$|Traditionally, {{clotted cream}} {{was created by}} {{straining}} fresh cow's milk, letting it stand in a shallow pan in a cool place for several hours to allow the cream {{to rise to the}} surface, then heating it either <b>over</b> <b>hot</b> cinders or in a water bath, before a slow cooling. The clots that formed on the top were then skimmed off with a long-handled cream-skimmer, known in Devon as a reamer or raimer. [...] By the mid-1930s, the traditional way of using milk brought straight from the dairy was becoming a rarity in Devon because using a cream separator actively separated the cream from the milk using centrifugal force, which produced far more clotted cream than the traditional method from the same amount of milk. As a farmer's wife in Poundsgate said, [...] "the separator saves a whole cow!" ...|$|E
500|$|An {{influential}} {{example is}} the 1731 novel Sethos by Jean Terrasson. Terrasson claimed he had translated this book from an ancient Greek work of fiction {{that was based on}} real events. The book was actually his own invention, inspired by ancient Greek sources that assumed Greek philosophy had derived from Egypt. In the novel, Egypt's priests run an elaborate education system like a European university. To join their ranks, the protagonist, Sethos, undergoes an initiation presided over by Isis, taking place in hidden chambers beneath the Great Pyramid of Giza. Based on Lucius' statement in Metamorphoses that he was [...] "borne through all the elements" [...] during his initiation, Terrasson describes the initiation as an elaborate series of ordeals, each based on one of the classical elements: running <b>over</b> <b>hot</b> metal bars for fire, swimming a canal for water, and swinging through the air over a pit.|$|E
500|$|Steam devils are {{vortices}} typically about 50 to 200 metres in diameter, essentially vertical, {{and up to}} 500 metres high. [...] The general {{shape is}} like a small waterspout but {{they should not be}} considered related. [...] Steam devils rotate with a cyclonic direction of motion, but not very fast or powerfully, usually just a few rotations per minute, and sometimes apparently not at all. [...] There is usually a well-defined inner part of the rotating column of steam and a more ragged outer part from which clumps of steam often detach. [...] Rather smaller steam devils can form over small lakes, especially the warm water in the hot springs of geyser basins. [...] In these cases typical dimensions are a metre or so diameter, but can vary from less than 0.1 to 2 metres, and a height of 2 to 30 metres with a somewhat faster rotation of 60 rpm or so. [...] The central core of the steam devil can be clear, in the same sense that the centre of a dust devil is clear of dust. [...] The core is around 10% of the width of the rotating column. [...] The sky above the steam devils may be clear, or there may be cumulus clouds present. [...] In some cases the steam devils may rise directly into the cumulus, in these cases the cumulus may actually be caused by the steam devils - see below. [...] Steam devils are a rare and short-lived phenomenon, typically surviving no more than three or four minutes, and the smaller ones <b>over</b> <b>hot</b> springs dissipating in a matter of seconds.Bluestein, p.151Holle (2007), p.9Lyons & Pease, pp.236-237Zurn-Birkhimer et al., p.2431 ...|$|E
