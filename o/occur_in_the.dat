5|$|Because American {{football}} is a full-contact sport, head injuries are relatively common. According to the San Francisco Spine Institute at Seton Medical Center in Daly City, California, up to 1.5 million young men participate in football annually, {{and there are}} an estimated 1.2 million football-related injuries per year. An estimated 51% of injuries occur during training sessions, while 49% occur elsewhere. Injuries are nearly 5 times more likely to happen during contact training sessions than in controlled, non-contact sessions. Older players are at the most risk for injuries, while teams with experienced coaches and more assistant coaches are less likely to experience injuries. Fifty percent of injuries <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower extremities (with knee injuries alone counting for roughly 36% of all injuries) and 30% <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper extremities.|$|E

5|$|Sea snakes do not <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean. It {{is thought}} that Pelamis would be found there {{were it not for}} the cold {{currents}} off Namibia and western South Africa that keep it from crossing into the eastern South Atlantic, or south of 5° latitude along the South American west coast. Sea snakes do not <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Red Sea, believed to be due to its increased salinity, so no danger exists of them crossing through the Suez Canal. A lack of salinity is also thought to be the reason why Pelamis has not crossed into the Caribbean via the Panama Canal.|$|E
5|$|Snow clouds usually <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{context of}} larger weather systems, the most {{important}} of which is the low pressure area, which typically incorporate warm and cold fronts as part of their circulation.
