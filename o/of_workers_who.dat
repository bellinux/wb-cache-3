5|$|By 1961, workers' basic wages {{had risen}} {{to an average of}} about 73 percent of their total {{earnings}}; piece-rate workers saw an average of 71 percent and time workers 76 percent of their earnings as their basic wage. There was also a reduction in the overall level of quota overfulfillment—with quotas raised, many could not meet their own personal quota. The proportion <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> achieved 100 percent or less of their quota varied from as low as 5.1 percent in iron and steel industries, to 31.4 percent in coal mining. Across Soviet industry, the average level of quota fulfillment fell from 169 percent before the reform, to 120 percent in October 1963.|$|E
5|$|In 1584, Virupaksha Pandita, {{the head}} priest at the Virupaksha Temple in Vijayanagara, wrote an account {{on the life}} and deeds of the 12th-century saint and vachana poet Chennabasava. The writing, titled Chenna Basava Purana, regards the protagonist as an {{incarnation}} of god Shiva and describes the glory of Shiva and his famous devotees. The book gives valuable information, including dates, about early Veerashaiva saints and vachanakaras (vachana poets). In addition to religious content, the writing provides useful insights about the former capital Vijayanagara, its royal palace, its market places and merchants, its military encampments, specialisations and divisions and the guilds <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> served the military in various capacities. Other authors from the 16th century were Chermanka (Chermanka Kavya), Virabhadraraja (Virabhadra Vijaya), Chennabasavanka (Mahadevi Akkanna Purana), Nanjunda of Ikkeri (Bhairavaesvara Kavya) and Sadasiva Yogi (Ramanatha Vilasa).|$|E

5|$|Villermé’s Tableau {{discussed}} {{the role of}} industrialization on the general health {{and quality of life}} for the laboring class. His perspective in this work is unique in that he maintained that the process of industrialization is not completely to blame. He even suggested the industrial movement to be beneficial for the future of society, calling on examples of industrialization in the United States. He also {{discussed the}} role of children working in the textile industry. The point is made that, in some cases, {{at least half of the}} workforce in a textile factory was made up of the children of textile workers, many under the age of eighteen. Villermé contrasted the quality of life <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> maintained family life with those taken over completely by their labor. He blamed both the working conditions associated with industrialization as well as the workers themselves to an extent. This work served not only as valuable information to medical institutions and boards, but also as a social statement, widely accepted by the public. It is from this work that Villermé received his reputation as a moral economist.|$|E

A National Labor Relations Board judge decided against the company and ordered it to recognize the vote.

25|$|Industry is {{the major}} employer, with most of it {{concentrated}} at the Pasteje facility. It {{was established in the}} 1960s and by the 1990s there were about fifty industrial enterprises employing over 7,000 people. Industry generates 94.54% of new employment in the municipality. Before the 1980s, about seventy percent of the municipality’s population was dedicated to agriculture. The major shift away from this occurred in the 1980s, because of the complex, but the trend continues. Eighty eight percent <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> are not self-employed work in manufacturing.

25|$|Until today Lebanon did {{not sign}} ILO {{convention}} No. 87, the Freedom of Association and Protection {{of the right}} to Organize, which states in Article 2 that no prior registration with government officials is needed to form a labour union. Article 86 of the Lebanese Labour Code however specifically states the need for authorization prior to trade union formation. Since there is no deadline for Ministry of Labour to either approve or disapprove the formation of a trade union the authorization process has been criticized to be depended on the political affiliation of the ministers of labour in charge. Article 4 of the Labour Law, and Decree No. 7993 of 1952 list domestic workers as one group <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> are barred from forming trade unions. Even though article 7 and article 92 allows foreigners to join a union, they are denied to vote for trade union representatives and being elected into such a position.|$|E

25|$|The union, {{faced with}} a {{challenge}} to its very existence, threatened to strike if the Mayor went through with this plan. With {{the support of the}} national CIO, the union was able to maintain its collective bargaining agreements and the right to represent the IRT and BMT employees after the City took over those systems in 1940. The union soon found itself struggling with the special problems of creating a civil service system for thousands of employees, while providing representation for thousands <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> faced problems with meeting the City's new naturalization and medical requirements. But the union lost ground among its members, both in terms of actual numbers after it lost the closed shop and in terms of actual support, since many workers who may have remained members saw the union as less important now that they had the seeming job security that civil service status promised and the union had lost the right to strike.|$|E

Edgar Kaiser, Henry's son, was in charge of the project. To smooth over relations with the workers (who had been treated poorly by their earlier employer), Hatch and Ordway persuaded Edgar to meet with Garfield, and in turn Edgar persuaded Garfield to tour the Grand Coulee site. Garfield subsequently agreed to reproduce at Grand Coulee Dam what he had done on the Colorado River Aqueduct project. He immediately spent $100,000 on renovating the decrepit Mason City Hospital and hired seven physicians.|$|E
25|$|Several labour-sending {{countries}} have issued travel bans or restrictions for Lebanon in recent years, among them Ethiopia, Nepal and the Philippines. However, the Lebanese {{government has been}} ineffective with implementing the migration workers ban from entering into Lebanon from the country of Nepal simply kept issuing pre-approved work permits and visas. Madagascar issued its Lebanon ban as {{a direct consequence of}} the death of 17 Madagascan domestic migrant workers in 2010 which in 2011 also led the Madagascar Government to fly out 86 domestic migrant worker. Ethiopian women have reportedly tried to bypass restrictions imposed by their government to work as domestic workers in Lebanon by first embarking on journeys to Sudan or Yemen. A figure presented by Anti-Slavery International explains the lack of proper implementation of the travel bans on migrant workers coming to Lebanon, as irregular channels of bringing the workers still operate. The figure in 2010 is 65%, this represents the amount <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> received their work permits {{despite the fact that they}} come from countries which are in the travel ban.|$|E
