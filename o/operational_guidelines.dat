By 15 May several special police units (SPUs) transferred to the ZNG, forming four brigades. By July the ZNG had approximately 8,000 troops and, unlike other Croatian forces, were fully equipped with small arms. The reserve police force, numbering about 39,000 in April, was also transferred to reserve ZNG brigades and independent battalions. On 18 May the Zrinski Battalion was established as a special forces unit of the ZNG, its core consisting of 27 volunteers drawn from the Kumrovec SPU. Initially, it also relied on former French Foreign Legion troops. By July, the reserve force of 40,000 ZNG troops was assigned to 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions; however, they did not possess sufficient heavy or small arms for all their personnel. The Croatian police had approximately 15,000 small arms, with less than 30,000 additional weapons obtained from abroad by August.|$|E

2500|$|The {{response}} of the Polish majority to the Jewish Holocaust covered an extremely wide spectrum, often ranging from acts of altruism {{at the risk of}} endangering their own and their families’ lives, through compassion, to passivity, indifference, and blackmail. Polish rescuers faced threats from unsympathetic neighbours, the Polish-German Volksdeutsche, the ethnic Ukrainian pro-Nazis, as well as blackmailers called szmalcowniks, along with the Jewish collaborators from Żagiew and Group 13. The Catholic saviors of Jews were also betrayed under duress by the Jews in hiding following capture by the military police, which resulted in the Nazi murder of the entire networks of Polish helpers. Holocaust testimonies confirm that, trapped in the ghettos, the Jewish criminal underworld took advantage of inside information about the socio-economic standing of their own compatriots. The Jewish looters knew better than anyone else [...] "where to dig for valuables" [...] wrote Isaiah Trunk and Rubin Katz. In 1941, the <b>operational</b> <b>guidelines</b> for the mass anti-Jewish actions to be carried out with the participation local gentiles were issued by Reinhard Heydrich at the onset of German-Soviet war. Massacres of Polish Jews by the Ukrainian and Lithuanian auxiliaries were committed in over 30 locations across formerly Soviet-occupied parts of Poland, including in Brześć, Tarnopol, Białystok, Łuck, Lwów, Stanisławów, and in Wilno where the Jews were murdered along with the Poles in the Ponary massacre at a ratio of 3-to-1. National minorities routinely participated in pogroms led by OUN-UPA, YB, TDA and BKA. Local participation in the Nazi German [...] "cleansing" [...] operations included the Jedwabne pogrom of 1941. The Einsatzkommandos were ordered to organize them in all eastern territories newly occupied by Nazi Germany. Nevertheless, statistics of the Israeli War Crimes Commission indicate that less than one tenth of 1 per cent of native Poles collaborated with the occupiers.|$|E

For a period of {{more than a year and}} a half, we have maintained a log of (1) the national changes to the immunization recommendations, (2) the local customizations of IMM/Serve's logic, and (3) certain logic problems that arose in the process of accommodating these changes and customizations. We describe the nature of these changes, customizations, and problems. We also discuss how different types of domain knowledge might assist in the automated process of validating successive versions of the logic. The paper's goal is to use the immunization domain to provide specific examples of the issues and problems that arise in maintaining a computer-based clinical guideline...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{the recent}} years, some {{domestic}} overflow and blowout events {{have shown that}} we can not apply conven-tional methods to successful well killing under some certain conditions, therefore, bullheading as an unconventional well killing can be considered. Bullheading by pumping kill fluid into wellbore makes the wellbore gas compressed so that bot-tomhole pressure exceeds formation pressure and gas leaks off to the formation. In this study, applicable conditions of bullheading have been discussed. Based on gas compressibility law and gas-liquid flow behavoir, bullheading operation is divided into three stages, including gas compression stage, gas seepage stage and gas-liquid seepage stage. The mathe-matical model for each stage is formulated to predict and interpret well killing mechanism. The calculated results showed good agreement with field case data. This paper might serve as an <b>operational</b> <b>guideline</b> during bullheading...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for {{appropriate}} water treatment technology for towns and small cities in developing countries. This study developed a pretreatment technology for highly turbid river water, called direct horizontal-flow roughing filtration, by combining the principles of direct filtration with roughing filtration process. A small amount of coagulant is added prior to a twocompartment horizontal roughing filter. The first compartment consists of large gravels and the second compartment of smaller •nes. This process produced good effluent quality and was versatile in handling wide fluctuations in raw water quality. The investment cost is about 25 - 35 % lower than for the conventional flocculation-sedimentation process. The dominant process mechanism in the first gravel bed compartment was sedimentation whereas the second compartment showed the characteristics of deep bed filtration. Investigations were carried out to optimize the process conditions. A design and <b>operational</b> <b>guideline</b> is proposed...|$|R

Pap smear test is the standard screening tool wherever the cyto-diagnostic facility exists. Visual Inspection with Acetic acid and Lugol’s Iodine will be the feasible alternative at low resource setting. Primary surgical treatment for early cervical cancer is the best option.

40|$|Abstract. The {{validity}} of the direct agglutination test (DAT) for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was studied with a standardized field kit on 148 clinically suspected persons and 176 healthy controls recruited between 1993 and 1994 from an endemic area in Gedaref State, Sudan. A sensitivity of 95. 9 % and a specificity of 99. 4 % were found at a 1 : 8, 000 cut-off titer when parasitologically confirmed cases were compared with healthy controls. While corroborating previously reported sensitivity and specificity estimates of this serodiagnostic test, {{this study examined the}} bias generated by commonly used test validation procedures. The fundamental methodologic problem in VL test validation is the absence of a reliable gold standard. Moreover, any <b>operational</b> <b>guideline</b> on DAT use has to consider the critical dependency of the predictive values of the test on VL prevalence rates. The DAT diagnostic cut-off titer depends upon many external factors, among which the prevalence of disease in the area and the case mix seem the most important. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a potentially fatal disease that affects an estimated 500, 000 persons per year. 1 Ninet...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} T/Gen, {{a prototype}} computer-based tool {{designed to help}} maintain the knowledge in a computer-based clinical practice guideline that provides patientspecific recommendations. T/Gen takes as input a set of clinical conditions to which a guideline must react, and allows the user to specify domain-specific constraints as to which combinations of conditions do not make sense or {{do not need to}} be exhaustively tested against one another. T/Gen automatically generates constrained sets of combinations of clinical conditions, each corresponding to a clinical case (or to several closely related clinical cases) that can be used to help test the computer-based guideline. The combinations can be used to test the guideline logic using T/Gen's built-in logic interpreter, or to generate a set of test cases for use in testing an <b>operational</b> <b>guideline</b> system.

This document presents the composting method as a suitable alternative for the treatment of solid waste in developing countries considering that its costs are not so high and that the composition of the solid waste is mainly organic. The analysis was based on a current literature review and on the study of some cases of composting projects, according to the results an <b>operational</b> <b>guideline</b> for the development of composting projects in developing countries was proposed.

Although some psychiatrists do {{think of themselves as}} chemists, the analogy is without warrant.

Although beginning with that third major revision of DSM a concerted effort has been made to ensure greater consistency in diagnoses, psychiatry remains beset by concerns that it is insufficiently scientific, unduly influenced by the pharmaceutical industry, indecisive as to whether it should focus on the mind or the brain, incapable of distinguishing among types of diseases, inclined to expand illness criteria without adequate justification, overly reliant on subjective judgments, wont to conflate clinical and ethical judgments, and engaged in indiscriminate use of psychoactive drugs.

40|$|Risk {{management}} of {{a supply chain}} (SC) has a great influence on the stability of dynamic cooperation among SC partners and hence {{very important for the}} performance of the SC operations as a whole. A suitable decision-making model is the cornerstone for the efficiency of SC risk management. We propose in this paper a decision-making model based on the internal triggering and interactive mechanisms in an SC risk system, which takes into account dual cycles, the operational process cycle (OPC) and the product life cycle (PLC). We explore the inter-relationship among the two cycles, SC organizational performance factors (OPF) and available risk operational practice (ROP), as well as the risk managerial elements in OPC and PLC. In particular, three types of relationship, bilateral, unilateral and inter-circulative ones, are analyzed and verified. We build this dynamic relation into SC risk managerial logic and design a corresponding decision-making path. Based on the analytic network process (ANP), a methodology is designed for an optimal selection of risk management methods and tools. A numerical example is provided as an <b>operational</b> <b>guideline</b> for how to apply it to tailor operational tactics in SC risk management. The results verify that this strategic decision model is a feasible access to the suitable risk operational tactics for practitioners. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
