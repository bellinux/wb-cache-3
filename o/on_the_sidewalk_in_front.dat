She cited graduation rates and college preparation as two reasons why the program had to go forward. The same day, students staged a walk-out in protest of the program.

25|$|Half of Flint's {{fourteen}} tallest {{buildings were}} built during the 1920s. The 19-story Genesee Towers, formerly the city's tallest building, {{was completed in}} 1968. The building became unused in later years and fell into severe disrepair: a cautionary sign warning of falling debris was put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of it. An investment company purchased the building for $1, and it was demolished (by implosion) on December 22, 2013.|$|E

25|$|The narrow axis of {{the plan}} faces {{the street to the}} east, and the main {{entrance}} lies midway along the long side of the plan. The use of hip roofs includes a very large cantilevered hip roof over the living room terrace. The pitch of the main hip roof is shallow enough to give the passer-by <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the house the impression that it is a flat roof.|$|E
25|$|On March 6, 1978, {{during a}} legal battle related to {{obscenity}} in Gwinnett County, Georgia, Flynt and his local lawyer, Gene Reeves Jr., were returning to the courthouse when they were shot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of 136 South Perry Street in Lawrenceville by a sniper standing near an alley across the street. The shooting left Flynt partially paralyzed with permanent spinal cord damage, {{and in need of}} a wheelchair. Flynt's injuries caused him constant, excruciating pain and he was addicted to painkillers until multiple surgeries deadened the affected nerves. He also suffered a stroke caused by one of several overdoses of his analgesic medications. He recovered but has had pronunciation difficulties since.|$|E

50|$|Some laws {{prohibit}} bicycle {{riding in}} commercial areas, such as <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> front of stores. In other places a sign erected {{by a government}} must be followed, such as with no-riding zones in a college campus.|$|R
500|$|In July 1937, the Williams and McNeil {{families}} {{opened a}} boarding house on South Perry Street in downtown Montgomery. It {{was at this}} time that Williams decided to change his name informally from Hiram to Hank, a name he said was better suited to his desired career in country music. During the same year he participated in a talent show at the Empire Theater. He won the first prize of $15, singing his first original song [...] "WPA Blues". Williams wrote the lyrics and used the tune of Riley Puckett's [...] "Dissatisfied." [...] He never learned to read music and, {{for the rest of his}} career, based his compositions in storytelling. After school and on weekends Williams sang and played his Silvertone guitar <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the WSFA radio studios. His recent win at the Empire Theater and the street performances caught the attention of WSFA producers who occasionally invited him to perform on air. So many listeners contacted the radio station asking for more of [...] "the singing kid" [...] that the producers hired him to host his own 15-minute show twice a week for a weekly salary of US$15 (equivalent to US$0 in [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|From {{even its}} early days, {{students}} were {{no stranger to}} protest. [...] In May 1913, in retaliation for what students claimed were [...] "harsh methods", an effigy of the principal, J.E. Witmer, was hung from the telegraph wires {{in front of the}} school. [...] After the principal removed the effigy in the early evening, another was hung from the flagpole on top of the school. [...] When signs were found painted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the school the next day, the local marshal took every male in the senior class into custody, ordering them to remove the signs under threat of arrest. [...] The next year, 110 students walked out on strike when the principal refused to grant a holiday for Columbus Day.|$|E

50|$|Mr Ningle {{has been}} living a lie for seven years by pretending to still be {{commuting}} to his financial services job in the City of London from {{which he had been}} sacked.

50|$|The {{pedestrian}} scramble {{may be used}} {{where large}} numbers of pedestrians are expected, and they will also have enough space to gather <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> larger numbers. Under certain circumstances, pedestrian scrambles could reduce safety, as the average waiting times for pedestrians and car drivers are increased, thus creating more likelihood of people disobeying the signals.|$|R
60|$|He was {{too excited}} to notice {{carefully}} {{where he was}} running, and the next instant he, followed by Glutts, brought up against a stand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a small shop.

6000|$|Fillmore {{was himself}} again. We {{all have our}} {{particular}} mode of self-expression in moments of elation. Fillmore's took the shape of buying a new waistcoat and a hundred half-dollar cigars and being very fussy {{about what he had}} for lunch. It may have been an optical illusion, but he appeared to Sally to put on at least six pounds in weight {{on the first day of}} the new regime. As a serf looking after paper-knives and other properties, he had been--for him--almost slim.

6000|$|Rollo {{felt very}} much perplexed. When he pictured to himself, in imagination, {{the idea of}} being whirled rapidly through the Boulevards, on such a {{pleasant}} summer evening, in a carriage which he should have all to himself, with the top down so that he could see every thing all around him, and of the brilliant windows of the shops, the multitudes of ladies and gentlemen taking their coffee at the little round tables <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the coffee saloons, the crowds of people coming and going, and the horsemen and carriages thronging the streets, the view was so enchanting that it was very hard for him to give up the promised pleasure.

60|$|One bright {{afternoon}} Keller stood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the store. He was not old, but {{his hair}} was gray {{and his face was}} pinched. It was rather a hard face, for Keller's glance was keen and his lips were generally firmly set. Yet he was liked by his customers. Now he was breathing hard because he had helped a farmer to put a heavy bag of flour in his wagon. The farmer drove away and a cloud of dust the team stirred up blew down the street. The fronts of the wooden houses were cracking in the hot sun; there was not a tree to relieve the bare ugliness of the place, and the glare was dazzling. Keller at first imagined this was why he could not see the wagon well, but after a few moments he knew better.|$|E

It was a night of terror. I did not sleep a wink. A man--why and how I do not know--was killed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the house. I heard the rapid reports of an automatic pistol, and a few minutes later the wounded wretch crawled up to my door, moaning and crying out for help. Arming myself with two automatics, I went to him. By the light of a match I ascertained that while he was dying of the bullet wounds, {{at the same time the}} plague was on him. I fled indoors, whence I heard him moan and cry out for half an hour longer.|$|E

I figured out a scheme to catch the West Indies and South American trade.

I got a Spanish-speaking force of employees and a string band; and there was talk going round of a cockfight in the basement every Sunday. Maybe I didn't catch the nut-brown gang!
