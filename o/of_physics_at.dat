5|$|He was Director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, {{which he}} helped to found with Ernest O. Lawrence, from 1958 to 1960, and after that he {{continued}} as an Associate Director. He chaired the committee that founded the Space Sciences Laboratory at Berkeley. He also served concurrently as a Professor <b>of</b> <b>Physics</b> <b>at</b> the University of California, Berkeley. He was a tireless advocate of a strong nuclear program and argued for continued testing and development—in fact, he {{stepped down from the}} directorship of Livermore so that he could better lobby against the proposed test ban. He testified against the test ban both before Congress as well as on television.|$|E

She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965. Goeppert Mayer died in San Diego, California, on February 20, 1972, after a heart attack that had struck her the previous year left her comatose. She was buried at El Camino Memorial Park in San Diego.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, paleontologists David M. Raup and Jack Sepkoski {{suggested}} that extinction events on Earth followed a periodic trend.

The laboratory was so antiquated that it still ran on direct current electricity, but Chadwick seized the opportunity, assuming the chair on 1 October 1935. The university's prestige was soon bolstered by Chadwick's Nobel Prize, which was announced in November 1935. His medal was sold at auction in 2014 for $329,000.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence {{was hired}} as an {{associate}} professor <b>of</b> <b>physics</b> <b>at</b> the University of California in 1928, {{and two years later}} became a full professor, becoming the university's youngest professor.

Through this club, Lawrence met William Henry Crocker, Edwin Pauley, and John Francis Neylan. They were influential men who helped him obtain money for his energetic nuclear particle investigations. There was great hope for medical uses to come from the development of particle physics, and this led to much of the early funding for advances Lawrence was able to obtain.|$|E
