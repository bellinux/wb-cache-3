2500|$|... "The {{southern}} tribal hinterland of Baha—home to {{especially the}} Al-Ghamdi and Al-Zahrani tribes—has been renowned for centuries for their tribal cemeteries {{that are now}} slowly vanishing, according to Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper... One old villager explained how tribal cemeteries came about. “People used to die in large numbers and very rapidly {{one after the other}} because of diseases. So the villagers would dig graves close by burying members of the same family in one area. That was how the family and tribal burial grounds came about,” he said. The old man continued, “If the family ran out of space, they would open old graves where family members had been buried before and add more people to them. This process is known as khashf.” During famines and outbreaks of epidemics huge numbers of people would die and many tribes faced difficulties in digging new graves because of the difficult weather. Elderly people remember that in olden times, the winter used to stretch for more than six months and would be accompanied with lots of rain and fog making movement difficult. But due to tribal rivalries many families would guard their cemeteries and put restrictions on who got buried in them. Across Baha burial grounds are constructed in different ways. Some cemeteries consist of underground vaults or concrete burial chambers with the capacity of holding a large number of bodies at a time. Such vaults include windows for people to peer through and are usually decorated ornately with writings, drawings and patterns. Muhammad Saleh, a local resident, said, “One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> so iconic about many of these graves is {{the fact that many of}} them are not directed toward the Kaaba. This tells us that some of these graves are from the pre-Islamic era. In Islam the face of a dead person should be toward the Kaaba.”" ...|$|E

5000|$|After two years, the {{international}} geoscience community including experts from Japan, Canada, United States, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, Hong Kong, UK, Taiwan and the Philippines, {{came together in}} Tacloban and St. Bernard to examine known information on the Guinsaugon disaster. In addition, the workshop was tasked with determining the next steps as Leyte and the Philippines move forward from the world's deadliest single-event landslide since 1998. The landslide is classified as a rock slide-debris avalanche using the Varnes (1978) or Cruden and Varnes (1996) classification. Volume estimates in recent publications range between 14 MCM (million cubic metres) and 20 MCM, converging on or about 15 MCM. There is general accord among scientists that high precipitation a week prior to the failure contributed to the conditions at failure, but the 5 day delay between {{the rain and the}} landslide, and the fact that Southern Leyte regularly gets high overall levels of precipitation means that the precise nature of that contribution is unknown. Similarly, the role of minor ground shaking that occurred {{at about the same time}} is still uncertain. [...] "Was the landslide caused by ground shaking or excessive rain? This is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not yet resolved." [...] said Dr. Mark Albert Zarco, a professor at the Department of Engineering Sciences, University of the Philippines Diliman in a news story. Importantly, the geological and geomorphological history of the slope including, for example, the prominent strike-slip movement of about 2.5 cm per year, has ultimately lead to failures all along the scarp, including the one that buried Guinsaugon. Richard Guthrie, of University of Waterloo, Canada, stated: [...] "We have had very large rains and we have had very large earthquakes in the past; The rocks have been stretched and strained. As time moves on, the rock begins to age and die and finally it collapses. The important thing is that we’re able to know the preconditioning of the slopes." [...] Scientists are currently building a synthesis paper on the landslide and a set of recommendations regarding the next steps for the Philippines in relation to landslide hazards.There was also a minor earthquake in the area measuring 2.6 which would have contributed to the landslide.|$|E

40|$|Watersheds are {{excellent}} resource {{planning and management}} tools and can provide meaning to archaeological data collected within and between watershed boundaries. In this paper we will discuss the watershed model used by the Bureau for Historic Preservation and its possible utility in helping to ascribe time period affiliation to what have otherwise been thought to be undatable prehistoric sites. We present two examples from the CRM literature, one from West Virginia where this was done on a local level, and a second from Pennsylvania in {{a section of the}} Susquehanna West Branch. To make our definitions clear, a watershed is defined here as a drainage basin or catchment area based on Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection mapping (Figure 1). These drainage basins divide Pennsylvania by major river systems, then by 20 smaller tributary drainages, and finally by minor tributaries of which there are 104.

We show that such proofs may be carried out in polynomial workspace. Key words: Integer programming, cutting planes. The integer programming problem is to decide if a given system of linear inequalities has an integral solution. Recent progress on this algorithmic question has involved techniques from the geometry of numbers, in the celebrated paper of Lenstra [20] and in results of Babai [1], Gr 6 tschel, Lovfisz and Schrijver [14] and Kannan [16]. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> apparent in these results is the importance of the fact that if a polyhedron contains no integral vectors then there must be some direction in which it is not very 'wide'. This idea has been developed more fully by Kannan and Lovfisz [17], who obtained a theorem which provides much more information on the appearance of such polyhedra. These 'width ' results have consequences for the construction and analysis of proof systems for verifying that a polyhedron contains no integral vectors.
