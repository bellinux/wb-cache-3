40|$|Over {{the period}} 1997 to 2000, the Australian {{government}} introduced two waves of price subsidies, then liberalised regulation to encourage private health insurance.

5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon {{monoxide}} {{at one of these}} sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E

5|$|Like most amines, {{dopamine}} is {{an organic}} base. As a base, {{it is generally}} protonated in acidic environments (in an acid-base reaction). The protonated form is highly water-soluble and relatively stable, but can become oxidized if exposed to oxygen or other oxidants. In basic environments, dopamine is not protonated. In this free base form, it is less water-soluble and also more highly reactive. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> stability and water-solubility of the protonated form, dopamine is supplied for chemical or pharmaceutical use as dopamine hydrochloride—that is, the hydrochloride salt that is created when dopamine is combined with hydrochloric acid. In dry form, dopamine hydrochloride is a fine colorless powder.|$|E

WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans to try to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC found that this was in breach of WCRC's Safety Management System. WCRC chairman David Smith instructed his staff that no further correspondence would be gone into over the matter. The ADC found that this instruction was prejudicial to the safe operation of WCRC's Safety Management System. The instruction was later rescinded.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1907, U.S. naval and {{military}} planners {{had concluded that}} it would be impractical to repel an invasion of the Philippines. The best that could be hoped for was that the garrison could hold out on the Bataan peninsula until help arrived. In the 1920s it was estimated that they could do so for about 60 days. By the 1930s, the planners had become decidedly pessimistic in view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> capability of aircraft, and by 1936 they were agreed that the Philippine should be written off. But in July 1941, this decision was abruptly reversed, and it became the policy of the U.S. government to defend and hold the Philippines. This was based, at least in part, in the belief that Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers could deter or defeat an invading force.|$|E

40|$|We {{document}} {{changes in}} <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> earnings during <b>the</b> economic transition in Poland. We find that inequality in labor earnings increased substantially from 1988 to 1996. A common {{view is that}} <b>the</b> reallocation <b>of</b> workers from a public sector with a compressed wage distribution, to a private sector with much higher wage inequality, accounts for <b>the</b> bulk <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> earnings inequality during transition. However, our decomposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in inequality suggests that this compositional effect accounts for only 39 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase.</b> Fully 52 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> is due to <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in <b>the</b> variance <b>of</b> wages within sectors. That is, earnings inequality within both {{the private and public}} sectors grew substantially, and by similar amounts. This illustrates how even state-owned enterprises in Poland moved towards competitive wage setting as they restructured. A substantial part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in earnings inequality was between group, due largely to increased education premia. However, changes in inequality within education-experiencegender groups account for about 60 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in overall wage inequality [...] similar to the patterns observed in the U. S. and U. K. in the 1980 s. But, in contrast to the U. S. and U. K. experiences, increases in within-group inequality in Poland were very different across skill groups, with much larger increases for highly educated workers. These patterns hold in both the private and public sectors, although increases in education premia were somewhat greater in the private sector...|$|R
