40|$|This project {{deals with}} {{the extent to which}} the role <b>of</b> the <b>civil</b> servant in the centraladministration is {{challenged}} today and whether the Eritrea case is an example of the challenges in the role. The progress of the project is based on the following issue: To what extent is the role <b>of</b> the <b>civil</b> servant in the centraladministration challenged today and how is the Eritrea case an example of this? At the macro level we demonstrate the historical development of the role <b>of</b> the <b>civil</b> servant in the form of archeological layers. Our focus is on the progression of the role <b>of</b> the <b>civil</b> servant in the centraladministration. We analyze from a New Public Manage-ment perspective to identify key factors that has influenced the role. Furthermore we briefly analyze that the role <b>of</b> the <b>civil</b> servant is dependant on what structure and culture exists in a given organization. At the meso level, the role <b>of</b> the <b>civil</b> servant is analyzed in relation to their ministerial service. The challenges to the role is problematized through fundamental norms and obligations. The Christiania case exemplifies the relationship between the minister and top-executive and how the various expectations and duties conflict. Next we analyze how a politicization <b>of</b> the <b>civil</b> service generally is reflected. At the micro level, we analyze how the Eritrea case challenges the role of the minor official. Simultaneously we problematize the effects of when politics trumps professional service and if the Eritrea case to that extent has been politically commissioned /instructed work. Lastly we conclude that the ideal notion of the role <b>of</b> the <b>civil</b> servant has radically changed. The politicization <b>of</b> the <b>civil</b> service challenges the role <b>of</b> the <b>civil</b> servant and the Eritrea case shows that a clear distinction between politics and administration is an idealized picture...|$|R
