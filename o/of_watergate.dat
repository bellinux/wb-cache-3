5|$|On December 8, 1972, United Airlines Flight 553, a Boeing 737-200, {{crashed into}} a {{residential}} area outside Midway during landing. The crash of the 737-200 killed 43 of the 61 on board, and two on the ground. One of the victims on the plane was Dorothy Hunt, the wife <b>of</b> <b>Watergate</b> conspirator E. Howard Hunt. She was carrying $10,000 in cash. James McCord alleged that she supplied the Watergate defendants with money for legal expenses.|$|E
5|$|Historian Keith W. Olson {{has written}} that Nixon left a {{negative}} legacy: fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in Vietnam and Watergate. During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct had been comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far more serious {{than those of the}} incumbent. Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease {{in the power of the}} presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake <b>of</b> <b>Watergate.</b> Olson suggests that grants of power to George W. Bush in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks restored the president's power.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} <b>of</b> <b>Watergate,</b> the Ford administration {{was engaged in}} a number of conflicts with Congress. Scalia repeatedly testified before congressional committees, defending Ford administration assertions of executive privilege regarding its refusal to turn over documents. Within the administration, Scalia advocated a presidential veto for a bill to amend the Freedom of Information Act, which would greatly increase the act's scope. Scalia's view prevailed, and Ford vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode it. In early 1976, Scalia argued his only case before the Supreme Court, Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba. Scalia, on behalf of the US government, argued in support of Dunhill, and that position was successful.|$|E

25|$|Conditions worsened in the mid-1970s, {{around the}} time <b>of</b> <b>Watergate.</b> A {{dominant}} feature of political life during that period were the attempts of Congress to assert oversight of the U.S. Presidency and {{the executive branch of}} the U.S. government. Revelations about past CIA activities, such as assassinations and attempted assassinations of foreign leaders (most notably Fidel Castro and Rafael Trujillo) and illegal domestic spying on U.S. citizens, provided the opportunities to increase Congressional oversight of U.S. intelligence operations.|$|E

25|$|The two-year {{war between}} the ABA and the USBA was perhaps the ugliest rivalry that BMX has ever saw. It seems the USBA was making most of the {{aggressive}} moves. The motivation for rivalries like this was the $2 million to $4 million in revenue yearly that BMX generated at the time. Compared to other older more established sports like baseball, European football (soccer), American football and auto racing, this was a pittance but still enough to generate bad promoters and political infighting between and within sanctioning bodies. Track operators had quite thin profit margins to work with, which perhaps made the back biting even worse since there was so little to go around. There was a slump in the BMX racing market as mentioned {{with the growth of}} Freestyle, the resurgence of skateboarding siphoning off young people and the insurance crises to drain resources further. Pretty desperate times for the organizers of BMX racing, and desperate times generate desperate acts, including actions straight out <b>of</b> <b>Watergate.</b>|$|E

500|$|During the Georgian era more {{sections}} of the Rows were blocked, especially by commercial development {{on the north side}} <b>of</b> <b>Watergate</b> Street. [...] In 1808 Thomas Harrison designed the Commercial Coffee Room in Northgate Street in neoclassical style, with an arcade at the ground-floor level, rather than continuing the Row on the first floor. [...] In 1859–60 Chester Bank was built in Eastgate Street, again obliterating its part of the Row. [...] However other architects continued the tradition of maintaining the Rows in their designs; examples include the Georgian Booth Mansion of 1700 in Watergate Street, T. M. Penson's Gothic Revival Crypt Chambers of 1858 in Eastgate Street, and buildings in modern style constructed in Watergate Street in the 1960s.|$|E

500|$|Critics such as Neil Sinyard have {{described}} similarities to Henrik Ibsen's play An Enemy of the People. Gottlieb himself {{said he and}} Spielberg referred to Jaws as [...] "Moby-Dick meets Enemy of the People". [...] The Ibsen work features a doctor who discovers that a seaside town's medicinal hot springs, a major tourist attraction and revenue source, are contaminated. When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in Jaws by Brody's conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge {{the presence of a}} shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a [...] "deft combination <b>of</b> <b>Watergate</b> and Ibsen's play".|$|E
500|$|California native Chris Carter {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to produce new shows for the Fox network in the early 1990s. Tired of the comedies he had been working on for Walt Disney Pictures, inspired by a report that 3.7 million Americans may have been abducted by aliens, and recalling memories <b>of</b> <b>Watergate</b> and the 1970s horror series , Carter {{came up with the idea}} for The X-Files and wrote the pilot episode himself in 1992. He initially struggled over the untested concept—executives wanted a love interest for Scully—and casting. The network wanted either a more established or a [...] "taller, leggier, blonder and breastier" [...] actress for Scully than the 24-year-old Gillian Anderson, a theater veteran with minor film experience, who Carter felt was the only choice after auditions.|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{directly}} {{requested that}} his aides use government records {{to try to}} dig up dirt on McGovern and his top contributors. McGovern was publicly attacked by Nixon surrogates and {{was the target of}} various operations of the Nixon [...] "dirty tricks" [...] campaign. The infamous Watergate break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in June 1972 was an alternate target after bugging McGovern's headquarters was explored. The full dimensions of the subsequent Watergate scandal did not emerge during the election, however; {{the vast majority of the}} press focused on McGovern's difficulties and other news, rather than the break-in or who was behind it, and a majority of voters were unaware <b>of</b> <b>Watergate.</b> [...] In the end, Nixon's covert operations had little effect in either direction on the election outcome.|$|E

500|$|Nixon saw his {{policies}} regarding Vietnam, China, and the Soviets as {{key to his}} place in history.

With the exception of his inexcusable continuation {{of the war in}} Vietnam, Nixon really will get high marks in history." [...] Political scientist Jussi Hanhimäki disagrees, saying Nixon's diplomacy was merely a continuation of the Cold War policy of containment, using diplomatic rather than military means. Historian Christopher Andrew concludes that [...] "Nixon was a great statesman on the world stage as well as a shabby practitioner of electoral politics in the domestic arena. While the criminal farce <b>of</b> <b>Watergate</b> was in the making, Nixon's inspirational statesmanship was establishing new working relationships with both Communist China and the Soviet Union." ...|$|E

The floors above the level of the Rows are used for commercial or domestic purposes, or for storage. [...] The Rows are present, to a greater or lesser degree, in all the streets radiating from Chester Cross, namely Watergate Street, Northgate Street, Eastgate Street and Upper Bridge Street. [...] They are continuous on both sides of Upper Bridge Street, along most <b>of</b> <b>Watergate</b> and Eastgate Street, but only for a short stretch along the east side of Northgate Street. [...] Originally there were also Rows in Lower Bridge Street but these were blocked during the 17th and 18thcenturies.|$|E
