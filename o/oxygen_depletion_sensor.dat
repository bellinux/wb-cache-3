40|$|Abstract: <b>Oxygen</b> <b>depletion</b> {{leading to}} a summer anoxia in subpycnocline waters of the {{mesohaline}} reach of Chesapeake Bay has been an annual event {{for at least five}} decades. It is generally assumed that the spatial and temporal extent of bottom water anoxia has increased in response to higher phytoplankton productivity due to anthropogenic nutrient loading. However, synoptic observations of environmental conditions (river flow, tem-perature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients) and phytoplankton from 1984 to 1988 indicate that <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion</b> is ot related to phytoplankton productivity on seasonal to interannual scales. Rather, nutrient loading is linked to <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion</b> and summer anoxia via the spring accumulation of phytoplankton biomass which is more than sufficient to fuel <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion.</b> Thus, interannual variability in the magnitude of summer anoxia is primarily driven by climatic factors which govern vertical density stratification (mixing). Marine systems appear to be more responsive to climatic variability than are terrestrial systems (Steele 1985). The variability of freshwater run-off on seasonal to interannual scales is an im-portant expression of climatic variability which has major impacts on trophic dynamics and water quality of coastal ecosystems (Sutcliff...|$|R

40|$|<b>Oxygen</b> <b>depletion</b> {{in coastal}} and estuarine waters has been {{increasing}} rapidly around the globe {{over the past several}} decades, leading to decline in water quality and ecological health. In this study we apply a numerical model to understand how salt wedge dynamics, changes in river flow and temperature together control <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion</b> in a micro-tidal riverine estuary, the Yarra River estuary, Australia. Coupled physical–biogeochemical models have been previously applied to study how hydrodynamics impact upon seasonal hypoxia; however, their application to relatively shallow, narrow riverine estuaries with highly transient patterns of river inputs and sporadic periods of <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion</b> has remained challenging, largely due to difficulty in accurately simulating salt wedge dynamics in morphologically complex areas. In this study we overcome this issue through application of a flexible mesh 3 -D hydrodynamic–biogeochemical model in order to predict the extent of salt wedge intrusion and consequent patterns of <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion.</b> The extent of the salt wedge responded quickly to the sporadic riverine flows, with the strength of stratification and vertical density gradients heavily influenced by morphological features corresponding to shallow points in regions of tight curvature ("horseshoe" bends). The spatiotemporal patterns of stratification led to the emergence of two "hot spots" of anoxia, the first downstream of a shallow region of tight curvature and the second downstream of a sill. Whilst these areas corresponded to regions of intense stratification, it was found that antecedent conditions related to the placement of the salt wedge {{played a major role in}} the recovery of anoxic regions following episodic high flow events. Furthermore, whilst a threshold salt wedge intrusion was a requirement for <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion,</b> analysis of the results allowed us to quantify the effect of temperature in determining the overall severity and extent of hypoxia and anoxia. Climate warming scenarios highlighted that <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion</b> is likely to be exacerbated through changes in flow regimes and warming temperatures; however, the increasing risk of hypoxia and anoxia can be mitigated through management of minimum flow allocations and targeted reductions in organic matter loading. A simple statistical model (R 2 > 0. 65) is suggested to relate riverine flow and temperature to the extent of estuary-wide anoxia...|$|R
40|$|<b>Oxygen</b> <b>depletion</b> in {{estuarine waters}} is an {{important}} factor governing water quality and ecological health. A complex and dynamic balance of physical and biogeochemical factors drive the extent and persistence of hypoxia and anoxia making it difficult to predict. An increased understanding of the effect of changing flow regimes and temperature on patterns of estuarine <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion</b> is required to support ongoing management. Coupled physical and biogeochemical models have been applied to study the interaction of physical processes and seasonal hypoxia, however, application to riverine estuaries with tight curvature and more sporadic periods of <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion</b> is rare. In this study we apply a finite volume 3 -D hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model (TUFLOW-FV–FABM) to the Yarra River estuary, Australia, in order to predict the extent of salt-wedge intrusion and consequent patterns of <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion.</b> The predictive capacity of the model was evaluated using a series of model verification metrics and the results evaluated to determine the dominant mechanisms affecting salt-wedge position and the extent and persistence of anoxia and hypoxia. Measures of model fit indicated that the model reasonably captured the strength of stratification and the position and extent of the salt wedge (r 2 ~ 0. 74). The extent of the salt wedge intrusion was controlled by riverine flow and the strength of stratification or mixing dominated by topographical features corresponding to areas of tight curvature ("horseshoe" bends). The model predicted that the extent of anoxic waters generally mimicked the extent of the salt wedge (r 2 ~ 0. 65) increasing during periods of low flow and reduced following episodic high flow events. The results showed two sporadically isolated "hot spots" of anoxia, the first downstream of the horseshoe bend and the second downstream of a sill. Simulated oxygen concentrations indicated that whilst a threshold salt wedge intrusion was a requirement of <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion,</b> temperature was critical in determining the extent of hypoxia and anoxia in the estuary. These findings highlight the importance of how seasonal changes in flow events and environmental flow management can impact on estuarine <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion</b> in a warming climate. This study provides an improved understanding of the controls on hypoxia and anoxia in riverine estuaries, which is essential to support improved prediction of nutrient dynamics and ecological heath...|$|R

30|$|Hypoxia and anoxia {{generally}} {{occur in}} near-bottom waters of coastal zones and estuaries, {{and are often}} associated with eutrophication, microbial respiration, and <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion</b> (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008). In severe cases, such <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion</b> may lead to 'dead zones’ where mass mortalities of benthic organisms occur. Nutrient runoff into aquatic environments can stimulate plant growth and lead to algal blooms (Justic et al. 1993).

40|$|<b>Oxygen</b> <b>depletion</b> occurs {{primarily}} {{during the}} summer in {{over half of the}} major estuaries in the United States. Its duration and extent range from a few weeks and limited areas to several months and expansive areas. Because the physics of some estuarine and coastal systems isolate the bottom waters from interaction with the atmosphere they become susceptible to oxygen depletion; however, human activities increase the likelihood of the phenomenon. Evidence associates <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion</b> with changes in landscape use and nutrient management that result in nutrient enrichment of receiving waters. Increases in nutrient inputs clearly and directly relate to population density in watersheds draining to coastal areas, and population-driven increases in nutrient loading are causing problems in the form of <b>oxygen</b> <b>depletion,</b> habitat loss, fish kills and the frequency of harmful algal blooms.
