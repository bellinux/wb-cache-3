5|$|A soundtrack album {{featuring}} the original {{music from the}} series, composed and conducted by Mark Russell was released on 15 June 2009 and is only available through the iTunes Store at the moment. The album mainly contains music from the third series although some <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> used earlier in the series.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{inconsistent}} {{nature of}} {{the record of the}} action, contemporary and historical coverage <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> easily colored by preferences for one account over another. Francis Parkman, for example, accepted Washington's account, and was highly dismissive of the accounts by Monceau and the Indian.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have had}} a long history of contact with humans, but most <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> to the {{detriment}} of fisher populations. Unprovoked attacks on humans are extremely rare, but fishers will attack if they feel threatened or cornered. In one case, a fisher was blamed for an attack on a six-year-old boy. In another case, a fisher is believed to be responsible for an attack on a twelve-year-old boy.|$|E

5|$|Pope Gregory's {{plan had}} been that York would be England's second {{metropolitan}} see, so Paulinus established his church there. Although built of stone, no trace <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> found. Paulinus also built a number of churches on royal estates. His church in Lincoln has been identified with the earliest building phase {{of the church of}} St Paul in the Bail.|$|E
5|$|Another {{earthquake}} {{struck in}} 1202, {{and it may}} have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no trace <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> discovered.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1130s England began to descend into {{a period of}} civil war known as the Anarchy, during which the {{supporters}} of King Stephen fought {{with those of the}} Empress Matilda for control of the kingdom. William de Mohun's eldest son, also called William, was a noted supporter of Matilda, and Dunster was considered one of her faction's strongest castles in the south-west. In 1138 forces loyal to Stephen besieged the castle; a siege castle was built nearby, but all trace <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> lost. William successfully held the castle and was made the Earl of Somerset by the grateful Empress. Chroniclers subsequently complained {{of the way in which}} he subsequently raided and controlled the region by force during the war, causing much destruction. In the aftermath of the conflict, William's son, another William, inherited the castle after a short period of royal ownership under Henry II. William appears to have insisted that his tenants agree to help repair and maintain the castle walls as part of their feudal service.|$|E

50|$|However, Andrea Cau has informally noted {{a number}} of points in the fossil that <b>are</b> {{indicative}} <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> artificially assembled, thus rendering the specimen a phylogenetically uninformative chimaera.|$|R

25|$|The Chuci material, or {{at least}} some <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a major {{influence}} on Classical Chinese poetry. It has also been translated into a number of other languages, including English, which has extended its influence even further.|$|E

25|$|Careniup Swamp, the wetland {{which gave}} {{its name to}} nearby Karrinyup, was {{formerly}} bounded by Gribble Road, Balcatta Road, North Beach Road and the freeway.

25|$|Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher, {{designed}} in 1993 by Bruce Schneier and {{included in a}} large number of cipher suites and encryption products.

However, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) now receives more attention.|$|E
25|$|Much {{sophisticated}} and important thought {{has taken place}} after the writing of Marx and Engels; much or perhaps even all <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> influenced, subtly or overtly, by Marxism. Simply dismissing all philosophy as sophistry might condemn Marxism to a simplistic empiricism or economism, crippling it in practice and making it comically simplistic {{at the level of}} theory.|$|E
50|$|A royal palace <b>is</b> {{supposed}} to <b>have</b> existed in Menmuir in {{the reign of}} Alexander III, {{a little to the}} south-west of where the church now stands. However, no remains <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found.|$|R
50|$|Hypohippus ("Low horse") is an extinct genus of three-toed horse, which lived 17-11 {{million years}} ago. It {{was the size}} of a pony, and fossils <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found in Nebraska, Colorado, and Montana.|$|R
25|$|The {{outbreaks}} of dancing mania varied, and several characteristics <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> recorded. Generally occurring {{in times of}} hardship, up {{to tens of thousands}} of people would appear to dance for hours, days, weeks, and even months.|$|R
25|$|Lambrick {{estimated}} {{that when it}} was originally erected, the King Stone would have weighed somewhere {{in the region of}} 4.7 tonnes, but that since then much <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> chipped away. Using his own estimates, Lambrick suggested that with a team of 58 workers, the King Stone could have been set up in about two hours.|$|E
25|$|In 1903 another hospice for Russian pilgrims was built, the Nikolai Pilgrims Hospice, {{which was}} {{large enough to}} hold 1,200 guests. Since the British Mandate period part <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> used as police {{headquarters}} and as government offices. Later it was the British intelligence headquarters, blown up twice by the Jewish underground organisation Irgun under Menachem Begin in 1945.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there has}} been {{evidence}} found of a prior indigenous peoples presence along the Richelieu River, none <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> found on the territory of Beloeil. Development of {{the region in the}} first several decades after the arrival of Europeans in the region was slow, owing to the geographic situation of the Richelieu, which made it a primary avenue of attack from New York toward New France.|$|E
30|$|The Lotka–Volterra model, {{proposed}} by Lotka [1] and Volterra [2], {{is used to}} describe the evolutionary process in population dynamics, physics, and economics.

25|$|In 1847, the Russian {{ambassador}} to Tehran, Prince Dimitri Ivanovich Dolgorukov, and other diplomats {{became aware of}} the claims of the Báb and seeing the fleeing of Bábís across the border requested that the Báb, then imprisoned at Maku, be moved elsewhere; he also condemned the massacres of Iranian religionists. Dolgorukov wrote some memoirs later in life but much <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> shown to be a forgery. But his dispatches show that he was afraid of the movement spreading into the Caucasus.|$|E
25|$|Several live {{recordings}} of Giovanna d'Arco have been released. However, only one studio recording <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> made: James Levine's 1972 version with Montserrat Caballé, Plácido Domingo, and Sherrill Milnes. Domingo again {{appeared in a}} more recent, live recording of the opera in 2013 with Anna Netrebko. Originally singing the tenor role of Carlo, he sang the baritone role of Giacomo in this newer version. Unusually for an operatic album, this later recording reached the #38 spot on the Danish albums chart in 2014.|$|E
25|$|The stone {{allegedly}} {{was discovered}} in 1833 by Mongkut, {{at the time a}} bhikkhu (Buddhist monk), in Wat Mahathat, Sukhothai. The authenticity of the stoneor at least portions <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> called into question. Piriya Krairiksh, an academic at the Thai Khadi Research Institute, noted that the stele's treatment of vowels suggests that its creators had been influenced by European alphabet systems. He concluded that the stele was fabricated by someone during the reign of King Mongkut or shortly before. The subject is controversial, since if the stone is a fake, the entire history of the period will have to be re-written.|$|E
50|$|Despite much <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> {{destroyed}} {{during the}} 20th century, {{the remains of}} three fundamental parts of the structure are still visible; the cavea (seating), the orchestra and the scaena.

50|$|A {{number of}} Orders in Council with this title, and {{variations}} <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> passed.
