But he says pessimism {{is not the same}} thing as fatalism, and Hamilton believes there is still an urgent need for government intervention to avoid worst-case scenarios by reducing emissions. Munro also points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> eminent climate scientists, like Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, remain optimistic that humanity will act before it is too late.|$|E

The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed {{it has long been}} the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4. But in 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.|$|E

25|$|The play is also full of {{constraint}} imagery. Hamlet describes Denmark as a prison, {{and himself}} as {{being caught in}} birdlime. He mocks the ability of man to bring about his own ends, and points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> divine force molds men's aims into something other than what they intend. Other characters also speak of constraint, such as Polonius, who orders his daughter to lock herself from Hamlet's pursuit, and describes her as being tethered. This adds to the play's description of Hamlet's inability to act out his revenge.|$|E

25|$|On 13 January 2009, {{the authorship}} of Entropa came into question. Officially, the artwork {{was to have}} been an {{international}} collaboration between David Černý and artists from the other 26 EU countries. However, on that day, Alexandr Vondra announced the work was probably created by a smaller group of people, explaining that Černý did not inform him about this until the evening before. The original news article in Lidové noviny pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the artists' names did not seem to exist in their countries' citizen records and had no Internet footprint. Černý himself admitted on 13 January that the artists' names had been fabricated.|$|E
25|$|Murray {{has offered}} the {{potential}} to extend the game through downloadable content that, because of the procedural generation systems used, would likely be {{in the form of}} added features rather than new content. For example, with release of the day one patch, Hello Games has pointed to base building and the ability to purchase freighters as planned additions to the game. Murray anticipates all updates will be freely available, but did not rule <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> yet-planned features may require them to charge for the content. Former Sony executive Shahid Ahmad, who led Sony's efforts to get No Man's Sky, stated that Hello Games had a planned schedule of updates for the game as early as 2013.|$|E
25|$|Even more {{extraordinary}} {{was the way}} Owen {{ignored the}} genuine scientific content of Mantell's work. For example, despite the paucity of finds Mantell had worked <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> dinosaurs were bipedal, including Iguanodon. This remarkable insight was totally ignored by Owen, whose instructions for the Crystal Palace models by Waterhouse Hawkins portrayed Iguanodon as grossly overweight and quadrupedal, with its misidentified thumb on its nose. Mantell did not live to witness the discovery in 1878 of articulated skeletons in a Belgium coal-mine that showed Iguanodon was mostly bipedal (and in that stance could use its thumb for defence). Owen made no comment or retraction; he never did on any errors he made. Moreover, since the earliest known dinosaurs were bipedal, Mantell's idea was indeed insightful.|$|E

25|$|The troop carrier {{pilots in}} their remembrances and {{histories}} admitted to many errors in {{execution of the}} drops but denied the aspersions on their character, citing the many factors since enumerated and faulty planning assumptions. Some, such as Martin Wolfe, an enlisted radio operator with the 436th TCG, pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> late drops were caused by the paratroopers, who were struggling to get their equipment out the door until their aircraft had flown by the drop zone by several miles. Others mistook drops made ahead of theirs for their own drop zones and insisted on going early. The TCC personnel {{also pointed out that}} anxiety at being new to combat was not confined to USAAF crews. Warren reported that official histories showed 9 paratroopers had refused to jump and at least 35 other uninjured paratroopers were returned to England aboard C-47s. General Gavin reported that many paratroopers were in a daze after the drop, huddling in ditches and hedgerows until prodded into action by veterans. Wolfe noted that although his group had botched the delivery of some units in the night drop, it flew a second, daylight mission on D-Day and performed flawlessly although under heavy ground fire from alerted Germans.|$|E
25|$|Ron Eyerman and Andrew Jamison, in Music and Social Movements: Mobilizing Tradition in the Twentieth Century (1998), {{take issue}} with what they {{consider}} Denisoff's reductive approach to the history and function of song (and particularly traditional song) in social movements. They point out that Denisoff had {{paid little attention to}} the song tunes of protest music, considered them strictly subordinate to the texts, a means to the message. It is true that in the highly text-oriented western European song tradition, tunes can be subordinate, interchangeable, and even limited in number (as in Portuguese fado, which only has 64 tunes), nevertheless, Eyerman and Jamison point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the most effective protest songs gain power through their appropriation of tunes that are bearers of strong cultural traditions. They also note that:There is more to music and movements than can be captured within a functional perspective, such as Denisoff's, which focuses on the use made of music within already-existing movements. Music, and song, we suggest, can maintain a movement even when it no longer has a visible presence in the form of organizations, leaders, and demonstrations, and can be a vital force in preparing {{the emergence of a new}} movement. Here the role and place of music needs to be interpreted through a broader framework in which tradition and ritual are understood as processes of identity and identification, as encoded and embodied forms of collective meaning and memory.|$|E
25|$|Tensions {{between the}} two governments peaked again during the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. The United States had a much larger arsenal of {{long-range}} nuclear weapons than the Soviet Union, as well as medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) in Turkey, whereas the Soviet Union had a large stockpile of medium-range nuclear weapons which were primarily located in Europe. Cuba agreed to let the Soviets secretly place SS-4 Sandal and SS-5 Skean MRBMs on their territory. Reports from inside Cuba to exile sources questioned the need for large amounts of ice going to rural areas, {{which led to the}} discovery of the missiles, confirmed by Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance photos. The United States responded by establishing a cordon in international waters to stop Soviet ships from bringing in more missiles (designated a quarantine rather than a blockade to avoid issues with international law). At the same time, Castro was getting a little too extreme for the liking of Moscow, so at the last moment the Soviets called back their ships. In addition, they agreed to remove the missiles already there in exchange for an agreement that the United States would not invade Cuba. Only {{after the fall of the}} Soviet Union was it revealed that another part of the agreement was the removal of U.S. missiles from Turkey. It also turned <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> submarines that the U.S. Navy blocked were carrying nuclear missiles and that communication with Moscow was tenuous, effectively leaving the decision of firing the missiles at the discretion of the captains of those submarines. In addition, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian government revealed that nuclear-armed FROGs (Free Rocket Over Ground) and Ilyushin Il-28 Beagle bombers had also been deployed in Cuba.|$|E

500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule, in his {{volume on}} American coinage, pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> people liked the Lewis and Clark Exposition dollar as it depicted historic figures who affected {{the course of}} American history, rather than a bust intended to be Liberty, and that Barber's coin presaged the 1909 Lincoln cent and the 1932 Washington quarter. Nevertheless, Vermeule deprecated the piece, {{as well as the}} earlier American gold commemorative, the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar. [...] "The lack of spark in these coins, as in so many designs by Barber or Assistant Engraver (later Chief Engraver) Morgan, {{stems from the fact that}} the faces, hair and drapery are flat and the lettering is small, crowded, and even." [...] According to Vermeule, when the two engravers collaborated on a design, such as the 1916 McKinley Birthplace Memorial dollar, [...] "the results were almost oppressive".|$|E
