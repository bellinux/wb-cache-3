40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of an evolutionary process model for style representation emergence in design. It explores issues involved in the interpretation <b>of</b> <b>style,</b> the concept and process <b>of</b> <b>style</b> representation emergence, an evolutionary approach based on genetic engineering, and its computational implementation. Style is a complex phenomenon in design. Interpreting and formulating design style is a difficult task. This thesis proposes a language model which interprets style space utilising hierarchical levels that map onto syntax and semantics. The style space is then formulated using a genetic description. Current studies have discussed shape semantics emergence in design, but none has been proposed for the emergence <b>of</b> <b>style</b> representation. This thesis provides the concept <b>of</b> <b>style</b> representation emergence with the emphasis on the interpretative aspect <b>of</b> <b>style</b> as well as the emergence process. It explores the emergence process <b>of</b> <b>style</b> representation through an evolutionary approach.   Simulation of biological evolution appears to be very useful for design problems. This thesis develops style representation emergence through evolutionary simulation based on genetic engineering. A hierarchical evolutionary process encompassing competition as well as discovery and an evolutionary combination is proposed and developed. A computational representation <b>of</b> <b>style</b> can then be derived by the computer system through the use of this evolutionary process.   This model <b>of</b> <b>style</b> representation emergence is applied to traditional Chinese architecture. An evolutionary system is implemented and presented with some examples of traditional Chinese architectural facades. The results from the implementation of the system are analysed and the utility of this model is investigated. The implementation is developed in a Unix environment using the C language. The AutoCAD package is used for the graphic representation. ...|$|R

It considers the extent to which academic understanding of the materiality of music has moved from the analysis of sound to the analysis of media. It offers a critique of notions of sonic inclusivity and the differentiation of electroacoustic music from instrumental music. It emphasises the importance of comparative analysis and understanding the elements <b>of</b> <b>style</b> in electroacoustic music. It critically examines a number of techniques and frameworks for stylistic analysis. It concludes by encouraging the electroacoustic music community to engage more fully with notions <b>of</b> <b>style...</b>|$|R
