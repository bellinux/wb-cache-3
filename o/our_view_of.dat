5|$|Because the Moon is {{continuously}} blocking <b>our</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> a half-degree-wide circular {{area of the}} sky, {{the related}} phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view. In this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the precession of the lunar orbit, each year different stars are occulted.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} {{gravitational}} lensing {{is found in}} the radio galaxy 3C 324. First thought to be a single overluminous radio galaxy with a redshift of z=1.206, it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies, with the radio galaxy at the aforementioned redshift being lensed by another galaxy at redshift z=0.845. The first example of a multiply-imaged radio galaxy discovered, the source appears to be an elliptical galaxy with a dust lane obscuring <b>our</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus. In even shorter wavelengths, the BL Lac object PG 1553+113 is a heavy emitter of gamma rays. This object is the most distant found to emit photons with energies in the TeV range as of 2007. The spectrum is unique, with hard emission in some ranges of the gamma-ray spectrum in stark contrast to soft emission in others.|$|E

25|$|Our {{ideas about}} God are {{important}} indicators {{of how we}} view the world. According to Adler, these ideas have changed over time, as our {{vision of the world}} – and our place in it – has changed. Consider this example that Adler offers: the traditional belief that people were placed deliberately on earth as God's ultimate creation is being replaced with the idea that people have evolved by natural selection. This coincides with a view of God not as a real being, but as an abstract representation of nature's forces. In this way <b>our</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> God has changed from one that was concrete and specific to one that is more general. From Adler's vantage point, this is a relatively ineffective perception of God because it is so general that it fails to convey a strong sense of direction and purpose.|$|E

Most of the founders and first generation members of the denomination held to this view, and it was presented as official teaching throughout World War I and World War II.

2500|$|The {{essential}} partiality of <b>our</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> things, {{their being}} given {{only in a}} certain perspective and at a certain moment in time does not diminish their reality, but on the contrary establishes it, {{as there is no}} other way for things to be copresent with us and with other things than through such [...] "Abschattungen" [...] (sketches, faint outlines, adumbrations). The thing transcends our view, but is manifest precisely by presenting itself to a range of possible views. The object of perception is immanently tied to its background—to the nexus of meaningful relations among objects within the world. Because the object is inextricably within the world of meaningful relations, each object reflects the other (much in the style of Leibniz's monads). Through involvement in the world – being-in-the-world – the perceiver tacitly experiences [...] all [...] the perspectives upon that object coming from all the surrounding things of its environment, as well as the potential perspectives that that object has upon the beings around it.|$|E
2500|$|Because God is [...] "an {{absolutely}} perfect being" [...] (I), Leibniz {{argues that}} God would be acting imperfectly if he acted with any less perfection {{than what he}} is able of (III). His syllogism then ends {{with the statement that}} God has made the world perfectly in all ways. This also effects how we should view God and his will. Leibniz states that, in lieu of God’s will, {{we have to understand that}} God [...] "is the best of all masters" [...] and he will know when his good succeeds, so we, therefore, must act in conformity to his good will – or as much of it as we understand (IV). In <b>our</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> God, Leibniz declares that we cannot admire the work solely because of the maker, lest we mar the glory and love God in doing so. Instead, we must admire the maker for the work he has done (II). Effectively, Leibniz states that if we say the earth is good because of the will of God, and not good according to some standards of goodness, then how can we praise God for what he has done if contrary actions are also praiseworthy by this definition (II). Leibniz then asserts that different principles and geometry cannot simply be from the will of God, but must follow from his understanding.|$|E
2500|$|The American scholar Susan Morgan called Mansfield Park {{the most}} {{difficult}} of all Austen’s novels as it features the weakest of all of Austen’s heroines who ends up the most beloved member of the Bertram family. Morgan argued that to understand the novel properly requires understanding of the capacity for characters to change or not to change. Mary Crawford, while possessing some good qualities and having much charm and vivacity is ultimately doomed by her superficiality, materialism and an inability to change. A telling example of Mary’s character occurs when says [...] "Look, where I will, I see that it is so; and I feel that it must be", as she assumes that what she sees before her is all that will ever be, and the possibility of anything else existing does not occur to her. Through not devoid of kindness, Mary has a strong competitive streak that leads her to see love as a game where one party conquers and controls the other, which coupled with her cynicism and narcissism makes her insensitive towards the feelings of others, as she insists that Edmund abandons his clerical career merely it is not prestigious enough for her and her inability to appreciate improvements, as she likes things whole and lacks the discernment to value change in one's moral character and the hard work necessary to bring it about. Price by contrast is unique amongst the Austen heroines in that her story begins when she is 10 and traces her story up to the age 17. When Price is sent to Mansfield Park, her tears at leaving the only home she has ever known, shows her awareness of the past, of who she is and was, and her wish to maintain her identity. Morgan wrote though Price is a flawed heroine, she possesses [...] "…the energy, open to us all, to struggle against selfishness, toward self-knowledge, and that generosity of mind which should illuminate <b>our</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the people around us.". Austen also suggests change can be either for the worse or the better as Price almost succumbs to Henry Crawford’s charm and apparent reformation of character, even though she knows deep down that he is by nature malleable and undependable because he does not feel very much, and therefore whatever his passions are now will be easily replaced. Morgan argued that Price’s principle virtue is that of" [...] growing worth", her ability to understand the world around her, to use her reason, to care about others, to change yet remain true to herself.|$|E
