5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of {{linezolid}} is {{its high}} bioavailability (close to 100%) when given by mouth: the entire dose reaches the bloodstream, {{as if it}} had been given intravenously. This means that people receiving intravenous linezolid may be switched to oral linezolid as soon as their condition allows it, whereas comparable antibiotics (such as vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) can only be given intravenously.|$|E
5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{a catastrophic}} hazard in diving, because a seizure results in near certain death by drowning. The seizure may occur suddenly {{and with no}} warning symptoms. The effects are sudden convulsions and unconsciousness, during which victims can lose their regulator and drown. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of a full-face diving mask is prevention of regulator loss {{in the event of}} a seizure. As there is an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity on deep dives, long dives and dives where oxygen-rich breathing gases are used, divers are taught to calculate a maximum operating depth for oxygen-rich breathing gases, and cylinders containing such mixtures must be clearly marked with that depth.|$|E

5|$|The {{nematode}} worm Caenorhabditis elegans, like Drosophila, {{has been}} studied largely because of its importance in genetics. In the early 1970s, Sydney Brenner chose it as a model organism for studying the way that genes control development. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of working with this worm is that the body plan is very stereotyped: the nervous system of the hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons, always in the same places, making identical synaptic connections in every worm. Brenner's team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed each one under an electron microscope, then visually matched fibers from section to section, to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body. The complete neuronal wiring diagram of C.elegans – its connectome was achieved. Nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism, and the information gained has enabled a multitude of studies that would otherwise have not been possible.|$|E

CTL responses can be raised against immunodominant and immunorecessive CTL epitopes, as well as subdominant CTL epitopes, in a manner that appears to mimic natural infection. This may prove to be a useful tool in assessing CTL epitopes and their role in providing immunity.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of the plug-in hybrid {{design is}} that the {{generator}} can be completely decoupled from the traction. Unlike a conventional engine, which operates over {{a wide variety of}} power settings and operational conditions, the range extender can be operated under optimum conditions at all times. High-efficiency power sources that are not suitable for normal automotive use may be perfectly suitable for PEV use. These include advanced close-cycle steam engines, stirling engines, Wankel engines, and microturbines due primarily to their light weight and small size.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of {{testicular}} cancer occurring in undescended testes is seminoma. It is usually treatable if caught early, so urologists often recommend that boys who had orchiopexy as infants be taught testicular self-examination, to recognize testicular masses and seek early medical care for them. Cancer developing in an intra-abdominal testis would be unlikely to be recognized before considerable growth and spread, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of orchiopexy is that a mass developing in a scrotal testis is far easier to recognize than an intra-abdominal mass.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the most}} popular style is the sled-foot trestle base. With this design, each pair of legs is put {{together}} {{in the form of}} an 'I' with two vertical bars. The leg pairs are connected by a pair of stretchers. These stretchers can be permanently fixed to the leg-pairs, or they can be made removable with tusk tenons or a bed-bolt arrangement. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of this style is that there is no end-grain resting on the floor, so the legs are not as prone to wick-up moisture and rot.|$|E

25|$|If a {{publisher}} wishes to restrict {{use of its}} HD DVD content, it may use the Advanced Access Content System (AACS) although this is not required for normal disc playback. AACS is a standard for content distribution and digital rights management. It is developed by AACS Licensing Administrator, LLC (AACS LA), a consortium that includes Disney, Intel, Microsoft, Panasonic, Warner Bros., IBM, Toshiba and Sony. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> over CSS, the content restriction system for DVDs, is that AACS allows content providers to revoke an individual player device if its cryptographic keys have been compromised (meaning {{that it will not}} be able to decrypt subsequently released content). There is no Region Coding in the existing HD DVD specification, which means that titles from any country can be played in players in any other country.|$|E
25|$|The Gothic {{style of}} figure {{painting}} began {{to give way}} to a more naturalistic style in which the figures seem more three-dimensional and portrait-like. An important source at this time was German wood engravings and etchings. These were available in a number of forms. Bibles and Bible picture books were available with several different series of such engravings. The works of Albrecht Dürer were much admired. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of using engravings as a source was that the essentially linear techniques that were employed by the engraver to define forms could be easily interpreted in lead and the fine linear treatment of shadows was likewise easy for the stained glass artist to achieve using the monochrome paint technique. There were also windows imported into England at this time from the studios of Mayer of Munich which influenced English designers towards this style.|$|E
25|$|Many systems {{also support}} a {{low-power}} sleep mode {{in which the}} processing functions of the machine are powered down, using a little power to preserve the contents of RAM and support waking up. Instantaneous resumption is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of sleep mode over hibernation. A hibernated system must start up and read data back to RAM, which typically takes time. A system in sleep mode only needs to power up the CPU and display, which is almost instantaneous. On the other hand, a system in sleep mode still consumes power to keep the data in the RAM. Detaching power from a system in sleep mode results in data loss, while cutting {{the power of a}} system in hibernation has no risk; the hibernated system can resume when and if the power is restored. Both shut down and hibernated systems may consume standby power unless they are unplugged.|$|E
