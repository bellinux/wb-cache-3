40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{elucidate}} {{the effect of}} treatment timing on procedural clinical outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) for patients treated by endosaccular coil embolization. METHODS: A group of 327 patients who were consecutively treated, during a 46 -month period, for ruptured intracranial aneurysms by coil embolization within 30 days after SAH were evaluated. Outcomes were assessed by comparing immediate pretreatment World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grades, 72 -hour posttreatment WFNS grades, and modified Glasgow Outcome Scale scores at 6 months for patients treated within 48 hours (Group 1), 3 to 10 days (Group 2), or 11 to 30 days (Group 3) after SAH. RESULTS: The three interval-to-treatment groups included 33, 38, and 29 % of the patients, respectively. Before treatment, 70 % of the patients in Group 1, 78 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in <b>Group</b> 2, and 83 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in <b>Group</b> 3 were in good clinical grades (i. e., WFNS Grade 1 or 2). After coil embolization, the WFNS grades were either unchanged or improved for 93. 5 % of the patients in Group 1, 89. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in <b>Group</b> 2, and 91. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in <b>Group</b> 3. After 6 months, 81. 3 % of the patients in Group 1 experienced good outcomes (modified Glasgow Outcome Scale scores of 1 or 2), as did 84 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in <b>Group</b> 2 and 80 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in <b>Group</b> 3. No statistical difference was demonstrated between the three groups when they were compared for these two variables. CONCLUSION: The interval between endovascular treatment and SAH did not affect periprocedural morbidity rates or 6 -month outcomes. Coil embolization should therefore be performed {{as early as possible}} after aneurysmal SAH, to prevent aneurysmal rerupture...|$|R

25|$|The areas {{abandoned}} by the Central Powers became a field of conflict among local governments created by Germany, other local governments that independently sprang up after the German withdrawal, and the Bolsheviks, who hoped to incorporate those areas into Bolshevik Russia. Internal power struggles prevented any of the governments in Belarus from gaining real power. The situation in Ukraine was even more complex, with sizable Ukrainian forces divided and ongoing conflicts among Nestor Makhno's anarchists, the communists, the White Russians, various governments of Ukraine, and the renascent Polish Army. The situation was further complicated when self-defence forces began to form in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia as well. Many <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>groups</b> were fragmented, merged, divided, formed short alliances with others, and almost constantly fought. Almost the entire Eastern Europe was in chaos.|$|E

Only nematodes, crustaceans, and mites are likely to have global populations of similar magnitude, and each <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>groups</b> except mites is more inclusive: though taxonomic rank cannot be used for absolute comparisons, it is notable that nematodes are a phylum and crustaceans a subphylum.

25|$|The 1950 Constitution of India, {{introduced}} {{after the}} country gained independence, included measures {{to improve the}} socioeconomic conditions of Dalits.

Communities that were categorised as being one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>groups</b> were guaranteed {{a percentage of the}} seats in the national and state legislatures, as well as in government jobs and places of education. The system has its origins in the 1932 Poona Pact between Ambedkar and Gandhi, when Ambedkar conceded his demand that the Dalits should have an electorate separate from the caste Hindus in return for Gandhi accepting measures along these lines. The notion of a separate electorate had been proposed in the Communal Award made by the British Raj authorities, and the outcome of the Pact - the Government of India Act of 1935 - both introduced the new term of Scheduled Castes in replacement for Depressed Classes and reserved seats for them in the legislatures.|$|E

25|$|Many natural {{products}} have very complex structures. The perceived complexity {{of a natural}} product is a qualitative matter, consisting of consideration of its molecular mass, the particular arrangements of substructures (functional groups, rings etc.) with respect to one another, the number and density of those functional groups, the stability <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>groups</b> and of the molecule as a whole, the number and type of stereochemical elements, the physical properties of the molecule and its intermediates (which bear on the ease of its handling and purification), all of these viewed {{in the context of}} the novelty of the structure and whether preceding related synthetic efforts have been successful (see below for details). Some {{natural products}}, especially those less complex, are easily and cost-effectively prepared via complete chemical synthesis from readily available, simpler chemical ingredients, a process referred to as total synthesis (especially when the process involves no steps mediated by biological agents). Not all natural products are amenable to total synthesis, cost-effective or otherwise. In particular, those most complex often are not. Many are accessible, but the required routes are simply too expensive to allow synthesis on any practical or industrial scale. However, in order to be available for further study, all natural products must yield to isolation and purification. This may suffice if isolation provides appropriate quantities of the natural product for the intended purpose (e.g. as a drug to alleviate disease). Drugs such as penicillin, morphine, and paclitaxel proved to be affordably acquired at needed commercial scales solely via isolation procedures (without any significant synthetic chemistry contributing). However, in other cases, needed agents are not available without synthetic chemistry manipulations.|$|E

500|$|Convergent {{evolution}} is the independent evolution of similar features in species of different lineages.

The recurrent evolution of flight is a classic example, as flying insects, birds, pterosaurs, and bats have independently evolved the useful capacity of flight. Functionally similar features that have arisen through convergent evolution are analogous, whereas homologous structures or traits have a common origin but can have dissimilar functions. [...] Bird, bat, and pterosaur wings are analogous structures, but their forelimbs are homologous, sharing an ancestral state despite serving different functions.|$|E

Disputes have emerged over language policy, since a sizeable part of the population, and in many areas the majority of the population, speak Spanish as a native language. The biggest debates are over bilingual education for language minority students, the availability of non-English ballots and election materials and whether or not English is the official language. It has evolved into an ethnic conflict between the pluralists who support bilingualism and linguistic access and the assimilationists who strongly oppose this and lead the official English movement. The United States does not have an official language, but English is the default national language, spoken by the overwhelming majority of the country's population.|$|E
