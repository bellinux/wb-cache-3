5|$|Early writers {{combined}} ctenophores with cnidarians into {{a single}} phylum called Coelenterata on account of morphological similarities between the two groups. Like cnidarians, the bodies of ctenophores consist of a mass of jelly, with one layer of cells {{on the outside and}} another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, however, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only a single cell deep. Ctenophores also resemble cnidarians in relying on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration, as well as in having a decentralized nerve net rather than a brain. However, genomic studies have suggested that the neurons of Ctenophora, which differ in many ways from other animal neurons, evolved independently from those of the other animals, and increasing awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> groups has persuaded more recent authors to classify the two as separate phyla. The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores.|$|E

25|$|In statistics, {{ordinary}} {{least squares}} (OLS) or linear least squares is a method for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model, {{with the goal of}} minimizing the sum of the squares <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> observed responses (values of the variable being predicted) in the given dataset and those predicted by a linear function of a set of explanatory variables. Visually this is seen as the sum of the squared vertical distances between each data point in the set and the corresponding point on the regression line – the smaller the differences, the better the model fits the data. The resulting estimator can be expressed by a simple formula, {{especially in the case of}} a single regressor on the right-hand side.|$|E

25|$|Success {{was laid}} down by Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney, New South Wales on 9 August 1980. She was {{launched}} on 3 March 1984, and commissioned into the RAN on 23 April 1986. Success is the largest ship to ever be built in Australia for the RAN, and is the largest ship {{to be built in}} Port Jackson (the port of Sydney). She was also the last major vessel to be constructed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. In June 1983 the contract were renegotiated while construction was underway, with the acceptance date being extended by three years and the project cost increased to $187.3 million. The cost and time overruns were primarily due to protracted dispute between the Commonwealth and the builder over the drawings and specifications received from France, with evidence that the Department of Defence underestimated the extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> original Australian building specifications and those supplied. Additional factors in the time and cost increases were a lack of tradesmen skilled in naval construction, overly bureaucratic management, and low labour productivity. The final project cost was estimated at $197.41 million; the dramatic increase in cost prevented the construction of a planned second ship.|$|E

Suzuki has estimated that he composed over 100 pieces of music for EarthBound, including songs that did not make it into the game, and says that his favorite was the music played when the player rode a bicycle in the game, which he had actually composed before starting work on the game.|$|E
