5|$|The {{first set}} of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924. Two of the routes assigned at this time were NY6, a north–south route extending from the New York City line to the Canadian border, and NY30, another north–south route connecting NY6 in Mechanicville to the Vermont state line west of Fair Haven. NY6 left Albany <b>on</b> <b>modern</b> NY32 and followed it to Mechanicville, where NY6 veered westward on what is now NY67 and NY30 picked up the current alignment of NY32. NY30 continued north <b>on</b> <b>modern</b> NY32 to Glens Falls, at which point it went east to Hudson Falls via Warren and River streets. It headed northward from there to Vermont <b>on</b> <b>modern</b> US4. From Mechanicville to Schuylerville, NY30 utilized the alignment of legislative Route44. By 1926, NY30 was rerouted north of Whitehall to continue north toward the Canadian border. The old alignment of NY30 between Whitehall and Vermont was not assigned a new number. Meanwhile, an alternate route of NY6 {{on the east side}} of the Hudson River between NY5 (now US20) in East Greenbush and NY6 in Waterford was designated as NY6B by 1926.|$|E

5|$|All {{of what is}} now NY31F was {{originally}} designated as part of Route20, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. Route20 entered the village of Macedon <b>on</b> <b>modern</b> NY31 and continued westward to Rochester on current NY96. On March1, 1921, Route20 was realigned to utilize modern NY31 and NY250 between Macedon and Fairport. Although all of modern NY31F was part of a legislative route at one time and was state-maintained west of Fairport and from Macedon Center to Macedon by 1926, it was not assigned a posted route number until the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|As a harpsichordist, Pinnock toured Europe {{with the}} Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. While {{a student at}} the RCM, he was told by the registrar, John Stainer, that it would be {{impossible}} to make a living as a harpsichordist. He made his London debut at the Royal Festival Hall in 1966 with the Galliard Harpsichord Trio, which he co-founded with Stephen Preston, flute, and Anthony Pleeth, cello. At this stage, they were playing baroque music <b>on</b> <b>modern</b> instruments. His solo harpsichord debut was in 1968 at the Purcell Room in London.|$|E
5|$|By 1926, {{the piece}} of current NY9N from Hague to Ticonderoga was {{designated}} as the easternmost leg of NY47, which continued west to Chestertown <b>on</b> <b>modern</b> NY8. In 1927, most of NY6 north of Round Lake was replaced by US9 when U.S. Highways were first signed in New York. The lone exception was between Elizabethtown and Keeseville, where US9 followed a previously unnumbered highway to the east instead. The bypassed section of NY6 between the two locations was redesignated as NY9W at this time. NY9W was renumbered to NY9N {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, eliminating the alphanumerical duplication between itself and US9W.|$|E
5|$|By 1933, NY17A was {{extended}} eastward along NY210 to Southfields, completing the alternate loop of NY17, while NY210 was realigned on its east end by 1938 to end at US9W in Stony Point. Instead of following Willow Point Road, the highway remained <b>on</b> <b>modern</b> Gate Hill Road to {{the vicinity of}} Stony Point, where it entered the hamlet on Main Street. It was rerouted again between 1968 and 1973 to bypass Main Street to the south on Central Drive.|$|E

5|$|Dominica's folk musical {{heritage}} includes work songs, storytelling, children's {{music and}} masquerade songs. Dominican work songs {{are accompanied by}} the tambou twavay drum, and are performed by workers while gathering fruit, building roads, fishing, moving a house or sawing wood. Many are responsorial, and are generally short and simple, with the lyrical text and rhythm tying into the work to be accompanied. <b>On</b> <b>modern</b> Dominica, work songs are rarely performed.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the song}} being {{influenced}} from funk and rock, the indie rock music origins allowed it to hit the alternative charts peaking at a moderately successful number 16 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and due {{to the song}}'s number 1 success on the pop charts, it led to be played often <b>on</b> <b>modern</b> rock radio stations despite only hitting number 16.|$|E
5|$|Fermi, {{learning}} of Ulam's breakthrough, devised an analog computer {{known as the}} Monte Carlo trolley, later dubbed the FERMIAC.

In particular, many Monte Carlo calculations carried out <b>on</b> <b>modern</b> massively parallel supercomputers are embarrassingly parallel applications, whose results can be very accurate.|$|E

5|$|Historically, optical astronomy, {{also called}} visible light astronomy, {{is the oldest}} form of astronomy. Images of {{observations}} were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century {{and most of the}} 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded <b>on</b> <b>modern</b> medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 Å to 7000 Å (400 nm to 700nm), that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route20, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} Elbridge to Rochester via Fairport. Initially, Route20 entered the village on High Street and followed Main Street south across the Erie Canal to Church Street, where it turned west toward Rochester. On March1, 1921, Route20 was realigned to enter Monroe County <b>on</b> <b>modern</b> NY31. At {{the junction of}} Palmyra and Moseley Roads, Route20 turned north, following SH1290 into Fairport. It rejoined its original alignment at the junction of Church and Main Streets. None of SH1290 received a signed designation when {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route32, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} North Lawrence to Ogdensburg via Winthrop and Massena. It entered Massena {{on what is}} now NY420 and followed Main Street and Maple Street through the village. West of Massena, the highway was routed on Town Line Road and River Road to a junction east of Waddington, where Route32 continued west <b>on</b> <b>modern</b> NY37 to Waddington. When state highways in New York were first posted in 1924, the portion of Route32 between Waddington and Massena became part of NY3, a highway extending across {{the width of the}} state.|$|E
