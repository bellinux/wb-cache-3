5|$|Michael began {{negotiating}} with the Emperor over his <b>official</b> <b>position</b> in Transylvania. The latter wanted the principality under direct Imperial rule with Michael acting as governor. The Wallachian voivode, on the other hand, wanted the title of Prince of Transylvania for himself and equally claimed the Partium region. Michael was, nevertheless, willing to acknowledge Habsburg overlordship.|$|E

50|$|Yet amidst {{all these}} reforms, Anastasius I {{continued}} {{the practice of}} selling <b>official</b> <b>positions.</b> In fact, he sold enough <b>official</b> <b>positions</b> {{that he has been}} accused of having facilitated the creation of a civilian aristocracy; a claim that is strengthened by the growth in influence of families that often held high level positions in the government such as the Appiones from Egypt. Anastasius I also gave <b>official</b> <b>positions</b> to his close friend general Celer, his brother-in-law, his brother, his nephews, and his grand-nephews. This can be considered noteworthy given that the emperor seems to have minimized government corruption/inefficiency in other areas.|$|R

5|$|Governor Johnson, {{despite his}} {{presumptive}} <b>official</b> <b>position,</b> his age (50), and a crippled arm, volunteered to serve under General John C. Breckinridge and Colonel Robert P. Trabue at the Battle of Shiloh. On April 7, Johnson was severely {{wounded in the}} thigh and abdomen, and lay on the battlefield until the following day. Johnson was recognized and helped by acquaintance and fellow Freemason, Alexander McDowell McCook, a Union general. However, Johnson died aboard the Union hospital ship Hannibal, and the provisional government of Kentucky was left leaderless.|$|E

The three Fuegians taken on the previous voyage were going to be returned to Tierra del Fuego on the Beagle together with the missionary Richard Matthews.|$|E

5|$|King William {{appointed}} his friend, the Duchess of Northumberland, as Victoria's official governess in 1831, but {{the role}} was mostly ceremonial, and the princess continued {{to depend on}} Lehzen. The Duchess was dismissed in 1837 by Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, for attempting to become more influential in Victoria's education. During this time, Lehzen held no <b>official</b> <b>position</b> at court; despite her recently acquired title, her commoner status {{continued to be a}} hindrance.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March 1962, the {{recently}} re-convened Léopoldville Parliament, under Cyrille Adoula, agreed {{to modify the}} Constitution and gave South Kasai official provincial status. In April 1962, UN troops were ordered to occupy South Kasai as part of U Thant's new aggressive stance against secession following Hammarskjöld's death. In Léopoldville, Kalonji was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. On 7 September, however, Kalonji escaped from prison and returned to South Kasai where he hoped to regain an <b>official</b> <b>position</b> in local elections and, {{at the head of}} a government, regain his immunity.|$|E

The Supreme Court responded by making a major shift in policy, and no longer applied strict constitutional limits to government programs, and also began to take a more active role in protecting civil liberties.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{stance of}} the BJP towards foreign policy, like the Jana Sangh, {{was based on}} an aggressive Hindu nationalism combined with economic protectionism. The Jana Sangh was founded with the explicit aim of reversing the partition of India; as a result, its <b>official</b> <b>position</b> was that the existence of Pakistan was illegitimate. This antagonism toward Pakistan remains a significant influence on the BJP's ideology. The party and its affiliates have strongly opposed India's long standing policy of nonalignment, and instead advocate closeness to the United States.|$|E

5|$|Body {{piercing}} in some religions is {{held to be}} {{destructive to}} the body. Some passages of the Bible, including Leviticus 19:28, have been interpreted as prohibiting body modification because the body is held to be the property of God. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has taken an <b>official</b> <b>position</b> against most piercings unless for medical reasons, although they accept piercings for women {{as long as there}} is only one set of piercings in the lower lobe of the ears and no other place on the body. Wearing of very large nose rings on Shabbat is forbidden by the Talmud.|$|E
5|$|In the United States {{a similar}} line was taken, {{notwithstanding}} two official intelligence reports into the Katyn massacre that contradicted the <b>official</b> <b>position.</b> In 1944, Roosevelt assigned his special emissary to the Balkans, Navy Lieutenant Commander George Earle, {{to produce a}} report on Katyn. Earle concluded that the massacre was committed by the Soviet Union. Having consulted with Elmer Davis, director of the United States Office of War Information, Roosevelt rejected the conclusion (officially), declared that he was convinced of Nazi Germany's responsibility, and ordered that Earle's report be suppressed. When Earle formally requested permission to publish his findings, the President issued a written order to desist. Earle was reassigned and {{spent the rest of}} the war in American Samoa.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November, {{the detainees}} were deported, {{along with their}} families. Although this was an entirely German initiative—Quisling himself was left unaware {{although}} government assistance was provided—Quisling led the Norwegian public {{to believe that the}} first deportation of Jews, to camps in Poland, was his idea. A further 250 were deported in February 1943, and it remains unclear what the party's <b>official</b> <b>position</b> was on the eventual fate of the 759 Norwegian deportees. There is evidence to suggest that Quisling honestly believed the official line throughout 1943 and 1944, that they were awaiting repatriation to a new Jewish homeland.|$|E

5|$|The Empire of Japan endeavored, through {{education}} initiatives and specific {{financial support for}} new shrines, to frame Shinto practice as a patriotic moral tradition. From the early Meiji era, the divine origin of the Emperor was the <b>official</b> <b>position</b> of the state, and taught in classrooms not as myth, but as historical fact. Shinto priests were hired to teach in public schools, and cultivated this teaching, alongside reverence for the Emperor and compulsory class trips to shrines. State Shinto practitioners also emphasized the ritual aspect as a traditional civic practice that did not explicitly call on faith to participate.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{reasons for}} the Second Settlement were as follows. First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, {{he was no longer}} in an <b>official</b> <b>position</b> to rule the state, yet his {{dominant}} position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a proconsul. When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary. When he relinquished his annual consulship, he legally lost this power because his proconsular powers applied only to his imperial provinces. Augustus wanted to keep this power.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} year in office, Clarke {{established}} good order in the colony. Unlike Osborn, who treated Colenso's presence at the trials in 1888 as an affront, Clarke took up Colenso's cause and recommended to the Colonial Office in London that Dinuzulu and his uncles be allowed to return from exile, having been sufficiently punished for his supposed offences. Clarke, persuaded by Colenso, argued that Dinuzulu would not cause further trouble so long as the policy of fomenting intertribal strife were discontinued and Dinuzulu be appointed induna. He began the process for the return of Dinuzulu and sought to harness the authority of the Zulu leader to the administration. In January 1895, the exiles received notice of their return to Zululand with an <b>official</b> <b>position</b> for Dinuzulu. Their departure was set for February 1895 but was delayed after Ministers in London recommended that Zululand first be annexed to Natal.|$|E
