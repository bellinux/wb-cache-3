Secondly, the thesis describes <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> on <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> <b>The</b> thesis is dived into {{the three main}} parts and the conclusion. <b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and its causes are described in the first part. <b>The</b> deconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is a process changing quality of legal order. As a consequence of that interpretational difficulties come in specific situations (or more precisely - it {{is not sufficient to}} infer a legal rule from regulatory legislation just by standard interpretative methods). This process has its several causes. Decomposition of religion and ethics (as the two significant social regulatory systems) and perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> as a technical instrument guiding the society, they both caused <b>the</b> extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is now understood as the technical instrument guiding the society, then an acceleration of social development results in <b>the</b> acceleration <b>of</b> changes in legal rules.

5|$|Wulfhelm was {{translated}} from the Bishopric of Wells to be Archbishop of Canterbury in about 926. While he was archbishop, he was a frequent attendee of the royal court, and King Æthelstan of England says in his law code that Wulfhelm was consulted on the drafting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws.</b> Wulfhelm also advised the king on the Ordinance on Charities issued by Æthelstan. One of the surviving manuscripts of Æthelstan's laws has an epilogue that stated that the law was declared and decided at a synod held at Grately where Wulfhelm was present. From other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> issued by the king, it appears that Wulfhelm also presided at a council held at Thunderfield, at which the reeves of London pledged to keep the king's peace. The implication of the various accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of Æthelstan is that Wulfhelm was highly involved in royal {{efforts to improve the}} law code.|$|E
5|$|According to Christian theologian Gordon J.

Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status as Jews.|$|E
