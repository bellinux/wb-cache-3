50|$|Under ideal {{circumstances}} most detection {{techniques can}} be considered theoretically as interferometers and, as such, their ultimate sensitivities are all roughly equal. This is because, in all these techniques, interferometry is used to linearize the detection transfer function and when linearized, maximum sensitivity is achieved. Under these conditions, photon shot noise dominates the sensitivity and this is fundamental to all the optical detection techniques. However,the ultimate limit {{is determined by the}} phonon shot noise. Since the phonon frequency is many orders of magnitude lower than the photon frequency, the ultimate sensitivity of ultrasonic detection can be muchhigher. The usual method for increasing the sensitivity of optical detection is to use more optical power. However, the shot noise limited SNR is proportional to the square root of the total detection power. Thus, increasing optical power has limited effect, and damaging power levels are easily reached before achieving an adequate SNR.Consequently, optical detection frequent has lower SNR than non-optical contacting techniques. <b>Optical</b> <b>generation</b> (at least in the firmly thermodynamic regime) is proportional to the optical power used and itis generally more efficient to improve the generation rather than the detection (again the limit is the damage threshold).|$|E

5000|$|The concept behind Super 35 {{originated}} with the Tushinsky Brothers' SuperScope format, particularly the SuperScope 235 specification from 1956. In 1982, Joe Dunton revived the format for Dance Craze, and Technicolor soon marketed {{it under the}} name [...] "Super Techniscope" [...] before the industry settled on the name Super 35. The central driving idea behind the process is to return to shooting in the original silent [...] "Edison" [...] 1.33:1 full 4-perf negative area (24.89 mm by 18.67 mm or 0.980 in by 0.735 in), and then crop the frame either from the bottom or the center (like 1.85:1) to create a 2.40:1 aspect ratio (matching that of anamorphic lenses) with an area of 24 mm by 10 mm (0.945 in by 0.394 in). Although this cropping may seem extreme, by expanding the negative area out perf-to-perf, Super 35 creates a 2.40:1 aspect ratio with an overall negative area of 240 square millimeters (0.372 sq in), only 9 mm2 (0.014 sq in) less than the 1.85:1 crop of the Academy frame (248.81 mm2 or 0.386 sq in). The cropped frame is then converted at the intermediate stage to a 4-perf anamorphically squeezed print compatible with the anamorphic projection standard. This allows an [...] "anamorphic" [...] frame to be captured with non-anamorphic lenses, which are much more common. Up to 2000, once the film was photographed in Super 35, an optical printer was used to anamorphose (squeeze) the image. This optical step reduced {{the overall quality of}} the image and made Super 35 a controversial subject among cinematographers, many who preferred the higher image quality and frame negative area of anamorphic photography (especially with regard to granularity). With the advent of Digital intermediates (DI) {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century, however, Super 35 photography has become even more popular, since everything could be done digitally, scanning the original 4-perf 1.33:1 (or 3-perf 1.78:1) picture and cropping it to the 2.39:1 frame already in-computer, without anamorphosing stages, and also without creating an additional <b>optical</b> <b>generation</b> with increased grain. This process of creating the aspect ratio in the computer allows the studios to perform all post-production and editing of the movie in its original aspect (1.33:1 or 1.78:1) and to then release the cropped version, while still having the original when necessary (for Pan & Scan, HDTV transmission, etc.).|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. A {{one-dimensional}} {{numerical simulation}} of photovoltaic (PV) cells has been written, {{and has been}} designated RAUPV 2. An algorithm for determining the <b>optical</b> <b>generation</b> rate profile, taking into account multiple internal reflections in a multilayer cell has been developed. A method which enables realistic boundary values to be calculated, using RAUPV 2 itself, has been developed. This method allows all three boundary values (', Fn and Fp) at each surface, to be determined, without the need to specify any additional input parameters. A comprehensive set of input parameters for aSi:H PV cells has been established, {{in consultation with the}} literature. Dangling-bond theory has been described and input parameters for dangling-bond defects have been presented. The effect of surface states in the p-layer on the contact potential at the TCO/p interface has been investigated. It was found that there is an intimate relationship between the contact potential and the parameters pertaining to the surface states. A simple method has been demonstrated, which has allowed RAUPV 2 to reproduce the J-V curve of an existing aSi:H PV cell. The method requires that only the dangling-bond concentration in the i-layer and the contact potential at the Sn 02 /P interface needs to be adjusted. Once the J- V curve had been generated, the simulation results were used to characterise the empirical cell, in both thermodynamic- and steady-state equilibrium. This simulated cell was designated the realistic cell. The effect of asymmetries in the input parameters, under carrier band mobility interchange, on the performance of p-i-n cells has been investigated. The results indicate that, while asymmetries in the gap state distributions do give rise to asymmetrical behaviour in the J- V curve, the effect is slight, and it is the positional asymmetry of the <b>optical</b> <b>generation</b> profile that is mostly responsible for the observed asymmetry in the J- V curve under mobility interchange. An investigation of the limiting carrier effect has led to the conclusion that, in a p-i-n aSi:H cell under forward bias, the electron is the limiting carrier. This has been explained by appealing to the form of the <b>optical</b> <b>generation</b> profile, since most electron-hole pairs (EHPs) are generated near the front of the cell, and it is electrons that must be collected at the back contact. Investigations of the n-i-p aSi:H cell, under forward bias, have shown the hole to be the limiting carrier. It was found that the introduction of positional symmetry into the <b>optical</b> <b>generation</b> rate profile greatly reduced the limiting carrier effect, and it was concluded that the limiting carrier effect arises due to the asymmetries in the material parameters of the cell, particularly the _ positional asymmetry of the <b>optical</b> <b>generation</b> profile. It was observed that the nature of the <b>optical</b> <b>generation</b> profile actually {{plays an important role in}} determining the identity of the limiting carrier, in a p-i-n cell. The same effect was not observed in the n-i-p cell. The effective carrier collection length has been defined, and it was seen that the limiting carrier possesses the larger effective collection length. The effect of boron and phosphorous profiling of the i-layer was studied. It was found that boron profiling led to a decrease in cell performance, while phosphorous profiling improved cell performance. It was found that there was a P concentration at which cell performance peaked. The dependence of the spectral response of the realistic cell on device length L, was investigated, showing a general improvement in the spectral response as L was decreased. The spectral response has been interpreted in a novel way. It was assumed that the form of the monochromatic <b>optical</b> <b>generation</b> profiles in the vicinity of the peak in the spectral response represented optimal generation profiles. These profiles were subjected to a linear transformation, such that their form was preserved but that their integrated value was the same as that of the realistic <b>optical</b> <b>generation</b> profile, under global AM 1. 5 illumination. Using these transformed <b>optical</b> <b>generation</b> profiles, J- V curves were obtained. The maximum power output PM of these J- V curves was seen to exhibit a maximum some 17 % greater than that of the realistic cell with a realistic <b>optical</b> <b>generation</b> profile. The spectral response of the phosphorous profiled cell was obtained. In a manner similar to that for the non-P profiled cell, the optimal generation profile was found. The PM for this profile was found to be 7. 86 mWcm - 2, considerably larger than the 5. 60 mWcm- 2 for the phosphorous profiled cell with a realistic <b>optical</b> <b>generation</b> profile. The effect on the simulation output of variations in numerous dangling-bond defect input parameters has been investigated. It was found that the energy position and concentration of the doped layer defects need not be known to a high degree of precision. On the other hand, it was found that the energy position of the i-layer defects, the standard deviation of the defect distributions, and the defect carrier capture cross-sections, do need to be known with certainty...|$|E
