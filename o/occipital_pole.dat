40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Alström {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} inherited ciliopathy in which early progressive cone-rod dystrophy leads to childhood blindness. We investigated functional and structural changes of the optic pathway in Alström syndrome by using MR imaging to {{provide insight into the}} underlying pathogenic mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients with genetically proved Alström syndrome (mean age, 23 years; range, 6 - 45 years; 5 females) and 19 age- and sex-matched controls underwent brain MR imaging. The study protocol included conventional sequences, resting-state functional MR imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging. RESULTS: In patients with Alström syndrome, the evaluation of the occipital regions showed the following: 1) diffuse white matter volume decrease while gray matter volume decrease spared the <b>occipital</b> <b>poles</b> (voxel-based morphometry), 2) diffuse fractional anisotropy decrease and radial diffusivity increase while mean and axial diffusivities were normal (tract-based spatial statistics), and 3) reduced connectivity in the medial visual network strikingly sparing the <b>occipital</b> <b>poles</b> (independent component analysis). After we placed seeds in both <b>occipital</b> <b>poles,</b> the seed-based analysis revealed significantly increased connectivity in patients with Alström syndrome toward the left frontal operculum, inferior and middle frontal gyri, and the medial portion of both thalami (left seed) and toward the anterior portion of the left insula (right and left seeds).

50|$|Research was {{conducted}} in 2014 on Alström syndrome patients regarding degeneration and plasticity of the optic pathway. The functional and structural changes have been investigated on the optic pathway in Alström syndrome by using magnetic resonance imaging to provide better insight on the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Eleven patients with the syndrome (mean age of 23 years, 5 females, 6 males) underwent a brain MRI. The protocol also included conventional sequences, resting-state functional MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging. Results found that patients with Alström syndrome had occipital regions with decreased white matter volume as well as decreased gray matter volume sparing the <b>occipital</b> <b>poles.</b> The diffused fractional anisotropy decreased and the radial diffusivity increased while mean and axial diffusivities were normal. Lastly, the reduced connectivity in the medial visual network was strikingly sparing the <b>occipital</b> <b>poles.</b> The conclusion of the research was that the protean occipital brain changes in patients with Alström syndrome. They are likely to reflect coexistence of diffuse primary myelin derangement, anterograde trans-synaptic degeneration, and complex cortical reorganization that affect the posterior and anterior visual cortex.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the strongest}} {{predictors}} of {{the speed with which}} adults can name a pictured object is the age at which the object and its name are first learned. Age of acquisition also predicts the retention or loss of individual words following brain damage in conditions like aphasia and Alzheimer's disease. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was used to reveal brain areas differentially involved in naming objects with early or late acquired names. A baseline task involved passive viewing of non-objects. The comparison between the silent object naming conditions (early and late) with baseline showed significant activation in frontal, parietal and mediotemporal regions bilaterally and in the lingual and fusiform gyri on the left. Direct comparison of early and late items identified clusters with significantly greater activation for early acquired items at the <b>occipital</b> <b>poles</b> (in the posterior parts of the middle occipital gyri) and at the left temporal pole. In contrast, the left middle occipital and fusiform gyri showed significantly greater activation for late than early acquired items. We propose that greater activation to early than late objects at the <b>occipital</b> <b>poles</b> and at the left temporal pole reflects the more detailed visual and semantic representations of early than late acquired items. We propose that greater activation to late than early objects in the left middle occipital and fusiform gyri occurs because those areas are involved in mapping visual onto semantic representations, which is more difficult, and demands more resource, for late than for early items. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{occipital}} lobe {{contains a}} retinotopic {{representation of the}} visual field.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the connectivity, asymmetry and segmentation patterns of this bundle. High angular diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) analysis was performed on ten healthy adults and a 90 -subject DSI template (NTU- 90 Atlas). In addition, a new tractography approach based on the anatomic subregions and two regions of interest (ROI) was evaluated for the fiber reconstructions. More widespread anterior-posterior connections than previous standard definition of the IFOF were found. This distinct pathway demonstrated a greater inter-subjects connective variability with a maximum of 40 % overlap in its central part. The statistical results revealed no asymmetry between {{the left and right}} hemispheres and no significant differences existed in distributions of the IFOF according to sex. In addition, five subcomponents within the IFOF were identified according to the frontal areas of originations. As the subcomponents passed through the anterior floor of the external capsule, the fibers radiated to the posterior terminations. The most common connection patterns of the subcomponents were as follows: IFOF-I, from frontal polar cortex to <b>occipital</b> <b>pole,</b> inferior occipital lobe, middle occipital lobe, superior occipital lobe and pericalcarine; IFOF-II, from orbito-frontal cortex to <b>occipital</b> <b>pole,</b> inferior occipital lobe, middle occipital lobe, superior occipital lobe and pericalcarine; IFOF-III, from inferior frontal gyrus to inferior occipital lobe, middle occipital lobe, superior occipital lobe, <b>occipital</b> <b>pole</b> and pericalcarine; IFOF-IV, from middle frontal gyrus to <b>occipital</b> <b>pole</b> and inferior occipital lobe; IFOF-V, from superior frontal gyrus to <b>occipital</b> <b>pole,</b> inferior occipital lobe and middle occipital lobe.

Using this method, we aimed to identify regional vulnerability, which was hypothesized to provide (i) insight in pathogenic mechanisms and (ii) early prognostic parameters. On day 1 post-resuscitation, 18 -Fluor deoxyglucose ([F 18]-FDG) indicated a marked decrease of cerebral metabolic activity. Gray matter glucose consumption was 54 % of normal values, whereas white matter uptake was 70 % of normal. Regional differences followed a pattern of neuronal density rather than specific patterns of functionally or biochemically defined regions or of vascular territories. In contrast to [F 18]-FDG. the distribution of 15 -oxygen labeled water ([O- 15]-water) showed a better demarcation between gray and white matter, whereas focal deficit was not observed. In some patients, hyperperfusion relative to regional glucose consumption was observed in the <b>occipital</b> <b>poles</b> and basal ganglia. This suggests loss of vascular tone, i. e. vascular paralysis, in the basilar artery territory. CT and MR 1 scanning did not show any major change with respect to the hypoxic injury.

The comparison between survivors and nonsurvivors did not reveal obvious differences in PET data, suggesting that this technique does not provide major prognostic clues adding to the prognostic information derived from serial neurological assessment in the restricted patient group characterized by prolonged coma.

40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) {{is a rare}} degenerative disorder {{characterized by}} loss of upper and lower motor neurons. Neuroimaging has provided noticeable evidence that ALS is a complex disease, and shown that anatomical and functional lesions extend beyond precentral cortices and corticospinal tracts, to include the corpus callosum; frontal, sensory, and premotor cortices; thalamus; and midbrain. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate graph theory-based functional network abnormalities at voxel-wise level in ALS patients on a whole brain scale. Forty-three ALS patients and 44 age- and sex- matched healthy volunteers were enrolled. The voxel-wise network degree centrality (DC), a commonly employed graph-based measure of network organization, was used to characterize the alteration of whole brain functional network. Compared with the controls, the ALS patients showed significant increase of DC in the left cerebellum posterior lobes, bilateral cerebellum crus, bilateral <b>occipital</b> <b>poles,</b> right orbital frontal lobe and bilateral prefrontal lobes; significant decrease of DC in the bilateral primary motor cortex, bilateral sensory motor region, right prefrontal lobe, left bilateral precuneus, bilateral lateral temporal lobes, left cingulate cortex, and bilateral visual processing cortex. The DC’s z-scores of right inferior occipital gyrus were significant negative correlated with the ALSFRS-r scores. Our findings confirm that the regions with abnormal network DC in ALS patients were located in multiple brain regions including primary motor, somatosensory and extra-motor areas, supporting the concept that ALS is a multisystem disorder. Specifically, our study found that DC in the visual areas was altered and ALS patients with higher DC in right inferior occipital gyrus have more severity of disease. The result demonstrated that the altered DC value in this region can probably be used to assess severity of ALS...|$|R
40|$|Anatomical asymmetries of {{the human}} brain are a topic of major {{interest}} because of their link with handedness and cognitive functions. Their emergence and occurrence have been extensively explored in human fossil records to document the evolution of brain capacities and behaviour. We quantified for the first time antero-posterior endocranial shape asymmetries in large samples of great apes, modern humans and fossil hominins through analysis of "virtual" 3 D models of skull and endocranial cavity and we statistically test for departures from symmetry. Once based on continuous variables, we show that the analysis of these brain asymmetries gives original results that build upon previous analysis based on discrete traits. In particular, it emerges that the degree of petalial asymmetries differs between great apes and hominins without modification of their pattern. We indeed demonstrate the presence of shape asymmetries in great apes, with a pattern similar to modern humans but with a lower variation and a lower degree of fluctuating asymmetry. More importantly, variations in the position of the frontal and <b>occipital</b> <b>poles</b> on the right and left hemispheres would be expected to show some degree of antisymmetry when population distribution is considered, but the observed pattern of variation among the samples is related to fluctuating asymmetry for most of the components of the petalias. Moreover, the presence of a common pattern of significant directional asymmetry for two components of the petalias in hominids implicates that the observed traits were probably inherited from the last common ancestor of extant African great apes and Homo sapiens. These results also have important implications for the possible relationships between endocranial shape asymmetries and functional capacities in hominins. It emphasizes the uncoupling between lateralized activities, some of them well probably distinctive to Homo, and large-scale cerebral lateralization itself, which is not unique to Homo. © 2012 Balzeau et al.

If you are the author or principal advisor of this work and would like to request open access for it, please contact us at open-help@bu. edu. Thank you. A set of widely distributed brain areas, collectively known as the fronto-parietal network, serve to modulate aspects of visual perception. However, the unique influence exerted by these regions on low-level visual processing remains unclear. The goals of this thesis were (1) to examine how right frontal, parietal and occipital brain areas interact to process and modulate visual function and (2) to investigate the ability to improve foveal visual performance by means of noninvasive neurostimulation. In a first set of experiments, visual percepts known as 'phosphenes' were measured following low-frequency neurostimulation of the right <b>occipital</b> <b>pole,</b> Intraparietal Sulcus (IPS) or Frontal Eye Fields (FEF). Stimulation of the <b>occipital</b> <b>pole</b> and IPS were capable of evoking phosphenes with similar appearances. Furthermore, occipital or IPS stimulation decreased the excitability of the locally stimulated region but had no effect on the non-stimulated brain area. These results indicate a lack of sufficient inter-regional interactions capable of supporting long-range changes in brain activity. In a second set of experiments, contrast sensitivity and reaction times were assessed as the capacity to detect centrally located, high or low spatial frequency stimuli. Low-frequency rTMS to the FEF, but not the <b>occipital</b> <b>pole</b> or IPS improved contrast sensitivity for high spatial frequency stimuli. Stimulation of the <b>occipital</b> <b>pole</b> decreased reaction times for low spatial frequency stimuli and was shown to depend on transcollicular projections. Finally, stimulation of the IPS decreased reaction times for both types of stimuli. These effects however did not appear to depend on transcollicular pathways, indicating that performance was enhanced through cortico-cortical connections. In a final set of experiments, we investigated whether patterns of individual white matter connectivity linking stimulated brain regions could predict the effects of neurostimulation on visual processing and performance. None of the probability measures however correlated with changes in visual performance. Overall, these data suggest that occipital, parietal, frontal and tectal areas uniquely contribute to the modulation of visual perception. Moreover, results show that targeted stimulation to these brain regions serves to generate lasting improvements in visual performance, which could be used to enhance aspects of vision in healthy and clinical populations...|$|E

40|$|This study {{develops}} a hypothesis {{on the origin}} and nature of spatial frequency lateralization that {{is grounded in the}} biology of the visual system, and demonstrates its potential validity using a neural network model. Computational experiments show that differences in the timing of development of the magnocellular and parvocellular systems coupled with asynchronous maturation of the hemispheres could result in the development of hard-wired asymmetry that biases the processing of spatial frequencies. The results provide evidence that this hard-wired asymmetry has the potential to explain both the absolute and the relative frequency lateralization effects observed in psychophysical experiments. This evidence is utilized to support a theoretical model that explains the relative frequency lateralization effect in terms of an interaction between task-driven spatial attention and eccentricity-dependent frequency lateralization. Both the computational model demonstrating the basis of asymmetric development and lateralized spatial frequency processing, and the theoretical model illustrating the basis of the relative frequency lateralization effect, are specified in terms of neural structures and processes in the visual system. Two theories previously developed at an abstract level, namely, the Hellige theory on lateralized spatial frequency development and the Ivry and Robertson Double Filtering by Frequency theory of relative frequency lateralization (as applied to the visual system) are effectively made operational by this biological specification. The hard-wired asymmetry that develops in the computational experiments exhibits a hemispheric bias based primarily on spatial frequency. There is also evidence of a secondary bias related to the visual pathways. The pathway bias happens to be opposite in direction from that proposed by other researchers to explain temporal frequency lateralization effects observed in electrophysiological investigations on visual frequency processing. This contradiction is addressed by postulating that the electrophysiological lateralization effects arise from known anatomical asymmetries {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>occipital</b> <b>poles</b> rather than from actual processing differences. This contention is supported through computational modeling of the dipole potential-VEP wave relationship. The model results demonstrate that dipole asymmetry attributable to anatomical differences could produce the observed lateralization effects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Most {{olfactory}} testings are {{subjective and}} since they depend upon the patients' response, they are prone to false positive results. The {{aim of this study}} was to use quantitative brain perfusion SPECT in order to detect possible areas of brain activation in response to odorant stimulation in patients with post-traumatic impaired smell in comparison to a group of normal subjects. Methods Fourteen patients with post-traumatic impaired smell and ten healthy controls were entered in this prospective study. All subjects underwent brain SPECT after intravenous injection of 740 -MBq 99 m Tc-ECD and 48 hours later, the same procedure was repeated following olfactory stimulus (vanilla powder). Results In most of seven regions of interest (Orbital Frontal Cortex, Inferior Frontal Pole, Superior Frontal Pole, Posterior Superior Frontal Lobe, Parasagittal Area, <b>Occipital</b> <b>Pole,</b> and Cerebellar area) the post-stimulation quantitative values show increased cortical perfusion being more pronounced in normal volunteers than the anosmic patients (except cerebellar areas and the right <b>occipital</b> <b>pole).</b> Maximal activation was observed in orbitofrontal regions (right+ 25. 45 % and left + 25. 47 %). Conclusion Brain SPECT is a valuable imaging technique in the assessment of post-traumatic anosmia and could be competitive as an alternative to other imaging techniques, especially when functional MRI is unavailable or unsuitable. However, this procedure may benefit from complementary MRI or CT anatomical imaging. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Using surface-based morphometry we {{aimed to}} provide a {{detailed}} examination of cortical alterations in medication-overuse headache (MOH), by disentangling between altered cortical thickness and gyrification (folding). BACKGROUND: In MOH, pain modulation is probably dysfunctional at the cortical and subcortical level, resulting in a disequilibrium between pain inhibition and facilitation. Both increased and decreased cortical volumes {{have been reported in}} individuals with MOH. There is however no detailed examination to date that distinguishes between altered cortical thickness and gyrification. Such distinction would help to identify the nature and timing of neurodevelopmental mechanisms at play in affected individuals. METHODS: We investigated cortical thickness and gyrification in 29 patients with MOH according to International Headache Society criteria and 29 age- and gender-matched controls, using high-resolution structural MRIs of the brain analyzed with FreeSurfer. This is a secondary analysis of data from a previously published voxel-based morphometry study. RESULTS: In patients with MOH compared to controls, reduced cortical thickness was observed in the left prefrontal cortex. We also observed higher local gyrification in one cluster extending from the fusiform cortex to adjacent medial temporal regions, and in another cluster in the right <b>occipital</b> <b>pole.</b> Higher gyrification in the right <b>occipital</b> <b>pole</b> predicted poor response after detoxification. CONCLUSIONS: Corroborating previous volumetric results, our study adds information on the putative neurobiological mechanisms involved in MOH, suggesting neurodevelopmental changes in MOH...|$|E
