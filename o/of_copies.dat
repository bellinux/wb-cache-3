40|$|This report {{analyzes}} the economic {{effects of the}} reproduction of intellectual property, i e., books, journals, computer software, and audiovisual materials. A general economic model is presented in which direct appropriability (the marginal cost <b>of</b> <b>copying</b> is constant) and indirect appropriability (the marginal cost <b>of</b> <b>copying</b> is rising) appear as particular outcomes arising from particular assumptions regarding the marginal costs <b>of</b> <b>copying.</b> The model focuses on two aspects of private copying: {{the extent to which}} originals and copies are substitutes for consumers, and the technology for making copies from originals. Variants of the basic model, each of which is defined by a characterization <b>of</b> <b>copying</b> technology and substitutability, are examined in three cases. The model is then applied to the proble', of determining the royalties to be charged for making copies. The analysis in this report indicates that the effects <b>of</b> private <b>copying</b> differ considerably depending on the assumptions regarding the substitutability between originals and copies and the relative casts <b>of</b> producing <b>copies</b> and originals, which has important implications for the appropriate public policy to Fursue regarding such copying.

He was honored with annual Riley Day celebrations around the United States and was regularly called on to perform readings at national civic events.

40|$|This {{research}} project investigates the paradox <b>of</b> the <b>copy</b> through experimental print-media methods. It examines the copy {{as a primary}} component of social change and as a transformative act usually associated with concepts of the original. The paradox <b>of</b> <b>copying</b> as apparent in processes of mimicry in human interaction is positioned and evidenced through the visual culture of printmaking, performance, painting and sculpture by means of mechanical, electronic or manual reproduction. The conceptual and theoretical frameworks of the research serve to emphasise the shift from the 20 th-century notion of the original to the less definitive current status <b>of</b> the <b>copy</b> as evidenced in print-media practices and social change. The research identifies specific historical periods in which copying can be recognised {{as an agent of}} cultural change. The project has articulated alternative interpretations <b>of</b> <b>copying</b> through a print-informed investigation. This approach has aided a multi-artform practice that challenges and reveals the significance <b>of</b> <b>copying</b> through collaborative and individual methods of production, enabling a greater insight into concepts and methodologies of copy-based art making. Through a sustained enquiry using processes of duplication, repetition and performance, artwork outcomes demonstrate the generative nature <b>of</b> <b>copying.</b> The final artworks of the project contribute to understandings of copy-based art-making through an investigation <b>of</b> <b>copying</b> and mimicry as a method to stimulate change in social interaction...|$|R

5|$|A B cell {{identifies}} pathogens when antibodies on {{its surface}} bind to a specific foreign antigen. This antigen/antibody complex is {{taken up by the}} B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides {{on its surface}} MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.|$|E

Despite the fact that Anderson had not written Desolate North with the intention of it ever being released, in 2006, it was released by Bindrune Recordings. The CD version released by Bindrune Recordings is now out of print. However, in 2011, the album was rereleased in vinyl LP format by Handmade Birds, and the album remains available in digital format.|$|E

Furthermore, the semigroup which is a disjoint union <b>of</b> finitely many <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> a finitely presented (residually finite) group is finitely presented (residually finite) semigroup. The constructions of the semigroup which is a disjoint union <b>of</b> two <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the free monogenic semigroup are parallel to the constructions of the semigroup which is a disjoint union <b>of</b> two <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> a group, i. e. such a semigroup is Clifford (strong semilattice of groups) or Rees matrix semigroup. However, the semigroup which is a disjoint union <b>of</b> three <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the free monogenic semigroup is not just a strong semillatice of semigroups, Rees matrix semigroup or combination between a Rees matrix semigroup and a semigroup, but there are two more semigroups which do not arise from the constructions of the semigroup which is a disjoint union <b>of</b> three <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> a group. We also classify semigroups which are disjoint unions of two or three <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the free monogenic semigroup.
