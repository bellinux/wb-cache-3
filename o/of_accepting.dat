40|$|Pulak and Al-Sultan {{presented}} a rectifying inspection plan applying in {{the determination of}} optimum process mean. However, they did not point out whether the non-conforming items in the sample <b>of</b> <b>accepted</b> lot are replaced or eliminated from the lot and neglected the quality loss within specification limits. In this paper, we further propose the modified Pulak and Al-Sultan model with quadratic quality loss function. There are four cases considered in the modified model: (1) the non-conforming items in the sample <b>of</b> <b>accepted</b> lot are neither replaced nor eliminated from the lot; (2) the non-conforming items in the sample <b>of</b> <b>accepted</b> lot are not replaced but are eliminated from the lot;�(3) the non-conforming items in the sample <b>of</b> <b>accepted</b> lot are replaced by conforming ones; (4) the non-conforming items in the sample <b>of</b> <b>accepted</b> lot are replaced by non-inspected items. The numerical results and sensitivity analysis of parameters show that their solutions are slightly different. rectifying inspection plan, process mean, quadratic quality loss function, specification limits,...|$|R

5|$|Napoleon, {{expecting to}} win the war, delayed too long and lost this opportunity; by December the Allies had {{withdrawn}} the offer.

The Allies now had new, harsher terms that included the retreat of France to its 1791 boundaries, which meant the loss of Belgium. Napoleon would remain Emperor, however he rejected the term.

5|$|An {{example of}} someone {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} <b>of</b> <b>accepting</b> the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]]. A theologian who wrote on {{the distinction between the}} 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.|$|E

Two batmen were initially found guilty <b>of</b> <b>accepting</b> the gold, keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message, but the evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{massacre}} of the Uchiha clan {{at the start of}} the series, there were only four living people who possess the Sharingan: Sasuke Uchiha; his brother, Itachi; Obito Uchiha; and Kakashi Hatake. Itachi had died prior to the Fourth Great Ninja War, in which Obito meets his demise while Kakashi has his Sharingan removed in exchange for his normal eye. Years after the Great Ninja War, it is revealed that from one of Orochimaru's test subjects who has a unique ability <b>of</b> <b>accepting</b> tissue and organ transplantation, Shin Uchiha, came multiple clones of children having cloned Sharingan; the survivors are taken in by Konoha's orphanage.

5|$|Investigators {{found that}} Fall and a {{relative}} {{had received a}} total of about $400,000 from Doheny and Sinclair, and that the transfers were contemporaneous with the controversial leases.

Sinclair was convicted only of contempt of court for jury tampering.

5|$|Being {{popular in}} Australia with players {{as well as}} the public, Sargent made three lengthy tours of Australia and New Zealand in 1936. He was on the point <b>of</b> <b>accepting</b> a {{permanent}} appointment with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation when, at the outbreak of the Second World War, he felt it his duty to return to his country, resisting strong pressure from the Australian media for him to stay. During the war, Sargent directed the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester (1939–42) and the Liverpool Philharmonic (1942–48) and became a popular BBC Home Service radio broadcaster. He helped boost public morale during the war by extensive concert tours around the country conducting for nominal fees. On one famous occasion, an air raid interrupted a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7. Sargent stopped the orchestra, calmed the audience by saying they were safer inside the hall than fleeing outside, and resumed conducting. He later said that no orchestra had ever played so well and that no audience in his experience had ever listened so intently. In May 1941 Sargent conducted the last performance held in the Queen's Hall. Following an afternoon performance of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius, the hall was destroyed during a night-time incendiary raid.|$|E

While this was met by negative reactions from politicians, especially in Weizsäcker's own party, he nevertheless led the Evangelical Church on a way to promoting reconciliation with Poland, leading to a memorandum by the Church in both West and East Germany. The paper was widely discussed and met with a significantly more positive response.|$|E
