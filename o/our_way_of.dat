500|$|While {{there are}} certain aspects readers can almost always expect in García Márquez's writing, like {{instances}} of humour, he did not stick to any clear and predetermined style template. In an interview with Marlise Simons, García Márquez noted:In every book I {{try to make a}} different path [...] One doesn't choose the style. You can investigate and try to discover what the best style would be for a theme. But the style is determined by the subject, by the mood of the times.

500|$|The {{album is}} lyrically {{consumed}} with sorrow and {{uncertainty about the}} world.

[...] "I think at this point in our career, we are better musicians and we've evolved <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> thinking as far as songwriting", DeLonge told Billboard in reference to the more mature lyricism. Hoppus, in his interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, described the lyrics as the most personal he had written to that point. While past recordings tended to meditate on feelings from high school, the band felt it was akin to a safety net and desired to write about [...] "what's going on [...] right now." [...] Lyrics continued to be autobiographical, but the band took more time than usual on their writing. DeLonge would routinely rewrite his sections upwards of four times.|$|E

500|$|The {{band has}} said the idea of wearing masks stemmed from a clown mask that Crahan took to rehearsals when the band first started. Crahan later became known for his clown masks, {{adopting}} the pseudonym [...] "Shawn the Clown". The concept developed; by late 1997, the band decided every band member would wear a unique mask and matching jumpsuit. Taylor said in 2002, [...] "it's <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> becoming more intimate with the music. It's a {{way for us to}} become unconscious of who we are and what we do outside of music. It's a way for us to kind of crawl inside it and be able to use it." [...] The concept of wearing matching jumpsuits {{has been described as a}} response to commercialism in the music industry and led to the idea of assigning the band members numerical aliases. According to Taylor, [...] "Originally, we were just going to wear the jumpsuits...we figured we might as well take that further and number ourselves...We were basically saying, 'Hey, we're a product!'".|$|E
500|$|In Peng's letter, Peng {{compared}} {{himself to}} the courageous but tactless Han dynasty general Zhang Fei. Because of Mao's appreciation of Zhang's enemy, Cao Cao, Mao interpreted this as implying a confrontational relationship. Peng criticized the poor allocation of labour across China, especially the inefficient, country-wide practice of forcing farmers to work in backyard furnaces. He criticized the nationwide famine and severe shortage of cotton, and stated that the Chinese people were justified in demanding change from the present conditions. Peng blamed {{the problems of the}} Great Leap on what he called [...] "problems in <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> thinking and style of work", especially the tendency for Party administrators to submit exaggerated production reports, and for Party bureaucrats to accept these figures uncritically. Peng blamed the mistakes of the Party on a culture of [...] "petty bourgeois fanaticism", a tendency to believe in achieving change through blindly encouraging mass movements, and claimed that the acceptance of this culture had led to the Party leadership forgetting [...] "the mass-line and the style of seeking truth from facts", which Peng believed had led to the Communist victories over the Japanese and Kuomintang. Peng criticized Mao's policy of [...] "putting politics in command", substituting economic principles and productive work for political objectives.|$|E
500|$|The Punch {{serialisation}} attracted little critical comment; The Athenaeums {{literary critic}} thought the series [...] "may have escaped unnoticed amid better jokes". When the Diary was published as a book, Punch heralded {{it in its}} issue of 23 July 1892 as [...] "very funny", adding: [...] "not without a touch of pathos". However, apart from a warmly approving report in The Saturday Review, the book's initial critical reception was lukewarm. The Reviews critic thought the book [...] "admirable, and in some of its touches [...] goes close to genius", with a natural and irresistible appeal: [...] "The Diary has amused us from cover to cover". This contrasted with the negative judgement of The Athenaeum, which opined that [...] "the book has no merit to compensate for its hopeless vulgarity, not even that of being amusing". It questioned the tastefulness of jokes aimed almost exclusively at the poverty of underpaid city clerks, and concluded: [...] "Besides, it is all so dull". [...] The Speakers critic thought the book [...] "a study in vulgarity", while The New York Times, reviewing the first American edition, found the work largely incomprehensible: [...] "There {{is that kind of}} quiet, commonplace, everyday joking in it which we are to suppose is highly satisfactory to our cousins across the water... <b>Our</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> manufacturing fun is different". Although details of sales figures are not given, Arrowsmiths later acknowledged that the early editions of the book did not have a wide public impact.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{described}} as an anti-war film, as civilians run and only try to save themselves and their family instead of fighting back against the alien Tripods. Debra J. Saunders of San Francisco Chronicle described the film as [...] "If aliens invade, don't fight back. Run." [...] Saunders compared the film to Independence Day, where the civilians do run, but they support the military efforts. Many reviewers considered the film tried to recreate {{the atmosphere of the}} September 11 attacks, with bystanders struggling to survive and the usage of missing-persons displays. Spielberg declared to Reader's Digest that beside the work being a fantasy, the threat represented was real: [...] "They are a wake-up call to face our fears as we confront a force intent on destroying <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life." [...] Screenwriter David Koepp stated that he tried not to put explicit references to September 11 or the Iraq War, but said that the inspiration for the scene where Robbie joins the Marines was teenagers fighting in the Gaza Strip – [...] "I was thinking of teenagers in Gaza throwing bottles and rocks at tanks, and I think that when you're that age you don't fully consider the ramifications of what you're doing and you're very much caught up in the moment and passion, whether that's a good idea or not." [...] Retained from the novel is the aliens being defeated, not by men's weapons, but the planet's smallest creatures, bacteria, which Koepp described as [...] "nature, in a way, knowing a whole lot more than we do".|$|E
500|$|According to {{the game}} {{director}} Katsura Hashino, while [...] "ideas [...] thrown around earlier", development on Persona 4 in Japan did not begin until {{after the release of}} Persona 3. The development team consisted of the team from Persona 3 and new hires which included fans of Persona 3. Atlus intended to improve both the gameplay and story elements of Persona 3 for the new game, to ensure it was not seen as a [...] "retread" [...] of its predecessor. Hashino said that [...] "to accomplish that, we tried to give the players of Persona 4 a definite goal and a sense of purpose that would keep motivating them as they played through the game. The murder mystery plot was <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> doing that." [...] The plot of Persona 4 was [...] "greatly inspired", according to Hashino, by mystery novelists such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie and Seishi Yokomizo. Persona 4 was officially unveiled in the Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu in March 2008. An article in the issue detailed the game's murder mystery premise, rural setting, and new weather forecast system. The game's North American release date was announced at the 2008 Anime Expo in Los Angeles, California. Atlus would not make an add-on disc or epilogue for Persona 4, as had been done with the Persona 3 FES. Persona 4 allowed players full control of characters in battle. This was due to negative comments from players about most of the player team in Persona 3 being controlled by the game's AI. The amount of data the team ended up incorporating around school life, character relationships and spoke character dialogue was so large that there were fears it would not fit onto a single disc. The anime cutscenes were produced by Studio Hibari.|$|E

One day, he wakes up and sees that his dream has become a reality. However, he doesn't want to believe it and he tries to fall back asleep again. Chris Fehn said that [...] "Surfacing" [...] "basically encompasses everything. Kind of encompasses the attitude of the band and the attitude of how we feel about life: Don't judge me. Everything that you think that you know about the world, and about Slipknot, and about your own life, might not be the case. So I think it's just openmindedness and just be cool."
