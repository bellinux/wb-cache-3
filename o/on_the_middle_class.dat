5|$|While {{economic}} policies were the original motivating {{factor in the}} growing partisan split, foreign policy also became a factor. Though most Americans supported the French Revolution prior to the Execution of Louis XVI, some of Hamilton's followers began to fear the radical egalitarianism of the revolution as it became increasingly violent. Washington particularly feared British entrance into the war, as he worried that sympathy for France and hatred for Britain would propel the United States into the French Revolutionary Wars, to the ruin of the American economy. In 1793, after Britain entered the French Revolutionary Wars, several Democratic-Republican Societies were formed. These societies, centered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> of several eastern cities, opposed Hamilton's {{economic policies}} and supported France. Conservatives came to fear these societies as populist movements that sought to re-make the class order. That same year, the British began attacking American ships that were trading with France, fanning the flames of anti-British sentiment. As Washington continued to seek peace with Great Britain, critics finally began to attack the president himself.|$|E

25|$|Some modern {{theories}} of political economy consider a large middle class to be a beneficial, stabilizing influence on society, {{because it has}} neither the possibly explosive revolutionary tendencies of the lower class, nor the absolutist tendencies of an entrenched upper class. Most sociological definitions of middle class follow Max Weber. Here {{the middle class is}} defined as consisting of professionals or business owners who share a culture of domesticity and sub-urbanity and a level of relative security against social crisis, in the form of socially desired skill or wealth. Thus the theory <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> by Max Weber can be cited as one that supports the notion of the middle class being composed of a quasi-elite of professionals and managers, who are largely immune to economic downturns and trends such as out-sourcing which affect the statistical middle class.|$|E
25|$|Early on, McGuinty {{set down}} three {{strategic}} imperatives. First, no tax cuts. This ran against {{the conventional wisdom}} of politics {{that you had to}} offer tax cuts to win; everyone from Mike Harris to Bill Clinton had campaigned on reducing the tax burden <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> But McGuinty was determined that Ontario voters would accept that the money was needed to restore public health care and education services. Second, a positive tone. McGuinty wanted to avoid the typical opposition leader role of automatically opposing whatever the government announced, and instead, set the agenda with positive alternatives. While attacking your opponent was important, that would be left to caucus surrogates. Third, one big team. At the time, the Ontario Liberal Party was riven into factions. Peterson-era people distrusted more recent arrivals. Jean Chrétien supporters fought with Paul Martin supporters. McGuinty set a tone that divisions were left at the door.|$|E

500|$|As {{defined in}} the {{proposed}} legislation, the tax rate is 23% for the first year. [...] This percentage {{is based on the}} total amount paid including the tax ($23 out of every $100 spent in total). This would be equivalent to a 30% traditional U.S. sales tax ($23 on top of every $77 spent—$100 total). The rate would automatically adjust annually based on federal receipts in the previous fiscal year. With the rebate taken into consideration, the FairTax would be progressive on consumption, but would also be regressive on income at higher income levels (as consumption falls as a percentage of income). [...] Opponents argue this would accordingly decrease the tax burden on high-income earners and increase it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> Supporters contend that the plan would effectively tax wealth, increase purchasing power and decrease tax burdens by broadening the tax base.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the emotional negotiations that mark the lived experience of Britons residing in rural France—a paradigmatic case of lifestyle migration—to develop a nuanced {{understanding of how the}} lifestyle migrant subject is (re) constructed through migration and settlement.

It highlights the vaue of moving beyond narratives of migration into lived experience; it stresses the importance of recognising that even for <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> belonging is a project-in-progress rather than fait accompli; it promotes the idea of lifestyle migrants as translocal subjects, belonging further complicated by ongoing attachments to people and places elsewhere.
