5|$|The Waqf Ministry of Jordan held {{control of}} the al-Aqsa Mosque until the 1967 Six-Day War. After Israel's victory in that war, Israel {{transferred}} the {{control of the}} mosque and the northern Noble Sanctuary to the Islamic waqf trust, who are independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government.</b> However, Israeli Security Forces are permitted to patrol and conduct searches within the perimeter of the mosque. After the 1969 arson attack, the waqf employed architects, technicians and craftsmen in a committee that carry out regular maintenance operations. The Islamic Movement in Israel and the waqf have attempted to increase Muslim control of the Temple Mount as a way of countering Israeli policies and the escalating presence of Israeli security forces around the site since the Second Intifada. Some activities included refurbishing abandoned structures and renovating.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the most}} common reasons for {{emigration}} of Israeli Jews from Israel are economic constraints, economic characteristics (U.S. and Canada have always been richer nations than Israel), disappointment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government,</b> Israel's ongoing security issues, {{as well as the}} excessive role of religion in the lives of Israelis.|$|E

25|$|Grozovsky was {{a fierce}} {{opponent}} of Zionism and the State of Israel. He wrote several essays attacking the Zionist movement and describing how Haredim {{should deal with}} the State. These essays were later collected and published in the book Ba'ayos Hazman. In one essay, Grozovsky stressed that Agudath Israel differed from the extreme anti Zionist Neturei Karta only in tactics, not in ideology. He also participated in demonstrations against various actions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government,</b> and spoke against it in strong terms.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Grozovsky was {{extremely}} {{active in the}} Agudath Israel of America organization. However, he preferred to work behind the scenes. His concern for the spiritual state of affairs in Israel was well known. He read many magazine and newspaper article about Israel and asked students to translate articles written in English. As {{a result of his}} knowledge, in May 1951 he organized a public demonstration protesting the unilateral action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> in involuntarily sending religious refugee children to anti-religious kibbutzim ("communes").|$|E

25|$|In 1949, the World Jewish Congress {{called on}} the newly {{established}} Federal Republic of Germany to acknowledge responsibility and liability of the German people for the wrongs inflicted on the Jewish people by the Nazi regime. In 1950, the WJC opened an office in Frankfurt {{to function as a}} “listening post” on developments in Germany. In representations to the United States, Britain and France, the WJC detailed Jewish moral and material claims on Germany.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Ascalon founded an Israeli {{decorative}} arts manufacturing company, , which produced trademark bronze and brass menorahs and other Judaic and secular decorative art and functional {{items that were}} exported in large numbers worldwide. Maurice Ascalon's well-recognized designs, some art deco, others more traditional, introduced {{the use of a}} deliberate, chemically induced green patina (verdigris) to Israeli metalwork, which is now a hallmark of Israel's crafts industry. During Israel's War for Independence in 1948, Maurice designed munitions for the Israeli Army and, at the request <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government,</b> retrofitted his factory to produce munitions for the war effort. In 1956 Maurice immigrated to the United States.|$|E

Ben-Gurion emphatically rejected the return of refugees in the Israeli Cabinet decision of June 1948 reiterated {{in a letter to the}} UN of August 2, 1949 containing the text of a statement made by Moshe Sharett on August 1, 1948 where the basic attitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>Government</b> was that a solution must be sought, not through the return of the refugees to Israel, but through the resettlement of the Palestinian Arab refugee population in other states.|$|E

Yom Tov Samia, the Israeli Prime Minister's Foreign Media Advisor, Dr. Ra'anan Gissin, along with Daniel Seaman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>Government</b> Press Office (GPO) publicly challenged {{the accuracy of the}} France 2 report. In 2005, the head of the Israeli National Security Agency, Major-General (res.) Giora Eiland publicly retracted the IDF's initial admittance of responsibility. In order to avoid negative publicity and a resulting backlash, the IDF did not conduct its own official, military investigation until 2007. On October 1, 2007, Israel officially denied responsibility for the shooting and claimed that the France 2 footage had been staged, prompting criticism from Al-Durrah's father.|$|E
25|$|Relations between Cyprus and Israel {{have been}} {{excessively}} strong, thus many Cypriots and Israelis usually {{refer to it}} as Cypriot-Israeli brotherhood and consider the other nation an ally and a brother-nation. Cyprus and Israel consider each other as being the only two democracies in the Eastern Mediterranean, leading the leader of Democratic Rally Averof Neofytou in September 2013 to support that Israel is Cyprus most reliable partner. President of Israel Shimon Peres has claimed that Cyprus is Israel's most predictable neighbour. As a sign of the emotional bonding between Israel and Cyprus there has been a high level of exchange of representation for various events in both countries such as the representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> at the funeral of Cypriot fourth President Glafcos Clerides by the Israeli Minister of Tourism Uzi Landau in November 2013 and the visit of the Cypriot Minister of Defence Fotis Fotiou to the funeral of ex-Prime Minister of Israel Ariel Sharon.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1976, Israel had been {{assisting}} Lebanese Christian militias in their sporadic battles against the PLO. During Operation Litani in 1978, Israel established a security zone in southern Lebanon with mostly Christian inhabitants, {{in which they}} began to supply training and arms to Christian militias which would later form the South Lebanese Army. But Israel's main partner {{was to be the}} Maronite Phalange party, whose paramilitary was led by Bashir Gemayel, a rising figure in Lebanese politics. Gemayel's strategy during {{the early stages of the}} Lebanese Civil War was to provoke the Syrians into retaliatory attacks on Christians, such that Israel could not ignore. In 1978, Menachem Begin declared that Israel would not allow a genocide of Lebanese Christians, while refusing direct intervention. Hundreds of Lebanese militiamen began to train in Israel, at the IDF Staff and Command College. The relationship between Israel and the Maronites began to grow into a political-strategic alliance, and members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> like Ariel Sharon began to conceive of a plan to install a pro-Israel Christian government in Lebanon, as it was known that Bashir wanted to remove the PLO and all Palestinian refugees in the country.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the larger}} {{societal}} context of Bedouin culture is changing, {{particularly in the}} Negev. For the past several decades, the policy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> has been to move the Negev Bedouin from the desert to official settlements. This has had several significant effects on Negev Bedouin society. Significantly, the move from a nomadic lifestyle to a sedentary one has displaced the Bedouin women from their previously critical economic roles. Moreover, the shift to a sedentary lifestyle means that wage labor has largely replaced agriculture as the main economic structure for the Negev Bedouin. Traditionally, women in Negev Bedouin society {{were not allowed to}} work outside the home. This expectation is still in place today. As the Negev Bedouin have shifted away from agriculture, the productive responsibilities have shifted to the men. Meanwhile, the patriarchal system that developed around the traditional economic structure has been maintained. Ultimately, this has resulted in a loss of power within the household for Bedouin women. It is still considered culturally inappropriate for women to interact with strangers (especially strange men), and the men of the family still mediate their families' interactions with society as a whole. The loss of their economic capabilities has meant that Negev Bedouin women are increasingly excluded from decision-making within the household. As a result, the overwhelming majority of important household decisions are made by men.|$|E
500|$|Mandela {{expressed}} {{the view that}} [...] "South Africa's future foreign relations [...] be based on our belief that human rights should be the core of international relations". Following the South African example, Mandela encouraged other nations to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and reconciliation. In September 1998, Mandela was appointed Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement, who held their annual conference in Durban. He used the event to criticise the [...] "narrow, chauvinistic interests" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> in stalling negotiations to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and urged India and Pakistan to negotiate to end the Kashmir conflict, {{for which he was}} criticised by both Israel and India. Inspired by the region's economic boom, Mandela sought greater economic relations with East Asia, in particular with Malaysia, although this was prevented by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. He extended diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic of China (PRC), who were growing as an economic force, and initially also to Taiwan, who were already longstanding investors in the South African economy. However, under pressure from the PRC, in November 1996 he cut recognition of Taiwan, and in May 1999 paid an official visit to Beijing.|$|E
500|$|Livingstone {{describes}} himself as a socialist. In 1987, he stated that [...] "politics is my religion. It's my moral framework. I believe a socialist society is inherently the best thing, and that's like an act of faith." [...] In 2007, he stated that [...] "I still believe one day that the idea that the main means of production are owned by private individuals... will be considered as anti-democratic as the idea serfs could be tied to the land. But I will not be alive when that day comes." [...] Livingstone had always worked towards a unified socialist front on the British left, and disliked the tendency towards splintering and forming rival factions, usually over issues of political theory, among the socialist community. Although rejecting Marxism, throughout his political career he has worked alongside Marxist far-left groups and has become involved with the [...] "politics of the street". He has not worked with those Marxist groups, such as the Socialist Workers Party and the Revolutionary Communist Party, who advocate the destruction of the Labour Party as the way forward for socialism, seeing their beliefs as incompatible with his own. Livingstone has consistently opposed the actions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government.</b> In a 2005 interview {{he said that he was}} not against the existence of Israel, but rather Ariel Sharon's government; he recalled that on his 1986 visit to the country he got on well with its left-wing politicians.|$|E
