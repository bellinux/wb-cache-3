Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 70 - 80. The {{objective of}} this thesis {{is to find out}} whether <b>the</b> <b>US</b> is also genuinely committed to promote democracy in those countries <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> <b>US</b> has oil dependency or does <b>the</b> <b>US</b> energy security interest eclipse its foreign policy principle of democracy promotion abroad after 9 / 11. The hypothesis of this research is that <b>the</b> <b>US</b> is less interested in promoting democracy in those countries <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> <b>US</b> has higher oil-dependency. Materialist theory of democracy promotion is used to drive this hypothesis. Two statistical methods are employed, i. e. (1) hypothesis testing by using t-test and (2) regression, to estimate the variation of the USAID democracy assistance in those countries <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> <b>US</b> has higher oil dependency compared with those countries <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> <b>US</b> has less or no oil dependency. The findings of this thesis show that <b>the</b> USAID spends, <b>on</b> average, less funding for democracy-related programmes in those countries <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> <b>US</b> has higher oil-dependency and vice versa. These results indicate that, although <b>the</b> <b>US</b> prioritized its democracy promotion after 9 / 11 in order to tackle the problem of iv terrorism, <b>the</b> <b>US</b> energy security remains the prime concern for which <b>the</b> <b>US</b> compromises <b>on</b> its foreign policy principle of democracy promotion abroad.
