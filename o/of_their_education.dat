Established in Endicott, New York, the college was a branch of Syracuse University. Triple Cities College offered local students the first two years <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>education,</b> while the following two were spent at Syracuse University. In 1946, students could earn their degrees entirely at the Binghamton campus. In 1950, it was absorbed by the State University of New York and renamed Harpur College.|$|E
5|$|The gymnasia have forms which {{operate on}} a unit-credit system, {{that is to say}} a term is divided into course units, each of which is worth a certain number of credits.

This system is used in most upper secondary institutions in Iceland.|$|E
5|$|For several centuries, {{education}} {{at one of}} the Inns of Chancery was the first step towards becoming a barrister. A student would first join one of the Inns of Chancery, where he would be taught in the form of moots and rote learning. He would also be taught by Readers sent from the Inn of Court that his Inn of Chancery was attached to, who would preside over the moots and discuss cases with the students. At the end of each legal term, particularly promising students would be transferred to the parent Inn of Court and begin the next stage <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>education.</b> By 1461 there were approximately 100 students studying at the Inns of Chancery at any one time.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, primary {{education}} reform {{had become one}} of the top priorities in the People's Republic of China. About 160million Chinese people had missed all or part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>education</b> because of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and in 1986 the National People's Congress enacted a law calling for nine years of compulsory education. By 1993, it was clear that much of the country was making little progress on implementing nine-year compulsory education, so the 1993–2000seven-year plan focused on this goal. One of the major challenges educators faced was the large number of rural schoolchildren dropping out to pursue work. Another issue was a large urban–rural divide: funding and teacher quality were far better in urban schools than rural, and urban students stayed in school longer.|$|E

25|$|During the Nazi era (1933–1945), {{teaching}} of National Socialist ideology was {{integrated into the}} school system, however the basic education system remained unchanged. The Hitler Youth accepted students aged 7-18, and education often focused more on Nazism and Nazi-related activities, rather than traditional academic subjects.

25|$|Soon after this, Congress {{passed the}} {{landmark}} Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975; this completed a 15-year period of federal policy reform {{with regard to}} American Indian tribes. The legislation authorized processes by which tribes could negotiate contracts with the BIA to manage directly more <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>education</b> and social service programs. In addition, it provided direct grants to help tribes develop plans for assuming such responsibility. It also provided for Indian parents' participation on local school boards.|$|E
25|$|Spartan {{women were}} also literate and numerate, {{a rarity in}} the ancient world. Furthermore, as a result <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>education</b> {{and the fact that}} they moved freely in society {{engaging}} with their fellow (male) citizens, they were notorious for speaking their minds even in public. Plato, in the middle of the fourth century, described women's curriculum in Sparta as consisting of gymnastics and mousike (music and arts). Plato goes on to praise Spartan women's ability when it came to philosophical discussion.|$|E

Their diction is much more correct than the Sephardic and Ashkenazic dialect.

Thomas left Britannia in December 1877, but not before a friendship was established.

25|$|In {{modern times}} Cypriot art history {{begins with the}} painter Vassilis Vryonides (1883–1958) who studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice. Arguably the two {{founding}} fathers of modern Cypriot art were Adamantios Diamantis (1900–1994) who studied at London's Royal College of Art and Christopheros Savva (1924–1968) who also studied in London, at Saint Martin's School of Art. In many ways these two artists set the template for subsequent Cypriot art and both their artistic styles and the patterns <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>education</b> remain influential to this day. In particular the majority of Cypriot artists still train in England while others train at art schools in Greece and local art {{institutions such as the}} Cyprus College of Art, University of Nicosia and the Frederick Institute of Technology.|$|E
25|$|One of Attiya's {{greatest}} accomplishments {{was changing}} the way that yeshiva education was viewed in the Sephardic world.

Attiya did everything he could to enable boys to continue learning into their teens, many times offering to underwrite the costs <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>education.</b> In one case, a poor boy from Iraq applied for admission to the yeshiva but could not provide the necessary tuition. Attiya went to Rabbi Ben Zion Chazan, the yeshiva's founder and secretary, and offered to reduce his own salary to accommodate the boy. Rabbi Chazan then offered to reduce his own salary as well.
