5|$|Oskar's classmates {{regularly}} bully him, and {{he spends}} his evenings imagining revenge, collecting clippings from {{newspapers and magazines}} about grisly murders. One night he meets Eli, {{who appears to be}} a pale girl of his age. Eli has recently moved into the next-door apartment with an older man, Håkan. Eli initially informs Oskar that they cannot be friends. Over time, however, they begin to form a close relationship, with Oskar lending his Rubik's Cube to Eli, and the two exchanging Morse code messages through their adjoining wall. Håkan requests that Eli stop seeing Oskar. After questioning Oskar about a cut <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> Eli learns that the boy is being bullied by schoolmates and encourages him to stand up for himself. This inspires Oskar to enroll for weight-training classes after school.|$|E

25|$|The game's protagonist and {{the main}} playable character. Jaster is {{seventeen}} years old, and has a distinctive birthmark <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek.</b> He lives on the planet of Rosa with his adoptive father, Raul (Peter Renaday), where he works in the agricultural sector. Resentful of the presence on the planet of the Longardian army, he yearns to leave and explore space.

25|$|A music video, {{directed}} by Philip R. Lopez, {{was released on}} 24 April 2017 on Kygo's official Vevo channel. The video revolves around a couple involved in a motorcycle accident. The boyfriend (played by Nathan Mitchell) is rendered comatose while the girlfriend (played by Georgia Fowler) sits in the hospital room, watching over him. In his comatose state, the boyfriend imagines walking through a forest and coming across his lover in a dress. At various points, she is seen handling butterflies. The two slowly break into dance in the dream world, which coincides with the girlfriend dancing around the hospital room in reality. Eventually the boyfriend awakens from his coma, {{only to find that}} he is alone in his hospital room. A butterfly is seen perched <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tom {{suffers a}} serious wound <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> and the camp guards realize {{it will not}} be {{difficult}} to identify him. That evening the family hides Tom under the mattresses of the truck just as guards arrive to question them; they are searching for the man who killed the guard. Tom avoids being spotted and the family leaves the Keene Ranch without further incident. After driving for a while, they have to stop {{at the top of a}} hill when the engine overheats due to a broken fan belt; they have little gas, but decide to try coasting down the hill to some lights. The lights are from a third type of camp: Farmworkers' Wheat Patch Camp (Weedpatch in the book), a clean camp run by the Department of Agriculture, complete with indoor toilets and showers, which the Joad children had never seen before.|$|E
25|$|After {{witnessing}} {{the death of}} Conquering Bear at the Grattan massacre, Crazy Horse began to get trance visions. Curly went out on a vision quest to seek guidance but without going through the traditional procedures first. In his vision, a warrior on his horse rode out of a lake and the horse seemed to float and dance throughout the vision. He wore simple clothing, no face paint, his hair down with just a feather in it, and a small brown stone behind his ear. Bullets and arrows flew around him as he charged forward, but {{neither he nor his}} horse were hit. A thunderstorm came over the warrior, and his people grabbed hold of his arms trying to hold him back. The warrior broke their hold and then lightning struck him, leaving a lightning symbol <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> and white marks like hailstones appeared on his body. The warrior told Curly that as long he dressed modestly, his tribesmen did not touch him, and he did not take any scalps or war trophies, then he would not be harmed in battle. As the vision ended, he heard a red-tailed hawk shrieking off in the distance. Curly’s father later interpreted the vision and said that the warrior was going to be him. The lightning bolt <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> and the hailstones on his body were to become his war paint. Curly was to follow the warrior’s role to dress modestly and to do as the warrior's prophecy said so he would be unharmed in battle. For the most part, the vision was true and Crazy Horse was rarely harmed in battle, except for when he was struck by an arrow after taking two enemy scalps. He was shot in the face by No Water when Little Big Man tried to hold Crazy Horse back to prevent a fight from breaking out, and he was held back by one of his tribesmen—according to some reports, Little Big Man himself—when he was stabbed by a bayonet the night he died.|$|E

25|$|On 6 November 1990, Chikatilo {{killed and}} {{mutilated}} a 22-year-old woman, named Svetlana Korostik, in woodland near Donleskhoz station. While leaving the crime scene, he was observed by an undercover officer. The policeman observed Chikatilo approach a well and wash {{his hands and}} face. When he approached the station, the undercover officer noted that Chikatilo's coat had grass and soil stains on the elbows. Chikatilo also had a small red smear <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek.</b> To the officer, he looked suspicious. The only reason people entered woodland near the station {{at that time of}} year was to gather wild mushrooms (a popular pastime in Russia), but Chikatilo was not dressed like a typical forest scavenger; he was wearing more formal attire. Moreover, he had a nylon sports bag, which was unsuitable for carrying mushrooms. The policeman stopped Chikatilo and checked his papers, but had no formal reason to arrest him. When the policeman returned to his office, he filed a routine report, containing the name of the person he had stopped at the station.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the male}} protagonists of NOW. A good person at first but is becomes twisted and evil by a {{traumatic}} incident in the first volume. Originally sent with his brothers to destroy Sashinmu's secrets upon his swordmaster's last wishes. He discovered his older brother had secretly been working for an opposing force, and was nearly killed by him. It was this brother's sword that left the scar <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek.</b> Together, the two plunge into a chasm, and he barely survived unlike his brother. He acquires the Sashinmu killing technique from reading the Sashinmu book {{with the purpose of}} changing the world so as to acknowledge his strength and, indirectly, his reason for existing. Yu Sae-Ha's style of Sashinmu is unique, for it utilizes negative (ice / Yin) ki instead of positive (fire / Yang) ki, as a result of him having absorbed Yhun Ah-Ran's ki. Originally starting out as a shy and timid character, Yu Sae-Ha grows obsessed with power as the story goes on, willing to do anything to become stronger. He harbors feelings for Yhun Ah-Ran.|$|E
25|$|Brabourne hosted 17 Test matches between 1948 and 1973, {{starting}} with two matches against the West Indies in India's first home series after the World War II in 1948–49. The first test {{to produce a}} result at the Brabourne was the fourth it hosted, when India beat Pakistan in 1952. India won their first ever test series after taking a 2–1 lead {{on the basis of}} this victory. Vijay Hazare scored a hundred in each of his four test match appearances at the ground, the most by any player. Indian batsman Abbas Ali Baig became the first Indian cricketer to be kissed on a cricket field during the third Test between India and Australia at the Brabourne in 1960. When Baig reached the fifty run mark, a young woman ran onto the ground from the North Stand and kissed him <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> in full view of a packed crowd. During a test match in 1964, several members of the visiting England team faced fitness issues, forcing England to request India to provide a substitute fielder. On successive days, A. G. Kripal Singh and Hanumant Singh took the field as substitutes for Micky Stewart.|$|E
60|$|Thomas seemed surprised, but not alarmed. His {{eyes grew}} a little rounder, and the pink <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> deepened. He {{looked like a}} choir-boy in a bad temper.|$|R

25|$|Stephen and Stirling {{moved their}} {{divisions}} without incident, {{even though their}} troops were coming under fire from the enemy's light troops. De Borre somehow mismanaged the shift of Sullivan's division. Instead of simply moving to the right, the Frenchman ordered the division to file {{off to the left}} and circle back to the northeast. At the end of the bizarre maneuver, the 1st Brigade was in almost the same position it started. Instead of being alongside the 1st Brigade, the 2nd Brigade was behind it. At this moment, the crack Brigade of Guards supported by two 12-pound cannons attacked. When the sound of gunfire erupted, the confused soldiers of the 2nd Brigade volleyed into the backs of the 1st Brigade. The 1st Maryland Regiment put up some resistance, suffering 26 casualties, but the entire division soon crumbled. The soldiers headed to the rear pursued by the British Guards. De Borre later stated to Samuel Smith of the 4th Maryland that a wound <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> was caused by the English firing fish hooks. Smith suspected that de Borre misrepresented his injury and that it was caused by riding through some briars. Since it led the column of march, Hazen's regiment apparently did not take part in de Borre's maneuver and instead joined Stirling's left flank.|$|E
500|$|As the American Civil War was beginning, Whitman {{published}} his poem [...] "" [...] as a patriotic rally {{call for the}} North. Whitman's brother George had joined the Union army and began sending Whitman several vividly detailed letters of the battle front. On December 16, 1862, a listing of fallen and wounded soldiers in the New York Tribune included [...] "First Lieutenant G. W. Whitmore", which Whitman worried was a reference to his brother George. He made his way south immediately to find him, though his wallet was stolen on the way. [...] "Walking all day and night, unable to ride, trying to get information, trying {{to get access to}} big people", Whitman later wrote, he eventually found George alive, with only a superficial wound <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek.</b> Whitman, profoundly affected by seeing the wounded soldiers and the heaps of their amputated limbs, left for Washington on December 28, 1862, with the intention of never returning to New York.|$|E
500|$|The finale {{marked the}} return of actor Kirk Acevedo as the Other Side FBI agent Charlie Francis. In the DVD audio commentary, the {{producers}} admit they [...] "faced a bit of hatred" [...] when they killed off Acevedo's character {{near the beginning of}} the season. [...] They were aware the entire time that Charlie exists in the parallel universe, and that [...] "nobody ever dies on Fringe. Acevedo describes the parallel universe version of his character as someone who is [...] "so much more fun." [...] He is subtly different, with a lighter personality; he jokes around more, and is less [...] "doom and gloom" [...] than the original character. Some viewers refer to the new character as [...] "alt-Charlie" [...] to differentiate the two. The actor, the producers, and some fans have called the new character [...] "Scarlie" [...] in reference to a scar <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> which takes ten minutes to apply before shooting, according to Acevedo. Previous guest actors Orla Brady, Lily Pilblad, Ari Graynor, Omar Metwally, Ryan McDonald, and David Call appear in the finale, as well as new guest stars Philip Winchester and Pascale Hutton.|$|E
60|$|Tony's {{excitement}} was great, but {{the effect}} of his late training {{was seen in the}} suppression of all feeling, save that which escaped through the eyes. Paint and charcoal concealed the flush <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> effectually.|$|R
60|$|The lawyer made no reply. As Cuthbert {{spoke the}} ruddy color <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> had been {{replaced}} by a ghastly pallor. An expression of bewilderment had come across his face, the perspiration stood out in big drops <b>on</b> <b>his</b> forehead.|$|R
60|$|Billy Towler {{pursed his}} little red lips as {{he nodded his}} small head and winked one of his large blue eyes. A slight {{deepening}} of the red <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> told eloquently enough that he did understand that.|$|R
2500|$|He {{opens this}} essay with a painterly image of Southey as an {{embodiment}} of self-contradiction: [...] "We formerly remember {{to have seen}} him [...] a hectic flush <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> [...] a smile betwixt hope and sadness that still played upon his quivering lip." [...] Hazlitt continues: ...|$|E
2500|$|Rahman got a {{relatively}} late {{start in the}} sport. [...] He was an enforcer for drug dealers, and was known for surviving several shootings. [...] He nearly {{died in a car}} accident (which left him with permanent scarring <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> and ear) and once survived a shooting where five bullets entered his body. [...] He took up boxing at age 20 and had just 10 amateur bouts before making his pro debut on December 3, 1994, at age 22. He is a devout Muslim.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, during {{negotiations}} {{regarding the}} release of The Gold Experience, a legal battle ensued between Warner Bros. and Prince over the artistic and financial control of his musical output. During the lawsuit, Prince appeared in public with the word [...] "slave" [...] written <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek.</b> He explained that he had {{changed his name to}} an unpronounceable symbol to emancipate himself from his contract with Warner Bros., and that he had done it out of frustration because he felt his own name now belonged to the company.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your Charlotte is Fisher's wife, you know, and {{a worthy}} good {{creature}} she is. Poor old Fisher, {{the first time}} I saw tears <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> was when <b>his</b> wife met him being carried up, and I took her to him.|$|R

60|$|Julian {{rose from}} the place that he had occupied.

2500|$|Rally is a {{young boy}} who idolizes his friend Yusei. He steals a chip to assist Yusei in his duel against Jack. In return, Yusei helps him out when Rally is {{targeted}} by Security because of the marker <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek.</b> While Rally's main deck is never seen, his specialty is 'One Shot' monsters. [...] Rally gave one of his monsters, Turbo Booster, to Yusei for good luck. During Yusei's duel with Roman, Roman uses Rally as a human shield. Rally uses One Shot Cannon to destroy the Earthbound Immortal Uru, thereby sacrificing himself to save Yusei. Rally returns when Yusei defeats Roman.|$|E
2500|$|At Manifest, Ivașcu {{spoke out}} against the Iron Guard, a {{homegrown}} fascist movement—but, according to Iorga, did so in a [...] "disjointed" [...] manner. Much later in life, Ivașcu told his friends that the murder of Premier Ion G. Duca by a Guardist death squad had greatly shocked him. He was involved in several street battles and, in 1936, when he helped Iordan break through an Iron Guard barrage, received a rather deep cut <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> from shattered glass. He was also dragged in academic confrontations between {{the left and the}} right: the latter denied his application for Iorga's Romanian School in Fontenay-aux-Roses.|$|E
2500|$|Schmid was a {{short man}} who wore cowboy boots stuffed with {{newspapers}} and flattened cans to make him appear taller. [...] He used lip balm, pancake makeup and created an artificial mole <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek.</b> [...] He also stretched his lower lip with a clothespin to make it resemble Elvis Presley's. He was called the [...] "Pied Piper" [...] because he was charismatic and had many friends in the teenage community of Tucson. [...] Women liked him and he frequently met them at the Speedway area of Tucson. [...] For a time, {{the members of his}} teenage coterie would keep the secrets of his murders.|$|E
60|$|Scaramouche {{pulled the}} bell-rope, {{not at all}} discomposed. He smiled. There was a flush <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> and a gleam in his eyes. He was {{very pleased with the}} world that night. He really owed a great debt to M. de Lesdiguieres.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{of course}} I don't mean cryin' {{out like a}} baby," [...] said Hetty, looking down with a modest smile, [...] "but I saw tears in his eyes, and {{sometimes}} they got <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks.</b> I can't think what's the matter with him." ...|$|R
