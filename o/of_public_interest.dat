The Pelourinho de Santa Catarina (pillory of Saint Catherine) in the civil parish of Santa Catarina, constructed in the 16th century, was declared a property <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in 1933. Capela de São Jacinto (Chapel of Saint Hyacinth), located in Casais de São Jacinto in the civil parish of Coto, was originally built in the 16th century and reconstructed in baroque style in the 18th century.

5|$|On 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in Viborg {{discontinued}} {{the investigation}} as {{he found no}} basis for concluding that the cartoons constituted a criminal offence because the publication concerned a subject <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> and Danish case law extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest.</b> He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech {{must be taken into}} consideration, and said that freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation. In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.|$|E

5|$|Upholding {{the concept}} of {{representative}} democracy requires the protection of freedom of expression. This paves the way for discussion {{of the state of}} affairs in the country, as expressed by representatives of the people, which include members of the ruling party elected into government as well as opposition politicians. Free discourse about political ideas and government plans can facilitate the acknowledgement of current weaknesses or limitations. This is justified in the name <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> as the legislature, administration and governmental institutions will then strive to make improvements.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Dan Brown's best-selling 2003 {{conspiracy}} fiction novel The Da Vinci Code and the subsequent 2006 film, {{there was a new}} level <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in the Priory of Sion. Brown's novel promotes the mythical version of the Priory but departs from the ultimate conclusions presented in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. Rather than plotting to create a Federal Europe ruled by a Merovingian sacred king descended from the historical Jesus, the Priory of Sion initiates its members into a mystery cult seeking to restore the feminist theology necessary for a complete understanding of early Christianity, which was supposedly suppressed by the Roman Catholic Church. The author has presented this speculation as fact in his non-fiction preface, as well as in his public appearances and interviews.|$|E

40|$|The {{accounting}} profession, {{like all}} professions, has {{a commitment to}} advance {{the interests of the}} general community, as well as those they are contractually bound to serve. Providing services altruistically, at times without compensation, is a salient feature <b>of</b> the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> ideal. A review of the literature indicates that the profession has abandoned its <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> role so that serving self-interest now appears to have primacy (Bédard 2001; Canning and O 2 ̆ 7 Dwyer 2001; Parker 1994; Saravanamuthu 2004). The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine members 2 ̆ 7 interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> ideal and to elicit their perceptions on issues arising from the literature. The results of a survey to members of CPA Australia indicate that members can iterate the formal definition <b>of</b> the <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> but their application <b>of</b> the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in conflict <b>of</b> interest situations is inconsistent with this definition...|$|R
5|$|Blue whale strandings are {{extremely}} uncommon, and, {{because of the}} species' social structure, mass strandings are unheard of. When strandings do occur, they can become the focus <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest.</b> In 1920, a blue whale washed up near Bragar on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. It had been shot by whalers, but the harpoon had failed to explode. As with other mammals, the fundamental instinct of the whale {{was to try to}} carry on breathing at all costs, even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning. Two of the whale's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|Florida State earned its bid to the ACC Championship game by {{fighting}} through an Atlantic Division schedule that included several nationally ranked teams.

Additional losses to North Carolina State and Clemson {{at the end of}} the season almost eliminated the Seminoles from contention for a spot in the championship game, but losses by Clemson and the other Atlantic Division leaders gave the Seminoles a second chance and set up an ACC Championship game between Florida State and Virginia Tech. The two teams had previously played in the 2000 National Championship Game, and the rematch served as a point <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Parties {{bringing}} {{judicial review}} must have sufficient {{interest in the}} challenged subject. Professor Mullen therefore {{suggests that it is}} at first glance surprising that standing was not contested: the appellants brought proceedings in their personal capacities, yet had not even been threatened with prosecution. However, he suggests that no challenge was made because the legislation was likely to be challenged at some point and it was more convenient for the Government to have the legal issue decided before the Hunting Act came into force. Moreover, the recent expansion of standing for issues <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> such as the validity of an Act of Parliament, would have made a successful challenge more difficult.|$|E

5|$|Praça da República (Republic Square) is {{a public}} square in the centre of town. The plaza, popularly known as Praça da Fruta (Fruit Square), hosts Portugal's only daily outdoor farmers' market. The square is {{surrounded}} by buildings, most containing shops, banks, and cafés on the ground floor. Built 1747–1750 on the northern side of the square, the baroque former city hall (paços do concelho), now used by the junta de freguesia (civil parish council) of the União das Freguesias de Caldas da Rainha — Nossa Senhora do Pópulo, Coto e São Gregório, was declared a property <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in 1984. Praça 5 de Outubro (5 October Square), also known as Antiga Praça do Peixe (Old Fish Square), formerly hosted the city's open-air fish market, which has since moved to an indoor location (Mercado do Peixe). The plaza is now used for outdoor café seating and free cultural events. A statue of Queen Leonor {{stands in the middle}} of the roundabout at Largo Conde de Fontalva (Count of Fontalva Square), popularly called Largo da Rainha (Queen's Square).|$|E

5|$|The Fundamental Rights are not {{absolute}} and {{are subject to}} reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest.</b> In the Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala case in 1973, the Supreme Court, overruling a previous decision of 1967, held that the Fundamental Rights could be amended, subject to judicial review in case such an amendment violated {{the basic structure of}} the Constitution. The Fundamental Rights can be enhanced, removed or otherwise altered through a constitutional amendment, passed by a two-thirds majority of each House of Parliament. The imposition of a state of emergency may lead to a temporary suspension any of the Fundamental Rights, excluding Articles 20 and 21, by order of the President. The President may, by order, suspend the right to constitutional remedies as well, thereby barring citizens from approaching the Supreme Court for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights, except Articles 20 and 21, during the period of the emergency. Parliament may also restrict the application of the Fundamental Rights to members of the Indian Armed Forces and the police, in order to ensure proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline, by a law made under Article 33.|$|E
5|$|The {{coronation}} of GeorgeVI in 1937 {{was broadcast}} on radio by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), {{and parts of}} the service were filmed and shown in cinemas. The state procession was shown live on the new BBC Television Service, the first major outside broadcast. At ElizabethII's coronation in 1953, most of the proceedings inside the abbey were also televised by the BBC. Originally, events as far as the choir screen were to be televised live, with the remainder to be filmed and released later after any mishaps were edited out. This would prevent television viewers from seeing most of the highlights of the coronation, including the actual crowning, live; it led to controversy in the press and even questions in parliament. The organising committee subsequently decided that the entire ceremony would be televised, except for the anointing and communion, which had also been excluded from photography at the last coronation. It was revealed 30 years later that the about-face was due to the personal intervention of the queen. It is estimated that over 20million people watched the broadcast in the United Kingdom. The coronation contributed to the increase <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in television, which rose significantly.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to legal}} {{uncertainty}} surrounding {{the application of}} key provisions of European and UK data protection law, the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in protecting individuals’ informational privacy is routinely neglected, as are the <b>public</b> <b>interests</b> in certain uses of data. Consent or anonymisation are often treated as the paradigmatic example of compliance with data protection law, even though both are unable {{to attend to the}} full range of rights and interests at stake in data processing. Currently, where data processing may serve a realisable <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> and consent or anonymisation are impracticable (if not impossible to obtain) the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> conditions to processing are the rational alternative justifications for processing. However, the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> conditions are poorly defined in the legislation, and misunderstood and neglected in practice. This thesis offers a much-needed alternative to the predominant consent-or-anonymise paradigm by providing a new understanding <b>of</b> the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> concept in data protection law and to suggest a new approach to deploying the concept {{in a way that is}} consistent with the protective and facilitative aims of the legislation. Through undertaking legislative analysis new insight is provided on the purpose <b>of</b> the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> conditions in data protection law, revealing critical gaps in understanding. By engaging with <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> theory and discovering the conceptual contours <b>of</b> the <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> these gaps are addressed. Combined with the insight obtained from the legislative history, we can determine the reasonable range of circumstances and types of processing where it may be justifiable to use personal data based on the <b>public</b> <b>interest.</b> On this basis, and to develop a new approach for deploying the concept, other legal uses <b>of</b> the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> are examined. The lessons learned suggest legislative and procedural elements that are critical to successful deployment <b>of</b> the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> concept in data protection. The thesis concludes with the identification of key components to allow a clearer understanding <b>of</b> the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in this field. Further, these insights enable recommendations to be made, to reform the law, procedure and guidance. In doing so, the concept <b>of</b> the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> can be confidently deployed in line with the aims of data protection law, to both protect and facilitate the use of personal data...|$|R
