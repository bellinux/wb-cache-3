40|$|Thermosetting polymer {{materials}} are widely utilised in modern microelectronics packaging technology. These materials {{are used for}} a number of functions, such as for device bonding, for structural support applications and for physical protection of semiconductor dies. Typically, convection heating systems are used to raise the temperature of the materials to expedite the polymerisation process. The convection cure process has a number of drawbacks including process durations generally in excess of 1 hour and the requirement to heat the entire printed circuit board assembly, inducing thermomechanical stresses which effect device reliability. Microwave energy is able to raise the temperature of materials in a rapid, controlled manner. As the microwave energy penetrates into the {{polymer materials}}, the heating can be considered volumetric – i. e. the rate of heating is approximately constant throughout the material. This enables a maximal heating rate far greater than is available with convection oven systems which only raise the surface temperature of the polymer material and rely on thermal conductivity to transfer heat energy into the bulk. The high heating rate, combined with the ability to vary the operating power of the microwave system, enables the extremely rapid cure processes. Microwave curing of a commercially available encapsulation material has been studied experimentally and through use of numerical modelling techniques. The material assessed is Henkel EO- 1080, a single component thermosetting epoxy. The producer has suggested three typical convection <b>oven</b> <b>cure</b> options for EO 1080 : 20 min at 150 C or 90 min at 140 C or 120 min at 110 C. Rapid curing of materials of this type using advanced microwave systems, such as the FAMOBS system [1], is of great interest to microelectronics system manufacturers as {{it has the potential to}} reduce manufacturing costs, increase device reliability and enables new device designs. Experimental analysis has demonstrated that, in a realistic chip-on-board encapsulation scenario, the polymer material can be fully cured in approximately one minute. This corresponds to a reduction in cure time of approximately 95 percent relative to the convection oven process. Numerical assessment of the process [2] also suggests that cure times of approximately 70 seconds are feasible whilst indicating that the decrease in process duration comes at the expense of variation in degree of cure within the polymer...|$|E

Two different sources of class C fly ash, with different chemical compositions {{were used to}} prepare alkali-activated mortar mixtures. Four different sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide (SS/SH) ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 5 were used as alkaline activators with a constant sodium hydroxide concentration of 10  M. Two curing regimes were also applied, <b>oven</b> <b>curing</b> at 70  °C for 24  h, and ambient curing at 23  ±  2  °C.

40|$|AbstractA hybrid {{stereolithography}} (SL) /direct print (DP) {{system has}} been developed and previously described that fabricates three-dimensional (3 D) structural electronic devices in which component placement, interconnect routing, and system boundaries are not confined to two dimensions {{as is the case}} with traditional printed circuit boards (PCBs). The resulting increased level of design and fabrication freedom provides potential for a reduction in both volume and weight as well as the capability of fabricating systems in arbitrary and complex shapes as required to conform to unique application requirements (e. g., human anatomy, airframe structures, and other volumetrically-constrained mechanical systems). The fabrication of these devices without intermediate part removal between SL and DP processes requires in situ curing of DP-dispensed silver-based inks to sufficiently cure the inks prior to continuing additional SL fabrication. This paper describes investigations into the laser curing process using the two laser wavelengths, 355 nm and 325 nm, which have been used in commercial SL machines. Various laser curing parameters, including energy (laser power and scan speed), scanning location, and laser wavelength were investigated. The trace resistances and structural changes in the SL substrate and printed trace were compared for each experiment to determine the most preferred laser ink curing method. Furthermore, oven curing of partially laser cured ink traces was investigated as a means for minimizing the number of in situ laser passes required to embed ink traces during SL fabrication. The laser curing process was repeated for a wide variety of conductive inks, having different structure, composition, and curing properties to determine if certain inks were more responsive to laser curing and if the ink curing results could be generalized. A statistical study was conducted under the hypothesis that laser curing of inks at 325 nm wavelength would be better, due to lower silver reflectance, as compared to 355 nm wavelength. Results indicated that particulate silver based conductive inks can be successfully cured in situ using SL lasers with various laser curing parameters. Curing ink traces at high laser power and slow scan speeds with the laser beam located on the substrate adjacent to the ink channel resulted in the most effective ink curing but resulted in discoloration of the ink and/or charring of the SL substrate. Comparatively, when laser power was reduced sufficiently to eliminate the charring, lower effective ink curing was achieved. Irradiating the laser directly on the ink did not damage the ink or the substrate, while providing low trace resistances, and represents the most viable laser curing alternative to achieve acceptable trace resistance without charring the SL substrate. The results further indicated that partial laser curing of ink using a reduced number of laser passes with subsequent <b>oven</b> <b>cure</b> seem to work effectively and may decrease overall manufacturing time. SL lasers with low power (< 100 mW) may not be effective for curing conductive inks that have high viscosities and require high curing temperatures.

A microwave curing regime based on a control strategy using temperature feedback data was developed and evaluated in the manufacture of AAFA. The temperature profile within the AAFA sample produced under microwave curing was obtained by using an embedded optical fibre temperature sensor, which was thus used to adjust the microwave power in real-time in order to achieve a desired internal temperature.

40|$|Abstract]: To process composites, {{post-curing}} {{with heat}} is often required {{in order to}} achieve the desired heat distortion temperature (HDT). Post-curing the composites with conventional oven would often take 6 or 8 hours. However, if the composites are post-cured in a microwave oven, it only requires a few minutes. Hence, the aim of the project is to investigate the suitability of microwave for material processing. Epoxies are polyethers and they are widely used to produce coatings, structural adhesives because they have excellent adhesion and low cure shrinkage. Epoxies are also good dielectric and have been used to manufacture printed circuit boards (PCB). The main objectives of this project are: • To produce specimens with different percentage by weight of sawdust. • To measure the loss tangent and dielectric constant of the specimens. • To measure the tensile strength of the specimens. • To measure the glass transition temperature of the specimens • To consider both of the material costs and the test results to recommend the best specimens for different industrial applications. This report has found that the sawdust reinforced epoxy resins have higher Young’s modulus, higher dielectric constant but lower tensile strength and yield strength. The loss tangents of the sawdust reinforced epoxy resins were slightly higher than the loss tangents of pour epoxy resins. Hence, the sawdust reinforced epoxy resin is slightly more efficient to be post-cured in microwave than pure epoxy resin. This report has also found that <b>oven</b> <b>cured</b> epoxy resins have the lowest dielectric constant, the lowest loss tangent, and the highest glass transition temperature.
