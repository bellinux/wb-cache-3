40|$|Abstract: The {{impact of}} global {{slowdown}} and busted Internet ventures {{may have led}} to a rationalized view <b>of</b> the role <b>IT</b> play in businesses. But that has not stopped global 2000 businesses from investing for collaborating with partners and customers. IT has drastically reduced cost of collaboration in the last 20 years. One consequent change in the business environment is the delineation in emphasis on point-to-point transaction-based relationships towards dynamically managed many-to-many collaborative relationships. This is paving the way for the genesis of a dynamic, globally collaborative business environment which in our view, will be driven by IT. Executing global collaboration, from an enterprise standpoint, would pose a serious technological challenge. Even though true global collaboration will be the result of a right mix of organizational, social, legal, cultural and political influences, the role <b>of</b> <b>IT</b> will be significant in managing such collaboration. This paper looks at the changing roles information technology play in shaping the future of collaboration in the context <b>of</b> enterprise businesses. <b>It</b> also tries to establish that IT is about human-machine relationships and concludes that collaboration is the most basic benefit <b>of</b> introducing <b>IT</b> to enterprises. While doing so, we would attempt to define the evolving technology waves shaping the enterprises of the future, given the other dependencies. We would also attempt to define for the first time, in our opinion, what the next generation <b>of</b> <b>IT</b> driven enterprises <b>would</b> <b>look</b> like. In the process, we arrive at a means <b>of</b> measuring <b>IT</b> dependence <b>of</b> an organization. 1...|$|R

Within a 5-month shooting schedule, 3 weeks were spent shooting at studio locations. Production designer Jack Collis, explained how the film integrates a minority group (the aliens) into the film saying, [...] "The idea was to bring in this alien group, assimilate them into our society, and get them a locale that would be a part <b>of</b> Los Angeles, ... <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> almost as if a group of Koreans or Vietnamese that had moved into the area. This group would have established their own community. They have their own language, their own signs." [...] The film crew installed fictional alien language signs along Western Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard. Colored drawings were made of all stores {{on both sides of the}} street for two full blocks. Painted and electrical signs were designed for each building. Graffiti was also carefully planned out. The film crew did their own painting and even took a big blank concrete wall and inserted alien graffiti for a scene involving an early physical confrontation between the main characters. Essentially, the alphabet of the alien citizens had to be designed as an integral part of their environment. He commented how the crew [...] "came up with individual alphabets and then combined them into certain words like, say, 'enter' and 'open', so that we could repeat them, ..." [...] while also mentioning how they [...] "brought in a language expert to give us something the actors could be comfortable with." [...] The Hawthorns, a well known family of sign painters, created most of the alien signs. Collis even mused how at one point, store owners liked, and wouldn't want to take down the alien graffiti used during filming on their properties. Collis recalled how the alien language resembled [...] "a flowing design more like hand writing than lettering, that looks almost like a heartbeat graph. Occasionally, we'd underline it as though it came from sort of electronic machine, like an IBM report. It turned out to be such a simple thing once we got it going, but we had to go through a process of 'what is this going to look like?' before we got what we wanted." ...|$|R
