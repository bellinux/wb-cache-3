5|$|The GWR <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> the {{reduction}} of the Bakerloo Tube's Paddington connection to a shuttle and the MR <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> the connection of the two lines, which would be in competition with its line through Kilburn. Parliament rejected the proposed connection and the changes to the NWLR's route and the company's permissions eventually expired without any construction work being carried out. The Bakerloo Tube bill was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|By 1966 the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Synod forbade {{membership}} in the Loyal Order of Moose.

5|$|Opposition to {{the project}} was based on three {{separate}} objections to its construction: ecological, human, and financial. Conservation groups opposed the dam's construction because it would flood the Yukon Flats, a large wetland area that provides breeding ground for millions of waterfowl and habitat for game and fur-bearing animals. Alaska Native groups <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> the project's human cost—the need to relocate more than 1,500 people and 9 villages—and Native groups outside the reservoir area <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> the potential devastation of the Yukon River salmon population. The third objection to construction of the dam stemmed from its high cost {{and the belief that}} cheap electricity would not be enough to attract industry to Alaska.|$|E

50|$|A {{taxpayer}} <b>objects</b> <b>to</b> {{a decision}} and this is first reviewed by {{an officer of the}} Australian Taxation Office. The objection is either allowed, in which case the taxpayer has generally won, or it is disallowed, in which case the taxpayer can <b>object</b> <b>to</b> the disallowance. If the taxpayer <b>objects</b> <b>to</b> a disallowance, the same process takes place but with a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal instead of a taxation officer. Following a disallowance at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the taxpayer can then <b>object</b> <b>to</b> the Federal Court of Australia.|$|R
40|$|Some trades {{based on}} {{differences}} in beliefs might cause {{more harm than}} good. Should they be restricted? If yes, how? We propose three properties ensuring that regulation does not prevent beneficial trade and is consistent: Unanimity – the regulator should not <b>object</b> <b>to</b> trades with identical beliefs; Merge-Proofness of Autarky – if the regulator does not <b>object</b> <b>to</b> finitely many unrelated trades, all with identical beliefs, then it should not <b>object</b> <b>to</b> the mere juxtaposition of the trades; and Independence of Irrelevant Trade – if the regulator does not <b>object</b> <b>to</b> the juxtaposition of two unrelated trades, then it should not <b>object</b> <b>to</b> any of the two trades standing alone.
