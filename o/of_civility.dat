5|$|Charles Buller Heberden became {{principal}} in 1889. He saw sporting {{as a means}} to the institution <b>of</b> <b>civility</b> than an end in itself; together with Richard Lodge, it was this spirit that dominated his tenure as principal. Academic rigour was reintroduced to the college, and the staff of Brasenose were increasingly successful in maintaining discipline. Until the end of the century, however, the number of students achieving blues outnumbered those attaining firsts. Author John Buchan joined in 1895, a man of this new era– although his work continued to portray Brasenose as its previous muscular stereotype. Heberden was also the first lay principal, although he was personally committed to the church– purchasing an organ for the chapel out of his own personal funds. Brasenose was frequently represented as boasting no academic prowess at all. Three of the ten fellows were set aside for non-classicists; a Junior Common Room (JCR) was created in 1887; in 1897 the library was opened up to undergraduates; in 1899, Fellows were granted a right to sabbatical leave. The fellows themselves were increasingly secular; only four of fourteen fellows were clergy.|$|E

Rum as well as brandy and other distilled beverages had become important trade items and essential elements in diplomatic councils, treaty negotiations, and political transactions and had become part of Native American gift-giving rituals. The result was the erosion <b>of</b> <b>civility,</b> an increase in violence and widespread health problems. Alcohol made men less reliable hunters and allies, destabilized village economics and contributed to a rise in poverty.|$|E

25|$|The media enables {{concerned}} citizens {{to pick up}} images of criminal events— the perpetrators, the victims, motives, and sensational details of violent crimes; interpersonal communication and internet based social networks add to the dissemination of information. Fear may be generated if the individual identifies with the described victim, or feels that their own neighbourhood bears resemblance to the one described; then the image of risk may be taken up, personalised and translated into personal safety concerns. The media sometimes reports fear of crime through broader concerns about neighbourhood breakdown, the loss of moral authority, and the crumbling <b>of</b> <b>civility</b> and social capital.|$|E

Allen Metz wrote in the book, The Madonna Companion, that the lyrics did not give an impression of [...] "sophisticated wordplay", but was commendable for telling the truth about Madonna's life and career. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic labelled the song as a [...] "swirling" [...] and [...] "meditative opener". David Browne from Entertainment Weekly described the track, along with [...] "Frozen" [...] from the album, as [...] "breathtaking", complimenting its beats. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine found Madonna's belting to be the most [...] "emotionally candid" [...] she has been since her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer (1989).|$|E

With Sarah, her unfaithfulness {{is just one of}} the symptoms of the fact that she's torn and is going to have to make this strong moral choice." [...] Sarah's storyline also explores her moral culpability following Andrew's suicide. Personal accountability is a central theme of the novel, with Elkins of The New York Times opining that by not focusing on [...] "postcolonial guilt or African angst", Cleave is able to use the novel to challenge readers' conceptions <b>of</b> <b>civility</b> and ethical choice. Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle similarly feels that the book delivered a message of anti-complacency, however believes that is does so by [...] "bemoaning the normality of the First World in the face of the horrors of the Third." [...] She deemed The Other Hand essentially a novel about [...] "the borders we draw, and the real damage they inflict".|$|E

Many called repeatedly; one banker made 20visits, paying the admission fee on each occasion. During this period of English history no real stigma was attached to obesity, and Lambert was generally considered a wonder to be marvelled at, rather than a freak to be gawped or sneered at. His business venture was immediately successful, drawing around 400paying visitors per day. His home was described as having {{the air of a}} fashionable resort, rather than that of an exhibition, and he was pleased to find that his customers generally treated him with courtesy, and not simply as a spectacle. He insisted on maintaining amongst his visitors an atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>civility</b> and all men entering his rooms were obliged to remove their hats. One visitor refused to remove his [...] "even if the King were present" [...] but Lambert replied that [...] "Then by G——, Sir, you must instantly quit this room, as I do not consider it a mark of respect due to myself, but to the ladies and gentlemen who honor me with their company." ...|$|E

As Jane Howell, director of the BBC Shakespeare adaptation argues, [...] "what I was concerned about in the first play [...] was {{that for a long}} time, the code of the people had been chivalry. But with the death of Talbot, one starts to see a demise of chivalry." [...] Narcissistic political infighting has supplanted self-sacrificing patriotism and chivalry: [...] "the play charts the disastrous breakdown <b>of</b> <b>civility</b> among the English nobility." [...] Nobles concerned with personal power above all else have replaced knights concerned only with the empire. As such, {{by the end of the}} play, both Talbot and his son lay dead, as does the notion of English chivalry.

2500|$|In France, {{the period}} {{following}} the Wars of Religion saw {{the appearance of}} a new form of narrative fiction (which some critics have termed the [...] "sentimental novel"), which quickly became a literary sensation thanks to the enthusiasm of a reading public searching for entertainment after so many years of conflict. These short (and realistic) novels of love (or amours, as they are frequently called in the titles) included extensive examples of gallant letters and polite discourse, amorous dialogues, letters and poems inserted in the story, gallant conceits and other rhetorical figures. [...] These texts {{played an important role in}} the elaboration of new modes <b>of</b> <b>civility</b> and discourse of the upper classes (leading to the notion of the noble honnête homme). [...] None of these novels have been republished since the early 17th century, and they remain largely unknown today. [...] Authors associated with les Amours were Antoine de Nervèze, Nicolas des Escuteaux and François du Souhait. Meanwhile, the tradition of the dark tale—coming from the tragic short story (histoire tragique) associated with Bandello, and frequently ending in suicide or murder—continued in the works of Jean-Pierre Camus and François de Rosset.|$|E
