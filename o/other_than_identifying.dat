In many cases, the models are complex and the parameters unintuitive for non-experts. In this paper, we present an optimization method for setting parameters of a procedural fluid animation system by showing the user examples of different parametrized animations and asking for feedback. Our method employs the Bayesian technique of bringing in “prior ” belief based on previous runs of the system and/or expert knowledge, to assist users in finding good parameter settings in as few steps as possible. To do this, we introduce novel extensions to Bayesian optimization, which permit effective learning for parameter-based procedural animation applications. We show that even when users {{are trying to find}} a variety of different target animations, the system can learn and improve. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to related active learning methods.

30|$|Since {{amino acids}} can be {{produced}} both biologically and non-biologically, the most fundamental task that is common {{to the study of}} meteoritic amino acids is to identify the amino acids that are indigenous to the meteorite, which were produced or obtained through processes prior to atmospheric entry, and to distinguish them from terrestrial contaminants. The Itokawa particles returned by the first Hayabusa mission, for example, were shown to be composed of proteic amino acids at blank levels only (Naraoka et al. 2012). Their results were supported by several other preliminary analyses of the Itokawa particles (e.g., Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy) (Kitajima et al. 2015; Uesugi et al. 2014; Yabuta et al. 2014), which suggested that although organic materials were present, it was difficult to ascertain their extraterrestrial origin. <b>Other</b> <b>than</b> <b>identifying</b> amino acids that have rare biological occurrence and determining the relative amino acid abundances and enantiomeric ratio, stable isotope ratio is a reliable and convenient tool used to tell apart terrestrial and extraterrestrial amino acids, as biology preferentially uses lighter isotopes, while amino acids formed by abiotic processes in cold environments are more enriched in heavier isotopes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{a recent}} series of articles, Hislope (1998, 2000) and Harvey (2000 a, 2000 b) have raised {{questions}} about the usefulness of “evolutionary theory ” especially for any purpose <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>identifying</b> “distal ” causes of ethnic phenomena. This article responds to those views and argues that evolutionary psychology shows great promise in contributing to the explanation of contemporary ethnic identities and ethnic conflict. The authors argue that an evolutionary psychology approach embraces research conducted through conventional social science approaches, helps to complete explanations of the proximate causes of ethnic conflict, and can recast thought and encourage new areas of research about important issues in the ethnic conflict field. Illustrations are provided in support of each of these points. Some of these arguments have been heard before with respect to the general role of evolutionary theory in explaining social phenomena but they are arguments we think bear repeating and illustrating {{in the context of the}} study of ethnic phenomena. Before examining the ways that evolutionary psychology can contribute to social science explanation of ethnic phenomena, we summarize the general evolutionary psychology approach to the study of social behavior...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} all {{models of the}} thalamo-cortical system that satisfy the following two assumptions: (1) each cortical column is an autonomous oscillator; (2) connections between cortical columns and the thalamus are weak. Our goal is to deduce from these assumptions general principles of thalamo-cortical interactions that are independent of the equations describing the system. We find {{that the existence of}} synaptic connections between any two cortical columns does not guarantee that the columns interact: They interact only when there is a certain nearly resonant relation between their frequencies, which implies that the interactions are frequency modulated (FM). When the resonance relation holds, the cortical columns interact through phase modulations. Thus, communications between weakly connected cortical oscillators employ a principle similar to that in FM radio: The frequency of oscillation encodes the channel of communication, while the information is transmitted via phase modulations. If the thalamic input has an appropriate frequency, then it can dynamically link any two cortical columns, even those that have non-resonant frequencies and would otherwise be unlinked. Thus, by adjusting its temporal activity, the thalamus has control over information processing taking place in the cortex. Our results suggest that the mean firing rate (frequency) of periodically spiking neuron does not carry any information <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>identifying</b> a channel of communication.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} work to develop design guidance to incorporate the influence of building stiffness in modifying the deflection ratios and horizontal strains induced by deep excavations. Using the finite element method, a multi-proposed excavation was simulated adjacent to a building, which was modelled first as an elastic beam {{and then as a}} frame structure. Parametric studies were conducted where the structural stiffness and geometry of the building were varied and the characteristics of the excavation changed. As a result of the rigorous study, new definitions of relative building stiffness have been proposed and design guidance to estimate the building modification factors are developed from which the building deflection ratios and horizontal strains may be estimated from the Greenfield condition. Furthermore, using structural analysis, methods to include the influence of frame action were also developed for framed buildings on continuous footings and on individual footings. Two new case studies were formulated and analysed in the dissertation – the response of the Singapore Art Museum under the influence of movements induced by adjacent deep excavations, and the response of the Pasir Panjang shop houses under the influence of movements induced by bored tunnelling for the new Singapore Circle Line. <b>Other</b> <b>than</b> <b>identifying</b> some important behaviour of building response to tunnelling- and excavation-induced movements, these case studies – together with previously complete case histories – were also used to validate the findings from the numerical study.

40|$|Realism {{approach}} {{has dominated the}} studies of world politics and international relations since {{the last of the}} World War II and until the start of the Cold War era. The focus {{of this study is to}} look into the factors that ignited the war <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>identifying</b> the policies or actions taken by the countries involved in the war. The question that arises lies in the extent to which the approach is able to explain the factors and actions taken by the leaders, to the point that it led to the 1967 war, and how this war can serve as guidance for our understanding of the Realism Theory. The objective of this study is to unravel the chains of events that had become the background of the 1967 Arab-Israeli War by concentrating on the root causes of the war and the policies of the countries involved, other than offering justification for the Realism Theory by looking closely into the characteristics, assumptions, and concepts under this approach. The methodology of this work employs document analysis and historical studies to obtain complete data. The analysis was carried out by applying the Arab-Israeli war events to the Realism Theory to prove that there is an association between the causes of the war and the theory through the analysis unit, key assumptions and substantial concepts contained in the Realism approach. The unit of analysis, which places the countries as the main actor in the international system, can be seen through the main role of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Israel throughout the period of war. Concepts such as power, power balance, national interests, national sovereignty and self-help are also associated with the causes behind this war through a series of facts that have manifested themselves in the even...|$|E
