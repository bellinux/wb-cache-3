500|$|Before leaving, Han Solo {{runs into}} Princess Leia, who insists on Han staying with her. Apologizing to Leia for {{having to leave}} her, Han gives her his e-mail address, which is hosted by the nearly defunct company CompuServe at [...] "hansolo64@compuserve.com." [...] Han Solo then {{questions}} why Leia wants him to stay, and suggests that she is afraid that she will not get a [...] "goodbye kiss" [...] before he leaves. Leia then mulls over the thought, and tells him that she would rather kiss Star Trek actor George Takei. Abruptly entering, C-3PO and R2-D2 alert Han Solo of Luke Skywalker's disappearance. Han goes out to look for Luke on his [...] "Dondon", which has {{the body of a}} tauntaun, {{and the head of the}} late actor Don Knotts. Once Han locates Luke, the late comedian Rodney Dangerfield appears, to which Han responds, [...] "There are way too many elderly comedians <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> snow." [...] Before being rescued, Han first appears in a 1980s commercial for the chewing gum Juicy Fruit, with the original audio from the commercial and Juicy Fruit's current logo. The sequence was originally planned for the fifth season episode [...] "Road to Rupert", with Stewie and Brian taking the place of Peter.|$|E
2500|$|Hope {{started by}} saying [...] "Why, Groucho Marx! (applause) Groucho, {{what are you}} doing <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desert?" [...] Groucho retorted, [...] "Huh, desert, I've been sitting in the {{dressing}} room for forty minutes! Some desert alright..." [...] Groucho continued to ignore the script, and although Hope was a formidable ad-libber in his own right, he could not begin to keep up with Groucho, who lengthened the scene well beyond its allotted time slot with a veritable onslaught of improvised wisecracks.|$|E
2500|$|George Miller cites as {{an initial}} {{inspiration}} for the film an encounter with a grizzled old cameraman, whose father was Frank Hurley of the Shackleton expeditions, during the shooting of Mad Max 2: [...] "We were sitting in this bar, having a milkshake, and he looked across at me and said, ‘Antarctica.’ He’d shot a documentary there. He said, ‘You’ve {{got to make a}} film in Antarctica. It’s just like <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wasteland. It’s spectacular.’ And that always stuck in my head.” ...|$|E

The restless city of pleasure settles to its short sleep.|$|R
2500|$|The imprint {{will not}} publish books written by Riordan, [...] "whose role will {{be closer to}} curator". In an {{interview}} with the Iowa Gazette, Riordan said, [...] "instead of me writing all of the mythologies we are going to look for authors who already are writing about that stuff. If I feel like I can recommend them ... we’re going to have them <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spotlight." [...] A focus will be placed on [...] "diverse, mythology-based fiction by new, emerging, and under-represented authors". Lurie expressed hopes that the imprint will help satisfy Riordan fans, without asking the author to write more than his usual two books a year.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the tour}} Ranji and Stoddart had made disparaging {{comments}} about Australian crowds in the Australian press, which ensured the matches were played amongst great rancour. Stoddart wrote, [...] "I shall, in all probability, never visit this country {{again with a}} cricket team, and what I have said has been purely {{for the good of}} the game, for the sake of the players in this country, and of English teams coming <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future." [...] Stoddart never did tour Australia again, although at the tour's end Ranji did send an apology, and his popularity did not suffer so much as a result.|$|E
