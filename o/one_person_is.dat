5|$|Kant's Formula of Autonomy {{expresses the}} idea that an agent is obliged to follow the Categorical Imperative because of their {{rational}} will, rather than any outside influence. Kant believed that any moral law motivated {{by the desire to}} fulfill some other interest would deny the Categorical Imperative, leading him to argue that the moral law must only arise from a rational will. This principle requires people to recognize the right of others to act autonomously and means that, as moral laws must be universalisable, what is required of <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> required of all.|$|E
5|$|September 14, 1944 — The 1944 Great Atlantic {{hurricane}} makes landfall on Long Island as a category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale {{at a high}} {{forward speed}} of 40mph (64km/h). Wind gusts of well over 100mph (160km/h) breaks previous wind records in New York City, while a minimum pressure reading of 28.47inches is recorded on Long Island. 117homes are completely destroyed, while 2,427are severely damaged and almost 1000businesses are destroyed or damaged. In all, six people are killed, and <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> injured.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E

5|$|Davenport uses a mayor-council form {{of local}} {{government}}. , city government consists of mayor Frank Klipsch and a ten-person council. <b>One</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> elected {{from each of}} the eight wards and two at-large aldermen are elected to represent the whole city. Nonpartisan elections are held in odd-numbered years. The mayor is top elected individual for the city. The mayor's duties include running city council meetings and approves or vetoes all actions taken by the council members, and can vote in case of a tie. He or she also appoints city board members. The city council's job is to make laws and set the city budget. The city administrator, currently (no permanent administrator), is appointed by the mayor with confirmation by two-thirds of the council. Citywide goals through 2012 include having a financially responsible government, having a growing economy, revitalizing neighborhoods, and upgrading city infrastructure and public facilities. The establishment of Davenport as a political and government unit came in 1839, three years after the city was settled. The city was incorporated {{as a result of a}} resolution by Iowa Representative Jonathan W. Parker by special charter in the Iowa Territory on January 25, 1839. Parker was a resident of Davenport and one of six trustees elected to govern the city with Rodolphus Bennet being the first mayor. Activity for the first four months was minimal as the council failed to meet. In 1842, the city charter was amended for the first time. Changes include having six alderman replace the five trustees, dividing the city into three wards, and appointing a city clerk position to replace the recorder. The charter was amended again in 1851 to expand the city area, provide greater detail of the duties of the mayor, city council, and other officials. During the last half of the 19th century, government assumed expanding responsibilities for public welfare and public works improvements.|$|E
