Meanwhile, Frank discovers Fauxlivia is pregnant; the adrenaline had induced morning sickness symptoms. At the hospital, the fetus is found to be six weeks old. Frank realizes he was away at that time, accuses Fauxlivia of sleeping with another man, and leaves her. Fauxlivia cries to herself, realizing her child's father is Peter (Joshua Jackson) from her time in the prime universe.|$|E

50|$|However, the {{correlation}} between sharply negative Arctic Oscillations and excessive winter cold and snow in regions vulnerable in that way to these negative AOs should not be overstated. It {{is by no means}} a simple, one-to-one equivalence. An extreme Arctic Oscillation does not necessarily mean extreme weather will occur. For example, since 1950, eight <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 10 <b>coldest</b> Januarys in New York did not coincide with the 10 lowest January AO values. And the fourth warmest January there since 1950 coincided with one of those 10 most negative AOs. So, although many climatologists believe that the Arctic Oscillation affects <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> certain weather events occurring in certain places, <b>the</b> heightened chance <b>of</b> a phenomenon by no means assures it, nor does the lessened likelihood exclude it. Further, <b>the</b> precise value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AO index only imperfectly reflects <b>the</b> severity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weather associated with it.|$|R

Like the season she represents, she's extremely passive and keeps a lot to herself, but she will show her real self and her real feelings if she feels comfortable. Despite her shy personality (or based on Ken's logic, because she is shy) she confesses her love to Ken, although she says {{she just wanted to}} share her feelings with him rather than start a relationship, because she loves the Student Council's atmosphere most of all, implying that even when she loves him she doesn't want to change how things are at the moment.|$|R

25|$|Chemosynthetic {{communities}} thrive where <b>cold</b> fluids seep <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forearc. <b>Cold</b> seep {{communities have}} been discovered in inner trench slopes down to depths of 7000 m in the western Pacific, especially around Japan, in the Eastern Pacific along North, Central and South America coasts from the Aleutian to the Peru–Chile trenches, on the Barbados prism, in the Mediterranean, and in the Indian Ocean along the Makran and Sunda convergent margins. These communities receive much less attention than the chemosynthetic communities associated with hydrothermal vents. Chemosynthetic communities are located {{in a variety of}} geological settings: above over-pressured sediments in accretionary prisms where fluids are expelled through mud volcanoes or ridges (Barbados, Nankai and Cascadia); along active erosive margins with faults; and along escarpments caused by debris slides (Japan trench, Peruvian margin). Surface seeps may be linked to massive hydrate deposits and destabilization (e.g. Cascadia margin). High concentrations of methane and sulfide in the fluids escaping from the seafloor are the principal energy sources for chemosynthesis.|$|R

50|$|During <b>the</b> night <b>of</b> February 22 and {{the very}} early parts of February 23, severe weather formed over Central Florida. Radar data {{indicated}} that several long-lived supercell thunderstorms developed over <b>the</b> eastern Gulf <b>of</b> Mexico late on February 22, affected the Tampa Bay Area, and eventually produced seven tornadoes between about 11 pm on Feb. 22nd and 2:30 am on Feb. 23rd. As these storms swept through Central Florida, the tornadoes killed 42 people and seriously injured more than 260 others. This was the deadliest tornado outbreak in Florida’s history after the storm that killed 17 people on March 31, 1962, in Santa Rosa County. The tornadoes were strong due to an abnormally strong jet stream with warm, humid air <b>out</b> ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> front. This is common in the El Niño phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the Florida dry season (November 1 - April 30). During El Niño the jet stream is typically stronger and further south near or over Florida {{in the winter and}} spring. This greatly increases the odds that conditions will be favorable for strong tornado development.|$|R
