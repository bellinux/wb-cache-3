25|$|Hungarian {{uses the}} umlaut, the acute and double acute accent (unique to Hungarian): ö ü, á é í ó ú and ő ű. The acute accent {{indicates}} the long {{form of a}} vowel (in case of i/í, o/ó, u/ú) while the double acute performs the same function for ö and ü. The acute accent can also indicate a different sound (more <b>open,</b> <b>like</b> in case of a/á, e/é). Both long and short forms of the vowels are listed separately in the Hungarian alphabet but members of the pairs a/á, e/é, i/í, o/ó, ö/ő, u/ú and ü/ű are collated in dictionaries as the same letter.|$|E
500|$|Geastrum pectinatum is an {{inedible}} {{species of}} mushroom {{belonging to the}} earthstar family of fungi. Although young specimens are spherical, fruit body development involves the outer layer of tissue splitting <b>open</b> <b>like</b> a star into 7 to 10 pointed rays that eventually bend back to point downward, revealing a small – [...] broad – spore sac. The spore sac {{is supported by a}} small radially wrinkled stalk. [...] There is a distinct conical opening (peristome) {{at the top of the}} spore sac that is up to [...] long. It is commonly known as the beaked earthstar or the beret earthstar, in reference to the shape of the spore sac and its prominent, protruding peristome. The mass of spores and surrounding cells within the sac, the gleba, is dark-brown, and becomes powdery in mature specimens. Spores are spherical, measuring 4 to 6 micrometers in diameter, with warts on their surfaces. Although uncommon, Geastrum pectinatum has a cosmopolitan distribution, and has been collected in various locations in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa, where it grows on the ground in open woods. Like several other earthstars, crystals of calcium oxalate are found on G.pectinatum, and are thought to be involved in fruit body maturation.|$|E

500|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon hunts most often {{at dawn and}} dusk, when prey are most active, but also nocturnally in cities, particularly during migration periods when hunting at night may become prevalent. Nocturnal migrants taken by peregrines include species as diverse as yellow-billed cuckoo, black-necked grebe, virginia rail, and common quail. The peregrine requires open space in order to hunt, and therefore often hunts over open water, marshes, valleys, fields, and tundra, searching for prey either from a high perch or from the air. Large congregations of migrants, especially species that gather in the <b>open</b> <b>like</b> shorebirds, can be quite attractive to hunting peregrines. Once prey is spotted, it begins its stoop, folding back the tail and wings, with feet tucked. Prey is typically struck and captured in mid-air; the {{peregrine falcon}} strikes its prey with a clenched foot, stunning or killing it with the impact, then turns to catch it in mid-air. If its prey is too heavy to carry, a peregrine will drop {{it to the ground}} and eat it there. If they miss the initial strike, peregrines will chase their prey in a twisting flight. Although previously thought rare, several cases of peregrines contour-hunting, i.e. using natural contours to surprise and ambush prey on the ground, have been reported and even rare cases of prey being pursued on foot. In addition, peregrines have been documented preying on chicks in nests, from birds such as kittiwakes. Prey is plucked before consumption. [...] A recent study showed the presence of peregrines benefits non-preferred species {{while at the same time}} causing a decline in its preferred prey.|$|E

[...] Frey continued: [...] "We decided to create something strange, just {{to see if we could}} do it." [...] Henley then wrote most of the lyrics based on Frey's idea, and sought inspiration for the writing by driving out into the desert as well as from films and theater.|$|E
