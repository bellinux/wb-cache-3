40|$|Mayonnaise {{sauce is}} a nutritious food product with high caloric content, {{which is usually}} {{incorporated}} into other products as an ingredient. The product should be produced under hygienic conditions to avoid its physical and chemical deterioration along with microbial spoilage, which mostly happens {{due to the lack}} of thermal treatment. Mayonnaise is often stored for long periods at room temperature in large plastic containers before consumption. To carry out the investigation, samples of the sauce in large plastic containers and glass jars were obtained directly from a commercial producer. After preliminary quality examinations, they were allocated into 3 lots and stored at 5, 25 or 40 oC for up to 6 months. They were then subjected to physical, chemical, microbiological and organoleptic tests at monthly intervals. The results showed no significant microbial growth even when kept at higher temperatures. Significant chemical changes (autoxidation), however, occurred in both containers at temperatures close to 40 oC. <b>Organoleptic</b> <b>examinations</b> revealed significant changes, especially in color and emulsion stability, which were more evidenced for those stored at higher temperature.

METHOD AND MATERIALS: In 4 years, a multidisciplinary breath odor clinic in Belgium examined 406 patients. The team consisted of an ear, nose, and throat specialist, a periodontologist, occasionally a specialist in internal medicine, and, more recently, a psychiatrist. After the initial visit, each patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment 2 to 6 months later; however, only 143 patients (35 %) showed up for this control visit. The remaining 65 % of the patients answered a mailed questionnaire. RESULTS: About half of the patients who returned no longer had complaints, while 17 % reported no improvement. This group was characterized by imaginary bad breath and manifest psychologic problems. There was also disbelief of their cure, although clinical <b>examination</b> (<b>organoleptic</b> evaluation and volatile sulfide measurement {{by means of a}} portable monitor) did not reveal any oral malodor. Some also insufficiently performed the recommended oral hygiene measures (tongue brushing and interdental cleaning). Most of the patients who returned the questionnaire were disappointed by the suggestion that their halitosis was the result of insufficient oral hygiene. CONCLUSION: Better education of both the public and dental professionals as to the most frequent cause of halitosis, insufficient oral hygiene, might elevate the level of compliance by patients. status: publishe...|$|R

Paracetamol, Salbutamol, Cephalexin, Amoxicillin and Lactulose are few oral liquid medicines prescribed in Sri Lanka. These oral liquid medicines are at a greater risk of microbial contamination during consumption. This can lead to co-infection in paediatric patients. Therefore, it is important to evaluate microbial quality of oral liquid medicines during consumption. In methodology, <b>organoleptic</b> <b>examination,</b> pH determination and assessment of microbiological quality of two bottles from each five commercially available samples were done. Selective media were employed for quantification and isolation of the microbial contaminants. Quantification of viable microbial colonies was expressed as colony forming units per mililitre (cfu/ml).

The effect of fresh or frozen condition of the MDPM {{and the effect of}} days of storage on the finished franks were studied. Backs from which abdominal fat was removed and skinned necks were deboned separately and also in combination (5 : 1, w/w). Frankfurters were prepared from fresh and frozen lots of each type of MDPM. Protein, fat, water, and seasoning were held constant. The products were tested after 1 and 7 days of storage. Evaluation included <b>organoleptic</b> <b>examination</b> by a taste panel, shear values, yields, and proximate analyses. In general, fresh and frozen mechanically deboned backs and backs plus necks and fresh me-chanically deboned necks produced frankfurters with optimum texture (snappiness), tenderness, and juiciness. Franks made from frozen mechanically deboned necks were more mushy. Overall satisfaction scores were best for frankfurters prepared from fresh and frozen mechanically deboned backs and backs plus necks. Overall satisfaction scores for franks made from fresh and frozen mechanically deboned necks were lower, probably due to poor flavor.

40|$|Abstract Halitosis {{is defined}} as a foul odor emanated from the oral cavity, with great impact in quality of life and social restraints. Recently, the use of Breath Alert™ in {{research}} increased significantly. Halimeter™, another portable device, is often used in clinical practice. Nevertheless, not many studies have verified the accuracy and compared the results of both devices simultaneously. Objective: To verify the accuracy of Breath Alert™ and Halimeter™ in patients without chief complaint of halitosis, using the organoleptic test (OT) as "gold standard. " The second aim was to verify whether their concomitant use could enhance the diagnostic accuracy of halitosis. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study was performed. The quality of expired air of 34 subjects without chief complaint of halitosis was assessed. Two experienced examiners carried out the OT. Afterward, a third blinded examiner performed Halimeter™ (HT) and Breath Alert™ (BA) tests. Results: The OT identified halitosis in 21 subjects (62 %). The area under the ROC curve (95 % confidence interval) was 0. 67 (0. 48 - 0. 85) and 0. 54 (0. 34 - 0. 75) for HT and BA, respectively. The accuracy for HT and BA was 59 % and 47 %, respectively. The combined usage of HT and BA provided 11 positive results, being 9 subjects (43 %) out of the total of 21 positive cases. Conclusions: Halimeter™ and Breath Alert™ were not able to diagnose halitosis in non-complainer subjects at the same level as the <b>organoleptic</b> <b>examination,</b> since their accuracy were low.

All animals were males and were hunted in the early morning. The {{experiment}} was set as a randomized trial with four treatments (spring, summer, autumn and winter) and an uneven distribution of animals per treatment. <b>Organoleptic</b> <b>examination</b> of the stomach content revealed that cereals were the most abundant feed ingested (present in 25 % of summer samples and 62. 5 % autumn samples). Results of chemical analysis confirmed a significant seasonal influence on total nitrogen and protein content, fats, cellulose, ash, phosphorus, pH and ammonia nitrogen within {{the content of the}} rumen. Contrary to this, calcium within the dry matter and total mineral content varied regardless of the season. A significantly high protein (360. 84 g/kg DM) and low cellulose content (170. 30 g/kg) was present during the spring season. A high negative correlation (r=- 0. 7398) between protein and cellulose content was present throughout the year.
