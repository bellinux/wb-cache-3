40|$|This paper clarifies the {{structure}} and determinants of <b>overemployment</b> and its two elements, involuntary fulltime employment and involuntary overtime work, after demonstrating {{the fact that for}} the mismatch of work hours that includes both <b>overemployment</b> and underemployment, <b>overemployment</b> prevails in our country. <b>Overemployment</b> is defined here as an excess of actual work hours over desired work hours for an employee. Its extent becomes greater, other things being equal, as the actual hours of work increases, as the desired hours of work decreases, and as the extent of association between actual and desired hours of work becomes weaker. Regular workers compared with irregular/temporary workers and men compared with {{women are more likely to}} experience <b>overemployment</b> despite the fact that the former group have a greater amount of desired work hours than the latter group, because the former's actual work hours exceed the latter's to even a greater extent. In particular, regular workers tend to be more overemployed than irregular/temporary workers primarily because the former's desire to work part time is very unlikely to be granted by the employer, and men tend to be more overemployed than women primarily because the former's desire not to work overtime is much less likely to be granted by the employer among fulltime employees. Other findings include that workplaces that are flexible in time are less likely to cause <b>overemployment,</b> that managers/administrators are more likely than other employees to experience <b>overemployment,</b> that employees with a greater commuting time tend to experience more involuntary fulltime work, and that the gender gap in <b>overemployment</b> becomes the largest among those with a child of less than 6 years old. Finally, the paper discusses measures to mitigate <b>overemployment</b> in our country. ...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARYUnderemployment and <b>overemployment</b> {{represent}} two scenarios whereby {{there is}} a mismatch between an individual's preferred and actual number of work hours. This article examines the levels of underemployment and <b>overemployment</b> in the UK between 2001 and 2010, and describes changes {{at the time of}} the 2008 – 09 recession. Characteristics of the underemployed and the overemployed, in terms of work status, age, sex, qualification, occupation and industry, regions, and earnings, are also presented. These findings are reported while considering the impact of underemployment and <b>overemployment</b> on societal well-being. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the differences in}} the likelihood of overpayment and <b>overemployment</b> in establishments with and without works councils. In contrast to other studies, we use assessments by the management concerning the existence of such problems. Furthermore, we also analyze how different types of works councils influence the probability of <b>overemployment</b> and overpayment. Using the wave 2006 of the IAB Establishment Panel, we show that establishments with works councils that are prepared to interfere with the management are more likely to suffer from <b>overemployment</b> but do not differ in the likelihood of overpayment compared to establishments without works councils. Establishments with works councils that are in line with the management, however, do not differ from establishments without a works council with regard to the likelihood of <b>overemployment</b> but have a lower likelihood of overpayment...|$|E

40|$|This study uses {{subjective}} {{measures of}} well-being to analyze how workers perceive working hours mismatch. Our particular {{interest is in}} {{the question of whether}} workers perceive hours of underemployment differently from hours of <b>overemployment.</b> Previous evidence on this issue is ambiguous. We call attention to the level of well-being in the absence of hours mismatch that serves as a reference state for comparison purposes and to the consequences of restrictive functional form assumptions. Using panel data from Australia and Germany, this study estimates the relationship between working hours mismatch and well-being as a bivariate smooth function of desired hours and mismatch hours by tensor product p-splines. The results indicate that well-being is highest in the absence of hours mismatch. In general, the perception of <b>overemployment</b> is statistically significantly different from the perception of underemployment in both countries. In Australia, workers tolerate some underemployment, as their well-being tends to be unaltered in the presence of short hours of underemployment. However, the marginal loss from underemployment appears to be larger than that from <b>overemployment</b> once the mismatch exceeds approximately ten hours. In Germany, on the contrary, underemployment is clearly more detrimental for well-being than <b>overemployment.</b> German males with preferences for full-time hours hardly respond to <b>overemployment...</b>|$|E

Second, <b>overemployment</b> is a more serious problem than is underemployment. Third, while the magnitude of the impact of <b>overemployment</b> may seem small in absolute terms, relative to other variables, such as disability, the effect is quite large. ...|$|E

40|$|Contrary {{to much of}} the {{established}} literature, this paper finds that though many older workers would prefer to reduce their working hours (the overemployed), there is a significant group who would like to work longer hours (the underemployed). And contrary to the assumption that the self-employed are more easily able than employees to select a desired combination of hours and the wage rate, this paper finds that older self-employed workers are more likely to wish to adjust their hours, both upward and downward than are employees. A new index of underemployment is used to show that for the UK, since the onset of the Great Recession, underemployment among older workers has been growing more rapidly than unemployment. Using longitudinal data from the UK Labour Force Survey, the paper investigates the effects of <b>overemployment</b> and underemployment on transitions from employment and self-employment into other labour market states. It confirms that <b>overemployment</b> is a significant predictor of retirement among employees while underemployed employees are less likely to retire...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{examine what}} determines {{corporate}} effective tax rates (ETR) {{at the firm}} level, using the panel data on 425 listed companies in China's stock market over the seven-year period 1998 - 2004.

The findings from the empirical results are as follows. The firm size and capital intensity of the listed companies seem to have no significant effects on ETR. The impact of leverage on ETR is negative and significant. ETR tends to be smaller for firms with <b>overemployment</b> of labor, which {{may be related to}} incentive policies provided by government to promote employment. Effects of profitability and ownership structure on ETR vary with external tax environments, and they turn out to be positive as all firms enjoy tax incentives. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to provide}} a more detailed insight into the effects of German codetermination rights on employment and productivity. Chapter 2 deals with the impact of German codetermination rights on overtime hours. The main findings are that the effects of works councils strongly depend on the contracted working time and also differ across quantiles of the overtime hours distribution. Chapter 3 analyzes the impact of works councils on discrepancies between preferred and actual working hours of employees. It is shown that employees in codetermined establishments are more likely to match their working time preferences. This positive effect is due to a reduction of <b>overemployment.</b> Chapter 4 examines the differences in the likelihood of overpayment and <b>overemployment</b> in establishments with and without works councils. In contrast to other studies, assessments by the management concerning the existence of such problems are used. The main result is that establishments with works councils that are prepared to interfere with the management are more likely to suffer from <b>overemployment</b> but do not differ in the likelihood of overpayment compared to establishments without works councils. Establishments with works councils that are in line with the management, however, do not differ from establishments without a works council with regard to the likelihood of <b>overemployment</b> but have a lower likelihood of overpayment. In Chapter 5, differences in employment growth between firms with and without works councils by separating introduction effects from potential selectivity effects are examined. Using a difference in differences framework, it is shown that firms with works councils have higher employment growth before establishing a works council. However, employment growth declines after introduction. The reason for lower employment growth is identified in reduced hiring rates but constant dismissal rates. Finally, Chapter 6 contains an estimation of the effect of almost parity codetermination and dispersion of capital ownership of stock companies on productivity. It is shown that a concentration of capital ownership counteracts and neutralizes negative effects of codetermination. Furthermore, productivity-enhancing effects of representation by a capital owner in the supervisory board are revealed if a firm is codetermined...|$|E

40|$|In a {{labor market}} in which firms offer tied hours-wage {{packages}} {{and there is}} substantial dispersion in the wage offers associated with {{a particular type of}} job, the best job available to a worker at a point in time may pay well but require an hours level which is far from the worker's labor supply schedule, or pay poorly but offer desirable hours. Intuitively, one would expect hours constraints to influence the pattern of wage-hours tradeoffs which occur when workers quit to new jobs. Constrained workers may be willing to sacrifice wage gains for better hours. Likewise, workers may accept jobs offering undesirable hours only if the associated wage gains are large. We investigate this issue empirically by examining whether <b>overemployment</b> (underemployment) on the initial job increases (reduces) the partial effect on the wage gain of a positive change in hours for those who quit. We also examine whether <b>overemployment</b> (underemployment) on the new job increases (reduces) the partial effect on the wage gain of a positive change in hours for those who quit. Despite the limitations imposed by small sample sizes and lack of information on the magnitude of hours constraints, our results support the view that an individual requires compensation to work in jobs which, given the individual's particular preferences, offer unattractive hours...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to extend an {{analysis}} of disequilibrium macroeconomics to a problem of capital accumulation. The real wage is assumed to be sluggish so that the labor market may be in disequilibrium. The transaction of labor takes place at the minimum of supply and demand. The interaction between wage adjustment and capital accumulation is studied. If wage adjustment is slow, and if the saving rate from profits is larger than that from wages, then an endogenous force of business cycles switching between unemployment and <b>overemployment</b> regimes can be demonstrated.

We consider a model in which home and foreign workers are perfect substitutes and firms have an informational advantage concerning their productivity. The union offers wage-employment contracts to induce truthtelling. Because of a firm's productivity dependent outside option (producing abroad), the problem is characterized by countervailing incentives. We find that, under fairly mild assumptions {{on the distribution of}} firm's productivity, the overstating incentive always dominates. The equilibrium contract offered by the union is then characterized by <b>overemployment.</b> Besides its effect on the intensive margin, the union also affects the extensive margin (i. e. de-location).

Previous analyses have examined wage determination with an artificial restriction that employment is determined either before or after wage determination has occurred. Here, employment determination is made part of the bargaining process. With two variables being determined, there is bargaining with a variable pie and solutions correspond to equilibria without commitment. Two different notions of efficiency- exchange and pie efficiency- are relevant and serve to characterise equilibria. Multiple equilibria are shown to arise naturally once exchange inefficient proposals are possible. In all equilibria there is <b>overemployment.</b> Factors which restrict a firm’s ability to alter the labour force during or after the wage bargaining process are shown, paradoxically, to benefit the firm...|$|E
40|$|The {{quest for}} {{efficiency}} underlies the reform {{efforts of the}} socialist economies, but job security and <b>overemployment</b> (redundant jobs) still characterize these economies. The author argues that reforming socialist economies have maintained job security not through planning but mainly through a complicated bargaining among coalitions that results in a massive redistribution. This redistribution amounts to a bailing out of the ailing or less productive firms and workers {{at the expense of}} the more productive firms and workers and of the household sector as a whole. The author substantiates his argument with an empirical analysis of the redistribution associated with the soft budget constraint in Yugoslavia in the 1970 s and 1980 s.

Building on previous findings that job change increases the flexibility of actual work hours, the study addresses two as yet neglected questions in the context: (i) How do changes in desired work hours, in addition to changes in actual work hours, contribute to the resolution of these mismatches? (ii) Does the increased flexibility help actually to resolve work hour mismatches? We exploit information about {{the magnitude of the}} prevailing mismatch to improve both the credibility and interpretation of the results.

40|$|When {{a region}} {{successfully}} attracts a large firm by offering tax concessions, outright subsidies etc., the firm often commits itself to performance targets {{in terms of}} investment or employment.

It analyzes a model of two regions which compete for a large firm assuming that the firm's characteristics are ex-ante unknown. We consider direct mechanisms that induce truthful reporting of the firm's type as well as simpler bidding strategies. We find that, first, performance targets are an equilibrium outcome if information is incomplete. Second, these performance targets often induce employment distortions (<b>overemployment</b> in the most plausible case). Third, when the competing regions differ, the winning region may gain from the fact that information is incomplete, i. e. its payoff is greater than it would be under complete information. Finally, when the governments' sets of instruments are restricted to lump-sum payments, simple tax rebates and wage subsidies, incomplete information has no efficiency cost. This implies that restricting both regions' sets of policy instruments may improve efficiency...|$|E
40|$|In {{search of}} a {{macroeconomic}} theory of wage determination, the agnostic reader should be puzzled by the apparent contradiction between two influential theories. On one hand, in the standard search-matching theory with wage bargaining, hiring cost and constant returns of labor, the bargaining power of employees allows them to get rents and gives rise either to <b>overemployment</b> or to under-employment compared with the first-best. On the other hand, in Stole and Zwiebel?s theory of intrafirm bargaining with no hiring cost and decreasing returns of labor, the bargaining power of employees does {{not allow them to}} get rent and always gives rise to over-employment. In this paper, we try to reconcile the approaches. A simple matching model with large firms and diminishing marginal productivity of labor allows us to show that the two limit cases described above yield a mix of robust and non robust results: In the most general case, employees get rents and there is more frequently over employment compared to the efficient allocation than in the standard search-matching model...|$|E

40|$|Firms in many {{situations}} must make investment decisions long before they meet with new capital suppliers. In addition, most physical capital is specific to a task or location, thus implying potentially important switching costs in case negotiations between a firm and a supplier break down. The present paper analyzes {{the implications of these}} frictions. The sequentiality of investment makes it impossible to write binding ex-ante contracts. Together with the rents arising from switching costs, this implies a holdup problem. In partial equilibrium, firms react strategically by overinvesting so as to reduce their marginal productivity and thus the price of capital they negotiate with their suppliers upon matching. In general equilibrium, the holdup problem interacts with externalities from switching costs, resulting in inefficient allocations. In a more general macroeconomic context, the holdup problem in physical capital markets interacts with holdup problems in labor markets that typically lead to underinvestment. As long as capital and labor are complements, this presents the firm with a trade-off between overinvestment and <b>overemployment</b> that neutralizes, at least partially, the distortionary effects of each of the two holdup problems.
