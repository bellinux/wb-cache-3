Objective: The aim of this study was the evaluation of <b>oocytes</b> activation by addition of calcium ionophore in unfertilized <b>oocytes</b> in ICSI cycles. Materials and Methods: This study was done on 15 ICSI cycles (stimulated with standard long protocol). Mature retrieved <b>oocytes</b> with normal morphology that had no evidence of fertilization 24 hours after ICSI were included in the study. The <b>oocytes</b> with fertilization and unfertilized <b>oocytes</b> with degeneration were excluded from the study. The unfertilized <b>oocytes</b> were washed with GIVF medium and were transferred to GIVF medium that contained 5 μmol of calcium ionophore and were incubated for 10 minutes.

40|$|AbstractOocytes of {{wild-type}} mice are ovulated as {{the secondary}} <b>oocytes</b> arrested at metaphase {{of the second}} meiotic division. Their fertilization or parthenogenetic activation triggers {{the completion of the}} second meiotic division followed by the first embryonic interphase. <b>Oocytes</b> of the LT/Sv strain of mice are ovulated either at the first meiotic metaphase (M I) as primary <b>oocytes</b> or in the second meiotic metaphase (M II) as secondary <b>oocytes.</b> We show here that duringin vitromaturation a high proportion of LT/Sv <b>oocytes</b> progresses normally only until metaphase I. In these <b>oocytes</b> MAP kinase activates shortly after histone H 1 kinase (MPF) activation and germinal vesicle breakdown. However, MAP kinase activation is slightly earlier than in <b>oocytes</b> from wild-type F 1 (CBA/H × C 57 Bl/ 10) mice. The first meiotic spindle of these <b>oocytes</b> forms similarly to wild-type <b>oocytes.</b> During aging, however, it increases in size and finally degenerates. In those <b>oocytes</b> which do not remain in metaphase I the extrusion of first polar bodies is highly delayed and starts about 15 h after germinal vesicle breakdown. Most of the <b>oocytes</b> enter interphase directly after first polar body extrusion. Fusion between metaphase I LT/Sv <b>oocytes</b> and wild-type mitotic one-cell embryos results in prolonged M-phase arrest of hybrids in a proportion similar to control LT/Sv <b>oocytes</b> and control hybrids made by fusion of two M I LT/Sv <b>oocytes.</b> This indicates that LT/Sv <b>oocytes</b> develop cytostatic factor during metaphase I. Eventually, anaphase occurs spontaneously and the hybrids extrude the polar body and form pronuclei in a proportion similar as in controls. In hybrids between LT/Sv metaphase I <b>oocytes</b> and wild-type metaphase II <b>oocytes</b> (which contain cytostatic factor) anaphase I proceeds at the time observed in control LT/Sv <b>oocytes</b> and hybrids between two M I LT/Sv <b>oocytes,</b> and is followed by the parthenogenetic activation and formation of interphase nuclei. Also the great majority of hybrids between M I and M II wild-type <b>oocytes</b> undergoes the anaphase but further arrests in a subsequent M-phase. These observations suggest that an internally triggered anaphase I occurs despite the presence of the cytostatic activity both in LT/Sv and wild-type M I <b>oocytes.</b> Anaphase I triggering mechanism must therefore either inactivate or override the CSF activity. The comparison between spontaneous and induced activation of metaphase I LT/Sv <b>oocytes</b> shows that mechanisms involved in anaphase I triggering are altered in these <b>oocytes.</b> Thus, the prolongation of metaphase I in LT/Sv <b>oocytes</b> seems to be determined by delayed anaphase I triggering and not provoked directly by the cytostatic activity...|$|R

The results were correlated with the developmental capacity of <b>oocytes</b> after IVM and IVF. For the experiments the cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) were evaluated morphologically and classified into 4 groups: Compact cumulus oophorus (class I), slightly expanded cumulus oophorus (class II), expanded cumulus cells (class III) and denuded <b>oocytes</b> (class IV). There was a clear relationship between chromatin configuration and morphology of freshly recovered COCs. More class II <b>oocytes</b> showed diakinesis after 4 hrs of IVM when compared to class I <b>oocytes.</b> After 20 hrs of IVM, the percentage of <b>oocytes</b> in metaphase II was 16. 2 %, 43 % and 70 % in class I, II and III <b>oocytes,</b> respectively. Signs of degeneration and activation could be observed in <b>oocytes</b> with an expanded cumulus oophorus (class III) {{at the end of the}} IVM period. Meiosis was mostly irregular in denuded <b>oocytes</b> (class IV). Mitochondrial aggregation and activity was correlated with time of IVM, morphology of COCs and chromatin configuration. <b>Oocytes</b> from class I and II had evenly finely dispersed mitochondria wich turned into a crystalline appearance during IVM, mostly notably at time when energy consuming events like MI-spindle formation or extrusion of the first polar body occurred. Only in class II <b>oocytes</b> these changes could be detected as early as 20 hrs after start of IVM. An increase of mitochondrial activity could be observed in the early phase of IVM in class I and II <b>oocytes,</b> the latter having the highest increase of activity. Diplotan, diakinesis and metaphase II were the stages of meiosis with the highest mitochondrial activity of <b>oocytes.</b> Apoptosis of cumulus cells increased during IVM, especially in class III <b>oocytes.</b> The active form of caspase- 3 could be observed in cumulus cells of COCs from class I-IV. In <b>oocytes</b> from all classes the inactive form of caspase- 3, but no active caspase- 3, could be observed. <b>Oocytes</b> of class I and II provided the highest rates of cleavage and blastocyst formation.

25|$|Oocytes can be {{collected}} from most mammalian species. Conventional <b>oocyte</b> collection is when ovaries {{are removed from}} a donor animal; this is done posthumously in slaughter facilities. The ovaries are kept warm as they are brought back to a laboratory for <b>oocyte</b> collection. Keeping the ovaries warm helps increase the success rate of fertilization. Once collected the oocytes are assessed and categorized into small, medium, and large, and then matured for 20–23 hours. This simple, inexpensive technique can lead to about 24 oocytes collected from a bovine. Conventional <b>oocyte</b> collection is especially useful for females who unexpectedly die or who are incapable of being bred due to injury. A second option for <b>oocyte</b> collection is to utilize the transvaginal ultrasound guided <b>oocyte</b> collection method otherwise known as TUGA.

Aging of female mice was associated with 1) decreased number of ovulated oocytes; 2) increased percentage of cumulus-free oocytes; 3) raised per-centage of <b>oocytes</b> with intracellular mitochondrial aggregates; 4) reduced percentage of <b>oocytes</b> displaying a normal distribu-tion of chromosomes in the metaphase-II plate; 5) increased per-centage of normal <b>oocytes</b> exhibiting a DNA-containing polar body (PB); 6) higher percentage of <b>oocytes</b> with chromosome scattering; 7) increased percentage of chromosome-scattered <b>oocytes</b> without a DNA-containing PB and with intracytoplasmic mitochondrial aggregates; 8) raised percentage of <b>oocytes</b> ex-hibiting chromosome decondensation; 9) lower percentage of chromosome-decondensed <b>oocytes</b> lacking both a DNA-contain-ing PB and intracytoplasmic mitochondrial aggregates; 10) in-creased percentage of abnormal/degenerated oocytes; 11) re-duced percentage of abnormal/degenerated <b>oocytes</b> displaying cellular fragmentation; and 12) higher percentage of abnormal/ degenerated <b>oocytes</b> with mitochondrial aggregates exhibiting no nuclear/chromosomal DNA fluorescence, cellular fragmen-tation, milky or dark cytoplasm, or cellular remains enclosed by the zona pellucida. Although several studies suggest aging fe-males may ovulate aged or overripened <b>oocytes,</b> these data sup-port the hypothesis that old females ovulate an increased per-centage of atretic/apoptotic <b>oocytes</b> coming from rescued fol-licles that would have become atretic earlier in life. aging, apoptosis, gamete biology, meiosis, ovulatio...|$|R
