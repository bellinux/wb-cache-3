The colours 0/100/100/0 in the CMYK process, PMS 032 (flag red 100%), or PMS 485 (used for screens) in the Pantone colour specifier can be used when reproducing the flag. For the Federal Identity Program, the red tone of the standard flag has an RGB value of 255–0–0 (web hexadecimal #FF0000).

Hung was replaced by Yuen Woo-ping, an action choreographer with experience ranging from 1960s Hong Kong action cinema to more recent films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Matrix.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, {{including}} his {{time spent in}} Lecumberri Prison, Siqueiros produced a series of politically themed lithographs, {{many of which were}} exhibited in the United States. His lithograph Head was shown at the 1930 exhibition [...] "Mexican Artists and Artists of the Mexican School" [...] at The Delphic Studios in New York City. In 1932, he led an exhibition and conference entitled [...] "Rectifications on Mexican Muralism" [...] at the gallery of the Spanish Casino in Taxco, Guerrero. Shortly after, he traveled to New York, where he participated in the Weyhe Gallery's [...] "Mexican Graphic Art" [...] exhibition. Also in 1932, Nelbert Chouinard invited Siqueiros to Los Angeles to conduct mural workshops. It was at this time that, with a team of students, he also completed Tropical America in 1932, at the Italian Hall at Olvera Street in Los Angeles. Painting fresco on an outside wall – visible to passersby as well as intentional viewers – forced Siqueiros to reconsider his methodology as a muralist. He wanted the image – an Indian peon being crucified by American oppression – to be accessible from multiple angles. Instead of just constructing [...] "an enlarged easel painting," [...] he realized that the mural [...] "must conform to the normal transit of a spectator." [...] Eventually, Siqueiros would develop a mural technique that involved tracing figures onto a wall with an electric projector, photographing early wall sketches to improve perspective, and new paints, spray guns, and other tools to accommodate the surface of modern buildings and the <b>outdoor</b> <b>conditions.</b> He was unceremoniously deported from the United States for political activity the same year.|$|E

Using the single camera situated on the robot, the robot can perceive different terrains. There are some de-merits of our system, which are, our algorithm is not perfect all the time; but with a consensus over multiple test on same scenario, we can stabilize it. The advantages of our algorithm are it is fast, real-time, and especially un-supervised. That is, it needs not any training a priori for a particular unknown terrain. The experimental results show that in both indoor or <b>outdoor</b> <b>condition,</b> if the light is not reflected, our algorithm achieves good terrain perception, even {{when there is a}} motion blur.|$|R
