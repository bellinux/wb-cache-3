25|$|In general, if {{the nature}} of the {{population}} distribution is known a priori, it is possible to test if the number <b>of</b> <b>outliers</b> deviate significantly from what can be expected: for a given cutoff (so samples fall beyond the cutoff with probability p) of a given distribution, the number <b>of</b> <b>outliers</b> will follow a binomial distribution with parameter p, which can generally be well-approximated by the Poisson distribution with λ = pn. Thus if one takes a normal distribution with cutoff 3 standard deviations from the mean, p is approximately 0.3%, and thus for 1000 trials one can approximate the number of samples whose deviation exceeds 3 sigmas by a Poisson distribution with λ = 3.|$|E
25|$|Least {{absolute}} deviation (LAD) regression is a robust estimation technique {{in that it}} is less sensitive to the presence <b>of</b> <b>outliers</b> than OLS (but is less efficient than OLS when no outliers are present). It is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation under a Laplace distribution model for ε.|$|E
25|$|Deletion of outlier data is a {{controversial}} practice frowned upon by many scientists and science instructors; while mathematical criteria provide an objective and quantitative method for data rejection, {{they do not}} make the practice more scientifically or methodologically sound, especially in small sets or where a normal distribution cannot be assumed. Rejection <b>of</b> <b>outliers</b> is more acceptable in areas of practice where the underlying model of the process being measured and the usual distribution of measurement error are confidently known. An outlier resulting from an instrument reading error may be excluded but it is desirable that the reading is at least verified.|$|E

25|$|In most larger {{samplings}} of data, {{some data}} points will be {{further away from}} the sample mean than what is deemed reasonable. This can be due to incidental systematic error or flaws in the theory that generated an assumed family of probability distributions, {{or it may be}} that some observations are far {{from the center of the}} data. Outlier points can therefore indicate faulty data, erroneous procedures, or areas where a certain theory might not be valid. However, in large samples, a small number <b>of</b> <b>outliers</b> is to be expected (and not due to any anomalous condition).|$|E
25|$|Outliers {{can occur}} by chance in any distribution, {{but they often}} {{indicate}} either measurement error or that the population has a heavy-tailed distribution. In the former case one wishes to discard them or use statistics that are robust to outliers, while {{in the latter case}} they indicate that the distribution has high skewness and that one should be very cautious in using tools or intuitions that assume a normal distribution. A frequent cause <b>of</b> <b>outliers</b> is a mixture of two distributions, which may be two distinct sub-populations, or may indicate 'correct trial' versus 'measurement error'; this is modeled by a mixture model.|$|E
25|$|An {{explanation}} for this log-normal distribution for biological parameters is: The event where a sample has half {{the value of the}} mean or median tends to have almost equal probability to occur as the event where a sample has twice the value of the mean or median. Also, only a log-normal distribution can compensate for the inability of almost all biological parameters to be of negative numbers (at least when measured on absolute scales), with the consequence that there is no definite limit to the size <b>of</b> <b>outliers</b> (extreme values) on the high side, but, on the other hand, they can never be less than zero, resulting in a positive skewness.|$|E

500|$|Jason Cowley, {{reviewing}} {{the book in}} The Guardian, felt that Outliers was an argument between Gladwell and himself, referring to the many times that he uses the word [...] "we" [...] when defining his position, {{such as in the}} example: [...] "There is something profoundly wrong with the way we look at success. [...] We cling to the idea that success is a simple function of individual merit and that {{the world in which we}} grow up and the rules we choose to write as a society don't matter at all." [...] He also believed that there was a [...] "certain one-dimensional Americanness at work", observing that many of Gladwell's examples are from the United States, particularly in New York City. In an article about the book for The New York Times, Steven Pinker wrote, [...] "The reasoning in 'Outliers,' which consists of cherry-picked anecdotes, post-hoc sophistry and false dichotomies, had me gnawing on my Kindle."

This random limit depends on {{the values of the}} process at the outliers’ time points and on the values at the preceding time points and in case <b>of</b> additive <b>outliers</b> also on the values at the following time points.

The second-most cited article in Acta Crystallographica SectionA in 2008 only had 28 citations. It is also important to note that impact factor is a journal metric and should not be used to assess individual researchers or institutions.|$|E

Even while praising Gladwell's writing style and content, Pinker summed up Gladwell as [...] "a minor genius who unwittingly demonstrates the hazards of statistical reasoning", while accusing him of [...] "cherry-picked anecdotes, post-hoc sophistry and false dichotomies" [...] in his book Outliers.
