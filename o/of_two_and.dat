5|$|A charter {{granted in}} 1363 by David II, King of Scots (reigned 1329–71), awarded the burgh {{the right to}} trade across the regality of Dunfermline. This charter allowed the burgesses of Kirkcaldy to {{purchase}} and sell goods to the burgesses of the three other regality burghs—Queensferry, Dunfermline and Musselburgh—that belonged to the Abbey. By 1451, Kirkcaldy was awarded feu-ferme status.

5|$|Copeland {{was born}} in Kansas City, Missouri, {{and raised in the}} San Pedro {{community}} of Los Angeles, California. Copeland's father, Doug Copeland, is German American and African American, while her mother, Sylvia DelaCerna, is Italian American and African American and was adopted by African American parents. Misty Copeland is the youngest of four children from her mother's second marriage and has two younger half-siblings, one each from her mother's third and fourth marriages. Copeland did not see her father between the ages <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> twenty-two. Her mother, a former Kansas City Chiefs cheerleader, had studied dance. She is a trained medical assistant, but worked mostly in sales.|$|E
5|$|Day-Lewis {{was born}} in Kensington, London, the son of poet Cecil Day-Lewis and English actress Jill Balcon. His father, who {{was born in}} Ballintubbert, County Laois, Ireland, was of Protestant Anglo-Irish and English background, lived in England from the age <b>of</b> <b>two,</b> <b>and</b> later became the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom. Day-Lewis's mother was Jewish; her {{ancestors}} were Jewish immigrants to England from Latvia and Poland. His maternal grandfather, Sir Michael Balcon, was the head of Ealing Studios. Two years after his birth, his family moved to Croom's Hill, Greenwich, south-east London, where Day-Lewis grew up along with his older sister, Tamasin, who became a documentary filmmaker and television chef.|$|E
5|$|Depending on maturity, breed, {{and work}} expected, horses are usually put under saddle and {{trained to be}} ridden between the ages <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> four. Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as {{the age of two}} in some countries, horses {{specifically}} bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed. For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60calendar months (five years) old.|$|E

2500|$|Normally, {{humans have}} {{haemoglobin}} A, which consists <b>of</b> <b>two</b> alpha <b>and</b> <b>two</b> beta chains, haemoglobin A2, which consists <b>of</b> <b>two</b> alpha <b>and</b> <b>two</b> delta chains, <b>and</b> haemoglobin F, consisting <b>of</b> <b>two</b> alpha <b>and</b> <b>two</b> gamma chains in their bodies. Out {{of these three}} types, haemoglobin F dominates until about 6 weeks of age. Afterwards, haemoglobin A dominates throughout life. [...] In people diagnosed with sickle cell disease, {{at least one of}} the β-globin subunits in hemoglobin A is replaced with what's known as hemoglobin S. In sickle cell anemia, a common form of sickle cell disease, hemoglobin S replaces both β-globin subunits in the hemoglobin.|$|R
50|$|Composite {{subatomic}} particles (such as protons or atomic nuclei) are bound states <b>of</b> <b>two</b> or more elementary particles.

The neutron is made <b>of</b> <b>two</b> down quarks <b>and</b> one up quark. Composite particles include all hadrons: these include baryons (such as protons and neutrons) and mesons (such as pions and kaons).|$|R
5|$|During World War II, most fruits rich in vitamin C, such as oranges, became {{difficult}} to obtain in the United Kingdom. Since blackcurrant berries are {{a rich source of}} the vitamin and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate, the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation's crop increased significantly. From 1942 onwards, blackcurrant syrup was distributed free of charge to children under the age <b>of</b> <b>two,</b> <b>and</b> this may have given rise to the lasting popularity of blackcurrant as a flavouring in Britain. In Britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown, mostly under contract to the juicing industry. Commercially, most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye 007 was {{developed}} {{over a period}} <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> a half years by an inexperienced team.

The game was highly acclaimed by the gaming media and sold over eight million copies worldwide, making it the third-best-selling Nintendo 64 game. It received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Games Award and four awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} shot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara, in the {{southern}} state of Karnataka, over a span <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> a half years. After the Central Board of Film Certification mandated the removal of several violent scenes, Sholay was released with a length of 198minutes. In 1990, the original director's cut of 204minutes became available on home media. When first released, Sholay received negative critical reviews and a tepid commercial response, but favourable word-of-mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success. It broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across India, and ran {{for more than five years}} at Mumbai's Minerva theatre. By some accounts, Sholay was the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, adjusted for inflation.|$|E
