40|$|Mathematics {{is tough}} sledding for many. The {{difficulty}} is that most students fail to appreciate that mathematics is "just a language. " It {{happens to be a}} very rigorous language, one with very little ambiguity associated with its symbols. It's also a very abstract one. And it's primarily the latter attribute, abstractness, which causes many students to falter. In this paper an attempt has been made to present design, development and implementation of software, “Java Mathematical Kit” (JMK). It aims to establish a framework to support solutions of various mathematical problems by using click and done methodology. The JMK is mathematical software, which has some unique features (Step Evaluator, etc.); which are not available in <b>other</b> mathematical <b>software.</b> The <b>original</b> publication is available at JAIST Press [URL] 2005 : Proceedings of the First World Congress of the International Federation for Systems Research : The New Roles of Systems Sciences For a Knowledge-based Society : Nov. 14 - 17, 2140, Kobe, JapanSymposium 7, Session 3 : Foundations of the Systems Sciences Models and Application...|$|R
