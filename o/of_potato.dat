5|$|In about 1840, L. decemlineata {{adopted the}} {{cultivated}} potato into its host range and it rapidly became a most destructive pest <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> crops. They are today {{considered to be}} the most important insect defoliator of potatoes. They may also cause significant damage to tomato and eggplant crops with both adults and larvae feeding on the plant's foliage. Larvae may defoliate potato plants resulting in yield losses of up to 100% if the damage occurs prior to tuber formation. Larvae may consume 40cm2 <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> leaves during the entire larval stage, but adults are capable of consuming 10cm2 of foliage per day.|$|E

5|$|The {{potatoes}} {{were chosen}} {{because they were}} deemed substantially equivalent to non-genetically modified Desiree Red potatoes. The study used two transgenic lines <b>of</b> <b>potato,</b> both with the GNA gene inserted. They were grown in the same conditions as the non-genetically modified parent plant. According to Pusztai, the potatoes were not substantially equivalent, {{as one of the}} transgenic lines contained 20 percent less protein than the other, and the starch and sugar contents varied by up to 20 percent among the three lines. Pusztai claimed that these differences were reason enough to discontinue further experimentation.|$|E

5|$|As soon as Glynne {{graduated}} she {{was offered}} a post in the University College of North Wales department of agriculture, but {{within a few months}} she was volunteering at Rothamsted Experimental Station where E. John Russell was director. Winifred Brenchley, the first woman to work in agricultural sciences, soon offered her a permanent assistant botanist position at Rothamsted, where she remained for 43 years. Glynne was one of the original members of the Mycology Department in 1918 and later founded the Plant Pathology Department. Glynne's first major work was studying Synchytrium endobioticum, the cause <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> wart disease. A modified version of her method for identifying varieties resistant to the disease, the Glynne-Lemmerzahl method, is still in use today.

5|$|Frying food {{in olive}} oil is attested in Classical Greece from about the 5th century BCE. The late Roman {{cookbook}} of Apicius (c. 400), appears to list the ancient Romans' first use of deep frying to prepare Pullum Frontonianum, a chicken dish. The practice of deep frying spread {{to other parts of}} Europe and Arabia in the following centuries. Deep-fried foods such as funnel cakes arrived in northern Europe by the 13th century, and deep-fried fish recipes have been found in cookbooks in Spain and Portugal at around the same time. Falafel arrived in the Middle East from population migrations from Egypt as soon as the 14th century. The deep frying of food in Japan was likely introduced by Portuguese the 16th century. Evidence <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> frying can be found as early as the late 17th century in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} beetle have evolved {{immunity}} to insecticides. For example, the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is a destructive pest <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> plants. Its hosts include {{other members of}} the Solanaceae, such as nightshade, tomato, eggplant and capsicum, as well as the potato. Different populations have between them developed resistance to all major classes of insecticide. The Colorado potato beetle was evaluated as a tool of entomological warfare during World War II, the idea being to use the beetle and its larvae to damage the crops of enemy nations. Germany tested its Colorado potato beetle weaponisation program south of Frankfurt, releasing 54,000 beetles.|$|E
5|$|However, modern {{agriculture}} seriously reduces biodiversity. Traditional {{third world}} agriculture that is best at maintaining diversity with multiple cropping systems such aspolyculture(includingcompanion plantingandintercropping) andagroforestrysystems such as shifting cultivation. In Latin America, between 70% and 90% of beans are grown mixed with other {{crops such as}} maize and potatoes. Worldwide, multiple cropping provided up to 20% of all food in 1986. Traditional systems also maintain diversity within a crop species, such as in theAndesmountains where up to 50 varieties <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> are grown.The effects of loss of biodiversity are especially noticeable in pest control. Herbivorous pest insects tend to become more abundant inmonocultures. Stable agroecosystems are biodiverse and contain sufficient numbers of natural enemies of crop pests, such asparasitoidalwasps which are able to controlaphidsandlepidopterancaterpillars. These ecosystems continuously provide food and breeding sites for these beneficial species. Agroecosystems can achieve this equilibrium by arranging a suitable combination of crops in space and time, given the type of soil and surrounding environment; sufficient abundance of non-crop plants in and around fields; and appropriate management of vegetation. Suitable farming strategies include polyculture,crop rotation, mosaics of small scattered fields and uncultivated land. Additional strategies include perennial crops such asorchards(especially if a diverse floral undergrowth is permitted), tolerating specific weed species, and raising genetic diversity such as by planting mixtures of crop varieties.|$|E

40|$|Summary. According to data on {{norms of}} {{consumption}} of vegetable production {{of scientific research}} institute of Food of the Russian Academy <b>of</b> Medical Science, <b>potatoes</b> win first place with norm of 120 kg {{a year on the}} person. In this regard much attention is paid to processing <b>of</b> <b>potatoes</b> that allows to prolong the term of its validity, and also to reduce the capacity of storages and to reduce transport transportations as 1 kg <b>of</b> a dry <b>potatoes</b> produсt is equivalent 7 - 8 kg <b>of</b> fresh <b>potatoes.</b> Thus industrial processing <b>of</b> <b>potatoes</b> on dry mashed potatoes allows to reduce losses <b>of</b> <b>potatoes</b> at storage and transportation, there is a possibility of enrichment of products vitamins and other useful components, its nutrition value remains better, conditions for complex processing of raw materials with full recycling and creations of stocks <b>of</b> products from <b>potatoes</b> on a crop failure case are created. Dry mashed potatoes are a product of long storage. On the basis of studying of the production technology <b>of</b> mashed <b>potatoes</b> the analysis <b>of</b> technological processes as sources of creation of waste, and the directions of recovery of secondary raw materials for complex waste-free technology <b>of</b> processing <b>of</b> <b>potatoes</b> are defined is provided.
