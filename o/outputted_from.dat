40|$|The {{inappropriate}} use of agricultural land has caused several environmental and socio-economic problems. Fuzzy multiple objectives linear programming (FMOLP) is a mathematical technique {{that can be}} effective in land use planning. It requires decision variable coefficients (DVCs) to formulate the problem model covering all environmental and socio-economic aspects. The solution from a formulated FMOLP model provides optimal land use proportion and then the proportion is relocated t o produce the land use planning map. The map is then transferred to the soil and water assessment tools (SWAT) for assessing the impacts. The SWAT results give out a value which differs from the initial DVCs in the comparable aspects. This difference indicates that the initial DVCs were not realistic for the selected watershed and the land use planning map were not optimal. This study attempts to reevaluate DVCs in the FMOLP model by designing a method of sustainable agricultural land-use planning which makes use of the <b>outputted</b> results <b>from</b> the SWAT model.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{learning}} and inference framework, Composite Statis-tical Learning and Inference (CSLI), for random fields with extremely high order interactions. Instead of conventional probabilistic approaches that build models on clique potentials, we propose to focus on subset statistics from overlapping ran-dom variable subsets and employ composite likelihood approaches for learning and inference. Focusing on subset statistics avoids the need to consider normal-ization constants in both learning and inference. Learning becomes a conventional (weighted) regression problem, and inference is also greatly simplified since the subset statistics are of much lower dimensionality than the initial random variables. We present an inference algorithm on the semantic segmentation problem in com-puter vision, where the statistic of choice is maximal class-specific overlap. Con-tinuous parameters are defined on superpixels obtained by multiple intersections of segments, then the optimal segments are <b>outputted</b> <b>from</b> the inferred superpixel statistics.

This study emphasizes the comparison of the two approaches in data production, updating and analysis. Architectural CAD drawings are <b>outputted</b> <b>from</b> design information through a computational interface.

The output interface is the method of presenting architecture drawings like plans, elevations, sections and details based on input data. Under the constraints of a predefined data structure, the computational interface determines the efficiency and characteristics of input and output data. Drawing production methods can be classified into three types: segregating drawing files, applying reference files and constructing a virtual building model. These types come with different interfaces: 2 D drafting has the same input and output interface, whereas constructing a 3 D model is achieved using a different interface.
