5|$|In December 2013, clashes {{involving}} tribal militias, Iraqi security forces, and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) {{broke out}} throughout western Iraq. Then, in January 2014, ISIL militants successfully took control <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah</b> and Ramadi, bringing much of Anbar Province under their control.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the elections, a CH-53E {{helicopter}} crashed near Al-Rutbah on 26 January, killing all 31 Marines and sailors, most of whom were members of 1st Battalion 3rd Marines and who had survived the Second Battle <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah.</b> This was the single deadliest incident for US troops in the Iraq War.|$|E
5|$|Following the Second Battle <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah,</b> the Marines faced {{three main}} tasks: {{providing}} humanitarian {{assistance to the}} hundreds of thousands of refugees returning to the city, retaking the numerous towns and cities they had abandoned along the Euphrates in the run-up to the battle, and providing security for the Iraqi parliamentary elections scheduled for 30 January.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, most <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah's</b> {{civilian}} population fled the city, which greatly reduced {{the potential for}} noncombatant casualties. U.S. military officials estimated that 70-90% of the 300,000 civilians in the city fled before the attack.|$|R

5|$|In July 2014, the Pentagon {{announced}} that Apaches had been dispatched to Baghdad to protect embassy personnel from Islamic State militant attacks. On 4 October 2014, Apaches began performing missions in Operation Inherent Resolve against Islamic State ground forces. In October 2014, U.S. Army AH-64s and Air Force fighters participated in four air strikes on Islamic State units northeast <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah.</b> In June 2016, Apaches {{were used in}} support of the Iraqi Army's Mosul offensive and provided support during the Battle of Mosul, sometimes flying night missions supporting Iraqi operations.|$|E
5|$|For the American forces, abuses were {{typically}} either a disproportionate use of firepower or servicemen committing extrajudicial killings (such as in Haditha). Many accusations {{of human rights}} violations against the United States were connected with the First and Second Battles <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah.</b> Following the assault, the United States military admitted it had employed white phosphorus artillery rounds, the use of which is not permitted in civilian areas under the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. Several Marines, all {{of them from the}} 3rd Battalion 1st Marines, were later charged (but not convicted) with executing Iraqi prisoners. Some British advisers also complained that the Marines had little regard for civilian casualties and had used munitions containing depleted uranium that caused birth defects for years after the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Iraq War in Anbar Province, {{also known}} as the Al Anbar campaign, {{consisted}} of fighting between the United States military, together with Iraqi Government forces, and Sunni insurgents in the western Iraqi province of Al Anbar. The Iraq War lasted from 2003 to 2011, but the majority of the fighting and counterinsurgency campaign in Anbar took place between April 2004 and September 2007. Although the fighting initially featured heavy urban warfare primarily between insurgents and U.S. Marines, insurgents in later years focused on ambushing the American and Iraqi security forces with improvised explosive devices (IED's), large scale attacks on combat outposts, and car bombings. Almost 9,000 Iraqis and 1,335 Americans were killed in the campaign, many in the Euphrates River Valley and the Sunni Triangle around the cities <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah</b> and Ramadi.|$|E
50|$|On 3 May, the Iraqi Army {{and allied}} militia forces {{launched}} an offensive {{in the southern}} Fallujah area, capturing the areas between Amiriyah and Fallujah city. By the next day, Iraqi Government forces had come within 3 kilometers <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah's</b> southern entrance, capturing 4 villages, killing 100 ISIL militants, and destroying 10 ISIL tunnels. On 5 May, Anbar Operations Commander Major General Ismail Mahlawi told Anadolu Agency that the Iraqi army had captured five areas of the city.|$|R

5000|$|The siege {{forced the}} closing <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah's</b> two main hospitals, Fallujah General Hospital and the Jordanian Hospital, which were re-opened during the ceasefire on 9 April 2004. [...] Also on that date, the port visit to Jebel Ali by the {{aircraft}} carrier [...] was cancelled, and the George Washington carrier strike group and its embarked Carrier Air Wing Seven were ordered to remain on station in the Persian Gulf as fighting intensified between Coalition Forces and Iraqi insurgents around Fallujah.|$|R
5|$|Al Anbar, {{the only}} Sunni-dominated {{province}} in Iraq, saw little {{fighting in the}} initial invasion. Following the fall of Baghdad it was occupied by the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division. Violence began on 28 April 2003 when 17 Iraqis were killed in Fallujah by U.S. soldiers during an anti-American demonstration. In early 2004 the U.S. Army relinquished command of the province to the Marines. By April 2004 the province was in full-scale revolt. Savage fighting occurred in both Fallujah and Ramadi {{by the end of}} 2004, including the Second Battle <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah.</b> Violence escalated throughout 2005 and 2006 as the two sides struggled to secure the Western Euphrates River Valley. During this time, Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) became the province's main Sunni insurgent group and turned the provincial capital of Ramadi into its stronghold. The Marine Corps issued an intelligence report in late 2006 declaring that the province would be lost without a significant additional commitment of troops.|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, several tribes {{located in}} Ramadi {{and led by}} Sheikh Abdul Sattar Abu Risha began to form what would {{eventually}} become the Anbar Awakening, which later led to the tribes revolting against AQI. The Anbar Awakening helped turn the tide against the insurgents through 2007. American and Iraqi tribal forces regained control of Ramadi in early 2007, {{as well as other}} cities such as Hīt, Haditha, and Rutbah. More hard fighting still followed throughout the Summer of 2007 however, particularly in the rural western River Valley, due largely to its proximity to the Syrian border and the vast network of natural entry points for foreign fighters to enter Iraq, via Syria. In June 2007 the U.S. turned a majority of its attention to eastern Anbar Province and secured the cities <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah</b> and Al-Karmah.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{military}} in Anbar Province {{had a series}} of reorganizations in late 2009 and early 2010. The last non-American foreign forces left Iraq on 31 July 2009 and Multi-National Forces West became United States Force– West. On 23 January 2010, the Marines formally left both Anbar Province and Iraq, transferring American military commitments over to the United States Army's 1st Armored Division. The Army promptly merged United States Division West with United States Division– Baghdad, creating United States Division– Center to advise Iraqi forces in both Anbar and Baghdad. In December 2010, the 25th Infantry Division assumed responsibility for Anbar Province. On 7 December, the United States transferred its last base in Anbar Province, Al Asad, to the Iraqi Government. One week later, hundreds <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah</b> residents celebrated the pullout by burning American flags in the city.|$|E
25|$|The Marine Corps’ {{military}} operations in urban terrain doctrine recognizes that tactical success does not necessarily translate to strategic victory. It notes the Israeli’s tactical victory in Beirut was a strategic defeat—and observes the same about the Battle of Hue in the Vietnam War, when Marines defeated an enemy that sought {{to put up a}} good fight but never expected to win. Much {{the same can be said}} <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah’s</b> defenders. In spite of the beating they took in November, they will continue to assert they repelled the initial attack and fought well thereafter.|$|R
5000|$|Residents {{were allowed}} to return to the city in mid-December 2004 after {{undergoing}} biometric identification, provided they wear their ID cards all the time. US officials report that [...] "more than half <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah's</b> 39,000 homes were damaged during Operation Phantom Fury, and about 10,000 of those were destroyed" [...] while compensation amounts to 20 percent of the value of damaged houses, with an estimated 32,000 homeowners eligible, according to Marine Lt Col William Brown. According to NBC, 9,000 homes were destroyed, thousands more were damaged and of the 32,000 compensation claims only 2,500 have been paid as of 14 April 2005.|$|R

5|$|USMC sources {{documented}} the Harrier as holding an 85 percent aircraft availability {{record in the}} Iraq War; in just under a month of combat, the aircraft flew over 2,000 sorties. When used, the LITENING II targeting pod achieved greater than 75 percent kill effectiveness on targets. In a single sortie from USS Bonhomme Richard, a wave of Harriers inflicted heavy damage on a Republican Guard tank battalion in advance of a major ground assault on Al Kut. Harriers regularly operated in close support roles for friendly tanks, one of the aircraft generally carrying a LITENING pod. Despite the Harrier's high marks, the limited {{amount of time that}} each aircraft could remain on station, around 15–20 minutes, led to some calls from within the USMC for the procurement of AC-130 gunships, which could loiter for six hours and had a heavier close air support capability than the AV-8B. AV-8Bs were later used in combination with artillery to provide constant fire support for ground forces during heavy fighting in 2004 around the insurgent stronghold <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah.</b> The urban environment there required extreme precision for airstrikes.|$|E

Weemer had contacted Hackett two years earlier after he had successfully represented other Marines charged with violations {{of the law of}} war in Haditha in November 2005. Hackett represented Weemer pro bono. When asked why, Hackett stated that [...] "these Marines protected me when I was in Fallujah, it's the least I could do." [...] The trial lasted two weeks after which the 8 member court martial deliberated for 8 hours and announced its decision acquitting Weemer of all charges and specifications, to unpremeditated murder and dereliction of duty.|$|R
25|$|On February 1, the Iraqi Army {{launched}} an offensive on the Khalidiya Island area, {{which is the}} region located between the villages Albu Nasir and Albu Shajal, situated between Ramadi and Fallujah. On the same day, the Iraqi Army managed to capture the villages of Albu Shalib and Albu Shajal, to the northwest <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah.</b> On February 2, the Iraqi Army fully severed the last supply lines between the Khalidiya Island region and the city <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah,</b> completely besieging the city. This led to concerns that an estimated 30,000 civilians trapped in Fallujah would starve, {{due to the lack}} of airdropped supplies into the city. On February 4, after Ramadi city was recaptured from ISIL, offensive operations shifted further eastward to the Khalidiya Island area.|$|E
25|$|On February 18, a {{large number}} of local Sunni tribesmen revolted against ISIL, after ISIL beat a woman, among other {{restrictive}} practices enforces by ISIL's Al-Hisbah secret police, amid an ongoing siege. ISIL was reported to have withdrawn into Fallujah city, after local Sunnis burned the Al-Hisbah headquarters and clashes spread. On February 20, the clashes began to die down as ISIL began carrying out mass arrests, and it was reported that there were still some Sunni fighters who were pinned down in parts <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah,</b> who would likely be massacred if the Iraqi Government or the US-led Coalition does not intervene. On February 21, the Iraqi Army began shelling ISIL positions on the outskirts <b>of</b> <b>Fallujah,</b> in support of the Sunni tribal fighters. Late on February 21, ISIL crushed the revolt, and detained 180 men. However, on the same day, the Iraqi Army deployed reinforcements to Fallujah, in preparation to storm the city.|$|E
