30|$|The study <b>of</b> {{economic}} <b>dispatch</b> {{dates back}} to the 1920 s. The spatial and temporal distribution variation of load demand is the prime cause <b>of</b> economic <b>dispatch.</b> The goal <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> is the advanced decision-making for base-point generations of units and configuration of spinning reserves based on load forecast. From classical economic dispatch centering on the concepts of incremental cost, incremental loss and hydro-coal conversion equivalent in the mid and late of 1950 s [1], to the optimal power flow considering network security in the 1960 s [2], thence to the theories <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> and control which emphasizing the coordination <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> and automatic generation control (AGC) in the 1980 s [3, 4], the study <b>of</b> economic <b>dispatch</b> has been relatively mature in theory and practice.|$|R

40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} and solved which captures {{the essence of the}} concept <b>of</b> mobile <b>dispatch</b> service. There are two types <b>of</b> users, <b>dispatch</b> and interconnect (calls routed from the public switched telephone network, of much longer holding times). Also, only some of the available repeaters can be used for interconnect traffic, and blocked interconnect calls are cleared. Dispatch calls, however, can access all repeaters, and then are queued if all repeaters are busy. One design decision involves a trade between blocking of interconnect calls and queueing <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> calls. A formula has been derived for both interconnect blocking probability and the mean dispatch queueing time to permit this trade. The results indicate that a good operating point is to have (N - a_d) (rounded down) interconnected repeaters, where there are N total repeaters and a_d Erlangs <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> traffic...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. This {{scientific}} work considers the {{further development of}} mathematical models and algorithms for automatic decision support for <b>dispatching</b> management <b>of</b> the city passenger traffic. Methodology. Systems <b>of</b> <b>dispatching</b> management for the city passenger transport are to provide the carrying out of the routes according schedules with minimal deviations from the planned ones through the using of appropriate control actions. The systems’ algorithm focuses on the selection of control actions that compensate the disturbances. It is proposed to use the index of the waiting time minimum for passengers of buses and taxis at stops as a criterion for evaluating <b>of</b> <b>dispatching</b> control systems work. Findings. Based on the conducted analysis of the research within the existing theory of traffic flow of vehicles, it was proposed {{the model for the}} system <b>of</b> <b>dispatching</b> management for urban passenger moving units considering the effect of the most important stochastic factors on the schedule of buses and taxis movement in large cities. The obtained system of equations that models the parameter of movement on the bus routes allows you to assess quickly the influence of disturbing effects on the service quality indicators of passengers and, if necessary, to draw up the optimal schedule. Originality. The authors propose a new model for decision support <b>of</b> <b>dispatching</b> management for the city passenger transport. They take into account the effect of the most important stochastic factors, such as the overflowing buses and taxis, their descent from the lines, delays, deviations from the speed limit on the route, etc., on indicators of service quality, as well as optimizing the schedule. Practical value. The results allow to improve approaches to building models using in the systems <b>of</b> <b>dispatching</b> management <b>of</b> urban bus routes, as well as to improve the selection of control actions for similar systems in large cities of Ukraine...|$|R
