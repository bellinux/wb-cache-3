5|$|By July 27, the FEAF Bomber Command had a {{comprehensive}} rail interdiction plan ready. This plan sought {{to cut the}} flow of North Korean troops and materiel from North Korea to the combat area. Two cut points, the P'yong-yang railroad bridge and marshaling yards and the Hamhung bridge and Hamhung and Wonsan marshaling yards would almost completely sever North Korea's rail logistics network. Destruction of the rail bridges over the Han near Seoul would cut rail communication to the Pusan Perimeter area. On July 28 the Far East Air Forces gave a list <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> in the rail interdiction program to the Bomber Command, and two days later a similar plan was ready for interdiction of highways. On August 3, the FEAF issued lists <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> for coordinated interdiction attacks south of the 38th Parallel to the Fifth Air Force and to the Navy. In general, the Han River divided the Fifth Air Force and FEAF Bomber Command zones.|$|E

In September 1951 Belfast provided anti-aircraft cover for a salvage operation to recover a crashed enemy MiG-15 jet fighter.

40|$|Abstract This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} occurrence and use <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing in New Zealand Private Training Establishments (PTEs) and examines the level <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing (TC) implementations in different TC PTEs. I {{find that there}} is a relatively moderate adoption rate <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing (33. 3 per cent) in the PTE sector in New Zealand. More than half of these PTEs, which adopted target costing (referred as TC PTEs), have only a basic level <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing implementation. This dissertation also identifies factors that contribute to a more complete implementation <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing in PTEs, by empirically examining the association between eight identified factors and the completeness <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing implementation. Five management techniques/tools (factors) {{have been found to be}} significantly associated with the completeness <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing implementation: 1) top management support in the implementation <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing; 2) cross-functional teams; 3) a structural reporting system; 4) performance rewards based on achievement <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costs; and 5) active participation of suppliers and other external stakeholders in the program development. This suggests PTEs with a higher level <b>of</b> <b>target</b> cost implementation are more likely to adopt these techniques/tools. This research also empirically examines the effect <b>of</b> the <b>target</b> costing adoption on cost reduction performance, quality level of services, and customer satisfaction level in the PTE context, as well as the impact <b>of</b> completeness <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing implementation on these three aspects. The findings from this study suggest that the adoption <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing has positive influences on cost reduction performance and quality level of services in PTEs. Moreover, the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing in reducing cost also increases when the TC PTEs have a more complete target costing implementation...|$|R

5|$|The campaign's {{ultimate}} limitation was {{the poor}} formulation of military strategy.

The illuminated reticle was eventually replaced by a video screen at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics that not only gave a sighting point and information from a lead-finding computer and radar, but also various aircraft indicators (such as an artificial horizon, compass, altitude and airspeed indicators), facilitating the visual tracking <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> or the transition from instrument to visual methods during landings.|$|E
5|$|As {{the project}} neared its conclusion, American {{planners}} began {{to consider the}} use of the bomb. Groves formed a committee that met in April and May 1945 to draw up a list <b>of</b> <b>targets.</b> One of the primary criteria was that the target cities must not have been damaged by conventional bombing. This would allow for an accurate assessment of the damage done by the atomic bomb. The targeting committee's list included 18 Japanese cities. At {{the top of the list}} were Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Kokura, and Niigata. Ultimately, Kyoto was removed from the list at the insistence of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who had visited the city on his honeymoon and knew of its cultural and historical significance.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preparation}} for D-Day {{in the spring}} of 1944, the Allies launched the Transport Plan, carrying out intensive bombing of railway junctions and transport networks across northern France and Belgium. Many of these targets were in towns near densely populated civilian areas, such as La Louvière and Kortrijk in Belgium, which were bombed in March 1944. The phase of bombing in the lead up to D-Day alone resulted in 1,500 civilian casualties. Bombing <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> in Belgium steadily increased as the Allies advanced westward across France. Allied bombing during the liberation in September 1944 killed 9,750 Belgians and injured 40,000.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the first {{research}} to examine the determinants of the accuracy <b>of</b> the <b>target</b> prices <b>of</b> sell-side analysts within a relative context. This is achieved by utilising a within analyst rank-correlation <b>of</b> <b>target</b> price expected returns and realised price returns, which measures whether analysts can accurately rank the price appreciation of stocks within their coverage cluster. The study then investigates whether the factors that determine the absolute accuracy <b>of</b> <b>target</b> prices also explain the relative accuracy <b>of</b> <b>target</b> prices. The evidence suggests {{that many of the}} determinants of the absolute accuracy <b>of</b> <b>target</b> prices are not necessarily determinants of the relative accuracy <b>of</b> <b>target</b> prices, providing a more nuanced understanding of their association with analyst forecasts. This thesis is also the first research to examine discordance between analysts’ recommendations and target price expected returns at an individual analyst level, documenting similar discordance to that found in prior research at a consensus level...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 15 years, {{microbial}} source tracking (MST) methods {{have emerged as}} a management tool for water quality authorities to identify the sources of faecal contamination in receiving waters. The majority of the MST methods require {{the development of a}} library <b>of</b> <b>target</b> strains or faecal indicator bacteria from suspected sources by using various genotypic or phenotypic methods. Phenotypic or genotypic patterns <b>of</b> <b>target</b> strains are then compared to the library to identify their likely sources. None of these library-dependent methods are regarded as a 'gold standard'. Significant limitations include the size and representativeness of the developed library, temporal and geographical stability <b>of</b> <b>target</b> strains, host specificity <b>of</b> <b>target</b> strains, relative persistence <b>of</b> <b>target</b> strains in receiving waters and differences in statistical methods used.

5|$|In {{the final}} days of August 1995, NATO {{launched}} Operation Deliberate Force—an air campaign targeting the VRS. This campaign was launched in response to the second Markale massacre of 28 August, which came {{on the heels of the}} Srebrenica massacre. Airstrikes began on 30 August, initially targeting VRS air defences, and striking targets near Sarajevo. The campaign was briefly suspended on 1 September and its scope was expanded to target artillery and storage facilities around the city. The bombing resumed on 5 September, and its scope extended to VRS air defences near Banja Luka by 9 September as NATO had nearly exhausted its list <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> near Sarajevo. On 13 September, the Bosnian Serbs accepted NATO's demand for the establishment of an exclusion zone around Sarajevo and the campaign ceased.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, one {{improvement}} to Zeus {{was already}} being studied: a new phased-array radar replacing Zeus' mechanical ones would greatly {{increase the number}} <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> and interceptors that a single site could handle. Much more powerful computers were needed to match this performance. Additionally, the antennas were mounted directly in concrete and would have increased blast resistance. Initial studies at Bell Labs started in 1960 on what was then known as the Zeus Multi-function Array Radar, or ZMAR. In June 1961, Western Electric and Sylvania were selected to build a prototype, with Sperry Rand Univac providing the control computer.|$|E
30|$|An {{important}} {{performance measure}} for target tracking in clutter is the track management.
