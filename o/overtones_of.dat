5|$|Laurence Olivier's 1948 moody {{black-and-white}} Hamlet won Best Picture and Best Actor Oscars, and is still, , {{the only}} Shakespeare film {{to have done}} so. His interpretation stressed the Oedipal <b>overtones</b> <b>of</b> the play, and cast 28-year-old Eileen Herlie as Hamlet's mother, opposite himself, at 41, as Hamlet.|$|E
5|$|Dracula's Daughter {{was not as}} {{successful}} as the original upon its release, although it was generally critically well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, criticism has been deeply divided. Modern critics and scholars have noted the strong lesbian <b>overtones</b> <b>of</b> the film, which Universal acknowledged {{from the start of}} filming and exploited in some early advertising.|$|E
5|$|Heyer {{specialised}} in {{two types}} of romantic male leads, which she called Mark I and Mark II. Mark I, with <b>overtones</b> <b>of</b> Mr Rochester, was (in her words) “rude, overbearing, and often a bounder”. Mark II by contrast was debonair, sophisticated, and often a style-icon. Similarly, her heroines (reflecting Austen's division between lively and gentle) fell into two broad groups: the tall and dashing, mannish type, and the quiet bullied type.|$|E
50|$|String {{resonance}} {{occurs on}} string instruments. Strings {{or parts of}} strings may resonate at their fundamental or overtone frequencies when other strings are sounded. For example, an A string at 440 Hz will cause an E string at 330 Hz to resonate, because they share an <b>overtone</b> <b>of</b> 1320 Hz (3rd <b>overtone</b> <b>of</b> A and 4th <b>overtone</b> <b>of</b> E).|$|R
50|$|Strings {{or parts}} of strings may {{resonate}} at their fundamental or harmonic frequencies when other strings are sounded. In general, non-played strings respond in sympathy to other strings being played. Two tones of the same pitch will give maximum sympathetic resonance as all harmonics of both strings will overlap. Other harmonic combinations will cause sympathetic resonance at the fifth, fourth and major third. For example, an A string at 440 Hz will cause an E string at 330 Hz to resonate, because they share an <b>overtone</b> <b>of</b> 1320 Hz (third <b>overtone</b> <b>of</b> A and fourth <b>overtone</b> <b>of</b> E).|$|R

5|$|The Reformation brought {{changes in}} outlook and artistic {{expression}} as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes. Sacred imagery {{was shown in}} a didactic and moralistic manner, with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated to the background. Pieter Bruegel the Elder, {{one of the few}} who followed Bosch's style, is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors. His work retains many 15th-century conventions, but his perspective and subjects are distinctly modern. Sweeping landscapes came to the fore in paintings that were provisionally religious or mythological, and his genre scenes were complex, with <b>overtones</b> <b>of</b> religious skepticism and even hints of nationalism.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century botany {{was one of}} the few {{sciences}} considered {{appropriate for}} genteel educated women. Around 1760, with the popularization of the Linnaean system, botany became much more widespread among educated women who painted plants, attended classes on plant classification, and collected herbarium specimens although emphasis was on the healing properties of plants rather than plant reproduction which had <b>overtones</b> <b>of</b> sexuality. Women began publishing on botanical topics and children's books on botany appeared by authors like Charlotte Turner Smith. Cultural authorities argued that education through botany created culturally and scientifically aware citizens, part of the thrust for 'improvement' that characterised the Enlightenment. However, in the early 19th century with the recognition of botany as an official science women were again excluded from the discipline.|$|E
5|$|Back in 1866, as the {{composer}} of The Brandenburgers with its <b>overtones</b> <b>of</b> German military aggression, Smetana {{thought he might}} be targeted by the invading Prussians, so he absented himself from Prague until hostilities ceased. He returned in September, and almost immediately achieved a long-standing ambition—appointment as principal conductor of the Provisional Theatre, at an annual salary of 1,200gulden. In the absence of a body of suitable Czech opera, Smetana in his first season presented standard works by Weber, Mozart, Donizetti, Rossini and Glinka, with a revival of his own Bartered Bride. The quality of Smetana's production of Glinka's A Life for the Tsar angered Glinka's champion Mily Balakirev, who expressed himself forcefully. This caused prolonged hostility between the two men. On 16May 1868 Smetana, representing Czech musicians, helped to lay the foundation stone for the future National Theatre; he had written a Festive Overture for the occasion. That same evening Smetana's third opera, Dalibor, was premièred at Prague's New Town Theatre. Although its initial reception was warm its reviews were poor, and Smetana resigned himself to its failure.|$|E
25|$|Beating {{can also}} be heard between notes that are near to, but not exactly, a {{harmonic}} interval, due to some harmonic of the first note beating with a harmonic of the second note. For example, {{in the case of}} perfect fifth, the third harmonic (i.e. second <b>overtone)</b> <b>of</b> the bass note beats with the second harmonic (first <b>overtone)</b> <b>of</b> the other note. As well as with out-of tune notes, this can also happen with some correctly tuned equal temperament intervals, because of the differences between them and the corresponding just intonation intervals: see Harmonic series (music)#Harmonics and tuning.|$|R
5000|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>overtones</b> {{involves}} fingering {{one note}} but altering the air stream to produce another note {{which is an}} <b>overtone</b> <b>of</b> the fingered note. For example, if low B♭ is fingered, a B♭ one octave above may be sounded by manipulating the air stream. Other overtones that can be obtained with this fingering include F, B♭, and D. The practice <b>of</b> <b>overtones</b> is often used as a preliminary exercise for students learning to produce notes above high F# (the [...] "altissimo register").|$|R
40|$|The isoscalar giant dipole {{resonance}} (ISGDR), {{which is the}} lowest-energy <b>overtone</b> mode <b>of</b> the isoscalar giant resonances, has been studied in some medium-heavy and heavy nuclei in coincidence measurements.

5|$|The Johnson County War, {{with its}} <b>overtones</b> <b>of</b> class warfare {{coupled with the}} {{intervention}} ordered by the President of the United States to {{save the lives of}} a gang of hired killers and set them free, is not a flattering reflection on the American myth of the west. The Johnson County War {{has been one of the}} best-known range wars of the frontier. It has been a popular feature of the Western genre of fiction, which includes literature, films and television shows. The Banditti of the Plains, written in 1894 by witness Asa Shinn Mercer, is the earliest record of the Johnson County War. The book was suppressed for many years by the WSGA, who seized and destroyed all but a few of the first edition copies from the 1894 printing; they were rumored to have hijacked and destroyed the second printing as it was being shipped from a printer north of Denver, Colorado. The book was reprinted several times in the 20th century and most recently in 2015. Frances McElrath's novel 1902 The Rustler, took inspiration from the Johnson County War, and was sympathetic to the perspective of the small ranchers.|$|E

5000|$|High {{resolution}} IR {{spectra of}} most ketones {{reveal that the}} [...] "carbonyl band" [...] is split into a doublet. The peak separation is usually only a few cm−1. This splitting arises from the mixing of νCO and the <b>overtone</b> <b>of</b> HCH bending modes.|$|R

25|$|The {{movement}} was {{an outgrowth of}} jazz, and similarities with gypsy jazz are often noted. The music is an amalgamation of rural, cowboy, polka, folk, Dixieland jazz and blues blended with swing; and played by a hot string band often augmented with drums, saxophones, pianos and, notably, the steel guitar. The electrically amplified stringed instruments, especially the steel guitar, give the music a distinctive sound. Later incarnations have also included <b>overtones</b> <b>of</b> bebop.|$|E
25|$|The answer {{assumes a}} third level on which The Old Man and the Sea must be read—as {{a sort of}} allegorical {{commentary}} on all his previous work, by means of which it may be established that the religious <b>overtones</b> <b>of</b> The Old Man and the Sea are not peculiar to that book among Hemingway's works, and that Hemingway has finally taken the decisive step in elevating {{what might be called}} his philosophy of Manhood {{to the level of a}} religion.|$|E
25|$|The C–C–G–C–E–G tuning uses {{some of the}} {{harmonic}} sequence (<b>overtones)</b> <b>of</b> the note C. When an open-note C-string is struck, its harmonic sequence begins with the notes C, C, G, C, E, G, B, C. This overtone-series tuning was modified by Mick Ralphs, who used a high C rather than the high G for “Can’t Get Enough” on Bad Company. Ralphs said, “It needs the open C to have that ring,” and “it never really sounds right in standard tuning”. Ralphs wrote these songs in the key of G on a guitar in Open-G tuning.|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} a molecular system {{where it is}} possible to effectively control the interconversion between two different stable conformational states, using selective narrow-band near-infrared irradiation. Monomers of hydroxyacetone (HA) isolated in low temperature argon matrices at 15 K exist exclusively in the conformational ground state Cc. Narrow-band near-infrared vibrational excitation of the first OH stretching <b>overtone</b> <b>of</b> the Cc form resulted in conformational isomerization. The photoproduct was identified as the higher energy Tt conformer of HA, and it was found to be stable at 15 K. The reverse isomerization, converting Tt into Cc, could also be induced by laser excitation of the first OH stretching <b>overtone</b> <b>of</b> the Tt form. The interpretation of the experimental observations was supported by anharmonic and harmonic calculations of the vibrational spectra and barriers to intramolecular rotation...|$|R
40|$|The {{changes in}} the spectra of the acidic group in chabazite are studied by quantum chem. calcns. The zeolite is modeled by two {{clusters}} consisting of eight tetrahedral atoms arranged in a ring and seven tetrahedral atoms coordinated around the zeolite OH group. The potential energy and dipole surfaces were constructed from the zeolite OH stretch, in-plane and out-of-plane bending coordinates, and the intermol. stretch coordinate that corresponds to a movement of the water mol. as a whole. Both the anharmonicities of the potential energy and dipole were taken into account by calcn. of the frequencies and intensities. The matrix elements of the vibrational Hamiltonian were calcd. within the discrete variable representation basis set. We have assigned the exptl. obsd. frequencies at. apprx. 2900,. apprx. 2400, and. apprx. 1700 cm- 1 to the strongly perturbed zeolite OH vibrations caused by the hydrogen bonding with the water mol. The ABC triplet is a Fermi resonance of the zeolite OH stretch mode with the <b>overtone</b> <b>of</b> the in-plane bending (the A band) and the <b>overtone</b> <b>of</b> the out-of-plane bending (the C band). In the B band the stretch is also coupled with the second <b>overtone</b> <b>of</b> the out-of-plane bending.

25|$|Mihiko Shimizu, {{original}} {{inventor of}} the festival, and other Issei business owners vied for an alliance with the Nisei run Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) to promote the festival. However, {{the possibility of being}} labelled as anti-American by anti-Japanese groups remained a concern, due to the collaboration of the two generations (American citizens and Japanese nationals) and cultural <b>overtones</b> <b>of</b> the festival. The Issei business owners decided to hand over all aspects of the celebration to the independent JACL to settle the problem. The first festival was held August 13, 1934, founded by the JACL.|$|E
25|$|The lateral cut NAB curve {{was remarkably}} similar to the NBC Orthacoustic curve that evolved from {{practices}} within the National Broadcasting Company since the mid-1930s. Empirically, and not by any formula, it was learned that the bass end of the audio spectrum below 100Hz could be boosted somewhat to override system hum and turntable rumble noises. Likewise at the treble end beginning at 1,000Hz, if audio frequencies were boosted by 16dB at 10,000Hz the delicate sibilant sounds of speech and high <b>overtones</b> <b>of</b> musical instruments could survive the noise level of cellulose acetate, lacquer–aluminum, and vinyl disc media. When the record was played back using a complementary inverse curve, signal-to-noise ratio was improved and the programming sounded more lifelike.|$|E
25|$|The drum {{head has}} the most effect on how a drum sounds. Each type of drum head serves its own musical purpose and has its own unique sound. Double-ply drumheads dampen high {{frequency}} harmonics because they are heavier and they are suited to heavy playing. Drum heads with a white, textured coating on them muffle the <b>overtones</b> <b>of</b> the drum head slightly, producing a less diverse pitch. Drum heads with central silver or black dots tend to muffle the overtones even more. And drum heads with perimeter sound rings mostly eliminate overtones (Howie 2005). Some jazz drummers avoid using thick drum heads, preferring single ply drum heads or drum heads with no muffling. Rock drummers often prefer the thicker or coated drum heads.|$|E

25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note the similarities and differences in the experiences of the Whiteoak family and de la Roche's. While the lives and successes of the Whiteoaks rise and fall, there remained for them the steadiness of the family manor, known as Jalna. De la Roche's family endured the illness of her mother, the perpetual job searches of her father, and the adoption of her orphaned cousin while being moved 17 times. Several critics believe that Finch Whiteoak who majors in Finch's Fortune (1932) is a reflection of de la Roche herself. He was a somewhat tortured concert pianist with <b>overtones</b> <b>of</b> gayness. The names of many of the characters were taken from gravestones in a Newmarket, Ontario cemetery.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} an {{intention}} to give {{the overthrow of the}} monarchy <b>overtones</b> <b>of</b> unification, nationalism and being above the particular interests of individual social classes. This panacea that would cure, once and for all, all the ills of the nation, elevating it to glory, emphasised two fundamental tendencies: nationalism and colonialism. From this combination came the final desertion of Iberian Federalism, patent in the first republican theses by José Félix Henriques Nogueira, identifying the monarchy as antipatriotism and the yielding to foreign interests. Another strong component of republican ideology was emphasised by anti-clericalism, due to the theorisation of Teófilo Braga, who identified religion as an obstacle to progress and responsible for the scientific retardation of Portugal, in opposition to republicanism, which was linked by him to science, progress and well-being.|$|E
25|$|The human {{target is}} the {{essential}} distinguishing feature of the impalement arts. It has been asserted by several sources, including well-known knife throwers, that the power and appeal {{of this type of}} act lies as much in audience appreciation of the target as in admiration of the skill of the thrower or archer. Various theories have been put forward to explain this, ranging from simple awe at the display of steely nerves and complete trust to more complex psychological and philosophical theories. While some point to <b>overtones</b> <b>of</b> sadomasochistic eroticism, others cite dramaturgical works and point to parallels with the story arc of the hero in classic drama.
