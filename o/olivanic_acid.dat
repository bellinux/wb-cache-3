40|$|The {{interactions}} between three class A beta-lactamases and three beta-lactamase inactivators (clavulanic acid, sulbactam and <b>olivanic</b> <b>acid</b> MM 13902) were studied. Interestingly, {{the interaction between}} the Streptomyces cacaoi beta-lactamase and clavulanate indicated little irreversible inactivation. With sulbactam, irreversible inactivation was found to occur with the three studied enzymes, but no evidence for transiently inactivated adducts was found. Irreversible inactivation of the S. albus G and S. cacaoi enzymes was particularly slow. With olivanate, irreversible inactivation was also observed with the three enzymes, but with the S. cacaoi enzyme, no hydrolysis could be detected. A tentative summary of the results found in the literature is also presented (including 6 beta-halogenopenicillanates), and the general conclusions underline the diversity of the mechanisms and the wide variations of the rate constants observed when class A beta-lactamases interact with beta-lactamase inactivators, in agreement with the behaviours of the same enzymes towards their good and poor substrates.

40|$|The carbapenems {{differ from}} the {{penicillins}} (penams) in having an unsaturatcd bond between C 2 and C 3 and a carbon atom replacing sulphur at position 1 of the thiazolidine ring. The various carbapenems differ primarily in {{the configuration of the}} side chains at C 2 and C 6. Carbapenems include the thienamycins, <b>olivanic</b> <b>acids,</b> carpetimycins, asparenomycins, pluracidomycins, and other natural and semi-syn-thetic compounds. Carbapenems vary in their stability and resistance to /Macta-mases, ability to inhibit and to induce /J-lactamases, and in-vitro spectra of activity. Many are highly unstable in solution. Some are degraded by mammalian dehydro-peptidases in viva. The hydroxyethyl side chain in the a or trans-configuration at C 6 in thienamycin provides striking resistance to /J-lactamases, but this compound is highly unstable in concentrated solution and the solid state. The Ar-formimidoyl derivative of thienamycin (imipenem) is more stable in solution and has broad-spectrum activity against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. However, imipenem is not stable to renal dehydropeptidases and its degradation products are nephrotoxic in certain animals. It is thus administered with the dehydropeptidase inhibitor cilas...|$|R
40|$|Thienamycin (THM), the N-formimidoyl {{thienamycin}} derivative MK 0787, {{and related}} carbapenem antibiotics were metabolized extensively in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, rhesus monkeys, and chimpanzees. Urinary recovery of THM {{ranged from a}} low of 5 % in dogs to 58 % in rhesus monkeys. Renal clearance rates in dogs and chimpanzees were unusually low, less than glomerular filtration rates. The reduction in clearance of THM and MK 0787 from plasma of rats and rabbits after ligation of renal arteries indicate that the kidneys are responsible for 35 and 92 %, respectively, of metabolic drug clearance. Degradation was detected only in kidney homogenates. The enzyme activity was membrane bound and sensitive to inhibitors of Zn-metalloenzymes such as EDTA. A renal dipeptidase, dehydropeptidase-I (DHP-I), EC 3. 4. 13. 11, was found to be responsible for the metabolism of the THM-class antibiotics, which exhibit a structural homology to dehydropeptides. A parallel increase in specific activity against THM and the substrate of DHP-I, glycyldehydrophenylalanine, was observed during solubilization and purification of the enzyme from porcine and human renal cortex. DHP-I was found to catalyze the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring in THM and MK 0787. The products of the enzyme reaction were identical by high-powered liquid chromatography to their respective metabolites found in the urine. Nonbasic N-acylated THM and natural N-acylated carbapenems (epithienamycins and <b>olivanic</b> <b>acids)</b> were degraded 4 - to 50 -fold faster than THM when exposed to the enzymatic hydrolysis of DHP-I. Good correlations were obtained between the increased susceptibility of the carbapenem antibiotics to DHP-I as measured in the in vitro enzyme assay and the generally lower recoveries of active antibiotic in the urine of test animals. Despite this unusual degree of metabolism localized in the kidney, the plasma half-life of MK 0787 and its efficacy against experimental systemic infections in animals remain satisfactory...|$|R
