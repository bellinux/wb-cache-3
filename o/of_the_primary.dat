5|$|The {{evolution}} of moon systems {{is driven by}} tidal forces.

In this situation, angular momentum is transferred from the rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> to the r{{evolution of}} the satellite.

40|$|We study <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> {{oblateness}} up to J_ 4 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> and power-law density profile (PDP) on <b>the</b> linear stability <b>of</b> libration {{location of}} an infinitesimal mass within <b>the</b> framework <b>of</b> restricted three body problem (R 3 BP), {{by using a}} more realistic model in which a disc with PDP is rotating around <b>the</b> common center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system mass with perturbed mean motion. The existence and stability of triangular equilibrium points have been explored. It {{has been shown that}} triangular equilibrium points are stable for 0 <μ<μ_c and unstable for μ_c≤μ≤ 1 / 2, where μ_c denotes the critical mass parameter. We find that, the oblateness up to J_ 2 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> and <b>the</b> radiation reduces the stability range while the oblateness up to J_ 4 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> increases <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> stability both in the context where PDP is considered and ignored. The PDP has an effect of about ≈ 0. 01 reduction on <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> μ_c to Earth-Moon and Jupiter-Moons systems. We find that <b>the</b> comprehensive effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perturbations have a stabilizing proclivity. However, the oblateness up to J_ 2 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> and <b>the</b> radiation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> have tendency for instability, while coefficients up to J_ 4 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> have stability predisposition. In the limiting case c= 0, and also by setting appropriate parameter(s) to zero, our results are in excellent agreement with the ones obtained previously. Libration points play very important role in space mission and as a consequence, our results have a practical application in space dynamics and related areas. The model may be applied to study the navigation and stationkeeping operations of spacecraft (infinitesimal mass) around the Jupiter (more massive) -Callisto (less massive) system, where PDP account for <b>the</b> circumsolar ring <b>of</b> asteroidal dust, which has a cloud of dust permanently in its wake...|$|R
