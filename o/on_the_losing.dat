Although Burnett pitched decently in game two, the Braves won 4–2. The Phillies' season ended when Hamels, despite a quality start, was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> end of a 2–1 final score.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the English Civil War Lady Drake {{was joined}} at her Devon home, Ash House in the parish of Musbury, by her fourth {{daughter}} Elizabeth Drake and her husband Winston Churchill (1620–1688), a Royalist cavalry captain. Unlike his mother-in-law who had supported the Parliamentary cause, Winston had the misfortune of fighting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> side of the war – for which he, like so many other Cavaliers, was forced to compound; in his case £446 18s. Although Winston had paid off the fine by 1651, it had impoverished him. From this episode may derive the Churchill family motto: Fiel Pero Desdichado ("Faithful but Unfortunate").|$|E

5|$|Between 1912 and 1918, Bulgaria became {{involved}} in three consecutive conflicts—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> side {{as a result of}} its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories, at Doiran and Dobrich, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses, and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929 due to the effects of these wars, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{entered the}} 2000 college {{football}} season with hopes of following up its {{victory in the}} 2000 Sugar Bowl with another national championship. The Seminoles' regular-season performance differed slightly from 1999, as they lost a regular-season game to Miami, yet still appeared in a third consecutive national championship game: the 2001 Orange Bowl. Unlike in 2000, the Seminoles emerged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> side of a 132 score. Virginia Tech, like Florida State, had hoped to attend the national championship game again, but an injury to star quarterback Michael Vick caused the Hokies to lose a regular-season game at third-ranked Miami, eliminating them from national championship contention.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey and Maud's oldest granddaughter, Joan, married Roger Mortimer in 1301, giving Mortimer {{control of}} Ludlow Castle. Around 1320, Roger built the Great Chamber block {{alongside}} the existing Great Hall and Solar complex, copying what {{was becoming a}} popular tripartite design for domestic castle buildings in the 14th century; an additional building was also constructed by Roger on {{the location of the}} later Tudor Lodgings, and the Guardrobe Tower was added to the curtain wall. Between 1321 and 1322 Mortimer found himself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> side of the Despenser War and, after being imprisoned by Edward II, he escaped from the Tower of London in 1323 into exile.|$|E

5|$|Pitchers {{have been}} named Series MVP twenty-seven times; four of them were relief pitchers. Twelve of the first {{fourteen}} World Series MVPs were won by pitchers; from 1969 until 1986, the proportion of pitcher MVPs declined—Rollie Fingers (1974) and Bret Saberhagen (1985) {{were the only two}} pitchers to win the award in this period. From 1987 until 1991, all of the World Series MVPs were pitchers, and, since 1995, pitchers have won the award nine times. Bobby Richardson of the 1960 New York Yankees is the only player in World Series history to be named MVP despite being <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> team.|$|E

5|$|R.C. MacLeod {{wrote of}} another {{tradition}} which {{stated that the}} flag was waved at a battle in Waternish, in about 1580; and of another which told of how it was waved {{during a time when}} a cattle plague was raging, and that it stopped the murrain. R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that the flag would only have been waved twice, and so rejected the tradition of it being unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay—because the MacLeods were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> side! R.C. MacLeod also wondered if it had been waved in 1600, when the clan was in a desperate state in the midst of warring with the Macdonalds of Sleat.|$|E
5|$|Stan Collymore, Fowler's strike partner from 1995–97, {{said in his}} {{autobiography}} that Fowler was the best player he has ever played alongside. Fowler and Collymore {{were among the most}} prolific goal-scoring strike partnerships in England during the 1995–96 season. In the same season he scored twice in a 4–3 victory over Newcastle United, a match voted the best of the decade in a Premier League poll. The match helped prevent Newcastle from winning the league, but it was not enough for Liverpool to clinch the title; they finished third while Manchester United were crowned champions. Fowler also played in his first FA Cup final that season, but was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> side as Manchester United won 1–0.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to his {{performance}} in leading Florida State to the win, FSU quarterback Drew Weatherford was named the game's Most Valuable Player. Weatherford finished the game having completed 21of his 35passes for 225yards and onetouchdown. Weatherford would eventually finish the season with 3,180passing yards, the most ever recorded by a freshman quarterback in the ACC. On {{the opposite side of}} the ball, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick finished the game 26for 52with 335yards, oneinterception, and onetouchdown. Although Vick was slightly better statistically than Weatherford and the Hokies were more statistically successful on offense thanks to Vick, the Most Valuable Player award is not usually given to a player <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> team.|$|E

5|$|After a tag team match, {{which they}} lost, on the August 19 episode of SmackDown, Fox was {{attacked}} by Natalya, which provoked a feud between the two. She began acting as a face while wrestling alongside several different Divas to face Natalya and Beth Phoenix, collectively known as The Divas of Doom, in tag team matches, and also regularly competing against them in singles matches. As part of the storyline, Fox also prevented Natalya and Phoenix from attacking other Divas, including Kelly Kelly and AJ. The storyline continued sporadically throughout {{the first half of}} 2012, with Fox losing tag team and singles matches to Phoenix and Natalya. Fox spent the remainder of 2012 and early 2013 competing in sporadic matches, usually <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> side. In mid–2013, Fox appeared on the rebooted WWE NXT, entering a tournament to determine the inaugural NXT Women's Champion, where she defeated Bayley in the first round, but lost to Paige in the semi-finals.|$|E

Arsenal had conceded only three goals throughout the 1993–94 staging of the Cup Winners' Cup, and beat Italian side Parma by a single goal to win the final. The other Super Cup place went to Milan, winners of the 1993–94 UEFA Champions League. Milan defeated pre-match favourites Barcelona 4–0 in the final, a result which earnt the club their third top European honour in six years. Milan were appearing in the event for the fifth time; prior to the game against Arsenal, they had won the Super Cup in consecutive years (in 1989 and 1990), and were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> side twice (in 1973 and 1993).
