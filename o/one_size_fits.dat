500|$|After being {{released}} from his contractual obligations with Warner Bros. Records, Frank Zappa formed Zappa Records, a label distributed at that time by Phonogram Inc.. [...] He released the successful double album Sheik Yerbouti (1979, recorded 8/1977-2/1978), and began working {{on a series of}} songs for a follow-up album. The songs [...] "Joe's Garage" [...] and [...] "Catholic Girls" [...] were recorded with the intention that Zappa would release them as a single. Throughout the development of Joe's Garage, Zappa's band recorded lengthy jams which Zappa later formed into the album. [...] The album also continued the development of xenochrony, a technique Zappa also featured on <b>One</b> <b>Size</b> <b>Fits</b> All (1975), in which aspects of older live recordings were utilized to create new compositions by overdubbing them onto studio recordings, or alternatively, selecting a previously recorded solo and allowing drummer Vinnie Colaiuta to improvise a new drum performance, interacting with the previously recorded piece.|$|E
500|$|By 1973 the Bizarre and Straight labels were discontinued. In their place, Zappa and Cohen created DiscReet Records, also {{distributed}} by Warner Bros. Zappa continued {{a high rate}} of production through {{the first half of the}} 1970s, including the solo album Apostrophe (') (1974), which reached a career-high No.10 on the Billboard pop album charts helped by the chart single [...] "Don't Eat The Yellow Snow". Other albums from the period are Over-Nite Sensation (1973), which contained several future concert favorites, such as [...] "Dinah-Moe Humm" [...] and [...] "Montana", and the albums Roxy & Elsewhere (1974) and <b>One</b> <b>Size</b> <b>Fits</b> All (1975) which feature ever-changing versions of a band still called the Mothers, and are notable for the tight renditions of highly difficult jazz fusion songs in such pieces as [...] "Inca Roads", [...] "Echidna's Arf (Of You)" [...] and [...] "Be-Bop Tango (Of the Old Jazzmen's Church)". A live recording from 1974, You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2 (1988), captures [...] "the full spirit and excellence of the 1973–75 band". Zappa released Bongo Fury (1975), which featured a live recording at the Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin from a tour the same year that reunited him with Captain Beefheart for a brief period. They later became estranged for a period of years, but were in contact at the end of Zappa's life.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the fall}} of 1975 the band had {{completed}} their European tour, with further US dates in the New Year of 1976, supporting Zappa along with Dr. John. Van Vliet now found himself stuck {{in a web of}} contractual hang-ups. At this point Zappa had begun to extend a helping hand, with Vliet already having performed incognito as [...] "Rollin' Red" [...] on Zappa's <b>One</b> <b>Size</b> <b>Fits</b> All (1975) and then joining with him on the Bongo Fury album and its later support tour. Two Vliet-penned numbers on the Bongo Fury album are [...] "Sam with the Showing Scalp Flat Top" [...] and [...] "Man with the Woman Head". The form, texture and imagery of this album's first track, [...] "Debra Kadabra", sung by Vliet, has 'angular similarities' to the work he would later produce in his next three albums. On the Bongo Fury album Vliet also sings [...] "Poofter's Froth Wyoming Plans Ahead", harmonizes on [...] "200 Years Old" [...] and [...] "Muffin Man", and plays harmonica and soprano saxophone.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the causal relationships between trade liberalization {{growth of the}} Nigerian economy and poverty. This study applied time series data for Nigeria. We employed the recently introduced Pesaran et al (2001) ARDL approach. Evidence from the study suggest that trade liberalization does not cause poverty reduction, implying that the benefit of trade liberalization does not trickle down to the poor in Nigeria. This suggests that countries with high propensity to import and poor commodity prices need not to strictly follow the <b>one</b> <b>size</b> <b>fit</b> all trade liberalization policies rather each country {{need to focus on}} trade policies peculiar to its own environment, which can deliver growth and translate growth into a meaningful poverty reduction. </p...|$|R

40|$|Socialism in {{different}} countries has both common regularities and specific features. Individual participants in the seminar reevaluated "national" aspects of economic mechanisms.

Unity in the given instance is understood as objective commonness, as the coincidence of basic features. The freer the new systems are from dogmatism and errors, the closer they approach the ideal, the more powerfully are these features manifested. In this sense the advantage belongs to those who carry out reforms, who take the strong and weak sides of the pioneers into account, and who are able to bypass elementary and rudimentary structures. ...|$|R
