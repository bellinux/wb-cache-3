5000|$|Many Berean Christadelphians {{refer to}} John Thomas as 'Doctor Thomas' rather than 'Brother Thomas' (as male {{members of the}} Christadephians usually are).Please refer to online Berean Christadelphian {{archives}} for evidence of the Berean Christadelphian use of the phrase Brother Thomas, Bro. Thomas and <b>other</b> such <b>references</b> <b>number</b> in the thousands in the Berean Christadelphian magazine. Bereans doubt that the Bible alone is sufficient to teach the gospel, believing that the writings of either John Thomas or Robert Roberts are not only necessary but vital for a correct understanding of the Scriptures (considering the writings of John Thomas and Robert Roberts authoritative expositions of the Bible), and it is taught that neglect of the regular reading of these writings is 'to put our own salvation at risk!'. [...] Bereans are typically suspicious of interpreting the Bible {{without the aid of}} the writings of John Thomas and Robert Roberts. [...] The writings of John Thomas and Robert Roberts are considered authoritative expositions in the Berean fellowship, and Bereans will often quote them in discussion of Biblical issues instead of quoting the Bible.|$|R
5000|$|Eusebius to Carpianus {{his beloved}} {{brother in the}} Lord: greetings.Ammonius the Alexandrian, having exerted {{a great deal of}} energy and effort as was necessary, bequeaths to us a {{harmonized}} account of the four gospels. Alongside the Gospel according to Matthew, he placed the corresponding sections of the other gospels. But this had the inevitable result of ruining the sequential order of the other three gospels, as far as a continuous reading of the text was concerned. Keeping, however, both the body and sequence of the other gospels completely intact, in order that {{you may be able to}} know where each evangelist wrote passages in which they were led by love of truth to speak about the same things, I drew up a total of ten tables according to another system, acquiring the raw data from the work of the man mentioned above. These tables are set out for you below.The first of them lists the <b>reference</b> <b>numbers</b> for similar things recounted in the four gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; the second in the three, Matthew, Mark, and Luke; the third in the three, Matthew, Luke, and John; the fourth in the three, Matthew, Mark, and John; the fifth in the two, Matthew, and Luke; the sixth in the two, Matthew and Mark; the seventh in the two, Matthew and John; the eighth in the two, Mark and Luke; the ninth in the two, Luke and John; the tenth is for unique things recorded in each gospel.Now that I have outlined the structure of the tables set out below, I will explain how to use them. In each of the four gospels, consecutive <b>reference</b> <b>numbers</b> are assigned to each section, starting from the first, then the second, and the third, and so on in sequence, proceeding through the whole gospel to the book's end. Every <b>reference</b> <b>number</b> has a numeral written below it in red that indicates in which of the ten tables the <b>reference</b> <b>number</b> is located. If the red numeral is a I, the <b>reference</b> <b>number</b> is clearly in the first table, and if it is a II, in the second, and thus in sequence to the numeral ten.And so, suppose you open one of the four gospels at some point, wishing to go to a certain chapter in order to know what gospels recount similar things and to find in each gospel the related passages in which the evangelists were led to speak about the same things. By using the <b>reference</b> <b>number</b> assigned for the section in which you are interested and looking for it within the table indicated by the red numeral below it, you will immediately discover from the titles at the head of the table how many and which gospels recount similar things. By going to the <b>other</b> gospels' <b>reference</b> <b>numbers</b> that are in the same row as the <b>reference</b> <b>number</b> in the table you are at and looking them up in the related passages of each gospel, you will find similar things mentioned.|$|R

She flippantly discusses what exciting things she would wish to happen to her, mainly adventures involving German spies or spying trips to Bolshevik Russia. Their conversation is interrupted {{by the arrival of}} Mr Carter (see The Secret Adversary) who asks them to take over The International Detective Agency. The agency's manager, Theodore Blunt, is in prison. They are to undertake any of the normal cases the agency receives, whilst all the time watching for letters on blue paper sent to Mr Blunt from a supposed ham merchant anxious to trace his refugee wife. Each such letter will have a Russian stamp with a [...] "16" [...] written underneath. Tommy and Tuppence are to be alert for any <b>other</b> <b>reference</b> to the <b>number</b> sixteen.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} fifteen or twenty years {{mathematical}} models have proven an invaluable resource in the understanding and treatment {{of a wide variety}} of diseases. One of the most studied (and most difficult) cases is that of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Though a number of drugs have been approved for the treatment of HIV infection—most notably the reverse transciptase inhibitors 1, AZT (zidovudine, approved in 1987, one of the first), DDC (zalcitabine), DDI (didansoine), D 4 T (stavudine), and the protease inhibitors indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and 141 W 94 —none have proven generally effective for eradicating the virus. In fact, HIV evolves so rapidly, producing on average 10 10 viral particles (virions) per day, that effective treatment by any single drug is unlikely to be effective over a long period of time. For this reason, most current treatments rely on various combinations of drugs (surf, for example, the web site in reference [IAPAC]). Rather than establish optimal treatment strategies through clinical trial and error, researchers have relied in part (and when possible) on mathematical models that can suggest ranges of treatment with greater likelihoods of success. In this project, we will study the role mathematical models have played in understanding the dynamics of HIV infection and develop models of our own. 2 Biological Aspects The first step toward modeling a new phenomenon mathematically consists in learning as much as possible about the phenomenon. In this section, we will review a few concepts from biology, virology, and immunology that will be critical for the development of any reasonable model of HIV infection. Though I will try to give you what seem to be the most important points regarding HIV infection, you will need to consult at least a couple of <b>other</b> <b>references.</b> A <b>number</b> of specialized terms arise, so I’ve included a (highly abbreviated) glossary i...|$|R
40|$|Each {{time you}} cite or refer to someone else’s {{work in your}} paper you must {{identify}} the source with a <b>reference</b> <b>number.</b> These numbers appear in the reference list consecutively {{in the same order}} in which they appear in the text. Once a source has been cited, the same number is used in all subsequent references. No distinction is made between print and electronic references when citing within the text. Element The <b>reference</b> <b>number</b> appears in superscript after the full stop if it {{is at the end of}} a sentence, or after a comma if it is in the middle of a sentence. If you are citing the same source again, use the same <b>reference</b> <b>number.</b> If you have written about someone else’s ideas, you must use a <b>reference</b> <b>number,</b> even if you haven’t mentioned that person in your paper. Put the <b>reference</b> <b>number</b> after the relevant sentence or paragraph and cite their details in your reference list. When multiple references are cited at a given place in the text, use a hyphen to join the first and last numbers that are inclusive. Use commas (without spaces) to separate non‐sequential numbers. Use both commas and a hyphen for inclusive and non‐sequential references.
