[...] Shoes are almost invariably black and patent leather is considered more formal than matte finishes while pumps are considered more formal than lace-ups. Generally considered too informal for black tie are shoes with open lacing, such as the Derby shoe (bluchers in American English). Notable alternatives include the black button boot (primarily of historical interest only) and the monogrammed Albert slipper which was originally worn only at home. The black Gucci loafer in leather is also considered as an alternative, especially in urban British settings. Hosiery is black socks made from fine wool or silk.|$|E

50|$|In the {{earliest}} years of tap dancing, tap shoes often had wooden soles, but most tap shoes since have had leather soles. Today, {{it is common}} for manufacturers of tap shoes to also produce and fix taps. There are a variety of styles of shoe, the <b>Oxford</b> <b>shoe</b> being very common in jazz dance, and Mary Jane (shoe) is common for younger girls in tap classes.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>Oxford</b> <b>shoe</b> is {{characterized}} by shoelace eyelets tabs that are attached under the vamp, a feature termed [...] "closed lacing". This contrasts with Derbys, or Blüchers, which have shoelace eyelets attached {{to the top of}} the vamp. Originally, Oxfords were plain, formal shoes, made of leather but they evolved into a range of styles suitable for both formal, uniform, and casual wear. Based on function and the dictates of fashion, Oxfords are now made from a variety of materials, including calf leather, faux and genuine patent leather, suede, and canvas. They are normally black or brown, and may be plain or patterned (Brogue).|$|E

50|$|Women’s Oxford {{shoes are}} fashionable in the 2010s; however, this trend {{dates back to}} the 19th century. Borrowed from men’s {{footwear}} style, women’s Oxfords have received immense popularity since the 1920s including much attention in the 1940s-1950. The body of the <b>Oxford</b> <b>shoe</b> is created to appear as a flawless portion of leather, with a second leather piece forming the toe-cap. The differences in styles are generally due to the ornamentation: taller heels and designer colours. Since the current women’s oxfords draw ideas not only from the men’s shoe, but also from almost any conceivable source, the women’s variety has more freedom in terms of design, choice, and less adherence to tradition. This implies that Oxford shoes can fit almost every woman’s preferred style.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the punk fashion of the mid-late 1970s, there was {{a throwback to the}} late 1950s Ivy League style. This revival came to be definitively summarized in an enormously popular paperback released in 1980: The Official Preppy Handbook. Popular preppy clothing for men included Oxford shirts, sweaters, turtlenecks, polo shirts with popped collars, khaki slacks, argyle socks, dress pants, Hush Puppies <b>Oxford</b> <b>shoes,</b> brogues, suspenders, seersucker or striped linen suits, corduroy, and cable knit sweaters that were often worn tied around the shoulders.|$|R
40|$|Impact {{testing is}} {{undertaken}} {{to quantify the}} shock absorption characteristics of footwear. The current widely reported mechanical testing method mimics the heel impact in running and therefore applies excessive energy to walking footwear. The {{purpose of this study}} was to modify the ASTM protocol F 1614 (Procedure A) to better represent walking gait. This was achieved by collecting kinematic and kinetic data while participants walked in four different styles of walking footwear (trainer, <b>oxford</b> <b>shoe,</b> flip-flop and triple-density sandal). The quantified heel-velocity and effective mass at ground-impact were then replicated in a mechanical protocol. The kinematic data identified different impact characteristics in the footwear styles. Significantly faster heel velocity towards the floor was recorded walking in the toe-post sandals (flip-flop and triple-density sandal) compared with other conditions (e. g. flip-flop: 0. 36 ± 0. 05 m s− 1 versus trainer: 0. 18 ± 0. 06 m s− 1). The mechanical protocol was adapted by altering the mass and drop height specific to the data captured for each shoe (e. g. flip-flop: drop height 7 mm, mass 16. 2 kg). As expected, the adapted mechanical protocol produced significantly lower peak force and accelerometer values than the ASTM protocol (p <. 001). The mean difference between the human and adapted protocol was 12. 7 ± 17. 5 % (p <. 001) for peak acceleration and 25. 2 ± 17. 7 % (p =. 786) for peak force. This paper demonstrates that altered mechanical test protocols can more closely replicate loading on the lower limb in walking. This therefore suggests that testing of material properties of footbeds not only needs to be gait style specific (e. g. running versus walking), but also footwear style specific...|$|E

As justification, Salinger pointed to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy's completion of the march as proof of the fitness of the administration.

In addition to the kilt, the soldiers of the Camerons wear a leather sporran, and <b>oxford</b> <b>shoes</b> and Lovat hose with red garter flashes in lieu of ankle boots. Higher orders of dress include white spats, a white sporran (hair sporran for officers and senior NCOs), and a white belt.

5000|$|The current Speaker, John Bercow, {{no longer}} wears the {{traditional}} court dress outfit, which included knee breeches, silk stockings and buckled court shoes under the gown, or the wig.

As seen at the 2015 State Opening of Parliament, Bercow further toned down the state robe by removing the gold frogging on the sleeves and train, so that it now resembles a pro-chancellor's robe at certain universities. However, he returned to wearing the traditional robe in 2016.|$|R

Ribbons are worn above the left pocket of the shirt, with the warfare insignia above them. A nametag may be worn above the right pocket, and rank insignia is worn on the collar.
