5|$|Otto Warmbier, an American student {{held captive}} in North Korea for 17 months, was {{released}} to U.S. officials {{the same day}} as Rodman's visit to North Korea. Despite the timeline of the two events, the U.S. State Department, The White House, and Rodman all flatly denied any diplomatic connection or coordination between Rodman's visit and the U.S. government. The U.S. State Department said the release of Warmbier was negotiated and secured by high level U.S. diplomats including Joseph Yun, the State Department's special envoy <b>on</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea.</b> Warmbier who was in a nonresponsive coma throughout much of his imprisonment in North Korea, died days after being returned to his family in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Billie was {{the first}} typhoon officially {{monitored}} by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The storm brought floods to several East Asian countries in July1959. Billie developed from a tropical disturbance west of Kiribati on July12. Situated within favorable conditions, the system quickly reached tropical storm intensity before strengthening further to typhoon status a day after formation. Intensification continued until Billie reached its peak intensity on July14 east of Taiwan with maximum sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 970mbar (hPa; 28.64inHg). Slight weakening occurred before the typhoon made landfall on Zhejiang in China on July16. After tracking inland, Billie curved northward and moved over the Yellow Sea before making a final landfall <b>on</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> on July17; the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly afterwards before dissipating over the Sea of Japan a day later.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the formation of a Korean Economic Community could be a way to ease in unification of the Korean peninsula. Lee Myung-bak, departing from the Saenuri Party's traditional hardline stance, has outlined a comprehensive diplomatic package <b>on</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> that includes setting up a consultative body to discuss economic projects between the two Koreas.

25|$|In 2013, the LSE {{was caught}} in a furore over a BBC Panorama {{documentary}} <b>on</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea,</b> filmed inside the repressive regime by undercover journalists attached to a trip by the LSE's Grimshaw Society, a student society of the international relations department. The trip had been sanctioned by high-level North Korean officials. The trip caused international media attention, as a BBC journalist was posing as a part of LSE. There was debate as to where this put the student's lives in jeopardy in the repressive regime if a reporter had been exposed. The North Korea government made hostile threats towards the students and LSE, after the publicity, which forced an apology from the BBC.|$|E
25|$|During this time, North Korea's major {{allies were}} China, the USSR, and Cuba. While Fidel Castro and Cuba staunchly defended North Korea, both the USSR and China agreed to {{participate}} in the games. This major decision strained relationships that were vital to the North Korean economic system. Throughout the history of North Korea, North Korea relied heavily on the foreign aid. The countries that gave the most aid were the USSR and China. For that reason, the strained relationships had a major effect <b>on</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea.</b> This played a major role in the North Korean isolationist policies of the 1990s. In addition, as a result of the undeniable success of the Seoul Games, the growing gap between these two nations was further put on display.|$|E

MI6 had contacted the man who had inside information <b>on</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea's</b> nuclear programme, he considered the offer and wanted to arrange another meeting, but a year passed without MI6 hearing from him, which prompted them to request South African assistance when they learnt he would be travelling through South Africa.

25|$|The Secretariat of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification, Rodong Sinmun and the National Defense Commission have {{repeatedly}} condemned the South Korean government's policy <b>on</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea.</b> The state of North Korea holds {{the government of}} South Korea responsible for the balloon drops, and has demanded for harder actions against the activists. North Korea has also threatened military action. On 1 December 2012, the Secretariat issued a statement demanding then presidential candidate Park Geun-hye to terminate president Lee Myung-bak's policy and to fulfill her presidential election pledge. The Secretariat of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification warned that provokers will be held fully accountable and that the relations of the two states would be again pushed to a catastrophe {{in the event that}} the launch would be allowed to happen. Rodong Sinmun stated in October 2014 that the South Korean government's tolerance of the balloon launches is comparable to an act of war.|$|E

40|$|This study {{finds that}} <b>North</b> <b>Korea’s</b> nuclear {{test and the}} {{imposition}} of UN Security Council sanctions have had no perceptible effect <b>on</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea’s</b> trade with its two largest partners, China and South <b>Korea.</b> Before <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> conducted an underground nuclear test, it was widely believed that such an event would have cataclysmic diplomatic ramifications.

In retrospect, <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> may have calculated quite correctly that the direct penalties for establishing itself as a nuclear power would be modest (or, alternatively, put such a high value on demonstrating its nuclear capability that it outweighed the downside risks, however large). If sanctions are to deter behavior in the future, they will have to be much more enthusiastically implemented...|$|R
