5000|$|In operation, {{the light}} passes from a fibre array through the {{polarisation}} imaging optics which separates physically and aligns <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polarisation</b> {{states to be}} in the high efficiency s-polarisation state of the diffraction grating. The input light from a chosen fibre of the array is reflected from the imaging mirror and then angularly dispersed by the grating which is at near Littrow incidence, reflecting the light back to the imaging optics which directs each channel to a different portion of the LCoS. The path for each wavelength is then retraced upon reflection from the LCoS, with the beam-steering image applied on the LCOS directing the light to a particular port of the fibre array. As the wavelength channels are separated on the LCoS the switching of each wavelength is independent of all others and can be switched without interfering with the light on other channels. There are many different algorithms that can be implemented to achieve a given coupling between ports including less efficient [...] "images" [...] for attenuation or power splitting.|$|E
40|$|Long period {{gratings}} (LPGs) {{were written}} into a D-shaped optical fibre, {{which has an}} elliptical core with a W-shaped refractive index profile. The LPG's attenuation bands {{were found to be}} sensitive to the polarisation of the interrogating light with a spectral separation of about 15 nm between the two <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polarisation</b> states. In addition, two spectrally overlapping attenuation bands corresponding to <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polarisation</b> states were observed; modelling successfully reproduced this spectral feature. The spectral sensitivity of both orthogonal states was experimentally measured with respect to temperature, surrounding refractive index, and directional bending. These LPG devices produced blue and red wavelength shifts of the stop-bands due to bending in different directions. The measured spectral sensitivities to curvatures, d?/dR, ranged from - 3. 56 nm m to + 6. 51 nm m. The results obtained with these LPGs suggest that this type of fibre may be useful as a shape/bend sensor. It was also demonstrated that the neighbouring bands could be used to discriminate between temperature and bending and that overlapping <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polarisation</b> attenuation bands can be used to minimise error associated with polarisation...|$|E

SETTING: Academic Medical Centre. PARTICIPANTS: A group of 10 women with pre-eclampsia and a healthy control group of 10 pregnant women. METHODS: The microcirculation of the skin of the finger at rest and during venous occlusion was studied with laser Doppler fluxmetry and <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polarisation</b> spectral imaging. By inflating a cuff around the upper arm to a pressure of 50 mmHg, causing venous occlusion, the local sympathetic veno-arteriolar reflex was provoked. With laser Doppler fluxmetry the blood flow of the skin at a depth of 1 - 2 mm was measured at rest and during venous occlusion. <b>Orthogonal</b> <b>polarisation</b> spectral imaging was used to assess red blood cell velocity at rest and during venous occlusion of the nutritive capillaries of the skin. RESULTS: Laser Doppler fluxmetry showed {{no significant difference between the}} normotensive group and the group with pre-eclampsia. Using <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polarisation</b> spectral imaging, venous occlusion produced a significantly greater decrease in red blood cell velocity in the control group than in the women with pre-eclampsia: (84 % (81 - 88) (median and interquartile range) vs 58 % (45 - 88), P = 0. 0029). No differences in absolute red blood cell velocities were observed between groups either at rest or during venous occlusion.

40|$|Tumour {{angiogenesis}} plays a {{key role}} in tumour growth, formation of metastasis, detection and treatment of malignant tumours. Recent investigations provided increasing evidence that quantitative analysis of tumour angiogenesis is an indispensable prerequisite for developing novel treatment strategies such as anti-angiogenic and antivascular treatment options. Therefore, it was our aim to establish and validate a new and versatile imaging technique, that is <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polarisation</b> spectral™ imaging, allowing for non-invasive quantitative imaging of tumour angiogenesis in vivo. Experiments were performed in amelanotic melanoma A-MEL 3 implanted in a transparent dorsal skinfold chamber of the hamster. Starting at day 0 after tumour cell implantation, animals were treated daily with the anti-angiogenic compound SU 5416 (25 [*]mg[*]kg bw− 1) or vehicle (control) only. Functional vessel density, diameter of microvessels and red blood cell velocity were visualised by both <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polarisation</b> spectral™ imaging and fluorescence microscopy and analysed using a digital image system. The morphological and functional properties of the tumour microvasculature could be clearly identified by <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polarisation</b> spectral™ imaging. Data for functional vessel density correlated excellently with data obtained by fluroescence microscopy (y= 0. 99 x+ 0. 48, r 2 = 0. 97, RS= 0. 98, precision: 8. 22 [*]cm− 1 and bias: − 0. 32 [*]cm− 1). Correlation parameters for diameter of microvessels and red blood cell velocity were similar (r 2 = 0. 97, RS= 0. 99 and r 2 = 0. 93, RS= 0. 94 for diameter of microvessels and red blood cell velocity, respectively). Treatment with SU 5416 reduced tumour angiogenesis. At day 3 and 6 after tumour cell implantation, respectively, functional vessel density was 4. 8 ± 2. 1 and 87. 2 ± 10. 2 [*]cm− 1 compared to values of control animals of 66. 6 ± 10. 1 and 147. 4 ± 13. 2 [*]cm− 1, respectively. In addition to the inhibition of tumour angiogenesis, tumour growth and the development of metastasis was strongly reduced in SU 5416 treated animals. This new approach enables non-invasive, repeated and quantitative assessment of tumour vascular network and the effects of antiangiogenic treatment on tumour vasculature in vivo. Thus, quantification of tumour angiogenesis can be used to more accurately classify and monitor tumour biologic characteristics, and to explore aggressiveness of tumours...|$|E
