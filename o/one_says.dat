5|$|Unlike our universe, {{which is}} now known to be {{expanding}} at an accelerating rate, anti-de Sitter space is neither expanding nor contracting. Instead it looks the same at all times. In more technical language, <b>one</b> <b>says</b> that anti-de Sitter space corresponds to a universe with a negative cosmological constant, whereas the real universe has a small positive cosmological constant.|$|E
5|$|She {{was renamed}} Lazar Kaganovich in 1945 to {{disassociate}} her from Lazar's disgraced brother Mikhail Kaganovich. She remained inactive during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945. She spent the post-war period on routine training missions. She was renamed Petropavlovsk on 3 August 1957 after Lazar Kaganovich was purged {{from the government}} after an unsuccessful coup against Nikita Khrushchev that same year. Her superstructure was badly damaged by a Force 12 typhoon on 19 September 1957. Sources disagree on her fate; <b>one</b> <b>says</b> that she was converted into a floating barracks on 6 February 1960 and later sold for scrap while another says that she was simply sold for scrap on 6 February 1960.|$|E
5|$|There are notable {{differences}} between the world described by string theory and the everyday world. In everyday life, there are three familiar dimensions of space (up/down, left/right, and forward/backward), and there is one dimension of time (later/earlier). Thus, {{in the language of}} modern physics, <b>one</b> <b>says</b> that spacetime is four-dimensional. One of the peculiar features of string theory is that it requires extra dimensions of spacetime for its mathematical consistency. In superstring theory, the version of the theory that incorporates a theoretical idea called supersymmetry, there are six extra dimensions of spacetime in addition to the four that are familiar from everyday experience.|$|E

40|$|In [Ben 13], {{the notion}} of logically {{distributive}} category has been introduced to provide a sound and complete semantics to multi-sorted first-order logical theories based on intuitionistic logic. In this note, it will be shown that the definition of logically distributive category can be simplified by dropping two requirements, the <b>one</b> <b>saying</b> that product must distribute over sum, and the <b>one</b> <b>saying</b> that product must distribute over existential quantification...|$|R

25|$|Not {{everyone}} {{who refused to}} participate in any killing or injuring of animals also abstained from the consumption of meat. Hence the question of Buddhist vegetarianism in the earliest stages of that religion's development is controversial. There are two schools of thought. <b>One</b> <b>says</b> that the Buddha and his followers ate meat offered to them by hosts or alms-givers if they {{had no reason to}} suspect that the animal had been slaughtered specifically for their sake. The other <b>one</b> <b>says</b> that the Buddha and his community of monks (sangha) were strict vegetarians and the habit of accepting alms of meat was only tolerated later on, after a decline of discipline.|$|E

25|$|Many {{authors in}} {{combinatorics}} define graded posets {{in such a}} way that all minimal elements of P must have rank 0, and moreover that there is a maximal rank r which is the rank of any maximal element.

Notice that the submanifold that was replaced in M was of the same dimension as M (it was of codimension 0).|$|E
25|$|It is also {{interesting}} {{to pay attention}} to homilies from the doctrinal point of view and with the “gift of tongues”. For many faithful, the Sunday Holy Mass, with its Homily, is the only occasion where they will hear the message of Christ. With evermore renewed commitment, preaching will be very effective, above all if it is directed also at one’s own soul: if one lives what <b>one</b> <b>says</b> and preaches what one lives.|$|E

25|$|An {{apostrophe}} {{is used in}} {{time and}} money references, among others, in constructions such as one hour’s respite, two weeks’ holiday, a dollar’s worth, five pounds’ worth, one mile’s drive from here. This is like an ordinary possessive use. For example, one hour’s respite means a respite of one hour (exactly as the cat’s whiskers means the whiskers of the cat). Exceptions are accounted for in the same way: three months pregnant (in modern usage, <b>one</b> <b>says</b> neither pregnant of three months, nor one month(’)s pregnant).|$|E
25|$|The {{city centre}} was {{planned to be}} functionalist, with major {{buildings}} designed and built {{in the style of}} Modern architecture. The city is surrounded by smaller buildings. The city's central business district (CBD) is still under construction so when <b>one</b> <b>says</b> downtown, they actually mean the Main Mall and Government Enclave areas where tall buildings are usually found. The Main Mall, a car-free shopping and commercial area, runs in an east-west direction with the Government Enclave and National Assembly on the west end and the Gaborone City Town Council complex on the east.|$|E
25|$|The {{symmetry}} {{groups of}} the Platonic solids are a special class of three-dimensional point groups known as polyhedral groups. The high degree of symmetry of the Platonic solids can be interpreted {{in a number of}} ways. Most importantly, the vertices of each solid are all equivalent under the action of the symmetry group, as are the edges and faces. <b>One</b> <b>says</b> the action of the symmetry group is transitive on the vertices, edges, and faces. In fact, this is another way of defining regularity of a polyhedron: a polyhedron is regular if and only if it is vertex-uniform, edge-uniform, and face-uniform.|$|E
