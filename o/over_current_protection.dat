30|$|In an {{electric}} power system, over current or excess current {{is a situation}} where the value larger than intended electric current exists through a conductor, leading to excessive generation of heat which leads to the risk of fire or damage to equipment [5 – 7]. Possible causes for over current include short circuit, excessive load, incorrect design, or a ground fault. Fuses, circuit breakers, temperature sensors and current limiters are commonly used protection mechanisms to control the risks of over current. <b>Over</b> <b>current</b> <b>protection</b> also includes the protection against over loads and this is most widely used protection. Over loading of a machine (or equipment) means the machine is taking more current than its rated current. Hence, with overloading there is an associated temperature rise. The permissible temperature rise has a limit based on insulation class and material. <b>Over</b> <b>current</b> <b>protection</b> against overload is generally provided by thermal relays. <b>Over</b> <b>current</b> <b>protection</b> also includes protection against short-circuit. Short circuits may leads to phase faults, earth faults or winding faults. Short circuit currents are generally several times more than full load current. Hence fast fault clearance is always desirable at the time of short-circuits.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Distribution {{substations}} {{feed power}} to the actual consumers through distributors and service lines. The main equipments are generators and transformers. To protected these equipments and for stability purpose, over-voltages and <b>over</b> <b>currents</b> <b>protection</b> are important to consider. Lightning {{is one of the}} most serious causes of over-voltage. If the power equipments especially at outdoor substation are not protected, the over-voltage will cause burning of insulation. Lightning arrester can protect the damages of equipments. This paper describes the arrester type, lightning terminal and earthing plan of Dagon East substation in Myanmar. DynaVar station class and intermediated arrester (Vrated = 72 kV and I charge (max) = 10 kA) are used in this substation. Most of substation equipments are designed to match with the insulation coordination. If the insulation equipments are higher, the cost is also high. So, to relax this, the lightning arrester must be put in front of the protected equipments and protected zone. For this purposes, this paper specially indicates the safety and saving cost of equipments for overvoltage protection in distribution substation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A high {{impedance}} fault (HIF) {{results when}} an energized primary conductor {{comes in contact}} with a quasi-insulating object such as a tree, structure or equipment, or falls to the ground. The significance of these previously undetectable faults is that they represent a serious public safety hazard {{as well as a}} risk of arcing ignition of fires. A high impedance fault [1] is characterized by having impedance sufficiently high that it is not detected by conventional <b>over</b> <b>current</b> <b>protection,</b> such as fuses and over current relays. Unlike low impedance short circuits, which involve relatively large fault currents and are readily detectable by conventional <b>over</b> <b>current</b> <b>protection,</b> these HIFs represent little threat of damage to power system equipment. High impedance faults produce current levels in the 0 to 50 ampere range. Typically, an HIF exhibits arcing and flashing at the point of contact. Throughout the utility industry, there have been differences of opinion on how often HIFs occur. Normally, utilities do not keep good records on the number of down conductor instances...|$|E

Moreover, as the location of DER in distribution system varies, the configuration of distribution systems also changes. Generally, the distribution systems are radial in nature and <b>over</b> <b>current</b> based <b>protection</b> schemes are set for unidirectional flow of fault currents. Penetration of DER usually causes meshed configuration of distribution systems and on majority of distribution feeders, fault current flows in both the directions [4]. The protection schemes which are designed for unidirectional flow of fault currents fails to provide the adequate protection coordination when DER power is injected in the distribution systems. Moreover, there is a requirement of additional number of direction <b>over</b> <b>current</b> relays. The new settings of <b>over</b> <b>current</b> relays depend upon the location of new incoming DER in the distribution systems.

30|$|In the GCM, {{the fault}} current (FC) is contributed by the DER and the utility, where {{as in the}} IM, the FC is contributed mostly by the DER and partly by the ESD. Thus the FC during IM is {{subsequently}} small in magnitude {{as compared to the}} GCM. The distribution line protection mechanism must enable the safe and reliable operation of the microgrid subjected to faults, both in the GCM and IM, respectively [5]. <b>Over</b> <b>current</b> relays [6 – 8], are attractive for GCM of the microgrids, but due to the intermittent nature of the power generation by the DER’s, the bandwidth of the FC becomes very wide, which makes them unreliable. In this regard, some communication based protection strategies [9, 10], and adaptive relay setting based protection strategies [11, 12] have been proposed for microgrids. These strategies are much effective in GCM of operation of the microgrid, but the response for the IM of operation of the microgrid has not been investigated. Some of the other techniques such as sequence component based methods [13] are very much complex, as the synchronization of the relay depends on manifold settings on the plagiaristic sequence components. In this regard, <b>over</b> <b>current</b> differential <b>protection</b> scheme [14] has been proposed for the microgrid which are effective in the GCM but are unreliable in IM due to limited <b>over</b> <b>current</b> magnitudes in the post fault region.
