During that year, a select committee had produced six reports on the railways, {{at the behest of}} the Board of Trade under its president, W. E. Gladstone. These led to An Act to attach certain Conditions to the construction of future Railways authorised by any Act of the present or succeeding sessions of Parliament; and for other Purposes in relation to Railways, referred to as [...] "Gladstone's Act" [...] or the [...] "1844 Railway Regulation Act".|$|E

5|$|The <b>open</b> <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> were {{originally}} delivered {{with a single}} top-hung side door on each side, but these proved inefficient, and all were eventually converted to side hung double doors. By 1907, most had been fitted with tarpaulin rails. The goods vans used the same underframe, and were fitted with double sliding doors on each side.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the eight}} {{standard}} <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> that {{were built in}} significant quantities as Austauschbauart classes, there were only four types for which there was a further requirement in 1939: the two covered vans (G…s Oppeln and Gl…s Dresden), the stake wagons (Rs Stuttgart) and the <b>open</b> <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> (Om). Because the first three had been continuously developed during the 1930s, they still met wartime requirements and were built in very large batches {{during the early years}} of the war. They sometimes had so-called refinements that speeded up production and minimised the amount of steel used.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>open</b> <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> of the Königsberg class, with a 20-ton {{maximum load}} were {{manufactured}} from 1927 in Austauschbau form. They could barely {{be distinguished from}} the A10 Verbandsbauart versions which had been built from 1923. As a result, the literature often wrongly cites {{the first year of}} manufacture of the Austauschbau form as 1923 or 1924. Its 9,100 mm long undercarriage over buffers (9,800 mm with hand brake) had a 4,500 mm axle base and was also used for the other wagon classes [...] "G Kassel" [...] (see above) and [...] "V Altona" [...] (see above) as well as numerous special and private <b>goods</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bricks {{were first}} made at Gore Hill in 1828 and {{continued}} until 1954. A siding was constructed from the North Shore Railway to a brickworks {{operated by the}} North Sydney Brick and Tile Company in 1902. Horses hauled <b>open</b> 4-wheel <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> over the line. Soon after 1910, the line was extended through a tunnel under Reserve Road. Though blocked from public access, this tunnel remains and forms part of Austcorp's Winevault complex.|$|R
50|$|Whilst {{ordinary}} <b>open</b> or covered <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> {{were used}} for the transportation of cattle and other large animals, special livestock wagons were being developed for small livestock as early as the 19th century. Optimal use of the roughly 2 metre high loading volume was made by loading domestic pigs, goats and sheep on two levels. Some wagons could have intermediate floors fitted for transporting poultry.|$|R
5000|$|The company Electric Railways in the Canton of Zug (ESZ) {{opened on}} 9 September 1913 the {{overland}} tramway track Zug - Oberägeri, Zug - Baar -Thalacker and Nidfurren-Menzingen. On all routes, In the first years, the motor vehicles CFe 4/4 drove off as solo coaches and replaced the automobilebus, because the previously used nine-pound Orion Autobuses were not reliable {{and were not}} comfortable with their solid rubber wheels on the unpaved road.These were driven solo or, as from on 1920, with Railroad cars of the type ESZ Personenwagen C 36 - C 38. Closed and <b>open</b> <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> were used for freight transport.Three CFe4 / 4 were purchased as passenger railcars (No. 1, 2 and 4). The CFe 4/4 with the number 3 was procured as a goods railcar with the designation Fe 4/4 and the ESZ number 21.The name [...] "elephant" [...] comes from the gray paint, which the third CFe 4/4 initially had. This was converted to passenger railcar in 1916 {{as a result of}} the need for more transport capacity for passengers.. The tram service on these routes was put to an end in 1953 and where replaced by buses. The four CFe 4/4 of the ESZ were sold to the Wynental- and Suhrentalbahn WSB (Wynental and Suhrental railway), Langenthal-Jura-Bahn (LJB) and Oberaargau-Jura-Bahnen (OJB).After the end of the electric Tramways in the canton of Zug, all vehicles were sold. Today the passenger railcar C-37 is still in possession of the Jagsttalbahn, an ESZ CFe 4/4 was brought again from Langenthal to Neuheim and restored in the original colors. This ESZ CFe 4/4 is now located in the Zug depot technology history (German: :de:Zuger Depot Technikgeschichte).|$|R
50|$|Since 1922, the {{agreement}} for the mutual use of <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> in international traffic (RIV) has regulated {{the exchange of}} <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> in Europe and the Middle East. In addition, international <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> fleets were created in 1953 in Western Europe with the Europ-Verband and in 1964 in Eastern Europe with the Common <b>Goods</b> <b>Wagon</b> Park (OPW). During {{the second half of}} the 20th century, national <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> classes in Europe were increasingly replaced by Union internationale des chemins de fer (UIC) standard wagons. Since 1964, all <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> in Germany, for example, have had to be classified using the UIC <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> classification system.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>wagons</b> {{of special}} {{construction}} (Sonderbauart): <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> with special features ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>wagons</b> of {{standard}} construction (Regelbauart): standard <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> without special characteristics ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the state}} {{railways}} had been subordinated to {{the sovereignty of}} the German Empire in 1920, the Reich Railway Authority began in 1921 to group all <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> with the same or similar roles into so-called [...] "class districts" [...] (Gattungsbezirke). These were given the names of German cities, usually those with the HQ of a Reich railway division. This method of classifying <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> was first used in 1912 when the Bavarian <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> were reclassified. The DR's <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> reclassification exercise began in 1922 and lasted until 1924. This did not just affected the Verbandsbauart <b>goods</b> <b>wagons,</b> but all <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> in the Deutsche Reichsbahn's fleet.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to their own designs, Saxony also used only slightly modified Prussian <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> designs. After {{the foundation of the}} German State Railway Wagon Association in 1909 the standardised <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> were procured, that were defined in 11 <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> templates.|$|R
50|$|The International Union of Railways groups all {{special classes}} of railway <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> (less those in classes F, H, L, S or Z) into Class U in its <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> {{classification}} system.|$|R
50|$|Since the Union of Private <b>Goods</b> <b>Wagon</b> Companies (Vereinigung der Privatgüterwagen-Interessenten (VPI)) {{was founded}} in 1921, the {{interests}} of private transport organisations in Germany (including <b>wagon</b> hire firms, <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> builders and repair firms, and owners of private sidings) has been jointly represented. The Union has around 100 members who own 50,000 <b>goods</b> <b>wagons.</b> In 2007, they transported 361000000 t of goods. Other countries have similar organisations.|$|R
50|$|The design {{drawings}} for <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> were of special importance. The wagons built to these specifications appeared {{in large numbers}} and formed {{the bulk of the}} German wagon fleet until well after the Second World War. The 1973 DR <b>Goods</b> <b>Wagon</b> Handbook still contained most of the DSV wagon classes as well as the former Prussian Class IId wagons. The most important types are listed in the following table. Note that group IIb are <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> based on old designs, IIc <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> under 15 ton maximum load and IId <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> with at least 15 tons maximum load. A-group wagons are those built to the standard drawings of the DSV. Wagons according to sheets with other nos. are special designs, of which some were also built in large numbers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>wagons</b> of welded {{construction}} (Güterwagen der geschweißter Bauart) {{were developed}} and {{built by the}} Deutsche Reichsbahn in Germany from 1933 to about 1945. With the introduction of welding technology in 1933 almost all wagon components were joined by welding and no longer by rivetting. This enabled <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> to be designed, for example, for higher speeds or for higher payloads {{through the use of}} different types of steel and other engineering changes, but their further development was so heavily influenced by the exigencies of the Second World War that, as early as 1939, the Deutsche Reichsbahn had to temper the design of <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> to the new economic circumstances. Because there were overlaps in the change from the Austauschbauart - <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> made with interchangeable components - to the new welded classes, the period of the changeover cannot be exactly defined. Several standard <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> and their classes are covered in other articles. <b>Goods</b> <b>wagons</b> built during the Second World War that were purely intended for military transport use, are covered under the article on Kriegsbauart - wartime classes.|$|R
50|$|A covered <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> or van is {{a railway}} <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> which is {{designed}} for the transportation of moisture-susceptible goods and therefore fully enclosed by sides and a fixed roof. They are often referred to simply as covered wagons, {{and this is the}} term used by the International Union of Railways (UIC). Since the introduction of the international classification for <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> by the UIC in the 1960s a distinction has been drawn between ordinary and special covered wagons. Other types of wagon, such as refrigerated vans and <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> with opening roofs, are closely related to covered wagons from a design point of view.|$|R
50|$|Open wagons form a {{large group}} of railway <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> {{designed}} primarily for the transportation of bulk goods that are not moisture-retentive and can usually be tipped, dumped or shovelled. The International Union of Railways (UIC) distinguishes between ordinary wagons (Class E/UIC-type 5) and special wagons (F/6). Open wagons often form a significant part of a railway company's <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> fleet; for example, forming just under 40% of the Deutsche Bahn's total <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> stock in Germany.|$|R
50|$|The German term Kriegsbauart (wartime class) {{refers to}} railway <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> classes that were {{developed}} during the Second World War for the Deutsche Reichsbahn. The {{start of the war}} was an arbitrary dividing line for the classification of <b>goods</b> <b>wagons,</b> and did not represent any technological change. In the period shortly before the war, <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> were already being designed from a military perspective. This was particularly true for the stake wagons of 1938, which are occasionally referred to as a 'pre-war class' (Vorkriegsbauart) of wagons.|$|R
50|$|There are two diesel {{locomotives}} {{of the type}} C-50 and a decommissioned MV Kuli. Three passenger cars have been built on the trucks of four wheel <b>goods</b> <b>wagons.</b> In 2006 a larger four wheel passenger car was built. In addition there are some well-worn <b>goods</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R

50|$|With the {{expansion}} of the railway network {{from the middle of the}} 19th century a large number of Ausbesserungswerke sprang up in the entire German speaking world. During the transition from maintenance-intensive steam traction to the more maintenance-friendly electric and diesel locomotives, as well as the increasing rationalisation of workshop operations, the number of Ausbesserungswerke needed could be reduced significantly. Today the Deutsche Bahn only retains the Ausbesserungswerke at Neumünster (coaches), Cottbus (diesel locomotives), Chemnitz (components), Paderborn-Nord (<b>goods</b> <b>wagons),</b> Witten (turnout works), Bremen (diesel locomotives), Kassel (diesel railcars), Krefeld-Oppum (electric railcars), Dessau (electric locomotives), Fulda (components), Nuremberg (electric railcars), Meiningen (historic vehicles, <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> and snow clearing equipment), Eberswalde (<b>goods</b> <b>wagons),</b> Zwickau (<b>goods</b> <b>wagons)</b> and Wittenberge (coaches). In addition, there are Hauptwerkstätten for the Berlin S-Bahn at Berlin-Schöneweide and the Hamburg S-Bahn at Hamburg-Ohlsdorf.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{standardise}} the <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> classes {{of the various}} German state railways (Länderbahnen), the German State Railway Wagon Association (Deutscher Staatsbahnwagenverband or DWV) issued regulations. The so-called Verbandsbauart (association) or DWV wagons, named after this association, were built from 1910 until {{the emergence of the}} Austauschbauart (interchangeable) wagons in 1927. Externally, the Verbandsbauart wagons looked very much like state railway <b>goods</b> <b>wagons,</b> but they were equipped for considerably higher maximum loads of up to 20 tons. A total of 11 classes were defined by norms defined by master engineering drawings (Musterblättern). The wagons were built in numbers that today are hardly conceivable. The most important ones were the A2 and A10 Class wagons of which over 100,000 of each type were built. The Om Class A10 wagons were, including wagons of identical construction made by other nations, the most widespread <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> of all time and formed the major part of the German <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> fleet until the 1950s. Only then did they slowly disappear from the tracks. Many were also modified as part of the German <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> reconstruction programme.|$|R

50|$|Covered <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> for {{transporting}} part-load or parcel {{goods are}} almost {{as old as the}} railway itself. Because part-load goods were the most common freight {{in the early days of}} the railway, the covered van was then the most important type of <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> and, for example, comprised about 40% of the German railways goods fleet until the 1960s. Since then however the open wagon and flat wagon have become more common. By contrast the covered <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> still forms the majority of two-axled wagons in countries like Germany, because the comparatively light freight does not routinely require the use of bogie wagons.|$|R
50|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>wagons</b> or freight <b>wagons</b> (North America: <b>goods</b> cars or freight cars) are {{unpowered}} railway {{vehicles that}} are used for the transportation of cargo. A variety of wagon types are in use to handle different types of goods, but all <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> in a regional network typically have standardized couplers and other fittings, such as hoses for air brakes, allowing different wagon types to be assembled into trains. For tracking and identification purposes, <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> are generally assigned a unique identifier, typically a UIC wagon number, or in North America, a company reporting mark plus a company specific serial number.|$|R
