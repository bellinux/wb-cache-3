Shearsmith suggested that Thomas was motivated by greed. However, he begins to regret his choice when he witnesses Gadge being tortured. Pemberton, though, noted that the real-life accusations of witchcraft must have been based <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>level</b> of belief.|$|E

I don't support arson. I would rather that these buildings weren't standing, so <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>level</b> I understand. I just don't like the idea of that. Maybe that is wishy-washy of me, because I don't want those buildings standing {{if they are going to}} hurt anyone. And the ALF has never hurt mice nor mare.|$|E

Pogo Joe receives [...] "Shadow Bonus" [...] points if few enough barrels are left on the <b>level.</b> Also, <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>levels,</b> the barrels initially appear as invisible, and the player has to guess where the barrels are so Pogo Joe can jump on them.|$|R

500|$|Looking back, Shabazz {{said she}} {{initially}} made an [...] "unrealistic decision" [...] to isolate herself {{because of the}} injustice of her husband's assassination. She realized, however, that giving up because of her husband’s death would not help the world. [...] "It is impossible {{to create an environment}} for children to grow in and develop in isolation.

500|$|A brief drop {{at the end}} of {{the second}} musical {{digression}} creates tension which leads into the final sequence of the song. [...] The refrain reappears for an additional five measures, marching through a transpositional structure that begins in B, repeats at A, and then ends at G for an unexpectedly short single measure. [...] The section uses a descending progression, which mirrors the ascending progression of the previous two refrains. [...] There follows a short section of vocalizing in three-part counterpoint that references the original refrain by reproducing upward transposition. However, this time it settles on A, the concluding key of the song. By the end of [...] "Good Vibrations," [...] all seven scale degrees of the opening E-minor tonic are activated <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
500|$|... "I {{was given}} a set of {{directives}} by Feargus Urquhart, Black Isle Studios' division head.

He also wanted some sort of clear, [...] conflict that influenced all things <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>level</b> but didn't simply overpower everything. We decided on Order vs. Chaos as it's far less black and white than Good vs. Evil... after all, agents of Order or Chaos could potentially use any means at their disposal to bring about the rise of their cause, meaning that either side has its share of goodies and baddies." ...|$|E
500|$|Rhimes {{discussed}} costuming {{choices in}} the scene which saw the interns gather around Denny's deathbed, explaining: [...] "Meredith and George and Cristina and Callie and Alex are all dressed, not for a prom, but for a funeral. Everyone in dark colors, everyone dressed somberly. As {{if they were in}} mourning. Only Izzie is in happy pink. Only Izzie looks like she didn’t know this was coming." [...] Following Denny's death, Heigl approached Rhimes to ask when her character would next have a romantic liaison. Rhimes explained that [...] "Izzie doesn't sleep around". Heigl expressed a desire for Izzie to reunite with Alex, explaining: [...] "I believe <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>level,</b> there's a connection between Izzie and Alex. He can do honorable things even though he's cutting and sarcastic. I would like to ultimately see them together, if not this season, then next." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Jan Delasara, one of {{the major}} themes of [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] is the {{exploration}} of [...] "irresistible physical drives." [...] In Betts' case, his desire to kill is due to a biological need, not a malevolent desire to murder. The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff, in his review of the episode, wrote that [...] "It also helps that Leonard's such an understandably human monster. <b>On</b> <b>some</b> <b>level,</b> he just wants to survive, and he's not happy about {{what he has to do}} to be able to survive." [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] serves as the first story in a multi-season story-arc that features Agent Scully being diagnosed with terminal cancer. Richard Edwards, in the chapter [...] "Some Philosophical Reflections on 'Trust No One'" [...] of their book The Philosophy of The X-Files, argue that Scully withholding the knowledge of her cancer from Mulder is an example of psychological egoism in a protagonist. They reason that by not telling her partner, she is withholding the information in an act of self-interest.|$|E
500|$|The {{main source}} of the game's horror is Alma, a ghostly little girl. Craig Hubbard remarked that [...] "a guy in a mask chasing co-eds with a meat cleaver can be scary, but <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>level</b> you're {{thinking}} to yourself you could probably kick his ass if you got the drop on him...but when a spooky little girl takes out an entire Delta Force squad, how {{are you supposed to}} deal with that?" [...] While Alma has been compared to the character Samara from The Ring, Craig Hubbard stated that she [...] "... was born out of a tradition of eerie, faceless female ghosts ..." [...] and not [...] "... as an answer to any specific movie character." [...] Hubbard acknowledged that Alma [...] "... admittedly bears some visual resemblance to the ghosts in Dark Water or Séance", but [...] "... creepy little girls have been freaking [...] out since The Shining." [...] Developers Dave Matthews and Nathan Hendrickson say the name 'Alma' comes from the character Alma Mobley in Peter Straub's novel Ghost Story.|$|E
500|$|... "Box Cutter" [...] {{featured}} the final regular appearances of recurring Breaking Bad characters David Costabile and Jeremiah Bitsui who, respectively, played Gale Boetticher and Victor. Stand-up comedian Lavell Crawford also {{made his first}} of several guest appearances in [...] "Box Cutter" [...] as Huell, Saul's new bodyguard. Gilligan stated that he named the episode [...] "Box Cutter" [...] mainly because [...] "it just sounded like a cool title", but also because he was concerned that {{the climax of the}} episode took so long to build to that, by calling it [...] "Box Cutter", [...] "Perhaps I was thinking <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>level,</b> 'We'd better let the audience know that there's something at the end of this.'" [...] Although the Breaking Bad staff always intended for Gale to be killed, the audience reaction to [...] "Full Measure" [...] made Gilligan and the Breaking Bad writing staff reconsider whether their plans were the best ones. However, Gilligan said they instead decided to follow their original plan, saying [...] "At the end of the day, the choice we made for how to press forward was the choice we felt was the most honest, and the one that would best continue the story." ...|$|E

50|$|Homosexuality in Haitian Vodou is religiously {{acceptable}} and homosexuals {{are allowed to}} participate in all religious activities. However, in countries with large Vodou populations (such as Benin, Togo or Haiti), some Christian influence may have given homosexuality a social stigma (see homosexuality and Christianity), at least <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>levels</b> of society.|$|R
50|$|Like in the {{original}} arcade and NES version, the player takes control of Mario and must rescue Pauline from Donkey Kong (who are both given updated character designs for this game). Donkey Kong Jr. makes a guest appearance in the game <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>levels,</b> helping his father hinder Mario's progress.|$|R
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound in her stomach, and the one person who has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him really makes you think that there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>level,</b> rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of known all along, that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} much acclaim from television journalists. The storyline involving Joan's prostituting herself {{to secure the}} Jaguar account for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce came in for particular analysis and scrutiny among journalists, as related to its execution and use of themes of female sexuality and sexual objectification. Alan Sepinwall fought with himself over {{the execution of the}} prostitution story in this episode, asking, [...] "If you buy that the partners would be willing to sell Joan, and that Joan would feel the same way, then this is an all-time great episode of the series. But if you don't, then it's Weiner and company making the characters act against their natures to fit the theme." [...] Sepinwall described the story as [...] "something that so fundamentally changes the way you view a number of major characters, and the show that uses them, {{that it has to be}} just about perfect to work, and maybe not even then." [...] Todd VanDerWerff opined that,"'The Other Woman' shouldn’t work. It’s so obviously constructed to be a 'message' episode, and the message is far from subtle: No matter what we try to do to make them equal, men are always going to turn women into objects <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>level,</b> because that’s just how men perceive them." [...] VanDerWerff compared it to the [...] "Employee of the Month" [...] episode of The Sopranos, even going so far as to call [...] "The Other Woman" [...] a stronger episode.|$|E
500|$|Writing [...] "The Sleeper" [...] {{sees the}} {{characters}} in a different light. Although they are the protagonists who work to prevent terrorist threats, the episode sees the MI5 team going {{to great lengths to}} get the sleeper agent, Fred Roberts, {{to do what they want}} him to do so that the producers can make the audience sympathise with the character, as well as despise the main characters <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>level</b> for their methods. There were other instances of the main character going through great lengths to solve the case, including Adam's interrogation methods, brinking on torture, in [...] "Frequently Asked Questions". [...] "Love and Death" [...] sees Danny and Zoe ordered to carry out an assassination. Wolstencroft did not want to do it lightly, as he wanted somebody like Danny going through [...] "something dreadful." [...] He previously did it before with the death of Helen Flynn in [...] "Looking After Our Own", but [...] "Love and Death" [...] did this in the point of view of the killer, not the victim. [...] "Celebrity" [...] introduces a new plot style, which does not involve terror threats. Brenton wrote it as a more light-hearted episode that saw the characters emmeshed in a world they cannot handle. Despite this, Collins stated that MI5 do other duties other than fighting terrorism, though they would not gain as much media attention. Penhale also stated MI5 in the episode are in a way protecting the country, as if a national icon is under threat, the country's morale could drop. [...] "Who Guards the Guards?" [...] and [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] were considered for the second series, but because there was not room for them, the producers bumped the episodes back to the third series.|$|E
