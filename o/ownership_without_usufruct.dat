In this model, tenure {{is part of}} a broader system of organizational governance where the non-profit status of the university requires faculty members to evaluate and monitor both university administrators and trustees. The nature of the employment contract provides the incentives for the faculty to behave as residual claimants. Tenure is necessary for faculty to be willing to assume the roles normally associated with <b>ownership</b> <b>without</b> fear or reprisal from trustees and administrators. ...|$|R

None had immediately emerged as a candidate to succeed Peter, and he acknowledged that the new economics of the game had dictated that the days of family baseball <b>ownership,</b> <b>without</b> support of a separate corporation, were largely over.

40|$|Given the {{governance}} problem posed by CPR, and facing {{the challenge of}} institutional obstacles to self-organization, condominium owners chose to create innovations to the traditional pattern of governance. In this paper, {{in accordance with the}} theoretical method of Elinor Ostrom’s principles of institutional design, two typical cases: ―Homeowner Representative Assembly System ‖ and ―Trusteeship of Property Management System ‖ are compared, analyzed and evaluated. The inquiry derives the institutional incentive conditions for collective action by the specified groups and the requirements of common interest <b>ownership</b> <b>without</b> outside authorities or coercive force. It is shown that homeowner groups can solve the problem of supplying new institutions in ways that go beyond the assumptions of traditional theories of the collective action problem...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a novel {{copyright}} protection scheme for digital images based on Visual Cryptography and Statistics is proposed. In our scheme, the theories and properties of sampling distribution of means and visual cryptography are employed {{to achieve the}} requirements of robustness and security. Our method {{does not need to}} alter the original image and can identify the <b>ownership</b> <b>without</b> resorting to the original image. Besides, our method allows multiple watermarks to be registered for a single host image without causing any damage to other hidden watermarks. Moreover, it is also possible for our scheme to cast a larger watermark into a smaller host image. Finally, experimental results will show the robustness of our scheme against several common attacks.

5000|$|Since 1971, {{there has}} been no doubt about the {{destination}} of the goal posts any time they have been torn down following a home football game. 1971 marked the first year in which the goal posts ended up at Harpo's Bar and Grill at 29 S. Tenth Street in Columbia. Although no concrete reasoning is known behind the tradition, it is suggested that Harpo's became the destination because of its popularity among alumni returning to Columbia on game days and because the restaurant {{is one of the few}} places that had remained under consistent <b>ownership</b> <b>without</b> any name changes, so alumni and students all easily identify with the establishment.

40|$|Carsharing is a {{progressive}} model of transportation that allows members to obtain benefits of private vehicle <b>ownership</b> <b>without</b> {{the inclusion of}} fixed costs and responsibilities typically associated with ownership. Carsharing provides users with a fleet of shared vehicles that can be rented for periods of time, charging users on a needs-basis. Carsharing is appealing to individuals whose need for a private vehicle is limited, and the carsharing industry is aided by factors such as: density, educational attainment, intermodal tranSit, and age. Across the nation, carsharing is growing at an exponential rate in dense metropolitan areas such as college campuses. By instituting a carsharing program, Ball State University would effectively reduce costs at the University level and ultimately for state taxpayers. Carsharing will enhance Ball State University campus services and amenities, along with strengthening the University's commitment to protect the environment. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} link between second-best {{production}} efficiency and the constraints on income distribution imposed by private ownership of firms in economies with Ramsey taxation. We review the result of Dasgupta and Stiglitz [1972], Mirrlees [1972], Hahn [1973], and Sadka [1977] about firm-specific profit taxation leading to second-best production efficiency. Problems in the proofs of this result in these papers have been identified by Reinhorn [2005]. We provide an alternative, and with some hope a more intuitive, proof of this result. The mechanism employed in our proof {{is also used to}} show second-best production efficiency under some configuarations of private <b>ownership</b> <b>without</b> any (or at best, uniform) profit taxation. The results obtained raise questions about the genericity of the phenomenon of second-best production inefficiency and about recovering social shadow prices in such economies.

50|$|In {{common law}} countries, {{possession}} {{is itself a}} property right. The owner of a property has the right of possession and may assign that right wholly or partially to another who may then also assign the right of possession to a third party. For example, an owner of residential property may assign the right of possession to a property manager under a property management contract who may then assign the right of possession to a tenant under a rental agreement. There is a rebuttable presumption that the possessor of property also has the right of possession, and {{evidence to the contrary}} may be offered to establish who has the legal right of possession to determine who should have actual possession, which may include evidence of <b>ownership</b> (<b>without</b> assignment of the right of possession) or evidence of a superior right of possession <b>without</b> <b>ownership.</b> Possession of a thing for long enough can become ownership by termination of the previous owner's right of possession and ownership rights.
