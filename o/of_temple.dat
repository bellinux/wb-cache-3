5|$|Although {{originally}} anti-Zionist, Stern's views {{changed in}} the 1940s, and by 1942 he was strongly supported Jewish nationalism.

5|$|Although the pharaoh {{delegated}} his authority, {{the performance}} <b>of</b> <b>temple</b> rituals {{was still an}} official duty, restricted to high-ranking priests. The participation of the general populace in most ceremonies was prohibited. Much of the lay religious activity in Egypt instead took place in private and community shrines, separate from the official temples. As the primary link between the human and divine realms, temples attracted considerable veneration from ordinary Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|Birnholz was {{followed}} by Eric Gurvis, Steven Engel, and Jim Egolf, all of whom, like Nussbaum before them, also served as the rabbis <b>of</b> <b>Temple</b> Beth El in Lexington, Mississippi, leading services there once a month on Sunday.

5|$|Bonshō have {{occasionally}} {{been used}} as musical instruments in modern compositions.

A temple bell is also used in performances of Jacob Druckman's piece Lamia, {{in which it is}} rung while placed on top of a kettledrum. Modern composers for percussion have sometimes used the temple bell to replace the now common sound of the orchestral tam-tam.|$|E

5|$|By 1955, Phoenix's Jewish {{population}} {{had grown to}} over 3,000 families, and the city still had two Jewish congregations, Beth Israel and Beth El. That year, {{with the support of}} Krohn, Albert Plotkin joined Beth Israel as rabbi. Born in 1920 and raised in South Bend, Indiana, his parents were immigrants from Russia. After getting an undergraduate degree from the University of Notre Dame, he entered Hebrew Union College in 1943 – on academic probation, because he had taken no Hebrew at Notre Dame. He was ordained by Hebrew Union College in 1948, graduating with a Master of Hebrew Letters. Plotkin had started his rabbinic career as assistant rabbi <b>of</b> <b>Temple</b> De Hirsch in Seattle, his first pulpit after ordination. There he met his future wife Sylvia Pincus, whose family were long-time members <b>of</b> <b>Temple</b> De Hirsch. They married a year later, and shortly after moved to Spokane, Washington, where Plotkin became senior rabbi at Temple Emanuel.|$|E
5|$|During World War II {{the demand}} for metal for the war effort {{resulted}} in many bells being melted down for scrap. As a result, those that survived are generally regarded as important historic artifacts. More than 70,000 bells (approximately 90 per cent of the bonshō then in existence) were destroyed in this way. However, rapid production of bells during the post-war period meant that by 1995 the number <b>of</b> <b>temple</b> bells in Japan had returned to pre-war levels.|$|E
