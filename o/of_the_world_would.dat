5|$|After {{leaving the}} Nation of Islam, MalcolmX {{announced}} {{his willingness to}} work with leaders {{of the civil rights}} movement, though he advocated some changes to their policies. He felt that calling the movement a struggle for civil rights would keep the issue within the United States, while changing the focus to human rights would make it an international concern. The movement could then bring its complaints before the United Nations, where MalcolmX said the emerging nations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> add their support.|$|E

25|$|In 1925, the Czech esotericist Franz Sättler {{founded a}} pagan {{religion}} known as Adonism, {{devoted to the}} ancient Greek god Adonis, whom Sättler equated with the Christian Satan, and which purported that the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> come in the year 2000.

Followers of Camping claimed that around 200 million people (approximately 2.8% of the world's 2011 population) would be raptured, and publicized the prediction in numerous countries.|$|E
25|$|While {{most of this}} {{research}} was carried out in South Africa, it was recognised that further study in other areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> be useful in selecting dung beetle species for introduction to Australian climates not matched by those in South Africa. To this end, a further research unit was set up in Montpellier, France, as a base from which to study European species that may be more suited for introduction to cooler, southern areas of Australia.|$|E

25|$|Fossils in China {{demonstrate}} a migration of Asian mammals into North America around 55 million years ago. By 20 million years ago, evidence in North America shows a further interchange of mammalian species. Some, like the ancient saber-toothed cats, have a recurring geographical range: Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America. The {{only way they}} could reach the New World was by the Bering land bridge.

25|$|Satellite radio (also called SDARS by the FCC) uses two {{proprietary}} standards instead of DAB-S, which requires users to change equipment when switching from one provider to the other, and prevents other competitors from offering new choices as stations {{can do on}} terrestrial radio. Had the FCC picked DAB-T for terrestrial radio, no separate satellite receiver would have been needed at all, and the only difference from DAB receivers in the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> be the need to tune S band instead of L band.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1983 World Cup in England, an {{unofficial}} rotation system was introduced {{so that each}} cricket playing region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> {{have the opportunity to}} host World Cup after every twenty years. However, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and Cricinfo, owing to the increasing power and role of the Asian nations, particularly India, this convention has not been strictly adhered to. For example, according to the rotation system, Australia and New Zealand should have been hosts for the event in 2011. But, the subcontinent won the bid because it would fetch additional US$400million in profit.|$|E

25|$|In the Islamic apocalyptic tradition, the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> be {{preceded by}} {{the release of}} Gog and Magog, whose {{destruction}} by God in a single night would usher in the Day of Resurrection. Reinterpretation did not generally continue after Classical times, but {{the needs of the}} modern world have produced a new body of apocalyptic literature in which Gog and Magog are identified as the Jews and Israel, or the Ten Lost Tribes, or sometimes as Communist Russia and China. One problem these writers have had to confront is the barrier holding Gog and Magog back, which is not {{to be found in the}} modern world: the answer varies, some writers saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are invisible.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been speculated by Georges Declercq that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a {{calendar}} based on the incarnation of Christ was intended to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world. At the time, it was believed by some that the Resurrection and end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> occur 500 years {{after the birth of}} Jesus. The old Anno Mundi calendar theoretically commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the Old Testament. It was believed that, based on the Anno Mundi calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno Mundi calendar marking the end of the world. Anno Mundi 6000 (approximately AD 500) was thus equated with the resurrection {{and the end of the}} world but this date had already passed in the time of Dionysius.|$|E

500|$|The {{potential}} for major sea level rise depends mostly on a significant melting {{of the polar}} ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica, as {{this is where the}} vast majority of glacial ice is located.

500|$|When the indaba {{ended on}} 26 October, the chiefs and headmen {{returned}} a unanimous decision {{to support the}} government's stand for independence under the 1961 constitution, attesting in their report that [...] "people who live far away {{do not understand the}} problems of our country". This verdict was rejected by the nationalist movement {{on the grounds that the}} chiefs received governmental salaries; the chiefs countered that the black MPs in parliamentary opposition also received such salaries, but still opposed the government. Malvern, who was becoming perturbed by the RF's actions, dismissed the indaba as a [...] "swindle", asserting that the chiefs no longer had any real power; the British simply ignored the whole exercise. On 27 October, Wilson released a firm statement regarding Britain's intended response to UDI, warning that Rhodesia's economic and political ties with Britain, the Commonwealth and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> be immediately severed amid a campaign of sanctions if Smith's government went ahead with UDI. This was intended to discourage white Rhodesians from voting for independence in the referendum, for which the RF campaign slogan was [...] "Yes means Unity, not UDI". Wilson was pleased when Douglas-Home, his leading opponent in the House of Commons, praised the statement as [...] "rough but right". On 5 November 1964, Rhodesia's mostly white electorate voted [...] "yes" [...] to independence under the 1961 constitution by a margin of 89%, prompting Smith to declare that the British condition of acceptability to the people as a whole had been met.|$|E
