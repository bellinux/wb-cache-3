40|$|We {{consider}} {{a class of}} parametrically forced Hamiltonian systems with one-and-a-half degrees of freedom and study <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dynamics when <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> is relatively high or low. We show that, provided <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> is sufficiently high, KAM theorem may be applied even when <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> amplitude is {{far away from the}} perturbation regime. A similar result is obtained for sufficiently low frequency forcing, but in that case we need <b>the</b> amplitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> to be not too large; however we are still able to {{consider a}}mplitudes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> which are outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perturbation regime.

5|$|Although {{the force}} was {{commanded}} by its commissioner, {{there was also}} an influential senior post of comptroller, created in 1880 in response to Macleod's financial mismanagement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>force.</b> For most of the force's history the role was occupied by Frederick White, until replaced by A. A. Mclean in 1913. The comptroller was responsible for keeping account of expenditure, auditing and managing procurement, and effectively removed most of the non-operational functions from the commissioner's responsibility. White was a political client of Prime Minister John Macdonald, who took a close interest in the management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>force,</b> and the post became critical for garnering support from Ottawa for investment in the police.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1991, Croatia had no regular army; to bolster its defence, the country doubled its police personnel to about 20,000.

In total, the Force Publique comprised approximately 40,000 men and was racially segregated meaning that blacks could not become officers.
