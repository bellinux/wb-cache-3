5|$|Close to Lakefield and off {{the road}} in their own {{enclosure}} were three dwellings known as Lakefield Cottages. Mr. Rogerson, a gardener and caretaker at Lakefield, lived {{in one of the}} cottages, and eventually his wife's two pedigree Pomeranians– Darkie and Duchess– would become the models for Potter's fictional Duchess. Darkie had a fine black mane, but Duchess was more intelligent and could sit up with a lump of sugar balanced <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E
25|$|She re-entered rehab {{to try to}} kick her drug habit. Westbrook {{has since}} {{undergone}} reconstructive surgery <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> to replace her eroded septum.|$|E
25|$|Pathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's {{forensic}} science institute, performed the autopsy on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of sixteen bruises and seven cuts. These included several bruises {{and a couple}} of insubstantial cuts on the palm of her hand. Bruises <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> nostrils, mouth, and underneath her jaw were compatible with a hand being clamped over her mouth and nose. Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's {{forensic science}} institute who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.|$|E

60|$|In five minutes, Daisy {{was back}} again, with a wide-awake face, {{a bit of}} dough {{in her hand and}} a dab of flour <b>on</b> <b>her</b> little <b>nose.</b>|$|R
60|$|Before Elsie could stammer forth her gratified acceptance, a {{young woman}} with gold glasses <b>on</b> <b>her</b> bony <b>nose</b> and <b>her</b> hands in her jacket pockets seized her arm and drew her aside.|$|R
25|$|Another {{landmark}} {{case was}} People v. Marx, which occurred in California in 1975. A woman {{was murdered by}} strangulation after being sexually assaulted. She was bitten several times <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose.</b> Walter Marx {{was identified as a}} suspect and dental impressions were made of his teeth. Impressions and photographs were also taken of the woman’s injured nose. These samples along with other models and casts were evaluated using a variety of techniques, including two-dimensional and three-dimensional comparisons, and acetate overlays. Three experts testified that the bite marks on the woman’s nose were indeed made by Marx and he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter.|$|E
25|$|She {{then made}} her way to the United States and competed for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) once again. Debuting as an {{associate}} of Luna Vachon, Nakano competed against the WWF Women's Champion, Alundra Blayze in August 1994 at SummerSlam, but failed to win the title. Nakano eventually defeated Blayze for the title on November 20, 1994 in Tokyo at the Big Egg Wrestling Universe event. Nakano held the title for approximately five months, until losing it back to Blayze on the April 3, 1995 episode of Raw. The WWF had planned on bringing in Bertha Faye to feud with Nakano while Blayze got plastic surgery <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> and breasts, but Nakano was found in possession of cocaine and quickly fired from the company.|$|E
60|$|Fixing {{the glasses}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> {{she looked at}} the green island with a {{ruthless}} stare.|$|E
50|$|According to her, {{because of}} her supreme cuteness, Amy had cuteness {{reduction}} surgery <b>on</b> <b>her</b> cheek and <b>nose</b> {{when she was a}} teenager.|$|R
60|$|ST. HERBERT I understand. Woman has {{suddenly}} started hitting man <b>on</b> the <b>nose.</b> <b>Her</b> excuse being {{that she really}} couldn't keep her hands off him any longer.|$|R
5|$|Helena was {{a lively}} and outspoken child, and reacted against brotherly teasing by {{punching}} the bully <b>on</b> the <b>nose.</b> <b>Her</b> early talents included drawing. Lady Augusta Stanley, a lady-in-waiting to the Queen, commented favourably on the three-year-old Helena's artwork.|$|R
60|$|She became {{absorbed in}} gazing {{at herself in}} the mirror, while she dabbed some powder <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> and dabbed it off again.|$|E
60|$|MARGARET (gleaming). Daddy, I {{can do it}} still! (Putting a biscuit <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose.)</b> Here is {{the last}} of my supper. Say 'snap,' Daddy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Them skeeters'll be {{the death}} of me yet," [...] Kink Mitchell whimpered, as the canoe felt the current <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> and leaped out from the bank.|$|E
500|$|The teams {{wanted to}} [...] "maintain {{some sort of}} the Megan Fox allure" [...] but {{said that it was}} [...] "incredibly {{difficult}} because as soon as [...] warped her face in any direction, the shine kind of came off it". To combat this, they ended up focusing <b>on</b> anything below <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> where they had the freedom to make things [...] "as horrific as [...] needed to" [...] and then above <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> [...] " [...] could manipulate it somewhat with warps and color correction in her eye sockets. So even at her worst, she had some of that sexiness throughout".|$|R
50|$|At 09:50 on 16 April 1925 the R33 {{was torn}} from the mast at Pulham during a gale, and was {{carried away with}} only a partial crew of 20 men <b>on</b> board. <b>Her</b> <b>nose</b> {{partially}} collapsed and the first gas cell deflated leaving her low in the bow. The crew on board started the engines, gaining some height, and rigged a cover for the bow section, but the R33 was blown out over the North Sea. A Royal Navy vessel was readied and left the nearby port of Lowestoft in case the R33 came down in the sea. The local lifeboat was launched, but was driven back by the weather conditions.|$|R
25|$|Later on, Selby {{would try}} the daisy routine on Mrs. Warbucks, but she (or perhaps another servant, {{it was never}} specified) would spank him because a bee flew out of the flowers and stung <b>her</b> <b>on</b> the <b>nose.</b> For this, Annie laughed at him.|$|R
6000|$|... "If we are {{to leave}} a little after nine," [...] said that lady, {{balancing}} her glasses <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> and glancing at the card, [...] "we have not, I'm afraid, time for many courses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope--Uncle Al--doesn't {{come for}} a month," [...] {{declared}} Bo, {{as she tried to}} get her breath. There was a brown spot <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> and one on each cheek, suspiciously close to her mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} she does for her complexion. Never saw such a lovely color. Real roses and cream," [...] said Julia, {{shutting}} one eye to survey the freckles <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> with a gloomy frown.|$|E
60|$|The gentleman on his right, who sat at {{the head}} of the table, was of the humorous, subironical American expression, and a smile at the corner of his kindly mouth, under an iron-gray full beard cut short, at once {{questioned}} and tolerated the new-comers as he glanced at them. He responded to March's bow almost as decidedly as the nice boy, whose mother he confronted at the other end of the table, and with his comely bulk formed an interesting contrast to her vivid slightness. She was brilliantly dark, behind the gleam of the gold-rimmed glasses perched <b>on</b> <b>her</b> pretty <b>nose.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1962, Raymond was a {{passenger}} {{in a car}} that crashed into a tree <b>on</b> Sunset Boulevard. <b>Her</b> <b>nose</b> was severed by the rear view mirror. After {{a little more than}} a year of extensive plastic surgery and recovery she returned to acting. In 1977, while working on the soap opera Days of Our Lives, after only three appearances, she accidentally tripped on a telephone cord and broke her ankle. She was written out of the show. In 1984, she broke both hips, and in 1994, she broke her shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|Such was the instinctive patriotism of {{the crowd}} that the cry was taken up in several quarters; and for the moment Mr. Lavender {{remained}} speechless from astonishment. The cries of [...] "Pro-German!" [...] increased in volume, and a stone hitting <b>her</b> <b>on</b> the <b>nose</b> caused Blink to utter a yelp; Mr. Lavender's eyes blazed.|$|R
60|$|A cracked mirror hung by {{the chamber}} window {{and in an}} unlucky moment Anne looked into it. There were those seven {{freckles}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> more rampant than ever, {{or so it seemed}} in the glare of light from the unshaded window.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold your tongue, sir," [...] said Miss Clapperclaw, tossing up her virgin {{head with}} an indignant blush <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose.</b> [...] "It's a sin and {{a shame that}} such a {{creature}} should be riding in her carriage, forsooth, when honest people must go on foot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will be splendid. My poor Linda {{was knocked}} right over <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose.</b> Darlin' child, {{come to your}} mother and be fixed," [...] purred Betty, lifting the fallen idol from a grove of chickweed, and tenderly {{brushing}} the dirt from Belinda's heroically smiling face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{your kind}} word makes me very happy," [...] said the sculptor, [...] "and I need it, just now, {{on behalf of}} my Cleopatra. That {{inevitable}} period has come,--for I have found it inevitable, in regard to all my works,--when I look at what I fancied to be a statue, lacking only breath to make it live, and find it a mere lump of senseless stone, into which I have not really succeeded in moulding the spiritual part of my idea. I should like, now,--only it would be such shameful treatment for a discrowned queen, and my own offspring too,--I should like to hit poor Cleopatra a bitter blow <b>on</b> <b>her</b> Egyptian <b>nose</b> with this mallet." ...|$|R
60|$|The Professor {{discovered}} me in meditation amid tea-girls at {{the back}} of the Ueno Park in the heart of Tokio. My 'rickshaw coolie sat by my side drinking tea from daintiest china, and eating maccaroons. I thought of Sterne's donkey and smiled vacuously into the blue above the trees. The tea-girls giggled. One of them captured my spectacles, perched them <b>on</b> <b>her</b> own snubby-chubby <b>nose,</b> and ran about among her cackling fellows.|$|R
60|$|Phil bounced up, wiped <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> {{and fell}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> knees before Anne.|$|R
60|$|With the bag {{slung over}} her arm, and {{rattling}} as she waddled away, she waddled to the door, where {{she stopped to}} inquire if she should leave us a lock of her hair. 'Ain't I volatile?' she added, as a commentary on this offer, and, with her finger <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> departed.|$|E
6000|$|... "The anchor slipped {{enough to}} let her drive ahead a bit," [...] Bob said, in explanation, [...] "an' then brought up just as she struck. You'll most likely find the hawser taut as an iron bar; and that, {{together}} with the hold the sand has got <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> keeps everything firm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not they," [...] she answered; [...] "they {{are afraid}} of me. Why, the other day I bundled one of them, whom I found {{listening}} at the door, head first down the stairs. She complained to the marquis, but he only laughed at her, and now she lies abed with a plaster <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose.</b> But tell me your tale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I tell Roxy," [...] said Miss Ruey, who {{had been}} absent from the room to hold private {{consultations}} with Miss Emily concerning the biscuits and sponge-cake for tea, and who now sat down to the quilt and began to unroll a capacious and very limp calico thread-case; and placing <b>her</b> spectacles awry <b>on</b> <b>her</b> little pug <b>nose,</b> she {{began a series of}} ingenious dodges with her thread, designed to hit the eye of her needle.|$|R
50|$|She gives Dennis his {{teddy bear}} and also {{says she will}} not turn off the light. She begins to kiss Dennis, but Dennis reacts and bites <b>her</b> <b>on</b> the <b>nose.</b> Dennis's mother then {{promises}} her son that the humans won't get him. She then readies him for bed. However, Dennis concludes he will sleep under his bed so the humans {{will not be able}} to find him.|$|R
60|$|Christian {{kissed the}} gloved hand resting <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm. Miss Naylor bobbed her head; a tear trickled off <b>her</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|R
