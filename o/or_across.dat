5|$|The huia's {{movements}} are little known, {{but it was}} most likely sedentary. The huia {{is thought to have}} undertaken seasonal movements, living in montane forests in the summer and moving down into lowland forests in the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes. Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds, the saddleback and the kōkako, the huia was a weak flier and could only fly for short distances, and seldom above tree height. More often it would use its powerful legs to propel it in long leaps and bounds through the canopy <b>or</b> <b>across</b> the forest floor, or it would cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread for balance.|$|E

5|$|Legacy Parkway {{is part of}} {{the larger}} Legacy Highway project first {{proposed}} by then-governor Mike Leavitt, which ultimately will run north from Nephi toward Brigham City. The concept of a western Davis County highway has existed since the 1960s, with some proposals routing the highway over Antelope Island <b>or</b> <b>across</b> Farmington Bay. Legacy Parkway was to extend to {{the west side of the}} Salt Lake City International Airport and connect to I-80 at 5600West; however, that plan was abandoned in October 1997. A survey taken by Valley Research for The Salt Lake Tribune in December 1997 showed 64percent of Davis County residents were in support of building the parkway, with just 19percent opposing the construction. State officials had hoped to have the parkway open in time for the 2002 Winter Olympics being held in Salt Lake City; however, construction was delayed too many times for that to occur.|$|E
5|$|The wolf is a {{frequent}} charge in English armory. It is illustrated as a supporter on the shields of Lord Welby, Rendel, and Viscount Wolseley, {{and can be found}} on the coat of arms of Lovett and the vast majority of the Wilsons and Lows. The demi-wolf is a common crest, appearing in the arms and crests of members of many families, including that of the Wolfes, whose crest depicts a demi-wolf holding a crown in its paws, in reference to the assistance the family gave to Charles II during the battle of Worcester. Wolf heads are common in Scottish heraldry, particularly in the coats of Clan Robertson and Skene. The wolf is the most common animal in Spanish heraldry, and is often depicted as carrying a lamb in its mouth, <b>or</b> <b>across</b> its back. The wolf is featured on the flags of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin and the Pawnee. In modern times, the wolf is widely used as an emblem for military and paramilitary groups. It is the unofficial symbol of the spetsnaz, and serves as the logo of the Turkish Grey Wolves. During the Yugoslav Wars, several Serb paramilitary units adopted the wolf as their symbol, including the White Wolves and the Wolves of Vučjak.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the Greenlee-Thomas model (Greenlee & Thomas, 1993), {{there are two other}} prominent approaches for describing set-size effects in VSTM. These two approaches can be referred to as sample size models (Palmer, 1990), and urn models (e.g., Pashler, 1988). They differ from the Greenlee-Thomas (1993) model by: (1) ascribing the root cause of set-size effects to a stage prior to decision making; and (2) making no theoretical distinction between decisions made in the same, <b>or</b> <b>across</b> different, perceptual dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Inductive loops can {{be placed}} in a roadbed to detect {{vehicles}} as they pass through the loop's magnetic field.

Loops {{can be placed}} in a single lane <b>or</b> <b>across</b> multiple lanes, and they work with very slow or stopped vehicles as well as vehicles moving at high speed.|$|E

It can also be seen mud-puddling or at bird droppings.|$|E

Gee talks of identity differences based on social and cultural views of identity and identifies four of these views, each of which are influenced by different forms of power, though they all {{have an effect on}} one another. Gee describes them as “four ways to formulate questions about how identity is functioning for a specific person (child or adult) in a given context <b>or</b> <b>across</b> a set of contexts” (p.101).|$|E

The stretch of water to Dargaville is broad and straight and provides an easy to navigate route into what were then kauri forests in the interior. Dargaville flourished as kauri fell and mills buzzed. Immigrants from Britain and Croatia were attracted to the area.
