5|$|Vesta is {{the only}} known intact {{asteroid}} that has been resurfaced in this manner. Because of this, some scientists refer to Vesta as a protoplanet.

5|$|In {{many cases}} {{constant}} supervision is required because, for various reasons, such as changes in manufacturing processes, products that <b>once</b> <b>were</b> kosher may {{cease to be}} so. For example, a kosher lubricating oil may be replaced by one containing tallow, which many rabbinic authorities view as non-kosher. Such changes are often co-ordinated with the supervising rabbi, or supervising organisation, to ensure that new packaging does not suggest any hechsher or kashrut. In some cases, however, existing stocks of pre-printed labels with the hechsher may continue to be used on the now non-kosher product. An active grapevine among the Jewish community discusses which products are now questionable, as well as products which have become kosher but whose labels have yet to carry the hechsher. Some newspapers and periodicals also discuss kashrut products.|$|E

When the United States Department of Justice used the authority of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 to conduct searches of what <b>once</b> <b>were</b> confidential library databases, Krug raised a public outcry against this activity by the government.|$|E
