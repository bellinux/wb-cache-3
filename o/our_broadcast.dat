5000|$|In 1972, the Kings {{made two}} key acquisitions. First, {{the rise of}} rookie goaltender Ken Dryden in Montreal made goaltender Rogie Vachon expendable, and the Kings {{obtained}} him in a trade with the Canadiens on November 4, 1971. After years of a [...] "revolving door" [...] in goal, Vachon solidified the position, often in spectacular fashion. For the next five years, the Forum was often filled with chants of [...] "Rogie!, Rogie!" [...] as Vachon made many a great save. In addition, the Kings obtained former Toronto Maple Leafs winger Bob Pulford, first {{as a player and}} then as their head coach. Under Pulford's disciplined direction, the Kings went from being one of the worst defensive teams in the league to one of the best. It took him just two seasons to lead the Kings back to the playoffs and in 1974, they faced the Chicago Blackhawks, only to be eliminated in five games. Pulford eventually led the team to three of the most successful seasons in franchise history, including a 105-point season in 1974-75 that is still a franchise record. They finished second behind Montreal in the Norris Division, which was relatively strong compared to the other divisions. Also in 1975 that season, due to the growing number of teams, the NHL introduced a new playoff structure, including a best of three preliminary round to the playoffs for the bottom eight of the qualifying twelve teams (the winners of each division automatically receiving a berth into the next round). With the fourth-best record in the league, the Kings were heavy favorites against the Maple Leafs, who finished with 78 points. Despite winning game one at home in the Forum, the Kings lost game two in Toronto on April 10. Due to scheduling conflicts, and owner Jack Kent Cooke's refusal to play an afternoon game on April 12, game three was played at the Forum the next day, April 11, instead, giving each team less rest between the games. The Kings, having an older core of players that were jet-lagged from the cross country flight right before the game, simply did not have the energy due to lack of rest and recovery, and were upset in the deciding game at home 2-1 by the lowly but younger Maple Leafs. As Bob Miller said in his book, Tales from the Los Angeles Kings, [...] "I'll never forget, with 10 seconds left, looking down from <b>our</b> <b>broadcast</b> location, seeing Toronto owner Harold Ballard and his sidekick King Clancy hugging and jumping {{up and down in the}} aisle as they eliminated the heavily favored Kings. It was such a disappointment after a tremendous season that Bob Pulford left the building in tears... because of Cooke's stubbornness the Kings' best season ever was wasted." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} method for wide-area message passing systems to perform {{collective}} operations using dynamically created spanning trees. In our proposal, broadcasts and reductions are performed efficiently using topology-aware spanning trees constructed at run-time; processors autonomously measure latency and bandwidth to create latency-aware trees for short messages and bandwidth-aware trees for long messages. Our spanning trees adapt to topology changes due to the joining or leaving of processors; when processors join or leave a computation, processors repair the spanning trees so that effective execution of collective operations can continue. With 128 to 201 processors distributed over 3 to 4 clusters, the latency of <b>our</b> <b>broadcast</b> was within a factor of 2 of a static topology-aware implementation, and <b>our</b> <b>broadcast</b> achieved 82 percent of the bandwidth of a static topology-aware implementation. Moreover, when some processors joined or left a computation, <b>our</b> <b>broadcast</b> temporarily performed poorly for about 8 seconds while the spanning trees adapted to the new topology, but completed successfully even during this time.

40|$|Abstract—A key {{challenge}} for wireless networks in which nodes can move is for each node {{to keep track}} of its dynamically changing set of nearby nodes (neighbors). We present a solution for nodes to maintain neighbor knowledge where nodes communicate via wireless broadcast and are restricted to move on a two-dimensional grid-type network. A grid-type network is a collection of one-dimensional lines that may intersect each other. For nodes to exchange neighbor information, we construct a deterministic collision-free broadcast schedule which utilizes time division multiplexing and geographical segmentation. Under a certain node density requirement and assuming initial neighbor knowledge, <b>our</b> <b>broadcast</b> schedule tolerates node movement on the grid-type network while providing deterministic guarantees in maintaining neighbor knowledge. We also provide a lower bound on the speed of a message propagation given <b>our</b> <b>broadcast</b> schedule. In addition, we consider grouping nodes into clusters and show that, under certain conditions, neighbor knowledge is maintained when two different clusters move close to each other. Finally, we address the issue of obtaining initial neighbor knowledge. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we have {{proposed}} a time efficient, energy saving and robust broadcast/multicast protocol for reconfigurable cluster-based sensor network. In <b>our</b> <b>broadcast</b> protocol, a broadcast can be executed 2 2 inO(hd � D) rounds and each node needs to be awake in 2 O(D) rounds, where D and d are the degrees of G and the sub-network induced by the network backbone, respectively, and h is {{the height of the}} backbone. When k channels are available, the broadcast can be executed 2 2 inO((hd � D) / k) rounds and each. We show that <b>our</b> <b>broadcast</b> protocol can be readily modified to the one for multicast. The cluster-based architecture used in this paper for a sensor network is an improved version in [19]. The proposed network architecture is self-constructible and self-reconfigurable by using two topological management operations: node-move-in and node-move-out. Details of the protocol along with experimental results are discussed. Simulation results show that the protocol performance is much better than that in the theoretical analysis. 1...|$|E

Tough realized that a highly advanced intelligence could learn our languages and learn about our civilization in great detail.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{years have}} seen {{intensive}} investigations of Periodic Broadcast, an attractive paradigm for broadcasting popular videos. In this paradigm, the server simply broadcasts segments of a popular video periodically {{on a number of}} communication channels. A large number of clients can be served simultaneously by tuning into these channels to receive segments of the requested video. A playback can begin as soon as a client can access the first segment. Periodic Broadcast guarantees a small maximum service delay regardless of the number of concurrent clients. Existing periodic broadcast techniques are typically evaluated through analytical assessment. While these results are good performance indicators, they cannot demonstrate subtle implementation difficulty that can prohibit these techniques from practical deployment. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a video broadcasting system based on <b>our</b> periodic <b>broadcast</b> scheme called Striping <b>Broadcast.</b> <b>Our</b> experience with the system confirms that the system offers a low service delay close to its analytical guaranteed delay while requiring small storage space and low download bandwidth at a client...|$|R
