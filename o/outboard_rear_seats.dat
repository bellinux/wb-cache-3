40|$|Abstract. Seat {{pressure}} {{is known as}} a major factor of seat comfort in vehicles. In passenger vehicles, there is lacking research into the <b>seat</b> comfort of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants. As accurate seat pressure measurement requires significant effort, simulation of seat {{pressure is}} evolving as a preferred method. However, analytic methods are based on complex finite element modeling and therefore are time consuming and involve high investment. Based on accurate anthropometric measurements of 64 male sub-jects and <b>outboard</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> pressure measurements in three different passenger vehicles, this study investigates if a set of pa-rameters derived from seat pressure mapping are sensitive enough to differentiate between different seats and whether they correlate with anthropometry in linear models. In addition to the pressure map analysis, H-Points were measured with a coor-dinate measurement system based on palpated body landmarks and the range of H-Point locations in the three seats is pro-vided. It was found that for the cushion, cushion contact area and cushion front area/force could be modeled by subject anthro-pometry, while only seatback contact area could be modeled based on anthropometry for all three vehicles. Major {{differences were found between the}} vehicles for other parameters...|$|R

50|$|The 1980s saw {{relatively}} few {{changes to the}} Country Squire. In 1983 the carbureted engine was replaced with throttle body fuel injection. For the 1986 Model year, Ford went to sequential multi-port fuel injection which is identifiable by the large intake with the EFI 5.0 badge on top. In 1988, coinciding with the facelift of its LTD Crown Victoria counterpart, the Country Squire received a new front clip. Inside, new front seats with larger head restraints were added. For 1990 and 1991, the dashboard was updated (for {{the first time since}} 1979) {{with the addition of a}} driver's side airbag; the <b>outboard</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> received 3-point seatbelts.|$|E
40|$|Lap belts, {{fitted to}} cenve seats of Ausvalian cars {{for the past}} fifteen years, have come under {{criticism}} as being injurious to children. The weight of evidence is that they provide substantial protection, though less than three point belts. A specific injury, the seat belt syndrome (SBS), to abdominal viscera and/or lumbar spine, {{has been associated with}} lap belts, an association confirmed by IWO studies in Melbourne. The incidence of SBS was calculated from Transport Accident Commission claims. The centre rear seat (lap belt) carried three times the risk of SBS as <b>outboard</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> (three point belts) which in turn have 2. 7 times the risk of the outboard front seat. The number of SBS cases in Victoria has increased with penetration of the fleet by post 1971 cars. The annual estimated number of cases, for 1987, is 186 adults and ten children. Suggestions are made for irnprovcrnents in the restraint system...|$|E
40|$|Methods—During 1988 – 96, {{fatalities}} to <b>rear</b> <b>outboard</b> <b>seat</b> {{occupants of}} passenger cars, classified by age of occupant and vehicle curb weight were matched to data on model {{year in which}} shoulder belts became standard equipment. The same data {{were obtained from the}} same years on back seat occupants in crashes from the Crashworthiness Data System. Weighted regression was performed on death rates per occupants in crashes by belt equipment, occupant age, and vehicle weight for all occupants and occupants who claimed to be restrained...|$|R
40|$|Though a {{significant}} {{body of literature}} exists on the safety performance and effectiveness of various types of front seat occupant restraint systems, there is a paucity of data {{on the performance of}} <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupant restraint systems. A research program was initiated to better understand <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> restraint performance. Research included examining real world data using National Automotive Sampling System/Crashworthiness Data System (NASS/CDS) and Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) as well as conducting full frontal vehicle crashes into rigid barriers with dummies restrained in <b>rear</b> <b>seats.</b> Child dummies (Hybrid III 6 year-old) and adult dummies (Hybrid III 5 th percentile female and 50 th percentile male) were used for this purpose. The dummies were placed in <b>rear</b> <b>outboard</b> <b>seats</b> with lap/shoulder belts {{as well as in the}} center seating position where the lap/shoulder belts were integrated to the seat. A double-paired comparison study using FARS data files suggested that while occupants younger than 50 years of age benefit from sitting in <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> in frontal crashes, restrained adult occupants older than 50 years are significantly better off in the front <b>seats</b> than the <b>rear</b> <b>seats.</b> The most injured body region for restrained children in <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> is the head while that for restrained adults is the thorax. The major injury source for restrained occupants, not in child safety seats, is the seat belts while that for unrestrained occupants is the front seat back. The injury measures of restrained adult dummies in <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> in frontal crash tests were generally higher than those of dummies of the same size in the driver and front passenger seat. The seat backs of integrated <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> experienced excessive forward rotation in frontal crash tests, thereby causing the dummy’s head to hit the console or front seatback, resulting in high head and neck injury measures. The field and vehicle crash test data indicate that <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> restraints could be further optimized to mitigate injury in frontal crashes for older <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants...|$|R
50|$|In September 2004 for the 2005 model year, the FX range {{received}} enhancements such as {{lane departure warning}} (LDW) {{system that}} helps alert drivers to an unintended movement of the vehicle out of a designated traffic lane. Infiniti's system monitored the lane markings to alert passengers via an audible buzzer that the driver is drifting unintentionally. The LDW system, which utilize a small camera, speed sensor, an indicator and an audible warning buzzer, was offered on models. The Infiniti FX was the first passenger vehicle to offer a lane departure warning system in the United States market. In addition to LDW, the 2005 Infiniti FX range was now equipped with standard roof-mounted curtain supplemental curtain air bags with rollover protection for front and <b>rear</b> <b>outboard</b> <b>seat</b> occupants.|$|R

500|$|The 2011 Chevrolet Volt {{standard}} {{features include}} 4-wheel anti-lock brakes with traction control; StabiliTrak electronic {{stability control system}} with brake assist; tire-pressure monitoring system; and 8 total airbags: dual-stage frontal, side-impact and knee for driver and front passenger, and roof-rail side-impact for front and <b>rear</b> <b>outboard</b> <b>seating</b> positions, with a passenger sensing system. There is also available an optional emergency assistance system. A safety cage, built with high-strength and ultra high-strength steel, surrounds the passenger compartment to keep the space intact {{in the event of}} a crash. Crush zones framing the trunk and the engine crumple to absorb crash energy before it reaches occupants. Door hinges and latches in harmony with door structure and its steel reinforcements to keep doors closed during an impact. The 2011 Chevrolet Volt was named [...] "Top Safety Pick" [...] by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Volt received the top ratings of [...] "Good" [...] for front, side, and rear impact crash tests, and also on rollover protection.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the noise {{performance}} for the seat adjuster mechanism, noise and vibration measurements were conducted in both European and Australian cars for six and eight modes of the seat adjustment operations on the driver's seat. The six modes of the driver's seat operations are: both up for the front and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> ends, both down for the front and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> ends, front seat end up, front <b>seat</b> end down, <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> end up and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> end down.

40|$|Lap and {{shoulder}} belts {{have been required}} in <b>rear</b> <b>outboard</b> positions since 1989. A recent congressional mandate encouraged the requirement of a lap {{and shoulder}} belt in the center <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> position. This study utilized Data from the Partners for Child Passenger Safety study, a large-scale child-focused crash surveillance system, to quantify changes in seating patterns for children in vehicles that already have this feature compared to those which do not and measured the safety benefit associated with the provision of a shoulder belt in the center <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> position. The data demonstrate {{that the presence of}} a shoulder belt in the center <b>rear</b> <b>seating</b> position influences seating practices only when there is a single child occupant in the vehicle. Belted children in the center rear of vehicles equipped with a lap shoulder belt are at an 81 % reduction in risk of injury than those belted in the center rear equipped with a lap only belt. The data suggest that by requiring lap shoulder belts in the center rear, benefits would be realized to belted children, specifically the 4 – 8 year old group...|$|R
40|$|This project {{helped to}} {{identify}} priorities {{for improving the}} safety of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants through a literature review and NASS-CDS injury analysis. The literature review covers injury patterns of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants, new safety technologies intended for the <b>rear</b> <b>seat,</b> studies of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> belt and seat geometry, and methods for assessing belt fit; key points follow. Most rear-seat cushion lengths exceed the recommended length of 440 mm intended for accommodating adults. Since children make up 70 % of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants, built-in booster seats with shorter cushion lengths designed to accommodate children aged 5 - 8 would be beneficial. Front seats tend to have steeper outboard lap-belt angles, more forward shoulder belt anchors, and narrower spacing between lap belt anchorages than in the rear seat; target lap belt angles in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> should range from 45 to 70 degrees. Booster seats are potentially more effective at mitigating poor lap belt geometry than poor shoulder belt geometry, so improving shoulder belt geometry in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> should have higher priority. Load limiters, seatbelt pretensioners, and inflatable belt systems are potential countermeasures for reducing thoracic injury for <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants. If load limiters are installed in <b>rear</b> <b>seats,</b> the amount of available space for occupant displacement would be more important to consider in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> than in the front seat. The NASS-CDS database was first used to identify rear-row occupant seating patterns. In the second row, adults tend {{to sit on the}} right side, but this is not true for children. Vans are the only vehicle type with substantial numbers of 3 rd row seating. The ages of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupant vary substantially with driver age. Drivers aged 16 - 25 most likely have other 16 - 25 YO or 0 - 4 YO occupants in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b> For drivers aged 26 - 50, 85 % of their <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants are under aged 16. Drivers over age 50 have the greatest proportion of passengers over age 50 in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b> From the injury analysis, <b>seating</b> in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> is protective in terms of fatality and injury reduction, regardless of restraint use, except for rear impacts. The back of the front seat is a common injury contact point for rear-seat occupants. Studies of belt restraints have seldom found a difference in effectiveness between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b> Most common injury contact points in side impact for belted children are on the lower rear quarter of the rear window. The presence of other occupants in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> provides some benefit in injury reduction for children involved in side impacts, possibly by limiting lateral movement. Pediatric abdominal injury patterns indicate that the <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> of minivans provide an environment with lower risk of abdomen injury compared to the back seats of passenger cars and SUVs. Pediatric injury rates are similar for children riding in SUVs and passenger cars, as potential benefits of a heavier vehicle are offset by a greater tendency to be in rollovers. Presence of a three-point belt rather than a lap-only belt reduces pediatric risk of AIS 2 + injury by 81 %. The presence of a shoulder belt in the center <b>rear</b> <b>seating</b> position usually only affects seating practices when there is a single child occupant in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat...</b>|$|R

40|$|Major {{gains in}} {{occupant}} protection in automotive crashes {{have been made}} {{over the past few}} decades, with the introduction of technologies such as airbags and seat belt pretensioners. However, the focus, both in terms of regulation and consumer testing, has been on front <b>seat</b> occupants. With <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants being over-represented in vehicle fatalities, {{there is a need to}} examine protection offered to those who sit in the back seat of motor vehicles. This thesis consists of six inter-related studies focused on characterising the rates and biomechanical mechanisms of the injury to <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants (not using child restraints), and evaluations of both existing and novel technologies for improving injury outcomes for <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants. The methods used include in-depth crash investigation and crash sled testing, with a focus on children aged 8 - 16 and older occupants. The results of these studies indicate that substantial casualty savings in <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants might be achieved through the implementation of existing technology to front seat occupants. While the results of the in-depth crash investigation demonstrated that injury mechanisms differ between front and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants, it was found from sled testing that tailoring existing technologies to meet the needs of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants, such as younger and older occupants, may substantially improve <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupant protection.
