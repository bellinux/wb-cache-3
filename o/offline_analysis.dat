5000|$|If {{a system}} drive, or a {{partition}} on it, has been encrypted with TrueCrypt, then only {{the data on}} that partition is deniable. When the TrueCrypt boot loader replaces the normal boot loader, an <b>offline</b> <b>analysis</b> of the drive can positively determine that a TrueCrypt boot loader is present and so lead to the logical inference that a TrueCrypt partition is also present. Even though there are features to obfuscate its purpose (i.e. displaying a BIOS-like message to misdirect an observer such as, [...] "Non-system disk" [...] or [...] "disk error"), these reduce the functionality of the TrueCrypt boot loader and do not hide {{the content of the}} TrueCrypt boot loader from <b>offline</b> <b>analysis.</b> Here again, the use of a hidden operating system is the suggested method for retaining deniability.|$|E

50|$|CookieCadger is a Java app that automates sidejacking and {{replay of}} {{insecure}} HTTP GET requests. Cookie Cadger helps identify information leakage from applications that utilize insecure HTTP GET requests. Web providers have started {{stepping up to}} the plate since Firesheep was released in 2010. Today, most major websites can provide SSL/TLS during all transactions, preventing cookie data from leaking over wired Ethernet or insecure Wi-Fi. Cookie Cadger is the first open-source pen-testing tool ever made for intercepting and replaying specific insecure HTTP GET requests into a browser. Cookie Cadger is a graphical utility which harnesses the power of the Wireshark suite and Java to provide a fully cross-platform, entirely open-source utility which can monitor wired Ethernet, insecure Wi-Fi, or load a packet capture file for <b>offline</b> <b>analysis.</b> Cookie Cadger has been used to highlight the weaknesses of youth team sharing sites such as Shutterfly (used by AYSO soccer league) and TeamSnap.|$|E
50|$|Report mining is the {{extraction}} of data from human readable computer reports. Conventional data extraction requires a connection to a working source system, suitable connectivity standards or an API, and usually complex querying. By using the source system's standard reporting options, and directing the output to a spool file instead of to a printer, static reports can be generated suitable for <b>offline</b> <b>analysis</b> via report mining. This approach can avoid intensive CPU usage during business hours, can minimise end-user licence costs for ERP customers, and can offer very rapid prototyping and development of custom reports. Whereas data scraping and web scraping involve interacting with dynamic output, report mining involves extracting data from files in a human readable format, such as HTML, PDF, or text. These can be easily generated from almost any system by intercepting the data feed to a printer. This approach can provide a quick and simple route to obtaining data without needing to program an API to the source system.|$|E

40|$|Functional MRI (fMRI) shows {{areas of}} the brain that are active during a task, but the {{standard}} approach (<b>offline</b> <b>analysis</b> after the imaging has finished) precludes tailoring of the imaging to the individual patient, e. g. for assessing normal function around an individual lesion. The aims of the study were to explore the technical feasibility of acquiring functional images in real-time (rt-fMRI), develop the necessary software interfaces and protocols for image acquisition, and to compare images of functional activation acquired in real-time with the standard offline statistical parametric method in patients with solitary brain tumours. Patients with a solitary supratentorial lesion were studied. The rt-fMRI paradigms were sequential finger opposition, ankle movement and language function (correct recognition of grammatically violated sentences). Datasets were analysed using AFNI software (National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) for the real-time analysis and SPM 99 (Functional Imaging Laboratory, University College, London, UK) for the <b>offline</b> <b>analysis.</b> From 11 patients, useful data were obtained in nine. The finger tapping task produced most consistent activation between real-time and <b>offline</b> <b>analysis</b> with good anatomic localization to the primary motor cortex contralateral to the tapping finger. Ankle movement produced weaker activation and correlation with real-time analysis. For the language task the <b>offline</b> <b>analysis</b> provided reproducible activation patterns, but the real-time method showed no activation at the chosen threshold of p = 0. 001. Tumourous areas of brain did not show any activation with either method of analysis during any task. rt-fMRI is feasible and could be a valuable functional evaluation tool in the planning of surgery for tumours in motor regions of the brain. Further paradigm development is required for evaluation of language, and possibly other more complex executive functions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{framework}} for grasp planning with a humanoid robot arm and a five-fingered hand. The aim is to provide the humanoid robot with the ability of grasping objects that appear in a kitchen environment. Our approach {{is based on the}} use of an object model database that contains the description of all the objects that can appear in the robot workspace. This database is completed with two modules that make use of this object representation: An exhaustive <b>offline</b> grasp <b>analysis</b> system and a real-time stereo vision system. The <b>offline</b> grasp <b>analysis</b> system determines the best grasp for the objects by employing a simulation system, together with CAD models of the objects and the five-fingered hand. The results of this analysis are added to the object database using a description suited to the requirements of the grasp execution modules. A stereo camera system is used for a real-time object localization using a combination of appearance-based and modelbased methods. The different components are integrated in a controller architecture to achieve manipulation task goals for the humanoid robot. I...|$|R
