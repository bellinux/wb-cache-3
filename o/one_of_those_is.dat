500|$|In December 2010, {{following}} Gary Speed's {{departure from}} the job as manager of Sheffield United for the position as the head coach of Wales, Adams {{was one of a}} handful of names linked to the vacant position at United. On Christmas Eve, Vale chairman Bill Bratt announced he had [...] "reluctantly" [...] given Adams permission to talk to Sheffield United. Six days later it was announced that he would be taking the position, and he announced his three aims as manager would be to firstly avoid relegation, to then challenge for promotion, and finally [...] "to develop a structure that will build us a reputation for home grown talent that fans can be proud of in their team". Former United player Alan Cork was installed as his assistant, Cork had worked as Adams' assistant at Fulham, Swansea, Leicester and Coventry. The fourth manager at the club that season, he brought in Dave Bassett in a consultancy role after finding managing the club a bigger task than he had previously assumed. As Adams explained: [...] "When you're manager at Port Vale you probably get three calls a day and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>is</b> from the wife asking me what time I'm coming home for my tea." [...] His honeymoon period dissipated quickly, as United failed to win in his first eleven games in charge (four draws and seven defeats) and slipped into 23rd spot after letting slip a two-goal lead to lose 3–2 to fellow relegation strugglers Scunthorpe United. Adams told the press that [...] "The fans were singing 'you're not fit to wear the shirt', I cannot disagree with them. That is as disappointing a result as I have ever had in my career." [...] It took three months before he achieved his first win. The victory came on 8 March 2011 (his fourteenth game in charge), as his side came from behind to beat Nottingham Forest 2–1. Sheffield United were relegated to League One at the end of the season, finishing six points short of safety. Adams and United parted company after a meeting with owner Kevin McCabe. McCabe stated that he wished to initiate a [...] "clean sweep at the top and start afresh"; whilst Adams said that whilst he was [...] "very, very disappointed with the decision... I am a Blade and will always be a Blade." ...|$|E

[...] Phil Coomes, writing for BBC News in 2013, said [...] "For those of us interested in street photography there are a few names that stand out and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>is</b> Garry Winogrand, whose pictures of New York in the 1960s are a photographic lesson in every frame." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} he said, [...] "Part {{of it was}} an objective goal to make the character memorable, since it seems that every character that has been successful has {{had some kind of}} unique weapon, whether it be a chain saw or a machete, etc. I was also looking for a primal fear which is embedded in the subconscious of people of all cultures. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>is</b> the fear of teeth being broken, which I used in my first film. Another is the claw of an animal, like a saber-toothed tiger reaching with its tremendous hooks. I transposed this into a human hand. The original script had the blades being fishing knives." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{remaining}} {{objects in}} the Mildenhall assemblage are all small eating utensils; five round-bowled ladles or spoons, and eight long-handled spoons of the common late-Roman cochlear type. [...] The round 'ladles' have zoomorphic handles cast {{in the form of}} dolphins. [...] There is a comparable piece in the Traprain treasure, and there are two sets each of ten ladles of this type, though not with zoomorphic handles, in the Hoxne hoard. [...] Only four handles survive from the Mildenhall ladles, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>is</b> broken and incomplete. [...] Because handles and bowls were soldered together in antiquity and had separated during burial, it is not certain which handle belongs to which bowl. [...] In theory, if each component bowl and each handle were from a different utensil, there could have been as many as 9 ladles originally. [...] In practice, it seems more likely that the handles and bowls present all belong together, and the group has therefore been reconstructed as five ladles, combining the existing handles and bowls.|$|E
