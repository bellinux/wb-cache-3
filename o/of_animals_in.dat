5|$|Animal Rights Without Liberation: Applied Ethics and Human Obligations is a 2012 book by the British {{political}} theorist Alasdair Cochrane, {{in which}} it is argued that animal rights philosophy can be decoupled from animal liberation philosophy by the adoption of the interest-based rights approach. Cochrane, arguing that there is no reason that (nonhuman) animals should be excluded from justice, adopts Joseph Raz's account of interest rights and extends it to include animals. He argues that sentient animals possess a right not to be made to suffer and a right not to be killed, but not a right to freedom. The book's chapters apply Cochrane's account to a number of interactions between humans and animals; first animal experimentation, then animal agriculture, the genetic engineering of animals, the use <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> entertainment and sport, the relationship of animals to environmental practices and the use <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> cultural practices.|$|E

5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats and mice, which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E
5|$|After much delay (two of its ten members {{died and}} several fell ill), the {{commission}} reported its findings in March 1912.

It also recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment of a committee to advise the Secretary of State on matters related to the Cruelty to Animals Act.

5|$|Bal Gangadhar Tilak has {{credited}} Jainism {{with the}} cessation of slaughter <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> the brahamanical religion. Some scholars have traced the origin of Ahimsa to Jains and their precursor, the sramanas. According to Thomas McEvilley, a noted Indologist, certain seals of Indus Valley civilisation depict a meditative figure surrounded by a multitude of wild animals, providing evidence of proto yoga tradition in India akin to Jainism. This particular image might suggest that all the animals depicted are sacred to this particular practitioner. Consequently, these animals would be protected from harm.|$|E

5|$|Most {{animals are}} euthanized after {{being used in}} an experiment. Sources of {{laboratory}} animals vary between countries and species; most animals are purpose-bred, while a minority {{are caught in the}} wild or supplied by dealers who obtain them from auctions and pounds. Supporters of the use <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> experiments, such as the British Royal Society, argue that virtually every medical achievement in the 20th century relied on the use <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> some way. The Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of the United States National Academy of Sciences has argued that animal research cannot be replaced by even sophisticated computer models, which are unable to deal with the extremely complex interactions between molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organisms and the environment. Animal rights and some animal welfare organizations—such as PETA and BUAV—question the need for and legitimacy of animal testing, arguing that it is cruel and poorly regulated, that medical progress is actually held back by misleading animal models that cannot reliably predict effects in humans, that some of the tests are outdated, that the costs outweigh the benefits, or that animals have the intrinsic right not to be used or harmed in experimentation.|$|E

5|$|Opposition {{to the use}} <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> medical {{research}} first arose in the United States during the 1860s, when Henry Bergh founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), with America's first specifically anti-vivisection organization being the American AntiVivisection Society (AAVS), founded in 1883. Antivivisectionists of the era generally believed the spread of mercy was the great cause of civilization, and vivisection was cruel. However, in the USA the antivivisectionists' efforts were defeated in every legislature, overwhelmed by the superior organization and influence of the medical community. Overall, this movement had little legislative success until {{the passing of the}} Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, in 1966.|$|E
