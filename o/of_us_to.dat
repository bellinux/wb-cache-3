5|$|The census {{report of}} 2010 Zambian census was {{released}} {{during the first}} week of March 2013 by Fredson Yamba, Secretary to the Treasury of the Government of Zambia. He quoted that “Population is our most valuable resource and we can only take stock of it through an activity like the census. We now have the data, therefore, the challenge remains with all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> ensure it is put into good use by making informed decisions for our people,”. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) helped the Government of Zambia, especially the Child Welfare Ministry to update the data from the Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS) and data on all key performance indicators of the National Development Plan (ZNDP) during 2013.|$|E
5|$|Joel is {{voiced by}} veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Ellie is voiced by actress Ashley Johnson. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology; approximately 85% of the game's animations were recorded using motion capture, with remaining audio elements recorded {{later in a}} studio. Though the team quickly felt that Johnson fit the role of Ellie, they spent more time selecting the actor of Joel, as the chemistry between the two characters was imperative to the game. After Baker and Johnson played alongside each other, the team realised that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel, despite the actor's young age. Druckmann attributed Baker's voice and movement to the team's choice of casting him. Baker and Johnson contributed greatly {{to the development of}} the characters. For example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann to re-write the character of Ellie in a stronger and more defensive manner. Some of the dialogue between the duo was improvised by the actors; Druckmann attributed this to the fact that the script included an unnecessary number of lines during gameplay sections, and he allowed the actors to choose what they felt was necessary. The characters of Joel and Ellie were the basis of the game; the development between the characters was established first, and the game's other concepts followed. From the beginning of development, the team intended for The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>to</b> feature dual protagonists with strong individual story arcs. During the Winter segment of the game, players assume control of Ellie. The developers ensured that this change was kept secretive prior to the game's release, to surprise players; they did the same with Ellie's immunity, as well as with the game's prologue, where players assume control of Joel's daughter Sarah. The change of control from Joel to Ellie signifies a change in the role of the protector, echoing Druckmann's previous ideas as a student. The character interactions were inspired by the relationship between Nathan Drake and Tenzin in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, in turn inspired by the video game Ico. The game's protagonists represent the two eras that are shown in the game; Joel represents the world before the outbreak, having spent most of his life during this period, while Ellie represents the world after the outbreak, as she was born in the post-apocalyptic world. While the former is emotionally damaged due to the loss that he has experienced, the latter maintains an optimistic view of life, having become familiar to the damaged world; spending time with each other saw these qualities overlapping, with Joel become more lively, and Ellie learning more survival skills.|$|E

(Donald {{is by far the most}} popular Disney cartoon in Sweden.) This one-hour show mostly contains clips from classical Disney films, such as Robin Hood and The Jungle Book (with the song The Bear Necessities), as well as promotional clips for recent Disney films, concluded with the song When You Wish Upon A Star. The show is one of the highest-rated Swedish television programs, only rivalled by international sports events and the Eurovision Song Contest, and most Swedish people can recite much of the show.|$|E
25|$|Nationalists deplore {{the fact}} that so many people are {{stateless}} or live under inefficient and tyrannical regimes. Advocates of the society of states are concerned about rogue states and about the imperial ambitions of the powerful. Cosmopolitans believe that the contemporary world badly fails to live up to their standards, and that doing so would require considerable changes in the actions of wealthy individuals and states. It might, for instance, require them to transfer most of their wealth to the poor. It might require the building of international institutions able to limit, or even replace, the self-interested action of powerful states and corporations. It might require each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do much more than most now do.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, a {{memorial}} {{was created in}} Stockholm to honor Wallenberg.

At the unveiling, King Carl XVI Gustaf said Wallenberg is [...] "a great example {{to those of us}} who want to live as fellow humans". Kofi Annan praised him as [...] "an inspiration for all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> act when we can and to have the courage to help those who are suffering and in need of help". The memorial's design (see photo) has been considered inappropriate by some critics.|$|E

Acheson formed a working group under the United States National Security Council (NSC) executive secretary Sidney Souers, consisting of R. Gordon Arneson, Paul Nitze and Fisher, who served as the State Department's legal adviser on the project. It was Arneson's view that each member of the working group were of one mind. He said, [...] "The four principals in the State Department were Acheson, Nitze, Fisher and myself.

500|$|Before Selena signed her {{contract}} with EMI Latin in 1989, Behar and Stephen Finfer requested Selena for an English-language debut album. She {{was asked to}} make three demonstration recordings for Charles Koppelman, chairman of EMI Records. After reviewing them, Koppelman declined a crossover attempt, believing Selena should first strengthen her fan base. In a 2007 interview, Behar spoke about the difficulty of recording Selena's English-language debut. He said EMI [...] "had let all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> believe that she would record in English, and it just wasn't materializing for whatever reason". Behar said the record company [...] "didn't believe, they didn't think it could happen", and continuously told Selena and her father [...] "it wasn't the right time" [...] for an English-language debut.|$|E

[...] As Cobain did more interviews, he changed his explanation of the song and rarely gave specifics about the song's meaning.

500|$|From 2005 to 2011, the Club {{was under}} the {{direction}} of Paul Rardin. Notable achievements during this time include international tours to Spain in 2008 and Cuba in 2011. The Cuban tour was considered especially significant, given that Americans have not easily been able to travel to the country legally, but the University gave financial assistance and an offer of a cultural exchange to make the tour happen. In 2010, the club celebrated its 150th anniversary, and as part of the celebrations performed a set of joint concerts with the Harvard University and University of Virginia Glee Clubs, taking a variety of music including contemporary American songs, folk and Renaissance music. Rardin said [...] "It's a wonderful opportunity for all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> see, hear and learn from three different ensembles." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} {{discussing}} the religious themes in Harrison's songwriting, Allison qualifies the literal message of [...] "Be Here Now" [...] by stating, [...] "this song {{must be understood}} as an endorsement [...] ", yet it is [...] "hardly the typical George". Allison cites a number of compositions from throughout Harrison's career, all covering issues of karma and reincarnation, as evidence that Harrison [...] "encourages all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> ponder our inescapable end and so imagine the future", rather than focusing only on the here and now. Harrison {{would return to the}} specific theme of [...] "Be Here Now" [...] in later songs such as [...] "Flying Hour" [...] and [...] "Just for Today", the last of which adopts the here-and-now message as an inspirational statement for members of Alcoholics Anonymous.|$|E
500|$|Maeser had a {{profound}} effect on his students. One of them, Alice Louise Reynolds, wrote that [...] "he had the ability to inspire.

[...] Among the students who studied under Maeser were George Sutherland, William H. King, Bryant S. Hinckley, James E. Talmage, George Albert Smith and J. Golden Kimball. He also inspired his family members; one of his sons, Karl Emil, studied under Maeser and went on to be a respected educator and school president. Maeser retired from Brigham Young Academy in 1892 to devote his time to his position as the Superintendent of Church Schools. He was succeeded by Benjamin Cluff.|$|E

[...] "Due care is a duty imposed on each one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> protect society from unnecessary danger, not to protect A, B or C alone... In an empty world, negligence would not exist. It does involve a relationship between man and his fellows. But not merely a relationship between man and those whom he might reasonably expect his act would injure.

Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|E

Other scenes cut out explained that the teenage Kirk stole his stepfather's antique car because he had forced him to clean it before an auction; and that the Orion he seduced at the Academy worked in the operations division.

Number nine on the list was: [...] "Remember, America, I gave you the Internet, and I can take it away!" [...] In 2005 when Gore was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award [...] "for three decades of {{contributions}} to the Internet" [...] at the Webby Awards he joked in his acceptance speech (limited to five words according to Webby Awards rules): [...] "Please don't recount this vote."

Matt Thorne noted that while he found Gibson's tendency towards hyper-specificity initially irritating, [...] "there's hypnotic quality to the relentless cataloguing". The author's prose was also extolled by Clay Evans of the Daily Camera, and by Benjamin Lytal in The New York Sun, who declared that [...] "the real news, in Spook Country, is {{that much of the}} flair that Mr. Gibson once brought to descriptions of cyberspace seems to fit perfectly, now, on all kinds of things."
