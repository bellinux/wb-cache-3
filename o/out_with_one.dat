5|$|Marty (Eddie Jones) is {{a former}} boxer, now {{a high school teacher}} and boxing trainer/manager who had {{previously}} coached a fighter to a title shot, only to have the fighter leave him just before the fight. Marty and his business partner Diane (Diane Tayler) arrive at the gym where Tommy spars to scout his sparring partner. The fighter's manager instructs Tommy to make his fighter look good, but after he suffers a low blow, Tommy knocks the fighter <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> punch. The manager and the gym's owner angrily order Tommy from the gym but Marty and Diane chase after him, inviting him to train with Marty.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} the {{propulsion}} plant, {{which was to be}} built in the Netherlands, was taking shape. Requirements sent out in August 1939 mandated that the ships have eight boiler rooms, four sets of geared turbines, and 180,000shp. After further improvements, Nevesbu and two German firms (Germaniawerft was responsible for the turbines and Deschimag for the boilers) began sketching preliminary plans. These were then incorporated into two different design studies, one by Nevesbu and the other by NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (IvS). IvS was purportedly a Dutch company linking Dutch and German designers, but in reality functioned as a front company for German interests. Their design was probably based upon a set of plans drawn up by the Ship Construction Office of the German Navy and received in the Netherlands on 31 August. It did not give the propulsion machinery enough space, and it was thought that this design did not provide enough room for magazines. Nevertheless, it was taken into discussions with the Dutch, where the 11 July design was merged with it. IvS came <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> further plan on 11 March 1940, the merits of which were discussed with the Dutch in April of that year.|$|E
5|$|Natalya, {{along with}} the other Hart Dynasty members, {{appeared}} at WrestleMania XXVI, helping her uncle Bret Hart during his match against Vince McMahon, turning them into faces as a result. On April 26, The Hart Dynasty won the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship from The Miz and The Big Show. The following day, as part of the 2010 WWE Supplemental Draft, Natalya was drafted to the Raw brand, along with Kidd and Smith. On the May 24, 2010, episode of Raw, all three members of The Hart Dynasty were attacked by The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso) and Tamina, who were making their debuts. This provoked a feud between the trios, with The Hart Dynasty attacking The Usos and Tamina the following week in retaliation. At the Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view in June, Natalya and The Hart Dynasty defeated Tamina and The Uso brothers in a six-person mixed tag team match, when Natalya pinned Tamina following a discus clothesline. At the next pay-per-view, Money in the Bank, Natalya helped The Hart Dynasty to retain the championship against The Usos by stopping Tamina from interfering in the match, ending the feud. In September, at Night of Champions, The Hart Dynasty lost the Tag Team Championship in a Tag Team Turmoil match. After a failed attempt to regain the championship, in which Kidd was pushed off balance during their double-team Hart Attack move, Kidd and Smith began to have a falling <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> another.|$|E

5|$|One {{young man}} kicked and smashed {{the window of}} a police car, lit a pack of matches, and set the {{upholstery}} on fire. After burning for a short time, the fuel tank exploded; a dozen more police cars and eight other automobiles would be destroyed in a similar fashion. The photo on the front cover of the Dead Kennedys 1980 album Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables, which shows several police cars on fire, was taken that night. Several crowd members threw tear gas, which they had stolen from police vehicles. Riots began to break <b>out,</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> mob disrupting traffic. Electric trollies were disabled when their overhead wires were pulled down, and violence broke out against the police officers, who were outnumbered. Police Chief Charles Gain, standing inside City Hall, ordered officers not to attack and to simply stand their ground.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Australia, Brown scored 1,057 runs at 105.70 in the 1938â€“39 Australian season, including 990 at 110.00 in six Sheffield Shield matches. Brown started the season well, scoring 84 as Queensland amassed 501 against New South Wales. His old state were still 27 runs from making Queensland bat again, but time ran <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> wicket intact, with Brown yet to taste victory {{with his new}} state. Nevertheless, he continued to perform strongly as passed 50 {{in each of his}} first four innings. In the fourth of these, he was out for 99 and then declared at 5/510 to leave Victoria a victory target of 319. Brown then narrowly missed out on a milestone {{for the second time in}} the match when Victoria scraped home by three wickets to deny him a maiden victory with his home state. In the next match, he carried his bat to make an unbeaten 174 against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval, as his team fell to an innings defeat.|$|E

25|$|Birds use a {{combination}} of their beaks and feet to excavate burrow nests. The tunnel is started with the beak; the bird either probes at the ground to create a depression, or flies toward its chosen nest site on a cliff wall and hits it with its bill. The latter method is not without its dangers; there are reports of kingfishers being fatally injured in such attempts. Some birds remove tunnel material with their bills, while others use their bodies or shovel the dirt <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> or both feet. Female paradise-kingfishers are known to use their long tails to clear the loose soil.|$|E
25|$|Removing {{contact lenses}} {{incorrectly}} {{could result in}} damage to the lens and injury to the eye so certain precautions must be taken. Rigid contact lenses can best be removed by pulling the eyelid tight and then blinking, whereupon the lens drops <b>out.</b> <b>With</b> <b>one</b> finger on the outer corner of the eyelids, or lateral canthus, the person stretches the eyelids towards the ear; the increased tension of the eyelid margins {{against the edge of}} lens allows the blink to break the capillary action that adheres the lens to the eye. The other hand is typically cupped underneath the eye to catch the lens as it drops out. For soft lenses, which have a stronger adherence to the eye surface, this technique is less suitable.|$|E
25|$|Though given a title {{shot at the}} IPWA Heavyweight Championship, Jackson {{announced}} that he would be unable to compete and offered an open invitation to anyone who wished to take his spot on the card. Buddy Landel, who had previously given a memorial speech for Junkyard Dog, accepted the offer and faced Jimmy Cicero in a no-disqualification match. Landel was initially disqualified when Cicero intentionally threw himself over the ropes. When the referee awarded Cicero the title however, Jackson came <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> of the posters for the event and pointed out that since his match with Cicero was advertised as a no-DQ bout, so should Landel's. The referee agreed and the match was restarted with Landel eventually pinning Cicero for the title. Later that month, Jackson wrestled Big Slam Vader in Butner, North Carolina.|$|E

25|$|When {{the ring}} enters the crease, the goaltender then has five seconds to throw, pass with stick, deflect, or push the ring out to another player. If the goalie does not pass it within five seconds, the ring is {{awarded to the}} other team for a free pass {{from one of the}} {{defensive}} free play circles. The goalie may use the stick to touch the ring outside the crease, and can also pass through the crease, but may not pull it into the crease unless she pulls it all the way through and <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> motion. Otherwise, this results in a loss of possession, and a penalty if she has already been given a warning. The goalie may not pick up or cover the ring with her glove outside the crease. The goalie can push the ring with a hand when outside the crease, as can any other player.|$|E

The Opus Dei have been trying to destroy the Grail to preserve the credibility of the Vatican.

The group escapes to London via Teabing's private plane, along with his butler, Remy Jean. They travel to the Temple Church, but the clue to unlocking the cryptex is a red herring. Silas is freed by Remy while claiming to be the Teacher and taking Teabing hostage, dumping him in his car's trunk while Silas hides out in an Opus Dei safe house. Teabing poisons Remy and sends the police after Silas, who is shot by police after accidentally wounding Aringarosa, who is promptly arrested by Fache for using him to hunt Langdon.|$|E
25|$|Netherlands {{made more}} {{runs on the}} second day, with van Troost and Edgar Schiferli sharing an Intercontinental Cup record ninth-wicket {{partnership}} worth 95. During the partnership, the Dutch also surpassed the previous highest Intercontinental Cup total, of 444 for 4 between Ireland and UAE. They were eventually bowled out for 474, Schiferli hitting to Collins Obuya for 69, and Kenya {{got a chance to}} bat shortly before tea. They faced 52 second-day overs, with five batsmen making it into double figures, but only captain Steve Tikolo could convert it into a score past 25, as the Dutch snared five wickets. Darron Reekers got the best bowling figures, with two for 28. Reekers failed to take any wickets on the third day, however, when Kenya fought back â€“ they scored 197 runs on that day, for the loss of four wickets (compared to 135 for 5 on the first), with Peter Ongondo lasting {{two and a half hours}} in a 123-run eighth-wicket stand with Tikolo. Netherlands then got two wickets in successive overs, and Kenya were 315 for 9, nine short of the follow on with the injured Modi still in the pavilion.

25|$|Uncharted 2 is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{video game}} played from a third-person view, with the player {{in control of}} Nathan Drake. Drake is physically adept {{and is able to}} jump, climb, and scale narrow ledges and wall-faces to get between points. Drake can be equipped with up to two firearms â€“ one single-handed and one two-handed â€“ and a limited supply of grenades. Drake can pick up weapons, automatically replacing the existing weapon he was using, and additional ammunition from slain enemies. The player can direct Drake to take cover behind corners or low walls using either aimed or blind-fire to kill his enemies. The player can also have Drake fire while moving. If Drake is undetected by his enemies, the player can attempt to use stealth to take them out, such as by sneaking up behind them to knock them <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> hit, or by pulling an unsuspecting foe over a ledge from which Drake is hanging. In most areas, if all of the foes patrolling are killed stealthily then other waves that would normally appear do not. Some areas of the game require the player to solve puzzles with the use of Drake's journal, which provides clues towards the puzzles' solutions. When enabled, a hint system provides gameplay clues, such as the direction of the next objective.|$|E
25|$|For the Wednesday {{night game}} at the Big 10's Ohio State, the Cougars looked to have finally found their scoring touch, even if the defense started out on shaky, wet ground. OSU's first shot was a rocket off a {{crossing}} pass that was too fast for Dal Santo to reach, giving the Buckeyes the 1â€“0 lead in the 8th minute. Ten minutes later, Ebbesen headed a midfield pass to former Buckeye Solawa, who fired it through to Jambga, who was racing toward the goal and fired a 16-foot shot {{into the back of}} the net, upping the score to 1â€“1. On a 27th minute corner kick, an OSU header, only their second shot on goal, eluded Dal Santo to put the home team back in the lead 2â€“1. As the clock wound down on the first half, the Cougars earned a corner kick of their own; on a classic Kendall-Moullin high-pass-to-a-leaping-crowd, Gabe Christianson headed the ball into the net with 7 seconds remaining, for a 2â€“2 score on his first goal since November 2, 2013 after missing two seasons with injuries. The Buckeyes tried to turn up the heat in the second half, but the Cougar defense returned to its stalwart form, with Dal Santo making three strong saves.As the end of regulation time neared, McHugh sent a back-heel pass to Jambga, who shot hard and low toward the far post from fifteen yards <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> minute left on the clock for what would be the game winner.|$|E
