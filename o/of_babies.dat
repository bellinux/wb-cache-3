No. 0807101020003 The Correlation Between Mother Ability To Taking Care <b>Of</b> <b>Baby</b> With Health Problem <b>Of</b> <b>Baby</b> At Puskesmas Montasik Working Territory In Aceh Besar 2012 ABSTRACTBaby ideal {{nursing treatment}} {{was a problem}} that often happened for almost mother who has a <b>baby.</b> Taking care <b>of</b> <b>baby</b> was a responsibillity for every parents especially for mother. Mother with less ability to take care <b>of</b> <b>baby</b> could increase the morbidity rate and even could cause death to the <b>baby.</b> Mother ability <b>of</b> taking care <b>baby</b> can observed from health conditon <b>of</b> the <b>baby.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this research was {{to find out the}} correlation between mother ability to taking care <b>of</b> <b>baby</b> with health problem <b>of</b> <b>baby</b> at Puskesmas Montasik working territory in Aceh Besar. The methode of this research was describtive correlational with cross sectional research design. The sample of this research were 79 responden, selected by using purposive sampling technique using Slovin formula. Data were collected on September 13, 2012 using a quetioner, whose form is Likert and Check list scale for independent variable, and dichotomoise choice scale for dependent variabel. The data were analized univariate and bivariate using chi square test. The result of research showed that there were correlation between mother ability to taking care <b>of</b> the <b>baby,</b> such as from baby skin care aspec(p-value = 0, 002), baby bath care aspect (p-value = 0, 004), baby nutrition care aspect (p-value = 0, 007), baby fullfilment imunization schedule aspect (p-value = 0, 002), taking care <b>of</b> <b>baby</b> sleep behavior (p-value = 0, 009) and taking care <b>of</b> <b>baby</b> safety (p-value = 0, 005). Based on the statistic test result, p-value (0, 001) is less or equal to ? (0, 05), therefor Ho is rejected. Meaning that there was significant correlation between mother ability to take care <b>of</b> <b>baby</b> with health problem <b>of</b> the <b>baby.</b> Its recommended for Health provider to give more attention to increase ability of a mother to take care <b>of</b> <b>baby</b> by giving information or literature in any type to mothers who has baby in rural environtment.

5|$|Developmental effects {{occur at}} very low doses in animals. They include frank {{teratogenicity}} such as cleft palate and hydronephrosis. Development of some organs {{may be even more}} sensitive: very low doses perturb the development of sexual organs in rodents, and the development of teeth in rats. The latter is important in that tooth deformities were also seen after the Seveso accident and possibly after a long breast-feeding <b>of</b> <b>babies</b> in the 1970s and 1980s when the dioxin concentrations in Europe were about ten times higher than at present.|$|E

5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of age, {{and the majority of}} incidents occur {{in the first year of}} life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision <b>of</b> <b>babies</b> reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E

Penile cancer is rare, with about 1 new case per 100,000 people per year in developed countries and higher incidence rates per 100,000 in sub-Saharan Africa (for example: 1.6 in Zimbabwe, 2.7 in Uganda and 3.2 in Swaziland). The number of new cases is also high in certain South American countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay at about 4.3 per 100,000. It is least common in Israeli Jews—0.1 per 100,000—related {{in part to the}} very high rate of circumcision <b>of</b> <b>babies.</b>|$|E

5|$|The battle {{system is}} similar to its predecessor's, with the {{effectiveness}} of an attack dependent on the timing accuracy of separate actions. The battles still consist of turn-based attacks executed by Mario and Luigi, although these are compounded by the babies' actions during an attack. The Bros. movesmoves performed by Mario and Luigi collectivelyhave been replaced by Bros. Items, which are finite attacks that are gained in the overworld. Similar to the Bros. moves, these are more damaging attacks that can be performed by all 4 characters collectively. Only the adults receive damage, even though the babies will become vulnerable once their respective partners have been eliminated from battle. The elimination <b>of</b> <b>babies</b> will also affect battle as some Bros. Items will become disabled, and the party {{will not be able}} to defend itself with hammers, which are wielded exclusively by the babies.|$|E
5|$|There is {{controversy}} {{concerning the}} safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy. While they are not major teratogens, uncertainty remains {{as to whether they}} cause cleft palate in a small number <b>of</b> <b>babies</b> and whether neurobehavioural effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure; they are known to cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness. However, they are less toxic than their predecessors, the barbiturates, and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken. When combined with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as alcoholic drinks and opioids, the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases. Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse.|$|E
5|$|Transmission {{may occur}} via {{consumption}} of contaminated water, or when people share personal objects. In places with {{wet and dry}} seasons, water quality typically worsens during the wet season, and this correlates with the time of outbreaks. In {{areas of the world}} with four seasons, infections are more common in the winter. Bottle-feeding <b>of</b> <b>babies</b> with improperly sanitized bottles is a significant cause on a global scale. Transmission rates are also related to poor hygiene, especially among children, in crowded households, and in those with pre-existing poor nutritional status. After developing tolerance, adults may carry certain organisms without exhibiting signs or symptoms, and thus act as natural reservoirs of contagion. While some agents (such as Shigella) only occur in primates, others may occur {{in a wide variety of}} animals (such as Giardia).|$|E

5|$|Baby {{flying foxes}} usually come into care {{after having been}} {{separated}} from their mothers. Babies are often orphaned during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight. When they are older, orphans usually come into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds <b>of</b> <b>babies</b> at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed flying foxes. Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young flying fox is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it goes into a crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release.|$|E
