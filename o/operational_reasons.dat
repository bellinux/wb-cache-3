5|$|As Apollo 17 was {{the final}} lunar mission of the Apollo program, several {{different}} scientific objectives were identified {{in order to maximize}} the scientific productivity of the mission. Landing sites considered for previous missions, but were rejected were reconsidered. Taurus–Littrow was one of several potential landing sites considered for Apollo 17 along with Tycho crater, Copernicus crater, Tsiolkovskiy crater on the far side, among others. All but Taurus–Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or <b>operational</b> <b>reasons.</b> A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because of the rough terrain found there, a landing on the far side in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and ground control during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as low priority.|$|E

25|$|BEST {{has been}} a quintessential part of life in Mumbai. The red double decker buses, {{modelled}} on the AEC Routemaster buses of London, {{are one of the}} defining characteristics of the city. When BEST decided {{to do away with the}} double-deckers for <b>operational</b> <b>reasons</b> recently, public protests and sentiment forced it to continue with the service. A move to colour all its buses saffron from red in 1997 also drew in criticism, resulting in the red colour being retained. Bus drivers and conductors have come in for praise in the media for their service during the 2005 Mumbai floods, when they ensured that all the stranded passengers were dropped safely to their respective destinations. A total of 900 buses were damaged.|$|E
25|$|Operation Snake Eyes was a {{proposed}} military {{operation of the}} Laotian Civil War. Planned in mid-December 1969 by the U.S. Ambassador to Laos, the planned interdiction of the newly constructed Chinese Road, Route 46, was aimed at halting the road's progress toward the border with Thailand. The offensive by guerrilla raiders was delayed six months for <b>operational</b> <b>reasons.</b> When it was finally ready to be launched, it was pre-empted by the furor caused by the Cambodian Incursion. Fearful that Operation Snake Eyes would arouse even greater publicity, the Central Intelligence Agency handlers of the guerrillas canceled the operation on orders of the White House. Attempts to limit Chinese expansion toward the south would be left to future operations, such as Operation Phalat and Operation Sourisak Montry.|$|E

25|$|When {{a diesel}} {{locomotive}} has been {{attached to the}} train for <b>operational</b> <b>reasons</b> such as assistance on a bank, shunting, or for generation in the heating role, this is also often removed. The locomotive livery may also be changed to simply demonstrate what a locomotive would look like in an alternative, and possibly extinct or never used, livery.

Livery changes or scene reinstatement for smoke removal is often achieved through the use of short term rephotography, where the photographer takes two images at the same site and overlays one onto the other.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, at {{the time}} that the {{operation}} was planned there was no way for the Australian commanders to know when the war would come to an end and there were political and <b>operational</b> <b>reasons</b> to carry out the campaign. By late 1944, the Australian Army had taken a secondary role in the fighting and there was a political need for Australia to demonstrate that it was sharing the burden in the Pacific. As New Guinea was an Australian territory {{at the time}}, it was argued that there was a responsibility to clear the Japanese from that area; however, due to manpower shortages in the Australian economy, the government had requested that the Army find a way to reduce its size, while at the same time requiring it to maintain forces to undertake further operations against the Japanese into 1946. In order to do that, it was argued that there was a requirement to clear the Japanese that had been bypassed in order to allow the garrisons of these areas to be reduced.|$|E

2500|$|Significantly, the Act also {{excluded}} {{employees who}} were dismissed for [...] "genuine <b>operational</b> <b>reasons</b> or reasons including genuine operational reasons".

[...] Interpretation of this clause by the AIRC had created precedent for a broad application of {{this section of the}} Act. In Carter v Village Cinemas, the Full Bench of the AIRC decided upon appeal that an operational reason need only be a reason for dismissal, not the sole or dominant reason for dismissal. In another significant decision, Andrew Cruickshank v Priceline Pty Ltd, Mr Cruickshank was employed at Priceline on a package of $101,150. He was terminated and Priceline subsequently hired a new employee in the same position on a package of $65,000–$75,000. Priceline claimed, successfully, that they had not breached the unfair dismissal provisions of the Act, as the dismissal saved the business money, therefore was for a reason including a genuine operational reason.|$|E

40|$|Electronic {{health record}} systems (EHRs) are {{increasingly}} used to store patient medical information. To ensure the responsible {{use of this}} data, EHRs collect access logs, which record each access to sensitive data (e. g., a patient’s record).

However, in addition to this information, we observe that for various applications such as user-centric auditing, {{it is also important to}} understand why each access occurred. In this paper, we study why accesses occur in EHRs. Our goal is to provide an explanation describing why each access occurred (e. g., Dr. Dave accessed Alice’s medical record because Dr. Dave has an appointment with Alice). Using data from the University of Michigan Health System, we demonstrate that most accesses to EHRs occur for a valid clinical or <b>operational</b> <b>reason,</b> and often the reason is documented in the EHR database.
