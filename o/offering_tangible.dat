Such a contracting as a transaction design implies that customers and suppliers establish a contract-based relationship as a frame for several transactions following up.

This article analyses key barriers and incentives to engaging Hong Kong businesses with voluntary environmental initiatives and compares their relevance for companies of different sizes. As in other countries, SMEs show a much lower uptake of such activities than larger companies. Their approach towards environmental management is predominantly reactive, and legislation remains the key driver for engaging them with environmental change. Inadequate government policy and support, societal attitudes and corporate culture all contribute significantly to the comparatively poor development of corporate environmental management among Hong Kong companies.

For sperm banks to function efficiently, men must understand the implications of unnecessary storage, and make timely decisions about disposal of their own samples. Men who bank sperm prior to cancer treatment are routinely offered follow-up consultations to test their fertility, update consent and, where necessary, expedite referral for Assisted Conception. Yet sperm banks report that men do not respond to letters, suggesting samples are stored needlessly. We conducted semi-structured interviews with six men with a history of not responding to letters, to document reasons for non-response. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Men's reasons for not responding are a complex interplay between past, present and future perspectives. In terms of their past, information is important on diagnosis, because men must understand that fertility can change after treatment. Present and future concerns focus on fears of being told fertility has not recovered and being pressured to dispose of banked sperm.

The terrestrial landscape is dominated by oligotrophic mineral soils and extensive exposed rocky surfaces where biota are largely restricted to microbial communities, although their ability to perform the majority of geobiological processes has remained largely uncharacterized. Here, we identified functional traits that drive microbial survival and community assembly, using a metagenomic approach with GeoChip-based functional gene arrays to establish metabolic capabilities in communities inhabiting soil and rock surface niches in McKelvey Valley. Major pathways in primary metabolism were identified, indicating significant plasticity in autotrophic, heterotrophic, and diazotrophic strategies supporting microbial communities. This represents a major advance beyond biodiversity surveys in {{that we have now}} identified how putative functional ecology drives microbial community assembly. Significant differences were apparent between open soil, hypolithic, chasmoendolithic, and cryptoendolithic communities. A suite of previously unappreciated Antarctic microbial stress response pathways, thermal, osmotic, and nutrient limitation responses were identified and related to environmental stressors, <b>offering</b> <b>tangible</b> clues to the mechanisms behind the enduring success of microorganisms in this seemingly inhospitable terrain. Rocky substrates exposed to larger fluctuations in environmental stress supported greater functional diversity in stress-response pathways than soils.

Although there is extensive literature available on appropriate strategic responses to the single market scenario, very few of these writings contain guidance specifically related to the situation facing smaller firms. The objective {{of this study was to}} gain further understanding of which factors are likely to influence the performance of firms in the small and medium-size enterprise sector. This was achieved through a comparative study of approximately 200 UK and German small food processing firms. The major difference between UK and German companies are that the latter (i) identified a much broader range of factors which they believe will influence their performance and (ii) have adopted a strategic orientation towards managing those internal competencies necessary to sustain market performance over the longer term. In contrast UK owner/managers are mainly concerned with factors likely to affect short term financial performance.

The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the factors that affect walkability in Doha and attempt to adopt and develop a Walkability Index Model (WIM) that will enable architects, urban planners and other decision makers to translate the perceptual qualities of streets, which are qualitative in nature, to a reliable quantitative value. To achieve this, the methodology of a previous study by Maryland Inventory of Urban Design Qualities (MIUDQ- 2006) was adopted. Based on the methodology adopted in this study and in order to gain the input required to develop the WIM, video footage of 30 streets across Doha were recorded and then rated by 10 professional experts in terms of walkability, and a set of selected urban design qualities.

40|$|ABSTRACT   Aim: Despite the {{domestic}} and international importance of services the research about the internationalization of services it is limited. Compared to products, services differ in nature. They are intangible and heterogeneous, meaning they are usually consumed {{at the point of}} purchase and are performed, as well as perceived differently. When a service provider wants to market its offerings in culturally distant country, the local country's culture is an important factor during the process of adaptation/standardization of the service. What is acceptable in one country might not be acceptable in another. Thus, this study aims to identify how adaptation/standardization of a service in a foreign country takes place, how the problems of intangibility and heterogeneity are handled.   Method: This study presents the single case of the Swedish medical systems company Elekta and its efforts to market its Gamma Knife Technology, a neurosurgical method, to Brazil. It is based on secondary data, in form of topic related books, scientific articles and internet sources, only. For gathering primary data, an exploratory research design was chosen to conduct a qualitative research. Structured interviews were chosen to acquire data since they are particularly helpful when dealing with complex issues. The interviews were sent in form of email questionnaires to a contact person at Elekta's head quarter in Sweden, as well as the Swedish/Brazilian co-operation. However, both interviewees did not respond contrary to prior agreements.   Result & conclusion: The analysis of the findings revealed that, according to Hofstede's  Five Cultural Dimensions both countries differ greatly in culture. Whilst some service characteristics are likely to be fully or mainly standardized, others will have to be adapted in order to fit the local culture. The service itself, as well as the service's process, its people involved and its physical evidence offer great potential for standardization, whereas pricing and promotion tend to be affected strongly by income and language and thus, is likely to require adaptation. Clearly, the local culture plays an important role during the process of adaptation/standardization. Cultural adaption can make service <b>offering</b> more <b>tangible</b> by reducing the gap of misunderstanding. Service providers should standardise service offerings, ideas, values and beliefs connected to the quality of a service and adapt factors related to the market. Standardisation and adaptation can both be implemented successfully in the market. A balanced combination makes services more homogenous and tangible. Suggestion for further research: There is limited research available concerning the internationalization of services, with special regards to the process of adaptation /standardization. This study is based only on a single case, without primary research. Further research in Trust and Networking is required to complete the model. Furthermore, lacking primary sources from both companies, further research regarding of how both companies are providing services are required. Contribution of the thesis: This work seeks to make a contribution towards a clearer understanding of international services marketing and the process of adaptation/standardization of services. It emphasizes on the importance of culture during the process of adaptation/standardization with regards to the intangibility and heterogeneity of services. It is based on previous research conduct by Hyder & Fregidou-Malama (2007) focusing on the adaptation/standardization of Elekta's services in Egypt.

Rapid land degradation and uncontrolled world population are serious threats to our food security which has almost reached its tipping point. To ensure the sustainable food supply, development of drought and salt stress tolerant crops has become imperative.

T 1 progeny of six selected transgenic plants showed better germination, root and shoot length at three NaCl treatments (0, 100 and 200 mM), three PEG- 6000 treatments (0, 10 and 20 %) and four doses of basta herbicide (0, 2, 3 and 4 mg ml- 1). At 200 mM NaCl, transgenic event ST 6 showed 41 %, 42. 6 % and 45. 5 % higher germination rate, root and shoot length than the non-transgenic plant. Similarly at 20 % PEG- 6000, same ST 6 event showed 41. 2 %, 67. 7 % and 38. 3 % higher germination rate, root and shoot length than non-transgenic plant. Whereas at 4 mg ml- 1 basta, again ST 6 was better performer with 96 %, 97. 6 % and 95. 3 % higher germination, root and shoot length than the non-transgenic plant. RT-PCR demonstrated higher transcript level of transgenes at both NaCl and PEG- 6000 in comparison non-transgenic plants. Similarly, HVA 1 transgenes exhibited improved membrane stability index (MSI), minimum electrolyte leakage (EL), better photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (C), water use efficiency (WUE), osmotic potential, water potential and turgor potential under both drought and salinity treatments. Much higher K+, K+/Na+ ratio and proline contents and relatively lower Na+ contents were observed in case of transgenic events ST 1, ST 5 and ST 6 when compared to non-transgenic plant. Transgenes showed less yield penalty under reduced irrigation treatments and gave 13. 14 % and 78 % higher grain yield than non-transgenic plant under severe drought and salinity treatments. Similarly, transgenes ST 3, ST 4, ST 5 and ST 6 performed much better than nontransgenic plant with respect to plant height, flag leaf area, number of tillers, root shoot weight, root shoot length and grain weight under both drought (4, 2 and 0 irrigations in field) and salinity stress (0. 4, 10 and 20 dS m- 1 in pots). Current study offers highly efficient transformation system for local high yielding but abiotic stress sensitive wheat varieties that got the potential to perform much better in open field. Transgenic events ST 6, ST 5 and ST 4 proved to be highly salt and drought tolerant under different water deficit and salinity treatments both in lab and field based experiments and thus can be further utilized for varietal development for drought and salinity prone areas of sub-continent...|$|R
40|$|Decision-making is {{more complex}} and even more {{important}} for consumers today than in the past. Today’s consumers has {{a wealth of information}} sources to their disposal, through advertising, news articles, direct mailings and word of mouth, in addition, there is a variety of stores and shopping malls that has broaden the sphere for consumer choice, and in the process complicated decision - making. Consumers purchase intentions and decision that lead to the purchase are closely related to their future purchase behaviour. That is, a consumer who has used and is satisfied with a brand is likely to try it again on a future purchase occasion and is likely to follow this up with actual purchase of the brand. In this instance attitude is important to marketers not because it predicts what brands a consumers will buy, but because it can explain why they buy the brand they do. There is a need to explore and understand consumer shopping behaviour and purchase drivers within the fruit juice category. The refrigerated fruit juice category presents much confusion to the consumer and/ or shoppers, (consumer and shopper being used inter changeable) and makes it difficult to shop the category. There are many choices and lack of clarity around fruit juice types, therefore there is also a need to quantify how shoppers shop the fruit juice category. As part of a category approach to business management, consumer insights can improve merchandise positioning and promotion of the fruit juice category. The purpose and importance of the study is to gain insights into how shoppers select fruit juice(s), identify patterns of shopping behaviour. To determine how involved are shoppers in the category when selecting and purchasing their fruit juice, and to what level their commit to they selected fruit juice type. The purpose is not to produce a definitive conclusion or generalisable results, because shopper behaviour, will differ depending on store type, day of the week and day time part, but rather to form a basis to begin to understand the shoppers dynamics for the fruit juice category. Insights gained and understanding of category purchase drivers, will enable the development of an optimal category flow (shop shelf merchandising lay out) ensuring overall improvements for the category ensuring that shopper needs are met, which in turn would result in an improved shopping experience. This will also allow for an optimal marketing mix for the various brands for the different fruit juice types, that, will ensure that the brand increased its potential to be selected in-store and therefore increase its rate of sale. The literature reviewed, illustrated the complexity of consumer behaviour, as one is dealing with human behaviour, that is not always easy to comprehend, because many factors influence behaviour. These factors vary from internal factors and external factors. One can therefore not deal with the topic on consumer behaviour and look at factors in isolation, one should attempt to have a holistic approach as the literature suggest because many variables impact on one aspect for example such as decision-making. The key lessons learnt from this study, is no different to what the literature states, the fruit juice consumer exhibited complex and various behaviour. Whilst the target groups were homogeneous, the shoppers exhibit different behaviours, hence the clusters from the (In) store TM model. However there are agreements on the following; • Loyalty in the fruit juice category is low. • There is a desire to try something new as indicative of the high prevalence of experiential shoppers. • Shoppers indicated that they decision to purchase a fruit juice is not entirely made in-store, but rather planned. • Shoppers exhibit a low level of commitment to the category. • Shoppers indicated that product related attributes do influence their purchase decision. • The fruit juice category is not well differentiated. The above findings on product involvement and commitment have managerial implications, and are important issues in {{the development and implementation of}} marketing strategies, aimed at building and maintaining market share. In-store investment should be limited to product specific promotions, and not the traditional fridge-end display and gondola ends as these promotional elements are in effective in generating sales. The challenge is to win time for the shopper in-store, is also crucial as consumers do not always have the time to shop. The product category flow should be clear and uncluttered, with product types clearly segmented in the fridge. Satisfying consumers are not enough to yield a competitive advantage, what marketers need to do is lock consumers into what their product has to offer. Marketers need to seek bonding and lasting relationships with their consumers, to ensure a competitive advantage, this they need to do by creating and evoked set, in other words, position their products in the minds of the consumer and entrench their offerings with a value added proposition intrinsic and extrinsic. The key to doing this is to ensure that their product <b>offering(s)</b> are <b>tangible</b> and visually differentiated, have an ownable proposition that will generate loyalty towards the product offering and create a high level of involvement.
