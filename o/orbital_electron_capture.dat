50|$|The {{two methods}} for this {{conversion}} are {{mediated by the}} weak force, and involve types of beta decay. In the simplest beta decay, neutrons are converted to protons by emitting a negative electron and an antineutrino. This is always possible outside a nucleus because neutrons are more massive than protons by an equivalent of about 2.5 electrons. In the opposite process, which only happens within a nucleus, and not to free particles, a proton may become a neutron by ejecting a positron. This is permitted if enough energy is available between parent and daughter nuclides to do this (the required energy difference is equal to 1.022 MeV, which is the mass of 2 electrons). If the mass difference between parent and daughter is less than this, a proton-rich nucleus may still convert protons to neutrons {{by the process of}} <b>electron</b> <b>capture,</b> in which a proton simply <b>electron</b> <b>captures</b> one of the atom's K <b>orbital</b> <b>electrons,</b> emits a neutrino, and becomes a neutron.|$|R

Periodic transitions between the hyperfine states could possible lead to the observed effect. Both selected nuclides decay to stable daughter nuclei via allowed Gamow-Teller transitions. Due to the conservation of total angular momentum, the allowed EC decay can only proceed from the hyperfine ground state of parent ions.
