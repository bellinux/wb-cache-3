5|$|The most {{frequently}} used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible–infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits <b>optical</b> <b>sensing</b> of surface reflectance, {{which has led to}} other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, {{it is important to have}} continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the launch}} of the first Landsat {{satellite}} in the early 1970 ’s, the field of space-borne <b>optical</b> remote <b>sensing</b> has made significant progress. Advances have been made in all aspects of <b>optical</b> remote <b>sensing</b> data including improved spatial, temporal, spectral and radiometric resolutions which have increased the uptake of these data by wider scientific communities. Flagship satellite missions like NASA’s Terra and Aqua and ESA’s Envisat with their high temporal (< 3 days) and spectral (15 - 36 bands) resolutions opened new opportunities for routine monitoring of various aspects of terrestrial ecosystems at global scale and have provided greater understanding of critical biophysical processes in the terrestrial ecosystem. Launch of new satellite sensors such as Landsat 8 and ESA’s Copernicus Sentinel missions (e. g. Sentinel 2 with improved spatial resolution (10 - 60 m) and potential revisit time of 5 days) are set to revolutionise the availability and use of remote sensing data in global terrestrial ecosystem monitoring. Furthermore, the recent move towards use of constellations of nanosatellites (e. g. the the Flock missions by Planet Labs) to collect on-demand high spatial and temporal resolution <b>optical</b> remote <b>sensing</b> data would enable uptake of these data for operational monitoring. As a result of increase in data availability, i <b>optical</b> remote <b>sensing</b> data are now increasingly used to support a number of operational services (e. g. land monitoring, atmosphere monitoring, and climate change studies).
