5|$|In 1995, the Ramones {{released}} ¡Adios Amigos!, their fourteenth studio album, {{and announced}} that they planned to disband {{if it was not}} successful. Its sales were unremarkable, garnering it just two weeks on {{the lower end of the}} Billboard chart. The band spent late 1995 on what was promoted as a farewell tour. However, they accepted an offer to appear in the sixth Lollapalooza festival, which toured around the United States during the following summer. After the Lollapalooza tour's conclusion, the Ramones played their final show on August 6, 1996, at the Palace in Hollywood. A recording of the concert was later released on video and CD as We're <b>Outta</b> <b>Here!.</b> In addition to a reappearance by Dee Dee, the show featured several guests including Motörhead's Lemmy, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, Soundgarden's Chris Cornell, Numskull's Ralph Foster and Rancid's Tim Armstrong and Lars Frederiksen.|$|E

500|$|On May 23, 2007, Marilyn Manson and Tim Skold {{appeared}} on UK radio station BBC Radio 1's program Live Lounge to promote Marilyn Manson's 2007 album Eat Me, Drink Me. They performed an acoustic version of [...] "Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)", followed with an acoustic cover of [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". The Manson cover {{does not include}} the interlude. On May 28, 2007, Dutch singer Esmée Denters posted a version of the song on YouTube accompanied by Justin Timberlake on piano and backing vocals. At the conclusion, he says, [...] "She sings my song better than me." [...] Timberlake later produced Denters' debut album, <b>Outta</b> <b>Here.</b> French singer Myriam Abel, the winner of Nouvelle Star 3, also recorded a non-commercial cover of [...] "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around" [...] with a Raï influence, accessible through her official MySpace page. An a cappella rendition was recorded by Overboard for their 2007 album, Stranded. American post hardcore band Alesana recorded a cover for the Punk Goes... compilation series, Punk Goes Pop 2, released March 10, 2009. Taylor Swift performed a mashup of [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] and [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] during her Fearless Tour (2009−10). Benny Davis, of the Australian musical comedy act The Axis of Awesome, also heavily sampled the song on his track [...] "Another Four Chords" [...] on The Human Jukebox EP, released in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{prior to}} the 2013 Super Bowl, Chris Culliver of the San Francisco 49ers responded as follows to an {{interview}} question about whether he had any gay teammates: [...] "We don't have any gay guys on the team... They gotta get up <b>outta</b> <b>here</b> if they do. Can't be with that sweet stuff." [...] You Can Play, GLAAD, and Athlete Ally released a joint statement condemning these views. Culliver subsequently apologized and pledged to grow from the experience.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Family Guy Viewer Mail #1", Peter and Brian were {{watching}} Sesame Street. After the Count had counted out seven bats, Peter asks Brian if [...] "they ever show him doin someone in and feedin on em". The Count {{also appeared in}} another episode where Meg claims that she dated him, and then flashes {{back to a time}} where they were beginning to have sex (showing her taking off her shirt with the camera on to her back) and the Count started counting her nipples, but is repulsed on discovering that she has three (One nipple! HAHAHA! Two nipples! HAHAHA! Three nip-oh, hell no, I'm <b>outta</b> <b>here).</b>|$|E
2500|$|In February 2017, {{during an}} {{interview}} with The Breakfast Club radio show, T.I. revealed he would retire from making music after three more solo albums: [...] "I'm ready {{to get the hell}} <b>outta</b> <b>here,</b> though. I got, like, two, I got, this next album and two, I got three more albums in my head, conceptualized. Once I get them out, I'm done. [...] We're still doing it. … [...] The next one is more like trap music. It’s Trap Muzik 2017. And the one after that, it’s gonna be more like a, uh, love as it pertains to a dope boy. And the one after that, that’s my final album. It’s called Kill the King. The last album is Kill the King. Simply because ever since my first album, I've put the title of 'King of the South' on me and to make yourself the king is to make you a target. And in chess, the object is to kill the king. So Kill the King is the title of my last album. Will they kill him or will he ride into the sunset happily ever after?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Braves {{returned}} to Atlanta, and on April 8, 1974, {{a crowd of}} 53,775 people showed up for the game—a Braves attendance record. The game was also broadcast nationally on NBC. In the fourth inning, Aaron hit home run number 715 off Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Al Downing. Although Dodgers outfielder Bill Buckner nearly went over the outfield wall trying to catch it, the ball landed in the Braves' bullpen, where relief pitcher Tom House caught it. While cannons were fired in celebration, two college students [...] sprinted onto the field and jogged alongside Aaron for part of his circuit around the bases, temporarily startling him. A very youthful Craig Sager actually interviewed Aaron between third and home for a television station, WXLT (now WWSB-Channel 40) in Sarasota. As the fans cheered wildly, Aaron's parents ran onto the field as well. Braves announcer Milo Hamilton, calling the game on WSB radio, described the scene as Aaron broke the record: [...] "Henry Aaron, {{in the second inning}} walked and scored. He's sittin' on 714. Here's the pitch by Downing. Swinging. There's a drive into left-center field. That ball is gonna be-eee... <b>Outta</b> <b>here!</b> It's gone! It's 715! There's a new home run champion of all time, and it's Henry Aaron! The fireworks are going. Henry Aaron is coming around third. His teammates are at home plate. And listen to this crowd!" [...] Meanwhile, Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully addressed the racial tension— or apparent lack thereof— in his call of the home run: [...] "What a marvelous moment for baseball; what a marvelous moment for Atlanta and the state of Georgia; what a marvelous moment for the country and the world. A black man is getting a standing ovation in the Deep South for breaking a record of an all-time baseball idol. And it is a great moment for all of us, and particularly for Henry Aaron. ...And {{for the first time in}} a long time, that poker face in Aaron shows the tremendous strain and relief of what it must have been like to live with for the past several months." [...] On October 2, 1974, Aaron hit his 733rd and final home run as a Braves player. Thirty days later, after Aaron decided not to retire, the Braves traded him to the Milwaukee Brewers for Roger Alexander and Dave May. The trade re-united Aaron with former teammate Del Crandall, who was now managing the Brewers. On May 1, 1975, Aaron broke baseball's all-time RBI record, previously held by Ruth with 2,213. That year, he also played in his last and 24th All-Star Game (25th All-Star Game selection); he lined out to Dave Concepción as a pinch-hitter in the second inning. This All-Star Game, like the first one he played in 1955, was before a home crowd at Milwaukee County Stadium.|$|E
