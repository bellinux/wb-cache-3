But being bused to Everett turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
5|$|The conspirators {{took over}} the Tilipuchuri tavern facing the square in {{preparation}} for the robbery. A witness, David Sagirashvili, later stated that he had been walking in Yerevan Square when a friend named Bachua Kupriashvili, who later turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the robbers, invited him into a tavern and asked him to stay. Once inside the tavern, Sagirashvili realized that armed men were stopping people from leaving. When they received a signal that the bank stagecoach was nearing the square, the armed men quickly left the building with pistols drawn.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the loss}} of his father, Skelton went to work as early as the age of seven, selling {{newspapers}} and doing other odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home. He quickly learned the newsboy's patter and would keep it up until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet him. According to later accounts, Skelton's early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from an incident that took place in Vincennes around 1923, when a stranger, supposedly the comedian Ed Wynn, approached Skelton, who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. When the man asked Skelton what events were going on in town, Skelton suggested he see the new show in town. The man purchased every paper Skelton had, providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the show's stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had already shown comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer.|$|E

5|$|Smythe {{first became}} {{interested}} in horse racing as a boy, when he would take stories his father wrote at the track to the newspaper office downtown. Smythe started owning horses in the late 1920s, but he rarely had any success. One early purchase turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of his most famous. When Mrs. L. A. Livingston sold off her stable, he bought Rare Jewel, a filly, for $250. The filly regularly ran last. The horse was eligible for the Coronation Futurity Stakes, {{one of the best}} two-year-old races. Smythe was full of blind hope, and on the trainer's advice, entered her in the race. The day of the race, both the trainer and his partner gave the horse some brandy, unknown to Smythe, who bet over $100 on Rare Jewel. She won the race, a 100–1 longshot paying $214.40 on a $2 bet, besting future Queen's Plate winner Froth Blower. Between the winnings from his bets and his portion of the winner's purse as horse owner, Smythe won more than $10,000 on that one race. Three weeks later, he put his windfall to work for the Maple Leafs by purchasing star defenceman King Clancy from the depression-strapped Ottawa Senators for $35,000. The purchase was only possible because of his gambling winnings, as the other Maple Leafs owners refused to pay the Senators' then-high price, and only agreed when Smythe volunteered to use his own money.|$|E

Although Obatala eats female animals due to his duality and age, after receiving Ochanla, the adherent must feed Ayagunna male animals and Ochanla female. Ayagunna is often envisioned {{in a similar fashion}} <b>to</b> Shango. He <b>is</b> a member of the fun-fun (white) court of Obatala as a divine king, as are all of his other manifestations. When his adherents manifest his energies during religious trance sessions, Ayagunna behaves with swift, strong, and battle-like movements.

40|$|In {{the current}} fast-moving, global and complex {{business}} world, implementing organisational change {{has become one}} of the major leadership issues.

However, as the business world is becoming more complex, organisations are following the same path and are developing increasingly complicated structures. Risk of failure in implementing change in such complex organisations is consequently high and leaders must lead strategic moves with dexterity. They must understand their role, the required skills as well as the importance of the people while starting to implement change. They must understand where to exert their influence and they should therefore <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> determine what <b>are</b> the key success factors <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken into consideration in the implementation process...|$|R

40|$|In {{thinking}} about policy, academic economists alternate between theoretical models in which governments can design finely-tuned optimal interventions and practical considerations which usually assume the government <b>to</b> <b>be</b> incompetent and hostage to special interests. I argue {{in this paper}} that neither of these caricatures is accurate, and that there <b>is</b> much <b>to</b> <b>be</b> learned by undertaking systematic, analytical studies of state capabilities [...] how they are generated and why they differ across countries and issue areas. Case studies of export subsidization in Korea, Brazil, Turkey, India, Kenya, and Bolivia <b>are</b> presented <b>to</b> confront usual presumptions against actual experience. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the successful cases (Korea and Brazil) turn <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ones</b> {{in which the government}} exercised discretion and selectivity, while the most uniform and non-discretionary cases (Kenya and Bolivia) were clear failures. The paradox is explained in terms of state autonomy and policy coherence. ...|$|R
