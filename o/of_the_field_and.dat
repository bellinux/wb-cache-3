The other cars started from the grid in the order they were at the point the race was stopped. Michael Schumacher had a poor start and Gerhard Berger took the lead on track (but Schumacher still led the race overall due to the amount of time he was ahead of Berger before the race was stopped). Hill, from third, made contact attempting to overtake Schumacher at the Tosa corner, dropping Hill to the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> was forced to make a pitstop in order to fit a new nose cone.

5|$|Rosenqvist won {{the pole}} {{position}} by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and maintained his start line advantage {{on the first}} lap. He {{pulled away from the}} rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> kept the lead until the mandatory round of pit stops when Buemi took over the first position for one lap until he made his stop. Rosenqvist regained the lead but was required to conserve his car's electrical energy usage because of making a pit stop one lap earlier {{than the rest of the}} field, allowing Buemi to narrow the time deficit between the two drivers. Buemi passed Rosenqvist for the lead on the 27th lap and held it for the remainder of the race to clinch the win. There were two lead changes among two different drivers during the course of the race.|$|E

The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing molecular assemblers, which are molecular machines which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of molecular nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.|$|E

5|$|The {{calutron}} {{is a type}} of sector mass spectrometer, {{an instrument}} in which a sample is ionized and then accelerated by electric fields and deflected by magnetic fields. The ions ultimately collide with a plate and produce a measurable electric current. Since the ions of the different isotopes have the same electric charge but different masses, the heavier isotopes are deflected less by the magnetic field, causing the beam of particles to separate out into several beams by mass, striking the plate at different locations. The mass of the ions can be calculated according to the strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> the charge of the ions. During World War II, calutrons were developed to use this principle to obtain substantial quantities of high-purity uranium-235, by taking advantage of the small mass difference between uranium isotopes.|$|E

He made good the lost yardage on the next play, however, {{completing}} a 42-yard throw to Danny Coale. From the Stanford 40-yard line, Taylor gained fiveyards on a running play, then attempted a long pass downfield. The throw was intercepted by Stanford's Delano Howell at the Cardinal 3-yard line, returning Luck and the Stanford offense to the field. Luck needed only two plays to drive the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> score a touchdown. A 56-yard run by Stepfan Taylor {{was followed by a}} 41-yard touchdown pass to Coby Fleener, and the following extra point kick was good, making the score 26–12 with 5:49 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Abt fell to seventh {{when he was}} {{overtaken}} by Prost at the first corner on lap ten, and the former defended from a large pack of cars. By the twelfth lap, Buemi had more usable electrical energy available and closed up to Piquet, overtaking him around the inside for fourth position at the seventh turn. Félix da Costa's vehicle stopped at turn eight on lap twelve. However, the deployment of a full course yellow flag was avoided when he received radio instructions from his team to perform a full reset, enabling him to rejoin the race. By then, he had dropped to the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> later became the race's first retirement. Upfront, Rosenqvist held a five-second advantage over Bird by the fourteenth lap, but the latter was being caught by Vergne by more than four-tenths of a second per lap. Although he had less electrical energy, Vergne caught Bird, who had been backed into Buemi, and moved {{in front of him}} {{at the start of the}} 16th lap with Bird electing not to defend the second position. The mandatory pit stops, during which all drivers need to change into a second car, began on the same lap. When Rosenqvist and Vergne entered the pit lane Buemi and Bird elected to remain on the circuit for another lap. Buemi was running quicker and overtook Bird at turn eleven on lap 17. He braked late for turn eleven but avoided going off the circuit. Piquet was affected by an electrical problem, ending his chances of finishing in a points-scoring position. Engel stopped his vehicle after making his pit stop, and became the event's second retirement with electrical problems. After the pit stops, Rosenqvist regained the first position, retaining most of his four-second advantage over Vergne. Di Grassi had been passed by Turvey but reclaimed sixth place from him shortly afterwards and started to close up to teammate Abt.|$|E

Ceccon finished one with one second covering Evans in third and Nasr in fourth; Evans narrowly fended off Nasr for the final podium place. Calado secured fifth with Coletti taking sixth and Binder seventh. Quaife-Hobbs passed Richemi for eighth place in the final stages of the race and thus earned the sprint race pole position. Richelmi and De Jong rounded out the top-ten points-scoring positions. Dillmann, Lancaster, Trummer, Rosenzweig and Canamasas took the next five places and Abt was the last of the classified finishers. It was Bird's third win in the GP2 Series, his (and Russian Time's) second of the season, and his first victory at the circuit since his 2012 Formula Renault 3.5 Series Monaco round triumph. After the race, the stewards deemed Cecotto responsible for causing the first lap accident that triggered the race's sole stoppage and Cecotto was barred from competing in the following day's sprint event.|$|E
5|$|California {{began its}} next drive at its 29-yard line {{after a short}} kickoff return. At first, the Bears {{struggled}} to move the ball, but were helped by a 15-yard personal foul penalty against Virginia Tech. This advanced the ball near midfield and gave California a first down. Aaron Rodgers then completed a series of passes to drive California into the Virginia Tech side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> into the end zone. On a 13-yard pass to J. J. Arrington, Rodgers cut Virginia Tech's lead to 28–21 with 30seconds remaining. Virginia Tech took over after the kickoff at its 31-yard line. Kevin Jones ran for 15yards and Bryan Randall completed a 30-yard pass to drive Tech into California territory. Tech was unable to advance the ball further, but kicker Carter Warley was sent in to attempt a 45-yard field goal. As time expired in the first half, Warley's kick missed, denying the Hokies a chance to extend their lead. At {{the end of the}} first half, Virginia Tech still held a 28–21 lead.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Major League Baseball {{team owners}} met {{to demand that}} minor league owners improve their ballparks {{in order to meet}} their desired standards.

Following his failed bid to secure an MLB team for Nashville in the 1993 Major League Baseball {{expansion}} process (Nashville was one of ten cities considered, but was eliminated from contention very early in the process; the two new franchises were eventually awarded to Denver and Miami), Schmittou focused on scaling-back his proposed MLB stadium into a new Triple-A facility for the Sounds. At a time when other Triple-A cities were building new, relatively luxurious ballparks, Schmittou was unable to convince mayor Phil Bredesen or the Metro Council to pay for such a new park. He considered moving the team to a surrounding county, and even tried, unsuccessfully, to get the Metro Council to pass a referendum to let taxpayers vote on a temporary tax increase to pay off a proposed $40million stadium in three years. In the end, Schmittou elected to keep the Sounds at Greer but make significant improvements to the stadium.|$|E
