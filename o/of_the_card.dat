5|$|Effective October 1, 2013, {{the price}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> {{was reduced to}} $2, the rebate program was discontinued, and the maximum {{permitted}} negative balance upon exit was set at $1.50, with riders who would exceed this being required to use the Exitfare machines to add value to their cards.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} proponents of the strategy of splitting eights is Ed Thorp, who developed the strategy on an IBM 704 {{as part of an}} overall blackjack strategic theory published in Beat the Dealer: A Winning Strategy for the Game of Twenty-One in 1962. Thorp was the originator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> counting system for blackjack.|$|E
5|$|Riders {{enter and}} exit the system using a stored-value {{card in the}} form of a {{proximity}} card known as SmarTrip.

50|$|The game {{is divided}} into two phases: the first phases {{consists}} <b>of</b> playing <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> into <b>the</b> Zodiac and the Equator; the second phase is <b>the</b> building <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> into <b>the</b> foundations.|$|R
50|$|In addition, with <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cards</b> Against Humanity team, the 2014 MIT Mystery Hunt held a Cards Against Wonderland {{event with}} MIT and Wonderland themed decks of 416 cards (346 white, 70 black). Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> {{consisted}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Presidential family <b>of</b> 129 B.C committing incest (for the winsest) with aliens. A {{limited number of}} decks were printed for the event, but PDF versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> were provided to all teams after the event ended.|$|R
5|$|The multi-coloured Personalised card is {{available}} on registration. The name and, if opted, {{a photo of the}} holder are imprinted on the cards. They can function automatically as a Child, Adult, or Elder card by recognising the cardholder's age stored on the card, hence accounting for different concessionary fares. As of 2003, there were 380,000 holders of Personalised Octopus cards. In addition to all the functions of an ordinary card, this card {{can be used as a}} key card for access to residential and office buildings. If a Personalised card is lost, the holder may report the loss by phone to prevent unauthorised use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> A refund would then be issued to the holder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> for the deposit and the value that remained on the card three hours after the loss is reported, minus a HK$30 card cost and a HK$20 handling fee.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterward, Alan Ray {{came back}} into the picture, {{claiming}} that he had proof the card had been doctored by Mastro at one point after the initial $25,000 trade in 1985. He had a photograph <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> taken before the transaction with Mastro and claimed that the card in the photo looked significantly different from the photo of Gretzky's card. He sent the comparison of the two photos to both McNall and Sotheby's, but never received a response back. Some memorabilia collectors have dismissed Ray's claims, saying that the photo hardly proves any doctoring was ever done on the card.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} market started with comic book stores, and hobby shops displaying and selling cards, with the cards' values determined somewhat arbitrarily {{by the employees}} of the store. With {{the expansion of the}} internet, prices of cards were determined by the amount of tournament deck lists a given card would appear in. If a card was played in a tournament more frequently, the cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> would be higher (in addition to the market availability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card).</b> When eBay, Amazon, and other large online markets started to gain popularity, the Magic {{secondary market}} evolved substantially. Buying and selling Magic cards online became a source of income for people who learned how to manipulate the market. Today, the secondary market is so large and complex, it has become an area of study for consumer research, and some people make a career out of market manipulation, creating mathematical models to analyze the growth of cards' worth, and predict the market value of both individual cards, and entire sets of cards.|$|E

5000|$|If {{both players}} have <b>the</b> same number <b>of</b> <b>cards</b> in a suit, then they must tally <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards.</b> <b>The</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> are as follows: ace = 11, face cards = 10, and face {{value for the}} rest. After adding <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards,</b> <b>the</b> elder calls out the number. The younger may then say [...] "Good", if the elder's value is greater, or [...] "Not good" [...] and the number that wins the point. For example: [...] "Not good: 39" [...] or [...] "Not good, I have 39". If the values are the same, younger says [...] "Equal".|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>card</b> game {{contract}} bridge, a suit {{combination is}} {{a specific set of}} cards of a particular suit visible in declarer's and dummy's hands at <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards.</b> While <b>the</b> ranks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining <b>cards</b> held in <b>the</b> two unseen hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opponents can be deduced precisely, their location is unknown. Suit combinations allow for all possible lies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject suit in the two closed hands.|$|R
5|$|After {{twenty years}} of career struggles and obscurity, Thelonious Monk had become a jazz star with a {{residency}} at the Five Spot Caf√© in New York City's East Village. In his first stable job in years, he helped transform the small bar {{into one of the}} city's most popular venues, as it attracted bohemians, hipsters, and devout fans of Monk's music. His employment there was a result of an appeal by his manager Harry Colomby to the State Liquor Authority (SLA) to restore Monk's cabaret card. Monk was stripped <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> in 1951 when he was convicted of narcotics possession; he had refused to betray his friend and pianist Bud Powell to the police after they discovered Powell's glassine envelope of heroin laying beside Monk's feet in the car of Powell's female companion.|$|E
5|$|Making or {{recording}} a payment using the card for public transport or purchases at Octopus-enabled retailers {{can be done}} by holding the card against or waving it over an Octopus card reader from up to a few centimetres away. The reader will acknowledge payment by emitting a beep, and displaying the amount deducted and the remaining balance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> Standard transaction time for readers used for public transport is 0.3 seconds, while that of readers used for retailers is 1 second. When using the MTR system, the entry point of commuters is noted when a passenger enters, and the appropriate amount based on distance traveled will be deducted when the users validate their cards again at the exit point.|$|E
5|$|On-Loan {{cards are}} issued for usage in day-to-day functions, {{primarily}} for fare payment in transport systems. They are further classified into Child, Adult, Elder, and Personalised categories, {{with the first}} three based on age and different amounts of fare concession. With {{the exception of the}} Personalised cards, On-Loan cards are anonymous; no personal information, bank account, or credit card details are stored on the card, and no identification is required for the purchase of these cards. If an owner loses a card, only the stored value and the deposit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> are lost. On-Loan Octopus cards may be purchased at all MTR stations, the KMB Customer Service Centre, New World First Ferry (NWFF) Octopus Service Centres, and the New World First Bus (NWFB) Customer Service Centre. A student on-loan Octopus Card was initially issued, but was discontinued in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Another {{explanation}} surmised is that Wagner did not consent {{because he}} felt he was not receiving just compensation from the ATC for his baseball card. Wagner had a history of being a tough negotiator; he had announced his retirement from baseball in December 1907, but returned shortly {{before the start of the}} 1908 baseball season after receiving a $10,000 contract, double his salary from the 1907 season. This theory has its flaws, however, since Wagner sent Gruber a check for $10 to compensate him for the fee ATC would have paid him if Wagner had given permission to create his baseball card. Michael O'Keeffe and Teri Thompson, authors of The Card: Collectors, Con Men, and the True Story of History's Most Desired Baseball Card, asked why Wagner would compensate Gruber for $10, a substantial amount of money at the time (approximately equal to $275 in 2016), if he refused authorization for monetary reasons. The ATC had already produced a number of T206 Honus Wagner baseball cards; the exact number is unknown, but is speculated to be between 50 and 200. They stopped production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card,</b> however, after Wagner denied authorization.|$|E
5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} hard time getting started as she is afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints are already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E
5|$|Tetra Master is a card-based minigame {{that can}} be {{initiated}} with various non-playable characters in the field. Players assemble a deck of five cards, which can be obtained via chests, given as a reward, or earned from fighting monsters. Each card has various arrows which point to the four sides and four corners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card,</b> and various stats that vary between cards, with rarer cards being more powerful. Players take it in turns to strategically place cards on a 4x4 playing grid based on the available directions. Battles can occur when players place a card next to another card, depending on where the player places it. If the defending card has no arrows whilst the attacking card has an arrow pointing towards it, that card is placed under the player's control. When two arrows meet with each other, the cards do battle based on their point values, with the losing card coming under the winning player's control, sometimes triggering combos that put multiple cards in the winner's control. After all cards are played, the winner is the player who has the most cards under their control, with a draw occurring {{if they have the}} same number of cards. The winning player may choose a card from their opponent's deck out of the ones they put under their control. If the winning player scores a perfect win however, in which all ten cards are put under their control, they will win all five cards from the opponent's deck.|$|E
