5|$|The Østensjø Line {{became part}} of the Oslo Metro in 1967, and several of the Class E trams were {{transferred}} {{to other parts of the}} tramway. However, the Lilleaker Line was instead tied to the Ekeberg Line on the east side of the city, and the trams started operating on the Jar–Ljabru service. After the last bus route had been converted to one-man operation and the conductor replaced with a ticket-selling motorman, Oslo Sporveier started the process <b>of</b> <b>converting</b> their tram fleet. No. 176 was converted as a trial, and after 1971, all the remaining Gullfisks were converted. Because the trams had been delivered with a single front door, the cost <b>of</b> <b>converting</b> the trams was very little, and the single-manning highly profitable.|$|E
5|$|Unboxing is the {{operation}} <b>of</b> <b>converting</b> {{a value of}} a reference type (previously boxed) into a value of a value type. Unboxing in C# requires an explicit type cast. A boxed object of type T can only be unboxed to a T (or a nullable T).|$|E

In 1964 the building was considerably altered by adding a 17-storey tower and a kitchen and dining complex to the building. In 2004 the University submitted plans to demolish these extensions with the intention <b>of</b> <b>converting</b> the original house into a conference venue and building new blocks of flats on the remaining landscaped gardens.

5|$|After the 1960s, lack of {{investment}} led to local {{services and the}} station becoming increasingly run down. By the early 1980s, Marylebone was under serious threat of closure. In 1983, British Rail chairman Peter Parker commissioned a report into the possibility <b>of</b> <b>converting</b> Marylebone into a 'high-speed bus way', whereby Marylebone would be converted into a coach station. The tracks between Marylebone, Harrow-on-the-Hill and South Ruislip would have closed, and {{been converted into a}} road for the exclusive use of buses and coaches. British Rail services via High Wycombe would have been diverted into Paddington, and the Aylesbury services would have been taken over by London Underground on an extended Metropolitan line, and then routed to Baker Street.|$|E
5|$|By the 1820s, {{visitors}} could {{purchase an}} early guidebook {{at the site}} outlining the castle's history, and Victorian tourists recorded being charged six-pence to wander around the castle. In the early 1820s, the antiquarian Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick attempted to purchase the site, with the aim <b>of</b> <b>converting</b> the castle back into a private dwelling, {{but was unable to}} convince the owners to sell. Instead, Meyrick built the neo-gothic Goodrich Court in a similar style next door, which greatly displeased Wordsworth when he returned to Goodrich in 1841 and found the view spoilt by the new building. The new bridge over the river Wye, built in 1828, and the 1873 railway line added to the number of visitors.|$|E

However, that July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes {{called for a}} conference in Washington D.C. to be held that November. The stated goal was to curb the rapidly growing and {{extremely}} expensive naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General Board that the expensive new battlecruisers, which some thought were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring the possibilities <b>of</b> <b>converting</b> {{one or more of}} the battlecruisers to different uses: one looked at a conversion to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated a conversion to an Atlantic ocean liner.|$|E
5|$|Honorius {{consolidated}} {{the work}} <b>of</b> <b>converting</b> the English by sending Felix, a Burgundian, to Dunwich after Felix {{came to the}} archbishop and made known his desire to go to East Anglia as a missionary. Honorius may have consecrated Felix as the first bishop of East Anglia or Felix may have already been consecrated on the continent. The dating of this episode is unclear, but it is probably close to 631. It is possible that King Sigeberht of East Anglia, who converted to Christianity {{while he was in}} exile on the continent, had already met Felix and was behind Felix's journey to Honorius. As well as his help to Felix, Honorius consecrated the first Anglo-Saxon bishop, Ithamar of Rochester, and his successor was also a native of England.|$|E

TEPPCO was purchased by Enterprise Products in 2010. Around 1961, there was discussion <b>of</b> <b>converting</b> the Big Inch pipeline back to petroleum use, but it continued in use as a gas pipeline. In 1989, TETCO was taken over by the Panhandle Eastern Corporation, and in 1997 this company was merged with Duke Power, to form the Duke Energy Corporation; in 2007, the oil pipelines were spun off from Duke Energy, to form part of Spectra Energy Partners.|$|E

Jackson hired long-time collaborator Richard Taylor to lead Weta Workshop on five major design elements: armour, weapons, prosthetics/make-up, creatures, and miniatures. In November 1997, famed Tolkien illustrators Alan Lee and John Howe joined the project. Most of the imagery in the films is based on their various illustrations.

The government's plans meant that the station would cost an extra £40million a year, erasing Rio Tinto Alcan's profits on the station. This has made the station's operators consider the option <b>of</b> <b>converting</b> the power station to operate on biomass only to avoid the penalties. However, this conversion itself would cost 400 million euros million and then using biomass instead of coal would cost an additional £170million a year.|$|E
