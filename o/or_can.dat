5|$|The diver ascends {{along the}} shotline, and may use it purely {{as a visual}} reference, <b>or</b> <b>can</b> {{hold on to it}} to {{positively}} control depth, <b>or</b> <b>can</b> climb up it hand over hand. A Jonline may be used to fasten a diver to an anchor line or shot line during a decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy at their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack. The diver ascends along the shotline, and may use it purely as a visual reference, <b>or</b> <b>can</b> hold on to it to positively control depth, <b>or</b> <b>can</b> climb up it hand over hand. A Jonline may be used to fasten a diver to a shotline during a decompression stop.|$|E

5|$|Boxes play a {{prominent}} role in Crash Bandicoot: Warped and can be broken with all of Crash's techniques. Boxes contain helpful items <b>or</b> <b>can</b> augment Crash's mobility. Check Point boxes allow the player to return to a specific point in the stage upon losing a life. TNT Boxes explode after a three-second fuse when jumped on, while Nitro Boxes explode upon any physical contact. All of the Nitro Boxes in a level can be detonated at once if a green-colored box with an exclamation point (!) on it is touched; contact with this box is necessary in obtaining the level's Gem, as Nitro Boxes count towards the total number of boxes broken in the level.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{many smaller}} Corvus species (such as American crow), ravens prefer {{undisturbed}} montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically {{and they have}} become agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts and grain, <b>or</b> <b>can</b> harm livestock, particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack the faces of young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.|$|E
5|$|Dynamic DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{focuses on}} forming nucleic acid systems with designed dynamic functionalities {{related to their}} overall structures, such as computation and mechanical motion. There is some overlap between structural and dynamic DNA nanotechnology, as structures can be formed through annealing and then reconfigured dynamically, <b>or</b> <b>can</b> be made to form dynamically in the first place.|$|E

Players may choose {{from a number of}} dialog options to speak with her upon the discovery of new interactive objects or environments, <b>or</b> <b>can</b> refrain from communicating. The player's choices will influence the tone of Henry's relationship with Delilah. As the story progresses, new areas will be opened up for players. The game also features a day-night cycle. Objects found in the wilderness can be kept in the inventory for later use.|$|E
5|$|In India carrots {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} ways, as salads or as {{vegetables}} added to spicy rice or dal dishes. A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated and cooked in milk until the whole mixture is solid, after which nuts and butter are added. Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil. Carrots can also be cut in thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables <b>or</b> <b>can</b> be blended with tamarind to make chutney.|$|E
5|$|In Super Mario Kart, {{the player}} takes control {{of one of}} eight Mario series characters, each with differing capabilities. In single player mode players can race against {{computer-controlled}} characters in multi-race cups over three difficulty levels. During the races, offensive and speed boosting power-ups {{can be used to}} gain an advantage. Alternatively players can race against the clock in a Time Trial mode. In multi-player mode two players can simultaneously take part in the cups <b>or</b> <b>can</b> race against each other one-on-one in Match Race mode. In a third multiplayer mode – Battle Mode – the aim is to defeat the other players by attacking them with power-ups, destroying balloons which surround each kart.|$|E

5|$|Like all insects, wasps {{have a hard}} {{exoskeleton}} {{which protects}} their three main body parts, the head, the mesosoma (including the thorax and the first segment of the abdomen) and the metasoma. There is a narrow waist, the petiole, joining {{the first and second}} segments of the abdomen. The two pairs of membranous wings are held together by small hooks and the forewings are larger than the hind ones; in some species, the females have no wings. In females there is usually a rigid ovipositor which may be modified for injecting venom, piercing or sawing. It either extends freely <b>or</b> <b>can</b> be retracted, and may be developed into a stinger for both defence and for paralysing prey.|$|E
5|$|Methods in {{programming}} language are {{the members of}} a class in a project, some methods have signatures and some don't have signatures. Methods can be void <b>or</b> <b>can</b> return something like string, integer, double, decimal, float and bool. If a method is void it means that the method does not return any data type.|$|E
5|$|Most {{mutations}} within {{genes are}} neutral, having {{no effect on}} the organism's phenotype (silent mutations). Some mutations do not change the amino acid sequence because multiple codons encode the same amino acid (synonymous mutations). Other mutations can be neutral if they lead to amino acid sequence changes, but the protein still functions similarly with the new amino acid (e.g. conservative mutations). Many mutations, however, are deleterious or even lethal, and are removed from populations by natural selection. Genetic disorders are the result of deleterious mutations and can be due to spontaneous mutation in the affected individual, <b>or</b> <b>can</b> be inherited. Finally, a small fraction of mutations are beneficial, improving the organism's fitness and are extremely important for evolution, since their directional selection leads to adaptive evolution.|$|E

5|$|Organ stops can be {{combined}} in countless permutations, resulting in {{a great variety of}} sounds. A combination action can be used to switch instantly from one combination of stops (called a registration) to another. Combination actions feature small buttons called pistons that can be pressed by the organist, generally located beneath the keys of each manual (thumb pistons) or above the pedalboard (toe pistons). The pistons may be divisional (affecting only a single division) or general (affecting all the divisions), and are either preset by the organ builder <b>or</b> <b>can</b> be altered by the organist. Modern combination actions operate via computer memory, and can store several channels of registrations.|$|E
5|$|Poetry {{is often}} {{separated}} into lines on a page. These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, <b>or</b> <b>can</b> highlight a change in tone. See the article on line breaks for information about the division between lines.|$|E
5|$|Polar bears can be {{hunted for}} sport in Canada {{with a special}} permit and accompaniment by a local guide. This can be an {{important}} source of income for small communities, as guided hunts bring in more income than selling the polar bear hide on markets. The United States, Russia, Norway, Greenland, and Canada allow subsistence hunting, and Canada distributes hunting permits to indigenous communities. The selling of these permits is a main source of income for many of these communities. Their hides can be used for subsistence purposes, kept as hunting trophies, <b>or</b> <b>can</b> be bought in markets.|$|E

5|$|Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis is a {{realistic}} simulation {{of the sport}} of table tennis. In the game, two players hit a ball {{back and forth from}} one another. The goal of the game is to make the opponent fail to return the ball. Players have the ability to challenge a multiplayer partner, either offline or online, <b>or</b> <b>can</b> select to challenge the game's artificial intelligence. Players can select from a roster of eleven characters, which are unlocked as they progress through the game; each character has particular skills in different areas. The game features two modes: Tournament, which involves players participating against a variety of players in different circuits; and Exhibition, which involves players challenging individual opponents in non-ranked matches.|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{symptoms}} {{resulting from}} anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, <b>or</b> <b>can</b> be delayed for many hours. Such symptoms include nausea, retching and vomiting, abdominal colic and diarrhoea, {{incontinence of urine}} and faeces, sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, blindness, shock, angioedema of the face, lips, gums, tongue, throat and epiglottis, urticaria and bronchospasm. If left untreated, these symptoms may persist or fluctuate for up to 48 hours. In severe cases, cardiovascular failure may occur.|$|E
5|$|The Moran model assumes {{overlapping}} generations. At {{each time}} step, one individual is chosen to reproduce and one individual is chosen to die. So in each timestep, {{the number of}} copies of a given allele can go up by one, go down by one, <b>or</b> <b>can</b> stay the same. This means that the transition matrix is tridiagonal, which means that mathematical solutions are easier for the Moran model than for the Wright–Fisher model. On the other hand, computer simulations are usually easier to perform using the Wright–Fisher model, because fewer time steps need to be calculated. In the Moran model, it takes N timesteps to get through one generation, where N is the effective population size. In the Wright–Fisher model, it takes just one.|$|E
