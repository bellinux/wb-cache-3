5000|$|The hand <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch</b> {{involves}} small diagonal stitches evenly spaced out enclosing {{the fabric}} raw edge.To create an <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch</b> by <b>sewing</b> machine, {{we can use}} an overcast foot, though a regular foot also can be used. The overcast foot has an edge guide which helps the fabric to feed evenly along the edge and a bar in the middle that controls the stitch and makes it lay nice and flat.|$|R

5000|$|In embroidery, an <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch</b> is {{a raised}} line stitch used on even-weave fabrics. It is {{commonly}} used for outlining designs. There are two methods of creating an embroidered <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch.</b> In one method, a line is stitched to create padding, then another thread covers the padding stitches in small stitches {{at right angles to}} the padding stitches. The other method is called detached <b>overcast</b> <b>stitching,</b> and involves two alternating padding stitches that pick up the fabric, followed by <b>overcast</b> <b>stitches</b> that cover the padding stitches without picking up the fabric.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} styles of hems of varying complexities. The most common hem folds up a cut edge, folds it up again, and then sew it down. The style of hemming thus completely encloses the cut edge in cloth, so that it cannot unravel. Other hem styles use fewer folds. One of the simplest hems encloses the edge of cloth with a stitch without any folds at all, using a method called an <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch,</b> although an <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch</b> {{may be used to}} finish a folded [...] "plain hem" [...] as well.|$|R

A presser foot keeps the fabric flat so that it does not rise and fall with the needle and pucker as it is stitched. When especially thick workpieces are to be sewn, such as quilts, a specialized attachment called a walking foot is often used rather than a presser foot.|$|R

The wraps are knitted, transported and assembled by volunteers.Over 30,000 volunteers around Australia {{have been involved in the}} project and more than a quarter of a million woollen wraps have been produced. The wraps are created by knitting 28 equally sized squares in garter <b>stitch,</b> <b>sewn</b> together into blankets of 4 x 7 squares.

30|$|In {{previous}} studies by Rengasamy and Samuel (2011) on needle thread tension for lock-stitch 301, four tension peaks have been signified {{by measuring the}} online tension of stitch formation. They reported that the threads are extended dynamically at the tension peaks mainly when needle descends and penetrate through the fabric during the stitch formation (Rengasamy & Samuel 2011). Especially in stitch tightening; the last step of the stitch formation produces highest tension peak also apply an extension to the sewing thread (Weimer & Mitschang 2001; Rengasamy & Samuel 2011). Thread tension was identified {{as one of the}} important parameters which influence the quality of the seam in garment construction.
