Since radio frequencies are a limited natural resource, which cannot be saved for the future use or transferred from underused to <b>overloaded</b> <b>areas,</b> efficient usage of the frequencies {{has become one of the}} major concerns of the industry, governments, and scientific research. As a result of these research efforts, many different proposals for better and more efficient usage of the radio frequencies have emerged. One of the promising technologies, which could make a big paradigm shift towards the future wireless networks, is a cognitive radio (CR) technology. CR is introduced in [1, 2] and refers to intelligent radio communications system employing technology that allows the system to obtain knowledge of its operational environment, using technology to learn from the environment and dynamically adjust its operational parameters and protocols [3].|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} the daily {{temporal}} and spatial behavior of electric vehicles (EVs) is modelled using an activity-based (ActBM) micro-simulation model for Flanders region (Belgium). Assuming that all EVs are completely charged {{at the beginning of}} the day, this mobility model is used to determine the percentage of Flemish vehicles that cannot cover their programmed daily trips and need to be recharged during the day. Assuming a variable electricity price, an optimization algorithm determines when and where EVs can be recharged at minimum cost for their owners. This optimization takes into account the individual mobility constraint for each vehicle, as they can only be charged when the car is stopped and the owner is performing an activity. From this information, the aggregated electric demand for Flanders is obtained, identifying the most <b>overloaded</b> <b>areas</b> at the critical hours. Finally it is also analyzed what activities EV owners are underway during their recharging period. From this analysis, different actions for public charging point deployment in different areas and for different activities are proposed...|$|E
40|$|Performance and {{scalability}} of distributed simulations depends {{primarily on}} the effectiveness of the employed interest management (IM) schema that aims at reducing the overall computational and messaging effort on the shared data to a necessary minimum. Existing IM approaches, which are based on variations or combinations of two principle data distribution techniques, namely region-based and grid-based techniques, perform poorly if the simulation develops an overloaded host. In order to facilitate distributing the processing load from <b>overloaded</b> <b>areas</b> of the shared data to less loaded hosts, the partition-based technique is introduced that allows for variable-size partitioning the shared data. Based on this data distribution technique, an IM approach is sketched that is dynamically adaptive to access latencies of simulation objects on the shared data {{as well as to the}} physical location of the objects. Since this re-distribution is decided depending on the messaging effort of the simulation objects for updating data partitions, any load balanced constellation has the additional advantage to be of minimal overall messaging effort. Hence, the IM schema dynamically resolves messaging overloading as well as overloading of hosts with simulation objects and therefore facilitates dynamic system scalability...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Iron {{overload}} is {{an inevitable}} consequence of transfusion therapy {{for a variety}} of underlying anemias. Iron overload, without effective chelation, will lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Deferasirox (Exjade®) is an oral tridentate iron chelator used for reducing iron <b>overload.</b> <b>Areas</b> covered: In addition to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of deferasirox, this review examines the efficacy and safety data from pivotal studies with deferasirox in iron-overloaded patients with various anemias, including thalassemia, sickle cell disease and myelodysplastic syndromes. A qualitative literature search for deferasirox was performed using PubMed and recent key congress publications (EHA and ASH); key search terms were deferasirox, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, efficacy and safety. Expert opinion: Based on the current available data, deferasirox treatment is effective with a clinically manageable safety profile although appropriate dosing according to the severity of iron burden and iron intake, together with the careful monitoring of laboratory parameters and adverse events, is recommended. However, despite advances made in the treatment of iron overload, some patients still do not respond adequately to iron chelators, and increased awareness, understanding and further research are still needed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} few years the gap between Internet {{performances}} and users QoS requirement has been continuously increasing. This is caused by the increase of the number of subscribers, and the emergence of new multimedia and real-time applications, such as video-conferencing and telephony, with high needs of bandwidth, end-to-end delay, jitter, security and reliability. In the solution proposed by Manimaran and al. [1] a new distributed routing and reservation algorithm has been proposed. This algorithm improves the call acceptance rate and minimizes the call setup time and the routing distance. This routing algorithm combine two different routing approaches: flooding based approach and preferred neighbour based approach [2][3][4][5]. The goal of merging these two different routing techniques is to reduce the messages overhead induced by the flooding mechanism while taking advantage of the possibility of passing round <b>overloaded</b> <b>areas</b> of the network. Another advantage is {{to limit the number of}} nodes crossed by the flooding messages thanks to the shortest path calculation. These two routing methods are used together by : 1 - selecting a subset of nodes ID(i), ID(i+ 1), [...] ., ID(i+n) along the shortest path from a source to a destination, 2 - sending probe messages from ID(i) to ID(I+ 1) on k preferred paths to discover the best route between these two intermediate nodes, 3 - merging all the intermediate sub-paths in one route from the source to the destination. The authors did not precise how the subset of nodes along the shortest path is selected and several cases, like the mobility of these nodes, are not considered. In this paper, we propose several extensions to this routing algorithm to support fault-tolerance and mobility...|$|E

The time constant of the first order system determines the time delay between changing a set point for the revolutions of the diesel and the change of the real revolutions of the diesel engine.

In these settings, multiple flows of packets with different requirements in terms of transmission rates, bandwidth and jitter demands may be initiated towards the sink. Uncontrolled introduction of traffic from sources can cause network <b>overload</b> in <b>areas</b> of the network where the paths of the different flows interfere with each other. Such interference effects may result in congestion which leads to high packet loss and excessive delays. In this paper, we present CoBRA, a framework which incorporates distributed, cluster-based mechanisms {{to address the problem}} of congestion by enforcing rate control, for supporting multiple classes of traffic in sensor networks. Towards this goal, CoBRA periodically estimates the collective traffic load and, based on the current conditions, allocates and adjusts rates to sources on per-cluster bases. While doing so, CoBRA takes into consideration interference effects and rate requirements of concurrent flows. We have applied two different rate allocation policies using our framework and, through extensive simulation results we demonstrate its feasibility, effectiveness and performance advantages over traditional approaches. ...|$|R

Existing Statistical data on energy supply and demand have a large uncertainty, {{both in terms of}} quantity and costs or price. The available data which were used for this report indicate a wide range both of per capita energy consumption (100 to 2000 kgoe/cap/y) and per capita electricity consumption (50 to 4000 kWh/cap/y). Relative to the average of the European Union, this corresponds to up to 35 times less regarding all energy, and up to 100 times less regarding electricity. Even though electrification made considerable progress in the past 10 years, 600 Mio of rural population has no access to electricity at all.

40|$|Diesel and {{gas turbine}} {{electric}} ship propulsion are of current interest for {{several types of}} vessels that are important for commercial shipping {{and for the next}} generation of war ships. During the design process of a platform, a choice has to be made between two different fundamental concepts regarding propulsion; a conventional arrangement, and a diesel or gas turbine electric propulsion. For both concepts, the electrical installation is present and the demand for additional electric energy becomes a dominant parameter. In both cases, the selection of the prime mover significantly influences the effectiveness of the design. In this thesis, the simulation modeling of a complete propulsion system will be attempted, with overall emphasis on the prime movers. In the first part a diesel engine is considered. The time delay between changing a set point for the revolutions of the engine and the change of the real revolutions is often modeled as a first order system. However, this modeling is too simple to describe the real behavior of the diesel engine. More complex models exist, but in general they are too complex, describing the full thermodynamic behavior of diesels. (cont.) So there is a need for a model that is more advanced than a first order system and less complex than complete thermodynamic models. Such a model has been derived, based on the Seiliger (thermodynamic) process. The results of the model show that the diesel engine behaves like a second order system when operating in the governor area and more like a first order system in the constant torque (<b>overload)</b> <b>area.</b> The simulation model of a diesel engine can be regarded as an explanation of the real engine operation, which combines the mathematical relationship between the relative components and can be used to simulate dynamic loading of the diesel engine. In the second part, a development of a nonlinear gas turbine model for loop- shaping control purposes is presented. The nonlinear dynamic equations of the gas turbine are based on first engineering principles. In order to complete the model, constitutive algebraic equations are also needed. These equations describe the static behavior of the gas turbine at various operating points. (cont.) The complete, substituted nonlinear model is presented along with its model verification results based on a simulator and measured data. A mathematical description for the electric part of the propulsion and energy generation system with respect to numbers of components such as generators and thruster drives is attempted. Other electrical loads may be represented with an aggregate load. Based on the control functions focus on power production, advanced dynamic models shall be used for the generators and simplified static models shall be used for thruster drives and other loads. The final model shall be in a state-space vector form, suitable for control design. As a conclusion, a reliability analysis on the decision for the electric propulsion system is utilized based on market data, speed and electric energy requirements studies. The purpose of this study is to justify the employment of innovative and efficient electric propulsion systems for the future needs of the commercial and naval ship industries. y Charalambos Soultatis.

The cables are designed to withstand up to 250  A which approximately corresponds to around 50 % of PV power penetration. Step down the voltage with the transformer contributes to slightly increasing the load flow through the feeders which may affect the lifetime of the cables and the transformer itself. Fig.  13 depicts the transformer loading level for diverse load and PV power conditions where under the worst-case load scenario, 60 % PV penetration turns the distribution transformer to <b>overloading</b> conditions (shaded <b>area)</b> during peak production hours. In contrast, the transformer loading always remains functioning under its the nominal loading value with 30 % PV integration. Therefore, considering the transformer rating as a limiting parameter, the highest hosting capacity of the network is defined around 40 % corresponding to 140 kVA. The same result is achieved by [8, 12]. The production and demand profiles mismatch limits the network hosting capacity, which still can be enhanced by implementing a load management.|$|R

Mouse models of IVD degeneration were used to investigate {{the role of the}} mechanical stress in this process. The application of mechanical overload (1. 3 MPa) for 24 hours induced annulus fibrosus cell apoptosis and led to severe degeneration of the mouse disks.

40|$|The {{support of}} shared {{awareness}} among users of CSCW-systems has gained considerable attention in recent years. In fact, {{many studies have}} shown that information about the activities of other users is a prerequisite for the success of computer mediated cooperative work. However the implementation of mechanisms to support shared awareness still remains a complex task for designers of distributed multi-user systems. In this book I will present AREA, a service for the provision of awareness information in multi-user environments. A primary goal of AREA is to enable multiple cooperative applications to share and exchange awareness information. This is achieved by offering applications an interface to model a `minimal semantics' of the application domain. Awareness information is modelled by discrete events which are distributed in the electronic workspace. The system notifies users about activities in the shared information space based on interest descriptions that use the metaphor of a situation. Situations are descriptions of work relations {{in the language of the}} application domain. They allow users to individually tailor their awareness preferences to their individual work practice and to avoid information <b>overload.</b> Additionally <b>AREA</b> incorporates global and individual configuration facilities for privacy protection and to ensure compliance with legal and organizational regulations. The book presents POLIAwaC, a groupware prototype which uses the AREA notification service to support awareness among its users.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} histomorphometrically whether or not implant surface nanotopography improves the bone response under immediate loading simultaneous to sinus grafting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dual acid-etched titanium microimplants with/without crystalline surface deposition of calcium phosphate particles were placed in bilateral sinuslift areas grafted {{with a mixture of}} iliac crest bone and BioOss. Surface topography of microimplants was characterized using interferometry. Loaded microimplants (MsL) were immobilized in a provisional bridge supported by four normal size implants. Some patients had unloaded microimplants as controls (MsU). Biopsies were trephined after 2 or 4 months and histomorphometric analysis of bone area (BA) and bone-to-implant contact (BC) was performed. Nonparametric methods for dependent data were used to compare effect of surface modification, and healing time (2 vs. 4 months). RESULTS: A total of 53 biopsies were available from 13 patients. A total of 4 / 28 and 1 / 11 MsL failed after resp. 2 and 4 months vs. 0 / 6 and 1 / 5 MsU. Many loaded biopsies were damaged at the apical portion and showed no bone adhesion. MsL decreased in BA from coronal to apical from 2 to 4 months; Coronal > Middle (P = 0. 047), Coronal > Apical (P Apical (P 0. 05) but doubled both their BA and BIC (P < 0. 05) between 2 and 4 months. CONCLUSIONS: Osseointegration in sinus-grafted bone mixed with BioOss was poor irrespective of healing time or nanotopographical surface modification. The apex of MsL showed minimal bone contact suggesting that the graft does not add to the loading capacity. Surface enhancement was not beneficial despite the enlarged surface <b>area.</b> <b>Overloading,</b> most critical coronally of an implant, increases risks for implant failure and jeopardizes bone healing especially under immediate loading conditions with high load...|$|R
40|$|A fear of {{imminent}} information overload predates the World Wide Web by decades. Yet, that fear has never abated. Worse, as the World Wide Web today takes the lion’s {{share of the}} information we deal with, both in amount and in time spent gathering it, the situation has only become more precarious. This chapter analyses new issues in information overload that have emerged {{with the advent of}} the Web, which emphasizes written communication, defined in this context as the exchange of ideas expressed informally, often casually, as in verbal language. The chapter focuses on three ways to mitigate these issues. First, it helps us, the users, to be more specific in what we ask for. Second, it helps us amend our request when we don't get what we think we asked for. And third, since only we, the human users, can judge whether the information received is what we want, it makes retrieval techniques more effective by basing them on how humans structure information. This chapter reports on extensive experiments we conducted in all three areas. First, to let users be more specific in describing an information need, they were allowed to express themselves in an unrestricted conversational style. This way, they could convey their information need as if they were talking to a fellow human instead of using the two or three words typically supplied to a search engine. Second, users were provided with effective ways to zoom in on the desired information once potentially relevant information became available. Third, a variety of experiments focused on the search engine itself as the mediator between request and delivery of information. All examples that are explained in detail have actually been implemented. The results of our experiments demonstrate how a human-centered approach can reduce information <b>overload</b> in an <b>area</b> that grows in importance with each day that passes. By actually having built these applications, I present an operational, not just aspirational approach...|$|R
30|$|Regarding {{the effect}} of implant design on peri-implant microstrains induced in the present study, {{standard}} diameter implant showed the highest microstrain values regardless of other variables (3362.4 [*]±[*] 757.4  μɛ). Microstrain value exceeded the physiologic limit in the standard implant supporting Lava Ultimate crowns. That was in approval with Balshi et al. who stated that replacing a lost molar with only one implant represents a biomechanical challenge [18]. This might {{be attributed to the}} differences in the size and morphology of natural tooth roots and the standard size implants (3.75 or 4  mm), thus providing insufficient support [19]. In the present study regardless of other variables, double mini implant showed statistically significantly lower mean microstrains (801.6 [*]±[*] 251.4  μɛ) than standard implant. Moreover, the double mini implant showed statistically significantly lowest microstrain values with metal and Lava Ultimate crowns under axial loading. Under off-axial loading, it also showed statistically significant lower microstrains value than standard implant. Moreover, the use of two implants provides more surface area for osseointegration and spreads the occlusal loading forces over a wider area while reducing the potential bending forces that would exist in a single-implant molar restoration [1, 18, 20, 21]. The one-piece design of small-diameter implants (1.8 – 3.0 -mm diameter) provides strength to the implant in comparison with small diameter two-piece implants [22]. According to Misch [23], a solid implant with a 1.23 -mm diameter has the same resistance to bending fracture as the annulus region of a 3.75 -mm traditional design. Moreover, a solid 3 -mm implant has an approximately 340 % increase in moment of inertia over the 3.75 -mm traditional two-piece root form at the annulus position. Generally, short-wide implant resulted in the lowest microstrain values in comparison with the other two implant designs. The reduced strains associated with wider implants {{may be due to the}} increased structural capacity and the enlarged resin-implant contact area offered by these implants, resulting in lower torque effect in conjunction with off-axial loading [20]. Accordingly, Balshi et al. [18] indicated that a molar crown supported by a standard or narrow size implant can easily introduce large bending moments to bone because the dimensions of crown are usually greater than the diameter of the implants. Thus, the wide implant is suggested for placement at the molar region to reduce the possibility of <b>overload.</b> The <b>area</b> that transfers the compressive and tensile loads to bone, that is, functional surface area, was proved to be confined to the crestal 5 – 7  mm [24 – 27]. Thus, short implant with a wider diameter provides both improved primary stability and increased functional surface area as it allows engagement of a maximal amount of bone and better distribution of stress in the surrounding bone compared with increases in implant length [28 – 32]. An increase in diameter by 1  mm will increase the surface area by 30 – 200 % depending on the implant design [33]. Moreover, according to Misch [34], the large-diameter implants which have a larger prosthetic platform exhibit less force transmission.|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in energy cost {{in recent years}} has created a situation where it has become essential to develop alternative energy technologies. Energy efficiency does not only mean reducing environmental degradation and increasing sustainability but also cost savings. Most energy managers employ common solutions to reduce plant inefficiencies in Malaysia such as "Energy Auditing", equipment replacement etc. One other energy efficient system is Cogeneration. Cogeneration can be considered as one of the many indications of progress in a healthy and efficient industrial growth. Cogeneration enables an industry to be not totally dependent on the utility supply but become inter-dependent and hence increasing availability. A well-planned cogeneration system can create a situation where plant operation need not be affected by utility blackouts; i. e. minimum production capacity is maintained. The Malaysian energy environment is a dynamic growth, where present excess capacity is projected to be fully utilised {{by the end of the}} century. The increasing demand for electricity is not evenly distributed in Malaysia and this off balance cause <b>overloading</b> in some <b>areas.</b> By cogenerating, the demand can be reduced and therefore the load on Tenaga Nasional Berhad or TNB transmission lines will also reduce. This would allow TNB to react to load f luctuation more effectively. Cogeneration will be a catalyst for the local natural gas industry since most industrial cogenerators (between 1 MW to 10 MW) will be utilising natural gas as fuel source for gas engines and gas turbines. Cogeneration will also displace the need to build expensive power plants, which will mean eliminating transmission and distribution losses. Cogeneration will benefit the environment by reducing emissions, improve the use of natural resources, introduce better grid management, provide savings in Ringgit Malaysia, increase efficiency, added reliability and generating growth in the gas industry. The objective of this project was to evaluate the technical and economics viability of cogenerating in Malaysia. Two case studies were selected and evaluated. It was found that the lack of firm regulations and gas prices are the main factors discouraging cogeneration in Malaysia. Local industries were also found to be lacking in commitment towards cogenerating and efficient energy use. This thesis has forwarded recommendations and suggestions that will be required to improve the cogeneration scenario in Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} whether early and acquired daily fluid overload (FO), {{as well as}} fluctuations in fluid accumulation, were associated with adverse outcomes in critically ill children with severe sepsis. This study enrolled 202 children in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with severe sepsis. Early fluid overload was defined as ≥ 5 % fluid accumulation occurring in the first 24 hours of PICU admission. The maximum daily fluid accumulation ≥ 5 % occurring during the next 6 days in patients with at least 48 hours of PICU stay was defined as PICU-acquired daily fluid overload. The fluctuation in fluid accumulation was calculated as {{the difference between the}} maximum and the minimum daily fluid accumulation obtained during the first 7 days after admission. Of the 202 patients, 61 (30. 2 %) died during PICU stay. Among all patients, 41 (20. 3 %) experienced early fluid overload, including 9 with a FO ≥ 10 %. Among patients with at least 48 hours of PICU stay (n = 154), 36 (23. 4 %) developed PICU-acquired daily fluid overload, including 2 with a FO ≥ 10 %. Both early fluid overload (AOR = 1. 20; 95 % CI 1. 08 - 1. 33; P = 0. 001; n = 202) and PICU-acquired daily fluid overload (AOR = 5. 47 per log increase; 95 % CI 1. 15 - 25. 96; P = 0. 032; n = 154) were independent risk factors associated with mortality after adjusting for age, illness severity, etc. However, fluctuations in fluid accumulation were not associated with mortality after adjustment. Length of PICU stay increased with greater fluctuations in fluid accumulation in all patients with at least 48 hours of PICU stay (FO < 5 %, 5 %- 10 % vs. ≥ 10 %: 4 [3 - 8], 7 [4 - 11] vs. 10 [6 - 16] days; P < 0. 001; n = 154) and in survivors (4 [3 - 8], 7 [5 - 11] vs. 10 [5 - 15] days; P < 0. 001; n = 121). Early fluid <b>overload</b> achieved an <b>area</b> under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve of 0. 74 (95 % CI 0. 65 - 0. 82; P < 0. 001; n = 202) for predicting mortality in patients with severe sepsis, with a sensitivity of 67. 2 % and a specificity of 80. 1 % at the optimal cut-off value of 2. 65 %. Both early and acquired daily fluid overload were independently associated with PICU mortality in children with severe sepsis...|$|R
