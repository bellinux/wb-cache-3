50|$|In November 1962, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 1761, a {{non-binding}} resolution {{establishing the}} United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid {{and called for}} imposing economic and <b>other</b> <b>sanctions</b> on South Africa.

5000|$|Several {{principles}} may underpin {{decisions about}} criminalization. These include the de minimis principle, {{that of the}} minimum criminalization. Under this principle, the general harm principle fails {{to consider the possibility}} of <b>other</b> <b>sanctions</b> and the effectiveness of criminalization as a chosen option. Those <b>other</b> <b>sanctions</b> include civil courts, laws of tort and regulation. Having criminal remedies in place is seen as a [...] "last resort" [...] since such actions often infringe personal liberties [...] - [...] incarceration, for example, prevents the freedom of movement. In this sense, law making that places a greater emphasis on human rights. Most crimes of direct actions (murder, rape, assault, for example) are generally not affected by such a stance, but it does require greater justification in less clear cases.|$|R

25|$|Mismanagement {{irreparably damaged}} its reputation, {{including}} such practices as not reporting points totals in time, running races late and behind schedule, deliberately scheduling its own events opposite {{the events of}} <b>other</b> <b>sanctioning</b> bodies to weaken their attendance, and a less-than-attentive attitude to members. In its last two years it went through a name change to National BMX Association (NBmxA) in 1979. It tried to reorganize in 1981, starting new tracks and by most accounts had a spark of new energy and enthusiasm, but still suffered lack of ridership (racers were committed to other point races with the <b>other</b> <b>sanctioning</b> bodies). This was to no avail. The NBA, suffering financial difficulties, ceased sanctioning its own races and started joint operations and did merge its membership (but did not merge its management) with the NBL after the 1981 season.|$|R
5000|$|In criminology, the {{de minimis}} or minimalist {{approach}} is {{an addition to}} a general harm principle. The general harm principle fails {{to consider the possibility}} of <b>other</b> <b>sanctions</b> to prevent harm, and the effectiveness of criminalization as a chosen option. Those <b>other</b> <b>sanctions</b> include civil courts, laws of tort and regulation. Having criminal remedies in place is seen as a [...] "last resort" [...] since such actions often infringe personal liberties [...] - [...] incarceration, for example, prevents the freedom of movement. In this sense, law making that places a greater emphasis on human rights, such as the European Convention on Human Rights fall into the de minimis category. Most crimes of direct actions (murder, rape, assault, for example) are generally not affected by such a stance, but it does require greater justification in less clear cases.|$|R
