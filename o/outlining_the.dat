This was followed up with applications and instructions sent by mail.

5|$|The {{narrative}} {{draws on}} various Romantic literary traditions, {{such as the}} comedy of manners, the Gothic tale, and the Byronic hero. The novel's language is a pastiche of 19th-century writing styles, {{such as those of}} Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. Clarke describes the supernatural with careful detail.

5|$|At this point, Cochrane has {{completed}} {{the first two}} steps introducing his interest-based rights approach; the third is <b>outlining</b> <b>the</b> approach itself as the appropriate means of understanding obligations to animals in political communities. Utilitarianism, as advocated by Peter Singer, is rejected because of its failure to take individuals seriously enough; Cochrane desires an account which takes well-being seriously but is not purely aggregative. This, he suggests, is one based on interest rights. After explicating {{the details of his}} interest-based rights approach, Cochrane defends it against the charge that it would result in an unworkably large number of rights, and that rights approaches are too rationalistic.|$|E
5|$|Author Walter Noble Burns visited Earp in September 1926 {{and asked}} him {{questions}} {{with the intent to}} write a book about Earp. Earp declined because he was already collaborating with John Flood. Burns visited Tombstone and based on what he learned decided instead to focus his book on Doc Holliday.

A truck driver's log book is a legally defined form containing a grid <b>outlining</b> <b>the</b> 24-hour day into 15-minute increments. The driver must specify where and when he/she stopped between driving shifts, what duties were performed (if any), along with the driver's name, truck number, company info, and other information. The driver must also present his or her log book to authorities upon request, for inspection. In lieu of a log book, a motor carrier may substitute an electronic on-board recorder to record the driver's hours.|$|E
5|$|Restoration {{work was}} carried out in the 1830s by William Craven, the Earl of Craven. This was a {{deliberate}} attempt at conserving the existing building, rather than rebuilding it, and was a very unusual approach at this time. By 1845, stone buttresses and pillars had been added to support parts of the hall and its roof. Research by Thomas Turner was published in 1851, <b>outlining</b> <b>the</b> history of the castle. Frances Stackhouse Acton, a local landowner, took a particular interest in the castle, and in 1853 convinced William to carry out further repair work on the castle, under her supervision, at a cost of £103.|$|E
5|$|The British, Americans and Soviet Union {{discussed}} the proposal. British Foreign Secretary (later Prime Minister) Anthony Eden wrote a memo on 26 June <b>outlining</b> <b>the</b> options. The British were convinced {{they were dealing}} with a Himmler trick, perhaps an attempt to broker a peace deal without the Soviet Union. If the deal had gone ahead and large numbers of Jews had been released in central Europe, Allied airborne and possibly land-based military operations might have had to stop. Bauer believes the British feared this was Himmler's motive– to turn the Jews into human shields– because it would have allowed the Germans to devote their forces to fighting the Red Army.|$|E

5|$|The FMCSA is a {{division}} of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), which is generally responsible for enforcement of FMCSA regulations. The driver of a CMV is required to keep a record of working hours using a log book, <b>outlining</b> <b>the</b> total number of hours spent driving and resting, as well as the time at which the change of duty status occurred. In lieu of a log book, a motor carrier may keep track of a driver's hours using Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs), which automatically record {{the amount of time spent}} driving the vehicle.|$|E

In most cases, a simple majority of Parliament is all that is needed for the bill to be approved. However, bills seeking to amend the Constitution must be carried by a special majority: not less than two-thirds of all MPs on the second and third readings.|$|E
5|$|The defections to the Mexican {{league and}} the threat of a strike by the Pirates {{prompted}} owners to form an advisory committee, chaired by Larry MacPhail, to suggest needed changes that would calm the discontent among the players. On August 27, 1946, the committee presented a draft a document <b>outlining</b> <b>the</b> changes. Language in the original draft admitted that baseball was operating as a monopoly and that racial bias was the sole reason for segregation in baseball. Baseball's attorneys stripped this controversial language from the version eventually adopted by the owners.|$|E

5|$|With {{only a small}} local {{population}} during medieval times, {{as a result of}} the introduction of industry, mass migration of village workers into Oldham occurred, resulting in a population change from under 2,000 in 1714 to 12,000 in 1801 to 137,000 in 1901 In 1851 its population of 52,820 made Oldham the 12th most populous town in England. The following is a table <b>outlining</b> <b>the</b> population change of the town since 1801, which demonstrates a trend of rapid population growth in the 19th century and, after peaking at 147,483 people in 1911, a trend of general decline in population size during the 20th century.|$|E
