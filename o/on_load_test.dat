40|$|Abstract — Load {{testing is}} crucial to uncover {{functional}} and performance bugs in large-scale systems. Load tests generate vast amounts of performance data, which needs to be compared and analyzed in limited time across tests. This helps performance analysts to understand the resource usage of an application {{and to find out}} if an application is meeting its performance goals. The biggest challenge for performance analysts is to identify the few important performance counters in the highly redundant performance data. In this paper, we employed a statistical technique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the large volume of performance counter data, to a smaller, more meaningful and manageable set. Furthermore, our methodology automates the process of comparing the important counters across load tests to identify performance gains/losses. A case study <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> data of a large enterprise application shows that our methodology can effectively guide performance analysts to identify and compare top performance counters across tests in limited time.

During the load test, analyst strictly monitor and record thousands of performance counters to measure the run time system properties such as CPU utilization, Disk I/O, memory consumption, network traffic etc. The most frustrating problem faced by analysts is the time spent and complexity involved in analysing these huge counter logs and finding relevant information distributed across thousands of counters. We present our methodology to help analysts by automatically identifying important performance counters for load test and comparing them across tests to find performance gain/loss. Further, our methodology help analysts to understand the root cause of a load test failure by finding previously solved problems in test repositories.

40|$|Abstract—Enterprise {{systems are}} load tested for every added feature, {{software}} updates and periodic maintenance {{to ensure that}} the performance demands on system quality, availability and responsiveness are met. In current practice, performance analysts manually analyze load test data to identify the components that are responsible for performance deviations. This process is time consuming and error prone due to the large volume of performance counter data collected during monitoring, the limited operational knowledge of analyst about all the subsystem involved and their complex interactions and the unavailability of up-to-date documentation in the rapidly evolving enterprise. In this paper, we present an automated approach based on a robust statistical technique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify subsystems that show performance deviations in load tests.

40|$|Abstract—Large scale systems (LSS) contain {{multiple}} subsystems that interact {{across multiple}} nodes in sometimes unforeseen and complicated ways. As a result, pinpointing the subsystems {{that are the}} source of performance degradation for a load test in LSS can be frustrating, and might take several hours or even days. This is due to the large volume of performance counter data collected such as CPU utilization, Disk I/O, memory consumption and network traffic, the limited operational knowledge of analysts about all subsystems of an LSS and the unavailability of up-to-date documentation in a LSS. We have developed a methodology that automatically ranks the subsystems according to the deviation of their performance in a load test. Our methodology uses performance counter data of a load test to craft performance signatures for the LSS subsystems. Pair-wise correlations among the performance signatures of subsystems within a load test are compared with the corresponding correlations in a baseline test to pinpoint the subsystems responsible for the performance violations. Case studies <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> data obtained from a large telecom system an open source benchmark application show that our approach provides an accuracy of 79 % and our approach don’t require any instrumentation or domain knowledge to operate.

40|$|Abstract—Load {{testing is}} one of the means for {{evaluating}} the performance of Large Scale Systems (LSS). At the end of a load test, performance analysts must analyze thousands of performance counters from hundreds of machines under test. These performance counters are measures of run-time system properties such as CPU utilization, Disk I/O, memory consumption, and network traffic. Analysts observe counters {{to find out if the}} system is meeting its Service Level Agreements (SLAs). In this paper, we present and evaluate one supervised and three unsupervised approaches to help performance analysts to 1) more effectively compare load tests in order to detect performance deviations which may lead to SLA violations, and 2) to provide them with a smaller and manageable set of important performance counters to assist in root-cause analysis of the detected deviations. Our case study is based <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> data obtained from both a large scale industrial system and an open source benchmark application. The case study shows, that our wrapper-based supervised approach, which uses a search-based technique to find the best subset of performance counters and a logistic regression model for deviation prediction, can provide up to 89 % reduction in the set of performance counters while detecting performance deviations with few false positives (i. e., 95 % average precision). The study also shows that the supervised approach is more stable and effective than the unsupervised approaches but it has more overhead due to its semi-automated training phase.

Para estacas o controle Ã, em geral, feito com base em de prova de carga. Este trabalho propÃe uma formulaÃÃo empÃrica para previsÃo da capacidade de carga de estacas tipo raiz, obtidas por meio de algumas variÃveis monitoradas durante a execuÃÃo das mesmas utilizando um velocÃmetro digital. Para isso foram {{realizadas}} provas de carga estÃticas lentas em trÃs estacas raiz monitoradas, com diÃmetros de 350 e 410 mm. Diversas combinaÃÃes entre as parcelas da capacidade de carga de ponta e lateral e as variÃveis monitoradas foram testadas, utilizando-se os programas de computador Excel e Maple. Posteriormente foi buscada uma expressÃo para a previsÃo da carga de ruptura das estacas ensaiadas, como uma funÃÃo das variÃveis monitoradas, segundo relaÃÃes do tipo polinomial, exponencial, logarÃtmica e combinaÃÃo linear, tendo como referÃncia o valor obtido de acordo com o mÃtodo da Norma ABNT NBR 6122 : 2010. Foi verificado que hÃ correlaÃÃo entre a capacidade de carga e as variÃveis monitoradas. As variÃveis que melhor se ajustaram na correlaÃÃo foram: rotaÃÃo e velocidade de avanÃo. Os resultados obtidos pela expressÃo proposta foram concordantes com os valores de referÃncia para as estacas ensaiadas. O mÃtodo de Lizzi (1982) apresentou estimativas mais concordantes com os resultados obtidos na formulaÃÃo proposta que correlaciona capacidade de carga e variÃveis envolvidas no processo executivo.

For that were made slow static load tests in three root cuttings monitored at 350 and 410 mm. Several combinations of the parts of the peak load capacity and the side and monitored variables were tested, using computer programs Excel and Maple. It was later sought an expression for predicting the tensile strength of the tested cuttings as a function of the variables monitored, according to relations of type polynomial, exponential, logarithmic and combination linear, with reference to the value obtained according to the method of the ABNT NBR 6122 : 2010. It was found that there is a correlation between the load and the variables monitored. The variables that best fit the correlation were spin and speed advance. The results obtained with the expression proposed were consistent with the values reference to the tested cuttings. The method of Lizzi (1982) presented estimates more consistent with the results obtained in the form proposed that correlates capacity load and variables involved in enforcement proceedings...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of natural soil are inherently variable and influence design decisions in geotechnical engineering. Apart from the inherent variability of the soil, the variability may arise due to measurement of soil {{properties in the}} field or laboratory tests and model errors. These wide ranges of variability in soil are {{expressed in terms of}} mean, variance and autocorrelation function using probability/reliability based models. The most common term used in reliability based design is the reliability index, which is a probabilistic measure of assurance of performance of structure. The main objective of the reliability based design is to quantify probability of failure/reliability of a geotechnical system considering variability in the design parameters and associated safety. In foundation design, reliability based design is useful compared to deterministic factor of safety approach. Several design codes of practice recommend the use of limit state design concept based on probabilistic models, and suggest that, development of reliability based design methodologies for practical use are of immense value. The objective of the present study is to propose reliability based design methodologies for pile foundations under static and seismic loads. The work presented in this dissertation is subdivided into two parts, namely design of pile foundations under static vertical and lateral loading; and design of piles under seismic loading, embedded in non-liquefiable and liquefiable soil. The significance of consideration of variability in soil parameters in the design of pile foundation is highlighted. A brief review of literature is presented in Chapter 2 on current pile design methods under vertical, lateral and seismic loads. It also identifies the scope of the work. Chapter 3 discusses the methods of analysis which are subsequently used for the present study. Chapter 4 presents the reliability based design methodology for vertically and laterally loaded piles based on cone penetration test data for cohesive soil. CPT data from Konaseema area in India is used for analysis. Ultimate limit sate and serviceability limit state are considered for reliability based design using CPT data and load displacement curves. Chapter 5 presents the load resistance factor design (LRFD) of vertically and laterally loaded piles based <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> data. Reliability based code calibrated partial factors are determined considering bias in failure criteria, model bias and variability in load and resistance. Chapter 6 illustrates a comprehensive study on the effect of soil spatial variability on response of vertically and laterally loaded pile foundations in undrained clay. Two-dimensional finite difference program, FLAC 2 D (Itasca 2005) is used to model the soil and pile. The response of pile foundations due to the effect of variance and spatial correlation of undrained shear strength is studied using Monte Carlo simulation. The influence of spatial variability on the propagation and formation of failure near the pile foundation is also examined. Chapter 7 describes reliability based design methodology of piles in non-liquefiable soil. The seismic load on pile foundation is determined from code specified elastic design response spectrum using pseudo-static approach. Variability in seismic load and soil undrained shear strength are incorporated. The effects of soil relative densities, pile diameters, earthquake predominant frequencies and peak acceleration values on the two plausible failure mechanisms; bending and buckling are examined in Chapter 8. The two-dimensional finite difference analysis is used for dynamic analysis. A probabilistic approach is proposed to identify governing failure modes of piles in liquefiable soil in Chapter 9. The variability in the soil parameters namely SPT-N value, friction angle, shear modulus, bulk modulus, permeability and shear strain at 50 % of modulus ratio is considered. Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the probability of failure. A well documented case of the failed pile of Showa Bridge in 1964 Niigata earthquake is considered as case example. Based on the studies reported in this dissertation, it can be concluded that the reliability based design of pile foundations considering variability and spatial correlation of soil enables a rational choice of design loads. The variability in the seismic design load and soil shear strength can quantify the risk involved for pile design in a rational basis. The identification of depth of liquefiable soil layer is found to be most important to identify failure mechanisms of piles in liquefiable soil. Considerations of soil type, earthquake intensity, predominant frequency of earthquake, pile material, variability of soil are also significant...|$|E

How {{to characterize the}} cross-site variability of the model bias factor is important for design of pile foundations based <b>on</b> site-specific <b>load</b> <b>test</b> data. In this study, a probabilistic model that allows for explicit modeling of the cross-site variability is suggested. An equation is derived based on Bayes' theorem to calibrate the suggested model with <b>load</b> <b>test</b> data from different sites, which is applicable even {{when the number of}} <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> at each site is small. A procedure based on hybrid Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation is employed to solve the Bayesian equation. How to update the statistics of the model bias factor, when applied to a future site, with site-specific <b>load</b> <b>test</b> data is also described. As an illustration, the probabilistic model is applied to the design of bored piles in Shanghai, China. It is found that, given a certain number of site-specific pile <b>load</b> <b>tests,</b> the effect of updating depends on the mean and the COV of the measured model bias factor. With the assistance of regional experience, a small number of <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> can significantly reduce the uncertainty associated with the design model, and further {{increase in the number of}} <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> may not change the site-specific statistics of the bias factor and hence the resistance factor substantially.

40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} {{studies of the}} response of steels to high strain rates were performed. The study was initiated by {{the increase in the}} structural performance of gun launched vehicles of heat treated SAE 4340 steel above that predicted. A test technique was developed to simulate gun launch loadings, that permitted monitoring of the <b>load</b> <b>on</b> <b>test</b> specimen throughout the <b>load</b> cycle. <b>Tests</b> were carried out on SAE 4340 steel heat treated to various hardnesses.
