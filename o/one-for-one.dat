5|$|In {{contrast}} to these materialistic views, Aristotelianism considered all natural things as actualisations of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms. This {{was part of}} a medieval teleological understanding of nature in which all things have an intended role to play in a divine cosmic order. Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and were integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real types of organisms always correspond <b>one-for-one</b> with exact metaphysical forms and specifically gave examples of how new types of living things could come to be.|$|E
5|$|The Oerlikon 20 mm {{anti-aircraft}} gun {{was one of}} the most heavily produced {{anti-aircraft gun}}s of the Second World War; the US alone manufactured a total of 124,735 of these guns.

5|$|The Oerlikon 20 mm {{anti-aircraft}} gun, one of {{the most}} heavily produced anti-aircraft guns of the Second World War, entered service in 1941, and replaced the /90 M2 Browning MG on a <b>one-for-one</b> basis. Between December 1941 and September 1944, 32% of all Japanese aircraft downed were credited to this weapon, with the high point being 48.3% for the second half of 1942; however, the 20mm guns were found to be ineffective against the Japanese Kamikaze attacks used during the latter half of World War II and were subsequently phased out in favor of the heavier Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft gun.|$|E
5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} doxorubicin, called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for <b>one-for-one</b> (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E

25|$|The High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), {{which first}} entered service in 1985, was {{developed}} during the Cold War when improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and asymmetric warfare were not a major factor for military planners.

JLTV was originally reported as a <b>one-for-one</b> HMMWV replacement; however, US DOD officials now emphasize that JLTVs are not intended to replace all HMMWVs.|$|E
25|$|The head tracker {{registers}} {{the translation}} and {{rotation of the}} user's head. Pointman uses these inputs to map {{the movements of the}} user's head and torso <b>one-for-one</b> to those of his avatar. The virtual view changes as the user turns his head to look around or leans his torso in any direction. When the weapon is raised into an aim position its sights remain centered in the field of view, so that turning the head also adjusts the aim. The user can aim as precisely as he can hold his head on target. Hunching the head down by flexing the spine is also registered by the head's translation, and the avatar adopts a matching posture. Leaning forward and hunching are used to duck behind cover. Rising up and leaning to the side are used to look out and shoot from behind cover.|$|E
25|$|The Toronto Blue Jays {{acquired}} Marco Estrada, Devon Travis, Josh Donaldson, and Michael Saunders via trades. The Estrada {{trade was}} a <b>one-for-one</b> swap of Estrada and Adam Lind, {{who went to}} Milwaukee Brewers after the Blue Jays exercised the option on his contract. In addition, both the Travis and Saunders trades were single-player deals. Travis came to Toronto for Anthony Gose, {{who went to the}} Detroit Tigers, and Saunders was exchanged for J. A. Happ, who was dealt to the Seattle Mariners. Toronto acquired Donaldson in a five–player trade, sending Brett Lawrie, Kendall Graveman, Sean Nolin, and Franklin Barreto to Oakland Athletics. Barreto played for the Vancouver Canadians in Single A in 2014, while Graveman and Nolin were September additions to the Blue Jays' roster. Toronto spoke to Arizona Diamondbacks about Wade Miley and Mark Trumbo. However, the trade never took place. Toronto wanted Trumbo to trade for Saunders.|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{elements}} of P themselves correspond <b>one-for-one</b> with bounded lattice homomorphisms from J(P) to 2.

And, for any lattice homomorphism from J(P) to 2, {{the elements}} of J(P) that are mapped to 1 must have a unique minimal element x (the meet of all elements mapped to 1), which must be join-irreducible (it cannot be the join of any set of elements mapped to 0), so every lattice homomorphism has the form jx for some x. Again, from any bounded lattice homomorphism h from J(P) to J(Q) one may use [...] composition of functions to define an order-preserving map h* from Q to P. It may be verified that g**=g for any order-preserving map g from Q to P and that and h**=h for any bounded lattice homomorphism h from J(P) to J(Q).|$|E
2500|$|In September 2007, The Times-Picayune {{reported}} that Vitter and the Bush administration opposed a provision of The Gulf Coast Housing Recovery bill which required that every public housing apartment torn down {{be replaced with}} another form of low-income housing on a <b>one-for-one</b> basis. The administration testified {{that there was not}} sufficient demand for public housing units, a position contested by several senators. Vitter stated it would recreate [...] "housing projects exactly as they were", isolated and riddled with crime. However, Mary Landrieu, the Louisiana Democratic Senator, said the intent was to make certain there were affordable places for working-class people who returned. The bill requires that demolished housing projects be replaced with mixed income communities which local housing advocates say is different from the massive public housing developments that Vitter is referring to. However, the bill does not include a ban on large-scale projects. The city housing authority is planning on replacing 4,000 low-income units with mixed-income projects providing a smaller inventory of low-income units. In December 2007, Vitter prevented the bill from leaving the committee.|$|E
2500|$|From {{continuing}} to use sterling after independence (1922), the new Irish Free State brought {{in its own}} currency from 1928. [...] The new [...] (Free State) Pound was defined by the 1927 Act to have exactly the same weight and fineness of gold as was the sovereign at the time, having the effect of making the new currency pegged at 1:1 with sterling. [...] rather than , parity with sterling was maintained for another fifty years. As with sterling, the £sd system was used, with the Irish names [...] (plural: [...] ), [...] (plural: [...] ) and [...] (plural: [...] ). Distinctive coins and notes were introduced, the coins from 1928 (in 8 denominations: d farthing, d halfpenny, 1d penny, 3d threepence, 6d sixpence, 1s shilling, 2s florin, 2s 6d half crown and in 1966 a 10s coin) all with the same dimensions as their British counterparts.

2500|$|The Army placed {{importance}} on the GCV's {{ability to carry}} a full nine-man squad. [...] Numerous Army studies have concluded that a squad, containing two fireteams, should be composed of nine to eleven soldiers. [...] These numbers allow the squad to accomplish the fire and maneuver doctrine, and for squad resilience, lethality, and leader span of control. [...] The M2 Bradley cannot carry a complete squad from one vehicle, creating risk when transitioning from mounted to dismounted operations. [...] The Bradley's lower carrying capacity was accepted for greater (than previous vehicles) mounted lethality and cost savings, leading to squads being broken apart for transport. [...] A GCV with a nine-man squad would have allowed the squad leader to control and communicate with the squad while mounted, simplify the transition to dismounted operations in complex terrain, and allow the squad to conduct independent fire and maneuver immediately upon dismount. [...] Replacing the Bradley on a <b>one-for-one</b> basis would have four GCVs per mechanized infantry platoon carrying one full nine-man squad in a single vehicle, with three vehicles carrying squads and one carrying the platoon's organic and attached enablers.|$|E
2500|$|Difficulties {{arise when}} {{transliteration}} or transcription between writing systems is required. Some well-known places have well-established names in other languages and writing systems, such as Russia or Rußland for Росси́я, {{but in other}} cases a system of transliteration or transcription is required. Even in the former case, the exclusive use of an exonym may be unhelpful for the map user. It will not be much use for an English user of a map of Italy to show Livorno only as [...] "Leghorn" [...] when road signs and railway timetables show it as [...] "Livorno". In transliteration, the characters in one script are represented by characters in another. For example, the Cyrillic letter Р is usually written as R in the Latin script, although in many cases {{it is not as}} simple as a <b>one-for-one</b> equivalence. Systems exist for transliteration of Arabic, but the results may vary. For example, the Yemeni city of Mocha is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-Mukhā, Mocca and Moka. Transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another, while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another. Chinese writing is now usually converted to the Latin alphabet through the Pinyin phonetic transcription systems. Other systems were used in the past, such as Wade-Giles, resulting in the city being spelled Beijing on newer English maps and Peking on older ones.|$|E
2500|$|Let 2 {{denote the}} partial {{order on the}} two-element set {0, 1}, with the order {{relation}} 0 < 1, and (following Stanley) let J(P) denote the distributive lattice of lower sets of a finite partial order P. Then the elements of J(P) correspond <b>one-for-one</b> to the order-preserving functions from P to 2. For, if ƒ is such a function, ƒ−1(0) forms a lower set, and conversely if L is a lower set one may define an order-preserving function ƒL that maps L to 0 and that maps the remaining elements of P to 1. If g is any order-preserving function from Q to P, one may define a function g* from J(P) to J(Q) that uses the composition of functions to map any element L of J(P) to [...] ƒL∘g. This composite function maps Q to 2 and therefore corresponds to an element g*(L)=(ƒL∘g)−1(0) of J(Q). Further, for any x and y in J(P), g*(x∧y)=g*(x)∧g*(y) (an element of Q is mapped by g to the lower set x∩y {{if and only if}} belongs both to the set of elements mapped to x and the set of elements mapped to y) and symmetrically g*(x∨y)=g*(x)∨g*(y). Additionally, the bottom element of J(P) (the function that maps all elements of P to 0) is mapped by g* to the bottom element of J(Q), and the top element of J(P) is mapped by g* to the top element of J(Q). That is, g* is a homomorphism of bounded lattices.|$|E
