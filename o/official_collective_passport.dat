40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{divisive}} impact of <b>official</b> <b>collective</b> memory upon {{the position of}} the Kurdish minority in the Turkish society. Contextualized in the recent upsurge of violence in Turkey, this paper emphasises the role of memory in constructing conflict. Turkish <b>official</b> <b>collective</b> memory cultivates anxiety concerning the ‘other’ through emphasising religious or ethnic differences with the majority, ethnic Turks. The impact of Turkish <b>official</b> <b>collective</b> memory does not go unchallenged, Halil Altindere, a Turkish Kurdish artist presents a counter-memory to the state in his critical artwork «Welcome to the Land of the Lost ». Altindere’s artwork in the form of postage stamps, depicts the missing faces and names of twelve victims of the 17, 000 missing under state custody in the 1990 s. Unrecognised and unremembered, Altindere undermines <b>official</b> <b>collective</b> memory by depicting state violence to the Turkish audience. This paper outlines how Altindere’s work diverges from <b>official</b> <b>collective</b> memory, by calling for commemoration, recognition, and acceptance of minorities in Turkish society. Altindere’s protest against <b>official</b> <b>collective</b> memory engages the Turkish public, by questioning their anxiety in their identity and the ‘other’...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This article {{explores the}} inter-relationship of {{collective}} action within the business community, {{the nature of}} the political regime and the security of firms’ property rights. Drawing on a pair of surveys recently administered in Russia, we present evidence that post-communist business associations have begun to coordinate business influence over state actors {{in a manner that is}} sensitive to regional politics. A firm’s ability to defend itself from government predation and to shape its institutional environment as well as its propensity to invest in physical capital are strongly related to both its membership in a business association and the level of democratization in its region. Of particular note, the positive effect of association membership on securing property rights increases in less democratic regions. The evidence, that is, suggests that collective action in the business community substitutes for democratic pressure in constraining public <b>officials.</b> <b>collective</b> action; property rights; political institutions; business associations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis article investigates {{whether and}} how social {{dialogue}} has influenced austerity policies in French local government, with a particular focus on municipalities. With regard to local government staff, social dialogue takes place at two levels, with wage and general rules being discussed at national level and working conditions and individual career issues at local level. National-level measures, as in many countries, have included unilateral wage freezes. However, though staff reductions have already occurred in the state administration, they have not (yet) affected municipalities. As seen in our case study, {{when it comes to}} local-level austerity measures such as cuts in services and restructuring measures, we are witnessing a situation of real bargaining – including conflict and formalized agreements. Even if not leading to <b>official</b> <b>collective</b> agreements, this strengthens the role of formal committees and suggests the potential resilience of social dialogue linked to the proximity of decision-making authorities and affected citizens...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{relation}} between the museum and the notion of identity through a study of patrimonial logics which aim at forging an <b>official</b> <b>collective</b> memory. We rely on a study of the mediation function of central museums in building a national identity through an endeavor to shape a "nation-memory" ("mémoire-nation", Pierre Nora) which draws on peasant sources. The stake of this study lies in its ability to bring to light institutional forms of patrimony in the era of nationalist ideologies, of the formation and consolidation of the nation state. In which ways is the relationship between patrimony and national identity embodied in the scientific patrimonial projects of the museums? In trying to answer this question, we set out to explore how the patrimony is exploited in order to foster political projects. Addressing the issue of central museums as a kind of ”surface” where the collective identity is "scratched" will help us shed lights on the metamorphoses of a "localizing memory" ("mémoire localisante", M. M. Carruthers) mobilized to build a shared identity...|$|R

50|$|The union {{struggled}} for graduate student support until February 1969, when Wisconsin State Assembly majority leader Republican Representative John C. Shabaz proposed {{a bill to}} remove tuition remission for graduate students on assistantship. The bill was introduced during the black strike {{as a component of}} a conservative strategy to rout out out-of-state UW students, a group blamed for campus discontent. While the faculty thought the bill wouldn't pass or would otherwise be vetoed, the TAA pledged to fight the bill and proposed that they become the TAs' <b>official</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining unit. Within weeks, they collected 1,100 members from 1,900 TAs and approached the university for recognition as the teaching assistants' bargaining agent. Citing a lack of legislative approval, campus chancellor H. Edwin Young declined, but reneged when a consequential strike loomed later in the semester. Young offered to bargain if a vote administered by the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission upheld the TAA's claim of majority representation. After two days of elections, the union became the students' official bargaining agent on May 18, 1969, with 77% of voters overall in support and 52 of 81 academic departments with TAs in majority consensus. With threats of striking, the Shabaz bill was rescinded.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a critical}} exploration of the changing social world of policy-making in the British central government. It examines new forms of governance that engage international corporations and non-governmental organisations into the making of state policy in the UK. It focuses on a case of one transnationally mobile blueprint for a collaborative anti-corruption policy. Implemented in the Whitehall, this policy, called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), has had profound effects on how government officials exercise their authority. I describe the EITI as a densely scripted model for policy, organised around an infrastructure of <b>official</b> <b>collective</b> forms, which structurally gear its implementation to consensual deliberation. I suggest that this formal set-up makes necessary constant social work of negotiating difference and maintaining relationships. This leads me {{to argue that the}} institutions of the UK EITI not only provide a social and political forum for the negotiation of disclosure rules, but set in motion complex social and political dynamics, and engender epistemic and ethical dilemmas, that simultaneously contributed to, and undermined, policy-making. My dissertation sheds new light on the increasingly networked, transnational character of ‘domestic’ policy-making. It analyses the political, social and affective dimensions of collaborative policy-making, and explains how ethical and epistemic dilemmas that arise from collaboration of civil servants and their ‘stakeholders’, affect the policy. Opening up the ‘black box’ of the UK EITI in order to recuperate its sociality and understand the agency of official abstractions enabling it, this thesis explores how British civil servants and their expert stakeholders, navigate the terrain of statecraft transformed by their collaboration. Collaboration, I contend, transforms policy-making because it brings into play social interests, relations, and practices, which are rarely associated with state bureaucracies. At the same time, the ways in which this collaboration is formally organised, restrict the government’s control over the policy that it makes. Affecting policy-making within the government, collaboration results in processes of governance beyond government...|$|R
