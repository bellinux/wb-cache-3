5|$|After Pierce died, he mostly {{passed from}} the American consciousness, except as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of presidents whose {{disastrous}} tenures led to civil war.

The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in C-SPAN surveys (2000 and 2009). Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Although he did not lead that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation. The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped {{bring an end to the}} dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics.|$|E
5|$|Also {{on display}} is a burden basket created by basketmaker Sophie George {{in the design}} of the baskets used by the Kalapuya, the Native American tribe that {{formerly}} inhabited the Tualatin Valley.
