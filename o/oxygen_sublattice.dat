Beta alumina solid {{electrolyte}} material is conventionally synthesized {{by the high}} temperature solid state reaction of α-Al₂O₃ with soda and a stabilizer ion such as lithia or magnesia.

Four different aluminium hydroxide precursors were synthesized by the controlled hydrolysis of a common aluminium isopropoxide parent material.

Here, we show two examples of stabilization of novel structural phases by manipulating the <b>oxygen</b> <b>sublattices</b> in complex Cu-based oxide thin films grown on SrTiO 3 : (i) epitaxial strain stabilization of a near cubic form of CuO and (ii) thickness-dependent structural transformation from bulk planar (polar) to chain-type (nonpolar) in SrCuO 2 thin films that relieves the electrostatic instability.

Widespread {{disagreement}} exists in the geoscience community how these signals can be generated in the Earth's crust and whether they are early warning signs, related to the build-up of tectonic stresses before major seismic events. Progress in understanding and eventually using these signals has been slow because the underlying physical process or processes are basically not understood. This has changed with the discovery that, when igneous or high-grade metamorphic rocks are subjected to deviatoric stress, dormant electronic charge carriers are activated: electrons and defect electrons. The activation increases the number density of mobile charge carriers in the rocks and, hence, their electric conductivity. The defect electrons {{are associated with the}} <b>oxygen</b> anion <b>sublattice</b> and are known as positive holes or pholes for short.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{mechanism}} for the low frequency electromagnetic emissions and other electromagnetic phenomena which {{have been associated with}} earthquakes. The mechanism combines the critical earthquake concept and the concept of crust acting as a charging electric battery under increasing stress. The electric charges are released by activation of dormant charge carriers in the <b>oxygen</b> anion <b>sublattice,</b> called peroxy bonds or positive hole pairs (PHP), where a PHP represents an O_ 3 X/^OO YO_ 3 with X,Y = Si^ 4 +, Al^ 3 + [...] ., i. e. an O^- in a matrix of O^ 2 - of silicates. We propose that PHP are activated by plastic deformations during the slow cooperative build-up of stress and the increasingly correlated damage culminating in a large "critical" earthquake. Recent laboratory experiments indeed show that stressed rocks form electric batteries which can release their charge when a conducting path closes the equivalent electric circuit. We conjecture that the intermittent and erratic occurrences of EM signals are a consequence of the progressive build-up of the battery charges in the Earth crust and their erratic release when crack networks are percolating throughout the stressed rock volumes, providing a conductive pathway for the battery currents to discharge. EM signals are thus expected close to the rupture, either slightly before or after, that is, when percolation is most favored.
