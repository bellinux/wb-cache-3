500|$|Dreaming <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>is</b> {{the fifth}} and final studio album by American singer Selena. Released posthumously on July 18, 1995 by EMI Latin and EMI Records, it was an {{immediate}} commercial and critical success, debuting atop the United States Billboard 200—the first predominately Spanish-language album to do so. It sold 175,000 copies on its first day of release in the U.S.—a then-record for a female vocalist. With first week sales of 331,000 units, it became the second-highest first-week sales for a female musician since Nielsen Soundscan began monitoring album sales in 1991. Billboard magazine declared it a [...] "historic" [...] event, while Time said the recording elevated Selena's music to a wider audience. It won Album of the Year at the 1996 Tejano Music Awards and Female Pop Album of the Year at the 2nd annual Billboard Latin Music Awards.|$|E

500|$|Dreaming <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>is</b> a multigenre work of American pop and Latin music. It {{incorporates}} the diverse stylistic influences of techno, hip-hop, pop rock, dance-pop, regional Mexican music, Tejano, R, disco, and flamenco music. The {{first half of}} the album comprises R and pop ballads, while the remainder contains Latin-themed influences that profile Selena's music career. Music journalists said producers who worked with Selena tried to caricature her with Paula Abdul, Amy Grant, Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Madonna. Newsweek magazine called Selena's English-language recordings [...] "a blend of urban pop and Latin warmth". According to Allmusic's Stephen Erlewine, the album's mood is spicy, celebratory, and exuberant. [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] and [...] "Dreaming of You" [...] are lyrically identical; called [...] "confessional ballads", both recordings speak of despair, heartbreak, and fear of rejection from a man the songs' narrators are falling in love with. The lyrics of [...] "Dreaming of You" [...] also explore feelings of longing and hope. Larry Flick of Billboard magazine wrote that [...] "Dreaming of You"s idealistic lyrics have an [...] "affecting poignancy that will not be lost on AC [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 NHL season, the NHL and NHLPA honoured Näslund with a tribute and {{ceremonial}} puck drop prior to a game held in Stockholm, Sweden, between the San Jose Sharks and Columbus Blue Jackets. Several months later, the Canucks retired his number 19 jersey prior to a home game against the Tampa Bay Lightning on 11 December 2010. Attending the on-ice ceremony were his wife, three children, parents and sister, as well as former Canucks teammates, coaches and executives. The night included a video tribute highlighting his hockey career, speeches from team personalities and gift presentations from the organization. In honour of Näslund and his wife's past philanthropy in the Vancouver community, the team also announced the establishment of a sports equipment centre for underprivileged children. [...] Prior to the jersey raising, Näslund thanked those involved in his career. Reflecting on his career, he commented, [...] "Young hockey players from northern Sweden never dream of a night like this...To go from sitting up in the press box as a healthy scratch to be standing here in front <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> quite amazing." [...] By having his jersey retired, he became the third player in team history to receive the honour, after Stan Smyl and Trevor Linden.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} September 1995, and {{took place at}} the CTS Studios in London, with Madonna and co-actors Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. Engineer David Reitzas performed the mixing of the track at Larrabee North Studios, utilizing their Solid State Logic 9000 J series consoles for the mix. For the first day's sessions, music supervisor David Caddick suggested to record [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] with the 84 piece orchestra backing Madonna's vocals. However, Lloyd Webber was critical of [...] the recording arrangements done in the studio. The cast was also nervous. Flick noted that Banderas found the experience [...] "scary" [...] while Madonna was [...] "petrified" [...] when it came to recording the songs. [...] "I had to sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber... I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterwards. I thought I had done a terrible job", the singer recalled. Conductor John Mauceri remembered another challenge the production faced was adapting the stage numbers into a feature film; [...] "On film, it's different than being on stage because the person on the screen in front <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> never farther than someone on the pillow in bed next to you". Parker declared the first day of recording as [...] "Black Monday", since it was [...] "filled with trepidation and nerves... All of us came from very different worlds—from popular music, from movies, and from musical theater—and so we were very apprehensive".|$|E

500|$|Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Achy Obejas {{called the}} {{recording}} a fragmentary work {{and said it}} is [...] "Selena's past and about what might have been". Obejas called the record [...] "full of promise and flaws", and said its intentional bilingual nature was done by [...] "necessity rather than design". She also said the album is a Latino crossover nix, citing Gloria Estefan's earlier mainstream work as the primitive Latino crossover; although Selena [...] "didn't get {{to take the next}} step" [...] as did Estefan. Objeas also wrote that the album is the opposite of a [...] "masterpiece, or definitive, or even a testament to Selena's talents", but is more of a [...] "smorgasbord". Objeas praised Selena's [...] "complete ease on the R tunes" [...] and thought she was [...] "getting funky and pretty soulful". Enrique Lopetegui of The Los Angeles Times said Dreaming <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>is</b> Selena's [...] "most electric and satisfying album", and said it was an applicable [...] "epitaph" [...] for her. Lopetegui called the songs on the album [...] "radio-friendly pop tunes" [...] but said the album [...] "lacks cohesion" [...] and that he finds the bilingual album [...] "even more interesting than the original idea". According to Lopetegui, Selena [...] "blossoms into a full-fledged soul singer, with an aggressiveness seldom show before" [...] on her English-language tracks but finds the rancheras [...] "Tú Sólo Tú" [...] and [...] "El Toro Relajo" [...] the [...] "most impressive" [...] and saying Selena was inexperienced with that style. Christopher John Farley of Time magazine said Dreaming of You elevated Selena's music [...] "to a far wider audience than she ever had when she was alive". He said the album incorporates her [...] "finest, most enjoyable work" [...] and called it [...] "a commendable but sorrowful accomplishment". Contrasting her Tejano and English-language songs, Farley wrote that Selena's Tejano recordings was sometimes clumsy, whereas her English pop songs were [...] "sweet, pure and clear, and on the mariachi numbers, Selena shows off a voice that is sexy, strong and gracefully maturing".|$|E
500|$|Writing for the New York Daily News, Mary Talbot said {{listening}} to Dreaming of You was [...] "akin to sifting through a dead woman's scrapbook" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "disparate jottings and snapshots some artful, some light, all weighted with nostalgia". Talbot said the album showcases [...] "Selena's past and outlines {{what could have been}} her future", and because of the singer's death, the story is incomplete. She called the English offerings [...] "sturdy, generic pop numbers" [...] that would be favored among her Tejano following [...] "but there aren't enough of them to prove her strength or breadth as an English-language artist". Talbot said Selena was skillful in crisscrossing [...] "traditional Mexican music with a contemporary American pop sensibility, and that skill doesn't figure with these songs". Towards the end of her review, Talbot said Dreaming <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>is</b> [...] "the effervescent pop of her generation". Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News said the album [...] "doesn't deliver", writing that Selena was [...] "revamped to sound like one of pop radio's many generic female vocalist" [...] and that her English recordings lack [...] "the bubbly, effervescent personality, the chica-del-barrio charm" [...] found on her Tejano songs. Tarradell said the English songs were [...] "tepid imitations of Amy Grant and Abdul". Peter Watrous of The New York Times called Dreaming of You [...] "a collection of leftovers" [...] and said the Spanish-language songs [...] "sound better" [...] than Selena's English ones. Watrous said the producers did not ameliorate Selena's English-language tracks and gave their all. He further wrote that [...] "the music is faceless commerce" [...] but that Selena recorded them [...] "so well on the album" [...] that it suggested [...] "she had a good chance of success, working lush ballads in an anonymous pop style that Disney has mastered". Rock music contributor Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant described Dreaming of You as [...] "a package that hints at the overall talent and immense potential of the young star". Catlin said her English-language works were lacking [...] "technical heroics that have defined [...] in the '90s." [...] but states the singer [...] "is understandably assured" [...] on her Spanish offerings. He said Selena was [...] "low key" [...] and that the material seemed that way because she had only recorded four English-language tracks before her death.|$|E
