25|$|A {{portion of}} his Disputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricem was {{published}} in Bologna after his death. In this book Pico presents arguments against the practice of astrology that have had enormous resonance for centuries, up to <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>time.</b> Disputationes {{is influenced by the}} arguments against astrology espoused by one of his intellectual heroes, St. Augustine of Hippo, and also by the medieval philosophical tale Hayy Ibn-Yaqzan which promoted autodidacticism as a philosophical program. Pico's antagonism to astrology seems to derive mainly from the conflict of astrology with Christian notions of free will. But Pico's arguments moved beyond the objections of Ficino, who was himself an astrologer. The manuscript was edited for publication after Pico's death by his nephew Giovanni Francesco Pico della Mirandola, an ardent follower of Savonarola, and may possibly have been amended to be more forcefully critical. This might possibly explain the fact that Ficino championed the manuscript and enthusiastically endorsed it before its publication.|$|E

After twenty-nine meetings, Birkett drafted a report which he passed on to Parliament supporting the use of telephone taps and noting their effectiveness. On 9 December, a letter arrived from the Prime Minister offering him a peerage. He accepted, and his name appeared in the New Year Honours list, and was created Baron Birkett, of Ulverston in the County of Lancaster, and took his seat in the House of Lords on 20 February 1958. In the same year, he was awarded a LLD by the University of Cambridge, where the speaker said that Birkett was [...] "endowed with such a voice as Cicero declared to be first requisite of an orator" [...] and that [...] "in <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>time</b> {{there had been no}} one more skilled in swaying the mind of a jury." [...] In February 1959, he appeared on the first episode of the BBC television program Face to Face, where he was described as [...] "one of the three or four greatest criminal lawyers of this century, and perhaps one of the three or four greatest criminal lawyers of all time". Outside politics and the law, he also served as Master of the Worshipful Company of Curriers four times.|$|E

2500|$|There was a {{time when}} all {{knowledge}} was knowledge of God. <b>Our</b> <b>own</b> <b>time,</b> on the contrary, has the distinction of knowing about all and everything, about an infinite number of subjects, but nothing at all of God. Formerly the mind found its supreme interest in knowing God, and searching into His nature. It had and it found no rest unless in thus occupying itself with God. When it could not satisfy this need it felt unhappy. The spiritual conflicts to which the knowledge of God gives rise in the inner life were the highest which the spirit knew and experienced in itself, and all other interests and knowledge were lightly esteemed. <b>Our</b> <b>own</b> <b>time</b> has put this need, with all its toils and conflicts, to silence; we have done with all this, and got rid of it. What Tacitus said of the ancient Germans, that they were securi adversus deos, we have once more become in regard to knowledge, securi adversus deum. It no longer gives our age any concern that it knows nothing of God; on the contrary, it is regarded as a mark of the highest intelligence to hold that such knowledge is not even possible. What is laid down by the Christian religion as the supreme, absolute commandment, [...] "Ye shall know God," [...] is regarded as a piece of folly. Christ says, [...] "Be ye perfect, as My Father in heaven is perfect." [...] This lofty demand is to the wisdom of our time an empty sound. It has made of God an infinite phantom, which is far from us, and in like manner has made human knowledge a futile phantom of finiteness, or a mirror upon which fall only shadows, only phenomena. How, then, are we any longer to respect the commandment, and grasp its meaning, when it says to us, [...] " [...] Be ye perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect," [...] since we know nothing of the Perfect One, and since our knowing and willing are confined solely and entirely to appearance, and the truth is to be and to remain absolutely and exclusively a something beyond the present? And what, we must further ask, what else would it be worth while to comprehend, if God is incomprehensible? P. 35-36 ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 19, 2012, NPRs Drew Toal {{reviewed}} the book, reiterating Simon's astonishment {{at the impact}} that Dumas made in life and literature, and calling the book and life of Dumas [...] "fascinating". He compared the historical influence of Dumas with his offspring, stating he was [...] "larger-than-life" [...] and that [...] "the sword was mightier than the pen" [...] for this father of a famous novelist. While acknowledging the military impact that Dumas made in France, along with the inspiration his life provided as a backdrop in literature throughout history, Toal {{was surprised at the}} level of enthusiasm the author expressed about his subject. [...] "I like to think of him as history's ultimate underdog," [...] Reiss had explained in his earlier NPR interview.

[...] In the end, Toal summed up his review, stating, [...] "Despite Reiss' sometimes overblown regard, it's difficult to argue with him. That a former slave could rise on his merits so far, so fast some seven decades before Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation is a truly amazing story, one that needs no literary embellishment." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} the dramaturgy of the plays, Barton and Hall were both equally {{concerned}} they reflect, but not directly refer to, the contemporary political milieu. According to Trevor Nunn, when Hall founded the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1960, he [...] "insisted upon one simple rule: that whenever the Company did a play by Shakespeare, they should do it because the play was relevant, because the play made some demand upon our current attention." [...] This {{was very much in}} evidence during the production of The Wars of the Roses. Both Hall and Barton felt the civil chaos and breakdown of society depicted in the plays were mirrored by the contemporary political situation, in events such as the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963. Hall argued that [...] "we live among war, race riots, revolutions, assassinations, and the imminent threat of extinction. The theatre is, therefore, examining fundamentals in staging the Henry VI plays." [...] He also stated that during pre-production, [...] "I realised that the mechanism of power had not changed in centuries. We {{were in the middle of}} a blood-soaked century. I was convinced that a presentation of one of the bloodiest and most hypocritical periods in history would teach many lessons about the present." [...] Similarly, in her introduction to the Folio Society edition of the trilogy, Peggy Ashcroft challenged William Hazlitt's dismissal of the Henry VI plays as a depiction of England as a [...] "perfect beargarden", writing [...] "perhaps because we are more aware than ever before what a beargarden the whole world is, we see in these plays a microcosm of so many of the violent and tragic conflicts of <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>time.</b> The romantic view of Shakespeare, popular with the Victorians and lasting almost to the first half of this century has now changed, and we have become more aware of Shakespeare's political absorption and inspired interpretations of man's difficulty in governing himself and others." ...|$|E
