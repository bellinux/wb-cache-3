5000|$|The {{original}} German term, Rattenkönig, was calqued into English as rat king, {{and into}} French as roi des rats. The term was not <b>originally</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>reference</b> to actual rats, but for persons who lived off others. Konrad Gesner in Historia animalium (1551-58) stated: [...] "Some {{would have it}} that the rat waxes mighty in its old age and is fed by its young: {{this is called the}} rat king." [...] Martin Luther stated: [...] "finally, there is the Pope, the king of rats right at the top." [...] Later, the term referred to a king sitting on a throne of knotted tails.|$|E
5000|$|Silat Melayu (Jawi: سيلت ملايو), {{literally}} meaning [...] "Malay silat" [...] is {{a blanket}} term for silat {{styles of the}} Malay people.

In modern usage, the term is most often used to differentiate the Malaysian styles from Indonesian pencak silat. English-language writings sometimes mistakenly refer to silat Melayu as bersilat but {{this is actually a}} verb form of the noun silat, literally meaning [...] "to do silat".|$|E

5000|$|Penny dreadful is a pejorative {{term used}} to refer to cheap popular serial {{literature}} produced during the nineteenth century in the United Kingdom. The term is roughly interchangeable with penny horrible, penny awful, and penny blood. The term typically referred to a story published in weekly parts, each costing one penny. The subject matter of these stories was typically sensational, focusing on the exploits of detectives, criminals, or supernatural entities. While the term [...] "penny dreadful" [...] was <b>originally</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>reference</b> to a specific type of literature circulating in mid-Victorian Britain, it came to encompass a variety of publications that featured cheap sensational fiction, such as story papers and booklet [...] "libraries". The penny dreadfuls were printed on cheap wood pulp paper and were aimed at young working class males.|$|E
50|$|While {{the word}} silat {{is used by}} Malay-speakers {{throughout}} Southeast Asia, the art is officially called pencak silat in Indonesia. Primarily a Javanese term, it has been adopted worldwide in reference to professional competitive silat for sport, similar to the Chinese word wushu. Regional dialect names include penca (West Java), dika or padik (Thailand), silek (the Minangkabau pronunciation of silat), main-po or maen po (in the lower speech of Sundanese), and gayong or gayung (used in parts of Malaysia and Sumatra). The clear distinction between Indonesian and Peninsular silat is a relatively recent one based mainly on post-independence patriotic sentiments. The term silat Melayu ("Malay silat") was <b>originally</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>reference</b> to Riau but is today commonly used for referring to systems created on the Southeast Asian mainland. Generally speaking, silat Melayu {{is often associated with}} fixed hand positions, low stances, and slow dance-like movements. While this generalisation does not necessarily reflect the reality of silat techniques, it has had a notable influence on the stereotypical way the art is portrayed in Malaysia, Singapore, and to some extent Brunei.|$|E
