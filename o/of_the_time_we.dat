He owned a summer house in Marseilles, France, and another house in İskenderun, then in Syria and {{afterwards}} Turkey, and a number of houses in Palestine itself. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> lived in Jaffa. Our house had about twenty rooms, and we children would go down to swim in the sea.

In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby, while quite {{critical}} of the film overall, praised Douglas' work as [...] "the funniest, canniest performance of his career". Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and praised it for allowing [...] "all the financial wheeling and dealing to seem complicated and convincing, and yet always have it make sense. The movie can be followed by anybody, because the details of stock manipulation are all filtered through transparent layers of greed. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> know what's going on. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> know why". Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "This time he works up a salty sweat to end up nowhere, like a triathlete on a treadmill. But {{as long as he}} keeps his players in venal, perpetual motion, it is great scary fun to watch him work out". In his review for the Globe and Mail, Jay Scott praised the performances of the two leads: [...] "But Douglas's portrayal of Gordon Gekko is an oily triumph and as the kid Gekko thinks he has found in Fox ('Poor, smart and hungry; no feelings'), Charlie Sheen evolves persuasively from gung-ho capitalist child to wily adolescent corporate raider to morally appalled adult". Rita Kempley in the Washington Post wrote that the film [...] "is at its weakest when it preaches visually or verbally. Stone doesn't trust the time-honored story line, supplementing the obvious moral with plenty of soapboxery".|$|E

[...] Felicity Montagu, who plays Partridge's assistant Lynn, felt he was a good person [...] "deep down" [...] and actually [...] "vulnerable and lovable". Iannucci said that Partridge stays optimistic because he never sees himself as others see him, and that despite his failings was [...] "the perfect broadcaster for these times, when there are 24 hours to fill and dead time is a crime – he has a unique capacity to fill any vacuum with his own verbal vacuum." [...] Rob and Neil Gibbons felt that by the time of Mid Morning Matters, when Partridge is working for an even smaller radio station, he was more at peace with himself and that his lack of self-awareness saved him from misery.|$|E

It was {{produced}} by Eriksen and Hermansen using their stage name, Stargate, and Beyoncé. Eriksen told Sound on Sound, [...] "This song is very simple. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> have more chords in a song, because we find it hard writing a great song on just one chord. But {{if you do it}} right, you can make it work, and this song is an example." [...] The track had already been written in 2006. Eriksen and Hermansen played it to their manager, Tyran Smith, who said that it would be perfect for a duet between Shakira and Beyoncé. Eriksen and Hermansen considered this to be impossible, however Smith was devoted to that idea. As they had no lyric or top melody, various writers attempted to finish the song. The first three attempts were not satisfactory, and Smith put Eriksen and Hermansen to work together with Ghost and Dench, who wrote {{a significant part of the}} lyrics and the melody.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} shot in Roy Andersson's own studio in Östermalm, Stockholm. The filming of the scenes took three years to finish. [...] "It is not the {{shooting}} itself that takes time, but the work on creating the environments. We built almost all the sets in the studio, even those that took place outdoors. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> started from Roy's sketches," [...] said Johan Carlsson, production manager. There is one single scene that wasn't shot in studio, featuring a bus shelter in heavy rain. It had to be shot outdoors because of the huge amount of running water.

2500|$|In late December 1967, drummer Nick Mason {{approached}} Gilmour {{and asked}} him if he would be interested in joining Pink Floyd. He accepted and soon afterward became their fifth member; they initially intended to continue with Barrett as a non-performing songwriter. One of the group's business partners, Peter Jenner, commented: [...] "The idea was that Dave would... cover for Barrett's eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd was just going to write. Just to try to keep him involved". By March 1968, working with Barrett had become too difficult, so Pink Floyd met with business partners Jenner and Andrew King to discuss the situation. During the meeting, Barrett agreed to leave the band and the others committed to moving on without him. Waters later admitted: [...] "He was our friend, but most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> now wanted to strangle him". Jenner and King, who believed Barrett to be the creative genius of the band, decided to represent him and end their partnership with Pink Floyd.|$|E

According to family accounts, Julien was a {{difficult}} child. He was educated at the lycée Bonaparte and by the Dominicans at d'Arcueil. [...] He studied in the atelier of Ernst-Joseph-Angleton Girard (1813–1898), who was in turn a student or [...] "élève" [...] of d'Isabey. [...] Le Blant made his debut at the Paris Salon in 1874 with [...] "Assassinat de Lepellier Saint Fargeau". [...] From {{the beginning of his}} career he focused on military subjects and on scenes of the French Revolution. [...] This was in great contrast to the works of other military painters of the time who usually portrayed the glories of the subsequent Napoleonic Wars. [...] French painters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> obsessed with realism and so Le Blant collected uniforms, muskets and peasant's clothing to have his models [...] that posed for him wear. [...] His work was popular and he was sought after both as a painter and an illustrator. [...] While his large works were in oil, he also developed a reputation for his watercolors. [...] In addition to his scenes of military campaigns and armies, he also painted maritime subjects, but warships rather than scenes of commerce.|$|E
