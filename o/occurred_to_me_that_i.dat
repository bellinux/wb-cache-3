[...] I was tall, stocky, and they wanted me on the {{football}} team. Also, I was never ostracized as weird just because I was a film geek, because my parents would come to school and show 16mm films, or teach leatherworking and jewelry classes, which all the kids thought was cool[...] [...] [...] It never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was fat until the fifth grade, when a new kid at school started causing problems. [...] That's when Dad showed me José Ferrer as Cyrano de Bergerac; when someone hurls an insult at him, he says, 'Is that all? Ah, no, young sir, you're too simple. [...] You might have said a great many things. [...] Why waste your opportunity?' And then he names a score better than himself. Or Cocteau's La Belle et la Bête (Beauty and the Beast). [...] Or Charles Laughton in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. [...] You don't have to feel bad about yourself just because you're different (boiling oil notwithstanding)." ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{also should}} like to know. In another thirty hours I was to find out.|$|E
60|$|It {{was just}} getting dark. The idea <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might be {{followed}} again and attacked on the high-road.|$|E
60|$|It never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{he could}} change. I felt so secure in his love. It never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> anyone could take him from me.|$|R
60|$|It <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you may perhaps know, or know of, {{a kind of}} {{man that}} I want to discover.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Miss Stanbury, she {{has given}} me an answer. But it has <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> young ladies are sometimes,--perhaps a little--" ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was such}} a very {{provoking}} question (for it had never in the most distant manner <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me),</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> said, snappishly,-- ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was in the}} {{presence}} of the aristocratic theory currently working as distinguished from my as yet unformulated intentions.|$|E
60|$|I {{think it}} <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{had already begun}} it, in my poor way: but {{it occurs to me}} now, whether or no.|$|E
60|$|She relapsed into silence. It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> having posted her {{thoroughly}} in my affairs, I {{was entitled}} to ask about hers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope Mrs. Mannering {{does not}} object to my coming," [...] she said. [...] "It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> she was not {{particularly}} cordial." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Throgton," [...] he said, [...] "it has <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{there were}} points about that {{solution}} that we didn't get exactly straight somehow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had perhaps {{taken too}} much upon myself now and then. You are my chief, of course, and I don't {{want to look}} pushing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's just <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{can hardly}} be married in rags. I think I had better go up to town {{for a few days}} to get some things." ...|$|E
6000|$|I haven't time to work. Life is so {{much too}} short. A little while ago it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was nearly forty. [To MRS. CROWLEY.] D'you know the feeling? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Strange as it {{may seem}} to you, my worthy friend, it never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> my wife's health could be any {{business}} of yours.' ...|$|R
60|$|It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{perhaps she}} was afraid that she too would be taken captive and eaten, but I kept my {{reflection}} to myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was looking}} at the officer man, and {{scarcely}} noticed him. It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the attitude you complain of probably runs in the family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} you did," [...] the woman replied. [...] "I was in the Court when the verdict was brought in. It has since <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should like you to {{understand}} exactly what you have done, the responsibility you have incurred." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'By the way,' said Mr. Swancourt, {{after some}} conversation, 'you said your whole name was Stephen Fitzmaurice, {{and that your}} {{grandfather}} came originally from Caxbury. Since I have been speaking, it has <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know something of you. You belong to a well-known ancient county family--not ordinary Smiths in the least.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' {{said the}} Emperor, 'but {{there are so}} many who ask for a place that I don't know whether there will be one for you; but, still, I will think of you. Stay, it has just <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want someone to look after the swine, for I have so very many of them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] he replied, [...] "it merely <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Mrs. Hunter {{wished to}} drive on. I thought I'd better point {{it out to}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not aware, sir," [...] {{replied the}} wolf, [...] "that I require {{a pretext for}} loving chops; it never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> one was necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's less credible," [...] I said. And it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{the grey}} stretch of downland beyond {{must be the}} ridge {{to the west of}} Ridinghanger.|$|R
60|$|I did not answer, and {{he walked}} by my side silently. We {{continued}} thus for perhaps {{a quarter of a}} mile. I began to feel a little ridiculous. At last we passed a stationer's, and it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might as well buy some paper. It would be an excuse to be rid of him.|$|E
60|$|Ransome {{gave me one}} of his attractive, intelligent, quick glances {{and went}} away with the tray. It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been talking {{somewhat}} in Mr. Burns' manner. It annoyed me. Yet often in darker moments I forgot myself into an attitude toward our troubles more fit for a contest against a living enemy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{turned over}} our {{conversation}} in my mind, after you had gone," [...] replied Mr. Bruff. [...] "And it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might perhaps {{be of some}} use on this occasion. I was {{just in time to}} catch the train, and I had no opportunity of discovering the carriage in which you were travelling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "H-m-m!" [...] murmured Mr. Conant. [...] "It <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{a friend}} of Colonel Hathaway might desire a more luxurious home {{than that of the}} Widow Harrington." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} {{standing}} a little aside, seeing them both in profile. At <b>that</b> moment it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Razumov's face was older than his age.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew some}} {{one who was}} rather {{interested}} in astronomy. It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it would be rather odd if--my friend--chanced to be looking through come telescope." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are old friends," [...] I answered. [...] "I used to {{know him}} {{years ago when he}} kept a Mexican cigar store in Buffalo. It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{might be able to help}} the cause of {{peaceful}} intervention. I have already had a certain experience in Turkey. I am commissioned to make General Villa an offer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no {{rational}} person," [...] cried Meta. [...] "It {{was so nice}} {{to think}} of her being with the poor mother, and I was quite interested in managing for myself; besides, you know, it was just a proof how one learns to be selfish, that it had never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ought to spare her." ...|$|E
60|$|THE {{symposium}} of {{the preceding}} evening {{had been a little}} too much for my nerves. I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy. Instead of going out therefore to spend the evening as I had proposed, it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not do a wiser thing than just eat a mouthful of supper and go immediately to bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will speak}} to him. I am so {{accustomed}} to be my own mistress {{that it did not}} <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> we should have to ask him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very kind}} of you to say so," [...] replied the Woman of the World. [...] "It never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you would care for one." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wondered}} {{now that}} it had never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a man whose hair at fifty-five was already streaked with grey, must have passed through some terrible ordeal.|$|R
