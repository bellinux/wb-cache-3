Walsh argues that the macrostructural <b>opportunity</b> <b>model</b> helps explain why black murderers almost always choose black victims. There are disparities in rates of reporting rape where victims of some races are statistically less likely or more likely to report their rape, especially depending on the race of the offender. Black women in America are more likely to report sexual assault that has been perpetrated by a stranger. Black {{women are more likely to}} under-report rapes overall as they are more likely to blame themselves, feel they will be blamed or feel they won't be believed.|$|E

[...] (Heanue and Pyers 1966). The Fratar model was shown to have weakness in areas experiencing land use changes. As comparisons between the models showed that either could be calibrated equally well to match observed conditions, because of computational ease, gravity models became more widely spread than intervening opportunities models. Some theoretical problems with the intervening opportunities model were discussed by Whitaker and West (1968) concerning its inability to account for all trips generated in a zone which {{makes it more difficult}} to calibrate, although techniques for dealing with the limitations have been developed by Ruiter (1967).|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{development}} of a new gravity - <b>opportunity</b> <b>model</b> for trip distribution is presented. Wilson's formalism to obtain the gravity model, and Schneider's intervening- opportunities model are used as the basis for deducing the new model. The notational difficulties associated with the amalgamation of the gravity and opportunity models are circunvented via the definition of an intervening-opportunity matrix. The conventional gravity model is shown to be a particular case of the new gravity - <b>opportunity</b> <b>model.</b> The calibration of the new model is reached by using Furness's matrix calibration procedure together with Hooke and Jeeves's nonlinear optimizing method. Finally, a practical application of the model for estimating intermunicipal passenger flows by public transport, in Southern Brazil, is reported. ...|$|E

There are usually two approaches calculating accessibility: the gravity model and the accumulated <b>opportunity</b> <b>model.</b> The gravity model investigates the potential attraction between origin and destination on a TAZ level based on transportation networks [21, 22]. The accumulated <b>opportunity</b> <b>model</b> calculates the number of jobs that can be accessed within a fixed commuting time [23]. Job accessibility is not only a technical index to capture the urban form pattern and transit cost from home to the job location, but also measure the performance on job markets—especially for low-income, women, ethnic minorities and other vulnerable groups [15]. In terms of urban form, job accessibility also includes the consideration of the land-use and spatial distribution information. Currently, better accessibility is listed as the principles of good urban planning.|$|E

Correspondingly, a joint spatial-temporal access scheme (JSTAS) is proposed to realize successive spectrum access for continuous data transmission. The multihop CRNs with fixed relaying employ decode-and-forward with and without signal-to-noise ratio selection, which are named as SDF and DF, respectively. Then, considering the interference constraints from multiple primary receivers, the interference of one primary transmitter and the maximum transmit powers of cognitive users, we study the outage performance of multihop CRNs with JSTAS over Nakagami-m fading. To comprehensively evaluate JSTAS, we further present the pure spatial access scheme (SAS) and the pure temporal access scheme (TAS) under the spatial-temporal <b>opportunity</b> <b>model,</b> and calculate their average network outage probabilities. Simulation results demonstrate that SDF outperforms DF, while JSTAS outperforms SAS and TAS under all considered scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The urban {{development}} of green-field areas requires an assessment against economic, {{social and environmental}} sustainability objectives of which vehicle-kilometers of travel (VKT) and journey to work patterns by automobile is one important criterion. Current practice in Australia on travel demand forecasting applies strategic land-use and spatial interaction models calibrated {{for the whole of}} the metropolitan area to the proposed urban release area to estimate future VKT, among other travel indicators. This will give misleading results for spatial patterns of traffic in these release areas as demonstrated by previous research. A case study of Canberra, the Australia’s national capital, is being investigated to assess whether there is a case or not for a variation to the long-term metropolitan structure policy (linear development structure of the Y-Plan) using both the traditional gravity model and the intervening <b>opportunities</b> <b>model</b> with location-specific preference functions.

40|$|D. Phil. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to answer the following question: Can a feasible liberal model be developed and defended that promotes and integrates egalitarian and Anon-egalitarian @ and aggregative values, {{while at the same time}} respecting the individual as an autonomous agent, who, as such, may be held accountable for the consequences of his decisions and actions but not for those consequences that may be attributed to his circumstances? In order to answer the research question a systematic examination of the leading liberal conceptions of equality, with special attention to an alternative approach in terms of a substantive equality of <b>opportunity</b> <b>model,</b> is undertaken. The research falls into three distinguishable parts. In the first part the role of equality in Rawls=s theory of justice as fairness was critically analysed. The conclusion reached was that whereas Rawls=s theory provides valuable insights on which to base a liberal theory of equality his theory fails to provide specific guidelines on which to make the crucial distinction between autonomous choices and choices dictated by the person=s circumstances. In the second part the conceptions of equality found in the work of Nozick, Dworkin, Sen and Walzer were compared with that of Rawls and explored for its potential for grounding a liberal conception of equality based on equality of opportunity. Limited support for the compound equality of <b>opportunity</b> <b>model</b> is found in Nozick=s libertarian conception of equality as formal equality of opportunity. Conceptually Dworkin=s conception of equality as equality of resources was found to be a powerful model to distinguish between those circumstances over which the individual has no control and therefore should not be held accountable and those choices over which the individual exercises control and hence should be held accountable. Moving from the equality of resources approaches, as exemplified by Rawls and Dworkin, to the equality of opportunity approaches, Sen=s equality of capability is discussed. Of particular importance is Sen=s insight that equality of opportunity requires one to take into consideration the individual=s capacity to convert the means at his or her disposal into ends and henceforth that these differential conversion capacities should be equalized. The compound equality of <b>opportunity</b> <b>model</b> proposed in this thesis in important part rests on the assumption that equality is a complex value which derives its value from the context in which it is employed. As such Walzer=s idea of complex equality is valuable in that it recognizes the plurality and the contextuality of the ideal of equality. In the third part the compound equality of <b>opportunity</b> <b>model</b> is introduced by distinguishing between equality of results and equality of opportunity approaches. It is then argued that it is possible, even though imperfectly, to distinguish between circumstances and autonomous choice by means of statistical techniques whereby people may be grouped by identifying independent variables predicative of success in the different spheres of life. It is shown how this approach may enable us to hold people accountable for their autonomous actions and choices but not for their circumstances. It is further argued that efficiency and aggregative considerations may operate as moderating variables in the different spheres of life. It is also argued that this model will promote accountability at the individual as well as the institutional level and how substantive equality of opportunity should predominate at the early stages of life while formal equality of opportunity should prevail at the point where positions of some importance are distributed so that third party interests are protected. This thesis is concluded with the claim that conceptually the model is feasible and capable of implementation. If we take seriously the idea of individual autonomy and accountability, and the notion that equality of opportunity provides the means to isolate the consequences of individual effort and motivation from the consequences of (undeserved) circumstances, then something like the compound equality of <b>opportunity</b> <b>model</b> may provide the means to give expression to our convictions.

Therefore, this creates business <b>opportunity</b> <b>model</b> for the dealer.

By spatial sensing and temporal sensing, the cognitive sensors with JSTAS control the transmission powers by fully considering their maximum transmission powers, the interference constraints of multiple primary receivers and the interference from one primary transmitter. To evaluate JSTAS, we derive the closed-form outage probability under Rayleigh fading channels and make comparisons among five different schemes.

30|$|Both topological (Table  1) and {{temporal}} analyses (Fig.  4) of diversification rates suggest that Lithocarpus species were slowly accumulated and formed persistent lineages through time, supporting Thorne’s (1999) theory that East Asia {{serves as a}} living museum (refugium) to preserve archaic flora (cf. Favre et al. 2016). Such temporal increases in the synchronous diversification rate in subtropical and tropical lineages indicates that (1) the southward founder event did not accelerate the diversification rate and (2) the diversification rate shift of Asian stone oaks was spatially independent. Since the species composition and climate differ between the subtropics and tropics, the congruent patterns of diversification rates of stone oaks in these two areas suggest that the evolution of Lithocarpus may fit the stochastic model of ecological drift (Benedetti-Cecchi et al. 2008) rather than the ecological <b>opportunity</b> <b>model</b> (Yoder et al. 2010). The ecological opportunity theory posits an increased rate of morphological or species diversification due {{to a reduction in}} interspecific competitive pressures (i.e., ecological release) when novel habitats were colonized. In contrast, under the stochastic model, species assemblages in an environment are the consequence of random variation in the fundamental biological processes of birth, death, and migration (Bell 2000), in which environmental heterogeneity is not responsible for species diversity (Maurer and McGill 2004). One of the characteristics of the ecological opportunity theory is adaptive radiation (Losos and Mahler 2010; Yoder et al. 2010). Species that meet the ecological <b>opportunity</b> <b>model</b> have shorter life histories and are more sensitive to environmental changes—e.g., birds (Norman and Christidis 2016; Schweizer et al. 2014), fishes (Arbour and Lopez-Fernandez 2016; Silva et al. 2016), ferns (Sundue et al. 2015), and Gentianaceae (von Hagen and Kadereit 2003). Stone oaks with longer life histories could not instantaneously respond to environmental variations spatially, but in the long process of time, diversity could accumulate from different archaic sources (refugia). Such a “living museum” model of the diversification patterns of genus Lithocarpus could be explained by the hypothesis of multiple origins with in situ diversification of insular species.|$|E
30|$|There {{are several}} other reasons why {{migrants}} prefer entrepreneurship: {{to be independent}} or to be their own boss; earn extra income; gain some work experience; maintain family tradition; dissatisfaction with the previous job; need for flexibility; desire {{to make a career}} of to have a job in business; ideological reasons, or leadership qualities (Baycan-Levent et al. 2003 Metcalf et al. 1996;Clark and Drinkwater 1998).
