5|$|All {{actions have}} the above four factor present in them. When {{different}} permutations of the sub-elements {{of the four}} factors are calculated, the Jain teachers speak of 108 {{ways in which the}} karmic matter can be attracted to the soul. Even giving silent assent or endorsement to acts of violence from far away has karmic consequences for the soul. Hence, the scriptures advise carefulness in actions, awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> purity in thoughts as means to avoid the burden of karma.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{new game}} is set within a {{well-established}} franchise, Starbreeze tried {{to retain the}} essence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> rebuild these elements. The game's story was written by British science-fiction writer Richard K Morgan, whom the team approached after they read his book Altered Carbon. Syndicate was Morgan's second video-game script after 2011's Crysis 2; he used the original game for reference and included elements that those who had played it would immediately recognize. He preserved the original's dystopian setting and theme, and hoped to use these elements to build a powerful story. Morgan traveled to Sweden to meet Starbreeze's game designers to ensure the game's story would not contradict its overall design.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{have been}} kept in hives {{since at least the}} First Dynasty of Egypt, five {{thousand}} years ago, and man had been harvesting honey from the wild long before that. Fixed comb hives are used in many parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> are made from any locally available material. In more advanced economies, where modern strains of domestic bee have been selected for docility and productiveness, various designs of hive are used which enable the combs to be removed for processing and extraction of honey. Quite apart from the honey and wax they produce, honey bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, and in many places hives are transported around the countryside to assist in pollination.|$|E

5|$|Following {{months of}} rumours, in October 2013 a BBC press conference {{announced}} {{the return of}} 11 episodes (two of which previously existing) from a television relay station {{in the city of}} Jos, Nigeria. In the course of his work abroad, Philip Morris of Television International Enterprises Archives had discovered episodes 1-6 of The Enemy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>and</b> episodes 1-6 of The Web of Fear. and returned 11 of these to the BBC. The return of the nine missing episodes was the single largest recovery of Doctor Who episodes in 25 years, resulting in only the second full serial from Troughton's first two seasons to be restored to the BBC.|$|E

5|$|From the start, {{the film}} moves {{continuously}} between Barton's subjective view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> {{one which is}} objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera pans down to Barton, watching {{the end of his}} play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.|$|E

5|$|Greek mythology is {{explicitly}} embodied {{in a large}} collection of narratives, and implicitly in Greek representational arts, such as ancient vase-paintings and votive gifts. Greek myth attempts to explain the origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> details the lives and adventures {{of a wide variety}} of gods, goddesses, heroes, heroines and mythological creatures. These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition; today the Greek myths are known primarily from ancient Greek literature.|$|E

5|$|Greek mythology is {{the body}} of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, {{concerning}} their gods and heroes, the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It {{was a part of}} the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.|$|E
5|$|In {{different}} eras, various gods {{were said}} to hold the highest position in divine society, including the solar deity Ra, the mysterious god Amun, and the mother goddess Isis. The highest deity was usually credited with the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> often connected with the life-giving power of the sun. Some scholars have argued, {{based in part on}} Egyptian writings, that the Egyptians came to recognize a single divine power that lay behind all things and was present in all the other deities. Yet they never abandoned their original polytheistic view of the world, except possibly during the era of Atenism in the 14th century BC, when official religion focused exclusively on the impersonal sun god Aten.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1970, {{the diamond}} was rated {{one of the}} thirty great stones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> placed on display at Parke-Bernet Galleries in New York City. On 16 April 1970, the diamond was sold at auction for $500,000 (allowing for inflation, this would now be $) to Edward J. Hand, a then 48-year-old {{trucking}} firm executive from Greenwich, Connecticut. This was the second highest auction price ever for a diamond at that time, the first being circa $1.1 million for the Taylor-Burton Diamond several years earlier. Six years later, the diamond was placed on display in November 1976 at a charity benefit {{as a means to}} attract donors to that benefit.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of a world {{financial}} crisis, the King encouraged the formation of a National Government in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin, and volunteered to reduce the civil list to help balance the budget. He was concerned by the rise to power in Germany of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. In 1934, the King bluntly told the German ambassador Leopold von Hoesch that Germany was now the peril <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> that there was bound to be a war within ten years if she went on at the present rate; he warned the British ambassador in Berlin Eric Phipps to be suspicious of the Nazis.|$|E
5|$|Leisure is a {{major part}} of the London economy, with a 2003 report {{attributing}} a quarter of the entire UK leisure economy to London.

5|$|Other {{relationships}} {{include the}} algorithmic analysis of artworks by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, {{the finding that}} traditional batiks from different regions of Java have distinct fractal dimensions, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially Filippo Brunelleschi's theory of perspective, which eventually led to Girard Desargues's projective geometry. A persistent view, based ultimately on the Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> that therefore the world's geometry is sacred, as seen in artworks such as William Blake's The Ancient of Days.|$|E
