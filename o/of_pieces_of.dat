5|$|Despite its short life, {{the first}} Disraeli {{government}} succeeded in passing a number <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> legislation of a politically noncontentious sort. It ended public executions, and the Corrupt Practices Act {{did much to}} end electoral bribery. It authorised {{an early version of}} nationalisation, having the Post Office buy up the telegraph companies. Amendments to the school law, the Scottish legal system, and the railway laws were passed. Disraeli sent the successful expedition against Tewodros II of Ethiopia under Sir Robert Napier.|$|E
5|$|From the 5th to the mid-9th centuries {{the art of}} the Picts is {{primarily}} known through stone sculpture, and a smaller number <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> metalwork, often of very high quality. After the conversion of the Picts and the cultural assimilation of Pictish culture into that of the Scots and Angles, elements of Pictish art became incorporated into the style known as Insular art, which was common over Britain and Ireland and became highly influential in continental Europe and contributed to the development of Romanesque styles.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the house}} passed to the National Trust in 1972, major works of {{restoration}} and re-creation have been undertaken and a number <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> Burges furniture, mostly not original to the house, are displayed. These include a bookcase from Buckingham Street and a chimney piece from the Hall at Worcester College, Oxford, where, in the 1960s, some decorative works by Burges were removed, although his redecoration of the college Chapel remains. The aim is, as far as possible, to reinstate the work of Burges and Crace.|$|E

Mozart's 40th Symphony in G minor (1st movement) is performed by the orchestra at the Conservatoire in Bratislava when Koskov flees. As Moneypenny tells Bond, Kara is next to perform Alexander Borodin's String Quartet in D major, and the finale to Act II of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro (in Vienna) also features. Before Bond is drugged by Kara, she is practising the Cello solo from the first movement of Dvořák's cello concerto in B minor. At {{the end of the}} film, Kara and an orchestra (conducted onscreen by John Barry) perform Tchaikovsky's Rococo Variations to rapturous applause.|$|E
5|$|In 1865–1867 Captain Thomas Chaloner and William Downing Bruce {{carried out}} the first major {{excavation}} by cutting a trench across the site. A number of features were discovered, including a stone coffin containing the skeleton of a tall man thought to be Robert de Brus, {{the remnants of a}} monumental shrine and painted roof bosses. Evidence of the 1289 fire was discovered in the form <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> fused metal – an amalgam of lead, silver and iron that had melted and penetrated the floor {{in the heat of the}} fire. The Office of Works carried out excavations in 1932 in conjunction with work to consolidate the walls and grounds so they could be opened to the public. Further work was carried out by Roy Gilyard Beer between 1947–54 for the Ministry of Works, which exposed more of the site and cleared material from the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In his 1988 book Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, the {{freelance}} dinosaurologist Gregory Paul {{proposed that}} A. fragilis had tall pointed horns and a slender build {{compared to a}} postulated second species A. atrox, and was not a different gender due to rarity. Allosaurus atrox was originally named by Marsh in 1878 as the type species of its own genus, Creosaurus, {{and is based on}} YPM 1890, an assortment of bones including a couple <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> the skull, portions of nine tail vertebrae, two hip vertebrae, an illium, and ankle and foot bones. Although the idea of two common Morrison allosaur species was followed in some semi-technical and popular works, the 2000 thesis on Allosauridae noted that Charles Gilmore mistakenly reconstructed USNM 4734 as having a shorter skull than the specimens referred by Paul to atrox, refuting supposed differences between USNM 4734 and putative A. atrox specimens like DINO 2560, AMNH 600, and AMNH 666.|$|E

5|$|Raynor is {{only ever}} {{depicted}} by his unit portrait {{through the course}} of StarCraft and Brood War. He is later shown in StarCraft II as a physically strong yet casually dressed character, wearing his combat gear over his normal clothes, which are further described in the novels as well-worn and rough in appearance. Raynor has a neatly trimmed moustache and beard, which by the time of StarCraft II are beginning to grey. His StarCraft II model also reveals the presence of tattoos on both his arms. In addition, a number <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> concept art depict Raynor smoking. Unlike other characters, Raynor isn't seen wearing a uniform at any point during the series, with the rare exceptions of when he is encased in marine combat armour. Raynor is often depicted riding a modified vulture hovercycle, which he uses for transport and in open land combat.|$|E
5|$|The Garden Lobby of Althorp also {{contains}} a number <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> porcelain from reputable European manufacturers, but also several rare Oriental pieces. Of note in the Garden Lobby aside from its many plates is a Sèvres tobacco jar with double strap handles, believed to be painted by Louis Jean Thévenet in 1765, two Chelsea vases decorated with putti which metaphorically represent the four seasons, which the Red Earl had bought {{as a gift for}} his wife Charlotte, an extremely finely carved Meissen flower bowl with hundreds of tiny gilded blooms which dates to around 1745, a Meissen card box, and a blue and gold cherubic Meissen chocolate set-for-one which was believed to have been made for Marie Antoinette in 1781 as a present celebrating the birth of her son Dauphin.|$|E
5|$|The Mari Lwyd itself {{consists}} of a horse's skull that is decorated with ribbons and affixed to a pole; {{to the back of}} the skull is attached a white sheet, which drapes down to conceal both the pole and the individual carrying this device. On occasion, the horse's head was represented not by a skull but was instead made from wood or even paper. In some instances, the horse's jaw was able to open and close as a result of string or lever attached to it, and there are accounts <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> glass being affixed into the eye sockets of some examples, representing eyes. An observer of the tradition as it was performed at Llangynwyd during the nineteenth century noted that preparation for the activity was a communal event, with many locals involving themselves in the decorating of the Mari Lwyd.|$|E

5|$|The highway through Imperial Valley was {{originally}} a plank road made <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> wood that were tied together. The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915. Following this, US80 was built {{through the valley}} as the main east–west route. Plans for a new freeway across the southernmost reaches of California date from before 1950. The bridge over the Colorado River was replaced in 1956, {{at a cost of}} $1.2 million, and was in use until 1978, when the I-8 bridge was built. In 1957, the City of El Centro expressed a desire for the new freeway to replace US80 to be routed along the southern limits of the city. Caltrans engineer Jacob Dekema stated {{at the time that the}} four-lane freeway would not be constructed on the US80 routing due to possible expansion of the Naval Air Facility El Centro.|$|E
5|$|DNA usually {{occurs as}} linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} makes up its genome; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes. The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> DNA called genes. Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then {{used to make a}} matching protein sequence in a process called translation, which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here {{the focus is on the}} interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.|$|E
5|$|Route 12 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1909 from San Diego to El Centro, and Route 27 was added from El Centro to Yuma in 1915. Before a highway was {{constructed}} through the Imperial San Dunes, travelers had to pass to the north in order to reach Yuma. The first route through Imperial Valley was originally a plank road made <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> wood that were tied together. The road was completed by October 1912, and portions were still visible into the 2010s. The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915, and a new plank road was opened that year which became state-maintained in 1917, and used a foundation of wooden rails, with the planks bound together by steel, as opposed to simple planks that were fastened to rails. However, traffic congestion and dusty conditions made travel along the plank road difficult. The delay in constructing a road to San Diego caused increased development in Los Angeles and resulted in that city becoming the trade and population center of Southern California.|$|E
