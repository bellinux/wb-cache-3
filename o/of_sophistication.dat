5|$|Although civilizations in Central America {{attained}} {{a relatively high}} level <b>of</b> <b>sophistication</b> by the eleventh century AD, they lagged behind other civilizations {{in the development of}} musical instruments. For example, they had no stringed instruments; all of their instruments were idiophones, drums, and wind instruments such as flutes and trumpets. Of these, only the flute was capable of producing a melody. In contrast, pre-Columbian South American civilizations in areas such as modern-day Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically. South American cultures of the time used pan-pipes as well as varieties of flutes, idiophones, drums, and shell or wood trumpets.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{took the}} new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the Irish {{composer}} John Field, {{to a deeper}} level <b>of</b> <b>sophistication.</b> He {{was the first to}} write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op.28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert étude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op.10 published in 1833, Op.25 in 1837).|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the birth}} of ASL, sign {{language}} had been used by various communities in the United States. In the United States, as elsewhere in the world, hearing families with deaf children have historically employed ad-hoc home sign, which often reaches much higher levels <b>of</b> <b>sophistication</b> than gestures used by hearing people in spoken conversation. As early as 1541 at first contact by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, there were reports that the Plains Indians had developed a sign language to communicate between tribes of different languages.|$|E

The only co-worker he invites {{to the funeral}} is Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), who flees when Dwight begins shooting the corpse with a shotgun to ensure it is really dead. At the funeral, Dwight's family gathers: his cousins Mose (Michael Schur) and Zeke (Matt Jones), his brother Jeb (Thomas Middleditch), his sister Fannie (Majandra Delfino), his nephew Cammy (Blake Garrett Rosenthal), and his uncle Heinrich (Tom Bower). The family learns that Aunt Shirley has willed the siblings her estate {{on the condition that}} they all come back home to run it. Despite Dwight's enthusiasm in inheriting it, Fannie and Jeb are unwilling to move back in due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>sophistication</b> farm life offers. Nevertheless, Dwight convinces them to help him run the farm.|$|E
5|$|However, wall {{construction}} continued {{regardless of}} court politics during this time. The Ordos walls underwent extension, elaboration, and repair {{well into the}} 16th century. Brick and stone started to replace tamped earth as the wall building material, because they offered better protection and durability. This change in material {{gave rise to a}} number of necessary accommodations with regard to logistics, and inevitably a drastic increase in costs. Instead of being able to draw on local resources, building projects now required brick-kilns, quarries, and transportation routes to deliver bricks to the work site. Also, masons had to be hired since the local peasantry proved inadequate for the level <b>of</b> <b>sophistication</b> that brick constructions required. Work that originally could be done by one man in a month with earth now required 100 men to do in stone.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Persians adopted war engines from the Romans. The Romans had {{achieved}} and maintained {{a high degree}} <b>of</b> <b>sophistication</b> in siege warfare and had developed a range of siege machines. On the other hand, the Parthians were inept at besieging; their cavalry armies were more suited to the hit-and-run tactics that destroyed Antony's siege train in 36BC. The situation changed {{with the rise of}} the Sasanians, when Rome encountered an enemy equally skilled in siegecraft, who made use of artillery, machines captured from the Romans, embankments, siege towers, and in one instance, even an early form of gas warfare inside tunnels. Recent assessments comparing the Sasanians and Parthians have reaffirmed the superiority of Sasanian siegecraft, military engineering, and organization, as well as ability to build defensive works.|$|E

Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) greet Starbase Commander Quinteros (Gene Dynarski) and {{two pairs of}} small humanoid aliens known as Bynars; the Bynars heavily rely on their computer technology and work in pairs for best efficiency. Much of the crew take shore leave while Picard, Riker and a skeleton crew remain aboard. Riker is intrigued by the Bynars' claimed upgrades to the holodeck and starts a program in a jazz bar. The program includes a woman named Minuet (Carolyn McCormick), by whom Riker is fascinated, both as a beautiful and charming woman, {{but also by the}} level <b>of</b> <b>sophistication</b> in her responses. Riker shortly returns, and Picard walks in on him kissing Minuet, and he too is amazed by the simulation.|$|E
5|$|The Heterodontosauridae family persisted {{from the}} Late Triassic until the Early Cretaceous period, and existed {{for at least}} a 100 million years. Heterodontosaurids are known from Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas, but the {{majority}} have been found in southern Africa. Heterodontosaurids appear to have split into two main lineages by the Early Jurassic; one with low-crowned teeth, and one with high-crowned teeth (including Heterodontosaurus). The members of these groups are divided biogeographically, with the low-crowned group having been discovered in areas that were once part of Laurasia (northern landmass), and the high-crowned group from areas that were part of Gondwana (southern landmass). In 2012, Sereno labelled members of the latter grouping a distinct subfamily, Heterodontosaurinae. Heterodontosaurus appears to be the most derived heterodontosaurine, due to details in its teeth, such as very thin enamel, arranged in an asymmetrical pattern. The unique tooth and jaw features of heterodontosaurines appear to be specialisations for effectively processing plant material, and their level <b>of</b> <b>sophistication</b> is comparable to that of later ornithischians.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{during the}} Song period reached new heights <b>of</b> <b>sophistication.</b> Authors such as Yu Hao and Shen Kuo wrote books {{outlining}} {{the field of}} architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and structural engineering in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as slanting struts built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing. Shen Kuo also preserved Yu's specified dimensions and units of measurement for various building types. The architect Li Jie (1065–1110), who published the Yingzao Fashi ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') in 1103, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire. He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork, glazed tile making, and provided proportions for mortar formulas in masonry. In his book, Li provided detailed and vivid illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings. These illustrations displayed various applications of corbel brackets, cantilever arms, mortise and tenon work of tie beams and cross beams, and diagrams showing the various building types of halls in graded sizes. He also outlined the standard units of measurement and standard dimensional measurements of all building components described and illustrated in his book.|$|E
