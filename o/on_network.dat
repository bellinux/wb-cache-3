40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a portion of a distributed linear algebra library for use <b>on</b> <b>networks</b> of workstations. The library was designed with special consideration towards three characteristics of networks of workstations: small numbers of processes, availability of multithreading, and high communication latency. Two aspects of the library are highlighted. First, modifications to message passing primitives to permit their use in a multithreaded environment. Second, modifications to basic linear algebra algorithms to improve their performance <b>on</b> <b>networks</b> of workstations. A model of distributed linear algebra <b>on</b> <b>networks</b> of workstations is developed, and used to predict the performance of the modified algorithms. These predictions are compared to experimental results <b>on</b> several <b>networks</b> of workstations...|$|R

5|$|When {{the show}} began in 1985, {{the first season}} was {{broadcast}} on the Seven Network, at 5:30pm in Sydney, at 6:00pm in Melbourne and Adelaide and at 7:00pm in Brisbane.

In 1992 the show moved to 6:30pm to avoid direct competition from rival soap opera Home and Away on the Seven Network. Repeat episodes of Neighbours episodes from the 1988–1991 period were broadcast between 2000 and June 2003 <b>on</b> <b>Network</b> Ten. These episodes were seen at 3:30pm, before moving to 11:30am.

5|$|A {{music video}} was issued in November 2003 {{to promote the}} single. The video shows Sebastian on a TV set as it is being {{prepared}} for a show.

Various personnel walk around him and adjust the set. Sebastian stands and the image of the female is seen again, she wears white feathers. Later, Sebastian is dressed more formally in a white suit as he performs the song. On this set are plasma screens depicting the same young woman. The video ends with Sebastian in his casual gear again, sitting on the boxes. The video was produced by Australian Idols Stephen Tate and directed by the show's musical director, John Foreman.
