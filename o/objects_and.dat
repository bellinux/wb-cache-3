40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{internal}} representations of manipulations of objects with asymmet-ric mass distributions that are generated within a specific orientation are not generalizable to novel orientations, i. e., subjects fail to prevent object roll on their first grasp-lift attempt of the object following 180 ° object rotation. This suggests that representations of these manip-ulations are specific to the reference frame {{in which they are}} formed. However, it is unknown whether that reference frame is specific to the hand, the body, or both, because rotating the object 180 ° modifies the relation between <b>object</b> <b>and</b> body as well as <b>object</b> <b>and</b> hand. An alternative, untested explanation for the above failure to generalize learned manipulations is that any rotation will disrupt grasp performance, regardless if the reference frame in which the manipulation was learned is maintained or modified. We examined the effect of rotations that (1) maintain and (2) modify relations between <b>object</b> <b>and</b> body, <b>and</b> <b>object</b> <b>and</b> hand, on the generalizability of learned two-digit manipulation of an object with an asymmetric mass distribution. Following rotations that maintained the relation between <b>object</b> <b>and</b> body <b>and</b> <b>object</b> <b>and</b> hand (e. g., rotating the <b>object</b> <b>and</b> subject 180 °), subject...|$|R

In this research, the robots need to measure the transported <b>object</b> <b>and</b> the handcarts.

5|$|As a point-and-click {{adventure}} game, {{the player}} controls Simon using the mouse. The iOS and Android versions feature touch-screen controls. Gameplay involves moving Simon around and interacting with <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> other characters. The player can make Simon perform actions such as giving an item to another character, talk to another character, {{and pick up}} (add to inventory), examine, use, move, consume, wear, or open or close an item. Some actions are binary: they involve two <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> the player sometimes, after telling Simon to use an item, needs to specify what to use it with. A map that enables Simon to instantly transport to a major landmark (if it has been discovered) is provided. The postcard is used to load, save, or quit the game.|$|E

One example of a puzzle is the Frankenstein's monster which must be created by combining body parts in a specific location on the horror film set.

5|$|Domain-general views {{have been}} criticized for not fully {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole <b>objects,</b> <b>and</b> this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E
