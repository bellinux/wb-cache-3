A keyboard <b>optical</b> <b>display</b> <b>system</b> will be added by late 1970. Major input operations requiring the creation of “hard copy” will continue via the MTST system. Updating, editing and retrieval operations as well as input without hard copy production will be done through the “on-line” keyboard <b>optical</b> <b>display</b> <b>system.</b> Once the library's first data bank, the book catalog, has been established the computer may be consulted directly for library holdings from any optical display terminal throughout the medical center. Three basic information retrieval operations may be carried out through “on-line” optical display terminals. Output options include the reproduction of part or all of a given document, or the generation of statistical data, which are derived from two Acquisition Code lines. The creation of a central bibliographic record of Bowman Gray Faculty publications patterned after the cataloging program is presently under way. The cataloging and computer storage of serial holdings records will begin after completion of the reclassification project.

40|$|A {{group of}} organic chromophoric {{molecules}} including siloles, pyrans, tetraphenylethylenes and fulvenes, are designed and synthesized. Light emissions of conventional luminescent materials are often quenched by aggregate formation. These molecules, however, become stronger luminophors when aggregated {{although they are}} practically nonemissive in their dilute solutions. By varying their packing structures in the aggregation states, emission color ranging from blue to red can be achieved. The emission of fulvenes can also be controlled by changing their morphology. While they emit a faint light in the amorphous state, their crystal forms are strongly luminescent. Intermolecular interaction or restriction of intramolecular rotation in different states {{may be responsible for}} such behaviors. Thanks to such effects, the molecules can be employed as sensors for the detection of explosives, organic solvent vapors, solution pH, and biomacromolecules.

40|$|Subject of inquiry: induced {{emission}} {{appearing in}} resonant optical pumping of dust-type luminophores being activated by neodimum. The {{aim of the}} work is the obtaining of spectral-kinetic and threshold characteristics of induced emission in scattering media, the analysis of mechanisms of its initiation and probabilities of practical use. It was shown {{for the first time that}} emission initiation in dust-type luminophores activated by neodimum has been determined by scattering active medium. Excitation of dust containing more large and perfect microcrystals is determined by self-excitation of microcrystalline grains and by amplification in scattering active medium. A possibility for the creation of quasi-monochromatic bright radiation sources using finely dispersed luminophores activated by neodimium has been illustrated for the first time. Threshold effects are indicative of powder laser excitation.

Thus the sign of optical rotation of the polymers can be controlled by different combination of monomer and catalyst. Magnitude of the optical rotation can be "tuned'' by changing polymerization temperature with high temperature generally favoring random propagation. All the polymers have low polydispersity indexes (M-w/M-n, down to 1. 02) or possess narrow molecular weight distributions, Spectroscopic characterization confirms the molecular structure of polymers to be poly(silylethylene), that is, a polyethylene main chain with a bulky methyl- 1 -naphthylphenylsilyl side chain.

40|$|Most head-mounted {{displays}} (HMDs) {{suffer from}} substantial optical distortion, and vendor-supplied specifications for field-of-view often are {{at variance with}} reality. Such displays do not present perspective-related visual cues in a geometrically correct manner, which {{has the potential to}} affect applications of HMDs which depend on precise spatial perception. This paper provides empirical evidence for the degree to which these resulting distortions affect one type of spatial judgment in virtual environments. We show that minification in the HMD that would occur from an overstated HMD field of view results in a significant change in distance judgments. Incorrectly calibrated pitch and pincushion distortion, however, did not cause statistically significant changes in distance judgments for the degree of distortions examined. While the means for determining the <b>optical</b> distortion of <b>display</b> <b>systems</b> are well known, they are often not used in non-see-through HMDs due to problems in measuring and correcting for distortion.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a concept of}} mid-air tangible interaction and a system called ZeroN that was developed to enable this interaction. Through this research, I extend the tabletop tangible interaction modalities which have been confined to 2 D surfaces into 3 D space above the surface. Users are invited to place and move a levitated object in the mid-air space, which is analogous to placing objects on 2 D surfaces. For example, users can place a physical object that represents the sun above physical objects to cast digital shadows, or place a planet that will start revolving based on simulated physical conditions. To achieve these interaction scenarios, we developed ZeroN, a new tangible interface element that can be levitated and moved freely by computer in a three dimensional space. In doing so, ZeroN serves as a tangible representation of a 3 D coordinate of the virtual world through which users can see, feel, and control computation. Our technological development includes a magnetic and mechanical control system that can levitate and actuate a permanent magnet in 3 D space.

Each <b>display</b> <b>system</b> was evaluated in terms of its impact on overall TOC performance as assessed via objective traffic measures, and on operator workload, situation awareness (SA), team coordination within the TOC, and satisfaction with the <b>display</b> <b>system</b> as assessed via subjective operator survey responses. For each <b>display</b> <b>system,</b> data were collected for two weeks during weekday commute periods (defined as 6 : 30 am- 9 : 30 am and 3 : 30 pm- 6 : 30 pm). ^ Two-by-two multivariate analyses of variance were used to test the effects of <b>display</b> <b>system</b> and time of day on objective TOC performance measures and subjective operator ratings. No differences in TOC performance were found based on <b>display</b> <b>system</b> or time of day. Operator ratings of overall workload were higher with the automated <b>display</b> <b>system</b> and during the evening commute. A <b>display</b> <b>system</b> by time of day interaction was also found. Significant differences were also found in operator ratings of the individual workload components.
