40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} methodology to functionalize magnetic nanoparticles through surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The magnetite nanoparticles are prepared {{according to the}} method proposed by Sun et al. (2004), {{which leads to a}} monodisperse population of ~ 6 nm particles stabilized by oleic acid. The functionalization of the nanoparticles has been performed by transforming particles into macro-initiators for the ATRP, and to achieve this two different routes have been explored. The first one is the ligand-exchange method, which consists of replacing some oleic acid molecules adsorbed on the particle surface with molecules that act as an initiator for ATRP. The second method consists in using the addition reaction of bromine to the oleic acid double bond, which turns the oleic acid itself into an initiator for the ATRP. We have then grown polymer brushes of a variety <b>of</b> <b>acrylic</b> <b>polymers</b> on the particles, including polyisopropylacrylamide and polyacrylic acid.

40|$|Today, {{the first}} {{stages of the}} {{finishing}} processes of buffed cattle hides or full loose grain – known as impregnation – are largely carried out with acrylic resins and penetrating agents (typically, a mixture of surfactants and solvents). This application aims to strengthen the partially buffed grain layer bound {{to the rest of}} the dermis. To that end, a composition of emulsified acrylic resins is used, as well as a penetrating agent – usually isopropyl alcohol – and water. The process examined consists in the application <b>of</b> <b>acrylic</b> <b>polymers</b> in an aqueous emulsion that, because of their structure, size, and properties no longer require the use of the isopropyl alcohol contained in the penetrating agents. The use of this alcohol causes adverse effects on the health of workers that are exposed to emanations of isopropanol vapors (irritant to eyes, respiratory tract, and skin) in the work environment. Effects from prolonged exposition and inhalation may lead to headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea and, ultimately, to unconsciousness. By using the new polymers developed in this work, the negative environmental effects of the finishing process can be minimized. At the same time, the use of these highly carboxylate resins avoid the exposure to isopropyl alcohol, which is harmful to the health.

40|$|Polyurethane-type {{compositions}} were devel-oped as adhesive liners for poly(methyl methacrylate) restorations. Several poly-glycol-diisocyanate mixtures had excellent adhesion {{to human}} dentin {{when applied to}} moist teeth in vitro. Conventional acrylic restorations became durably bonded when applied on top of these urethane liners within 15 to 30 minutes. The need for an adhesive dental restoration material for use in anterior teeth is widely recognized. An adhesive polymeric resin restoration could eliminate marginal leakage, currently the most serious limitation of resin restorations. It {{has been shown that}} cold-curing acrylics, the most widely used poly-meric restorations, have poor marginal adaptation, 1 - 3 which fosters recurrent caries in many patients. The poor marginal seal is aggravated by shrinkage during polymeriza-tion, which can be only partially compen-sated for by the incorporation <b>of</b> <b>acrylic</b> <b>polymers</b> or inorganic fillers. 4 ' 5 Thermal changes also cause these restorations to change dimensions at seven times the rate of tooth substance. 6 Accordingly, thermal cycling causes the margin to act as a pump that can imbibe oral fluids into regions beneath the restoration. Because acrylics have many desirable characteristics from a clinical viewpoint, a rapid method for forming an adhesive seal between an acrylic restoration and dentin would effectively improve the quality of anterior restorations. A polymeric liner, ad-hesive to dentin, in itself could provide a protective barrier and prevent caries develop-ment.

Solid dispersions {{were characterized by}} Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Powder X-ray diffractometry (PXRD), Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as solubility and in vitro dissolution studies in 0. 1 N HCl (pH 1. 2), double-distilled water and phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4). Adsorption tests from drug solution to solid polymers were also performed. A selected solid dispersion system was developed into capsule dosage form and evaluated for in vitro dissolution studies. The progressive disappearance of drug peaks in thermotropic profiles of spray-dried dispersions were related to increasing amount of polymers, while SEM studies suggested homogenous dispersion of drug in polymer. Eudragit RL 100 had a greater adsorptive capacity than Eudragit S 100, and thus its combination in (0. 5 + 1. 5) for S 100 and RL 100 exhibited a higher dissolution rate with 97. 14 % drug release for twelve hours.

The results showed that the optimum total solid content for a coating formulation was in a range of 4. 7 to 5. 7 %. Dimethyl siloxane was used in a formulation to decrease surface friction coefficient. Optimum level of dimethyl siloxane was 1. 50 g. This gave low surface friction coefficients as well as provided optimum quantity that was not too high to be inferior other properties of the coated gloves. In comparisons between the use of two types <b>of</b> <b>acrylic</b> <b>polymers,</b> it was found that coating formulation using NeoCryl A- 45 provided better coated gloves quality in terms of tensile strength, 500 % modulus and elongation at break. This is attributed to the ability of acrylic polymer to promote adhesion to rubber surface and to provide high flexibility to the coated rubber gloves. Influence of ration of DPNR-g-PMMA to NeoCryl A- 45 was also studied. The results showed that rations of 1 : 2 and 2 : 1 gave high quality coated rubber gloves.

Some of these applications cause interactions between the polymer and contact medium such as food contact materials, eyeglasses, contact lenses or toys.

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the basic diffusion properties <b>of</b> <b>acrylic</b> <b>polymers</b> with respect to representative monomers in order to establish a scientific basis for migration modelling simulating the mass transport of monomers from the polymers when they are in contact with foods, human skin or body fluids such as sweat and saliva. For this purpose, 11 representative acrylic polymers containing five different acrylic monomers (MA, EA, BA, MMA and nBMA) were studied in extensive kinetic migrations experiments in contact with five different contact media (simulants) at three different temperatures (20 °C, 40 °C and 60 °C). The simulants were selected according to the applications: toys were simulated by saliva simulant and articles coming in contact with human skin by sweat simulant. For food contact applications, water (aqueous foods), Miglyol 840 (Sasol, Witten, Germany) (fatty food) and Tenax® (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Munich, Germany) (an adsorbent simulating dry foods) were selected. The diffusion coefficients (D) of the monomers in the polymer as well as partition coefficients between polymer and contact media were derived. It was found that those acrylic polymer materials used for rigid plastics applications exhibit extremely low diffusion behaviour, whereas acrylic polymer resins used for coating applications showed somewhat higher diffusion behaviour but this still at very low rates in comparison with other typical polymers used for the manufacture of food packaging materials. As a result, conservative polymer-specific constants in support of migration modelling were established, and the specifications for the model general applicability were determined and specified. The parameter related to the polymers' intrinsic mobility is applicable to model migration of any other organic chemical substances, which may be present in acrylic polymers as potential migrants when they have comparable or higher molecular weights than the studied monomers...|$|E
