5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> alone may not predict {{communicative}} achievement, <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on <b>object</b> <b>permanence.</b> They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring <b>object</b> <b>permanence,</b> was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> has been how {{physical}} disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of <b>object</b> <b>permanence.</b> In a study that was performed in 1975-76, {{the results showed that}} the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} years, the {{original}} Piagetian <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> account {{has been challenged}} {{by a series of}} infant studies suggesting that much younger infants do have a clear sense that objects exist even when out of sight. Bower showed <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> in 3-month-olds. This goes against Piaget's coordination of secondary circular reactions stage because infants aren't supposed to understand that a completely hidden object still exists until they are eight to twelve months old. The two studies below demonstrate this idea.|$|E

They have been justified {{on the basis}} of a categorization of Roma as nomads, and been challenged and criticized by Roma rights activists and international organizations. Their regulation and actor system have been object of several judicial inquiries for corruption. But they persist. Mixing different sources (semi-structured interviews, observations, and analysis of budgets) we describe the architecture of different Roma camps in Rome. We relate to four main dimensions of the relations between architecture and the space (boundaries, distribution of <b>objects,</b> <b>permanence,</b> and symbolic orders). Previous research in organizational theory has shown that architecture and interior design have a structuring and enacting power for social relations. To explain the persistence of these architecture forms, and the absence of social innovation, we look at the strategic action fields in which the camps are embedded, discussing the relevance of “invisible” relations...|$|R

40|$|Preschool {{children}} and adults observed an instance of object discontinuity. Despite the fact that, in conversation, subjects denied the possibility of material <b>objects</b> that lack <b>permanence</b> of existence, most of them dealt with the phenomenon as if magic {{was involved in the}} transmogrification of a postage stamp. The subjective probability of belief in object discontinuity was similar to that of belief in the existence of other enigmatic phenomena, such as UFOs, parapsychological phenomena, or the Loch Ness monster. The role of adults' and children's beliefs in discontinuous objects is discussed...|$|R
5|$|<b>Object</b> <b>permanence</b> is the {{understanding}} that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be observed (seen, heard, touched, smelled or sensed in any way). This is a fundamental concept studied {{in the field of}} developmental psychology, the subfield of psychology that addresses the development of young children's social and mental capacities. There is not yet scientific consensus on when {{the understanding}} of <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> emerges in human development.|$|E
5|$|Other, {{more recent}} {{studies suggest that}} the idea of <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> may not be an innate {{function}} of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E
5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand <b>object</b> <b>permanence,</b> which explains why they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E
50|$|Numbering and marking {{an object}} (usually with the object's {{accession}} number) {{is part of}} the initial cataloging process, which also includes standard procedures for measuring, photographing, and examining the condition of objects. Marking an object with its accession number (or temporary number if the object will not become part of the permanent collection) is how the object is identified and linked to its documentation. In order to track museum collections, to differentiate between permanent, loan, and subsidiary collections, and to provide access to the documentation of objects in the collection, systematic numbering schemes are used and each unique number is marked or tagged on the objects and prominently noted on all documentation associated with the objects. There are many ways to mark objects with their numbers. Depending on the type of <b>object</b> and desired <b>permanence</b> of the mark, some of the preferred methods include: archival quality paper tags with pencil, barrier coat with ink or paint, adhered labels, labels sewn with cotton tape, Reemay, or Tyvek, pencil directly on object (recommended for paper and photographs mostly), and Bar codes/RFID technology.|$|R
40|$|Most {{research}} on infants' development of object and spatial concepts {{is based on}} object search tasks or visual tracking studies. In this review, it is concluded that many phenomena, particularly the tracking data, can be accounted for in terms of objective spatial perception in early infancy. However, some phenomena, particularly the stage IV search error, cannot be explained in these terms. A theoretical framework is put forward that integrates aspects of theory of direct perception with constructionist theory. First, it is proposed that objective properties of the basic spatial array are directly perceived, but that because perception is derived from action in the environment, there are initial limits to the scope and coherence of perception that diminish as the infant gains effective motor control. Second, it is proposed that in attempts to decipher the structure of social interchanges over objects, infants construct functional categorizations of objects {{that allow them to}} overcome limited awareness of their physical properties. Finally, it is suggested that these functional concepts provide an adequate means of interpreting the world, so that concepts based on the physical properties of <b>objects,</b> including their <b>permanence,</b> are relatively late developments...|$|R
40|$|This study {{offers a}} {{reconstructive}} {{account of the}} concept of pure synthesis as it occurs in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. In order to make sense of a pure sensible synthesis, {{it will be necessary to}} provide a detailed account of the transcendental processes that are derived from the subjective sources of the mind prior to any working account of the logical functions ofjudgment. Stated succinct. ~y, our approach will deal with the concept of synthesis from a transcendental 'psycholo'gical perspective. I will argue that a metalevel of transcendental psychology can be uncovered that releases certain functions for concepts of comparison that is different to how Kant stipulates their use in the Amphiboly of Concepts of Reflection section of the Critique. To supplement an account of pure sensible synthesis, I will argue that what I call a 'pure rule of apprehension' or a 'pure rule of synthesis' is constructed out of concepts of comparison and functions as a pure sensible schema. The 'pure rule of apprehension' is modelled on the fundamental action of Kant's Pure Synthesis of Apprehension as it appears in the A Version of the Transcendental Deduction. The rule of synthesis acts as an original schema that can be applied directly to the pl!re manifolds oftime and space prior to objects. It will be argued that the concept of pure sensible synthesis and its accompanying pure sensible schema carry out an ontological function as transcendental elements prior to the reflections carried out by the categories, and prior to the comparisons of empirical representations that first generate concepts of objects. The reconstruction of synthesis and a corresponding schema constitutes the first two main stages of the thesis in Chapters One and Two. This part of the thesis will relate to the area of Kant scholarship that pays particular attention to the subjective sources of the mind, especially the role of the transcendental synthesis of imagination and the determination of intuitions in the Critique. I will subject certain authors to a series of close readings in order to develop the concepts of pure sensible synthesis and a pure sensible schema. In the third and fourth stages of the thesis will move away from the concepts of synthesis and schematism. In Chapter Three I will develop a line of argument that sheds new light on the concept of an object prior to synthesis by examining Kant's Refutation ofIdealism. I will argue that it is possible to conceive of a pure transcendental 'place' or 'location' of a pure <b>object</b> of <b>permanence</b> not mentioned by Kant, by making use of concepts of comparison functioning as pure orientational concepts. In the Fourth Chapter I will round the study off by expounding the central conceptual processes that are at work in the project as a whole, which differ significantly from the way' that Kant employs I' concepts in the first Critique. I will argue that concepts of comparison exhibit functions that are not confined to discursive procedures involved in generating concepts of objects. This completes the thesis. The project starts by examining the concept of synthesis, before moving on to the related theme of schematism. I then deal with the concept of an object, finishing with an examination of the nature of conceptualitx that unifies the project as a whole.

25|$|As Piaget {{believed}} {{development was}} a universal process, his initial sample sizes were inadequate, {{particularly in the}} formulation of his theory of infant development. Piaget’s theories of infant development were based on his observations of his own three children. While this clearly presents problems with the sample size, Piaget also probably introduced confounding variables and social desirability into his observations and his conclusions based on his observations. It is entirely possible Piaget conditioned his children to respond in a desirable manner, so, rather than having an understanding of <b>object</b> <b>permanence,</b> his children might have learned to behave in a manner that indicated they understood <b>object</b> <b>permanence.</b> The sample was also very homogenous, as all three children had a similar genetic heritage and environment. Piaget did, however, have larger sample sizes during his later years.|$|E

25|$|Bowlby's {{reliance}} on Piaget's theory of cognitive development {{gave rise to}} questions about <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> (the ability to remember an object that is temporarily absent) and its connection to early attachment behaviours, and {{about the fact that}} the infant's ability to discriminate strangers and react to the mother's absence seems to occur some months earlier than Piaget suggested would be cognitively possible. More recently, it has been noted that the understanding of mental representation has advanced so much since Bowlby's day that present views can be far more specific than those of Bowlby's time.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} {{self-recognition}} in mirrors {{is independent of}} familiarity with reflecting surfaces. In some cases the rouge test {{has been shown to}} have differing results, depending on sociocultural orientation. For example, a Cameroonian Nso sample of infants 18 to 20 months of age had an extremely low amount of self-recognition outcomes at 3.2%. The study also found two strong predictors of self-recognition: object stimulation (maternal effort of attracting the attention of the infant to an object either person touched) and mutual eye contact. A strong correlation between self-concept and <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> have also been demonstrated using the rouge test.|$|E
25|$|At {{around the}} same time Curtiss began her work, doctors reevaluated Genie on the Leiter scale and {{measured}} her on the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale, which placed her estimated mental age between a 5- and 8-year-old with a very high degree of scatter. Doctors believed Genie had learned to use her gestalt perception to determine the number of objects in a group, and by the start of the case study she could accurately discern the correct number of up to 7 objects via gestalt perception. Child psychologist David Elkind, who was involved in the grant meetings, evaluated Genie in May 1971 and reported that she was in the concrete operational stage of development, noting that she understood <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> and could engage in deferred imitation. Genie's physical health also continued to improve, and by this time her endurance had dramatically increased. Her social behavior was still highly abnormal, and doctors were especially concerned that she almost never interacted with people her age, but evaluations from the time expressed some optimism about her prognosis.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{alternative}} {{theories of}} Child Development {{have been put}} forward, and empirical findings {{have done a lot}} to undermine Piaget's theories. For example, Esther Thelen and colleagues found that babies would not make the A-not-B error if they had small weights added to their arms during {{the first phase of the}} experiment that were then removed before the second phase of the experiment. This minor change should not impact babies' understanding of <b>object</b> <b>permanence,</b> so the difference that this makes to babies' performance on the A-not-B task cannot be explained by Piagetian theory. Thelen and colleagues also found that various other factors also influenced performance on the A-not-B task (including strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time and stance), and proposed that this could be better explained using a dynamic systems theory approach than using Piagetian theory. Alison Gopnik and Betty Repacholi found that babies as young as 18 months old can understand that other people have desires, and that these desires could be very different from their own desires. This strongly contradicts Piaget's view that children are very egocentric at this age. In reaction to these challenges, it has been argued that their criticisms depend on a fundamental misreading of Piaget's theory (Lourenço & Machado, 1996).|$|E
500|$|Developmental {{psychologist}} Jean Piaget conducted {{experiments that}} collected behavioral tests on infants. Piaget studied <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> by observing infants' reactions when a favorite object or toy was presented {{and then was}} covered with a blanket or removed from sight. <b>Object</b> <b>permanence</b> is considered {{to be one of the}} earliest methods for evaluating working memory. [...] An infant that has started to develop <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> might reach for the toy or try to grab the blanket off the toy. Infants that have not yet developed this might appear confused. Piaget interpreted these behavioral signs as evidence of a belief that the object had [...] ceased to exist. Reactions of most infants that had already started developing <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> were of frustration because they knew it existed, but didn't know where it was. However, the reaction of infants that had not yet started developing <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> was more oblivious. If an infant searched for the object, it was assumed that they believed it continued to exist.|$|E

500|$|Jean Piaget, the Swiss {{psychologist}} who first studied <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> in infants, argued that <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> {{is one of}} an infant's most important accomplishments, as, without this concept, objects would have no separate, permanent existence. In Piaget's theory of cognitive development, infants develop this understanding {{by the end of}} the [...] "sensorimotor stage," [...] which lasts from birth to about two years of age. Piaget thought that an infant's perception and understanding of the world depended on their motor development, which was required for the infant to link visual, tactile and motor representations of objects. According to this view, it is through touching and handling objects that infants develop <b>object</b> <b>permanence.</b>|$|E

500|$|Experiments in {{non-human}} primates {{suggest that}} monkeys can track {{the displacement of}} invisible targets, that invisible displacement is represented in the prefrontal cortex, and that development of the frontal cortex {{is linked to the}} acquisition of <b>object</b> <b>permanence.</b> [...] Various evidence from human infants is consistent with this. [...] For example, formation of synapses in the frontal cortex peaks during human infancy, and recent experiments using near infrared spectroscopy to gather neuroimaging data from infants suggests that activity in the frontal cortex is associated with successful completion of <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> tasks.|$|E
500|$|However, {{many other}} types of animals {{have been shown to}} have the ability for <b>object</b> <b>permanence.</b> These include dogs, cats, and a few species of birds such as the carrion crow, Eurasian jays and food-storing magpies. [...] Dogs are able to reach a level of <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> that allows them to find food after it has been hidden beneath one of two cups and rotated 90°. [...] Similarly, cats are able to {{understand}} <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> but not to the same extent that dogs can. Cats fail to understand that if they see something go into an apparatus in one direction that it will still be there if the cat tries to enter from another direction. However, while cats {{did not seem to be}} quite as good at this ‘invisible displacement test’ as dogs are, it’s hard to say whether their poorer performance is a true reflection of their abilities or just due to the way in which they’ve been tested. A longitudinal study found that carrion crows' ability developed gradually, albeit with slight changes in the order of mastery compared to human infants. There was only one task, task 15, that the crows were not able to master. The crows showed perseverative searches at a previously rewarded location (the so-called ‘A-not-B error’). They mastered visible rotational displacements consistently, but failed at more complex invisible rotational displacements. [...] Another study tested the comparison of how long it took food-storing magpies to develop the <b>object</b> <b>permanence</b> necessary for them to be able to live independently. [...] The research suggests that these magpies followed a very similar pattern as human infants while they were developing.|$|E

[...] If a toy is hidden in a matchbox then the matchbox put under a pillow and then, without the child seeing, the toy is slipped out of the matchbox and the matchbox then given to the child, the child will look under the pillow upon discovery that it is not in the matchbox.

500|$|The {{first study}} showed infants a toy car that moved down an {{inclined}} track, disappeared behind a screen, and then reemerged {{at the other}} end, still on the track. The researchers created a [...] "possible event" [...] where a toy mouse was placed behind the tracks but was hidden by the screen as the car rolled by. Then, researchers created an [...] "impossible event." [...] In this situation, the toy mouse {{was placed on the}} tracks but was secretly removed after the screen was lowered so that the car seemed to go through the mouse. [...] Also in the 1991 study the researchers used an experiment involving two differently sized carrots (one tall and one short) in order to test the infants response when the carrots would be moved behind a short wall. [...] The wall was specifically designed to make the short carrot disappear, as well as tested the infants for habituation patterns on the disappearance of the tall carrot behind the wall (impossible event). Infants as young as 3½ months displayed greater stimulation toward the impossible event and much more habituation at the possible event. This indicated that they may have been surprised by the impossible event, which suggested they remembered not only that the toy mouse still existed (<b>object</b> <b>permanence)</b> but also its location. The same was true of the tall carrot in the second experiment. [...] This research suggests that infants understand more about objects earlier than Piaget proposed.|$|E

One test for YouTube was done as follows: A macaw was shown an item; the item was then hidden behind {{the back of the}} trainer and placed into a container. The container it was placed in without the macaw seeing, along with another container and multiple objects, were spread upon a table simultaneously. The specific container that the item was stored in out of the macaws' sight was one that the macaw had never observed before. The macaw searched this some, then another container, then returning to open the correct container to demonstrate knowledge of and the ability to search for the item.|$|E
