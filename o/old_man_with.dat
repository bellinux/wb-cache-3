5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E

25|$|Critics often cite certain {{works by}} García Márquez, such as A Very <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> Enormous Wings and One Hundred Years of Solitude, as {{exemplary}} of magic realism, {{a style of}} writing in which the supernatural is presented as mundane, and the mundane as supernatural or extraordinary.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the correlation between}} serum Omentin- 1 levels {{and the presence of}} osteoporosis in <b>older</b> <b>men.</b> MethodsSerum Omentin- 1, bone turnover biochemical markers, and bone mineral density (BMD) were determined in 45 <b>older</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> osteoporosis or 45 <b>older</b> <b>men</b> without osteoporosis (65 – 70 years old). ResultsOmentin- 1 levels were increased in <b>older</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> osteoporosis, and the differences remained significant after controlling for fat mass. Omentin- 1 was negatively correlated with BMD. In a multiple linear stepwise regression analysis, Omentin- 1, lean mass, but not fat mass, were independent predictors of BMD for the combined group. Significant negative correlations between Omentin- 1 and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and bone cross-linked N-telopeptides of type Ⅰ collagen (NTX) were found. Omentin- 1 was also independently associated with BMD and bone turnover markers in <b>older</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> osteoporosis and control groups that were considered separately. ConclusionsOmentin- 1 is an independent predictor of BMD in <b>older</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> osteoporosis, and it is negatively correlated with bone turnover biochemical markers. It is suggested that Omentin- 1 may exert a negative effect on bone mass through the regulation of the osteoblast differentiation in the <b>older</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> osteoporosis...|$|R

40|$|Background: Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} the variation in oestradiol with respect to age and circadian rhythm and the subsequent effects on BMD. Aim: Demonstrate {{the presence or absence of}} a circadian rhythm for oestrodial in <b>older</b> <b>men</b> and the integral role of concerted circadian rhythms of several factors including parathyroid hormone (PTH) in regulating biochemical markers of bone resorption and formation. Examine whether concentrations of both circulating total and bioavailable oestrogen in <b>men</b> differ <b>with</b> age and BMD. Design: Males were recruited: young <b>men</b> <b>with</b> normal BMD, <b>older</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> normal BMD and <b>older</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> osteoporosis. Methods: Subjects were hospitalized for a 25 -hour period. Blood samples were obtained every 30 minutes. Hormone analysis results were plotted and reviewed. Results: Both total and bioavailable oestradiol concentrations were significantly lower in the <b>older</b> <b>men</b> than the young men (Total oestradiol: 34. 5 ± 4. 4 pmol/L vs. 49. 0 ± 6. 5 pmol/L, p< 0. 0001; Bioavailable oestradiol 16. 7 ± 2. 2 pmol/L vs. 26. 3 ± 3. 6 pmol/L, p< 0. 0001). Bioavailable oestrogen rhythm mirrored that of total estrogen. Conclusion: Both age groups with normal BMD display circadian rhythmicity with respect to circulating and bioavailable oestradiol. Younger men have increased mean total and bioavailable oestrogen concentrations and later acrophase compared to older counterparts. In <b>older</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> low BMD, total circulating oestrogen was not significantly different compared to age-matched <b>older</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> normal BMD; bioavailable oestrogen was significantly lower. Total oestrogen demonstrated a concerted circadian rhythm in all 3 groups, but bioavailable oestrogen did not demonstrate circadian rhythmicity in <b>older</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> decreased BMD...|$|R

25|$|Some {{statues of}} Joseph depict his staff as topped with flowers, recalling the non-canonical Protoevangelion's {{account of how}} Mary's spouse was chosen by {{collecting}} the walking sticks of widowers in Palestine, and Joseph's alone bursting into flower, thus identifying him as divinely chosen. The Golden Legend, which derives its account from the much older Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, tells a similar story, although it notes that all marriageable men of the Davidic line and not only widowers were ordered by the High Priest to present their rods at the Temple. Several Eastern Orthodox Nativity icons show Joseph tempted by the Devil (depicted as an <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> furled wings) to break off his betrothal, and how he resists that temptation. There are some paintings with him wearing a Jewish hat.|$|E

He then appears first as a handsome man {{and then as a}} beautiful boy. Years later, he approaches Arthur disguised as a peasant wearing leather boots, a wool coat, a hood, and a belt of knotted sheepskin. He is described as tall, black and bristly, and as seeming cruel and fierce.

25|$|Poetry {{and cruelty}} of life were harmonically {{combined}} {{in the works}} that Vittorio De Sica wrote and directed together with screenwriter Cesare Zavattini: among them, Shoeshine (1946), The Bicycle Thief (1948) and Miracle in Milan (1951). The 1952 film Umberto D. showed a poor <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> his little dog, who must beg for alms against his dignity in the loneliness of the new society. This work is perhaps De Sica's masterpiece {{and one of the}} most important works in Italian cinema. It was not a commercial success and since then it has been shown on Italian television only a few times. Yet it is perhaps the most violent attack, in the apparent quietness of the action, against the rules of the new economy, the new mentality, the new values, and it embodies both a conservative and a progressive view.|$|E
25|$|Between 1503 and 1505, Nephon {{de facto}} led the Church of Wallachia, {{until he came}} into {{conflict}} with the prince. The conflict arose because of the intransigence of the patriarch in refusing to celebrate the marriage of Radu's older sister Calpea with the Moldovan boyar Bogdan Logothete, who had already been married. Threatened by Radu, Nephon gathered the people, made a speech, and excommunicated the groom. He also prophesied accidents, left the patriarchal vestments on the altar and departed the church, taking to a deserted hut. In {{order to avoid the}} outcry of the people, Radu tried to placate the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> flattering words, promises and gifts and begged him to forgive his brother-in-law, but Nephon remained adamant and left for Macedonia, taking with him two of his students.

40|$|It’s {{the most}} common cancer among men. Prostate cancer will affect one in five men {{at some point in}} their lifetime, usually men over the age of forty. Fortu-nately, most {{prostate}} cancers are rela-tively slow growing. On the other hand, a new study published in the Journal of Urology (Vol. 185, pp. 132 - 7, 2010) showed that <b>older</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> prostate can-cer may have a more aggressive course. When researchers looked at the records of over 12, 000 men, they found that <b>men</b> <b>older</b> than age 70 with prostate cancer were more likely to have an ag-gressive course of disease than younger men. Not only that, but prostate cancer mortality was higher in these men. Experts previously believed that most prostate cancers were slow growing even in <b>older</b> <b>men,</b> so most doctors advocated a less aggressive treatment approach for <b>older</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> prostate cancer due to their shorter overall life expectancy. This means that many <b>older</b> <b>men</b> haven’t been offered radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT) due to the belief that they’ll die of other causes before their prostate cancer takes their life.
