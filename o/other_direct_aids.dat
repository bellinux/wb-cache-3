40|$|In this paper, we analyze an {{environmental}} policy {{that is designed}} to reduce the emission of pollutants when there is uncertainty over the social costs of environmental damage. We first establish a model that incorporates <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> in which there are two noncooperative agents: a developing country and a developed country. Next, we derive closed-form solutions for the optimal levels of <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> that the developed country provides the developing country. Finally, we compare the social welfare level implied by this model with those implied by two additional models. In one of the models, two agents cooperate, and in the other, the agents donot cooperate and there is no <b>direct</b> <b>aid.</b> As a result, the means of providing <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> {{plays an important role in}} reducing the decline in social welfare caused by external effects...|$|R

25|$|Generally, DG {{work can}} be seen as taking two approaches: one views democratization as a {{political}} struggle between democrats and non-democrats and <b>directs</b> <b>aid</b> toward political processes and institutions such as elections, political parties, and civil society; and the second views democratization as a slower, longer-term process and <b>directs</b> <b>aid</b> at a wide range of political and socioeconomic sectors. In terms of implementation, donor country development agencies, such as USAID, UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), design and fund programs (according to donor country interests and local needs) that are often carried out by international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in coordination with local and international groups.|$|R

Tom Frost and I had made the second ascent of this route, mostly with <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> in the early sixties. That one could climb this route without resorting to <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> was impressive. To do it without a rope was astonishing. But such was Peter's level of mastery. That it was mastery, and not mere daring was proven by a string of free solos of similar stature, executed to perfection." ...|$|R
30|$|Schmid et al. (2006) claimed that, in most cases, DPs do {{not prevent}} a {{relevant}} share of European farmers from {{remaining in the}} poorest decile, and other authors (Allanson and Rocchi 2008; Mishra et al. 2009) confirmed that the distribution of <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> is largely unequal because high-income farms receive {{a large share of}} the payments, as do the wealthiest farm households (Rocchi et al. 2005). Conversely, El Benni and Finger (2012) showed that <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> can reduce the inequality in the distribution of FIs. Keeney (2000) stated that after the introduction of the McSharry reform, <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> payments, although they were strongly concentrated, had a redistributive role in Ireland and were able to reduce the unequal effects on market incomes due to the increasing share of DPs in FIs. Thus, without DPs, the concentration of farm income and its unequal distribution across farms might have increased. In that context, the process of liberalizing global agricultural markets has led to an increasing share of farmers who generate negative market incomes, a situation that is unheard of in any other sector (El Benni and Finger 2012).|$|R

500|$|The South as a whole, however, {{remained}} divided. In January 1853 Senator Thomas Jefferson Rusk of Texas {{introduced a}} bill to create two railroads, one with a northern route and one with a southern route starting below Memphis on the Mississippi River.

[...] Some southerners, however, worried that northern and central interests would leap ahead in construction and opposed any <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> to private developers on constitutional grounds. [...] Other southerners preferred the isthmian proposals.
