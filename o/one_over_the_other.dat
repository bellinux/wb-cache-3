5|$|The church's {{appearance}} in the mid-16th century, shortly before its completion, is known from a woodcut by Girolamo Franzini. Its facade appears almost square; at its center there was a portal with a tympanum, surmounted by a large fanlight opened by a round window. On its side were three rows of pilasters with two pairs of niches, <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> A bell-gable was {{on one side of}} the roof.|$|E
5|$|Tiru Parameswara Vinnagaram is {{the birthplace}} of the azhwar saint, Poigai Alvar. The central shrine has a three-tier shrine, <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> with Vishnu {{depicted}} in each of them. The corridor around the sanctum has a series of sculptures depicting the Pallava rule and conquest. It is the oldest Vishnu temple in the city and was built by the Pallava king Paramesvaravarman II (728–731).|$|E
5|$|Some mammals are omnivores {{and display}} {{varying degrees of}} carnivory and herbivory, {{generally}} leaning in favor of one more than the other. Since plants and meat are digested differently, there is a preference for <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> as in bears where some species may be mostly carnivorous and others mostly herbivorous. They are grouped into three categories: mesocarnivory (50-70% meat), hypercarnivory (70% and greater of meat), and hypocarnivory (50% or less of meat). The dentition of hypocarnivores consists of dull, triangular carnassial teeth meant for grinding food. Hypercarnivores, however, have conical teeth and sharp carnassials meant for slashing, {{and in some cases}} strong jaws for bone-crushing, {{as in the case of}} hyenas, allowing them to consume bones; some extinct groups, notably the Machairodontinae, had saber-shaped canines.|$|E

25|$|Famous {{players and}} {{football}} figures often give their {{opinion on the}} Maradona and Pelé rivalry, sometimes choosing <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Others prefer not to compare them, as they played in very different times. Perhaps {{one of the most}} reliable comparisons available is that by the Ballon d'Or winners (elected since 1956 by voters of several countries, and arguably greatest ones to properly appreciate both players). Pelé was elected Best Player of the Century for Ballon d'Or winners and Maradona was the runner-up.|$|E
40|$|Q: What is {{the best}} {{beta-blocker}} for systolic heart failure? Evidence-based answer: Three beta-blockers—carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, and bisoprolol—reduce mortality equally (by about 30 % <b>over</b> <b>one</b> year) in patients with Class III or IV systolic heart failure.

25|$|A {{representation}} {{is a type}} of recording in which the sensory information about a physical object is described in a medium. The degree to which an artistic representation resembles the object it represents is a function of resolution and does not bear on the denotation of the word. For example, both the Mona Lisa and a child's crayon drawing of Lisa del Giocondo would be considered representational, and any preference for <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> would need to be understood as a matter of aesthetics.|$|E

The upper level is the reverse. Each level allows cross-platform interchange {{between the two}} lines. The BMT Broadway Line passes overhead near {{the west end of}} the station; this crossing is visible in the ceiling and supporting columns.|$|E

The US recommendation is 6RZE with the option of adding a quinolone such as moxifloxacin.

50|$|Accordingly, since {{by nature}} {{all men are}} free, any {{authority}} by which subjects are prevented from doing evil and their freedom is restrained to doing good through fear from penalties, comes solely from harmony and from {{the consent of the}} subjects, whether the authority reside in written law or in the living law which is in the ruler. For if by nature men are equally strong and equally free, the true and settled power of <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> <b>the</b> ruler having equal natural power, could be set up only by the choice and consent of <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> just as a law also is set up by consent.|$|R

25|$|Avery et al. {{pioneered the}} use of choice {{modelling}} to rank colleges. Their methodology used a statistical analysis of the decisions of 3,240 students who applied to college in 1999. MyChances.net, now called Parchment, adopted a similar approach starting in 2009, stating that its method is based on this approach. The study analysed students admitted to multiple colleges. The college they attended became the winner, and the others became the losers. An Elo rating system was used to assign points based on each win or loss, and the colleges were ranked based on their Elo points. A useful consequence of {{the use of}} Elo points is that they can be used to estimate the frequency with which students, upon being admitted to two schools, will choose <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Most recent preference ranking placed Stanford at the top, followed by MIT, Harvard, and Princeton.|$|E
