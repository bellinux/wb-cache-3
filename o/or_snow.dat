5|$|The tornado {{outbreak}} of February 10–11, 2009 occurred on February10 and February11, 2009, affecting portions {{of both the}} Central and Eastern United States. During the two-day period, 15tornadoes touched down in seven states. Oklahoma was struck by six tornadoes, {{the most of any}} state. The first day of the outbreak produced the most tornadoes; the second brought mainly high wind damage and rain <b>or</b> <b>snow</b> in most of the Northeast.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority {{announced}} plans to renovate the train station. This, along the village's plans to revitalize the entire village of Sloatsburg, was thought to give the bland train station a more traditional look. This would include adding a roof to protect commuters and visitors from the elements, such as rain <b>or</b> <b>snow,</b> handicap-accessible ramps for wheelchairs, better lighting, more seats for people to wait, and a heated shelter. (A shelter exists, but is not heated). The village also wants to use a $50,000 grant from the state to construct a large municipal parking lot near the station. This would get more people to use the station, as because {{with the lack of}} facilities, the station is under-used. The preliminary design was made by Jeff Livingston, an architect on the Sloatsburg Revitalization Committee.|$|E

5|$|Modern winter service {{vehicles}} will usually {{also have a}} satellite navigation system connected to a weather forecast feed, allowing the driver to choose the best areas to treat and to avoid areas in which rain is likely, which can wash away the grit used—the most advanced can even adapt to changing conditions, ensuring optimal gritter and plow settings. Most run on wheels, often with snow chains or studded tires, but some are mounted on caterpillar tracks, with the tracks themselves adapted to throw the snow towards {{the side of the}} road. Off-road winter {{service vehicles}} mounted on caterpillar tracks are known as snowcats. Snowcats are commonly fitted with snowplows <b>or</b> <b>snow</b> groomers, and are used by ski resorts to smooth and maintain pistes and snowmobile runs, although they can also be used as a replacement for chairlifts.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers {{all agree}} that Andrée's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he wanted to go, on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice <b>or</b> <b>snow</b> sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{hill was}} used for 31 tournaments, of which six had to be {{cancelled}} because of wind <b>or</b> <b>snow</b> conditions. The tournaments included the Norwegian Championships in 1973, 1978 and 1983; the Norwegian champions in Balbergbakken were Nils-Per Skarseth (1973) and Per Bergerud (1978 and 1983). A FIS Ski Jumping World Cup race was held on 9 March 1984. It saw Pavel Ploc win ahead of Matti Nykänen and Ernst Vettori. The event drew 5,000 spectators. The World Cup race incurred a large loss, with the organizers only covering half of the NOK260,000 it cost to host. The hill record was set by Tom Levorstad in 1981, who reached 130.5meters. The final race {{was scheduled to be}} the 1992 Junior Norwegian Championships, but they were canceled because of lack of snow.|$|E

5000|$|In {{snowfall}} conditions, {{the volume}} of snow falling may obscure objects reducing visibility to near zero. An {{example of this is}} during lake-effect <b>snow</b> <b>or</b> mountain-effect <b>snow,</b> where {{the volume of}} snow can be many times greater than normal <b>snows</b> <b>or</b> blizzards.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{chemical}} weathering, the coppered dome {{now appears to}} have a more brownish black color. When it rains <b>or</b> <b>snows,</b> carbonic acid is created due to the water’s reaction with the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.|$|R
5|$|Wheels {{are prone}} to slipping—an {{inability}} to generate traction—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead {{to a loss of}} control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud <b>or</b> <b>snow.</b> This limitation of wheels {{can be seen in the}} realm of human technology: in an example of biologically inspired engineering, legged vehicles find use in the logging industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate. Tracked vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground—but they tend to have larger turning radii than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} {{have been}} improved from Diamond and Pearl. The dialog boxes of previous games {{have been changed}} to speech balloons that appear over other characters' heads, allowing more than one character to speak at once. Japanese players can have kanji appear on screen, rather than only hiragana and katakana. During battles, the sprites of the Pokémon are fully animated and the camera changes position to highlight specific parts of the battle. In addition to continuing the day and night cycle introduced in Gold and Silver, Black and White introduces a seasonal cycle, with the seasons advancing every month rather than being linked to the calendar. Outside areas appear differently depending on the season, such as changing of leaves in autumn <b>or</b> <b>snow</b> on the ground in winter. Certain areas are only accessible during certain seasons, and different Pokémon {{can be found in the}} wild in winter where others are encountered in the other seasons. The Pokémon Deerling and Sawsbuck change their physical appearance to match the seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{life history}} of the long-toed {{salamander}} varies greatly with elevation and climate. Seasonal dates of migration {{to and from the}} breeding ponds can be correlated with bouts of sustained rainfall, ice thaw, <b>or</b> <b>snow</b> melt sufficient to replenish the (often) seasonal ponds. Eggs may be spawned at low elevations as early as mid-February in southern Oregon, from early January to July in northwestern Washington, from January to March in southeastern Washington, and from mid-April to early May in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta. The timing of breeding can be highly variable; of notable mention, several egg masses in early stages of development were found on July 8, 1999 along the British Columbia provincial border outside Jasper, Alberta. Adults migrate seasonally to return to their natal breeding ponds, with males arriving earlier and staying longer than females, and some individuals have been seen migrating along snow banks on warm spring days. Gender differences (or sexual dimorphism) in this species are only apparent during the breeding season, when mature males display an enlarged or bulbous vent area.|$|E
25|$|Kite {{boards of}} {{different}} description are used {{on dry land}} <b>or</b> on <b>snow.</b> Kite landboarding {{involves the use of}} a mountain board or land board—a skateboard with large pneumatic wheels and foot-straps. Snow kiting is an outdoor winter sport where people use kite power to glide on a board (<b>or</b> skis) over <b>snow</b> <b>or</b> ice.|$|R
50|$|The {{average of}} the {{findings}} would be taken by methodical record-keepers such that, for example, if it rained <b>or</b> <b>snowed</b> on the 7th, 18th, or the 31st at 7:00 a.m. and/or at 6:00 p.m., the cabañuela would show that July would be a wet month.|$|R
50|$|Salix herbacea (dwarf willow, least willow <b>or</b> <b>snowbed</b> willow) is {{a species}} of tiny {{creeping}} willow (family Salicaceae) adapted to survive in harsh arctic and subarctic environments. Distributed widely in alpine and arctic environments around the North Atlantic Ocean, {{it is one of}} the smallest of woody plants.|$|R
5|$|The sea {{plays a part}} in {{the water}} cycle, in which water evaporates from the ocean, travels through the {{atmosphere}} as vapor, condenses, falls (usually as rain <b>or</b> <b>snow)</b> again, and then largely returns to the sea. Even in the Atacama Desert, where little rain ever falls, dense clouds of fog known as the camanchaca blow in from the sea and support plant life. In large land masses, geologic features can block the access of some regions to the main sea. These endorheic basins, particularly in central Asia, sometimes build up permanent salt lakes as inflowing waters evaporate and their dissolved minerals accumulate over time. The largest of these is the Caspian Sea, although it is sometimes counted as a proper sea owing to its basin of (now-landlocked) oceanic crust. Other notable examples include the Aral Sea in central Asia and the Great Salt Lake in the western United States. The waters of these basins still eventually return to the sea through evaporation, the flow of ground water, and (over geologic time) the opening up of the basins by continental drift.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{hazards of}} {{rockfall}} {{as well as}} avalanches and falling ice, the road is closed by the state Department of Transportation during periods of heavy rain <b>or</b> <b>snow.</b> In 1934, a landslide on Storm King Mountain crossed the highway and resulted in three fatalities {{and the destruction of}} three automobiles.|$|E
25|$|The same theory {{explains}} why small water droplets (or ice crystals) can remain suspended in air (as clouds) until they grow to a critical size and start falling as rain (<b>or</b> <b>snow</b> and hail). Similar {{use of the}} equation {{can be made in}} the settlement of fine particles in water or other fluids.|$|E
25|$|While {{the weather}} {{on the eastern}} side of the {{mountain}} is generally better, rain <b>or</b> <b>snow</b> can quickly become widespread on that side as well if the wind turns to the south or southeast.
