5|$|The {{spore print}} is pale cream. Spores are smooth, {{thin-walled}} and hyaline (translucent), roughly spherical to broadly egg-shaped, and measure 5.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5µm. They usually contain a single, large refractive oil droplet. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 30–45 by 6–10µm. The cap cuticle is a trichodermium (where the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, {{perpendicular to the}} cap surface) <b>of</b> <b>narrow,</b> club-shaped cells that are 2.5–4µm wide. Underneath this tissue is the subhymenial layer of interwoven hyphae measuring 10–20µm in diameter.

5|$|Scientists have {{suggested}} that the unique skull shape of Majungasaurus and other abelisaurids indicate different predatory habits than other theropods. Whereas most theropods were characterized by long, low skulls <b>of</b> <b>narrow</b> width, abelisaurid skulls were taller and wider, and often shorter in length as well. The narrow skulls of other theropods were well equipped to withstand the vertical stress of a powerful bite, but not as good at withstanding torsion (twisting). In comparison to modern mammalian predators, most theropods may have used a strategy similar in some ways to that of long- and narrow-snouted canids, with the delivery of many bites weakening the prey animal.|$|E
5|$|The City was {{essentially}} medieval in its street plan, an overcrowded warren <b>of</b> <b>narrow,</b> winding, cobbled alleys. It had experienced several major fires before 1666, {{the most recent}} in 1632. Building with wood and roofing with thatch had been prohibited for centuries, but these cheap materials continued to be used. The only major stone-built area was the wealthy centre of the City, where the mansions of the merchants and brokers stood on spacious lots, surrounded by an inner ring of overcrowded poorer parishes whose every inch of building space was used to accommodate the rapidly growing population. These parishes contained workplaces, {{many of which were}} fire hazards—foundries, smithies, glaziers—which were theoretically illegal in the City but tolerated in practice.|$|E

The Bairro da Matriz, whose nucleus was the centre from whence the city grew, is intersected by 14th century narrow and twisted streets lined by single family homes. The historical district has old buildings such as the sixteenth-century house in front of Matriz Church — the main church, the old Town Hall (14th century), the seventeenth century Solar dos Carneiros and house of Captain Leite Ferreira, and the eighteenth century Limas and the Coentrão Houses.

Unlike the overlap in Lake George, this concurrency lasts for only three blocks before the two routes split.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is olive-brown. Spores are {{somewhat}} fuse-shaped in face view, and inequilateral in profile view. They have a smooth surface, a tiny apical pore, and dimensions of 11–15 by 4–5.5μm, with walls about 0.2μm thick. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 8–12μm thick. Pleurocystidia (on the tube walls) are 28–42 by 6–11μm with a 3–μm neck, whereas the cheilocystidia (on the pore edges) are narrowly club-shaped and slightly smaller, measuring 26–38 by 4–8μm. Pleurocystidia tend to not protrude further than sporulating basidia. The cap cuticle comprises a 150μm-thick layer <b>of</b> <b>narrow</b> hyphae measuring 3–5μm {{more or less}} arranged in a trichodermium (wherein the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface).

5|$|Up {{to the end}} of the 18th century, slate was {{extracted}} on a {{small scale}} by groups of quarrymen who paid a royalty to the landlord, carted slate to the ports, and then shipped it to England, Ireland and sometimes France.

5|$|Because the {{architecture}} of English cathedrals is so diverse and inventive, the internal appearances differ a great deal. However, in general, English cathedral interiors tend to give an impression of length. This is in part {{because many of the}} buildings are actually very long, but also because more than in the medieval architecture of any other country, the horizontal direction is given as much visual emphasis as the vertical. This is particularly the case at Wells where, unlike most Gothic buildings, there are no vertical shafts that continue from the arcade to the vault and there is a very strong emphasis on the triforium gallery with its seemingly endless and undifferentiated row <b>of</b> <b>narrow</b> arches. Salisbury has a similar lack of verticals while the course below the triforium and the undecorated capitals of Purbeck stone create strong visual horizontals. In the cases of Winchester, Norwich and Exeter the horizontal effect is created by the emphasis on the ridge rib of the elaborate vaults.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the rings}} of Uranus {{appear to be}} young, they must be {{continuously}} renewed by the collisional fragmentation of larger bodies. The estimates show that the lifetime against collisional disruption of a moon with the size like that of Puck is a few billion years. The lifetime of a smaller satellite is much shorter. Therefore, all current inner moons and rings can be products of disruption of several Puck-sized satellites during the last four and half billion years. Every such disruption would have started a collisional cascade that quickly ground almost all large bodies into much smaller particles, including dust. Eventually the majority of mass was lost, and particles survived only in positions that were stabilized by mutual resonances and shepherding. The end product of such a disruptive evolution would be a system <b>of</b> <b>narrow</b> rings. However, a few moonlets must still be embedded within the rings at present. The maximum size of such moonlets is probably around 10km.|$|E
5|$|The {{definitive}} {{discovery of}} the Uranian rings was made by astronomers James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Jessica Mink on March 10, 1977, using the Kuiper Airborne Observatory, and was serendipitous. They planned to use the occultation of the star SAO 158687 by Uranus to study the planet's atmosphere. However, when their observations were analyzed, {{they found that the}} star disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it was eclipsed by the planet. They deduced that a system <b>of</b> <b>narrow</b> rings was present. The five occultation events they observed were denoted by the Greek letters α, β, γ, δ and ε in their papers. These designations have been used as the rings' names since then. Later they found four additional rings: one between the β and γ rings and three inside the α ring. The former was named the η ring. The latter were dubbed rings 4, 5 and 6—according to the numbering of the occultation events in one paper. Uranus's ring system was the second to be discovered in the Solar System, after that of Saturn.|$|E
5|$|The {{golden jackal}} often hunts alone, and {{sometimes}} in pairs, but rarely hunts in a pack. When hunting alone, it trots around an area and occasionally stops to sniff and listen. Once prey is located, the jackal conceals itself, quickly approaches its prey and then pounces on it. Single jackals hunt rodents, hares, and birds. They hunt rodents in grass by locating them with their hearing before leaping {{into the air and}} pouncing on them. In India, they can dig Indian gerbils out from their burrows, and they can hunt young, old, and infirm ungulates up to 4–5 times their body weight. Jackals search for hiding blackbuck calves throughout the day during the calving period. The peak times for their searches are the early morning and the late evening. When hunting in pairs or packs, jackals run parallel to their prey and overtake it in unison. When hunting aquatic rodents or birds, they will run along both sides <b>of</b> <b>narrow</b> rivers or streams and drive their prey from one jackal to another.|$|E
