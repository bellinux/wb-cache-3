5|$|Botanists {{study how}} plants produce food {{and how to}} {{increase}} yields, for example through plant breeding, making their work important to mankind's ability to feed the world and provide food security for future generations. Botanists also study weeds, which are a considerable problem in agriculture, and the biology and control of plant pathogens in agriculture and natural ecosystems. Ethnobotany is the study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> plants and people. When applied to the investigation of historical plant–people relationships ethnobotany may {{be referred to as}} archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany. Some of the earliest plant-people relationships arose between the indigenous people of Canada in identifying edible plants from inedible plants. This relationship the indigenous people had with plants was recorded by ethnobotanists.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} story, Nagisa is {{introduced}} {{to other students}} {{from each of the}} three schools; some she admires, some she is intimidated by, and some are merely friends encountered while attending St. Miator. The series encompasses the relationships the characters build with each other, climaxing whenever two of the characters start dating. The central focuses of Strawberry Panic! are the lesbian relationships and friendships between the girls from the three schools and the Etoile position and competition; the anime is more relationship-heavy while the manga is more competition-heavy. The story of what happens to the other half of St. Miator's Etoile pairing is explored in the latter portion of the anime. Depending on the media type, the depiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> the girls is variously presented, with more explicit fan service– appealing visuals of the girls in provocative situations– in the anime adaptation than in the manga or light novels. A hint of astronomical star imagery is seen throughout the series, as well as minor Catholic religious undertones including a St. Mary statue on campus and a large Catholic church in the center of Astraea Hill.|$|E
5|$|The marsh shrew and the American {{water shrew}} (Sorex pallustris) share many {{physical}} characteristics. The former {{is found in}} a narrower area from the northwest coast to the lower slopes of the inland mountains. The American water shrew is more widely distributed across the western mountains and through the subarctic regions of Canada and the eastern U.S. The species' ranges are primarily allopatric; although they may overlap (sympatry) in coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, differences in elevation tend to separate them. Early taxonomists placed these mammals into separate subgenera; Merriam assigned the marsh shrew to Atophyrax, and Jackson (1928) assigned the Pacific water shrew to Neosorex. A closer, dentition-based relationship was assigned by Findley (1955), with both species assigned to the subgenus Otisorex. Findley hypothesized {{that in the early}} Pleistocene, the ancestors of masked and vagrant shrews (Sorex cinereus and Sorex vagrans, respectively) diverged; during the Yarmouth interglacial, the American water shrew and marsh shrew diverged from their vagrant-shrew ancestors. Three other Sorex species evolved during the Sangamonian: the dwarf shrew (S. nanus), the southeastern shrew (Sorex longirostris) and the ornate shrew (Sorex ornatus). Findley's assignment of the marsh shrew and the American water shrew to Otisorex was later reinforced by biochemical and genetic studies. In 2005, findings were published (based on mitochondrial DNA analysis) which better defined the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> marsh shrews, Pacific water shrews and their respective subspecies. Variations in the sequencing of cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA were assessed, and the results of the 2005 phylogeny for the marsh shrew are shown below in detail.|$|E
