5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong, the {{respondent}} challenged his conviction for corruption {{on the ground}} that section 37 of the Prevention <b>of</b> <b>Corruption</b> Act, which extends the effect of the Act to corrupt acts by Singapore citizens (but not non-citizens) occurring outside Singapore, discriminated against citizens and thus violated Article 12(1). The Court of Appeal held that the distinction drawn by the section 37 between citizens and non-citizens who are abroad is valid as it is a reasonable means of achieving the Act's object, which is to address acts <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> taking place outside Singapore but affecting events within it. The exclusion of non-citizens from the ambit of section 37 observes international comity and the sovereignty of other nations.|$|E
5|$|An {{economic}} crisis took {{effect in the}} mid-1980s to late 1990s {{as a result of}} international economic conditions, drought, falling petroleum prices, and years <b>of</b> <b>corruption,</b> mismanagement, and cronyism.

With the reintroduction of multi-party politics in December 1990, the former British Southern Cameroons pressure groups called for greater autonomy, and the Southern Cameroons National Council advocated complete secession as the Republic of Ambazonia.|$|E

5|$|As in {{many other}} African societies, prebendalism and high rates <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> {{continue}} to constitute major challenges to Nigeria. All major parties have practised vote rigging and other means of coercion to remain competitive. In 1983, the policy institute at Kuru concluded that only the 1959 and 1979 elections to that time were conducted with minimal vote rigging. In 2012, Nigeria was estimated to have lost over $400 billion to corruption since independence.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} cooperative tasks, multi-robot systems {{are required to}} communicate among each other. Thus, maintaining the connectivity of the communication graph is a fundamental issue. In this paper we develop a strategy based on Sabattini et al., Decentralized Connectivity Maintenance for Networked Lagrangian Dynamical Systems, 2012 for guaranteeing connectivity in the presence <b>of</b> data <b>corruption.</b> In fact, when dealing with real systems, several sources <b>of</b> data <b>corruption</b> can appear. For instance, sensor noise {{is one of the}} primary sources <b>of</b> data <b>corruption.</b> Moreover, when dealing with interconnected robotic systems, assuming instantaneous exchange of data is often unrealistic: com- munication delays are then another important source <b>of</b> data <b>corruption.</b> For this reason, we provide a solution to the connectivity maintenance problem for interconnected Lagrangian dynamical agents, in the presence <b>of</b> data <b>corruption...</b>|$|R

He {{was the only}} deputy of the Belarusian {{parliament}} who voted against ratification of the December 1991 agreement that dissolved the Soviet Union {{and set up the}} Commonwealth of Independent States. Having acquired a reputation as an eloquent opponent <b>of</b> <b>corruption,</b> Lukashenko was elected in April 1993 to serve as the interim chairman of the anti-corruption committee of the Belarusian parliament. In late 1993 he accused 70 senior government officials, including the Supreme Soviet chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and prime minister Vyacheslav Kebich, <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> including stealing state funds for personal purposes. While the charges were never fully proven against him, Shushkevich resigned his chairmanship due to the embarrassment of the series of events and losing a vote of no-confidence. He served in that position until July 1994.|$|E
