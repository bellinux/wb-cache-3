25|$|The Singapore Police Force {{receives}} the highest budget allocation annually {{as compared to}} the various departments of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), typically accounting for about 50% of its annual budget. For the fiscal year of 2013 (for the year beginning 1 April 2013), S$3.89 billion was budgeted to the MHA, of which 47.8%, or S$1.86 billion was allocated for the Police Programme. Actual expenses in the 2013 fiscal year was S$2.04 billion, of which S$1.88 billion was spent on <b>operating</b> <b>expenditure</b> (against the budgeted S$1.79 billion) and S$159.1 million on development expenditure (budgeted at $71.83 million). Manpower costs amounting to S$1.16 billion continue to dominate the SPF's expenditure, accounting for 61.7% of its <b>operating</b> <b>expenditure</b> and 56.9% of total expenditure in FY2013.|$|E

This includes S$2.26 billion for <b>Operating</b> <b>Expenditure</b> and $210.93 million for Development Expenditure.

Weak central banks typically (although not exclusively) operate in smaller and less wealthy countries, lack independence from their governments, and are burdened by compulsory transfers and low capital. Their <b>operating</b> <b>expenditures,</b> nonperforming assets, international reserve carrying costs, and international reserve accumulation needs are high.

5000|$|Although details vary across regimes, {{the most}} common {{approach}} to creating incentives to reduce expenditure {{is to use a}} regulatory period consisting of many years. The allowed revenue is set once {{at the beginning of the}} regulatory period and there is no clawback of over-spend or under-spend at the end of the regulatory period - thereby allowing the regulated firm to keep some or all of the cost savings it makes during the regulatory period. The <b>operating</b> <b>expenditure</b> input to the building block model is usually based closely on the observed <b>operating</b> <b>expenditure</b> at the end of the previous regulatory period. This approach ensures reasonably strong incentives to reduce <b>operating</b> <b>expenditure</b> in the early years of a regulatory period but can, in principle, lead to weak incentives to reduce <b>operating</b> <b>expenditure</b> in the later years of a regulatory period. One way to solve this problem is to base the <b>operating</b> <b>expenditure</b> not just on a single [...] "test year" [...] of the previous regulatory period but on the average of the previous years. In practice this problem is, instead, often addressed with some form of [...] "efficiency carry-over" [...] or [...] "efficiency benefit sharing" [...] scheme.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{issues of}} equality and efficiency in two different school funding systems- a state-level system in Michigan and a foundation system in Ohio. Unlike Ohio, the Michigan system restricts districts from generating property or income tax revenue to fund <b>operating</b> <b>expenditures.</b> In both states, districts fund capital expenditures with local tax revenue. Our results indicate that although average revenue and expenditures per pupil in Michigan and Ohio are almost identical, the distributions of the various revenue sources are quite different. Ohio’s funding system has greater equality in terms of total revenue, largely due to Ohio redistributing state funds to the least wealthy districts while Michigan does not. We find that relatively wealthy Michigan districts spend more on capital expenditures while relatively wealthy Ohio districts spend more on labor and materials. This suggests that constraints on raising local revenue to fund <b>operating</b> <b>expenditures</b> in Michigan could create efficiency issues...|$|R
