At Tetrem, various experiments with different machinery for crushing and grinding the <b>ore</b> in <b>preparation</b> for gravity separation (sluicing) were carried out {{and the results are}} presented. The trials led to the construction and application of suitable, locally obtainable equipment for such milling operations. Continuous weighing and sample checks at the different stages of the comminution and gravity separation provided interesting production and recovery data which could be of help for similar operations. Trials for improved recovery of gold from sulphidic ores were carried out and showed the restrictions of gravity separation when confronted with such „fresh ores“. The amalgamation process, recirculation of tailings, special handling of tailings for recovery improvements are described. An overview about the results obtained during six months of operation is presented. Improvements for the locally produced machines and problems with maintenance and repairs of the equipment as well as strategies to solve them are discussed. The experiences obtained in the marketing of the final gold product are critically outlined...|$|R

50|$|The Orbite {{process is}} divided in four steps: {{aluminum}} <b>ore</b> <b>preparation,</b> leaching, extraction of alumina, extraction {{of iron and}} calcination. First, the raw material is reduced into fine particles to increase the contact surface. Doing so maximize {{the effect of the}} acid leaching which is the next step. The acid leaching then occurs at very high temperature using hydrochloric acid. At the end of the leaching all metal molecules (excluding titanium) react to produce chloride compounds. Specifically, iron molecules form ferric chloride (FeCl3) and alumina molecule form aluminum trichloride (AlCl3). Silica is then removed by simple filtration becoming the main leftover of the process. Afterward, the aluminum trichloride is removed by precipitation. The step of the high temperature calcination transforms it into alumina. The leachate still containing FeCl3 is hydrolysed at low temperature, producing ferric oxide and regenerating the hydrochloric acid. Rare earth and other metals can then be extracted using common process.|$|E

40|$|The general {{population}} may {{be exposed to}} tungsten in ambient air and food. Tungsten carbide is {{the most frequently used}} tungsten compound. It is used in cutting tools, mining and drilling tools, forming and drawing dies, and several other wear-resistant applications. Occupational Populations Occupational exposure to tungsten and its compounds occurs during the production of tungsten metal from the <b>ore</b> and <b>preparation</b> of tungsten carbide powders. Exposure to cemented tungsten carbide can occur during the manufacturing and grinding of cemented tungsten carbide hard metal parts. Workers can also be exposed to dusts and mists of tungsten and its compounds or cemented tungsten carbide during crushing, mixing, ball milling, loading and unloading, and grinding operations. Toxicokinetics In dogs, about 60 % of inhaled tungsten was retained in the lungs and 33 % of that was absorbed through the lungs. The remaining tungsten was cleared to the gastrointestinal tract via the mucociliary escalator system. Approximately 55 – 92 % of ingested tungsten is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, with humans being near the low end. Once absorbed, tungsten is distributed throughout the body with the highest concentrations initially in the bone and kidneys, with long term retention mainly in bone. Tungsten is not metabolized, and absorbed tungsten is eliminated mainly via the urine. Most absorbed tungsten is eliminated several days after exposure; however, tungsten stored in bone is slowly released and excreted. Normal Human Levels Tungsten blood and urine levels of 1 – 6 µg/L and 0. 085 µg/L, respectively, have been measured in the {{general population}}. Biomarkers Blood and fecal tungsten levels are the most useful biomarkers of tungsten exposure. Urine and saliva may also be used to provide information on exposure...|$|R

40|$|Due to low {{availability}} of coking coal and huge establishment cost of Blast Furnace plants, the predominant route of Iron making has meandered {{away from this}} conventional route to a modern route of Iron making. This route involves production of Directly Reduced Iron (DRI) using non-coking coal and gases as the reducing agent. The commercial name of DRI is Sponge Iron owing to its spongy appearance since the ore is reduced in solid rather than liquid state. Since DRI can work with low quality non-coking coal, it makes the best possible usage of cheap coal available in India. High {{availability of}} low- quality and iron-ore and coal, the low establishment cost of DRI plants has over the years attracted multitude of opportunist to earn a fortune in this sector. India is the leading producer of sponge iron in world, producing nearly about 30 % of the total DRI world production.

5000|$|In industry, crushers are {{machines}} {{which use}} a metal surface to break or compress materials into small fractional chunks or denser masses. Throughout most of industrial history, {{the greater part}} of crushing and mining part of the process occurred under muscle power as the application of force concentrated in the tip of the miners pick or sledge hammer driven drill bit. Before explosives came into widespread use in bulk mining in the mid-nineteenth century, most initial ore crushing and sizing was by hand and hammers at the mine or by water powered trip hammers in the small charcoal fired smithies and iron works typical of the Renaissance through the early-to-middle industrial revolution. It was only after explosives, and later early powerful steam shovels produced large chunks of materials, chunks originally reduced by hammering in the mine before being loaded into sacks for a trip to the surface, chunks that were eventually also to lead to rails and mine railways transporting bulk aggregations that post-mine face crushing became widely necessary. The earliest of these were in the foundries, but as coal took hold the larger operations became the coal breakers that fueled industrial growth from {{the first decade of the}} 1600s to the replacement of breakers in the 1970s through the fuel needs of the present day. The gradual coming of that era and displacement of the cottage industry based economies was itself accelerated first by the utility of wrought and cast iron as a desired materials giving impetus to larger operations, then in the late-sixteenth century by the increasing scarcity of wood lands for charcoal production to make the newfangled window glass material that had become - along with the chimney - [...] 'all the rage' [...] among the growing middle-class and affluence of the sixteenth-and-seventeenth centuries;and as always, the charcoal needed to smelt metals, especially to produce ever larger amounts of brass and bronze, pig iron, cast iron and wrought iron demanded by the new consumer classes. Other metallurgical developments such as silver and gold mining mirrored the practices and developments of the bulk material handling methods and technologies feeding the burgeoning appetite for more and more iron and glass, both of which were rare in personal possessions until the 1700s. [...] Things only became worse when the English figured out how to cast the more economical iron cannons (1547), following on their feat of becoming the armorers of the European continent's powers by having been leading producers brass and bronze guns, and eventually by various acts of Parliament, gradually banned or restricted the further cutting of trees for charcoal in larger and larger regions in the United Kingdom. In 1611, a consortium led by courtier Edward Zouch was granted a patent for the reverberatory furnace, a furnace using coal, not precious national timber reserves, which was immediately employed in glass making. An early politically connected and wealthy Robber Baron figure Sir Robert Mansell bought his way into the fledgling furnace company wrested control of it, and by 1615 managed to have James I issued a proclamation forbidding the use of wood to produce glass, giving his families extensive coal holdings a monopoly on both source and means of production for nearly half-a-century. Abraham Darby a century later relocated to Bristol where he had established a building brass and bronze industry by importing Dutch workers and using them to raid Dutch techniques. Both materials were considered superior to iron for cannon, and machines as they were better understood. But Darby would change the world in several key ways. Where the Dutch had failed in casting iron, one of Darby's apprentices, John Thomas succeeded in 1707 and as Burke put it: [...] "had given England the key to the Industrial Revolution". At the time, mines and foundries were virtually all small enterprises except for the tin mines (driven by the price and utility of brass) and materials came out of the mines already hammered small by legions of miners who had to stuff their work into carry sacks for pack animal slinging. Concurrently, mines needed drained resulting in Savery and Newcomen's early steam driven pumping systems. The deeper the mines went, the larger the demand became for better pumps, the greater the demand for iron, the greater the need for coal, the greater the demand for each. Seeing ahead clearly, Darby, sold off his brass business interests and relocated to Coalbrookdale with its plentiful coal mines, water power and nearby ore supplies. Over that decade his foundries developed iron casting technologies and began to supplant other metals in many applications. He adapted Coking of his fuel by copying Brewers practices. In 1822 the pumping industries needs for larger cylinders met up with Darby's ability to melt sufficient quantities of pig iron to cast large inexpensive iron cylinders instead of costly brass ones, reducing the cost of cylinders by nine-tenths. [...] With gunpowder being increasingly applied to mining, rock chunks from a mining face became much larger, and the blast dependent mining itself had become dependent upon an organized group, not just an individual swinging a pick. Economies of scale gradually infused industrial enterprises, while transport became a key bottleneck as the volume of moved materials continued to increase following demand. This spurred numerous canal projects, inspired laying first wooden, then iron protected rails using draft animals to pull loads in the emerging bulk goods transportation dependent economy.

40|$|Introduction. The Lena gold {{province}} {{is one of}} {{the largest}} known gold resources in the world. The history of its exploration is long, but the genesis of gold mineralization hosted in black shales in the Bodaibo synclinorium still remains unclear. The studies face the challenge of discovering sources for the useful component and mechanisms of its redistribution and concentration. This study aims to clarify the time sequence of the ore mineralization in the Chertovo Koryto deposit on the basis of detailed mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of the ore, wallrock metasomatites and the Early Proterozoic host black shales, and to assess the applicability of the Sukhoi Log model for clarifying the Chertovo Koryto origin. Geological setting. The Lena gold province is located in the junction area of the Siberian platform and the Baikal mountain region (Fig. 1). The main element of its geological structure is the Chuya-Tonoda-Nechera anticline. Its axial segment is marked by horsts composed of the Early Proterozoic rocks with abundant granitoid massifs. The Chertovo Koryto deposit is located within the Kevakta ore complex at the Tonoda uplift, the largest tectonically disturbed block between the Kevakta and Amandrak granitoids massifs. The 150 m thick and 1. 5 km long ore zone of the Chertovo Koryto deposit is confined to the hanging wall of the fold-fault zone feathering the Amandrak deep fault (Fig. 2). Composition. In the ore zone, rocks of the Mikhailovsk Formation include carbonaceous shales of the feldspar-chlorite-sericite-quartz composition with nest-shaped ore accumulations of the pyrite-quartz composition and quartz veinlets. In our study, we distinguish five mineral associations resulting from heterochronous processes that sequentially replaced each other: - The earliest association related with the quartz-muscovite-sericite metasomatism and the removal of REE and other elements from the rocks and their partial redeposition; - Metamorphic sulphidization presented by scattered impregnations of pyrrhotite, as evidenced by small lenses of pyrrhotite, which are considerably elongated (axes up to 0. 7 cm long) along the foliation planes (Figs 3, a, b); - Ore mineralization represented by a superimposed hydrothermal gold association with arsenopyrite (Fig. 3, d); - Late chalcophilic mineralization formed at the final stage of hydrothermal-metasomatic process (Figs 3, e, f); - Post-ore silification. Geochemical characteristics. The geochemical study of rocks and ores from the Chertovo Koryto deposit show that the rocks of the Mikhailovsk Formation are characterized by higher contents of rock-forming elements, such as of Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3 total, MgO, K 2 O, and P 2 O 5, in comparison to the PAAS standards [Condie, 1993] and the black shale standard composition (SChS- 1) [Petrov et al., 2004]. A characteristic feature of the ore zone is that the contents of practically all the oxides, except SiO 2, tend to decrease (Table 1). The distribution of rare elements repeats the pattern established for major elements. The least metamorphosed rocks of the Mikhailovsk Formation have higher contents (up to three times) of Cu, Mo, Ba, W, As, Pb relative to the values in the PAAS and SChS- 1 standards. In the ore zone, the contents of almost all rare elements are considerably reduced (Table 2). The contents of elements in the siderophile group (Co, Ni) are clearly correlated with the ore processes and increased more than twice in the area of metamorphic changes. Samples with gold-ore grade contents show the highest concentrations of Co and Ni. Conclusion. In our opinion, the Chertovo Koryto deposit was formed in five stages, the first two of which were pre-ore, with <b>ore</b> <b>preparation,</b> and probably considerably distant in time from the main ore-generating event. The staged formation of the Chertovo Koryto deposit correlates with the basic stages in the tectono-metamorphic history of the study region and is consistent with the model showing the formation of Sukhoi Log-type deposits [Nemerov, 1989; Buryak, Khmelevskaya, 1997; Large et al., 2007].  </p...|$|E
