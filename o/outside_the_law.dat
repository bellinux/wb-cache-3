5|$|As {{a result}} of this and similar controversies, Alf Dubs {{introduced}} a private member's bill named the Solicitors (Independent Complaints Procedure) Bill on 12 February 1985, which would move the responsibility of regulating the solicitors profession to a body <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> Society. Professional opinion was split on this – the National Consumer Council, Legal Action Group and many of the smaller law societies supported the proposal, while larger law societies and the Law Society of England and Wales opposed it.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{stories to}} Si Ronda's include those of Si Jampang and Si Pitung; these stage plays centred on {{extraordinary}} men (referred to as jago) who, though living <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> generally {{fought for the}} common populace. Adaptations of the genre, manifested as bandit films, became popular in domestic cinema following the release of Si Tjonat by Batavia Motion Picture in 1929. This release {{was followed by the}} Wong brothers' Rampok Preanger (also 1929), and an adaptation of the Si Pitung stories in 1931. Not all films in this genre, which consisted of a quarter of all domestic releases for 1929–1931, maintained the heroic qualities of the central character: the Wongs' adaptation of Si Pitung, for instance, portrayed him as a simple bandit and not the Robin Hood figure of stage.|$|E

25|$|During Mississippi's {{extended}} Prohibition period, {{from the}} 1920s until the 1960s, illegal drinking and gambling casinos flourished {{on the east}} side of the Pearl River, in Flowood along the original U.S. Route 80 just across from the city of Jackson. Those illegal casinos, bootleg liquor stores, and nightclubs made up the Gold Coast, a strip of mostly black-market businesses that operated for decades along Flowood Road. Although <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> the Gold Coast was a thriving center of nightlife and music, with many local blues musicians appearing regularly in the clubs.|$|E

After pressure from the Law Society and several of the larger regional societies, the reforms were toned down, and the final proposal (which was implemented on 31 August 1986) kept the responsibility of regulating the solicitors' profession within the Law Society but increased the separation of functions within the Society and required {{that the majority of the}} people on regulatory committees be lay people (not solicitors).|$|E
25|$|Late on November 30, 1957, in Lincoln, Starkweather became {{angry at}} service station {{attendant}} Robert Colvert {{for refusing to}} sell him a stuffed animal on credit. He returned {{several times during the}} night to purchase small items, then finally, brandishing a shotgun, forced Colvert to hand over $100, then drove him to a remote area. After Colvert was injured during a struggle over the gun, Starkweather killed him with a shot to the head. He immediately confessed to Fugate that he had only robbed Colvert but that someone else had killed him. Fugate later told police that she did not believe Starkweather's story, but pretended to go along out of fear. Starkweather later claimed that after this first murder, he believed he had transcended his former self, reaching a new plane of existence in which he was <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and could commit any crime without guilt or fear of repercussion.|$|E
25|$|Garrison also {{remained}} {{active in}} areas <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> after the 1945. From 1947 to 1952 {{he served as}} President of the National Urban League. He {{was a close friend}} of Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson, and strongly supported Stevenson's campaigns for President of the United States in 1952 and 1956. From 1958 to 1961, Garrison worked closely with Eleanor Roosevelt, Thomas Finletter, and Herbert H. Lehman to break the power of Tammany Hall-backed politician Carmine DeSapio in New York City politics. The efforts of Garrison and the other finally broke Tammany Hall's grip on the city for good: Ed Koch defeated De Sapio by 41 votes in 1963 and by 164 votes in a rematch in 1964, and De Sapio's political career ended. Garrison was a long-time member of the American Civil Liberties Union, and served on its board of directors from the late 1930s until at least 1965. Over the years, he was {{also a member of the}} board of trustees for Harvard University, Sarah Lawrence College, and Howard University. While serving on the Howard board, he helped write a report which significantly restructured the school's administrative procedures. He was also a long-time member of the Council of Foreign Relations and the New York City Bar Association.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{overseas}} re-makes {{have also been}} produced. A Dutch version aired for one series in 1995, entitled Wat schuift't? (What's it worth?). The Trotters were renamed the Aarsmans and it starred Johnny Kraaykamp jnr. as Stef (Del), Sacco Van der Made as Grandad and Kasper van Kooten as Robbie (Rodney), and was shown on RTL 4. A Portuguese re-make, O Fura-Vidas, a local expression for someone who lives <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> ran for three series from 1999 to 2001. It was a literal translation of the British version, with all episodes based on the originals. It centred on the Fintas family, who live in Sapadores, a neighbourhood in Lisbon, and starred Miguel Guilherme as Quim (Del), Canto e Castro as Grandad, and Ivo Canelas as Joca (Rodney). In this Portuguese version the Reliant's equivalent was a 1988 Suzuki Super Carry. A Slovenian re-make, called Brat bratu (Brother to Brother), was broadcast from 2008 to 2009. All episodes {{were based on the}} original British storylines, and it was made in co-operation with John Sullivan. It featured brothers Brane (Brane Šturbej) and Bine (Jure Drevenšek), who moved from Maribor to Ljubljana. The series also stars Peter Ternovšek as Grandad. It was directed by Branko Đurić. The series was cancelled after thirteen episodes due to poor ratings.|$|E
25|$|Marginalized in the {{legitimate}} economy, {{a small group}} of blacks found success <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> running gambling on numbers. Invented in 1920 or 1921, numbers had exploded by 1924 into a racket turning over {{tens of millions of dollars}} every year. That year the New York Age reported that there were at least thirty bankers (the name given to someone running a numbers game) in Harlem, with many employing between twelve and twenty people to collect bets, and Marcellino, the largest banker, employing over one hundred. By the late 1920s, Wallace Thurman guessed there were over a thousand collectors taking bets from 100,000 clients a day. The most successful bankers, who could earn enormous sums of money, were known as Kings and Queens. The wealthiest numbers king of all was almost certainly the reputed inventor of the game, Casper Holstein. He owned a fleet of cars, apartment buildings in Harlem and a home on Long Island, but did not have the ostentatious style and lifestyle of many other kings. He, and other bankers, gave money to charities and loans to aspiring businessmen and needy residents. Holstein's role in the community extended further than most of his colleagues, included membership in the Monarch Lodge of the Elks, support for Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association, philanthropy in his native Virgin Islands, and patronage of the Harlem Renaissance.|$|E
500|$|This song, {{described}} as [...] "up-tempo blues shuffle, pure Memphis" [...] and {{an example of}} [...] "obvious pop sensibility and compulsive melody", was recorded in four takes on March 7, 1966. Gill sees the lyrics {{as a series of}} sexual metaphors, including [...] "beating on my trumpet" [...] and keys to locked gates, many deriving from traditional blues.

500|$|Examples in the {{historical}} European folk tradition where criminals have been declared to be outside {{of the law and}} banished from the community are illustrated. Duerr connects these outsiders to executioners and warriors who were also <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> because they had entered the world of the dead. [...] Similarly, the witches of the early modern period also left the everyday world, and like the shamans of Siberia experienced their [...] "wild" [...] or [...] "animal aspect" [...] in order to understand their human side. [...] Duerr uses ethnographic examples {{from around the world to}} show that many cultures have used hallucinogenic substances to reach states of consciousness beyond ordinary societal boundaries.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Minutemen," [...] {{a team of}} costumed crime fighters, {{was formed}} in 1939 in {{response}} to a rise in costumed gangs and criminals; the [...] "Watchmen" [...] team was similarly formed decades later. Their existence has dramatically affected world events: Doctor Manhattan's powers have helped the United States win the Vietnam War, and given the West a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union, which by 1985 threatens to escalate the Cold War into a nuclear war. Additionally, the Comedian has suppressed evidence of the Watergate scandal, allowing President Richard Nixon to repeal the 22nd Amendment and be elected for multiple terms. Growing anti-vigilante sentiment leads to masked crime-fighters being outlawed. While many of the heroes retire, Dr Manhattan and The Comedian operate as government-sanctioned agents, and Rorschach continues to operate <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
500|$|When {{the identities}} of the Butcher's victims are {{revealed}} to be murderers, the public applauds him, elevating Dexter to the status of a folktale avenger or comic-book anti-hero. And indeed Rita excoriates him for disappearing at night [...] "like Clark fucking Kent," [...] but the FBI describes the Butcher as more like one's own [...] "personal Batman." [...] Batman is an apt comparison, although Dexter prefers to violate Batman's aversion to killing. Both live <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> [...] "part human, part mutant," [...] as Dexter puts it. Both cling to an ethos riddled with perplexities and contradictions. Visiting a comic-book shop, Dexter find himself transformed on a handmade superhero poster from Butcher into The Dark Defender, a protector {{of the city and the}} executioner of its predators. Vigilantes simultaneously share territory with cops and outlaws, they break the law in the hopes of helping society. ...

500|$|Revolution, {{published}} a year later, told of how Hester Hyman's sacrifice had inspired millions to demonstrate for democracy. Political campaign groups, including Hester's husband Gort Hyman, organised a massive protest march {{through the streets}} which would end at the Grand Hall of Justice. Chief Judge Silver {{did not want to}} ban the [...] "Democratic March" [...] outright, as such overt action would only play into the Democrats' hands. Instead he ordered Dredd to undermine the March by covert action. When Dredd asked if his orders included breaking the law, Silver replied: [...] "on this one you write the law." [...] This moment was itself {{a turning point in the}} history of the strip, as a fundamental feature of Dredd's character had always been his utmost regard for, and obedience to, the law. His subsequent actions within the strip can be explained if Silver is regarded as invoking the fictional Security of the City Act, which had been mentioned in earlier stories and which allows judges to act <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> if necessary to protect national security. Nevertheless, later stories would depict Dredd's profound regret for the actions he took to thwart the March, and his disillusionment with the Judge System would have very significant consequences for the strip.|$|E
500|$|Watchmen {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} reality that closely mirrors the contemporary world of the 1980s. The primary difference {{is the presence of}} superheroes. The point of divergence occurs in the year 1938. Their existence in this version of America is shown to have dramatically affected and altered the outcomes of real-world events such as the Vietnam War and the presidency of Richard Nixon. In keeping with the realism of the series, although the costumed crimefighters of Watchmen are commonly called [...] "superheroes", only one (Doctor Manhattan) possesses any superhuman powers. The war in Vietnam ends with a U.S. victory in 1971 and Nixon is still president as of October 1985. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan occurs approximately six years later than in real life. When the story begins, the existence of Doctor Manhattan has given the U.S. a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union, which has increased tensions between the two nations. Eventually, superheroes grow unpopular among the police and the public, leading to the passage of legislation (the Keene Act) in 1977 to outlaw them. While many of the heroes retired, Doctor Manhattan and a veteran superhero known as The Comedian operate as government-sanctioned agents. Another, Rorschach, continues to operate <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
500|$|On 17 May 1636, Hale {{was called}} to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn, and {{immediately}} became the pupil of William Noy.

Selden persuaded him to continue with his studies <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> and much of Hale's written work is concerned with theology and science as well as legal theory. Hale gained a good legal practise, although he allowed his Christian faith to govern his work. He sought to help the court reach a just verdict, whatever his client's concerns, and normally returned half his fee or charged a standard fee of 10 shillings rather than allow costs to inflate. He refused to accept unjust cases, and always tried to be on the [...] "right" [...] side of any case; John Campbell wrote that [...] "If he saw that a cause was unjust, he for a great while would not meddle further in it but to give his advice that it was so; if the parties after that would go on, they were to seek another counsellor, for he would assist none in acts of injustice".|$|E
