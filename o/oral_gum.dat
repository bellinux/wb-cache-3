40|$|Background and objectives: Baneh tree or Pistacia atlantica subsp. kurdica is an endemic plant of Iran which {{belongs to}} Anacardiaceae family. It has various {{traditional}} uses including astringent and anti-diarrheal {{as well as}} improving some of the symptoms of gastrointestinal upsets. In this study we decided to investigate the effects of various fractions of baneh gum with different doses in an animal model of ulcerative colitis {{as one of the}} important chronic inflammatory bowel diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Methods: The volatile oil and aqueous baneh gum suspensions were prepared and the constituents of the volatile oil were analyzed by GC/MS. They were used to treat colitis induced by acetic acid 4 % in rats. Three doses of gum (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) were administered both orally (p. o.) and intra-rectally (i. r.) while volatile oil was administered p. o. with doses 100, 200 and 400 µl/kg for four constitutive days. Anti-inflammatory effects of the test compounds were compared with oral prednisolone and hydrocortisone enema. Wet colon weight/ length ratio and tissue damage scores and area as well as indices of colitis and tissue myeloperoxidase activity were evaluated for each specimen. Results: Alpha-pinene was the main constituent of baneh volatile oil (41. 23 %). We observed therapeutic effects in applied doses of <b>oral</b> <b>gum</b> as well as volatile oil to reduce all indices of colitis and myeloperoxidase activity. Unlike the oral form of gum, its rectal administration was not significantly effective to improve colitis. Conclusion: This research has proved the anti-inflammatory potential of <b>oral</b> <b>gum</b> of Pistacia atlantica subsp. kurdica and its volatile oil in an experimentally induced colitis...|$|E

Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of sesame oil and lignans isolated from sesame oil on oral microorganisms and to check whether saponification or emulsification occurs during oil-pulling therapy. Materials and Methods: The in vitro study was carried out in three different phases: (1) Antibacterial activity of the lignans and sesame oil were tested by minimum inhibitory concentration assay by agar dilution method and agar well diffusion method, respectively. (2) Increase in free fatty acid level of oil and the quantity of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) used up in the titration are good indicators of saponification process. This was assessed using analytical tests for vegetable oils. (3) Swished oil was observed under light microscope to assess the status of the oil, presence of microorganisms, oral debris and foreign bodies. Results: Sesamin and sesamolin isolated from sesame oil did not have any antibacterial effect against oral microorganisms like Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus viridans. Emulsification of sesame oil occurs during oil-pulling therapy. Increased consumption of NaOH in titration is a definite indication of a possible saponification process.

The treatment continued until the fifteenth day after delivery, after which mothers were switched to plain tap water. A number of tests were carried out on offspring starting one day after birth and extending up to postnatal day 30 (PD 30). Pups showed a reduced gain of body weight and delayed opening of the eyes in comparison to the control group and only pups exposed to 1 g/kg body weight GA had a faster appearance of hair. Sensory motor reflex tests carried out during the weaning period (from day of birth to PD 21) showed enhanced motor reflexes in pups exposed to GA. During the adolescent period (from PD 22 to PD 30), offspring showed dose-dependent enhanced motor activity (on PD 22), reduced anxiety and fear (on PD 27) and slightly enhanced memory and learning abilities (on PD 30).

Eligible patients were randomly allocated into two groups: a gum-chewing group (n=) or a control group (n =). Th e gum-chewing group participants who received one stick of sugar-less gum for one hours, three times daily immediately after recovery from anesthesia and the control group had the usual postoperative care until being discharged. All women were followed up regularly until discharge from hospital, and recorded the times to the first bowel sounds of normal intestinal sounds, the time to the first passage of flatus, the time to the fi rst feeling of hunger, and the time to the fi rst defecation. Th e operative data, postoperative tolerance of gum chewing, and postoperative complications were documented. Th ere was no statistically signifi cant diff erence between the two groups in terms of demographic characteristics such as age, body mass index, parity, duration of surgery, number of miscarriages and curettages, time to the fi rst feeding, the amount of serum intake, and type of cesarean section. Th e mean average postoperative interval of the fi rst bowel sounds (. versus. hours, p =.), the fi rst feeling of hunger (. versus. hours, p =.), the fi rst passage of fl atus (. versus. hours, P=.), the fi rst defecation (. versus. hours, P =.) was signifi cantly shorter com-pared to the control group. © Association of Basic Medical Sciences of FBIH.

40|$|Background: Oil pulling {{has been}} used {{extensively}} for many years, without scientific evidence or proof, as a traditional Indian folk remedy to prevent teeth decay, <b>oral</b> malodor, bleeding <b>gums,</b> dryness of throat and cracked lips, and for strengthening the teeth, gums, and jaws. Aims: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of oil pulling with sesame oil on the count of Streptococcus mutans in plaque and saliva of children, using the Dentocult SM Strip mutans test, and to compare its efficacy with that of chlorhexidine mouthwash. Materials and Methods: Twenty age-matched adolescent boys were selected based on information obtained through a questionnaire. They were divided randomly into two groups: the control or chlorhexidine group (group I) and the study or oil pulling group (group II); there were ten subjects in each group. Plaque and saliva samples were collected from all the 20 subjects on the strips from the Dentocult SM kit and, after incubation, the presence of S. mutans was evaluated using the manufacturers&#x 2032; chart. The study group practiced oil pulling with sesame oil and the control group used chlorhexidine mouthwash for 10 min every day in the morning before brushing. Samples were collected from both groups after 24 h, 48 h, 1 week, and 2 weeks and the efficacy of oil pulling was compared with that of chlorhexidine mouthwash. Results: There was a reduction in the S. mutans count in the plaque and saliva samples of both the study and the control groups. The reduction in the S. mutans count in the plaque of the study group was statistically significant after 1 and 2 weeks (P = 0. 01 and P = 0. 008, respectively); the control group showed significant reduction at all the four time points (P = 0. 01, P = 0. 04, P = 0. 005, and P = 0. 005, respectively, at 24 h, 48 h, 1 week, and 2 weeks). In the saliva samples, significant reduction in S. mutans count was seen in the control group at 48 h, 1 week, and 2 weeks (P = 0. 02, P = 0. 02, P = 0. 008, respectively). Conclusion: Oil pulling can be used as an effective preventive adjunct in maintaining and improving oral health...|$|R
40|$|Background: Carbohydrate {{ingestion}} and mouth-rinsing {{has been}} shown to improve exercise performance during high-intensity, short duration endurance exercise. The precise mechanisms underlying the ergogenic effects remains unidentified, but have been partially attributed to central effects being mediated via the detection of carbohydrate in the mouth by oral ‘energy-receptors’. Similarly, caffeine ingestion and delivery via the buccal cavity {{has been shown}} to improve endurance exercise performance, with ergogenic effects attributed to centrally mediated effects on adenosine receptor sites. However, no study has investigated whether providing carbohydrate and/or caffeine late in exercise can improve performance when under realistic conditions of exercise-induced fatigue. Aim: To determine the independent and combined effects of carbohydrate and caffeine chewing gum on self-paced cycling time-trial performance under the influence of exercise-induced fatigue. Further, the study aimed to examine the possibility of the chewing gums’ contents mediating central mechanistic effects on subconscious motor output (pacing) during time-trial performance. Method: Using a double-blind, repeated measures, cross over design, eleven male competitive cyclists (Mean ± SD: age: 32. 2 ± 7. 5 yr, body mass: 74. 3 ± 6. 8 kg; V̇O 2 peak: 60. 2 ± 4. 0 ml•kgˉ 1 •minˉ 1) performed 90 -min constant-load cycle at 80 % of their second ventilatory threshold (207 ± 30 W) followed by a 20 -km time-trial under each condition. At the beginning and at every 25 % of the total distance (5, 10, 15 km) during the time-trial, participants were given one piece of chewing gum to chew for 3 km (~ 5 min) containing either: placebo (PLA: artificial sweeteners), carbohydrate (CHO: ~ 1. 8 g sucrose per piece + artificial sweeteners), caffeine (CAF: 50 mg per piece + artificial sweeteners), and carbohydrate and caffeine (CHO+CAF: ~ 1. 8 g sucrose + 50 mg caffeine per piece + artificial sweeteners). Power output and heart rate were recorded continuously throughout the trial. Blood glucose and lactate samples were obtained before and after the time-trial, whilst perceptual measures on completion only. Data were analysed using an MS Excel spreadsheet designed for statistical analysis. The uncertainty in the effect was expressed as 90 % confidence limits and a smallest worthwhile effect of 1. 0 % for power output was assumed. Results: No substantial alterations in time-trial performance were observed with CHO (Mean ± SD: 271  35 W), CAF (273  40 W), or CHO+CAF (270  37 W) compared with PLA (270  37 W). However, mean power output had a tendency to be improved in the first two quarters of the 20 -km time-trial with CHO (Mean ± 90 %CL: 1. 6 ± 3. 1 and 0. 8 ± 2. 0 %); whilst in CAF and CHO+CAF trials, mean power output was substantially enhanced in the final quarter (4. 2 ± 3. 0 and 2. 0 ± 1. 8 %). No differences in heart rate (ES < 0. 2) were observed between trials. Blood lactate concentrations on completion of the time-trials were substantially higher for CAF (ES  90 %CL: 0. 90  1. 09 and 0. 85  0. 55, respectively), and CHO+CAF (0. 78  1. 14 and 0. 72  0. 62, respectively) than PLA and CHO trials. Differences in changes in blood glucose between experimental trials were small (+ 1. 1 - 1. 7 mmol/L- 1) and appeared unrelated to performance. Conclusion: Endurance performance, under conditions of fatigue and reduced glycogen, was not altered by the oral presence of carbohydrate and caffeine in chewing gum, either independently or combined. However, results support the theories of central activation and manipulation of the anticipatory regulation strategy in response to oral carbohydrate and/or caffeine by demonstrating subconsciously altered motor output during the time-trial. Specifically, carbohydrate appeared to facilitate an immediate increase in power output, whilst caffeine exhibited ergogenic effects later in exercise. Practically, the results suggest that 1) utilising an <b>oral</b> carbohydrate <b>gum,</b> in combination with prior ingestion of small amounts of carbohydrate early in exercise (< 90 min), or 2) the delivery of caffeine, via a chewing gum, in absence or presence of supplemental carbohydrate, may facilitate improvements in endurance performance by increasing central drive and thus, re-setting the internal pacing strategy to allow a higher power output at one’s self-selected ‘maximal’ work rate...|$|R
