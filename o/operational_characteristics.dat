In contrast Molten Salt Reactors (MSR) are capable of retaining the fuel mixture for significantly extended periods, which not only increases fuel efficiency dramatically, but also incinerates the vast majority of its own waste as part of the normal <b>operational</b> <b>characteristics.</b>|$|E

25|$|The obvious {{solution}} was to switch the Zeppelins' lifting gas from highly flammable hydrogen to inert helium. However, helium was only produced in the United States, was extremely expensive and had been embargoed since 1927. American airships equipped with helium were also forced to conserve it at all costs, which hampered their <b>operational</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Finally, a delay by the DZR to apply for an import license during a politically favorable moment in 1938 meant that it was deprived of the gas when relations between the US and Nazi Germany deteriorated soon after. In any event, helium's high cost would probably have made future operations of the huge zeppelins unprofitable, particularly in competition with the new flying boats.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origins of}} SC-21 {{lie in the}} {{realization}} by Admiral Joseph Metcalf III that new technologies such as vertical launch missiles permitted a complete rethink of warship design. He established a steering group, Group Mike, to study the possibilities. Group Mike sponsored two studies in 1987: the Ship <b>Operational</b> <b>Characteristics</b> Study (SOCS) and the Surface Combatant Force Requirement Study (SCFRS). Respectively, these studies sought to identify the <b>operational</b> <b>characteristics</b> required of an escort ship and estimate how many such ships were required by the fleet. Since it was expected {{at that time that}} the Navy would be fighting prolonged campaigns in the Norwegian Sea, SOCS put an emphasis on ships' continuing ability to fight after an initial Soviet attack. This in turn called for larger, more survivable escort ships than had historically been the norm, around 12,000tons, and for networking sensors and weapons together so that they could be used by the task force as a whole even if an individual ship had their radar disabled. Survivability also called for the bridge and Combat Information Center to be combined and [...] "buried" [...] {{in the heart of the}} ship, and for the ship to use electric drive to distribute the engineering around the ship. This would provide more room for weapons as well as the scope for future weapons such as railguns and lasers. SCFRS suggested that the Navy should not replace the Perry class frigate for convoy escort duties, but concentrate on building front-line combatants that could be assigned to less demanding convoy duties in their later years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{name and}} {{inspiration}} of the algorithm demand an interesting feature {{related to the}} temperature variation to be embedded in the <b>operational</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the algorithm. This necessitates a gradual reduction of the temperature as the simulation proceeds. The algorithm starts initially with [...] set to a high value (or infinity), and then it is decreased at each step following some annealing scheduleâ€”which may be specified by the user, but must end with [...] {{towards the end of}} the allotted time budget. [...] In this way, the system is expected to wander initially towards a broad region of the search space containing good solutions, ignoring small features of the energy function; then drift towards low-energy regions that become narrower and narrower; and finally move downhill according to the steepest descent heuristic.|$|E

2500|$|To obtain {{first-hand}} {{information on}} Korean air operations, CFE obtained approval from USAF Chief of Staff, Hoyt Vandenberg, to send four RAF pilots {{to observe and}} report. Second World War ace, Wing Commander John Baldwin, Squadron Leader Harbison, and two junior officers were selected for this task. Harbison's specific assignment was with the USAF 4th Fighter Group to evaluate combat tactics used by the F-86 against the Soviet MiG-15. On 13 February 1952, Harbison reported to Colonel Harrison Thyng, commander of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing at Kimpo Air Base, South Korea where {{he was assigned to}} the 335th Fighter Squadron. After attending [...] "Clobber College", a program where newly arrived pilots flew training sorties with experienced instructors, Harbison once again found himself flying combat missions. He enjoyed the flying and considered himself lucky for the opportunity to [...] "observe the air war along the Yalu River, arguably the best seat in the house". Harbison was credited with damaging a MiG-15 in combat and was awarded the United States Air Medal. After Baldwin failed to return from a weather reconnaissance mission, responsibility for completing the final report fell to Harbison. Despite the short notice and with little knowledge of the details Baldwin had intended to include, Harbison completed a 152-page report that evaluated the <b>operational</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the F-86 and the tactics used against the MiG-15.|$|E

40|$|As {{the primary}} {{protection}} of high voltage (HV) and Extra high voltage (EHV) transmission networks, distance protection needs to operate properly under all possible fault conditions. It needs {{to operate as}} fast as possible for internal fault, while it also must be able to discriminate between the internal and the external faults to prevent unnecessary trip of the normal system. In real life application, the <b>operational</b> <b>characteristic</b> of commercial distance relays such as operating time and reach accuracy are usually defined using the steady state conditions. This leads to difficulty in understanding the <b>operational</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the relay under the dynamic conditions such as faults. In this thesis, a dynamic test tool based on the latest IEC 60255 - 121 standard, suitable for performance analysis of distance protection during dynamic condition was developed and validated. The tools are built by using the ATP-EMTP Software and the Omicron secondary injection kit. The test results of two distance relays show that depending on the dynamic conditions, the operational performance of the relay might be affected. In some situations, the operating time of the relays was delayed, while, in other conditions, the accuracy of impedance measurement is affected causing the relay to overreach. Furthermore, this delayed tripping or overreach of distance protection could cause both security and dependability issue in power transmission protection. The dynamic test tool which has been developed can be expanded further to study other dynamic conditions that are not covered in this thesis. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis represents {{an analysis of}} the performance of the Naval Telecommunications System's (NTS) multichannel broadcast. It highlights the speed differential between the Naval Communications Processing and Routing Systems's (NACOMPARS) processing subsystems and the multichannel broadcast's transmission lines. In this effort, the message flow through the NAVCOMPARS is described. An analytic approach was chosen and input statistics, such as average message length and input rates, were gathered for queuing analysis. The <b>operational</b> <b>characteristic</b> upon which broadcast performance is evaluated is the average time delay in the system. The broadcast channel's ability to satisfy future communications requirements is also examined. The analysis demonstrates that, unless the increasing trends in message input rates are reversed or message lengths reduced, a dedicated broadcast overload channel would be required to meet communications requirements throughout the 1980 's.

40|$|Among the key {{requirements}} for advanced electronic systems {{is the ability}} to withstand harsh environments while maintaining reliable and efficient operation. Exposures to low temperature as well as high temperature constitute such stresses. Applications where low temperatures are encountered include deep space missions, medical imaging equipment, and cryogenic instrumentation. Efforts were taken to design and develop power capacitors capable of wide temperature operation. In this work, ceramic and film power capacitors were developed and characterized as a function of temperature from 20 C to - 185 C in terms of their dielectric properties. These properties included capacitance stability and dielectric loss in the frequency range of 50 Hz to 100 kHz. DC leakage current measurements were also performed on the capacitors.

40|$|In network {{security}} protocols, the freshness and uniqueness {{of a particular}} protocol-run provide a strong defense against replay attacks. These two properties are incorporated into a protocol interaction {{by the use of}} time-variant parameters such as nonces, random numbers, sequence numbers and timestamps. Many of the network authentication protocols can be classified into two main streams by the type of time-variant parameter they use; nonce or timestamp. Network authentication protocols based on timestamps are always more efficient in terms of numbers of rounds to their nonce-based counterparts. However, regardless of this favorable <b>operational</b> <b>characteristic,</b> most widely used protocols favor nonce-based schemes over timestamps. The main reason for this neglect of timestamp-based schemes was the difficulty of establishing synchronized clocks over a widely distributed network in- 71 72 frastructure spanning multiple administrative domains.
