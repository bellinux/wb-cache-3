40|$|The paper {{develops}} a general {{framework for the}} formulation of generic uniform laws <b>of</b> <b>large</b> numbers.

We also develop a truncation approach. {{that makes it possible}} to obtain uniform laws <b>of</b> <b>large</b> numbers for the functions under consideration from uniform laws <b>of</b> <b>large</b> numbers for truncated versions of those functions. The point of the truncation approach is that uniform laws <b>of</b> <b>large</b> numbers for the truncated versions are typically easier to obtain. By combining the basic uniform law <b>of</b> <b>large</b> numbers and the truncation approach we also derive generalizations of recent uniform laws <b>of</b> <b>large</b> numbers introduced in Potscher and Prucha [13, l 5]. ...|$|R

5|$|After small planetesimals—about 1km in diameter—have {{formed by}} {{one way or}} another, runaway {{accretion}} begins. It is called runaway because the mass growth rate is proportional to , where R and M are the radius and mass of the growing body, respectively. It {{is obvious that the}} specific (divided by mass) growth accelerates as the mass increases. This leads to the preferential growth <b>of</b> <b>larger</b> bodies at the expense of smaller ones. The runaway accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000years and ends when the largest bodies exceed approximately 1,000km in diameter. Slowing of the accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by large bodies on the remaining planetesimals. In addition, the influence <b>of</b> <b>larger</b> bodies stops further growth of smaller bodies.|$|E
