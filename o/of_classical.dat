5|$|Although {{at various}} times the Byzantines made {{magnificent}} achievements {{in the application of}} the sciences, and are responsible for preserving much of ancient knowledge, some authors have argued that Byzantine scholars made few novel contributions to science in terms of developing new theories or extending the ideas <b>of</b> <b>classical</b> authors.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} <b>of</b> <b>classical</b> {{mechanics}} {{is the notion}} that a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames <b>of</b> <b>classical</b> mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.|$|E
