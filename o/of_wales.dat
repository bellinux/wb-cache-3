5|$|Albert Victor {{was born}} two months prematurely on 8 January 1864 at Frogmore House, Windsor, Berkshire. He {{was the first}} child of Albert Edward, Prince <b>of</b> <b>Wales,</b> and Alexandra, Princess <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> (formerly Princess Alexandra of Denmark). Following his {{grandmother}} Queen Victoria's wishes, he was named Albert Victor, after herself and her late husband Albert. As a grandchild of the reigning British monarch in the male line, and a son of the Prince <b>of</b> <b>Wales,</b> he was formally styled His Royal Highness Prince Albert Victor <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> from birth.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{affection for}} Mary, Henry was deeply {{disappointed}} that his marriage had produced no sons. By the time Mary {{was nine years}} old, {{it was apparent that}} Henry and Catherine would have no more children, leaving Henry without a legitimate male heir. In 1525, Henry sent Mary to the border <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> to preside, presumably in name only, over the Council <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> and the Marches. She was given her own court based at Ludlow Castle and many of the royal prerogatives normally reserved for the Prince <b>of</b> <b>Wales.</b> Vives and others called her the Princess <b>of</b> <b>Wales,</b> although she was never technically invested with the title. She appears to have spent three years in the Welsh Marches, making regular visits to her father's court, before returning permanently to the home counties around London in mid-1528.|$|E

5|$|During the war, {{plans were}} drawn up to quell Welsh {{nationalism}} by affiliating Elizabeth {{more closely with}} Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included a fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd, {{at a time when}} Britain was at war. Welsh politicians suggested that she be made Princess <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> and the Prince <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> had always been the heir apparent. In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod <b>of</b> <b>Wales.</b>|$|E
5|$|George's grandfather, King George II, {{disliked the}} Prince <b>of</b> <b>Wales,</b> and took little {{interest}} in his grandchildren. However, in 1751 the Prince <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> died unexpectedly from a lung injury, and George became heir apparent to the throne. He inherited one of his father's titles and became the Duke of Edinburgh. Now more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George Prince <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> (the title is not automatically acquired).|$|E

5|$|After his {{accession}} in Great Britain, George's {{relationship with}} his son (which had always been poor) worsened. George Augustus, Prince <b>of</b> <b>Wales,</b> encouraged opposition to his father's policies, including measures designed to increase religious freedom in Britain and expand Hanover's German territories {{at the expense of}} Sweden. In 1717 the birth of a grandson led to a major quarrel between George and the Prince <b>of</b> <b>Wales.</b> The King, supposedly following custom, appointed the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke of Newcastle, as one of the baptismal sponsors of the child. The King was angered when the Prince <b>of</b> <b>Wales,</b> disliking Newcastle, verbally insulted the Duke at the christening, which the Duke misunderstood as a challenge to a duel. The Prince was told to leave the royal residence, St. James's Palace. The Prince's new home, Leicester House, became a meeting place for the King's political opponents. George and his son were later reconciled at the insistence of Robert Walpole and the desire of the Princess <b>of</b> <b>Wales,</b> who had moved out with her husband but missed her children who had been left in the care of the King. However, following the quarrel at the baptism, father and son would never again be on cordial terms.|$|E

5|$|As a {{young man}} destined {{to serve in the}} navy, Prince George served for many years under the command of his uncle, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who was {{stationed}} in Malta. There, he grew close to {{and fell in love with}} his uncle's daughter, Princess Marie. His grandmother, father and uncle all approved the match, but the mothers—the Princess <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> and the Duchess of Edinburgh—both opposed it. The Princess <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> thought the family was too pro-German, and the Duchess of Edinburgh disliked England. Marie's mother was the only daughter of Tsar Alexander II of Russia. She resented the fact that, as the wife of a younger son of the British sovereign, she had to yield precedence to George's mother, the Princess <b>of</b> <b>Wales,</b> whose father had been a minor German prince before being called unexpectedly to the throne of Denmark. Guided by her mother, Marie refused George when he proposed to her. She married Ferdinand, the heir to the King of Romania, in 1893.|$|E
5|$|At Swansea, the Tennant Canal {{could be}} relinked to the Prince <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> Dock, and hence to the River Tawe, {{which has become}} a large marina since the {{construction}} of a tidal barrage. This could then provide a link to a restored Swansea Canal. Associated British Ports, who run Swansea Docks, rejected the idea of a canal link in 1997, but since then the Prince <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> Dock has become the subject of a regeneration scheme, and a route for the canal has been reserved in the planning document. The feasibility of this scheme and a possible route was investigated in a report by the engineers W. S. Atkins published in 2003. A report for Natural Resources Wales by Trilein Ltd. recommended a range of initiatives to better connect the urban areas of the city to the more rural east of the county, including Crymlyn Bog. The reconnection of the Tennant Canal to the Prince <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> Dock was again outlined in that report.|$|E
