[...] The project had the working title Quiver, after the Arrowhead military base from Stephen King's 1980 novella The Mist, an early inspiration for the game.

DIGITAL SKETCH was an attempt to create a foundation course in design for the digital medium for students with strong visual design skills, but little to no computer experience. Teaching design on computers is commonly thought of as detailing the current version of the latest commercial software. As long as this is the case, design on computers will (quite rightfully) continue to get little respect from those designers using more traditional design methods. How can we find the “corei of this medium when faced with the constant onslaught of operating system upgrades and version 11. 2 of software Y 83 ? For DIGITAL SKETCH, we tried to demystify the process of controlling the computer.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the performance of}} two classic approximation algorithms which work by scanning the input and greedily constructing a solution. We investigate whether running these algorithms on a random permutation of the input can increase their performance ratio. We obtain the following results: 1. Johnson’s approximation algorithm for MAX-SAT {{is one of the}} first approximation algorithms to be rigorously analyzed. It has <b>been</b> shown <b>that</b> the performance ratio of this algorithm is 2 / 3. We show that when executed on a random permutation of the variables, the performance ratio of this algorithm is improved to 2 / 3 + c for some c> 0. This resolves an open problem of Chen, Friesen and Zhang [3]. 2. Motivated by the above improvement, we {{consider the}} performance of the greedy algorithm for MAX-CUT whose performance ratio is 1 / 2. <b>Our</b> <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> running the greedy algorithm on a random permutation of the vertices would result in a 1 / 2 + c approximation algorithm. However, it turns out that in this case the performance of the algorithm remains 1 / 2. This resolves an open problem of Mathieu and Schudy [9]...|$|R

In any case, resulting/accompanying inflammation <b>was</b> so severe <b>that</b> anti-inflammatory therapy <b>was</b> <b>our</b> focus. <b>Our</b> <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> as we <b>were</b> shielding the eye from concurrent inflammation, natural mechanisms might lead to resolution of any hemorrhage. Vitrectomy was contemplated to remove inflammatory debris, clear the visual axis, and afford visualization of the posterior pole. Theoretically, it is the sole direct intervention for a vitreous hemorrhage. Such intense inflammation with fluctuating intraocular pressures, however, bred fear of vitrectomy pushing the eye into phthisis. Hence, our strategy was steroid therapy and close observation (inpatient care), with systemic immunosuppressive agents on standby. For any surgery, we prefer an eye with minimum signs of inflammation, particularly anterior segment cells and flare, and no signs of exudative retinal detachment. Inpatient care allowed us to document improving visual acuity and B-scan picture, particularly over the critical first month. This permitted us to maintain our strategy, and with reestablished view of the posterior pole, we now reserve any surgery for a much later date.|$|R
