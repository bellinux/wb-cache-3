He had visited the Ross Island penal settlement. The attack on Lord Mayo {{was carried out by}} Sher Ali, one of the convicts of the penal colony who was on a sick leave; the assassination was carried <b>out</b> <b>while</b> Mayo was returning after a pleasant trip to Mount Harriet on the evening of 8 February 1872.

Later when Confederate forces abandoned Norfolk on 11 May 1862, they were forced to destroy Virginia.|$|E

After {{a telephone call}} between Chauvel and Chetwode, pressure continued to be exerted and an attack by all units took place at 16:30. The Ottoman garrison held on until the dismounted attackers were within , but by that time, {{there was no doubt}} that the Ottoman garrison was losing the fight, and they began to surrender in small groups. All organised resistance ceased ten minutes later and as darkness fell, sporadic firing petered <b>out,</b> <b>while</b> prisoners were rounded up, horses collected and watered at the captured wells. Then Chauvel rode into Magdhaba and gave the order to clear the battlefield.|$|E

5|$|However, a new wrinkle {{appeared}} {{when the}} City of Denver refused {{to transfer the}} parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had made his bid in his own name, and the City wanted to protect itself in case Sturm either died or sold the teams before the 25 years ran <b>out.</b> <b>While</b> Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he wasn't willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.|$|E

In April 2013, Disney officially announced the title on Twitter as Inside Out, during CinemaCon. Prior to its release, the film underwent a test screening for children, due to concerns from executives that it would be too complex for younger audiences—a fear quelled when the audience reacted positively to the picture.|$|E
5|$|Inside the {{magnetosphere}} is the plasmasphere, a donut-shaped region containing low-energy charged particles, or plasma. This region {{begins at}} {{a height of}} 60km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth. There are also two concentric tire-shaped regions, called the Van Allen radiation belts, with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10million electron volts (MeV)). The inner belt is 1–2Earth radii <b>out</b> <b>while</b> the outer belt is at 4–7Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.|$|E

He trailed the German bombers back to France {{and attacked}} {{them where they}} believed they were safe. In fact both of his victims were Ju 88s which crashed near Dinard. From Feldwebel Robert Bogel's Wrk Nr. 1528, only the gunner was able to bail <b>out,</b> <b>while</b> observer Leutnant zur See (naval rank) Roman Wallner and Obergefreiter Johan Beibl were killed.

5|$|The Early English Gothic chapel of Lambeth Palace {{dates from}} work carried <b>out</b> <b>while</b> Boniface was archbishop. Boniface left England in November 1268, and never returned. He died 18 July 1270, in Savoy. He was buried {{with his family}} in the Cistercian abbey of Hautecombe in Savoy. In his will, he left {{legacies}} to all the houses of the Franciscans and Dominicans in the diocese of Canterbury. His will had differing provisions for his burial depending on whether he died in England, France, or near the Alps. Oddly enough, his official seal included a head of the pagan god Jupiter Serapis along with the usual depiction of the archbishop in full vestments.|$|E
5|$|The MCC {{match was}} {{followed}} by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, which was against Lancashire. Loxton top-scored with 39 as Australia batted first and were bowled out for 204 after the first day was washed out. He then took 0/18 from eight overs and made 52 in the second innings before being run <b>out</b> <b>while</b> batting with Harvey as the match ended in a draw.

5|$|The Malayan Emergency was {{a guerrilla}} {{war between the}} Federation of Malaya—a {{protectorate}} of Britain until August 1957, {{and part of the}} Commonwealth of Nations thereafter—and the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), the armed wing of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). The MNLA sought to topple the Malayan government and force the British <b>out,</b> <b>while</b> the Commonwealth worked to prevent this. The conflict had its roots in the Second World War, in which groups of local ethnic Chinese fought alongside Britain's limited forces in the country against the occupying Imperial Japanese; these Malayan Chinese subscribed to communist political thinking, and called themselves the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army.|$|E
5|$|The Malloch Building was {{featured}} in the 1947 film noir work titled Dark Passage.

In the apartment, Bogart hides <b>out</b> <b>while</b> he heals from plastic surgery, and plots to clear his name. Bogart wearily ascends the nearby Filbert Steps in one scene, on his way to the Malloch Building. Modern-day residents have been known to put a cutout of Bogart in the street-facing window of Number 10.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{recorded}} incidents of CFM56 engines flaming out in heavy rain and/or hail conditions, beginning {{early in the}} CFM56's career. In 1987, a double flameout occurred in hail conditions (the pilots managed to relight the engines), followed by the TACA Flight 110 incident in 1988. Both CFM56 engines on the TACA 737 flamed <b>out</b> <b>while</b> passing through hail and heavy rain, and the crew was forced to land without engines on a grassy levee near New Orleans, Louisiana. CFMI modified the engines by adding a sensor to force the combustor to continuously ignite under these conditions.|$|E
