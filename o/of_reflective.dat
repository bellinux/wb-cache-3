5|$|Surmising the Siren {{is using}} {{water as a}} portal, the Doctor instructs {{everyone}} to seek refuge in the ship's dry magazine. There, they find Toby Avery (Oscar Lloyd), {{the son of the}} ship's captain Henry Avery (Hugh Bonneville), who stowed away on the ship in order to join the crew after his mother died, unaware of his father's illicit deeds. He too has a black spot on his palm due to a fever. In an attempt to escape, the Doctor and Avery board the TARDIS, but find it is acting haphazardly, and are forced to evacuate, and they watch as it dematerializes by itself. After another shipmate is taken by the Siren in a dry room, the Doctor realizes the Siren is using reflection to appear. In response they rid the ship <b>of</b> <b>reflective</b> surfaces, including the ship's stolen treasure.|$|E
5|$|Although, {{the use of}} oil as {{a binding}} agent {{can be traced to}} the 12th century, {{innovations}} in its handling and manipulation define the era. Egg tempera was the dominant medium until the 1430s, and while it produces both bright and light colours, it dries quickly and is a difficult medium in which to achieve naturalistic textures or deep shadows. Oil allows smooth, translucent surfaces and can be applied in a range of thicknesses, from fine lines to thick broad strokes. It dries slowly and is easily manipulated while still wet. These characteristics allowed more time to add subtle detail and enable wet-on-wet techniques. Smooth transitions of colour are possible because portions of the intermediary layers of paint can be wiped or removed as the paint dries. Oil enables differentiation among degrees <b>of</b> <b>reflective</b> light, from shadow to bright beams, and minute depictions of light effects through the use of transparent glazes. This new freedom in controlling light effects gave rise to more precise and realistic depictions of surface textures; van Eyck and van der Weyden typically show light falling on surfaces such as jewellery, wooden floors, textiles and household objects.|$|E

25|$|If {{all three}} of the {{original}} generating circles have the same radius then the Apollonian gasket has three lines <b>of</b> <b>reflective</b> symmetry; these lines are the mutual tangents of each pair of circles.

25|$|If {{two of the}} {{original}} generating circles have the same radius and the third circle has a radius that is two-thirds of this, then the Apollonian gasket has two lines <b>of</b> <b>reflective</b> symmetry; one line is the line joining the centres of the equal circles; the other is their mutual tangent, which passes through {{the centre of the}} third circle. These lines are perpendicular to one another, so the Apollonian gasket also has rotational symmetry of degree 2; the symmetry group of this gasket is D2.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this inquiry was to {{construct}} a model for facilitation <b>of</b> critical <b>reflective</b> practice, based on thorough analysis of the main concepts (critical thinking and reflection), related viewpoints, models and theories; and the data gathered and analyzed during, the naturalistic inquiry. The constructed model evolved from empirical observations, intuitive insights of the inquirer and from deductions combining ideas from several fields of inquiry. The model for facilitation <b>of</b> critical <b>reflective</b> practice postualates that practitioners have the inherent potential to change from auto-pilot practice to critical reflective practice. The purpose of the model is the facilitation of heightened awarenss of the self, to enable health care professionals to consciously meet community needs and expectations. The desired outcome is transformative intellectuals who will strive to empower others to become critical reflective learners and practitioners themselves. The process followed during {{the construction of the}} model and the constructed model will be discussed in three (3) articles, namely: • A model for facilitation <b>of</b> critical <b>reflective</b> practice: Part I - Introductory discussion and explanation of the phases followed to construct the model. • A model for facilitation <b>of</b> critical <b>reflective</b> practice: Part II - Conceptual analysis within the context of constructing the model. • A model for facilitation <b>of</b> critical <b>reflective</b> practice: Part III - Description of the model...|$|R
25|$|Although the Chinese of the Han Dynasty (202 BC–202 AD) {{believed}} the Moon to be energy equated to qi, their 'radiating influence' theory {{recognized that the}} light of the Moon was merely a reflection of the Sun (mentioned by Anaxagoras above). This was supported by mainstream thinkers such as Jing Fang, who noted the sphericity of the Moon. Shen Kuo (1031–1095) of the Song Dynasty (960–1279) created an allegory equating the waxing and waning of the Moon to a round ball <b>of</b> <b>reflective</b> silver that, when doused with white powder and viewed from the side, would appear to be a crescent.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, {{change was}} gradual. Pre-industrial signs were stone or wood, {{but with the}} {{development}} of Darby's method of smelting iron using coke, painted cast iron became favoured in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Cast iron continued to be used until the mid-20th century, but it was gradually displaced by aluminium or other materials and processes, such as vitreous enamelled and/or pressed malleable iron, or (later) steel. Since 1945 most signs have been made from sheet aluminium with adhesive plastic coatings; these are normally retroreflective for nighttime and low-light visibility. Before the development <b>of</b> <b>reflective</b> plastics, reflectivity was provided by glass reflectors set into the lettering and symbols.|$|E
25|$|The Entrance Hall {{contains}} a white staircase {{leading to the}} second floor of the house with a wall <b>of</b> <b>reflective</b> mirrors.

His daughter Lisa Marie's bedroom is in the northeast corner, and a bedroom in the southeast corner served as Elvis' private personal office. The second floor is not open to visitors out of respect for the Presley family and partially to avoid any improper focus on the bathroom which was the site of his death. The floor has been untouched since the day Elvis died and is rarely seen by non-family members.|$|E

25|$|Pike {{make use}} of the lateral line system to follow the {{vortices}} produced by the perceived prey, and the whirling movement of the spinner is probably a good way to imitate or exaggerate these. Jerkbaits are also effective and can produce spectacular bites with pike attacking these erratic-moving lures at full speed. For trolling, big plugs or softbaits can be used. Spoons with mirror finishes are very effective when the sun is at a sharp angle to the water in the mornings or evenings because they generate the vibrations previously discussed and cause a glint <b>of</b> <b>reflective</b> sunlight that mimics the flash of white-bellied prey. Most fishermen tend to use small lures, but often that is not advisable because pike have a preference for large prey. When fishing in shallow water for smaller pike, lighter and smaller lures are frequently used. The humble 'woolly bugger' fly is a favourite lure among keen fly fisherman of the southern hemisphere.|$|E

His first project on Captiva Island was a 16.5-meter-long {{silkscreen}} print called Currents (1970), made with newspapers from {{the first two months}} of the year, followed by Cardboards (1970–71) and Early Egyptians (1973–74), the latter of which is a series of wall reliefs and sculptures constructed from used boxes. He also printed on textiles using his solvent-transfer technique to make the Hoarfrosts (1974–76) and Spreads (1975–82), and in the Jammers (1975–76), created a series of colorful silk wall and floor works. Urban Bourbons (1988–95) focused on different methods of transferring images onto a variety <b>of</b> <b>reflective</b> metals, such as steel and aluminum. In addition, throughout the 1990s, Rauschenberg continued to utilize new materials while still working with more rudimentary techniques, such as wet fresco, as in the Arcadian Retreat (1996) series, and the transfer of images by hand, as in the Anagrams (1995–2000). As part of his engagement with the latest technological innovations, he began making digital Iris prints and using biodegradable vegetable dyes in his transfer processes, underscoring his commitment to caring for the environment.|$|E
