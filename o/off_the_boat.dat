A hurricane sweeps through the town, ultimately destroying the house but allowing the children to flee before the structure falls apart. They sail to the cave and rescue her, but attract leeches due to Josephine having eaten a banana. Olaf appears and takes the kids with him, throwing Josephine <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and to the Lachrymose Leeches after she annoys him by correcting his speech.|$|E
