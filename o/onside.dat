5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Mississippi came {{storming}} back. Following the field goal, Tech head coach Jerry Claiborne ordered an <b>onside</b> kick {{in an effort}} to gain another chance on offense and potentially build an insurmountable lead. <b>Onside</b> kicks, unlike an ordinary free kick, can be recovered by the kicking team—but only after the ball has traveled 10 yards. If the kicking team touches the ball before it has traveled 10 yards, the receiving team takes possession at the place the ball was touched. Unfortunately for Virginia Tech, Simsak's <b>onside</b> kick—though it surprised Ole Miss—did not travel the requisite 10 yards. Mississippi took over at the Virginia Tech 49-yard line, and many of the Ole Miss players were angered by what they considered to be an insult.|$|E
5|$|Brett Jaekle handled all of Nevada's kicking duties. He {{made all}} five extra-point attempts. Jaekle punted eight times for 295yards and kicked off five times for 270yards. With 1:42remaining, he {{attempted}} an <b>onside</b> kick, but {{the ball was}} recovered by Maryland's Danny Oquendo.|$|E
5|$|On {{the kickoff}} {{following}} the field goal, Georgia head coach Mark Richt ordered an unorthodox <b>onside</b> kick. Surprised by the unexpected play, the Virginia Tech coverage team {{was unable to}} recover the ball, which was leapt upon by the kicker, Brian Mimbs. With a new chance at offense {{and a sense of}} optimism triggered by the successful <b>onside</b> kick, Georgia drove down the field. Aided by 20yards in penalties against Virginia Tech, the drive resulted in a six-yard touchdown pass to Martrez Milner. The touchdown and extra point boosted Georgia's morale and cut the score to 21–13, Virginia Tech leading by eight.|$|E

5000|$|After seven {{dramatic}} {{victories in}} a row, the Patriots fell flat in a 20-13 loss {{in their first}} playoff game since 1986. Drew Bledsoe was picked off three times despite a game-tying rally in the second quarter; he threw the ball 50 times but completed just 22 passes. Leroy Hoard and Earnest Byner totaled 96 rushing yards, outrushing the entire Patriots offensive backfield (57 yards). The win {{was the first in}} a playoff game for Browns head coach Bill Belichick. The Patriots successfully executed an <b>onsides</b> kick in this game; they would not succeed with an <b>onsides</b> kick until 2013, coincidentally against the Browns ...|$|R
50|$|Ross {{scored on}} a 3-yard run in the 4th, to give the Buckeyes a 24-7 lead, {{just as they had}} possessed the week before. And just as the week before, Bowling Green mounted a furious 4th quarter comeback, scoring a {{touchdown}} with 3:25 left to go, and a recovering the <b>onsides</b> kick. A field goal {{at the end of that}} drive had OSU fans on the edge of their seats. OSU recovered BG's second <b>onsides</b> kick attempt, but failed to run out the clock. It wouldn’t be until who-else-but safety Will Allen intercepted Harris's final pass that the fans could relax. Ohio State had scored their 4th win of the season, and 18th straight.|$|R
5|$|For {{years he}} ruled supreme in Dixie, and his teams won many glorious intersectional victories. More {{than any one}} man, he was {{responsible}} for the progress of southern football.... He was the first coach to successfully work the <b>onside</b> kick. He {{was among the first to}} bring out guards in the interference.... His name will never die.|$|E
5|$|In 1906 (the {{first year}} of the legal forward pass and <b>onside</b> kick) his team {{defeated}} Carlisle, had a third-team Walter Camp All-American in Owsley Manier (the South's first), and were for some writers the entire All-Southern eleven. McGugin had his team practice the pass by playing baseball with a football.|$|E
5|$|In a {{situation}} with more time, Virginia Tech would have kicked the ball off to Florida State and {{hoped for a}} defensive stop to give the offense {{a chance for a}} game-winning drive. With less than twominutes remaining, however, and with Virginia Tech having used all its timeouts, the only chance for the Hokies was to attempt a difficult <b>onside</b> kick. A successful recovery would give the Hokies another chance on offense. Kicker Brandon Pace teed up the ball, and kicked it forwards, bouncing the ball high into the air to create a jump ball situation. Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi recovered the ball, but because the kick had only traveled nineyards before the recovery, the ball was awarded to Florida State. NCAA rules state that an <b>onside</b> kick must travel at least 10yards before the kicking team can legally touch the ball, and Pace's kick had not traveled the requisite distance.|$|E
50|$|The Tigers {{began the}} third quarter by {{recovering}} an <b>onsides</b> kick. Senior kicker Wes Byrum recovered his own kick at the Auburn 41-yard line. Nine plays later, Onterrio McCalebb rushed two yards for a touchdown, and Auburn went ahead 28-21. It {{was the first time}} Auburn had led in the game since the Bulldogs tied the game near the midway point of the first quarter. Auburn’s lead was short-lived, as the Bulldogs tied the game at 28-28 six plays later on seven-yard run by Washaun Ealey.|$|R
50|$|After a lackluster draft {{which saw}} the team draft three cornerbacks {{to replace the}} {{departure}} of star cornerback Deion Sanders, the Dave Campo head coaching era would have an inauspicious start with an embarrassing blow-out defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles at home (in which the Eagles recovered an <b>onsides</b> kick on the opening kickoff). The loss {{would prove to be}} even more costly as quarterback Troy Aikman would suffer a serious concussion early in the game and newly acquired wide receiver Joey Galloway would suffer a season-ending injury in the fourth quarter.|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous example of a squib kick is the {{controversial}} last-second kickoff return, nicknamed [...] "The Play", during the November 20, 1982 college football game between the University of California, Berkeley ("California" [...] or [...] "Cal") Golden Bears and their arch-rival, the Stanford Cardinal. Stanford took the lead 20-19 with only four seconds remaining in the game. Anticipating a squib kick, Cal coach Joe Kapp sent his <b>onsides</b> return team into the game. The players recovered the ball and lateraled it five times [...] - [...] two of them controversial [...] - [...] to score a touchdown to win the game.|$|R
5|$|The 1912 season saw the NCAA {{implement}} several rule {{changes to}} increase scoring. These included: {{the value of}} a touchdown increased from 5 points to 6, the length of the field was reduced to 100 yards, 10-yard end zones were added, the <b>onside</b> kick was eliminated, and unlimited use of the forward pass was introduced.|$|E
5|$|The loss {{dropped the}} Bears to 5–9 and officially {{eliminated}} them from playoff contention. Cutler's {{touchdown pass to}} Jeffery was his 200th career touchdown pass, while the <b>onside</b> kick attempted {{at the start of}} the third quarter was Gould's first successful kick in his eleven-year career with the Bears.|$|E
5|$|Although the Mean Green had not {{scored on}} its first {{possession}} in its previous eight games, the team scored on its opening drive against the Midshipmen when wide receiver Casey Fitzgerald caught a nine-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Giovanni Vizza. The Mean Green recovered an <b>onside</b> kick on the ensuing kickoff and scored another touchdown on the following drive. After the Midshipmen kicked a field goal on their first possession, North Texas added another touchdown, giving them a 21–3 lead. Navy scored a touchdown with seven seconds remaining in the quarter. The period ended with the Mean Green ahead, 21–10.|$|E
50|$|The Ducks evened their 2009 {{record at}} 1-1 with a thrilling 38-36 win over Purdue {{in their first}} visit to Eugene. Jeremiah Masoli rushed for 84 yards and a {{touchdown}} and LaMichael James rushed for 56 yards. Walter Thurmond III returned an interception for a touchdown {{in the first half and}} Javes Lewis returned a fumble for a touchdown in the third quarter. With a minute and one second left to play Purdue failed on a two-point conversion that would have tied the game. Oregon recovered the <b>onsides</b> kick attempt and ran out the clock. Jamere Holland had 72 yards on 4 receptions but dropped a sure touchdown pass in the fourth quarter.|$|R
500|$|In the fourthquarter, Colt McCoy set up {{the go-ahead}} score with a {{scramble}} to the TCU one-yard line. Vondrell McGee scored a touchdown twoplays later. [...] Texas' next possession resulted in a secondfield goal by Ryan Bailey. [...] The Longhorn defense held TCU to a three-and-out but TCU's punter fumbled the ball, and Brandon Foster ran the ball in for a touchdown, capping 27straight points for Texas. [...] The Frogs came back and scored 37-yard field goal by Manfredini and then attempted an <b>onsides</b> kick but Texas recovered the ball. [...] UT's Jamaal Charles made a 39-yard rushing touchdown for the game's final score. [...] Texas won, 34–13. [...] The attendance for the game, 84,621, was the third-largest crowd ever to watch a TCU football game.|$|R
25|$|Desmond Cooper would recover a Daniel Croghan fumble on Charlotte’s 3 yard line {{to end a}} Charleston Southern drive. Two plays later Alan Barnwell {{would be}} tackled {{in the end zone}} by Caleb Batchelor for a safety. Charleston Southern would then attempt an <b>onsides</b> kick, by the 49ers would recover the ball. Charleston Southern would pad their lead with two late {{touchdown}}s. The first on a Kyle Copeland’s third rushing touchdown of the day, this time from the 5 yard line. Zac Bumgardner would recover an Alan Barnwell fumble on Charlotte’s Next play from scrimmage. Three plays later the Buccaneers would score the final points of the game on a Mike Holloway 5 yard rushing touchdown. The game would end in a Buccaneer home victory of 35 to 14, and the Charlotte 49ers’ second road loss of the season.|$|R
5|$|As {{champions of}} the Football League, Burnley {{qualified}} for the Charity Shield, then known as the Dewar Shield. Burnley's opponents were Tottenham Hotspur, who had finished sixth in the First Division and beaten Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup final. In what was the last match of the 1920–21 campaign, Burnley fell to a 0–2 loss at White Hart Lane on 16May 1921. The match was not without controversy, as the Burnley players claimed that the second goal should have been disallowed despite the Tottenham goalscorer being <b>onside,</b> maintaining that the whistle had already been blown by the referee.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half Freddie (Froggie) Meiers carried an <b>onside</b> kick over for a touchdown, but it was called back. The Tennessee backs were {{repeatedly}} thrown for no gains or losses all game, and steady improvement by the Commodores was noticed. Vanderbilt's starting lineup was McCullough (left end), Bradford (left tackle), Bailey (left guard), Sharpe (center), Overall (right guard), Elam (right tackle), Ryan (right end), Kuhn (quarterback), Smith (left halfback), Neely (right halfback), and Bomar (fullback).|$|E
5|$|Kaepernick {{took over}} on the Nevada 23-yard line with 4:01and made four {{completions}} {{to drive to the}} Terps' 15-yard line. Exploiting a large opening, Kaepernick held onto the ball and ran it into the end zone to narrow Maryland's lead to one touchdown, 42–35, with 2:19remaining. Jaekle attempted an <b>onside</b> kick in an effort to give Nevada another chance on offense, but the ball was recovered by Maryland receiver Danny Oquendo. Scott rushed for two and then 19yards. With the first down, Maryland had enough time to run out the clock and clinch the 42–35victory.|$|E
50|$|Hosting Monday Night Football the Seahawks' roller-coaster of {{a season}} {{continued}} as they fell to 6-6 to the now-5-7 Cowboys. The Hawks led 14-3 after one quarter, but in the second the Cowboys scored 23 points (botching a two-point attempt after Vinny Testaverde's touchdown to Terrance Copper). In the fourth Matt Hasselbeck (414 total yards) erupted to three touchdown drives, two of them ending in Shaun Alexander rushes, a 19-yard score to Jerheme Urban, and a two-point conversion to Darrell Jackson, but the Seahawks could not hold on to a 39-29 lead; Testaverde found Keyshawn Johnson for a 34-yard touchdown with 1:54 to go; the Cowboys kicked <b>onsides</b> and recovered, then four Julius Jones rushes ended in a 17-yard score with 37 seconds remaining. The Seahawks' final drive petered out and the Cowboys had the stunning 43-39 win.|$|R
40|$|We {{begin by}} {{reviewing}} and proving the basic facts of combinatorial game theory. We then consider scoring games (also known as Milnor games or positional games), {{focusing on the}} "fixed-length" games for which all sequences of play terminate after {{the same number of}} moves. The theory of fixed-length scoring games is shown to have properties similar to the theory of loopy combinatorial games, with operations similar to <b>onsides</b> and offsides. We give a complete description of the structure of fixed-length scoring games in terms of the class of short partizan games. We also consider fixed-length scoring games taking values in the two-element boolean algebra, and classify these games up to indistinguishability. We then apply these results to analyze some positions in the knotting-unknotting game of Pechenik, Townsend, Henrich, MacNaughton, and Silversmith.

5000|$|The Longhorns {{entered the}} 2007 season ranked {{third in the}} all-time list of both total wins and winning percentage. [...] A 2007 {{pre-season}} ranking by ESPN writer Mark Schlabach had the Longhorns ranked eighth, while College Football News had Texas ranked third. [...] The Longhorns came into the season ranked fourth in both the Coaches Poll and AP Poll. [...] Texas struggled {{in the first three}} games of the season. Their opening game was UT's first contest against Arkansas State University and the team narrowly achieved a victory. [...] Next, they beat the TCU Horned Frogs in a game that required Texas to recover an <b>onsides</b> kick. For their first road game of the season, the Longhorns were the first opponent for the University of Central Florida (UCF) Knights in their new stadium. The Longhorns struggled in all three games and won by smaller margins than expected.|$|R
5|$|After {{the ball}} {{rolled into the}} end zone for a touchback, Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Bryan Randall {{completed}} an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the extra point cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an <b>onside</b> kick {{in order to have a}} chance to get another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would be free to run out the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them to run out the clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{excellent}} field position, Virginia Tech seemed in position for an easy score. However, after a quick Tech first down, the Georgia defense stiffened and Tech was forced to settle for a field goal. The 28-yard kick by Brandon Pace cut Georgia's lead to 31–24, but only 3:42 remained on the clock. Due to the short time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an <b>onside</b> kick in order to have another chance at offense. The kick was recovered by Georgia, however, and the Bulldogs proceeded to rush the ball in three consecutive plays, forcing the Hokies to use their last timeout in order to conserve time for one final drive.|$|E
5|$|In August2007, Frank Beamer closed team {{practices}} to outside observers {{for the first}} time in 20years. He cited concerns about unknown individuals watching Virginia Tech practice in Atlanta before the Hokies' loss to Georgia, potentially leading to the defeat. During the 2007season, Virginia Tech quarterback Sean Glennon was replaced as the Hokies' starter by freshman Tyrod Taylor, causing many pundits to point to the four interceptions Glennon threw in the Chick-fil-A Bowl as an example of his failure as a quarterback. Brian Mimbs, the former walk-on who kicked and recovered the <b>onside</b> kick that began Georgia's rally was named the Bulldogs' starting punter for the 2007 season, partially due to his performance in the Chick-fil-A Bowl.|$|E
5000|$|An {{aggressive}} {{variation of}} the man-to-man system is known at the [...] "ten man ride". In this system, the riding team's goalie {{will come out of}} the goal to cover an attackman, allowing a defenseman to cover a midfielder, which in turn allows a midfielder to cover a defenseman, and finally one of the attackmen to cover the goalie. The danger in this system is that it is possible that none of the clearing midfielders will cross the mid-field line, so that the defenseman {{will not be able to}} stay <b>onsides</b> and cover him (remember, teams must always have 4 players on their defensive side of the field). It is also possible that the clearing team may catch the goalie out of the cage, and be able to take an open shot. This riding system is often used when a team is down and needs to recover the ball to catch up.|$|R
5000|$|However, the Cowboys {{lost to the}} Oilers in {{overtime}} (The Cowboys were driving close to field goal range in the overtime period when Emmitt Smith committed a rare fumble). The next week, they lost at the Giants in a game Jimmy Johnson said was [...] "officiated as poorly" [...] as any he had ever coached in. At 6-5, the playoff chances seemed in serious jeopardy, especially with their upcoming opponent being a road game against the undefeated (and eventual super bowl champion) Washington Redskins. However, Jimmy Johnson presented a gambling game plan for the Redskins game (including a first-half <b>onsides</b> kick, several decisions to [...] "go for it" [...] on 4th down at unusual times, and opting to throw for the end zone on the final play {{of the first half}} even though the team was within field goal range at the Redskins 34. Alvin Harper made the catch for a TD). The gambling game plan worked and the Cowboys completed a titanic 24-21 upset of the Redskins. Troy Aikman was injured in the Redskins game and was replaced early in the 2nd half by Steve Beuerlein (who had been signed late in the pre-season so as to avoid the problems at backup QB that plagued the Cowboys late in the 1990 season).|$|R
50|$|The 2-2 Eagles met the 3-1 Dallas Cowboys {{and fell}} to them 23-21, their first loss to Dallas since 1999. Andy Reid tried an opening kickoff <b>onsides</b> kick, which had helped spark the Eagles' 2000 season opening route of Dallas, but the Cowboys' new coach, Bill Parcells, was not fooled and the gamble blew up in Philadelphia's face. Randal Williams fielded the {{bouncing}} kick and raced {{into the end zone}} untouched in three seconds - the fastest touchdown in NFL history. Brian Westbrook's five-yard touchdown run in the second quarter tied the score, but Billy Cundiff kicked a field goal just before halftime to make it 10-7 Dallas. Troy Hambrick finished a third quarter Dallas drive with a one-yard touchdown to open a 17-7 Cowboy lead. A 52-yard catch-and-run by Duce Staley on the Eagles' ensuing drive brought Philadelphia within three points, but the Cowboys answered back with another field goal. With less than five minutes left to play, Correll Buckhalter broke free for a 20-yard touchdown run, giving Philadelphia a 21-20 lead. A long kick return helped set up Dallas' go-ahead field goal. Donovan McNabb, who struggled mightily throughout the game with a thumb injury, could not advance the team into field goal range after James Thrash returned the kickoff to midfield. Westbrook, Staley, and Buckhalter combined for over 100 rushing yards and three touchdowns. The loss dropped Philadelphia to 2-3 and a repeat of a division title appeared in doubt.|$|R
5|$|Jud Dunlevy {{kicked the}} ball, which {{traveled}} the regulation 10yards, but was recovered by Kansas. The Hokies, despite failing {{to recover the}} <b>onside</b> kick, still had a chance for another offensive possession if they stopped Kansas' offense short of a first down. Because the Hokies had two timeouts remaining, they could stop the clock after two Kansas plays, thus preserving time for a Virginia Tech offensive drive. An 11-yard pass by Todd Reesing netted Kansas a first down, however, and subsequent runs by the Jayhawks allowed Kansas to run out the clock despite the Virginia Tech timeouts. Kansas preserved its lead by kneeling on the ball inside the Virginia Tech 5-yard line on the final plays of the game, and the 2421 victory was celebrated as time ran out.|$|E
5|$|On Monday Night Football {{against the}} {{defending}} champion Buccaneers, Manning and the Colts trailed 35–14 in the final five minutes. After one short touchdown drive, the Colts recovered the <b>onside</b> kick. Manning threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Marvin Harrison on 4th & 6 to make it 35–28. With 1:41 remaining, Manning got the ball back and drove the offense 85 yards for the game-tying touchdown. He set up the winning 29-yard field goal in overtime for a stunning 38–35 win. It {{was the only time}} in NFL history a team won a game after trailing by 21 points in the final 4 minutes of regulation. Manning passed for 386 yards in the game.|$|E
5|$|The 1968 Liberty Bowl {{kicked off}} on January 14, 1968. As in the Hokies' {{previous}} Liberty Bowl appearance, Virginia Tech {{got off to}} a fast start. On the game's second play, Tech ran 58yards for a touchdown, courtesy of a trick play. After Mississippi fumbled, Tech recovered and scored another quick touchdown. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, Tech added a field goal to the two touchdowns it had already earned, making the score 17–0 at the end of one quarter. From that point onward, however, almost nothing would go in Virginia Tech's favor. Tech attempted an <b>onside</b> kick following the field goal, but were unable to successfully recover the ball. With good field position following the kick, Mississippi quarterback Archie Manning orchestrated a 49-yard drive for the Rebels' first points of the game.|$|E
50|$|The Eagles' {{season of}} high {{expectations}} {{began with a}} loss to the Tennessee Titans after the team blew a 24-10 halftime lead. The Titans scored on their first possession on 14-yard reception by Eddie George. Philadelphia took advantage of a muffed punt to extend a drive and scored on an 18-yard touchdown pass to James Thrash. The Eagles then executed a successful <b>onsides</b> kick and running back Duce Staley found the end zone on a 7-yard pass. Following a Tennessee field goal, the Eagles scored again {{early in the second}} quarter on an 11-play drive when Donovan McNabb completed his third touchdown pass - this one for 7 yards to Chad Lewis. A fumble recovery by the Philadelphia defense allowed a field goal before halftime to make the score 24-10 Eagles. Unfortunately, the Eagles offense and defense would go cold in the second half and the Titans would dominate the rest of the game. Joe Nedney kicked a 47-yard field goal for Tennessee, and the Eagles punted after a 15-play drive. Steve McNair completed his second touchdown pass early in the fourth quarter (the two-point conversion failed) and it was now 24-19. On Tennessee's next drive, McNair drove the Titans down the field and Eddie George punched it in from 2 yards out with 3:12 to play. The two-point conversion succeeded and Philadelphia now trailed 27-24. The Eagles' offense got two more chances, but failed to score. McNabb had two interceptions to go with his three touchdowns. Rookie Brian Westbrook, playing in his first game, led the team with 42 rushing yards on 8 carries.|$|R
50|$|In {{front of}} a Kansas City record 52,424 fans the Wizards beat English Superclub Manchester United. Peter Vermes kept the same {{starting}} eleven who had sparked the recent good form and it paid dividends immediately as the Wizards pressured high and got stuck in versus the Red Devils. In just the eleventh minute the home side would push ahead as Davy Arnaud was kept <b>onsides</b> by a lazy and slow moving Rafael and he easily tallied past backup Ben Amos. Like {{they had in the}} opening moments the club would keep creating serious chances throughout the first half with Teal Bunbury, Kei Kamara, and Englishman Ryan Smith all having good goes of it. While the Wizards were creating chances United was countering with only half chances until Jimmy Nielsen stopped a point blank attempt with his belly and the Wizards were forced onto their back foot, which is where they found themselves in the 39th minute when Ryan Giggs slipped Dimitar Berbatov between the KC centerbacks. Jimmy Conrad found himself a full step behind and {{on the wrong side of}} the Bulgarian striker but still made a play for the ball, he got man instead and the penalty was given by American Referee Terry Vaughn- who also gave Conrad an ejection. Berbatov's hesitation step sent Nielsen diving the wrong direction and he easily equalized the exhibition match. Just one minute later Kansas City's leading assist maker Smith crossed a corner into and off of leading scorer Kamara's head that gave the now ten man home side the lead once again. Manchester United fought for the equalizer playing all their starters until the 68th minute and Alex Ferguson decided to even keep playing Giggs and fellow Red Devil legend Paul Scholes the full 90 minutes but the Major League Soccer outfit held their lines and won the match 2-1.|$|R
5|$|The Bulls {{proceeded}} {{to lose their}} next three games. Buffalo was unable {{to keep up with}} No.5-ranked Missouri, losing 42–21 in a game that Missouri saw as a tuneup for their later season. In the next contest, against MAC opponent Central Michigan, down ninepoints with under threeminutes left Buffalo scored on a 65-yard pass to James Starks, recovered an <b>onside</b> kick to retain possession, and attempted a game-winning field goal—but A.J. Principe's 46-yard kick hit the right goalpost to give Central Michigan the victory. In the next game, against the Western Michigan Broncos, also in the MAC, Buffalo squandered a two-touchdown advantage with just over five minutes left, allowing the Broncos to win the game in overtime. Buffalo's overall record fell to 2–4, 1–2 in the MAC.|$|E
