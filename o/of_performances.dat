40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyses}} {{determinants of}} public managers´ {{internal and external}} use <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> information. Using a sample of over 3100 top public sector executives in six European countries, we find evidence for significant country variations, with a more limited use <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> information in France and Germany. It was {{also found that the}} use <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> information is mainly determined by organizational factors rather than managers’ individual socio-demographic characteristics. The analysis also found considerable differences in patterns of use between policy fields and a lower use <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> indicators in central government ministries. Finally, the implementation <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> management instruments in an organization has an overall strong effect on the actual use <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> information...|$|R
40|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> {{indicators}} in {{the public}} sector has long been encouraged. However, recent research findings have suggested that performance measurement is seen to be problematical and the use and development <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> indicators is not as extensive as is thought possible. There has also been a questioning of the validity of the rationalist model <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> measurement and {{it has been suggested that}} there are alternative models. This paper examines: 1) the extent of the use <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> indicators in Vietonan local government; 2) the possible barriers to their use; 3) models <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> measurement and; 4) the role of the implementation process in the development and use <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> indicators. The research is based on a questionnaire sent to all local govemments in Victoria and four case studies. The data reported in this paper is derived from councils that reported using program budgeting. The results of the research suggest that there is only a limited use <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> indicators by Victorian municipalities. The alternative models <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> measurement appear to be in evidence. The findings indicate that the implementation process is an important factor in the development and use <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> indicators...|$|R

This research was carried out in the Local Government of East Sumba Regency. The research respondents were the government officers of Echelon II, III, and IV.

40|$|Performance {{measurement}} {{has gained}} significant importance around the world. Many governments are adopting performance measurement {{as a part}} of reform efforts. Despite the widespread practitioner attention, academic studies are inconclusive about the impact <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> measurement in the public sector. Moreover, while studies have examined what factors influence the adoption <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> measures and its impact, they have paid relatively less attention to the use of different types <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> measures. To fill this gap, this study examines: (1) what types <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> measures are collected by US local governments and; (2) how organizational, technical, and external factors influence the collection <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> measurement. Leveraging survey data, we conduct cluster analysis and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to study factors that impact the collection <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> measures. The findings of QCA highlight that no single condition dominates the collection <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> measurement, rather different combinations of organizational and external factors influence the outcome.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUNDThe {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> {{indicators that}} enable benchmarking between organizations {{is an important}} mechanism for accountability, organizational learning, and performance improvement. In the province of Quebec (Canada), 21 rehabilitation organizations developed a common set <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> indicators through interorganizational collaboration. PURPOSEThe aims {{of this study were}} to describe the rehabilitation organizations' use of a common set <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> indicators and to identify the factors influencing such use. APPROACHA qualitative survey was performed. Individual semistructured interviews were conducted with executives (n = 18) working at 16 rehabilitation organizations using a common set <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> indicators. A thematic analysis of the factors of use was performed according to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. The use <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> indicators was categorized as purposeful, political, or passive. FINDINGSOur results showed that all organizations used the common set <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> indicators. Four factors were identified as important to all the rehabilitation organizations to explain their interest in comparative performance indicators: the need to develop their own performance indicators, the compatibility <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> information with organizational needs, complexity/simplicity <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> information, and the support offered by their common association. Sixty-three percent of rehabilitation organizations made purposeful or political use <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> indicators. Three main factors contributed to typify those organizations from the others: the perceived quality <b>of</b> the <b>performance</b> indicators, the leadership of decision makers, and the resources available.
