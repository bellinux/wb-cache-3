50|$|The {{main points}} of this {{argument}} can be summarised as follows:*a mass of evidence indicating that reductions in hours of work had not led to proportionate declines in output;*modern industry fatigue was less physical in nature and more a combination of psychological and physiological {{as a result of}} specialisation and increased need for mental concentration;*the reduction of hours allowed better-rested workers to produce as much or more in the shorter hours;*the total value of the output would initially rise as the working day increased but eventually the total output as well as the <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> would decline as the working day became so long that it prevented adequate recovery from fatigue for workers;*this is the case because, beyond a certain point, each additional hour of work would be contributing to the output of the current day's total output but {{at the expense of the}} following day's output capacity; and*the intensity of the work involved would dictate the point at which total output begins to fall and thus the length of the 'optimal' working day.The second half {{of this argument}} explores whether the free market can arrive at the 'optimal' length of day, and can be summarised as follows:*the maintenance of a long-term optimum by employers would require short-term restraint;*each individual employer could never be certain of reaping the benefit of their restraint as another firm could potentially entice the employer's well-rested workers away with a wage premium;*therefore the optimal output work time is a form of investment without equity;*simultaneously, Chapman (1909) assumed that workers would choose a longer working day than was prudent (although not as long as the working day preferred by employers), primarily because of a general short-sightedness that would mean workers would consider their immediate earning capacity more than their longterm earning capacity; and*the outcome in a free market situation would therefore be one where employers and employees acting in self-interest would each tend to select a working day that was longer than the 'optimal' hours.Chapman (1909) considered three elements in gauging the optimal day for the worker; # the wage, # the marginal value of leisure and # the disutility of work.|$|E

Executive summary In {{one of his first}} major steps as Prime Minister, Tony Abbott has delivered on his promise to establish a Commission of Audit into the Commonwealth public sector. The exercise is in the image of similar commissions called by incoming Premiers in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The Commission will find, as its state counterparts have done, that the public sector exhibits poor productivity and should be reduced in size, with important services to be outsourced to the private sector. That this finding can be predicted so confidently in advance should raise questions over its validity.

Kehoe, University of Minnesota Professor Ramon Marimon, European University Institute Professor Franck Portier, Toulouse School of Economics. This thesis {{contributes}} to the literature emphasizing the role of incomplete financial markets for the design of macroeconomic policies. I use two main frameworks for my analysis: In a small open economy model with default risk and incomplete markets, I study two questions addressing how predictions for optimal fiscal policy over the business cycle change in the presence of borrowing constraints. I use a standard incomplete markets model with heterogeneous agents to assess how government policies can alleviate the welfare losses caused by financial frictions. In the first chapter I argue that government spending can optimally be procyclical when governments cannot borrow in recessions. I decompose total expenditure into public goods and social spending and show that the latter component is crucial in driving this result. Furthermore, I show that higher income inequality exacerbates the welfare losses from conducting countercyclical policies without financial market access. The second chapter of this thesis is joint work with C. Gottlieb. We analyze to which extent a simple redistributive policy in the form of transfers can alleviate the welfare losses caused by frictional insurance markets. We find that targeting transfers towards low income households improves welfare, but reduces <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>hours</b> worked. Redistribution is more effective, and welfare is higher than under lumpsum transfers at low tax rates. In the third chapter, I study the role of spending rules on optimal tax policy in a small open economy with a government that lacks commitment to repay its external debt. I find that neither pro- nor countercyclical policy rules qualitatively change the predictions for optimal tax policy...|$|R
