5|$|Alberta uses a unicameral Westminster-style {{parliamentary}} government, {{in which}} the premier {{is the leader of}} the party that controls the most seats in the Legislative Assembly. The premier is Alberta's head of government, while the Queen of Canada in right of Alberta is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta. The premier picks a cabinet, usually from the elected members of the Legislative Assembly, to form the Executive Council of Alberta, and presides <b>over</b> <b>that</b> body.|$|E
5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in {{the same}} manner as a tree's trunk. The cells beneath the epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like a tree. However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe <b>over</b> <b>that</b> of a woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height in order to support itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E

Amid negotiations <b>over</b> <b>that</b> issue, Arnold wrote out a letter of resignation on July 11, the same day that word arrived in Philadelphia, that Fort Ticonderoga had fallen to the British.

A number of proposals were submitted– at one stage, a twin-Spey design was considered, then rejected. Following the Labour government's coming to power the project was cancelled in 1965. The Royal Navy would acquire the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, while the RAF continued to foster development of the P.1127(RAF), leading to the successful Harrier Jump Jet family.|$|E
