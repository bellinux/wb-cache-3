40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) is an {{association}} of industry representatives, and state, territorial, provincial, and federal government officials in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The CVSA's goal is to improve commercial vehicle safety. The CVSA concentrates its safety focus on three areas; driver, vehicle, and hazardous materials. Since 1981, the CVSA has developed a set of criteria {{for each of the}} three areas that define conditions which are so unsafe that a truck and/or driver should not be allowed to operate. These criteria are known as <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> (<b>OOS)</b> criteria. To check the compliance of motor carriers with the CVSA criteria, a series of road side inspections is conducted by state and local governments. If the driver and/or vehicle are found in violation of the CVSA OOS criteria, they are placed "out of service" until the conditions are completely remedied. Due to criteria growth, the CVSA wanted to examine the OOS criteria in the vehicle and hazardous materials areas. This study, focused on the vehicle portion of the OOS criteria, attempted to correlate commercial vehicle defects to commercial vehicle accidents. For a major portion of this project, actual accident reports from six states of the United States were evaluated. The states and reports were selected via a stratified two stage cluster sampling system. The results were used to form estimates of the proportion and number of commercial vehicle accidents in the United States with a mechanical defect as a contributing factor. In addition to the accident report sampling, other sources were used to establish a correlation between vehicle defects and commercial vehicle accidents. They include literature, national databases, and post-crash inspections. Results from this study show that approximately 4. 6...|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} demand to extend object-oriented middleware to support applications with stringent quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> (QoS) requirements. However, conventional object-oriented middleware does not define standard features for specifying or enforcing end-to-end QoS for applications with deterministic or statistical real-time requirements. This paper focuses on strategies for integrating I/O subsystems with object-oriented middleware to produce ORB endsystems for statically scheduled real-time applications. Keywords: Real-time CORBA, Object Request Broker, Quality <b>of</b> <b>Service,</b> <b>OO</b> Middleware, I/O Subsystem 1 Introduction Existing Object Request Broker (ORB) middleware like CORBA [1], DCOM [2], and Java RMI [3] {{is suitable for}} request /response applications with best-effort quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> requirements. However, existing ORB middleware is not yet suited for performance-sensitive, distributed real-time applications due to (1) lack of QoS specification interfaces, (2) lack of QoS enfo [...] ...|$|R
