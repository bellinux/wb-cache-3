50|$|Setun (Сетунь) was a {{computer}} developed in 1958 at Moscow State University. It was built {{under the leadership}} of Sergei Sobolev and Nikolay Brusentsov. It was the most modern ternary computer, using the balanced ternary numeral system and three-valued ternary logic instead of the two-valued binary logic prevalent in other computers. The computer was built to fulfill the needs of Moscow State University. It was manufactured at the Kazan Mathematical plant. Fifty computers were built from 1959 and production was halted in 1965. The characteristic <b>operating</b> <b>memory</b> consisted of 81 words of memory, each word composed of 18 trits (ternary digits) with additional 1944 words on magnetic drum (total of about 7 KB). Between 1965 and 1970, a regular binary computer was used at Moscow State University to replace it. Although this replacement binary computer performed equally well, it had 2.5 times the cost of the Setun. In 1970, a new ternary computer architecture, the Setun-70, was developed; it was implemented only {{in the form of a}} simulator program running on a binary computer.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} two major research areas in safety-critical software systems, namely, software analysis, and software implementation. In {{reference to the}} software analysis problem, the main contribution of the dissertation {{is the development of}} a novel framework, based on Lyapunov invariants and convex optimization, for verification of various safety and performance specifications for software systems. The enabling elements of the framework for software analysis are: (i) dynamical system interpretation and modeling of computer programs,(ii) Lyapunov invariants as behavior certificates for computer programs, and (iii) a computa-tional procedure for finding the Lyapunov invariants. (i) The view in this dissertation is that software defines a rule for iterative modification of the <b>operating</b> <b>memory</b> at discrete instances of time. Hence, it can be modeled as a discrete-time dynamical system with the program variables as the state variables, and the <b>operating</b> <b>memory</b> as the state space.

40|$|In this paper, local cubic quasi-interpolating splines on {{non-uniform}} grids are described. The splines {{are designed}} by fast computational algorithms that utilize {{the relation between}} splines and cubic interpolation polynomials. These splines provide an efficient tool for real-time signal processing. As an input, the splines use either clean or noised arbitrarily-spaced samples. Formulas for the spline’s extrapolation beyond the sampling interval are established. Sharp estimations of the approximation errors are presented. The capability to adapt the grid {{to the structure of}} an object and to have minimal requirements to the <b>operating</b> <b>memory</b> are of great advantages for offline processing of signals and multidimensional data arrays. The designed splines serve as a source for generating real-time wavelet transforms to apply to signals in scenarios where the signal’s samples subsequently arrive one after the other at random times. The wavelet transforms are executed by six-tap weighted moving averages of the signal’s samples without delay. On arrival of new samples, only a couple of adjacent transform coefficients are updated in a way that no boundary effects arise...|$|E

Female Wistar rats were studied in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) and locomotor activity test. Rats undergoing the MWM and locomotor activity test were injected with saline on day 1, 7, 14 and 21 of testing. Results showed a statistically significant mobility increase in the group of ethanol‑exposed females (CEt) (21 days) compared to the non‑ethanol‑exposed group (CNEt). Upon ARI administration to CEt, no statistically significant differences in animal mobility were found, either upon single or chronic administration. Chronic administration of FLU (21 days) as well as combined administration of ARI+FLU (14 and 21 days) caused a statistically significant reduction of the females' mobility compared to the control CEt group. Single and chronic administration of ARI (7 x) both show a spatial memory improvement in CEt. No memory improvement was observed, however, after 14 and 21 days of ARI administration. FLU, likewise, improved spatial memory both upon single and chronic administration. Combined administration of ARI+FLU improved memory in CEt only upon single administration. Lack of effect upon chronic administration may be due to tolerance to memory improvement developing upon combined administration of ARI+FLU. It can be concluded that ARI (1. 5 mg/kg), FLU (5 mg/kg), and combined administration of these drugs improves spatial memory in CEt...|$|E
