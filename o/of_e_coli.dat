5|$|A common {{subdivision}} system <b>of</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli,</b> but {{not based on}} evolutionary relatedness, is by serotype, {{which is based on}} major surface antigens (O antigen: part of lipopolysaccharide layer; H: flagellin; K antigen: capsule), e.g. O157:H7). It is, however, common to cite only the serogroup, i.e. the O-antigen. At present, about 190 serogroups are known. The common laboratory strain has a mutation that prevents the formation of an O-antigen and is thus not typeable.|$|E

40|$|Aims: The {{relationships}} between the b-D-glucuronidase (GLUase) activity, the abundance of culturable Escherichia coli and the number <b>of</b> viable <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> were investigated in river and wastewater samples. Methods and Results: GLUase activity was measured as the rate of hydrolysis of 4 -methylumbelliferyl-b-Dglucuronide. Culturable <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> were enumerated by the most probale number (MPN) microplate method. Viable <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> were estimated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) coupled with a procedure of viability testing (DVC-FISH procedure). Significant correlations {{were found between the}} log of GLUase activity and both, the log culturable <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> and the log <b>of</b> viable <b>E.</b> <b>coli.</b> Conclusions: GLUase activity per viable <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> gave a broadly constant value from low to highly contaminated waters while GLUase activity per culturable <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strongly increased at low contaminated waters because of an underestimation of the number <b>of</b> active <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> by the culture-based method. Significance and Impact of the Study: GLUase activity is a reliable parameter for the rapid quantification <b>of</b> viable <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> in waters.

5|$|A {{large number}} of strains {{belonging}} to this species have been isolated and characterised. In addition to serotype (vide supra), they can be classified according to their phylogeny, i.e. the inferred evolutionary history, as shown below where the species is divided into six groups. Particularly the use of whole genome sequences yields highly supported phylogenies. Based on such data, five subspecies <b>of</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> were distinguished.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{and related}} {{bacteria}} possess {{the ability to}} transfer DNA via bacterial conjugation or transduction, which allows genetic material to spread horizontally through an existing population. The process of transduction, which uses the bacterial virus called a bacteriophage, is where {{the spread of the}} gene encoding for the Shiga toxin from the Shigella bacteria to E. coli helped produce , the Shiga toxin-producing strain <b>of</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli.</b>|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{from the}} {{evolutionary}} point of view, {{the members of}} genus Shigella (S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei) should be classified as E. coli strains, a phenomenon termed taxa in disguise. Similarly, other strains <b>of</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> (e.g. the K-12 strain commonly used in recombinant DNA work) are sufficiently different that they would merit reclassification.|$|E

5|$|Bacteria {{affecting}} {{the water quality}} mainly consist {{of different types of}} fecal coliforms, with a high level <b>of</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> bacteria. This comes from pet waste, fertilizer, manure, and other organic pollutants that are washed into the creek, raising the average bacteria level 34percent higher than levels declared safe under California law. This in turn affects recreation at popular Aliso Creek Beach at the creek's mouth, violating state swimming standards 99percent of the time, especially during storm events, as beachgoers are warned to avoid the creek for 72hours (3days) after a major storm event.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{encompasses}} {{an enormous}} population of bacteria that exhibit {{a very high}} degree of both genetic and phenotypic diversity. Genome sequencing {{of a large number}} of isolates <b>of</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> and related bacteria shows that a taxonomic reclassification would be desirable. However, this has not been done, largely due to its medical importance, and E. coli remains one of the most diverse bacterial species: only 20% of the genes in a typical E. coli genome is shared among all strains.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} evolution experiments using E. coli, {{begun by}} Richard Lenski in 1988, have allowed direct observation of major evolutionary {{shifts in the}} laboratory.

In this experiment, one population <b>of</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> unexpectedly evolved the ability to aerobically metabolize citrate, possibly marking a speciation event observed in the laboratory.|$|E

40|$|ESBL-producing {{bacteria}} {{are present in}} wildlife and the environment might serve as a resistance reservoir. Wild gulls {{have been described as}} frequent carriers <b>of</b> ESBL-producing <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strains with genotypic characteristics similar to strains found in humans. Therefore, potential dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria between the human population and wildlife need to be further investigated. Occurrence and characterization <b>of</b> ESBL-producing <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> in Swedish wild gulls were assessed and compared to isolates from humans, livestock and surface water collected in the same country and similar time-period. Occurrence <b>of</b> ESBL-producing <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> in Swedish gulls is about three times higher in gulls compared to Swedish community carriers (17 % versus 5 %) and the genetic characteristics <b>of</b> the ESBL-producing <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> population in Swedish wild gulls and Swedish human are similar. ESBL-plasmids IncF- and IncI 1 -type carrying ESBL-genes blaCTX-M- 15 or blaCTX-M- 14 were most common in isolates from both gulls and humans, but there was limited evidence of clonal transmission. Isolates from Swedish surface water harbored similar genetic characteristics, which highlights surface waters as potential dissemination routes between wildlife and the human population. Even in a low-prevalence country such as Sweden, the occurrence <b>of</b> ESBL producing <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> in wild gulls and the human population appears to be connected and the occurrence <b>of</b> ESBL-producing <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> in Swedish gulls is likely a case of environmental pollution...|$|R

5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains <b>of</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E
5|$|Like all lifeforms, new strains <b>of</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> evolve {{through the}} natural {{biological}} processes of mutation, gene duplication, and horizontal gene transfer; in particular, 18% {{of the genome}} of the laboratory strain MG1655 was horizontally acquired since the divergence from Salmonella.

These virulent strains typically cause a bout of diarrhea that is often self-limiting in healthy adults but is frequently lethal to children in the developing world. More virulent strains, such as , cause serious illness or death in the elderly, the very young, or the immunocompromised.|$|E
5|$|Optimum growth <b>of</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> {{occurs at}} 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E

40|$|Background/purposeThe {{relationship}} between fluoroquinolone resistance in Escherichia coli isolates causing nosocomial infection and hospital antibiotic consumption were investigated. Restriction of levofloxacin use was implemented {{to control the}} incidence <b>of</b> fluoroquinolone-resistant <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> in the hospital. MethodsThe study was conducted from January 2004 to December 2010. Antimicrobial agent consumption {{was obtained from the}} pharmacy computer system and presented as the defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days every 6 months. The incidence <b>of</b> fluoroquinolone-resistant <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> isolates causing nosocomial infections was obtained from the Department of Infection Control every 6 months. An antimicrobial stewardship program, restricting levofloxacain use, was implemented in July 2007. ResultsThe incidence <b>of</b> fluoroquinolone-resistant <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> causing nosocomial infections was significantly correlated with fluoroquinolone usage (p =  0. 005), but not with the use of third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or carbapenems. Parenteral (p =  0. 002), oral (p =  0. 018), and total levofloxacin (p =  0. 001) use were significantly correlated with the extent of fluoroquinolone resistance. With a reduction of levofloxacin use, a decrease of the incidence of fluoroquinolone resistance in <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> isolates was observed.
