The squadron started operating this pod in mid 1990 {{as one of the first}} USAF squadrons to deploy it in an <b>operational</b> <b>environment.</b> With tensions rising in the Middle East the squadron had to adopt this new weapon system very quickly and had to train in very different scenarios then previously flown in a couple of months time.|$|E
25|$|From September 1953 onwards, {{both the}} Avro 720 and the SR.53 {{projects}} were subject increasingly levels of scrutiny amid an overall requirement within the Ministry to implement cuts {{in order to}} reduce costs. However, the Avro 720 was dealt an effective death blow when the Screamer rocket engine which powered the interceptor was cancelled during late 1956. Reportedly, official concerns regarding the practicality of using liquid oxygen, which boils at -183°C (90 K) and is a fire hazard, within an <b>operational</b> <b>environment</b> had heavily contributed to the Screamer's cancellation. The loss of the main engine in turn ultimately led to the termination of the Avro 720. One {{of the reasons for the}} Ministry's preferment of the SR.53, despite its development programme being comparatively behind and having suffered greater delays, was its rocket engine's use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidiser had been viewed as less problematic than the Screamer's liquid oxygen oxidiser, and the Ministry did not want to support two separate rocket fuel programmes.|$|E
25|$|The {{changing}} nature of land warfare during the Second World War led to {{significant changes in the}} composition of Australian Army units. The success of German mechanised units during the invasions of Poland and France convinced Australian defence planners that the Army required armoured units, and these began to be raised in 1941 when the 1st Armoured Division was formed. The two Militia cavalry divisions were first motorised and then converted into armoured divisions in 1942 and the 3rd Army Tank Brigade was formed to provide support to the infantry. However, in response to the growing Japanese threat Australian forces were concentrated in the South West Pacific Area and between 1942 and early 1943 the divisions of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) had fought using the standard British Army organisation they had adopted during previous campaigns in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East fighting the Germans and Italians in 1940 and 1941, while the Milita divisions used a 1941 Australian organisation which included a headquarters company, four rifle companies and a machine-gun company in each infantry battalion. Yet the early campaigns suggested that the existing organisation was unsuitable for jungle warfare {{and as a result of}} the changing <b>operational</b> <b>environment</b> in February 1943 Land Headquarters identified the need for three different types of division: armoured divisions, standard infantry divisions and jungle infantry divisions.|$|E

500|$|Aware of the {{changing}} <b>operational</b> <b>environment,</b> the Ministry of Supply started work with English Electric in 1955, attempting to define a new light bomber to replace the Canberra. These early studies eventually settled on an aircraft with a [...] ferry range, Mach 1.5 speed [...] "at altitude" [...] and [...] low-level range. A crew of two was required, one being the operator of the advanced navigational and attack equipment. The bombload was to be four 1,000lb (450kg) bombs.|$|E
500|$|The Sea Harriers were {{outnumbered by}} the {{available}} Argentinian aircraft, and were on occasion decoyed {{away by the}} activities of the Escuadrón Fénix or civilian jet aircraft used by the Argentine Air Force. They had to operate without a fleet early warning system such as AWACS that would have been available to a full NATO fleet in which the Royal Navy had expected to operate, which was a significant weakness in the <b>operational</b> <b>environment.</b> However, it is now known that British units based in Chile did provide early radar warning to the Task Force. [...] The result was that the Sea Harriers could not establish complete air superiority and prevent Argentine attacks during day or night, nor could they completely stop the daily C-130 Hercules transports' night flights to the islands. [...] A total of six Sea Harriers were lost during the war to either enemy fire, accidents, or mechanical failure. The total aggregate loss rate for both the Harriers and Sea Harriers on strike operations was 2.3%.|$|E

According to Roberto J. Gonzalez (Associate Professor of Anthropology at San Jose State University, {{and one of the}} most vocal critics of HTS), this concept can be traced back to a 1968 report by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) about [...] "the perceived threat of the Black Panthers and other militant groups". He argues that the concept gradually gained in popularity and usage, in the military and elsewhere, through the writing of military officials, such as Ralph Peters, and pundits, such as Max Boot.|$|E
2500|$|A further {{modification}} to {{the boiler}} design {{has been the}} use of hollow stays. The stays support and separate the outer boiler and inner firebox.

Leaks have in fact been detected and have led to the locomotive being unavailable for service. In July 2010 while replacement stays were fitted, Mark Allatt, chairman, The A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, commented [...] "Although the problems with Tornado’s boiler are part of learning about the locomotive in today’s <b>operational</b> <b>environment,</b> they are a source of great disappointment to all of Tornado's supporters and customers and our customers' passengers.
