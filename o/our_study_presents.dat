SPECT/CT, as a combined metabolical/anatomical imaging modality, is methodically impaired concerning soft tissue evaluation, e.g., tendons, sheaths, as well as fibrous tissue.

In a first time, the degradation level of process was established by a "classical" degradation laws (statistical laws).

We conducted a four-phase study, with 27 students, to explore the practices surrounding the creation, interpretation and sharing of map annotations in specific social contexts. We found that annotation authors consider multiple factors when deciding how to annotate maps, including the perceived utility to the audience and how their contributions will reflect on the image they project to others. Consumers of annotations value the novelty of information, but must be convinced of the author’s credibility. In this paper we describe <b>our</b> <b>study,</b> <b>present</b> the results, and discuss implications for the design of software for sharing map annotations...|$|R

Finally, most patients received an antifibrotic treatment (pirfenidone or nintedanib) during the follow-up period, which may change their clinical evolution and influence correlations with baseline PET/CT values. These limitations could perhaps explain the lack of correlation found between SUV values (corrected or uncorrected for lung density) and patients’ functional and clinical evolution at 1 year.|$|E
