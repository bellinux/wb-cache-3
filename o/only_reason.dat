5|$|Grace's (Debra Messing) {{pregnancy}} prompts Karen (Megan Mullally) {{to have a}} baby of her own. She pays a surrogate, Cricket (Wanda Sykes), {{to carry}} her child. Grace, who is bewildered at the idea of Karen having a baby, suspects that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> is that she is having one. Karen, however, dismisses the idea. Meanwhile, Cricket begins to have second thoughts on becoming Karen's surrogate, following Karen's strange behavior towards her and Karen's admission on how she and her husband, Stanley, will raise the child. This prompts Cricket to quit and Karen revealing to Grace that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> she wanted a baby was to help her marriage. She also admits that she has thought about leaving her husband.|$|E
5|$|At a New Year's Eve {{party that}} year, Sally feels alone without Harry by her side. Harry spends New Year's alone, {{walking around the}} city. As Sally decides to leave the party early, Harry appears and {{declares}} his love for her. She argues that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> he is there is because he is lonely, but he lists the many things he realized he loves about her. They kiss and marry three months later.|$|E

5|$|Braun was {{a member}} of Hoffman's staff when she {{attended}} the Nuremberg Rally {{for the first time in}} 1935. Hitler's half-sister, Angela Raubal (the dead Geli's mother), took exception to her presence there, and was later dismissed from her position as housekeeper at his house in Berchtesgaden. Researchers are unable to ascertain if her dislike for Braun was the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> for her departure, but other members of Hitler's entourage saw Braun as untouchable from then on.|$|E
5|$|Few fossils {{have been}} found in the Ringbone Formation, the only {{significant}} one being a specimen that is either Albertosaurus sp. or Daspletosaurus sp., known from a tooth and vertebrae. The <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> the Ringbone Formation is assigned to the Kirtlandian age is because the rocks are the same age as the Fort Crittenden Formation, which contains one of the index taxa of the Kirtlandian.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Sunni Muslims were Arab nationalists, but not Ba'athist, making them feel alienated. The party was chiefly dominated by minority {{groups such as}} Alawites, Druzes, and Isma'ilis, and people from the countryside in general; this created an urban–rural conflict based predominantly on ethnic differences. With its coming to power, the Ba'ath Party was threatened by the predominantly anti-Ba'athist sentiment in urban politics—probably the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> why the Ba'athists managed {{to stay in power}} was the rather weakly organised and fragmented opposition it faced.|$|E

40|$|In this Article, James Madigan {{examines}} {{the role of}} public reason in a democratic government, including what views should {{play a role in}} determining public reason. Madigan criticizes John Rawls for including comprehensive views in constitutional debates, and argues that <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> grounded in political values should be used when debating constitutional issues and fundamental rights...|$|R
5|$|The {{second section}} {{discusses}} disorder within nature, which is opposite {{to the discussion}} of order within nature found in the second section of Burnt Norton. Also, rational knowledge itself is described as being inadequate for explaining reality. Those who pursue <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> and science are ignorant. Even our progress is not progress {{as we continue to}} repeat the same errors as the past.|$|E
5|$|Warren {{convened a}} meeting of the justices, and {{presented}} to them the simple argument that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> to sustain segregation was an honest belief in the inferiority of Negroes. Warren further submitted that the Court must overrule Plessy to maintain its legitimacy as an institution of liberty, and it must do so unanimously to avoid massive Southern resistance. He began to build a unanimous opinion.|$|E
5|$|Apollo tells Veronica that he {{actually}} does want the paternity test. Dick’s father, {{who was involved in}} a corporate crime, appears and berates him for going on the surfing trip in the summer. Apollo takes the paternity test, but the father doesn’t appear. However, Apollo informs Veronica that {{he actually}} was a child soldier, enlisting his former roommate to tell her that he wasn’t so that he could ensure his father was genuinely loving. The <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> the father did not show up to the paternity test was that he was detained for having the wrong license plates. Apollo and the father meet at the Sheriff’s office, where they have an emotional reunion. Dick angrily confronts his father, but the next time he is seen, he calls off his trip with Logan. Logan tells Parker this news, and she is disappointed.|$|E

McManus said: [...] "I'm sorry I had to leave - the <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> I did so were for {{a greater degree of}} financial security so I can support my daughter, and to help progress my football career at a higher level." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fallacies that {{violate the}} {{relevance}} criterion. The relevance criterion requires that one who presents {{an argument for}} or against a position should attempt to set forth <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> that {{are directly related to}} the merit of the position at issue. Fallacies such as appeal to tradition, appeal to force, or genetic fallacy fail to meet the argumentative demands of relevance.|$|R
5000|$|In April the {{children}} of the Doe (real name withheld) family of KwaZulu-Natal have been removed from their parents by social workers for “not attending school”. The <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> given to the court were that {{the children}} were not attending schools and that their parents were allegedly [...] "indoctrinating" [...] the children with their religious beliefs. After this, the Pestalozzi Trust became involved.|$|R
5|$|Benchley {{continued}} to freelance, submitting humor columns {{to a variety}} of publications, including Life (where fellow humorist James Thurber stated that Benchley's columns were the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> the magazine was read). He continued meeting with his friends at the Algonquin, and the group became popularly known as the Algonquin Round Table. In April 1920, Benchley landed a position with Life writing theatre reviews, which he would continue doing regularly through 1929, eventually taking complete control of the drama section. His reviews were known for their flair, and he often used them as a soapbox for issues of concern to him, whether petty (people who cough during plays) or more important (such as racial intolerance).|$|E
5|$|Even though Lana {{eventually}} marries Lex {{in season}} six, Al Gough argues that Lana still loved Clark and Clark still loved her. The <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> Lana was with Lex was because Clark forced {{her in that}} direction and she ended up getting in over her head. By contrast, writer Caroline Dries feels that Lana did love Lex, and {{that she did not}} make any hasty decisions when she agreed to marry him. Dries believes that the progression of the show demonstrates that Lex earned Lana's love. To answer viewers that hated to see Lana marry Lex, Dries contends that as viewers we are seeing all of Lex, including how evil he truly is, while Lana only sees the portion of Lex that appears good.|$|E
5|$|Henry II's biographer, the {{historian}} W. L. Warren, suggests that Hilary was pressed {{to bring the}} case against Battle Abbey by his cathedral chapter, and that Hilary did not pursue the case vigorously. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting, sees {{the case against the}} abbey as the lone exception in Hilary's long career of support for the royal position against the papacy, and argues that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> Hilary opposed the king in this respect was that it was Hilary's own rights as a diocesan bishop that were being flouted. Mayr-Harting also suggests that Theobald of Bec was supporting Hilary's efforts to assert Chichester's rights.|$|E
5000|$|Older {{products}} {{may still}} be available from retailers, though these cards have black borders and different backs. Official tournaments {{so far have been}} [...] "white border only", so {{it is not necessary to}} chase down the older cards. The <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> to do so are for fun or to complete a collection, though if intended for play, sleeves are required to disguise the different backs.|$|R
25|$|Critics see {{the change}} in {{calendar}} as an unwarranted innovation, influenced by Western society. They say that no sound theological reason has been given for changing the calendar, that the <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> advanced are social. The proposal for change was introduced by Meletios Metaxakis, a patriarch whose canonical status has been disputed and who {{is alleged to have}} been a Freemason, which is forbidden by the Orthodox Church.|$|R
40|$|Economic {{motives are}} not the <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> for {{committing}} a (small) crime. People consider social norms and perceptions of fairness before judging a situation and acting upon it. If someone takes a bundle of printing paper from the office for private use at home, then a colleague who sees this can either report it or not: peer reporting. We investigate how fairness perception influences peer reporting in this situation of incorrect behavior. ...|$|R
5|$|His {{place in}} the genealogical {{tradition}} of the MacDonalds is the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> for believing in his existence, a genealogical tradition that not all historians have accepted. Beyond his actual existence, there is little that is certain. Three entries in Irish annals may discuss him, though he is never named; a praise poem surviving from the Early Modern period may be descended from a poem originally written for him; a miracle in a Manx chronicle {{may or may not}} have Domhnall as its subject; and a doubtful charter surviving from a similarly late era was allegedly issued by him.|$|E
5|$|Newton often openly mocked {{the captain}} by {{creating}} obscene poems and songs {{about him that}} became so popular the crew began to join in. He entered into disagreements with several colleagues that resulted in his being starved almost to death, imprisoned while at sea and chained like the slaves they carried, then outright enslaved and forced {{to work on a}} plantation in Sierra Leone near the Sherbro River. After several months he came to think of Sierra Leone as his home, but his father intervened after Newton sent him a letter describing his circumstances, and a ship found him by coincidence. Newton claimed the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> he left was because of Polly.|$|E
5|$|Reginald {{was elected}} Bishop of Bath in late April 1173, and was consecrated 23 June 1174. However, Henry the Young King {{challenged}} the election, {{on the grounds}} of illegitimacy and an uncanonical election. Reginald went to Rome in the company of Richard of Dover, who had just been elected Archbishop of Canterbury and was facing a challenge from the Young King to his election. Reginald was confirmed by Pope Alexander III on 18 April 1174 with Walter Map alleging bribery as the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> the election was confirmed. Ralph de Diceto, however, states that Reginald swore an oath that he was uninvolved in the death of Becket and that his birth took place before his father became a priest. During the dispute, Reginald's friend Peter of Blois wrote him a letter, which is still extant, encouraging him to persevere.|$|E
50|$|One {{interpretation}} of the Modigliani-Miller theorem is that taxes and regulation are the <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> for investors to care what kinds of securities firms issue, whether debt, equity, or something else. The theorem states that {{the structure of a}} firm's liabilities should have no bearing on its net worth (absent taxes, etc.). The securities may trade at different prices depending on their composition, but they must ultimately add up to the same value.|$|R
5000|$|The Attorney General, Sir Charles Russell {{attacked}} the City's attitude. The <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> {{he could see}} for resisting the merger were a misplaced pride {{in the office of}} Lord Mayor and a [...] "too sacred regard" [...] for the City funds. Following the receipt of a letter from the President of the Local Government Board the City agreed to resume tendering evidence in December on the understanding that the terms of reference could be modified.|$|R

5|$|The Original All Blacks {{introduced}} several innovations to rugby in France and the British Isles. At {{the time}} of their tour many critics in the Northern Hemisphere blamed the use of the wing–forward for the All Blacks success. These critics claimed this player—who fed the ball into the scrum—would obstruct opposition players, and that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> they were not being penalised was due to poor refereeing. Their success however was due to a combination of factors, the most important being the team's discipline and organisation, which was described at the time as a scientific approach.|$|E
5|$|The {{judge said}} there were three crucial points, in no {{particular}} order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, {{she could not have}} fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E
5|$|The <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts is to {{get people}} justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E

5000|$|Brewer {{took over}} at Ole Miss in 1983, {{succeeding}} Steve Sloan, who was 20-34-1 {{in the previous}} five seasons. Brewer's previous affiliation with Ole Miss made him a favorite in some circles at Ole Miss.

Others, however, thought that Brewer's ties to Vaught and Vaught's associates were the <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> he was considered for the position.|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} three liberal {{arguments about}} freedom of movement: immigration as {{a remedy for}} global injustice {{in the distribution of}} opportunities, freedom of movement as an integral aspect of individual autonomy, and immigration control as implied in democratic self-determination and citizenship. The article shows how these apparently irreconcilable stances can be reconstructed as partially overlapping once we realize that liberal citizenship provides not <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> for closure but entails a bundle of mobility rights and is open for access by migrant stakeholders...|$|R
