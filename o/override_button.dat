25|$|Electronic {{automatic}} flushes {{solve the}} problems of previous approaches, and are common in new installations. A passive infrared sensor identifies when the urinal has been used, by detecting when someone has stood in front of it and moved away, and then activates the flush. There usually is also a small <b>override</b> <b>button,</b> to allow optional manual flushing.|$|E
25|$|Some {{flushometer}} models {{require the}} user to either depress a lever or press a button, which in turn opens a flush valve allowing mains-pressure water to flow directly into the toilet bowl or urinal. Other flushometer models are electronically triggered, using an infrared sensor to initiate the flushing process. Typically, on electronically triggered models, an <b>override</b> <b>button</b> is provided in case the user wishes to manually trigger flushing earlier. Some electronically triggered models also incorporate a true mechanical manual override {{which can be used}} in the event of the failure of the electronic system. In retrofit installations, a self-contained battery-powered or hard-wired unit can be added to an existing manual flushometer to flush automatically when a user departs.|$|E
500|$|... "Homer Defined" [...] is {{the fifth}} episode of The Simpsons third season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 17, 1991. In the episode, Homer accidentally saves the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant from meltdown by arbitrarily choosing the emergency <b>override</b> <b>button</b> via a counting rhyme. He is honored as a hero and receives praise from his daughter Lisa, but he starts to feel unworthy because he knows that his so-called heroism was just luck. Meanwhile, Bart is downhearted after learning that Milhouse's mother has forbidden him {{to spend time with}} Bart anymore.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of a {{one-shot}} temporary installation, the hackers have {{designed and built}} a permanent facility that can be re-used repeatedly by the MIT community. An understanding has been reached with the EAPS Department, which is headquartered in the Green Building, to allow the light display hardware to remain installed in each window. [...] To avoid annoying the occupants and to allow late-working staff to [...] "opt out", each light display {{is equipped with a}} manual <b>override</b> <b>button,</b> which will disable the pixel lighting for that window for several hours after it is pressed. In addition, the hackers have released Open Source software tools used to develop new display patterns, so that others can design and deploy new stationary or animated images, in cooperation with the hacker engineers.|$|E
2500|$|At the retrofire event, {{the pitch}} horizon scanner malfunctioned once more, forcing Carpenter to {{manually}} control his reentry, which {{caused him to}} overshoot the planned splashdown point by [...] ("The malfunction of the pitch horizon scanner circuit [...] dictated that the pilot manually control the spacecraft attitudes during this event.") The PHS malfunction jerked the spacecraft off in yaw by 25 degrees to the right, accounting for [...] of the overshoot; the delay caused by the automatic sequencer required Carpenter to fire the retrorockets manually. This effort took two pushes of the <b>override</b> <b>button</b> and accounted for another 15 to [...] of the overshoot. The loss of thrust in the ripple pattern of the retros added another , producing a [...] overshoot.|$|E
50|$|American Airlines Flight 587, an Airbus A300, crashed {{when the}} {{vertical}} stabiliser broke off due to large rudder inputs by the pilot. A flight-envelope protection system {{could have prevented}} this crash, though it can still be argued that an <b>override</b> <b>button</b> should be provided for contingencies when the pilots {{are aware of the}} need to exceed normal limits.|$|E

50|$|For safety, trains {{must be kept}} {{at least}} two blocks apart during normal operation. A red MAPO {{indicates}} that train spacing has become unsafe. When a red MAPO occurs, the train's on-board computer locks out the pilot's propulsion control and applies emergency brakes. The pilot cannot resume control of the train until either the MAPO clears or the pilot presses and holds the MAPO <b>override</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{driver and}} {{signaller}} {{must come to}} a clear understanding, and ensure they agree about how {{it is to be}} done. In the UK the signaller tells the driver of a specific train to pass a specific signal at danger, proceed with caution and travel at a speed that enables him to stop short of any obstruction, and then obey all other signals. If the signal is fitted with TPWS, the driver resets the Driver reminder appliance, pushes the TPWS Trainstop <b>Override</b> <b>button</b> in the cab, and proceeds cautiously through the section. If the train reaches the next signal without finding an obstruction, he must obey its aspect, at which point he can revert to normal working.|$|E

5000|$|Trains {{often have}} a {{facility}} in each car to enable passengers to apply the brakes in case of emergency. In many modern trains, the driver is able to prevent brake activation when a passenger operates the emergency alarm [...] - an audible warning is sounded, and the driver is then {{able to talk to}} the person who activated the alarm on the intercom and see them on an internal CCTV. The driver can press an <b>override</b> <b>button</b> and hold the brakes off whilst he/she chooses a safe place to stop the train. Because of possible serious problems, severe fines and/or imprisonment penalties are in place to stop people from activating the brake without good reason.|$|E

50|$|In {{the third}} option, {{the whole group}} non-violently takes over the {{security}} room and stabilize the market while Shaw talks the suicidal man out of bombing the train. Left with little time, the Machine deploys the third option, even though it only has a 2.07% chance of the team's survival in taking over the elevator. These odds increase to 22.48% when Shaw arrives with explosives {{to fend off the}} attackers. The elevator, however, stops functioning right as they are about to escape. Shaw is forced to leave it and press an <b>override</b> <b>button</b> {{on the other side of}} the hallway, passionately kissing a concerned Root before doing so. As such, Martine (Cara Buono) catches up and shoots Shaw multiple times while Root and the team watch in horror.|$|E
50|$|At the retrofire event, {{the pitch}} horizon scanner malfunctioned once more, forcing Carpenter to {{manually}} control his reentry, which {{caused him to}} overshoot the planned splashdown point by 250 mi. ("The malfunction of the pitch horizon scanner circuit component of the automatic control system dictated that the pilot manually control the spacecraft attitudes during this event.") The PHS malfunction jerked the spacecraft off in yaw by 25 degrees to the right, accounting for 170 mi of the overshoot; the delay caused by the automatic sequencer required Carpenter to fire the retrorockets manually. This effort took two pushes of the <b>override</b> <b>button</b> and accounted for another 15 to 20 mi of the overshoot. The loss of thrust in the ripple pattern of the retros added another 60 mi, producing a 250 mi overshoot.|$|E

5000|$|Friendship 7 lost {{altitude}} in its reentry glide {{over the}} continental United States, {{and headed toward}} splashdown in the Atlantic. The Texas tracking station told Glenn to retain the retro pack until the accelerometer read 1.5 g (14.7 m/s2). Glenn reported as he crossed Cape Canaveral he had been controlling the spacecraft manually and would use the fly-by-wire mode as a backup. Mercury Control then gave him the 0.05 g (0.49 m/s2) mark, and he pressed the <b>override</b> <b>button.</b> About the same time, Glenn heard noises that sounded like [...] "small things brushing against the capsule." [...] "This is Friendship 7 - a real fireball outside," [...] he radioed Mercury Control. A strap from the retro package broke partially loose and hung over the spacecraft window as it was consumed in the reentry plasma stream. The spacecraft control system was working well but the manual fuel supply was down to 15 percent. The peak of reentry deceleration was still to come. Glenn switched to fly-by-wire and the automatic tank supply. This combination had more available fuel.|$|E
5000|$|To combat this {{dangerous}} habit, in 1971 NHTSA amended Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard № 208 (FMVSS 208) {{to require a}} seat belt/starter interlock system to prevent passenger cars from being started with an unbelted front-seat occupant. This mandate applied to passenger cars built after August 1973, i.e., starting with the 1974 model year. The specifications required the system to permit the car to be started only if the belt of an occupied seat were fastened after the occupant sat down, so pre-buckling the belts would not defeat the system. The interlock systems used logic modules complex enough to require special diagnostic computers, and were not entirely dependable—an <b>override</b> <b>button</b> was provided under the hood of equipped cars, permitting one (but only one) [...] "free" [...] starting attempt each time it was pressed. However, the interlock system spurred severe backlash from an American public who largely rejected seat belts. In 1974, Congress acted to prohibit NHTSA from requiring or permitting a system that prevents a vehicle from starting or operating with an unbelted occupant, or that gives an audible warning of an unfastened belt for more than 8 seconds after the ignition is turned on. This prohibition took effect on 27 October 1974, shortly after the 1975 model year began.|$|E
3000|$|If a {{consumer}} {{wants to make}} sure comfort will not be compromised, the consumer can make the central control settings [T_i^on T_i^off] or [T_i^off T_i^on], depending on whether the appliance is in heating or cooling mode, within [T_i^Lowlim [...] T_i^Highlim]. An <b>override</b> <b>button</b> can also disable the remote control of the thermal cell. When communication with the central controller fails, a cell will retain its previous switching status until the local setting, [T_i^Lowlim [...] T_i^Highlim], is violated.|$|E
