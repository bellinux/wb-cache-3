5|$|Though these larger {{philosophical}} {{traditions are}} clear influences on The Age <b>of</b> <b>Reason,</b> Paine owes the greatest intellectual {{debt to the}} English deists of the early eighteenth century, such as Peter Annet. John Toland had argued for the use <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> in interpreting scripture, Matthew Tindal had argued against revelation, Middleton had described the Bible as mythology and questioned the existence of miracles, Thomas Morgan had disputed {{the claims of the}} Old Testament, Thomas Woolston had questioned the believability of miracles and Thomas Chubb had maintained that Christianity lacked morality. All of these arguments appear in The Age <b>of</b> <b>Reason,</b> albeit less coherently.|$|E

5|$|According to Paine {{scholars}} Edward Davidson and William Scheick, {{he probably}} {{wrote the first}} draft of Part I in late 1793, but Paine biographer David Hawke argues for a date of early 1793.

François Lanthenas, who translated The Age <b>of</b> <b>Reason</b> into French in 1794, wrote that it was first published in France in 1793, but no book fitting his description has been positively identified.

40|$|Abstract: In his {{important}} {{recent book}} Schroeder proposes a Humean theory <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> that he calls hypotheticalism. His rigourous {{account of the}} weight <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> is crucial to his theory, both as {{an element of the}} theory and constituting his defence to powerful standard objections to Humean theories <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> In this paper I examine that rigourous account and show it to face problems of vacuity and consonance. There are technical resources that may be brought to bear on the problem of vacuity but implementation is not simple and philosophical motivation a further difficulty. Even supposing vacuity is fixed, the problems of consonance bring to light a different obstruction lying in Schroeder’s path. There is a difference between the general weighing <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> and the context specificity of the correct placing of weight on them in deliberation and this difference cannot be fixed by the resources in the account. For these reasons we are still waiting for a plausible Humean theory <b>of</b> <b>reasons...</b>|$|R
40|$|There is {{a wide-ranging}} {{discussion}} of two kinds <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> for attitudes, which are {{sometimes called the}} right and wrong kinds <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> The distinction, some think, applies to {{a whole range of}} different attitudes such as beliefs and intentions, as well as so-called pro-attitudes, e. g. admiration or desire in similar ways. Explaining it may therefore contribute significantly to understanding the nature <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> and normativity in general. In this paper, I argue for two claims: (1) we should sharply distinguish the wrong kind <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> problem as it arises for fitting attitude theories from any other problem that comes under the same name, and (2) the wrong kind <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> problem outside <b>of</b> fitting attitude theory doesn’t have a very clear shape, if indeed there is such a problem at all. In particular, there is no similarity between reasons to believe and reasons to intend in this regard, and therefore no hope for a unified explanation of the alleged phenomenon...|$|R

5|$|Following Thomas Williams's {{sentence}} of one year's hard labor for publishing The Age <b>of</b> <b>Reason</b> in 1797, no editions were sold openly in Britain until 1818 when Richard Carlile included {{it in an}} edition of Paine's complete works. Carlile charged one shilling and sixpence for the work, and the first run of 1,000 copies sold out in a month. He immediately published a second edition of 3,000 copies. Like Williams, he was prosecuted for seditious libel and blasphemous libel. The prosecutions surrounding the printing of The Age <b>of</b> <b>Reason</b> in Britain continued for thirty years after its initial release and encompassed numerous publishers as well as over a hundred booksellers.|$|E

40|$|Roger Crisp has {{inspired}} two important criticisms of Scanlon's buck-passing account of value. I defend buck-passing {{from the wrong}} kind <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> criticism, and the reasons and the good objection. I support Rabinowicz and Rønnow-Rasmussen's dual role <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> in refuting the wrong kind <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> criticism, even where its authors claim it fails. Crisp's reasons and the good objection contends that the property of goodness is buck-passing in virtue of its formality. I argue that Crisp conflates general and formal properties, and that Scanlon is ambiguous about whether the formal property <b>of</b> a <b>reason</b> can stop the buck. Drawing from Wallace, I respond to Crisp's reasons and the good objection by developing an augmented buck-passing account <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> and value, where the buck is passed consistently from the formal properties of both to the substantive properties of considerations and evaluative attitudes. I end by describing two unresolved problems for buck-passers...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} theories <b>of</b> practical <b>reason.</b> In particular I compare desire theories <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> with value theories <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> Desire theories <b>of</b> <b>reasons,</b> as I define them, {{claim that}} it is a necessary condition of A having a reason to ф that A’s reason depend on A’s antecedent desires. In contrast, I define value theories <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> as those theories that {{claim that it}} is a necessary condition of A having a reason to ф that A’s ф-ing be valuable. In this thesis my main concern lies with those value theorists who accept the motivational requirement: the claim that if an agent is to have a reason to ф, then it must be possible for the agent to ф on the basis <b>of</b> this <b>reason.</b> In particular, I concentrate on those value theorists who claim that A has a reason to ф iff a) A’s ф-ing is valuable; b) it is possible for A to ф on the basis <b>of</b> this <b>reason.</b> I reject desire theories <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> on the basis of several criticisms. I claim that our desires are normatively arbitrary, and that according to desire theories <b>of</b> <b>reasons,</b> some <b>of</b> our desires ought to be eradicated. I argue instead for a value theory <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> that adopts a particular interpretation of the motivational requirement. I distinguish three different interpretations of the motivational requirement, each offering a connection between reasons and motivations that differs in strength. The first, strongest requirement claims that in order for A to have a normative reason to ф, it must be possible for A to ф on the basis <b>of</b> this <b>reason</b> given certain qualities that A possesses (where I take the sense of ‘possible’ relevant to these interpretations to be one that reflects an agent’s capacities). The second and weakest requirement claims that in order for A to have a normative reason to ф, it must be possible for A to ф on the basis <b>of</b> this <b>reason</b> if A possessed certain qualities. The last and moderate requirement claims that in order for A to have a normative reason to ф, it must be possible for A to ф on the basis <b>of</b> this <b>reason</b> if A possessed certain qualities and A either has these qualities, or it is possible for her to get herself into a state where she has them. I argue for a value theory <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> that employs this last, moderate motivational requirement. I argue that a value theory that adopts the moderate motivational requirement is best, as it allows the theory to be practically useful; reasons on this account have a role in deterrence, encouragement and praise- and blame-worthiness. The theory also aligns with a plausible account of eligible candidates for reasons. While the employment of the moderate motivational requirement in a value theory <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> likens the theory, in some respects, to a desire theory, it avoids the objections raised against desire theories <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> In this way, a value theory <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> that employs the moderate motivational requirement combines the attractive features of a desire theory and a value theory. Specifically, it generates reasons that are both dependent on an individual’s qualities, and also aligned with an account of value. Thesis (Ph.

5|$|A Momentary Lapse <b>of</b> <b>Reason</b> is {{the thirteenth}} studio album by English {{progressive}} rock band Pink Floyd, {{released in the}} UK and US on 7 September 1987, on the labels EMI and Columbia. It followed guitarist David Gilmour's decision to include material recorded for his third solo album on a new Pink Floyd album with drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright. Although for legal reasons Wright could not be re-admitted to the band, Wright and Mason helped Gilmour craft what became the first Pink Floyd album since the December 1985 departure of bass guitarist, singer, and primary songwriter Roger Waters.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Part I of The Age <b>of</b> <b>Reason</b> was {{published}} in 1794, many British and French citizens had become disillusioned by the French Revolution. The Reign of Terror had begun, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had been tried and executed and Britain was at war with France. Those few British radicals who still supported the French revolution and its ideals were viewed with deep suspicion by their countrymen. The Age <b>of</b> <b>Reason</b> belongs to this later, more radical stage of the British political reform movement, one that openly embraced republicanism and atheism and is exemplified by such texts as William Godwin's Political Justice (1793). By {{the middle of the}} decade, the moderate voices had disappeared: Richard Price, the Dissenting minister whose sermon on political liberty had prompted Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), had died in 1791, and Joseph Priestley had been forced to flee to America after a Church–and–King mob burned down his home and church.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2005. This thesis {{explores the}} {{relative}} strengths of particularism and generalism {{in the area}} of meta-ethics in philosophy, utilising justice as a case study. More specifically, this thesis examines the claims of Jonathan Dancy in his book on moral particularism, Ethics Without Principles (2004), that one can construct a moral philosophy without reference to any general principles, or invariant reasons. His book is primarily a study <b>of</b> <b>reasons,</b> and this thesis also presents a study <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> through the eyes f both the particularists and the generalists. At its core, the particularism holds holism to be true in the theory <b>of</b> <b>reasons,</b> whereas generalism, at its core, holds atomism to be true in the theory <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> In my thesis I find that the strongest form of atomism and the strongest form of generalism is Rossean generalism. I conclude that these two pictures combined provide a superior account <b>of</b> what <b>reasons</b> are and how they work than Dancy's particularism...|$|R
