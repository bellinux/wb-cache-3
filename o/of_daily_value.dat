30|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to study an {{extended}} spectrum of airborne pollen characteristics (19 plant taxa) for the Szeged region in Southern Hungary. A novel procedure is introduced in order to separate the current and past effects of the climate variables influencing the current pollen concentration. Namely, arrays <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the influencing climate variables in the pollen season of the taxa examined were labelled as current variables, while arrays <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> these variables in the period starting from the first pollen-free day following the previous pollen season to the last pollen-free day preceding the actual pollen season were labelled as past variables. This kind of separation has not been demonstrated in the literature. Results are evaluated with special attention to the interactions between the phyto-physiological processes and the meteorological elements; furthermore, they are compared for each taxon based on different aspects.|$|R

25|$|The Australian, New Zealand, and European Union {{national}} nutrition bodies note {{there have}} been no reports of choline deficiency in the general population. The USA joins these three in not publishing a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), due to lack of consensus evidence. They have, however, published Adequate Intake (AI) values. The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) notes that these figures are based on just one study and that there was little data and the choline made by the body (assuming a dietary intake of zero) may be enough for some groups. Australia, New Zealand and Canada use the figures published by the US IOM. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published its own Adequate Intake values, most recently in 2016. For U.S. dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent <b>of</b> <b>Daily</b> <b>Value</b> (%DV) based on the AI. For choline, as shown in Reference Daily Intake, 100% of the Daily Value is 550mg.|$|E
500|$|On May 20, 2016 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{announced}} {{changes to}} the Nutrition Facts panel displayed on all foods, to be effective by July 2018. New to the panel is a requirement to list [...] "Added sugars" [...] by weight and as a percent <b>of</b> <b>Daily</b> <b>Value</b> (DV). For vitamins and minerals the intent of DVs is to indicate how much should be consumed. For added sugars, the guidance is that 100% DV should not be exceeded. 100% DV is defined as 50 grams. For a person consuming 2000 calories a day, 50 grams, the amount to not exceed, {{is the same as}} 200 calories, and thus 10% of total calories - same guidance as the World Health Organization. To put this into context, most 12 ounce (335 mL) cans of soda contain 39 grams of sugar. In the United States, a recently published government survey on food consumption reported that for men and women ages 20 and older the average total sugar intakes - naturally occurring in foods and added - were, respectively, 125 and 99 g/day.|$|E
