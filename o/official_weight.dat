25|$|Dreyer reached career-best {{form with}} the 56-pound outdoor weight in 1951; at the Metropolitan championships in June he threw 41ftin (12.68m), again {{breaking}} {{the world record}} and now legitimately, although as the IAAF didn't recognize <b>official</b> <b>weight</b> throw world records it was only ratified as an American record. He also won the national championship, throwing 41ft in (12.66m), a meeting record. In the hammer throw he placed second to Felton, throwing 182ftin (55.68m), his best mark ever at the national championships. He won a final national title with the 56-pound weight in 1952, throwing 40ftin (12.27m). His attempt {{to qualify for a}} third Olympic Games was not successful as, although he threw 173ftin (52.82m) at the 1952 Olympic Trials, it was only good enough for sixth place.|$|E

Cody worked out at API in Pensacola, Florida, along with Sam Bradford, Jason Worilds, and former Alabama teammates Mike Johnson and Roy Upchurch. He made pre-draft visits to the Baltimore Ravens, New York Jets, San Diego Chargers, and Kansas City Chiefs.|$|E

5000|$|Analysis of the {{thousands}} of surviving model weights strongly suggest multiple local weight standards in the Byzantine Empire before the Arab conquests.

500|$|The <b>official</b> <b>weight</b> of {{the shot}} was listed at 68lbs but in reality this varied {{according}} to the material {{of the shot}} itself; cast iron shot weighed , wrought iron shot and steel shot weighed , and chilled steel weighed [...] [...] It was estimated that one 68-pound shot had the destructive power equivalent to five 32-pound shot. The explosive shells were primed with [...] of gunpowder. They were fitted with simple fuses that were ignited by the flash of the charge – early wooden fuses were eventually replaced by more reliable fuses designed by Captain Edward Boxer in 1849. The gun crew still had to gauge the best length of fuse for the range they were firing – ideally the shell should explode just before hitting its target. To prevent the shell exploding in the barrel it was fitted with a sabot to ensure the fuse faced away from the charge.|$|E
500|$|In January 1944, the Soviets also {{invited a}} group {{of more than a}} dozen mostly American and British journalists, {{accompanied}} by Kathleen Harriman, the daughter of the new American ambassador W. Averell Harriman, and John F. Melby, third secretary at the American embassy in Moscow, to Katyn. The inclusion of Melby and Harriman was regarded by some at the time as a Soviet attempt to lend <b>official</b> <b>weight</b> to their propaganda. Melby's report noted the deficiencies in the Soviet case: problematic witnesses; attempts to discourage questioning of the witnesses; statements of the witnesses obviously being given as a result of rote memorization; and that [...] "the show was put on for the benefit of the correspondents". Nevertheless, Melby, at the time, felt that on balance the Russian case was convincing. Harriman's report reached the same conclusion and after the war both were asked to explain why their conclusions seemed to be at odds with their findings, with the suspicion that the conclusions were what the State Department wanted to hear. The journalists were less impressed and not totally convinced by the staged Soviet demonstration.|$|E
2500|$|A {{somewhat}} obscure {{chain of}} events followed (the so-called [...] "Moechian controversy," [...] from the Greek moichos, [...] "adulterer"), in which Theodore initiated a protest against the marriage from the Sakkudion Monastery, and appears to have demanded the excommunication, {{not only of the}} priest Joseph, but also of all who had received communion from him, which, as Joseph was a priest of the imperial church, included implicitly the emperor and his court. This demand had no <b>official</b> <b>weight,</b> however, and Constantine appears to have attempted to make peace with Theodore and Platon (who, on account of his marriage, were now his relatives), inviting them to visit him during a sojourn at the imperial baths of Prusa in Bithynia. In the event neither appeared.|$|E

CMLL held a tournament to crown a new champion, and on April 7, 2009, Máscara Dorada won a torneo cibernetico elimination match for the super lightweight championship.

His fourth reign lasted from June 2011 to April 5, 2015 where he lost the championship to Dragon Lee. On January 23, 2016 Dragon Lee defended the championship on the 2016 Fantastica Mania tour of Japan, marking the first time since 2000 that the championship was defended in Japan.

In 1948, the building was placed into the care of the Ministry of Works, who repaired the damage inflicted to the tower during the Second World War, and extensively restored the building, clearing the surrounding area and opening the tower for tourists. In the 21st century, the Jewel Tower is managed by English Heritage, receiving around 30,000 visitors each year.|$|R
