40|$|The {{transfer}} of the knowledge - developed in research activities - {{is one of the}} main missions of the University to spread innovative technologies on the market. The outcomes obtained in a multidisciplinary research project - aimed at designing, prototyping and monitoring a modular Living Wall System (LWS) with high energy and environmental performance - led to the founding of the Growing Green. Growing Green is a Politecnico di Torino's Spin-off working in cooperation with University of Turin and hosted by the Innovative Enterprise Incubator I 3 P (Politecnico di Torino). The development and production of eco-friendly LWSs, closely connected to R&D activities, can be assumed as the Growing Green core business. The Spin-off is therefore aimed to place on the construction market low environmental impact LWSs based on: simplified and standardized products; vegetated modular boxes manufactured with a limited number of materials, substructures and installations; a building system characterized by reversible connections. The paper deals with a new way of working within Universities in order to achieve high level of innovation and positive impacts on economy and society. The paper discusses technological and agronomic aspects related to manufacturing (e. g. reduction of material intensity, industrialization of processes), <b>on</b> <b>site</b> <b>assembling</b> (e. g. quick-installing procedures, pre-vegetation, building integration) and maintenance stages (e. g. reduction of water needs and number of pruning per year, automatic control) through the presentation of two case studies (outdoor vs indoor LWSs) ...|$|E

IBS is a construction method where {{all or part of}} the building components of the structure such as column, beam, slab is fabricated or precast in the factory or <b>on</b> <b>site</b> and <b>assembled</b> <b>on</b> <b>site.</b> IBS was introduced in Malaysia since 1964. The usage of IBS in the construction was encouraged by CIDB for the advantages of IBS such as less construction time, saving in labours, less wet job <b>on</b> <b>site</b> better quality control and etc. In our country this system is not widely used due the barriers of implementation such as lack of knowledge in IBS system and so on. This study is focused on precast concrete structure only. It is also to know issues and challenges implementation on precast building and to identify the disadvantages IBS system therefore an understanding about barrier implement IBS system, issues and challenges and lastly disadvantages will be discussed in this report. Questionnaires survey was conducted in order to achieve the objectives. The respondents consisted of contractors, architects, and local authority.

40|$|During the {{construction}} {{stage of a}} building with high clearances, large spans and thick slabs, the isolated tower scaffolds which have higher load-carrying capacity are often considered {{to serve as the}} falsework and meet the load demand of the building. Because isolated tower scaffolds served as temporary supports are immediately removed after finishing {{the construction}} stage, the importance is often neglected. Up to now, the information on the structural design of isolated tower scaffolds has been rather scarce, and the assembly of isolated tower scaffolds <b>on</b> construction <b>sites</b> still relies mainly on the experienced workers. This phenomenon results in a high risk of collapse in actual application of isolated tower scaffolds <b>on</b> construction <b>sites.</b> This study explores the critical loads and the failure models of isolated tower scaffolds in various setups by testing actual installations of isolated tower scaffolds based <b>on</b> construction <b>sites.</b> The research results show that the base screw jack has a limited effect on the overall load-carrying capacity of isolated tower scaffolds. When isolated tower scaffolds are set up on ground with different elevations or on ground under an inclined top slab with varying elevations, the load-carrying capacity is not affected evidently if the elevation is less than half meter. <b>On</b> construction <b>sites,</b> when <b>assembled</b> in multiple layers, th...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{addition}} to its kinase activity, myosin light chain kinase has an actin-binding activity, which results in bundling of actin filaments [Hayakawa et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 199, 786 – 791, 1994]. There are two actin-binding <b>sites</b> <b>on</b> the kinase: calcium- and calmodulin-sensitive and insensitive sites [Ye et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272, 32182 – 32189, 1997]. The calcium/calmodulin-sensitive, actin-binding site is located at Asp 2 –Pro 41 and the insensitive site is at Ser 138 –Met 213. The cyanogen bromide fragment, consisting of Asp 2 –Met 213, is furnished with both sites and is the actin-binding core of myosin light chain kinase. Cross-linking between the two <b>sites</b> <b>assembles</b> actin filaments into bundles. Breaking of actin-binding at the calcium/calmodulin-sensitive site by calcium/calmodulin disassembles the bundles...|$|R
40|$|The current {{practice}} for wind turbine foundations {{is to use}} massive cast-in-place concrete spread footings or complex pile-supported foundations. Wind turbine generator components and the towers that support them are pre-fabricated and <b>assembled</b> <b>on</b> <b>site,</b> leaving the foundation as the only component of the wind turbine system requiring major in situ construction. The new “hexapod” foundation concept is fully pre-fabricated, uses {{a fraction of the}} quantity of concrete used in conventional foundations, and may be dismantled and re-used elsewhere. The wind turbine tower is attached to a steel or concrete hub which is attached to six radial, precast, post-tensioned concrete beams. The hub and beams are transported to the <b>site,</b> <b>assembled,</b> and anchored to the ground using micropiles. The “hexapod” foundation concept was studied in the context of governing design standards and anticipated structural behavior, and a set of design criteria were established. A parametric structural study was conducted to determine the “hexapod” foundation configurations that exhibited the most favorable performance according to the design criteria, and to observe the sensitivity of the foundation’s performance to changes in design properties. Based on the parametric study, recommendations for design and for future study were established...|$|R
40|$|Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) {{resemble}} protein-coding mRNAs {{but do not}} encode proteins. Most lncRNAs {{are under}} lower sequence constraints than protein-coding genes and lack conserved secondary structures, {{making it hard to}} predict them computationally. We introduce an approach to predict spliced lncRNAs in vertebrate genomes combining comparative genomics and machine learning. It is based on detecting signatures of characteristic splice site evolution in vertebrate whole genome alignments. We individually predict splice <b>sites,</b> <b>assemble</b> compatible <b>sites</b> into exon candidates, and obtain multi-exon transcript predictions. Using a novel method to evaluate typical splice site substitution patterns that explicitly takes the species phylogeny into account, we show that individual splice sites can be accurately predicted.

40|$|A first Ultimate Trough® (UT) {{collector}} demonstration loop {{was successfully}} integrated in an existing {{solar power plant}} in California and is now put into operation. Its huge dimensions of one Solar Collector Assembly (SCA) with an aperture of 7. 5 m and a length of 247 m makes it the largest parabolic trough collector ever built and operated. It is expected that this collector reduces the solar field cost by 20 to 25 %. The fabrication and erection of a collector with the present dimensions exceeds present knowledge and experience. To provide safety {{for the design of}} upcoming solar thermal power plants with the same collector, it was decided to demonstrate all fabrication and erection procedures as they will be applied in series production. The paper describes the part manufacturing, as well as <b>site</b> <b>assembling</b> procedures, transportation and new developed erection tools. Furthermore, it gives an overview on the assembly process <b>on</b> <b>site.</b> The UT collector is designed to avo id complex and costly SCE alignment procedures in the field.

40|$|A long-standing {{problem in}} {{chromosome}} biology concerns the dynamic nature of centromeres.

In multicelluar eukaryotes, centromeres are typically composed of highly homogeneous tandem repeats that evolve rapidly despite their highly conserved function [1]. For tandem repeats to evolve, a mutation must spread by some recombinational process, but a persistent dogma is that centromeres do not undergo homologous chromosome recombination (the shuffling of genetic segments between chromosomal pairs). New evidence [2] challenges this dogma and addresses {{the problem of}} rapidly evolving centromeres.
