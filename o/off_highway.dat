According to Babcock, the barn where he was born (which no longer exists) was located <b>off</b> <b>Highway</b> 38 in South Frontenac Township. His father died in 1906 after a tree-cutting accident, when Babcock was only six years old. As described in his account given to Maclean's, while his father was cutting down one tree, another dead tree fell on his shoulder.

500|$|Kenny Roberts' {{parents were}} Alice and Melton [...] "Buster" [...] Roberts. As a {{child growing up}} in the rural {{agriculture}} area just <b>off</b> <b>highway</b> 132 near the West side vineyards of E & J Gallo Winery of Modesto, Roberts was originally interested in horseback riding. He rode his first motorcycle at the age of 12 when a friend dared him to ride a mini bike. Roberts accepted the challenge and the experience thrilled him. He built his own motorcycle by attaching his father's lawn mower engine to a bicycle frame. Roberts began his career in dirt track racing after attending a local race in Modesto and deciding that he wanted to compete himself. His father purchased a Tohatsu bike for him, but once it proved itself uncompetitive as a race bike, he moved up to a more powerful Hodaka motorcycle.|$|E
500|$|Extreme {{amounts of}} {{rainfall}} were produced over Alabama. Dauphin Island {{had the highest}} amount of rainfall, 37.75inches (959mm) reported by the HPC. [...] Dauphin Island Sea Lab recorded 36.71inches (932mm) of rain, {{but not all the}} rain may have recorded in the rain gauge at this location, so it is possible the rainfall may have been underestimated. Doppler weather radar estimates show that around 43inches (1,090mm) of rain fell off the coast of Dauphin Island. A storm surge of over 6.5feet (1.98m) occurred <b>off</b> <b>Highway</b> 182, midway between Gulf Shores and Fort Morgan, in addition to the rainfall. Unusually, when the storm stalled off the coast of Alabama, prevailing northerly winds forced the water out of Mobile Bay, causing tides to be twofeet (0.61m) below normal. Observers noted that, if river channels had not remained, it would have been possible to walk across the bay unhindered by water. Additionally, a four-story condominium project that was under construction in Gulf Shores crashed due to high winds. [...] In addition, three tornadoes occurred in Alabama, one being in Orange Beach, another in Opelika, while the other one occurred in Alabama Port. There were some other tornadoes that also caused minimal damage.|$|E

Later, elements of the North Vietnamese 3rd ‘Gold Star’ Division [...] secured a section of Highway 19 at Thuong An that connected with Bridge no.13 at Dong An Khe, killing about 300 South Vietnamese soldiers. [...] On the night of March 5, the North Vietnamese 25th Regiment ambushed a South Vietnamese transportation convoy at Chi Cuc and cut <b>off</b> <b>Highway</b> 21 west of Ban Me Thuot. To keep all the main roads open, Phu sent reinforcements to defend a section of Highway 19 at {{the eastern side of}} Peiku and ordered the ARVN 45th Infantry Regiment to march back from Thuan Man to defend Route 14 at southern Pleiku. The ARVN 53rd Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel Vu The Quang, was redeployed from Quang Duc Province to defend Ban Me Thuot. By March 8, the North Vietnamese army had completely isolated the South Vietnamese II Corps Tactical Zone {{from the rest of the}} country.
