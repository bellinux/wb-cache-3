5|$|In {{his first}} cabinet decision, Modi {{set up a}} team to {{investigate}} black money. On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes, with the stated intention of curbing corruption, black money, the use of counterfeit currency, and terrorism. The move led to widespread protests throughout the country, including one by opposition parties, which stalled the winter session of parliament. In the days following the demonetisation, banks across the country faced severe cash shortages, which had detrimental effects on a number <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>businesses,</b> on agriculture, and on transportation. People seeking to exchange their notes had lengthy waits, and several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash. Following Modi's announcement, the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50 declined steeply. There has been a steep increase in digital payments and transactions in the country since the day demonetization was announced.

40|$|The issues <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>business</b> {{efficiency}} development, {{and influence}} of certain support measures on this process are studied insufficiently. The aim of the article {{is to determine the}} influence of support measures on the development <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>business.</b> The method <b>of</b> the correlation analysis at regional level of Ukraine and ARK (25 cases) is used. From the carried out correlation analysis at the regional level it is possible to note that quantitative parameters <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>business</b> development aren't coordinated with qualitative parameters (a share in volumes of realization, an employment share at small enterprises). Also quantitative parameters don't determine region development (correlation with GRP per capita is absent). Thus qualitative parameters <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>business</b> development considerably correlate with an indicator of regional development (GRP per capita), and also define the business development level on a certain territory. Having carried out the correlation analysis between indicators of development and support <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>business</b> at regional level, it is possible to note that the development of these actions is separate from its expediency at the macrolevel (correlation coefficients are insignificant). On the basis of the conducted research the following suggestions to increase the support efficiency and stimulation <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>business</b> development were formulated. It will be more effective to change from quantitative stimulation <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>business</b> development to its qualitative support; it will be expedient to diversify objects of economic support. The main conclusion from the conducted research is that actions for support are isolated at the macrolevel and don't consider features of quantitative and qualitative development <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>business</b> at the regional level. This isolation of actions is caused by the lack of long-term strategy <b>of</b> development <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>business</b> at the national level...|$|R
