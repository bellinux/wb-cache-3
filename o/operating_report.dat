30|$|It {{might be}} {{surprising}} that the pictures taken 20  years ago with a photo camera were of better quality than those taken today with a video camera. Indeed, the resolution of video cameras is only 640 [*]×[*] 480 pixels and even in HD only 1, 920 [*]×[*] 1, 080 which corresponds to 0.3 and 2 megapixels, respectively. This indeed is a low resolution {{in comparison with the}} picture of the widely available 10 -megapixel photo camera. Especially when needed to be enlarged, surgical pictures of better quality would be an advantage. Photo documentation of surgery and integration of pictures in the <b>operating</b> <b>report</b> is considered a step forward since one picture tells more than 1, 000 words and since it facilitates reviewing and sharing the data of surgery. Ideally, these pictures should be incorporated in a hard copy or in the electronic patient file and thus in the IT system of the hospital. Without integration in a report, isolated pictures have to be reviewed separately which is time consuming.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Human {{resource}} management {{is a process}} of bringing people and organizations together so that the goals of each other are met. Nowadays {{it is not possible to}} show a good financial or <b>operating</b> <b>report</b> unless your personnel relations are in order. Over the years, highly skilled and knowledge based jobs are increasing while low skilled jobs are decreasing. This calls for future skill mapping through proper HRM initiatives. Indian organizations are also witnessing a change in systems, management cultures and philosophy due to the global alignment of Indian organizations. There is a need for multi skill development. Competency Mapping {{is a process of}} identifying key competencies for an organization, the jobs and functions within it. Competency mapping is important and is an essential activity. Every well-managed firm should have well defined roles and list of competencies required to perform each role effectively. Competency mapping identifies an individual’s strengths and weaknesses in order to help them better understand themselves and to show them where career development efforts need to be directed. Competency mapping is not only done for Confirmed employees of an organization and it can also be done for contract workers or for those seeking employment to emphasize the specific skills which would make them valuable to a potential employer. These kinds of skills can be determined, when one is ready to do the work. Competency mapping is one of the most accurate means in identifying the job and behavioral competencies of an individual in an organization. Competency is a set of knowledge, skills and attitudes required to perform a job effectively and efficiently. A Competency is something that describes how a job might be done excellently; a Competence only describes what has to be done, not how. Core competency is something which cannot be copied and it is the pillar upon which individual rest...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} an {{evaluation}} of The California Wellness Foundation's (TCWF) grantmaking. Past evaluations of TCWF's core <b>operating</b> <b>report</b> (COS) funding strategy demonstrated that COS {{has been successful in}} building organizational sustainability and capacity, as well as helping grantee organizations leverage funds, increase credibility, and build trust with TCWF [...] but those studies took place during much better economic times. This report was prepared by Harder+Company Community Research to explore the effects of the COS funding strategies under the far more difficult economic circumstances of 2009 and 2010. Of the 581 grantee organizations with active grants in 2009 and/or 2010, 424 responded to the evaluation survey, reflecting a 73 percent response rate. Through an analysis of TCWF documents and databases, financial data, survey data, and case studies, this report seeks to answer the following evaluation questions: What was the impact of the recession on TCWF grantees? How were the 2009 and 2010 TCWF COS grants used? What was the impact of the 2009 and 2010 COS grants on organizations? By evaluating the COS grants that were active in 2009 and 2010 [...] years that include the official end of the recession and its immediate aftermath [...] we were able to identify the effects of this type of funding during a period of major financial strain for most nonprofits. This is a unique opportunity to learn about COS that could inform funding practices now and into the future. The findings from this evaluation reveal that {{in the midst of the}} recession, TCWF has supported and even strengthened organizations in a variety of important [...] and even surprising [...] ways. This summary highlights key findings, while the full report provides further detail...|$|E

The Department of Defense (DOD) accounted for the greatest decline in in-house printing plants. The 1990 JCP Regulations listed 142 DOD printing plants; however, the Defense Logistics Agency, which currently manages the majority of DOD's printing infrastructure, reported 17 in-house printing plants in GAO's survey. In addition, most agencies <b>reported</b> <b>operating</b> toner-based high-speed duplication machines, and fewer <b>reported</b> <b>operating</b> ink-based conventional printing presses.

No agency reported having only ink-based conventional printing presses at its in-house plants. In addition, interviews with selected agencies showed declines in printing volumes and total spending, and suggested that agencies spent more on printing sent to the Government Printing Office (GPO) and its contracted private printers than on printing done at in-house printing plants. ...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{criticism}} {{has been raised}} against the Swedish fire brigades both from their own staff and from researchers regarding deficiencies in learning and experience feedback within the organizations. Among other things, they {{have been criticized for}} that the documentation is only proliferating paper work because there is no system available for deriving advantage from the experience. A researcher who has studied the area is Anna-Karin Lindberg, who reviewed the learning from the fire brigades <b>operating</b> <b>reports.</b> She concludes, among other things, that the spreading of knowledge and lessons learned from the <b>operating</b> <b>reports</b> do not work particularly well. At the Greater Stockholm Fire Brigade there were suspicions that the same problems regarding the <b>operating</b> <b>reports</b> also applied to the fire investigations. We have in this thesis reviewed parts of the process of fire investigations to identify deficiencies, mainly with regard to experience feedback from the suggestions for improvement put forward in fire investigations. The work was conducted in three steps encompassing: 1) analyzing various theoretical models to be used in fire/accident investigations, 2) reviewing fire investigations to examine their coherence with theory, and, 3) reviewing the content, quality and extent of the suggestions for improvement contained in fire investigations. The completed study covers a total of 130 fire investigations, written by Stockholm / the Greater Stockholm Fire Brigade in the years 2006 to 2010. Fire investigations have been reviewed and the various suggestions for improvement have then been indexed in a database. From this database, and through interviews and literature studies, we note that there are deficiencies in the process of experience feedback from fire investigations, mainly referring to the suggestions for improvement which only reach out to a small number of people, both internally and externally. The external distribution is more or less exclusive to the Swedish Civil Contingency Agency (MSB) and the suggestions for improvement that primarily should be handled locally may not be carried out. There are also uncertainties regarding whom or what part of the organization that is responsible for passing on the suggestions for improvement and {{there is a lack of}} effective channels for disseminating the information to the most crucial recipients. In conclusion, it is recommended that the Greater Stockholm Fire Brigade: - develops a system for how the suggestions for improvement and experiences best should be handled and pin down which part of the organization that is responsible for communicating them. - customizes the report template so that it aims at concrete suggestions for improvement and introduces a mailing list or something equivalent. - initiate contacts with the most frequent recipients of suggestions for improvement and examines how these should be performed.
