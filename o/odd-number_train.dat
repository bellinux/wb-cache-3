50|$|Trains are {{classified}} as either up (even-numbered) <b>trains</b> or down (<b>odd-numbered)</b> <b>trains.</b> Since the capital Beijing is treated as {{the focal point of}} the rail network, trains from Beijing are down services (e.g. the T109 from Beijing to Shanghai), while trains towards Beijing are up services (e.g. the T110 from Shanghai to Beijing).|$|R

25|$|The {{second and}} third digits {{indicate}} the sequence number of the train. For instance, x01 is the first train of the day. These digits also indicate {{the direction of the}} train; <b>odd-numbered</b> <b>trains</b> run northbound, and even-numbered trains run southbound. Thus x02 is the first southbound train of the day, x03 is the second northbound train of the day, etc.|$|R
50|$|There are 60 Haruka train {{services}} per day, numbered 1 to 60; <b>odd-numbered</b> <b>trains</b> run south (toward the airport) and even-numbered trains run north (away {{from the}} airport). They operate {{every half hour}} during the daytime and early evening. The typical travel time between Kyoto Station and the airport is 75 minutes for southbound trains and 73 minutes for northbound trains.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, most {{railroad}}s use [...] "east and west", and it {{is unusual}} for a railroad to designate [...] "north and south" [...] (the New York City Subway and the Washington Metro are rare examples). Even-numbered trains (superior) travel east (or north). <b>Odd-numbered</b> <b>trains</b> (inferior) travel west (or south). An easy way to remember this: [...] "ODD trains go to San Francisco (west). VERY ODD trains go to Los Angeles (south)".|$|R
50|$|Today railway operations, {{apart from}} {{occasional}} specials, are only run in regular timetabled service using the yellow-green Regio-Shuttles of the Regentalbahn under the operating name of Waldbahn. Trains from the long-distance stop at Plattling, from Bodenmais station {{and from the}} border station of Bayerisch Eisenstein (including trains that are run {{to and from the}} Czech station at Špičák) meet every hour just before the hour. On every <b>odd-numbered</b> hour, <b>trains</b> from Grafenau also meet at the station.|$|R
5000|$|Summer-season {{construction}} {{began in}} 1910 including ten reinforced concrete bridges. The longest was a 200 ft span over the Presumpscot River There was a 100 ft span over the Little Androscoggin River in Auburn and {{a span of}} similar length near West Falmouth. Approximately 30 mi of 70 lb steel rail was laid in 33 ft lengths over private right-of-way connecting segments of trackage rights over Portland, Lewiston, and Auburn city streetcar lines. Scheduled interurban service began on 7 July 1914. At Gray, <b>odd-numbered</b> northbound <b>trains</b> took a siding to cross even-numbered southbound trains on the following route from north to south: ...|$|R
50|$|The TEE service {{started with}} trainnumber TEE 128 (Paris - Brussel), at 1 September 1963 the trainnumber TEE 119 was {{assigned}} to the southbound train. At 26 May 1967 the train was renumbered, the northbound service became TEE 64, the southbound service became TEE 61. At 23 May 1971 a new renumbering was implemented. All TEE services between Amsterdam and Paris got sequential numbers from 80 up to 87. The <b>odd-numbers</b> for northbound <b>trains,</b> the even-numbers for southboud trains. Within these numbers TEE 83 and TEE 84 were assigned to TEE Brabant.|$|R
