5|$|Scholars {{disagree}} on the possible period of the church's construction; assessments range from the 11th–12th, through the 12th–13th, to the 13th–14th century. In {{an article in the}} Bulgarian Church Review magazine from 1898, the local priest Mihal Popov was cited as saying that a stone from the church altar was unearthed during excavations. The priest believed that the stone, which reportedly had the date 1160 inscribed <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> <b>was</b> sent to the National Archaeological Museum in the capital Sofia.|$|E
5|$|The oldest known Chinese {{piece of}} hard, hempen {{wrapping}} paper {{dates to the}} 2nd century BC. The standard papermaking process was invented by Cai Lun (50–121 AD) in 105 AD.

5|$|Although it is {{recorded}} that the Han Dynasty (202 BC– AD 220) court eunuch Cai Lun (50 AD– AD 121) invented the pulp papermaking process and established {{the use of}} new materials used in making paper, ancient padding and wrapping paper artifacts dating to the 2nd century BC {{have been found in}} China, the oldest example of pulp papermaking being a map from Fangmatan, Tianshui; by the 3rd century, paper as a writing medium was in widespread use, replacing traditional but more expensive writing mediums such as strips of bamboo rolled into threaded scrolls, strips of silk, wet clay tablets hardened later in a furnace, and wooden tablets. The earliest known piece of paper with writing <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> discovered in the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, where Han Dynasty troops had deserted their position in AD 110 following a Xiongnu attack. In the paper making process established by Cai in 105, a boiled mixture of mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens and fish nets created a pulp that was pounded into paste and stirred with water; a wooden frame sieve with a mat of sewn reeds was then dunked into the mixture, which was then shaken and then dried into sheets of paper that were bleached under the exposure of sunlight; K.S. Tom says this process was gradually improved through leaching, polishing and glazing to produce a smooth, strong paper. Paper is used a lot.|$|E

The targets were photographed when the chairman of the Federation Council of Russia Sergei Mironov visited the centre on 7 November 2006.|$|E
5|$|Model {{spent the}} first year of World War II as a chief of staff, first of IV Corps during the {{invasion}} of Poland, and then of Sixteenth Army during the Battle of France. He was promoted to lieutenant general (Generalleutnant) in April 1940, and earned his first senior command posting in November that year, when he was assigned to lead the 3rd Panzer Division. He immediately proceeded to ignore all formalities of organization and command, which endeared him to his men and exasperated his staff—who often had {{to clean up the mess}} he left behind. He also instituted a combined arms training programme where his men were thrown together in various ad-hoc groupings regardless of their parent unit: tankers would train with infantry, engineers with recon units, and so on. Model thus anticipated by some months the regular German use of Kampfgruppen in World War II. While this would become routine later <b>on,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> still not a universal practice in the Wehrmacht in late 1940 and early 1941.|$|E

5|$|The Bayern {{class was}} {{a class of}} four super-dreadnought battleships built by the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy). The class {{comprised}} , , Sachsen, and Württemberg. Construction started on the ships shortly before World War I; Baden was laid down in 1913, Bayern and Sachsen followed in 1914, and Württemberg, the final ship, was laid down in 1915. Only Baden and Bayern were completed, due to shipbuilding priorities changing as the war dragged <b>on.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> determined that U-boats were more valuable to the war effort, and so work on new battleships was slowed and ultimately stopped altogether. As a result, Bayern and Baden were the last German battleships completed by the Kaiserliche Marine.|$|E
5|$|The {{directors}} had {{twelve days}} to film two episodes each, equating to approximately {{five minutes of}} screen-time per day.

Although listed as a Category 1 hurricane for its entire known existence by the hurricane database, the storm was not confirmed to have attained hurricane intensity until July21.
