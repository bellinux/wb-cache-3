The spores {{were collected from}} basidiocarps in plantations of Eucalyptus spp and the mycelia from culture in MNM medium. With basis on the fungus growth curve, the mycelia masses were obtained after 10, 20, 30, and 40 days of incubation, which correspond, respectively, to the beginning, middle {{and end of the}} log phase, and beginning of the decline phase. The mycelia masses, together with the spores, were submitted to the action of three extractors (Coca, Tris-HCl, and ammonium bicarbonate). The contents of carbohydrates and proteins were determined. The SDS-PAGE electrophoretical analysis revealed separate fractions in these extracts, besides common fractions, in function of cultivation time and extraction methods. The selected extracts for the allergic tests were the ones with the highest number of fractions. The prick-tests were conducted in 374 patients ? rural workers, eucalyptus plantation works and college students. The positivity to the "prick test" with the antigenic extract of P. tinctorius was, respectively, 3. 78 %, 28. 20 % and 6. 40 %. Most prick-test positive patients (82. 75 %) also presented symptoms of respiratory allergy (asthma and rhinitis). There was no reactivity difference when the spore and mycelia extracts were employed. The analysis of the positive patients? sera revealed the presence of IgE specific to the P. tinctorius antigens. Since Pisolithus tinctorius is found as mycorrhyza of Eucalyptus spp, and this plant is used in reforestation in most countries, the importance of that fungus should be regarded as a possible cause of respiratory allergies, especially in <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>worker...</b>|$|E

40|$|Perfluoro{{octanoic acid}} (PFOA) is an octanoic acid {{derivative}} {{to which all}} aliphatic hydrocarbons are substituted by fluorine.

It was reported that PFOA is found {{not only in the}} serum of <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> but also general populations. Recent studies have suggested that the biological half-life of PFOA in humans is 4. 37 years based on study of <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>workers.</b> It is increasingly suspect that PFOA accumulates and affects human health, although the toxicokinetics of PFOA in humans remain unclear. In experimental animals, PFOA seems low in toxicity. PFOA is well-absorbed following oral and inhalation exposure, {{and to a lesser extent}} following dermal exposure. Once absorbed in the body, it distributes predominantly to the liver and plasma, and to a lesser extent the kidney and lungs. PFOA is excreted in both urine and feces. Biological half-life of PFOA is quite different between species and sexes and the difference is due mainly to the difference in renal clearance. In rats, renal clearance of PFOA is regulated by sex hormones, especially testosterone. PFOA is excreted into urine by active tubular secretion, and certain organic anion transporters are thought to be responsible for the secretion. Fecal excretion is also important in the elimination of PFOA. There is evidence that PFOA undergoes enterohepatic circulation resulting in reduced amounts of fecal excretion. Elucidation of the mechanisms of transport in biological systems leads to elimination and detoxification of this chemical in the human body. 「J-STAGE」で公開...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionIndividuals exposed both to {{cigarette}} smoke and respiratory pollutants at work incur {{a greater risk}} of development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and accelerated decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) than that incurred by subjects undergoing each exposure separately. We examined whether smoking cessation or smoking reduction improves AHR and thereby slows down the decline in FEV 1 in <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>workers.</b> MethodsWe examined 165 workers (137 males and 28 females) participating in a smoking cessation programme. Nicotine tablets were used for smoking cessation or smoking reduction. Respiratory symptoms were assessed by questionnaire, FEV 1 by spirometry and AHR by methacholine challenge test. At 1 year, subjects were classified into quitters, reducers, or continuing smokers. ResultsSixty-seven subjects completed the study (32 quitters; 17 reducers; 18 continuing smokers). Respiratory symptoms improved markedly in quitters (P< 0. 001 for all comparisons) and less so in reducers (P values between 0. 163 and 0. 027). At 1 year, FEV 1 had slightly but significantly improved in quitters (P= 0. 006 vs. smokers; P= 0. 038 vs. reducers) and markedly deteriorated in reducers and continuing smokers. Concurrent, 1 -year change in AHR did not differ significantly among the groups. ConclusionIn <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>workers,</b> stopping smoking markedly improved respiratory symptoms and, in males, slowed the annual decline in FEV 1.

The effect of genotype, age, exposure to genotoxic agents and smoking habit on MN induction was determined using Poisson regression analysis in 171 <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> male <b>workers</b> and in 132 non-exposed male referents. The {{analysis of}} genotype-genotype, genotype-smoking and genotype-exposure interactions by linear combinations of parameters showed significantly higher MN frequencies in the following subsets: (i) <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> carrying either the Thr/Thr or the Thr/Met XRCC 3 (241) genotypes compared to their referent counterparts (P < 0. 001) and (ii) carriers of the Met/Met XRCC 3 (241) genotype compared to Thr/Thr XRCC 3 (241) carriers, as far as they are non-exposed and bear the variant (Ser/Cys or Cys/Cys) hOGG 1 (326) genotype (P < 0. 01). Significantly lower MN frequencies were observed in carriers of the variant hOGG 1 (326) genotype compared to Ser/Ser hOGG 1 (326) carriers in the subgroup of non-smokers with Thr/Thr XRCC 3 (241) genotype (P < 0. 01). Stratified analysis by occupational exposure showed a significant MN increase with smoking in <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> carriers of the Arg/Gln XRCC 1 (399) genotype (P < 0. 001). In contrast, a significant MN decrease with smoking was observed in referents carrying the Ser/Ser hOGG 1 (326) genotype (P < 0. 01). These findings provide evidence that the combination of different DNA repair genes and their interaction with environmental genotoxic agents may modulate MN induction. Understanding the complexity of the relationships between exposure, DNA repair and MN frequencies require larger scale studies and complementary biomarkers. status: publishe...|$|R

The risk of infection to others after discharge in the community and of unexpected late clinical events for the patient make discharge policies difficult to formulate...|$|R

Praćenje parametara je obuhvatilo merenje aktivnosti holinesteraze eritrocita, bioelektrične aktivnosti kore velikog mozga, reakcionih vremena, vizuelne diskriminacije, vizuelne identifikacije i profil indeks emocija. Dobijeni rezultati su upoređivani sa rezultatima kontrolnih grupa, a dobijene razlike su testirane Studentovim t-testom. Osim toga ispitivana je i linearna korelacija pojedinih parametara istraživanja. Razmatrani su mogući mehanizmi nastajanja uočenih promena posmatranih parametara kod grupe radnika profesionalno izloženih insekticidima inhibitorima holinesteraze. The paper {{deals with}} the effects of insecticides, cholinesterase inhibitors, on certain neurophysiological, psychomotor, and {{psychological}} parameters in <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>workers.</b> The parameters measured were: the activities of erythrocyte cholinesterase, the bioelectrical activity of the cerebrum core, reaction times, visual discrimination, visual identification and the emotion index profile. The results were compared to the results from control groups, and the differences were analysed by Student 2 ̆ 7 s test. The linear correlation of certain parameters was also examined. Possible mechanisms responsible for the changes in parameters are discussed...|$|R
