5|$|DNA {{is found}} as linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. A chromosome is an <b>organized</b> <b>structure</b> consisting of DNA and histones. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} and any other hereditary information found in the mitochondria, chloroplasts, or other locations is collectively known as a cell's genome. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is localized in the cell nucleus, or with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its genotype.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the west}} coast of Africa on September 23, and merged with the southern end of a decaying frontal system over the Caribbean Sea. The combined disturbance gradually split, with the northernmost section eventually becoming Tropical Storm Marco. The southernmost end moved into the eastern Pacific, which then immediately showed signs of organization. The system stalled just south of El Salvador throughout October 5, where it came under the influence of strong vertical wind shear. The circulation slowly drifted east-northeastward and became absorbed by a neighboring tropical wave, with the broad resultant low re-curving to the west-northwest. In response to relaxing shear aloft, convection redeveloped around the newly formed center of circulation. It subsequently acquired a sufficiently <b>organized</b> <b>structure</b> and post-analysis found that a tropical depression formed at around 1200UTC on October8. Upon developing, the depression was designated as Sixteen-E about 120mi (195km) south-southwest of San Salvador, El Salvador, and operationally, advisories were initiated at 2100UTC — 9 hours after post-analytic estimates of formation.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} depression quickly intensified into early on September 25 {{as the system}} continued to organize, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karen that morning. The strengthening trend was temporarily halted, and Karen remained a weak tropical storm with relatively shallow convection. Late that evening, new bursts of deep convection developed with the storm. Early on September 26, Karen intensified significantly and an inner core began to develop. That morning, a ragged eye developed and the system strengthened into a hurricane with 75mph (120km/h) winds. The intensification trend was short-lived, and the storm leveled off that afternoon as upper-level wind shear increased substantially due {{to the presence of}} a nearby tropical upper tropospheric trough. The storm became less organized that evening. Hurricane Karen weakened to a tropical storm as flight data from NOAA Hurricane Hunters confirmed surface winds of 72mph (115km/h) and a very large wind field late that evening. Operationally, Karen was classified as a strong tropical storm, but was reclassified as a Category1 hurricane based on data from the reconnaissance flight late on September 26and the less <b>organized</b> <b>structure</b> of the storm at that time.|$|E

25|$|By June 3, {{a surface}} low formed off {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather that existed several hundred miles south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico {{during the first few}} days of June. Slow development of this system was anticipated by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Remaining nearly stationary, it managed to produce a few disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Favorable environmental conditions allowed gradual organization, and convection became better defined on June5. It subsequently acquired sufficiently <b>organized</b> <b>structure</b> to be recognized as a tropical cyclone and NHC initiated advisories on the newly formed tropical depression One-E at 1200UTC, June7 while it was located around 365mi (590km) south of Acapulco, Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Hurricane Adrian was an intense, albeit {{short-lived}} early-season {{category 4}} hurricane that took part during the 2011 Pacific hurricane season. Adrian originated {{from an area}} of disturbed weather which had developed {{during the course of}} early June, off the Pacific coast of Mexico. On June 7, it acquired a sufficiently <b>organized</b> <b>structure</b> with deep convection to be classified as a tropical cyclone, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) designated it as Tropical Depression One-E, the first one of 2011. It further strengthened to be upgraded into a tropical storm later that day. Adrian moved rather slowly; briefly recurving northward after being caught in the steering winds. After steady intensification, it was upgraded into a hurricane on June 9. The storm subsequently entered a phase of rapid intensification, developing a distinct eye with good outflow in all quadrants. Followed by this period of rapid intensification, it obtained sustained winds fast enough to be considered a major hurricane and reached its peak intensity as a category 4 hurricane that evening.|$|E
25|$|The IDF traces {{its roots}} to Jewish {{paramilitary}} {{organizations in the}} New Yishuv, starting with the Second Aliyah (1904 to 1914). The first such organization was Bar-Giora, founded in September 1907. Bar-Giora was transformed into Hashomer in April 1909, which operated until the British Mandate of Palestine came into being in 1920. Hashomer was an elitist organization with narrow scope, and was mainly created to protect against criminal gangs seeking to steal property. The Zion Mule Corps and the Jewish Legion, both part of the British Army of World War I, would further bolster the Yishuv with military experience and manpower, forming the basis for later paramilitary forces. After the 1920 Palestine riots against Jews in April 1920, the Yishuv leadership realised {{the need for a}} nationwide underground defense organization, and the Haganah was founded in June of the same year. The Haganah became a full-scale defense force after the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine with an <b>organized</b> <b>structure,</b> consisting of three main units—the Field Corps, Guard Corps, and the Palmach. During World War II, the Yishuv participated in the British war effort, culminating {{in the formation of the}} Jewish Brigade. These would eventually form the backbone of the Israel Defense Forces, and provide it with its initial manpower and doctrine.|$|E

A particular emphasis is given to those organized motions believed to be responsible for the turbulence production process in the wall region, and hence, indirectly responsible for the viscous drag. Examples are selected to illustrate how the analyses of numerically generated databases have contributed to improve our understanding of the <b>organized</b> <b>structures</b> of turbulent boundary layers. In the second part, results from an exploratory study based on the direct numerical simulation of the concepts for active control of turbulent boundary layers are presented. A significant drag reduction is achieved when the surface boundary condition is modified such that it could suppress the organized motion in the wall region. This drag reduction is accompanied by a significant reduction in the intensity of the <b>organized</b> <b>structures</b> and in the magnitude of Reynolds stresses throughout the flow...|$|R
40|$|The Roma {{are not a}} bounded {{internally}} homogene~us community {{possessing a}} stable group identity. They are a transnational minority without a kin state [...] which continue to. be the most marginalized. and discriminated ethnic group in Europe. This thesis asks: 'Who Speaks for the Roma?' In doing so it analyses <b>organizing</b> <b>structures</b> of representation in domestic and transnational political contexts arguing that these structures articulate the shared interests of the Romani community. Whilst the role of state structure. s and international organizations is acknowledged they are ultimately downplayed in favour of representation structures which the Roma social movement create themselves. The thesis examines three types of <b>organizing</b> <b>structures</b> of representation in Hungary and Romania which claim to legitimately represent {{the interests of the}} Roma: elites; political parties; and civil society organizations. The investigation then asks whether transnational <b>organizing.</b> <b>structures</b> of representation can legitimately claim to represent the Roma: transnational advocacy networks; International Romani non-governmental organizations; and the European Roma' and Traveller Forum. The Roma social movement creates these representation structures with reference to their ethnic group identity. The purpose of these <b>organizing</b> <b>structures</b> of representation is to articulate the shared interests of the Romani community which are necessarily suppressed by the utilitarian principles of liberal democratic polities. However not all those who claim to represent the interests of the Roma do so legitimately, thus this thesis determines how legitimate these <b>organizing</b> <b>structures</b> of representation actually are. Theoretically this thesis seeks to advance understandings of the complex relationship between ethnic mobilization, interest articulation, and legitimate representation with regard to minorities, and empirically it details the case of Romani political participation in Hungary and Romania, as well as the transnational political context.

25|$|Moving {{towards the}} west-northwest and already near the United States Gulf Coast, the NHC's {{official}} forecast {{at the time}} of Bill's formation indicated that the storm would not have much time to strengthen over water. However, meteorologists Jeff Masters and Bob Henson of Weather Underground noted the possibility of Bill strengthening over land via the brown ocean effect due to floods in the previous month that helped saturate soils in Texas and Oklahoma. The cyclone's organization remained steady as the storm approached the coast, with most of the convection taking place around the storm's eastern half, with rainbands primarily occupying the eastern and southern portions of Bill's circulation. At 15:00UTC on June16, Bill reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997mbar (hPa; 29.44inHg) as the storm was located 15mi (20km) south of Port O'Connor, Texas. At peak intensity, Bill made landfall on Matagorda Island at 16:45UTC and began moving into inland Texas. At 09:00UTC on June17, Bill was downgraded to tropical depression intensity, though it maintained an <b>organized</b> <b>structure.</b> The next day, Bill had rapidly deteriorated as it moved northeastward. However, the system's strength slowly weakened. Operationally, it was announced that Bill stayed tropical throughout most of its lifetime, being declared a remnant low on June 20 by the WPC, however the NHC's post storm analysis revealed that Bill had degraded into a remnant low on June 18, while the storm was situated over Tulsa, Oklahoma. Bill's remnant low continued to move eastward for several more days, before being absorbed by another extratropical system on June 23.|$|E
25|$|When, in August 1980, Anna Walentynowicz {{lost her}} job at the Gdańsk Shipyard because of her {{position}} as editor of the underground newspaper Robotnik Wybrzeze, her fellow workers took action. Around 16,000 employees of the shipyard discontinued their work and occupied its premises on the morning of August 14, demanding Walentynowicz’s re-employment, the erection of a monument in honor of the victims of the strikes of 1970, and a pay rise of 2000 zlotys, amongst other things. After negotiating with management and having most of their demands met, a vote was taken on August 16 leading to the strike being called off. By this time, however, many of the workers at facilities surrounding the Gdańsk Shipyard had begun their own strikes making similar demands, and it was decided that in solidarity with them, the workers in the shipyard would continue to strike despite their own demands having been met. By the next morning the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Polish shorthand: MKS) had been formed within the gates of the shipyard, intending to unite workers in the Gdańsk-Sopot-Gdynia area, coordinating action and maintaining and order {{to ensure the safety of}} the strikers. Lech Wałęsa, an electrician who had lost his job at the Gdańsk Shipyard in the strikes of 1976 was elected as chair of the MKS, while the remainder of the committee was composed of delegates from other facilities including Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda, and others. By August 18, the MKS represented workers from 156 separate enterprises, and the number was steadily growing. Just two days after the formation of MKS the Polish economy was brought to a standstill as workers struck at factories and ports all along the Baltic coast. By August 21, much of the country was affected by strikes, even including the inland mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area, as more and more workers joined independent unions. The Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee at Gdańsk was becoming the national center for trade union movement: a phenomenon which was itself unique to this series of events. In the strikes of the 1950s and ‘70s it was the lack of a central <b>organized</b> <b>structure</b> that had limited the mobilization potential of striking workers. Now the MKS had been specifically designed with this problem in mind - the decentralization of the workers’ movement – and was working for the first time to unify and strengthen the movement, coordinating strikes all across Poland. It was for this reason that the government of Edward Gierek found they could no longer buy off strikers with small concessions, and finally had to settle into heavy negotiations with the MKS.|$|E

In post-analysis, it was determined that Arthur had developed more than 12hours earlier, late on May 30, and made landfall early on May 31 with 45mph (75km/h) winds in northeastern Belize. While over land, Arthur maintained minimal tropical storm force winds, concentrated primarily over open waters to the east and northeast. Despite being over land for several hours, the storm maintained a fairly <b>organized</b> <b>structure.</b> The storm contained a large low-level center, accompanied by convective banding, and was developing new convective cells.

The city began to host a monthly event known as [...] "Bike Miami", where major streets in Downtown and Brickell were closed to automobiles, and left open for pedestrians, bicyclists, and other human powered transportation. The event began in November 2008, and doubled in popularity from 1,500 participants to about 3,000 in the October 2009 Bike Miami. This event differed from Critical Mass as streets were officially closed by authorities. Now known as Critical Mass Miami, the event is held on the last Friday evening of every month.
