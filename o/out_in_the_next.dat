The writers could not script a convincing story for why Emily would not be seen, despite being married to Ross, so Baxendale was written <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> season, making only three cameo appearances after the season premiere.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test, England {{amassed a}} big first innings score and looked likely to win, but Stan McCabe made 232 for Australia, a {{performance}} Bradman rated {{as the best}} he had ever seen. With Australia forced to follow-on, Bradman fought hard to ensure McCabe's effort was not in vain, and he secured the draw with 144 not out. It was the slowest Test hundred of his career and he played a similar innings of 102 not <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Test as Australia struggled to another draw. Rain completely washed out the Third Test at Old Trafford.|$|E

25|$|The {{information}} segment {{was introduced}} in Season 2. It consists of Lizzy Lovette and later Sally Stanton giving a brief report on a particular topic. Teams are asked a 10-point buzz-in question on the topic {{to make sure they}} were listening. Initially the team who correctly answered the question also won the right to be the first team to get their question round, but was later dropped. No points are lost if a team answers the question incorrectly, but will be locked <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> question.

25|$|First, he bowled a {{ball that}} Atapattu found prudent to leave alone, and nearly knocked down the off-stump of the Sri Lankan captain. Two balls later, a ball {{moving away from}} the batsman found the outside edge, and Atapattu was gone for 11. Jayasuriya was nearly run <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> over, before {{perishing}} lbw, and Rasel and Shahadat then got two balls to nip back in and crash into the batsmen's stumps.

25|$|When the First Ottoman–Venetian War broke <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year, {{the former}} Gattilusio domains were an obvious {{target for the}} Christian fleets. But {{although}} the Venetians captured Lemnos in 1464, followed by Imbros, Tenedos, and Samothrace, these conquests proved ephemeral, as they were either recaptured by the Turks or abandoned at war's end. In April 1464, the Venetians under Orsato Giustiniano laid siege to Mytilene, but were forced to withdraw after six weeks of fruitless attacks, taking {{as many of the}} Christian inhabitants with them as they could. The island remained under Ottoman rule for four and a half centuries, until captured by the Kingdom of Greece on 22 November 1912, during the First Balkan War.|$|E

25|$|Burke was {{selected}} for an Australian Second XI that toured New Zealand {{under the leadership of}} Bill Brown {{at the end of the}} season, with the first-choice team still in South Africa. He started his career for Australia productively, scoring 101 in a non-first-class match against Hutt Valley on debut. Burke then scored 60 and 68 not <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> match against Auckland—a first-class fixture—before taking 3/24 in the second innings as the hosts held on for a draw with two wickets in hand. He scored 89 in the next match against Waikato—another non-first-class match—but did little else on the tour. He failed to take another wicket and passed 20 only once in his five remaining first-class innings. He made nine in his only innings in the one-off match against New Zealand, which was drawn.|$|E
25|$|Dunning was {{nominated}} by the Democratic party {{to run for}} Congress in 1856, but he declined primarily due to the fractured nature of the party at that time. He, along with {{a large part of}} the party, was at odds with its state leadership who were sympathetic to the south. In 1860 he did accept a nomination to be a delegate to the party's convention in Charleston, South Carolina, and the second convention held in Baltimore. In both convention he voted in favor of Stephen Douglas, and favored compromise on the slavery issue. When the American Civil War finally broke <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year, Dunning publicly declared himself for the Union and set to work raising companies of men for the war effort. In the end, he was personally responsible to the recruitment of nearly two full regiments of men.|$|E
25|$|Match VII: Playing their 4th {{match in}} their home ground, CSK once again lost the toss was asked to bowl by the Rajasthan Royals captain Rahul Dravid. Batting first, RR off to a flier with Watson going all guns blazing. Though one side wickets were sliding, RR reached 185 helped by a {{magnificent}} century by Watson and some late power-hits by Stuart Binny. CSK while chasing lost Vijay cheaply once again within the Powerplays. With some fluent hits by Michael Hussey and heavy shots by RainaRaina consolidating the middle overs, CSK reached 100 in the 11th over. With Raina getting out for 55, Hussey going for well played 88 and Jadeja getting <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> ball, CSK once again went into the danger zone. However MSD's cameo fireworks and Dwayne Bravo's last over heroics helped CSK win the match with a ball to spare. Hussey was awarded MoM for his match-winning 88 runs off 51 balls.|$|E

25|$|The Australian captain Ricky Ponting {{brought on}} {{part-time}} spinner Michael Clarke to bowl the 11th over, and got immediate success, when Pietersen launched him to Matthew Hayden {{on the fifth}} ball, but England were still 101 for 3 after 11 overs. In the next over, the new batsman Michael Vaughan edged Andrew Symonds' ball to midwicket, and the pressure was suddenly on the English. With Trescothick out for 41 a bit later to an attempted sweep off Symonds, England were suddenly looking down a hole after a fine start, and Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood slowed the scoring, to see England 111 for 5 with six overs to play. However, a slog sweep from Collingwood to end the 15th over turned the match again, as it went away for six and England moved to 124 for 5. With Jason Gillespie being brought back, Collingwood led the charge, as England stole 17 runs off the 17th over and wrought control of the game again. Despite Andrew Strauss being bowled by Gillespie for 18, Collingwood hit another two boundaries {{towards the end of}} the over, to move onto 42 not out and the team score to 167 for 6. Vikram Solanki was <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> over for 9, caught by Hussey off McGrath, and on the last ball, Collingwood was caught by for 46. Still, England would be pleased with 179 for 8, the highest score on the Rose Bowl in Twenty20 matches.|$|E
25|$|Pietersen had a less {{successful}} {{time in the}} three Test matches against Pakistan, which England lost 2–0. He made little impact {{in the first and}} third test. His first Test match innings since his match winning 158 against Australia was brief as he was caught at short leg for 5. In the second innings, he was criticised for his dismissal. Chasing just 198, he was caught behind after a horrible slog on 19 as England went on to lose by 22 runs. In the third test, he made 34 before edging behind in the first innings. With England in difficulty, Pietersen edged Danish Kaneria to short leg when only on one, as England were to be defeated by an innings. He fared better in the second, however, making his second Test century in the first innings. He brought up his hundred with a six before next ball, he top-edged a pull and was <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> innings, with England needing to bat out a draw, England were 20–4 but he made 42 to help England get the draw. He was also performing well in the one-day series with two explosive innings of 56 from 39 balls to help England win the first ODI, and 28 from 27 balls in the second. The quick-scoring innings in the second ODI was to be Pietersen's last on the tour. A rib injury sustained in the first ODI proved too painful throughout the second, and Pietersen returned to England to recover fully for the tour of India.|$|E
25|$|The third {{game of the}} Series {{was delayed}} {{for an hour and}} 31 minutes because of rain. Country music star Tim McGraw, son of Phillies {{reliever}} Tug McGraw, spread his father's ashes on the pitching mound of Citizens Bank Park, prior to the game's start. The Phillies scored {{in the bottom of the}} first inning after Jimmy Rollins led off with a single and eventually scored when Chase Utley grounded <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> half inning, Tampa Bay's Carl Crawford doubled, stole third base and scored on a Gabe Gross sacrifice fly to center field. Carlos Ruiz gave the Phillies their second lead of the night when he hit a solo home run in the bottom of the second inning. Starting pitchers Matt Garza and Jamie Moyer pitched six and 6⅓ innings respectively. The 2–1 score remained unchanged until the sixth inning when Chase Utley and Ryan Howard hit the 14th back-to-back home runs in World Series history. Crawford scored his second run of the game in the top of the seventh inning when he was batted in by Gross again. Dioner Navarro continued the rally by scoring on a Jason Bartlett ground out—bringing the score to 4–3. In the top of the eighth inning, B.J. Upton led off with a single, stole second and third, and scored on a throwing error to tie the game. Eric Bruntlett was hit by a pitch leading off the bottom of the ninth, moved to second on a wild pitch and to third on a throwing error. Tampa Bay intentionally walked the next two batters to load the bases, creating a force play at the plate. They then brought the infield in (including right fielder Ben Zobrist who was brought in to be a fifth infielder) hoping to convert any groundball into a force out at home and preventing the game winning run. However, Bruntlett scored the winning run on Ruiz's 45-foot infield single, the first walk-off infield single in World Series history, giving the Phillies a 2–1 lead in the series.|$|E
25|$|As reigning champions, Leicestershire {{were the}} side to beat. Nottinghamshire tried first, and failed, losing by 5 wickets, with Nixon hitting an {{impressive}} 32 not out to help see them off. A loss against Derbyshire followed, although Nixon still contributed 16 and two catches. However, Leicestershire were soon back to winning ways against Durham, triumphing by 3 runs with Nixon hitting 11 off 11 balls. Lancashire ran <b>out</b> winners <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> game, with Nixon being dismissed for a duck.|$|R

25|$|The Dodgers {{began their}} first road trip {{of the second}} half of the season in New York City against the Mets on July 20. Kemp and Luis Cruz each slugged two-run homers off Mets starter Johan Santana and the team held on for a 7-6 victory. Juan Uribe, who had {{struggled}} in the first half of the season, broke <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> game, with a homer, double, two walks, four RBI and three runs scored. Chris Capuano picked up his team leading 10th win in the 8–5 victory. Matt Treanor's pinch hit two-run single in the top of the 12th inning led the Dodgers to an 8–3 victory over the Mets on July 22. The win completed the Dodgers first 3-game series sweep of the Mets in New York since 2002 and gave rookie Josh Wall the win. Wall was the first Dodger to pick up a win in relief in his first appearance since Tim Belcher in 1987. Billingsley came off the disabled list to pitch six solid innings in the Dodgers 5–3 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on July 24. Luis Cruz's three-run homer was main offense in the game. Kershaw struggled in the next game, allowing 8 earned runs, in the Dodgers 8–2 loss to the Cardinals that ended the five-game winning streak. The Dodgers acquired Hanley Ramírez from the Miami Marlins in a trade on July 25 and Ramírez went 2-for-4 with a triple in his Dodgers debut against the Cardinals. It wasn't enough, however, as ex-Dodger Rafael Furcal hit a two-out single to left in the bottom of the 12th to give the Cardinals a 3–2 victory. Chris Capuano turned in his worst start of the season in the finale against the Cardinals, as the Dodgers lost 7–4. Ramírez hit his first home run as a Dodger in the opener of a key series against the division leading Giants. The two-run homer, in the top of the 10th inning was the difference in a 5-3 victory. The Dodgers picked up another win against their rivals the next day as Chad Billingsley pitched 7 scoreless innings while allowing only 4 hits and Matt Kemp went 4 for 5 with two doubles and a home run in the 10–0 rout. Kershaw pitched a five-hit complete game shutout to complete the Dodgers sweep of the Giants, 4–0, and move them back into a tie for first place in the division.|$|E
500|$|Colleen McCullough {{is another}} author who {{incorporates}} both the medieval Achilles' seeking Troilus out in battle {{and the ancient}} butchery at the altar. Her The Song of Troy includes two characters, Troilos and Ilios, who are Priam's youngest children – both with prophecies attached and both specifically named for the city's founders. They are eight and seven respectively when Paris leaves for Greece and somewhere {{in their late teens}} when killed. Troilos is made Priam's heir after Hector's death, against the boy's will. Odysseus's spies learn of the prophecy that Troy will not fall if Troilos comes of age. Achilles therefore seeks him <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> battle and kills him with a spear-cast to his throat. In a reference to the medieval concept of Troilus as the second Hector, Automedon observes that [...] "with a few more years added, he might have made another Hektor." [...] Ilios is the last son of Priam to die, killed at the altar in front of his parents by Neoptolemos.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{features}} a reappearance by Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill), a recurring character during the first season. The second season DVD includes an alternate ending to this episode, which was released around the airing of the episode as a promotional tool. The alternate ending starts {{the same way as}} the regular ending, with Veronica discovering that Meg is pregnant. But instead of the episode ending there, Meg's mom comes into the room while Veronica hides in the bathroom. When the mom leaves, Meg is dead with a pillow over her face, indicating smothering. However, Veronica takes the pillow off before a nurse comes in. Thomas commented that the alternate ending was never going to be the actual conclusion to the episode. He said: [...] "We never seriously considered having that be the ending. There were various other endings that we did have, but they were so subtly different, it was like, 'When does Veronica enter the room?'" [...] The idea to promote the alternate ending was a joint venture from the UPN promotions department and executive producer Joel Silver. After Thomas learned that others wanted an alternate ending, he decided to make it very different from the episode's actual conclusion. [...] "But once we could have a [...] alternate ending, we thought, 'Let's make it rock.' The beauty of having that alternate ending is that we don't have to play it <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> episode." ...|$|E
