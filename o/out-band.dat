30|$|Three {{relay node}} modes of {{operation}} (resource partitioning schemes) have been considered: in-band, <b>out-band,</b> and hybrid. From the three schemes, the in-band configuration introduces additional delay, and is burdened with time domain multiplexing overhead and restrictions in resource assignment. It is, however, the only solution possible in case of single-carrier operation. <b>Out-band</b> configuration overcomes weak points of the in-band configuration, but it is most useful in case of systems with high number of carriers and with CA technique implemented. Finally, the hybrid configuration brings together advantages of the in-band and <b>out-band</b> configurations. It is recommended for multi-carrier systems with low number of carriers available (e.g., only two carriers).|$|E

30|$|In this study, we have {{analysed}} {{the problem}} of resource allocation in REN. First, we have studied {{the problem of}} resource partitioning between the backhaul and the direct links. For the <b>out-band</b> and the in-band relay scenarios, we investigated and evaluated different partitioning strategies. While {{in both cases the}} Fair-RU scheme seems to be too aggressive from a macro UE perspective the Fair-TP refrains from allocating excessive resources to the backhaul link. Furthermore, the Ext-Prop-Fair strategy for the <b>out-band</b> relays manages to improve further the performance of the R-UEs compared to the Fair-TP with minimal impact in the performance of the M-UEs.|$|E
3000|$|... should {{actually}} be neither {{too large to}} avoid serious ripples in the pass band nor too small in case that the designed waveform has an obvious <b>out-band</b> leakage which may interfere PU in adjacent band [35].|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, for the <b>out-band</b> relays, a {{distinct}} carrier {{is used to}} separate the backhaul and the access links. This can practically be implemented by exploiting the feature of carrier aggregation. Carrier aggregation in LTE-A expands the total available bandwidth by allowing the users to use several carries {{at the same time}} thereby increasing the achievable data rates[23]. For <b>out-band</b> relay operation, carrier aggregation appears to offer an interesting option to multiplex the backhaul and the access links: while the direct link is scheduled on all available carriers, the backhaul link is limited to a certain subset of them. Meanwhile, the relay access link must be scheduled on the carriers complementary to the backhaul link set.|$|E
3000|$|... [*]Separation of the RN BH and AC {{transmissions}} {{by either}} allocation of orthogonal radio resources (e.g., frequency carriers {{as in the}} <b>out-band</b> relaying [3, 22]) or by separation of the RN AC and BH antennas (e.g., by usage of directional antennas or antenna displacement).|$|E
30|$|For the {{simulations}} involving in-band relays, a bandwidth of 10 + 10 MHz is configured {{while for}} the <b>out-band</b> relays 2 carries of 5 + 5 MHz are used. This definition of the bandwidth allows us for direct and fair comparison between the results.|$|E
30|$|The <b>out-band</b> {{relaying}} {{can provide}} certain gains over the in-band relaying scheme: a throughput gain {{in case of}} non-adjacent carrier allocation because of the overhead introduced by the in-band relaying operation and the lower retransmission delay as explained in Section 3.2. 1. However, {{if the number of}} carriers available in the system is low (e.g., two carriers), the available carrier sizes may not give sufficient flexibility for an efficient resource partitioning in frequency domain. In such case a useful approach may be the hybrid relaying mode [40]. In this configuration, RN utilizes one or more carriers with the in-band partitioning for both backhaul and access links, and in addition can utilize other carrier(s) for the <b>out-band</b> backhaul and/or access link operation.|$|E
30|$|The {{access link}} has a {{bandwidth}} of 10 and 5 MHz for in-band and <b>out-band</b> relay cases, respectively. Note {{that for the}} DeNB-RN link, we assume a gain of 5 dB {{to account for the}} assumption that a relay has better reception conditions than a regular UE[21].|$|E

The <b>out-band</b> attenuation can be further optimized after total 100 iterations. Therefore, our proposed network has a fast convergence. Consequently, the switching time can be considerably shortened. Hence, with little accessing delay, the utilization of idle spectrum can be enhanced.|$|E
30|$|Finally, we {{have chosen}} to also use two types of discrete-time-optimized {{orthogonal}} filters published in [20]. The first one is designed {{in order to minimize}} <b>out-band</b> energy (OBE), and the second one maximizes time–frequency localization (TFL). They also have the property of having a minimal time duration. With a proper adaption as described previously, they lead to tight frames.|$|E
30|$|The hybrid {{partitioning}} scheme {{combines the}} advantages of both the in-band and <b>out-band</b> partitioning schemes, {{at the same time}} minimizing their disadvantages. Specifically, the flexibility of in-band resource partitioning is available as well as the protection against the loop interference from adjacent carriers while the secondary backhaul carriers enable lower retransmission delay for delay sensitive traffic.|$|E
40|$|Aiming at {{the digital}} {{quadrature}} modulation system, a mathematical Pan-function {{model of the}} optimized baseband symbol signals with a symbol length of 4 T was established {{in accordance with the}} minimum <b>out-band</b> energy radiation criterion. The intersymbol interference (ISI), symbol-correlated characteristics, and attenuation factor were introduced to establish the mathematical Pan-function model. The Pan-function was added to the constraints of boundary conditions, energy of a single baseband symbol signal, and constant-envelope conditions. Baseband symbol signals with the optimum efficient spectrum were obtained by introducing Fourier series and minimizing the Pan-function. The characteristics of the spectrum and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the obtained signals were analyzed and compared with the minimum shift keying (MSK) and quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) signals. The obtained signals have the characteristics of a higher spectral roll-off rate, less <b>out-band</b> radiation, and quasi-constant envelope. We simulated the performance of the obtained signals, and the simulation results demonstrate that the method is feasible...|$|E
30|$|Finally, REN with {{carriers}} aggregation is studied in[13, 14]. In these contributions, Gora et al. {{compare the}} performance of in-band relays and <b>out-band</b> relays with carrier aggregation. But their work also does not consider resource partition between the direct link and the backhaul link. Moreover, {{none of the above}} cited work[8 – 14] considers QoS support for users while designing the resource allocation schemes.|$|E
30|$|Typically, two backhaul-access link {{resource}} partitioning schemes {{are considered}} for RNs. Those are resource partitioning {{in time and}} frequency domain that correspond to in-band and <b>out-band</b> operations, respectively. In addition, also the so-called hybrid or mixed configuration can be used, as discussed in [40]. Each of the partitioning schemes brings restrictions to resource assignment for RNs, those restrictions are discussed next considering the resource allocation criteria derived in Section 3.2.|$|E
30|$|In {{presence}} of an RN, the radio resources at the DeNB are shared between the backhaul link and the direct link. This happens {{in the context of}} both in-band and <b>out-band</b> modes of relay operation (as described later). A crucial task here is to decide on how the resources are going to be shared, i.e., how many resources should be assigned for backhaul transmission and how many should be used for the direct link.|$|E

30|$|A third {{resource}} partitioning strategy proposed in[19] targeting <b>out-band</b> relays {{is the so-called}} extended proportional-fair (Ext-Prop-Fair) strategy. In this strategy, the RN {{is viewed as a}} normal UE {{from the perspective of the}} scheduler. Nevertheless, the usual Prop-Fair metric is scaled with the number of attached R-UEs, i.e., after the proportional fair metric has been estimated for the backhaul link, the metric is linearly scaled by the number of R-UEs connected to the respective RN.|$|E

30|$|We {{conclude}} that, for the <b>out-band</b> case, the Ext-Prop-Fair {{appears as}} the best alternative for the resource partitioning: It manages to increase {{the performance of the}} R-UEs, as compared to the DeNB-only case, while having low impact on the performance of the direct link. The same argument is valid to conclude that the preferable strategy for the in-band relay case is the Fair-TP. The results demonstrate that an efficient multiplexing of the backhaul link improves the system performance by relaying the cell-edge users while having minimal impact on the throughput of the macro users.|$|E

30|$|As {{defined by}} the 3 GPP, the {{separation}} of the wireless backhaul and access links can be provided by either sufficient shielding and separation in space between the backhaul and access link antennas (Type- 1 b) or by resource partitioning, i.e., operating the two links on different radio resources. The backhaul-access link resource partitioning can be done in time domain (basic Type- 1, in-band) or in frequency domain (Type- 1 a, <b>out-band).</b> As the shielding and in-space separation are applicable only in specific cases, e.g., an indoor RN with an outdoor backhaul link antenna, the resource partitioning-based solutions are typically considered.|$|E

30|$|The {{issue of}} {{interference}} on the RN backhaul link was noticed in [51], and in [52] a grouping based solution for minimizing interference between single-carrier operated in-band RNs was proposed. In [53], ICIC solutions for multi-carrier operated <b>out-band</b> RNs based on coordinated hard frequency reuse carrier allocation are proposed. The ICIC approach proposed in [53] is centralized, i.e., {{it assumes that}} the DeNB fully controls carrier allocation for backhaul and access links of all connected RNs. In [16], similar solutions are also proposed, however, assuming distributed and autonomous control, i.e., shifting {{of some of the}} decisions to RNs. In this article, further enhancements and evaluations of the centralized solution are presented.|$|E

30|$|The PAPR {{indicates}} {{how much}} the signal peak power {{is higher than the}} mean power value. A signal with high PAPR exhibits high dynamic range. Consequently, this poses a challenge to the analog components of the front end which may introduce distortions.

In turn, unintentional <b>out-band</b> interference due to spurious emissions is generated as well as the signal distortion may cause a performance loss in the receiver stage. In OFDM, the high PAPR is a known drawback. It grows exponentially with the sub-channel number [24]. Generally, the PAPR cannot be expressed in closed-form.|$|E
