40|$|Residues 2, 6, 8 and 10 of Mnt {{repressor}} are {{the major}} determinants of operator DNA binding and recognition. Here, we investigate the interaction of wild-type Mnt and mutants bearing the Arg 2 [...] Lys, His 6 [...] Ala, Asn 8 [...] Ala and Arg 10 [...] Lys mutations with operator DNA modified by methylation or by symmetric base substitutions. The wild-type pattern of methylation interference is altered in specific ways {{for each of the}} mutant proteins. In addition, some of the mutant proteins show a 'loss of contact' phenotype with specific mutant operators. Taken together, these and previous results predict the following contacts between side chains in the Mnt tetramer and operator DNA: Arg 2 recognizes the guanines at <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> 10 and 12; His 6 contacts the guanines at <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> 5 and 17; Asn 8 contacts <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> 4, 7, 15 and 18; Arg 10 contacts the guanines at <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> 8 and 14.

50|$|In {{terms of}} <b>{{operator}}</b> <b>position,</b> an operator may be prefix, postfix, or infix. A prefix operator immediately precedes its operand, as in −x. A postfix operator immediately succeeds its operand, as in x! for instance. An infix operator is positioned in between a left and a right operand, as in x+y. Some languages, {{most notably the}} C-syntax family, stretches this conventional terminology and speaks also of ternary infix operators (a?b:c). Theoretically it would even be possible (but not necessarily practical) to define parenthesization as a unary bifix operation.|$|E
50|$|The Class 5 switch {{system for}} Traffic <b>Operator</b> <b>Position</b> System (TOPS) enables the {{definition}} of up to 255 unique s of calls to operators—and up to 255 unique profiles defining the responsibilities of operators and teams, that is, the queues from which they can draw calls. This technology was first introduced in the DMS 200/300. Previously, only four queues were available, all straight-line models, forecasted with Erlang distribution algorithms and table look-ups. Now, {{a vast array of}} queues were available, with variable grades of service, served by multiple queues of operators in both primary and secondary capacity. The lookup tables were no longer capable of forecasting for this complex queueing environment.|$|E

Trans East Airlines also operated the airports at Bethel, New York, and Bangor, Maine. Their head office was at 555 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York.

50|$|While interning {{ran into}} WCSX DJ John O’Leary and {{was offered the}} {{opportunity}} to help out on his Saturday night show. It soon became a regular Saturday night thing that lasted {{until the end of}} his time at Specs Howard. Eric graduated from Specs Howard in June 2006. Once graduated from Specs Eric made the choice to forgo searching for a radio job right away to instead pursue a filming project he had been involved in with a group of friends that called themselves The Renegade Tube Team. That sucked so he once again turned his attention to his first passion, radio. Being out of Specs for a few years he knew he needed something fresh for his resume {{in order to get the}} attention of radio stations. In a last ditch effort, he messaged several radio stations on Facebook. One of them was producer of The Drew and Mike show Mike Wolters. Mike was the only one to get back and soon Eric was again an intern at Greeter Media but this time for his radio hero's the Drew and Mike morning show. Eric's internship for the Drew and Mike show for almost ended up lasting about a year and a half. During this time his strange and awkward personality eventually led him getting on the air on a regular basis. During his internship with Drew and Mike he finished up classes at Oakland Community College, earning his associates in broadcast communications. He started sending out resumes for jobs in radio all over the country. Eventually he would except a board <b>operator</b> <b>position</b> at a small AM/FM station in Holland, MI.|$|E
