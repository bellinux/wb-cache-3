DOE- 2 simulates systems on an hour-by-hour basis, so the correlations {{are intended to}} predict part load energy use (and efficiency) {{as a function of}} the part load ratio (PLR) for each hour, where PLR = Hourly Load/Available Capacity.

40|$|Abstract:- The use of Nitinol wires as {{actuators}} {{is becoming}} more common {{and a number of}} applications such as endovascular stents and the small walking Stikito robots are well known. The thermodynamic and electrical characteristics associated with the strain generation are examined and a novel control strategy developed to optimise the strain response. The actuation time for both <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> <b>operations</b> can be minimised by using a low level constant current through the Nitinol actuator to determine the Nitinol wire resistance, and hence the strain state. In this way, the effects of voltage supply and ambient temperature fluctuations can be measured and allowed for. The result is a simple 4 state machine controller that uses timed <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> states together with an adjustable PWM setting to achieve minimum times for <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> strain changes.

40|$|Abstract — Power MOSFET is a voltage-controlled device {{generally}} {{used for}} switching purpose. To get the MOSFET in operation, appropriate voltage {{should be applied}} to the gatesource terminal. The <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> <b>operation</b> of MOSFET depends upon the charging and discharging behaviour of the parasitic capacitances. For low frequency, a normal pulse generating circuit without a driver is suitable but the switching losses can be an issue of concern. A suitable driver circuit is required for the proper switching at high frequency. This paper describes the practical observation for a switching circuit containing RL load and Power MOSFET in two different cases- with driver circuit and without driver circuit at two different switching frequencies (Low- 50 Hz and High...|$|R

40|$|In the {{industrial}} sector the various motoring loads are continuously running and generating the inductive load. So the power factor in this system gets reduced due to the inductive reactive power. But the electricity board has a standard limits regarding the power factor values and if the power factor goes below the specified limit; the electricity company charges the penalty to {{the industrial}} consumers. The automatic power factor correction panel provides the required compensation to overcome the inductive reactance by using the power capacitors. The microcontroller 8051 receives current signal from current transformer and simultaneously gives the signals to the various contactors to connect the capacitors in the line for the compensation. Thus by adding the capacitor to the line will compensate the reactive power and maintains the power factor near to unity. This will avoids the penalty to the industrial consumers and may get the incentives. In the conventional methods we were using the fixed capacitor for compensation. But these were leading to excessive charging of the capacitors causes the voltage surges. Thus it becomes difficult to main power factor near unity by <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> <b>operation</b> of fixed capacitor. The contactor switched capacitors are connected and disconnected automatically eliminating the previous problem...|$|R

Consideration of the application possibility of interface relay as mechanical switches, and {{the definition of the}} duration of the intervals to ensure coordination of the relay operation with semiconductor switches. Methodology. Experimental determination of the time intervals between the moments of switching transistor which controls the relay coil, and power transistor when the switching <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> <b>operations</b> using a hybrid switching device are performed; statistical processing of experimental results. Results. The durations of the time intervals between the moments of switching of semiconductor and mechanical switching elements in systems of actuator coils hybrid commutation are experimentally determined.

The scheme of the power circuit of the control system with hybrid commutation of the actuator coil circuit, which differs from the known schemes that the only semiconductor switching element performs functions of the current switching <b>on</b> and <b>off,</b> and electromechanical relay contact elements act as a router interconnecting electrical circuits during dead times.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} multicore machines creates {{an opportunity to}} expand {{on the notion of}} green computing. By expanding the overall goals of a general purpose scheduler to consider energy use, we were able to investigate the tradeoffs between execution time and power consumption in multicore commodity systems. Our method is {{based on the idea that}} at any given moment a computer does not necessarily utilize all of its cores. This creates an opportunity to reduce power consumption by effectively turning superfluous cores off. In this research, we describe an energy aware arbiter for multicore systems having the goal of minimizing energy while at the same time leveraging performance. We have devised an algorithm that turns off power to processing cores that have entered an idle state as a result of I/O blocking and/or process termination. We present our experiments as a function of the power needed to actually perform an <b>on</b> or <b>off</b> <b>operation</b> <b>on</b> an individual core. Since this functionality is not present in current technology this research serves as an indicator for CPU designers who wish to implement a power aware architecture. Our experiments show that we are able to diminish the total power used by the system by an order of magnitude with an approximate decrease in performance of 13 % in the worst case and less than 1 % in the best case. ...|$|R

40|$|Extracts of {{effluents}} from {{a modern}} residential oil burner {{have been evaluated}} in several toxicological assay systems. Bacterial mutagens were detected in extracts from both the particulate and vapor phase emissions. Effluents from continuous operation were {{an order of magnitude}} less mutagenic than those from cyclic (5 min <b>on,</b> 10 min <b>off)</b> <b>operations.</b> No difference in the yield of bacterial mutagens per gram of fuel burned was found between cyclic operation under low and moderate sooting conditions. On the basis of elution behavior from alumina it appeared that the bacterial mutagens collected from high sooting effluents were more polar than those from low sooting effluent. An extract that was mutagenic in bacteria did not induce a significant increase in mutation frequency to human lymphoblasts. No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in a limited number of newborn mice after IP injection of effluent extract when compared to historical control data. Putative nonmutagenic teratogens were detected in effluent using an attachment inhibition assay. The level of these agents was reduced in effluents from continuous oil burner operation...|$|R
