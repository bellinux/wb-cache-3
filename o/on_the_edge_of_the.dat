5|$|As {{a result}} of this turmoil, {{specific}} regions in mainland Greece witnessed a dramatic population decrease, especially Boeotia, Argolis and Messenia.

5|$|Aside {{from his}} run-scoring, Barnes, who {{was well known}} for being eccentric, gained fame {{throughout}} the season for his fielding at short leg—just a few metres from the batsman—where he took 19 catches for the season. Barnes stood much closer than others who fielded in the position, placing one foot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pitch. His extreme proximity prompted questions about the legitimacy of his action and English captain Norman Yardley later admitted that Barnes had intimidated his batsmen.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{marketed as}} holiday homes, {{many of the}} {{original}} houses became permanent residences due to post-war housing shortages in London and by 1950 {{there was a significant}} year-round population. Jaywick now includes large numbers of retired and unemployed people. A 2011 report in The Guardian found that 62% of working age residents in Jaywick received benefits, compared to 15% national average. A subsequent report in 2015 reiterated the area {{was one of the most}} deprived English neighbourhoods. According to the Citizens Advice Bureau, 40% of residents are unable to work due to a disability or long term illness. 60% of pupils at Frobisher Primary School, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village, receive free school meals.|$|E
5|$|During the Iron Age, Celtic culture, {{deriving}} from the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures, arrived from Central Europe. Brythonic was the spoken language during this time. Society was tribal; according to Ptolemy's Geographia there were around 20 tribes in the area. Earlier divisions are unknown because the Britons were not literate. Like other regions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading {{links with the}} Romans. Julius Caesar of the Roman Republic attempted to invade twice in 55BC; although largely unsuccessful, he managed {{to set up a}} client king from the Trinovantes.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{reduction}} in traffic caused by Cromer's decline in popularity as a holiday destination after World War II, and the closure of many Norfolk railway lines in the 1950s, {{a decision was made}} to concentrate all passenger traffic into a single station. Although Cromer High had far better facilities, it was inconveniently situated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town. Therefore, all passenger services were diverted into Cromer Beach (renamed Cromer) and the other stations closed. Following growth of the town as a commuter town to Norwich, a new station called Roughton Road opened in 1985, near the site of the former Cromer High.|$|E

A master plan was developed for the establishment of new residential, commercial, industrial and civic areas, and rapid development greatly increased the size and population of the town over a few decades.|$|E
