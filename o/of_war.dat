5|$|After the Belgian defeat, around 225,000 Belgian {{soldiers}} (around 30 {{percent of}} the total force mobilised in 1940) who had been made prisoners <b>of</b> <b>war</b> in 1940 were sent to prisoner <b>of</b> <b>war</b> camps in Germany. The majority of those in captivity (145,000) were Flemish, and 80,000 were Walloons. Most had been reservists, rather than professional soldiers, before the outbreak <b>of</b> <b>war</b> and their detention created a large labour shortage in civilian occupations.|$|E
5|$|Aphrodite– The Goddess of Love and Sexuality, and {{widow of}} Hephaestus. In God <b>of</b> <b>War,</b> Aphrodite helped Kratos by {{empowering}} {{the head of}} the slain Medusa and giving it to Kratos as a magical weapon. In God <b>of</b> <b>War</b> III, she offered advice regarding the architect Daedalus. After seducing Kratos, Aphrodite directed him to her estranged husband. She is the only god that Kratos did not kill that was present in God <b>of</b> <b>War</b> III. The character was voiced by Carole Ruggier in God <b>of</b> <b>War,</b> and April Stewart in God <b>of</b> <b>War</b> III.|$|E
5|$|Ares– The former God <b>of</b> <b>War</b> {{and main}} {{antagonist}} of God <b>of</b> <b>War.</b> Ares captured Kratos' brother Deimos {{and had him}} imprisoned and tortured due to a misinterpreted prophecy, and later chose Kratos as his champion during a successful wager with other Olympian Gods in the God <b>of</b> <b>War</b> comic series. Early on, Ares wanted to overthrow Zeus and entered into an alliance with the Furies to help him do so. Years later, as he deemed his own son Orkos unworthy, Ares saw an opportunity to create a warrior to help him. During a battle, Kratos called on the God <b>of</b> <b>War,</b> and pledged his life in servitude if Ares spared him from his foes and provided the power to destroy them. Ares granted Kratos' wish and empowered his new servant with the Blades of Chaos. A victorious Kratos eventually renounced his servitude to Ares when the god tricked Kratos into accidentally killing his own wife and child. In God <b>of</b> <b>War,</b> while Ares waged war on the city of Athens, Kratos was tasked by Athena to find Pandora's Box, an artifact capable of destroying Ares. Ultimately successful, Kratos ascended to Mount Olympus and replaced Ares as the new God <b>of</b> <b>War.</b> In Ascensions multiplayer mode, Ares {{is one of the}} four gods that players can pledge their allegiance to. The character was voiced by Steven Blum in God <b>of</b> <b>War,</b> Ghost of Sparta, and Ascension. Fred Tatasciore provided Ares' voice in God <b>of</b> <b>War</b> III during the psyche sequence.|$|E
