5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee <b>on</b> <b>Cancer),</b> none have been shown to be useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E

5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is toxic, and {{ingestion}} {{may lead}} to acute lead poisoning, as is applicable for all soluble lead compounds. All inorganic lead compounds are classified by the International Agency for Research <b>on</b> <b>Cancer</b> (IARC) as probably carcinogenic to humans (Category2A). They {{have been linked to}} renal cancer and glioma in experimental animals and to renal cancer, brain cancer and lung cancer in humans, although studies of workers exposed to lead are often complicated by concurrent exposure to arsenic. Lead is known to substitute for zinc in a number of enzymes, including δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (porphobilinogen synthase) in the haem biosynthetic pathway and pyrimidine-5′-nucleotidase, important for the correct metabolism of DNA and can therefore cause fetal damage.|$|E

40|$|The latest {{publication}} in the International Agency for Research <b>on</b> <b>Cancer’s</b> (IARC) series of Handbooks of Cancer Prevention is focused <b>on</b> breast <b>cancer</b> screening.

The decision to produce a handbook <b>on</b> breast <b>cancer</b> screening was timely for several reasons. First, only a few monographs exist that focus exclusively <b>on</b> breast <b>cancer</b> screening, none of which represent a comprehensive treatment of the subject, and all were published before 1990 [1 – 4]. Second, the value of breast cancer screening recently had been challenged by a Cochrane Review [5] on screening for breast cancer with mammography, and a number of independent exper...|$|R

5|$|More {{than half}} of all known cancers involve {{mutations}} of p53, a tumor suppressor protein present in every cell which regulates the cell cycle and signals for cell death in the event of damage to DNA. Specific mutations in p53 can disrupt these functions, allowing an abnormal cell to continue growing unchecked, resulting in the development of tumors. Analysis of these mutations helps explain the root causes of p53-related cancers. In 2004, Folding@home was used to perform the first molecular dynamics study of the refolding of p53's protein dimer in an all-atom simulation of water. The simulation's results agreed with experimental observations and gave insights into the refolding of the dimer that were formerly unobtainable. This was the first peer reviewed publication <b>on</b> <b>cancer</b> from a distributed computing project. The following year, Folding@home powered a new method to identify the amino acids crucial for the stability of a given protein, which was then used to study mutations of p53. The method was reasonably successful in identifying cancer-promoting mutations and determined the effects of specific mutations which could not otherwise be measured experimentally.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic {{chemical}} {{production has}} escalated following the stimulus it received {{during the second}} World War. Chemical production includes everything from herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers to domestic chemicals and hazardous substances. Apart from the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, chemicals of particular concern include: heavy metals, nuclear waste, chlorofluorocarbons, persistent organic pollutants and all harmful chemicals capable of bioaccumulation. Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless {{there needs to be}} rigorous testing of new chemicals, in all countries, for adverse environmental and health effects. International legislation has been established to deal with the global distribution and management of dangerous goods. The effects of some chemical agents needed long-term measurements and a lot of legal battles to realize their danger to human health. The classification of the toxic carcinogenic agents is handle by the International Agency for Research <b>on</b> <b>Cancer.</b>|$|E
5|$|TCDD was {{classified}} in 1997 by the International Agency for Research <b>on</b> <b>Cancer</b> as a carcinogen for humans (group 1). In the occupational cohort studies {{available for the}} classification, the risk, even at very high exposures, was weak and borderline detectable. Therefore, human data were not deemed sufficient, and the classification was, in essence, based on animal experiments and mechanistic considerations. This has been criticized as a deviation from IARC classification rules. It is much debated whether TCDD is carcinogenic only at high doses which also cause toxic damage of tissues. Moreover, a recent review concludes that, after 1997, further studies do not support an association between TCDD exposure and cancer risk. New studies include the update of Vietnam veteran studies from Ranch Hand operation, which concluded that after 30 years the results do not provide evidence of disease.|$|E
