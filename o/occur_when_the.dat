5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal. Rebound symptoms are {{the return of the}} symptoms for which the patient was treated but worse than before. Withdrawal symptoms are the new symptoms that <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of physical dependence.|$|E
50|$|Whereas {{transplant}} rejection <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> host rejects <b>the</b> graft, GvHD <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> graft {{rejects the}} host. The underlying principle (alloimmunity) is the same, but {{the details and}} course may differ.|$|R
50|$|Bernard Weiner {{proposed}} {{a detailed account}} of the attributional approach to learned helplessness. His attribution theory includes the dimensions of globality/specificity, stability/instability, and internality/externality. A global attribution <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> individual believes that the cause of negative events is consistent across different contexts. A specific attribution <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> individual believes that the cause of a negative event is unique to a particular situation. A stable attribution <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> individual believes the cause to be consistent across time. Unstable attribution <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> individual thinks that the cause is specific to one point in time. An external attribution assigns causality to situational or external factors, while an internal attribution assigns causality to factors within the person.|$|R

5|$|From 12 to 14 September 2013, {{details of}} the Framework were {{negotiated}} at the InterContinental Hotel in Geneva, Switzerland. High-level negotiations were held between Kerry and Lavrov, with large teams of experts simultaneously working on technical details. A key breakthrough was reported to <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> U.S. and Russia agreed on their approximations of the Syrian chemical weapon stockpile (estimated at 1,000 tons of sarin, mustard agent and VX nerve agent). On 14 September 2013 the Framework was agreed and signed.|$|E
5|$|In those {{receiving}} heparin {{through an}} intravenous infusion, {{a complex of}} symptoms ("systemic reaction") may <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> infusion is started.

5|$|Some {{types of}} chronic lung {{diseases}} {{are classified as}} restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction {{in the amount of}} lung tissue involved in respiration. These include pulmonary fibrosis which can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> lung is inflamed {{for a long period of}} time. Fibrosis in the lung replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue. This can be due to a large variety of occupational diseases such as Coalworker's pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.|$|E
5|$|The International Planetary Patrol Program {{was formed}} in 1969 as a {{consortium}} to continually monitor planetary changes. This worldwide group focused on observing dust storms on Mars. Their images allow Martian seasonal patterns to be studied globally, and they showed that most Martian dust storms <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> planet is closest to the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The second {{mechanism}} may <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{chest is}} suddenly decelerated, as occurs in vehicle accidents, producing a shearing force. The lungs are mobile {{in the chest}} cavity but their movement is more restricted near the hilum. Areas near the cricoid cartilage and carina are fixed to the thyroid cartilage and the pericardium respectively; thus if the airways move, they can tear at these points of fixation.|$|E
50|$|ATN may be {{classified}} as either toxic or ischemic. Toxic ATN <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> tubular cells are exposed to a toxic substance (nephrotoxic ATN). Ischemic ATN <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> tubular cells do not get enough oxygen, a condition that they are highly sensitive and susceptible to, due to their very high metabolism.|$|R

5|$|Abrahams Creek is {{the main}} source of {{flooding}} in West Wyoming, Forty Fort, and Swoyersville. Sheet flooding can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> creek floods over Eighth Street. There is a flood protection project for the creek in West Wyoming. This protection is capable of withstanding 100 year floods. The Slocum Dam, which is upstream of West Wyoming, also helps to reduce flooding on the creek. However, localized flooding and ponding frequently affect its lower reaches. The creek has been experienced extensive modifications, such as narrowing and riprap installation, in The Hollow to accommodate West Eighth Street.|$|E
5|$|Battles <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> player {{character}} encounters {{an enemy}} while traversing the world. Combat {{takes place in}} real-time, and in the location the player found the enemy rather than a separate battle screen. The main character can equip a variety of weapons, armors, and accessories. Weapons let the player perform abilities in combat. Referred to as Special Techs, these abilities are powerful attacks by the main characters and support characters {{that can be used}} when the special move meter is full. This meter fills as the player damages enemies. Each weapon, such as a sword or spear, has a set number of special attacks to learn, which can hit single or multiple targets and can be assigned to different buttons on the controller.|$|E
5|$|Blackouts in {{freediving}} can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{breath is}} held {{long enough for}} metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue {{towards the end of}} the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.|$|E

50|$|Pleiotropy {{can arise}} from several {{distinct}} but potentially overlapping mechanisms, such as molecular gene pleiotropy, developmental pleiotropy, and selectional pleiotropy. Molecular gene pleiotropy <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> gene product interacts with multiple other proteins or catalyzes multiple reactions. Developmental pleiotropy <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> mutations have multiple {{effects on the}} resulting phenotype. Selectional pleiotropy <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> resulting phenotype has multiple effects on fitness (perhaps depending on age, gender, etc.).|$|R
30|$|New call {{blocking}} <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> {{there are no}} enough resources to carry {{the service of a}} certain type of user in the system. Generally, for PUs, new {{call blocking}} <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> all N resources are being used by PUs. New call blocking for SUs <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> N[*]+[*]R resources are being used, while new call blocking for RUs <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> K resources of the RS sub-network are being occupied either by SUs or RUs.|$|R
5|$|However, {{others argue}} that the Sun is {{currently}} close to the galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Sun passes through the galaxy's spiral arms. Spiral arms are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright blue giants, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as supernovae.|$|E
5|$|Ultra-stripped supernovae <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{exploding}} star has been stripped (almost) {{all the way}} to the metal core, via mass transfer in a close binary. As a result, very little material is ejected from the {{exploding star}} (~0.1 MSun). In the most extreme cases, ultra-stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass limit. SN 2005ek might be an observational example of an ultra-stripped supernova, giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve. The nature of ultra-stripped supernovae can be both iron core-collapse and electron capture supernovae, depending on the mass of the collapsing core.|$|E
5|$|Core-collapse {{is thought}} to <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> more massive stars in a {{globular}} cluster encounter their less massive companions. Over time, dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate {{from the center of}} the cluster to the outside. This results in a net loss of kinetic energy from the core region, leading the remaining stars grouped in the core region to occupy a more compact volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region of the cluster becomes densely crowded with stars and the surface brightness of the cluster forms a power-law cusp. (Note that a core collapse is not the only mechanism that can cause such a luminosity distribution; a massive black hole at the core can also result in a luminosity cusp.) Over a lengthy period of time this leads to a concentration of massive stars near the core, a phenomenon called mass segregation.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, the {{critical}} case (between overdetermined and underdetermined) <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> number of equations {{and the number}} of free variables are equal. For every variable giving a degree of freedom, there exists a corresponding constraint removing a degree of freedom. The underdetermined case, by contrast, <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> system has been underconstrained - that is, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> unknowns outnumber the equations.|$|R
5|$|In between Novel {{sections}} are Escape sections, which <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> player finds {{themselves in}} a room from which they need to find the means of escape. These are presented from a first-person perspective, with the player being able to move between different pre-determined positions in each room. To escape, the player is tasked with finding various items and solving puzzles, reminiscent of escape-the-room games. At some points, the player may need to combine objects {{with each other to}} create the necessary tool to complete a puzzle. The puzzles include various brain teasers, such as baccarat and magic squares. An in-game calculator is provided for math-related problems, and the player can ask characters for hints if they find an Escape room too difficult. All Escape sections are self-contained, with all items required to solve the puzzles being available within that section; items are not carried over between Escape sections. After finishing an Escape section, it becomes available to replay from the game's main menu.|$|E
5|$|Besides gyres, {{there are}} {{temporary}} surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a longshore current is created as water is pushed along {{parallel to the}} coastline. The water swirls up onto the beach {{at right angles to}} the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach, and the more oblique the wave's approach, the stronger the longshore current is. These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits, and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. A rip current can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. These strong currents can have a velocity of , can form at different places at different stages of the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. Temporary upwelling currents <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.|$|E
25|$|False positives {{can also}} <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{injected}} area is touched, causing swelling and itching.|$|E
50|$|Reverse {{slippage}} {{as described}} by Taleb <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> purchase of a large position is done at increasing prices, so that the mark to {{market value of the}} position increases. <b>The</b> danger <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> trader attempts to exit his position. If the trader manages to create a squeeze large enough then this phenomenon can be profitable.|$|R

5000|$|Violation valences are {{determined}} by three factors: (1) The evaluation of the behavior; (2) {{whether or not the}} behavior is more or less favorable than the expectation; and (3) the magnitude of the violation.
