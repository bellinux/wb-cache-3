5|$|In June 1913, the Entwurf ("draft") {{theory was}} the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>theory,</b> less elegant and more {{difficult}} than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} some dispute over {{the extent to which}} Kierkegaard {{influenced}} Bohr's philosophy and science. David Favrholdt argued that Kierkegaard had minimal influence over Bohr's work, taking Bohr's statement about disagreeing with Kierkegaard at face value, while Jan Faye argued that one can disagree with the content <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> while accepting its general premises and structure.|$|E
5|$|A notable recent {{development}} in Philosophy of Psychology is Functional Contextualism or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism {{is a modern}} philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed in behavioral science in general, the field of behavior analysis, and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science). Functional contextualism serves as the basis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> of language known as relational frame theory and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism first delineated by Steven C. Hayes which {{emphasizes the importance of}} predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.|$|E
50|$|Many {{consider}} {{this approach to}} be <b>an</b> elegant way <b>of</b> constructing <b>a</b> <b>theory,</b> others as merely <b>a</b> formal way <b>of</b> expressing <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> (usually, the Lagrangian construction is performed after the theory has been developed).|$|R

5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as one of the goals <b>of</b> <b>A</b> <b>Theory</b> of Justice.|$|E
25|$|There {{may be more}} cutoff {{parameters}} {{than just}} for momentum. For example, one may assume that the volume of space is limited, which would interfere with translation invariance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>theory,</b> or assume {{that the number of}} virtual particles is limited, which would interfere with the assumption that every virtual particle may split into more virtual particles. All such restrictions lead to a set of cutoffs that becomes a part of a definition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>theory.</b>|$|E

40|$|Scientific realists believe both what <b>a</b> {{scientific}} <b>theory</b> {{says about}} observables and unobservables. In contrast, scientific antirealists believe what <b>a</b> scientific <b>theory</b> says about observables, but not about unobservables. I argue that scientific realism {{is a more}} useful doctrine than scientific antirealism in science classrooms. If science teachers are antirealists, they are caught in Moore’s paradox when they help their students grasp the content <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scientific <b>theory,</b> and when they explain a phenomenon in terms <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scientific <b>theory.</b> Teachers ask questions to their students to check whether they have grasped the content <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scientific <b>theory.</b> If the students are antirealists, they are also caught in Moore’s paradox when they respond positively to their teachers’ questions, and when they explain a phenomenon in terms <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scientific <b>theory.</b> Finally, neither teachers nor students can understand phenomena in terms of scientific theories, if they are antirealists. clos...|$|R

The result was his first book, Sociologie de l'Algérie (The Sociology of Algeria, 1958), which became an immediate success in France and was published in America in 1962.
