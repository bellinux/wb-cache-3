40|$|The {{advance payment}} scheme is used when a payment {{larger than the}} billed amount is made. The extra payment is {{effectively}} a <b>cash</b> <b>deposit</b> for credit towards bills in future periods. This study presents a model for determining the optimal <b>cash</b> <b>deposit</b> amount {{when there is a}} fixed per-payment cost; the model balances the tradeoff between the fixed payment cost with the lost interest on the <b>cash</b> <b>deposit.</b> We use a renewal theory approach to obtain the long-term expected total cost per period when the bill amounts in a future period are deterministic, exponentially distributed, normally distributed, or Poisson occurrence based with a constant per occurrence charge. For the first two cases, we obtain explicit expressions for the optimal deposit amount; for the latter two, we give numerical procedures. An example in each case is presented, along with a comparison with the usual pay-each-period strategy. We conclude that the advance payment strategy offers significant cost savings when the per-payment cost is relatively large compared with the lost interest of one period's average bill amount; i. e. when interest rate is low or the average bill amount is small. cost models deposit policy inventory theory application...|$|R
