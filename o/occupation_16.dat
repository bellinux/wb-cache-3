There were also further reforms tightening the conditions for unemployment benefit receipt and reducing its generosity over this period, most notably the replacement of the old regime of unemployment benefits with Jobseekers’ Allowance in 1996. This tightening of second tier unemployment benefits might in part explain why disability recipiency rolls began to rise again in the late 1990 s and early 2000 s.|$|E

Materials and Methods: The process of development was initiated by formation of open-ended questions after thorough review of literature which were then administered to SCI participants, caretakers, and professionals working with SCI. Items were generated based on their responses and initial draft of scale was formulated. This initial draft of the scale containing 77 items was then administered to 56 SCI participants for reduction of items using factor analysis, and a prefinal version of the scale was obtained containing thirty items only. Content validity and face validity was then established. Results: The I-APS is both health professional and self-administered questionnaire including two domains: Activities of daily living and <b>occupation</b> with <b>16</b> items having a content validity of 0. 84.

In total 1, 329 persons were interviewed; 71 % were men, 29 % women and 37 % were under 30 years old. The workers live in households with on average 5 members, including themselves. The majority live with a partner and children (64 % of men and 60 % of women). Up to 16 % of workers followed no formal education, two in ten stopped at elementary education, 39 % followed secondary school, 12 % followed vocational education and 13 % went to university. On average, respondents have worked for 8. 29 years. Rating their satisfaction with life-as-a-whole on a scale from 1 =dissatisfied to 10 =satisfied, the interviewees score a 4 on average. One in four respondents work agriculture, followed by 12 % in public administration. Legal and market consultancy and business activities rank third (9 %) and fourth are education and research. This report focuses on the food chain. By definition all agricultural workers are in the food chain, as well as all transportation and storage workers in the sample. Over half of the workers in manufacturing industry work in food manufacturing as well as almost half {{of the people in the}} wholesale and retail industry. Finally, in accommodation and food service activities, this is slightly over half. Two in ten workers are self-employed, 32 % are employees with a permanent contract, 17 % have fixed-term contracts, whereas 31 % have no contract at all. More than half of the people work in an organization with 10 or fewer employees, one in four work in an organization with 11 - 50 employees, 11 % work in businesses of 51 to 100 employees and 10 % work for businesses employing over a 100 people. Those working in the food chain work predominantly in small firms (58 %), as do women (58 %) and the low educated (73 %). The biggest occupational groups are professionals (9 %), technicians and associate professionals (10 %) and elementary occupations (10 %). Workers in the food chain are more often found among the skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers. In the professional and clerical categories the food chain workers are underrepresented.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the hypothesis that}} children of men whose jobs involve contact with many people (particularly children) are at {{an increased risk of}} leukaemia. METHODS: A population based dataset obtained from routinely collected death certificates involving 14, 168 cancer deaths occurring before the age of 15 years registered in England and Wales between 1959 - 63 and 1970 - 90. Associations were assessed with the proportional cancer mortality ratio (PCMR), with all childhood cancer deaths forming the standard for comparison. The PCMRs were adjusted, by stratification, for age and year of death (in 1 -year bands) and paternal social class (nine categories). Analyses were performed by estimated level of paternal occupational social contact (high, medium, and low) for all leukaemias, leukaemia subtype, age at death, year of death, and individual occupation. RESULTS: Out of 223 <b>occupations,</b> 36 (<b>16</b> %) were identified as having potentially high levels of social contact, and 27 (12 %) as having potentially medium levels of social contact. No associations were found between paternal occupational social contact and death during childhood from leukaemia (high social contact: PCMR 94, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 87 to 102; medium social contact: 101, 95 to 106). No associations were found when the data were analysed by leukaemia subtype, age at death, year of death, or individual occupation.
