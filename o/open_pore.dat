25|$|When {{sedimentation}} continues, {{an older}} rock layer becomes buried deeper as a result. The lithostatic {{pressure in the}} rock increases due to {{the weight of the}} overlying sediment. This causes compaction, a process in which grains mechanically reorganize. Compaction is, for example, an important diagenetic process in clay, which can initially consist of 60% water. During compaction, this interstitial water is pressed out of pore spaces. Compaction can also be the result of dissolution of grains by pressure solution. The dissolved material precipitates again in <b>open</b> <b>pore</b> spaces, which means there is a net flow of material into the pores. However, in some cases, a certain mineral dissolves and does not precipitate again. This process, called leaching, increases pore space in the rock.|$|E
25|$|When {{conditions}} are conducive to stomatal opening (e.g., high light intensity and high humidity), a proton pump drives protons (H+) from the guard cells. This {{means that the}} cells' electrical potential becomes increasingly negative. The negative potential opens potassium voltage-gated channels and so an uptake of potassium ions (K+) occurs. To maintain this internal negative voltage so that entry of potassium ions does not stop, negative ions balance the influx of potassium. In some cases, chloride ions enter, while in other plants the organic ion malate is produced in guard cells. This increase in solute concentration lowers the water potential inside the cell, which results in the diffusion of water into the cell through osmosis. This increases the cell's volume and turgor pressure. Then, because of rings of cellulose microfibrils that prevent {{the width of the}} guard cells from swelling, and thus only allow the extra turgor pressure to elongate the guard cells, whose ends are held firmly in place by surrounding epidermal cells, the two guard cells lengthen by bowing apart from one another, creating an <b>open</b> <b>pore</b> through which gas can move.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we report}} {{measurements}} of CFC- 12 (CCl 2 F 2) in firn air and in air extracted from shallow ice cores from three Antarctic sites. The firn air data {{are consistent with}} the known atmospheric history of CFC- 12. In contrast, some of the ice core samples collected near the firn-ice transition exhibit anomalously high CFC- 12 levels. Together, the ice core and firn air data provide evidence for the presence of modern air entrapped in the shallow ice core samples that likely contained <b>open</b> <b>pores</b> at the time of collection. We propose that this is due to closure of the <b>open</b> <b>pores</b> after drilling, entrapping modern air and resulting in elevated CFC- 12 mixing ratios. Our results reveal that open porosity can exist below the maximum depth at which firn air samples can be collected, particularly at sites with lower accumulation rates. CFC- 12 measurements demonstrate that post-drilling closure of <b>open</b> <b>pores</b> can lead to a change in the composition of bubble air in shallow ice cores through purely physical processes.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{adsorption}} in regular, self-ordered alumina <b>pores</b> <b>open</b> {{at both ends}} or only at one end. The straight, non-connected pores have diameters ranging from 22 to 83 nm, with a relative dispersion below 1 % in the pore size. Adsorption isotherms measured in <b>open</b> <b>pores</b> with a torsional microbalance show pronounced hysteresis loops characterized by nearly vertical and parallel adsorption and desorption branches. Blocking {{one end of the}} pores with glue has a strong influence on adsorption, as expected from classical macroscopic arguments. However, the experimental measurements show an unexpectedly rich phenomenology dependent on the pore size. For large pores (Dp ≥ 67 nm), the isotherms for closed end pores present much narrower hysteresis loops whose adsorption and desorption boundaries envelop the desorption branches of the isotherms for the corresponding <b>open</b> <b>pores</b> of the same size. The loop for small closed end pores (Dp = 22 nm) is slightly wider than that for <b>open</b> <b>pores</b> while the adsorption branches coincide. For large pores, in contrast, the desorption branches of pores with the same Dp overlap regardless of the pore opening. These observations are in agreement with our grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations for a cylindrical pore model with constrictions, suggesting that the alumina pores could be modeled using a constricted pore model whose adsorption isotherm depends on the ratio of the constriction size to the pore size (Dc/Dp) ...|$|R

50|$|It was {{discovered}} by Robeson in the early 1990s that polymers with a high selectivity have a low permeability and opposite is true; materials with a low selectivity have a high permeability. This is best illustrated in a Robeson plot where the selectivity is plotted {{as a function of}} the CO2 permeation. In this plot, the upper bound of selectivity is approximately a linear function of the permeability. It was found that the solubility in polymers is mostly constant but the diffusion coefficients vary significantly and this is where the engineering of the material occurs. Somewhat intuitively, the materials with the highest diffusion coefficients have a more <b>open</b> <b>pore</b> structure, thus losing selectivity. There are two methods that researchers are using to break the Robeson limit, one of these is the use of glassy polymers whose phase transition and changes in mechanical properties make it appear that the material is absorbing molecules and thus surpasses the upper limit. The second method of pushing the boundaries of the Robeson limit is by the facilitated transport method. As previously stated, the solubility of polymers is typically fairly constant but the facilitated transport method uses a chemical reaction to enhance the permeability of one component without changing the selectivity.|$|E
