60|$|Then {{they all}} began {{to pay him}} compliments, each one capping the <b>other's</b> <b>remark.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{antagonist}} {{risked his}} life to save mine," [...] Jimmy declared, with an angry flush, for {{he thought he saw}} where the <b>other's</b> <b>remarks</b> led.|$|R
6000|$|... "One don't {{possess a}} knife for {{a matter of}} {{eight or nine years}} without being able to swear to it," [...] the <b>other</b> <b>remarked</b> dryly.|$|R
500|$|Councillor Ford {{announced}} the new show {{would be released}} on YouTube [...] "before Christmas" [...] 2013. A series of short videos of under 5 minutes in length was launched on YouTube on February 10, 2014. In one segment, Mayor Ford admitted lying about his drug use. Others were lighter in tone and included predictions for the Stanley Cup playoffs and <b>other</b> <b>remarks.</b> In the second video, Ford named 18 councillors he wanted defeated, offering his support to any campaign opposing them. Each weekly [...] "episode" [...] consisted of 3 to 5 short videos of 1 to 5 minutes in length. Comments were disabled; however, the brothers occasionally answered viewer emails in the segments. The National Post described the program as [...] "a bizarro world version of Wayne's World".|$|E
500|$|Sotomayor's {{confirmation}} hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on July 13, 2009, {{during which she}} backed away from her [...] "wise Latina" [...] remark, declaring it [...] "a rhetorical flourish that fell flat" [...] and stating that [...] "I {{do not believe that}} any ethnic, racial or gender group has an advantage in sound judgment." [...] When Republican senators confronted her regarding <b>other</b> <b>remarks</b> from her past speeches, she pointed to her judicial record and said she had never let her own life experiences or opinions influence her decisions. Republican senators said that while her rulings to this point might be largely traditional, they feared her Supreme Court rulings – where there is more latitude with respect to precedent and interpretation – might be more reflective of her speeches. Sotomayor defended her position in Ricci as following applicable precedent. [...] When asked whom she admired, she pointed to Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo. In general, Sotomayor followed the hearings formula of recent past nominees by avoiding stating personal positions, declining to take positions on controversial issues likely to come before the Court, agreeing with senators from both parties, and repeatedly affirming that as a justice she would just apply the law. [...] On July 28, 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Sotomayor's nomination; the 13–6 vote was almost entirely along party lines, with no Democrats opposing her and only one Republican supporting her. On August 6, 2009, Sotomayor was confirmed by the full Senate by a vote of 68–31. [...] The vote was largely along party lines, with no Democrats opposing her and nine Republicans supporting her.|$|E
2500|$|Following Akin's comments, {{additional}} controversies arose around <b>other</b> <b>remarks</b> made {{by various}} Republican politicians. The most notable {{of these was}} by Indiana State Treasurer and US Senate nominee Richard Mourdock, who said that life was [...] "something that God intended", even if the pregnancy was due to rape. Some analysts identified the controversies around Mourdock's and Akin's comments, {{and those of other}} candidates, as a principal factor in their election losses. The comments may have had an effect on the national election results; many women voters supported Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{thought if}} you were going to haul up Cayman for scraping, you'd like to know our tug is off the slip," [...] the <b>other</b> <b>remarked.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{might have}} been no {{laughing}} matter for us," [...] the <b>other</b> <b>remarked</b> petulantly. [...] "I have lost a good sea-kit and nearly my life into the bargain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Inspector of Field Hospitals or something, isn't he?" [...] the <b>other</b> <b>remarked</b> carelessly. [...] "I {{came across}} him once at Boulogne. Rather a dull sort of fellow he seemed." ...|$|R
2500|$|The new format was {{met with}} mixed reception; {{musician}} Jann Arden made numerous remarks attacking CKMP on Twitter (despite her music not being played by the station {{because it does not}} fit its format), contending that the edited songs were unethical and disrespectful to the artists work. She called for a boycott of CKMP due to the changes, and among <b>other</b> <b>remarks,</b> jokingly announced that the NHL had shortened its games to be only one period long, and asked her followers to recommend her [...] "half a good book" [...] to read. In response to the boycott, Newcap pulled Jann Arden's music from all of its stations. Jones stated that the response to the format was [...] "generally quite favourable", with many listeners praising the increased amount of music, but noted that Arden was the only artist to have complained about it yet.|$|E
2500|$|Much {{has been}} made over the years of Gilbert Jessop's innings of 157 {{in an hour and}} the {{reactions}} of the coloured cricketers. C.L.R. James reports that Float Woods [...] "went to his captain and asked permission to take off his boots. West Indian captain Aucher Warner asked him why: he replied that he could bowl properly only when barefooted. Woods was making the best response he knew to a truly desperate situation." [...] Sammy Woods in his autobiography reports that Jessop [...] "hit the two famous Black Bowlers (Cumberbatch and Woods) so furiously that not only they couldn't bowl for laughter, {{but the rest of the}} dark ones in the field rolled about and set up a howl of delight". Archie Cumberbatch was, of course, not on the tour at all and this and <b>other</b> <b>remarks</b> are probably embellished. Overall the reports are of doubtful accuracy and have racist undertones to them.|$|E
2500|$|Hannity hosted {{his first}} talk radio show in 1989 at the {{volunteer}} college station at UC Santa Barbara, KCSB-FM, {{while working as}} a general contractor. The show aired for 40 hours of air time. Regarding his first show, he said, [...] "I wasn't good at it. I was terrible." [...] Hannity's weekly show on KCSB was canceled after less than a year. This was after two shows featuring the book The AIDS Coverup: The Real and Alarming Facts about AIDS by Gene Antonio; among <b>other</b> <b>remarks</b> made during the broadcast, Hannity told a lesbian caller, [...] "I feel sorry for your child." [...] The university board that governed the station later reversed its decision due to a campaign conducted on Hannity's behalf [...] by the Santa Barbara chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued that the station had discriminated against Hannity's First Amendment rights. When the station refused to give him a public apology and more airtime, Hannity decided against returning to KCSB.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who can tell?" [...] the <b>other</b> <b>remarked</b> despondently. [...] "The {{pages of}} history are {{littered}} with {{the bodies of}} strong men who have opened their lips to the poisoned spoon." ...|$|R
60|$|She shrugged her {{shoulders}} and made no <b>other</b> <b>remark</b> until they drew {{up in front of}} the house in Russell Square. When he would have assisted her to alight, she hesitated once more.|$|R
60|$|The tension relieved, some of {{the crowd}} laughed, others looked over the {{embankment}} to see how Case had fared, and <b>others</b> <b>remarked</b> that {{for some reason he}} had gotten off better than they expected.|$|R
2500|$|In 1926, the British {{physicist}} Ralph H. Fowler {{observed that}} the relationship between the density, energy, and temperature of white dwarfs could be explained by viewing them as a gas of nonrelativistic, non-interacting electrons and nuclei that obey Fermi–Dirac statistics. [...] This Fermi gas model was then used by the British physicist Edmund Clifton Stoner in 1929 to calculate the relationship among the mass, radius, and density of white dwarfs, assuming they were homogeneous spheres. Wilhelm Anderson applied a relativistic correction to this model, giving rise to a maximum possible mass of approximately 1.37 kg. In 1930, Stoner derived the internal energydensity equation of state for a Fermi gas, and was then able to treat the mass–radius relationship in a fully relativistic manner, giving a limiting mass of approximately (for μe=2.5) 2.19 · 1030 kg. [...] Stoner went on to derive the pressuredensity equation of state, which he published in 1932. [...] These equations of state were also previously published by the Soviet physicist Yakov Frenkel in 1928, together with some <b>other</b> <b>remarks</b> on the physics of degenerate matter. [...] Frenkel's work, however, was ignored by the astronomical and astrophysical community.|$|E
2500|$|J. Bryan Lowder of Slate {{stated that}} Savage [...] "often takes heat for his less-than-refined {{statements}} {{on issues like}} the existence of male bisexuality, the responsibility of asexuals to 'come out' before dating, and, indeed, certain issues surrounding transgenderism." [...] Savage has repeatedly {{been the focus of}} controversy for his use of slurs regarding the transgender community, <b>other</b> <b>remarks</b> regarding trans issues, and for joking that the then Attorney General of Washington was trans (who was not, in fact, trans). He has been glitter bombed three times, twice in 2011 and once in 2012, by protesters who alleged that he is transphobic, among other accusations. In June 2014, during a seminar at the University of Chicago on social media, Savage discussed his past use of the word [...] "tranny". He objected to a student's request that he use the phrase [...] "T-slur" [...] instead, and gave examples of other slurs. Some students criticized him, claiming that he tried to make the student feel threatened and uncomfortable. A University representative said, [...] "A guest used language that provoked a spirited debate. The speaker was discussing how hurtful words can be repurposed and used to empower; at no point did he direct any slurs at anyone." [...] Savage later thanked the University for standing up for him and demanded an apology from those who had accused him of hatred towards trans people.|$|E
60|$|Virginia, who {{had heard}} <b>other</b> <b>remarks</b> of the same nature, looked puzzled.|$|E
60|$|But George said no, he couldn't go. He {{must stop}} {{at home and}} take Pen's place. The <b>other</b> <b>remarked</b> that that was needless, for Shandon was now come back to London, and Arthur was {{entitled}} to a holiday.|$|R
5000|$|Voyeur is a synthpop album which Carnes {{described}} as [...] "more consistent" [...] than its predecessor. It received mixed reviews, with some critics {{in favour of}} the album while <b>others</b> <b>remarked</b> that it {{failed to live up}} to the standard of Mistaken Identity.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should {{recommend}} you to count them {{the next time}} you have one for dinner," [...] the <b>other</b> <b>remarked.</b> As this was evidently meant for a joke, Tom had the tact to laugh, and a very gruesome and awe-inspiring laugh it was too.|$|R
60|$|The Satyr and the Ape-man stood {{watching}} us and making <b>other</b> <b>remarks</b> to each other.|$|E
6000|$|... "Handy!... Air you chased?... What's wrong?... You shore look pale {{round the}} gills." [...] These and <b>other</b> <b>remarks</b> were flung out the door.|$|E
60|$|Before I shut up this {{discourse}} about neutral agency, (which I conceive {{is not to}} be found, or, if found, ought not to be used,) I have a few <b>other</b> <b>remarks</b> to make on the cause which I conceive gives rise to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "That so?" [...] the <b>other</b> <b>remarked.</b> [...] "Well, you'll get him, sure! He's {{looking pretty}} scared, too. You'd better {{keep your eyes}} open, though. I don't know how many men there are on board, but that tug belongs to the toughest crew up the river. Got {{anything}} handy {{in the way of}} firearms?" ...|$|R
60|$|With these words, uttered {{with great}} {{emphasis}} and emotion, brother Charles {{put on his}} broad-brimmed hat, and, passing Ralph Nickleby without any <b>other</b> <b>remark,</b> trotted nimbly into the street. Ralph looked after him, but neither moved nor spoke for some time: when he broke what almost seemed the silence of stupefaction, by a scornful laugh.|$|R
50|$|<b>Others</b> have <b>remarked</b> that 'script analysis...is overly psychoanalytic in {{attitude}} and overly reductionist'.|$|R
60|$|These and <b>other</b> <b>remarks</b> were made, as {{the boys}} on the highway gazed down at the craft that was {{speeding}} along in such an erratic fashion {{over the surface of}} the river. A closer look confirmed their first opinion, that nobody was on board.|$|E
60|$|These {{and a dozen}} <b>other</b> <b>remarks</b> Fred {{heard as}} he left the breaker, and while {{loitering}} for an instant to learn if any one suspected the true state of affairs he became conscious that Skip and his friends were regarding him with mingled anger and consternation written on their faces.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where's Red? Where's the bug? Where's the nut? Delaney, did you {{lock the}} gates? Look under the bench!" [...] These and <b>other</b> <b>remarks,</b> not exactly elegant, attested {{to the mental}} {{processes}} {{of some of the}} Stars. Red Gilbat {{did not appear to be}} forthcoming. There was an anxious delay Capt. Healy searched for the missing player. Delaney did not say any more.|$|E
5000|$|The {{main feature}} {{highlighted}} in reviews {{is the fact}} that the Webydo code generator manages to replace the developer in the web design process, an achievement described as a [...] "web design revolution". <b>Other</b> <b>remarked</b> features are the rich, intuitive and easy-to-use web design software, providing ample room to manage the professional web design process and the good hosting infrastructure.|$|R
60|$|And {{then another}} {{suggests}} that {{with such a}} voice {{he ought to have}} been a sea-captain. Some draw attention to the desperate way in which he is grasping his hat. Some comment upon his limited powers of conversation. <b>Others</b> <b>remark</b> upon the troublesome nature of his cough. And so on, until his peculiarities and the company are both thoroughly exhausted.|$|R
6000|$|Daggett reflected; {{and it is}} {{probable}} that, as he cooled off from the excitement created by his late exertions, he fully recognised the justice of the <b>other's</b> <b>remarks,</b> and the injustice of his own claims. Still, {{it seemed to him}} un-American, un-Vineyard, if the reader please, to [...] "give up;" [...] and he clung to his error with as much pertinacity {{as if he had been}} right.|$|R
