Akhmatova's Requiem in Russian finally appeared in book form in Munich in 1963, the whole work not published within USSR until 1987.

Preliminary examination by a forensic {{expert on the}} island determined that the bone was from a young woman. A part of the bone was sent to The Hague for testing by the Netherlands Forensic Institute. On November 23, 2010, Aruba Solicitor-General Taco Stein announced that—based on dental records—the jawbone was not from Holloway, {{and it was not}} possible to determine whether it had come from a man <b>or</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|E
5|$|Raonic is {{the most}} {{successful}} Canadian singles player in history. He became the highest-ranked Canadian male ever on February 21, 2011, when he reached world No. 37. His career-high world No. 3 ranking is the highest by a Canadian man <b>or</b> <b>woman.</b> He is the first Canadian male in the Open Era to reach the Australian Open semifinals, the French Open quarterfinals, and the Wimbledon final. He has more ATP World Tour titles and finals appearances in the Open Era than all other Canadian men combined.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 French Open Men's singles final was the {{championship}} tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2012 French Open. It pitted the world's top two players, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, {{against each other}} in a Grand Slam tournament final for the fifth time overall and fourth consecutive time. This match had historical proportions as Djokovic would have become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win all four Majors simultaneously, whereas Nadal was looking to break Björn Borg's record of six French Open titles and equal Chris Evert's record of seven French Open titles held by a man <b>or</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although {{he focuses}} on the French Revolution, the story ends in the 1880s, shortly after the Second French Empire, closely {{following}} the evolution of society and women (see also Historiography of the French Revolution). Later, he republished what was essentially is the same book but with a different title, in both French and English: La Femme et la mode. Métamorphoses de la parisienne de 1792 à 1892 <b>or</b> <b>Woman</b> and Fashion: Metamorphoses of the Parisienne 1792–1892 in the English version (1892), and Les Modes de Paris. Variations du goût et de l'esthétique de la femme, 1797–1897 (1897). According to the Westminster Review, the English edition was practically a facsimile of the French, and the translator literally wrote the sentences {{to the point of}} unintelligibility.|$|E
5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} <b>or</b> <b>woman</b> is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E
5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{investigate}} the fatal shooting of a man, who was apparently killed for a $1.49 pen. Lewis believes {{there must be}} more to the story, refusing to believe a pen is worth killing for. When they search suspect Mitchell Forman's (Sal S. Koussa) apartment, they find thousands of pens, many of which line the walls like bizarre decorations. Lewis later finds Forman at the police station, where he originally planned to turn himself in, but instead {{went up to the}} roof to commit suicide. Lewis lures Forman away from the ledge by enticing him with a beautiful golden pen, which belonged to Lewis' deceased grandmother. Forman is taken into custody. Later, Lewis still cannot believe someone would kill over a pen, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) suggests it is no worse than killing over a car <b>or</b> <b>woman.</b> Lewis, determined not to develop such a strong attachment to a material item, gives his grandmother's pen to Felton (Daniel Baldwin).|$|E

5|$|These fashions {{permeated}} noble households, where resident musicians were employed, including viol and lute players. As {{elsewhere in}} Europe, musical ability {{became one of}} the major achievements expected of a nobleman <b>or</b> <b>woman.</b> Musicians were clearly employed as teachers for the children of the household, both male and female. There is evidence for the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries of lessons being given in a variety of instruments and singing, and of the purchase of sheet music and instruments (including the virginals and harpsichords). In the Highlands clan chiefs continued to employ harpists, and increasingly, pipers as fili and bards, whose prowess and ability to glorify their ancestors was a key element in underlying a clan's status and heritage into the seventeenth century. The earliest printed collection of secular music in Scotland was by publisher John Forbes in Aberdeen in 1662. Songs and Fancies: to Thre, Foure, or Five Partes, both Apt for Voices and Viols, known as Forbes' Cantus, was printed three times in the next twenty years. It contained 77 songs, of which 25 were of Scottish origin.|$|E

25|$|Screenwriters and {{directors}} use {{the image of}} a man <b>or</b> <b>woman</b> slipping on a pair of leather gloves to indicate knowledge that a crime is happening. It is a common cliche in film for the hero to hold on to a person's gloved hand, and for the person to slip out of the glove and fall to their death. This can be seen in Batman and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.|$|E
25|$|Femme au Chapeau <b>or</b> <b>Woman</b> with a Hat is an oil {{painting}} created circa 1906 by the French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger (1883–1956). The work is executed {{in a highly}} personal Divisionist style with a marked Proto-Cubist component {{during the height of}} Fauvism. Femme au Chapeau exhibits a presentiment of Metzinger's subsequent interest in the faceting of form associated with Cubism. The painting now forms part of the collection of the Korban Art Foundation.|$|E

25|$|The Defense of Marriage Act did {{not provide}} a legal {{definition}} of man <b>or</b> <b>woman.</b> Until 2002, USCIS tended to recognize marriages that included a transgender partner if those marriages were considered valid in the jurisdiction where the marriage was established. Beginning in 2002, USCIS rejected all applications of couples in which one partner was transgender, which became formal policy in 2004. Later that year, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) rejected the policy in a non-precedential decision.|$|E
