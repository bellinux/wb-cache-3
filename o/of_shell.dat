5|$|After death, {{the empty}} shell of this sea snail {{is often used}} by hermit crabs. On {{the coast of the}} Caraguatatuba, Brazil, a study <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> use in the diogenid hermit crab species Isocheles sawayai was carried out. This study {{revealed}} that 11.5% of the population of these hermit crabs were using shells of Semicassis granulata. The occupation <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> type was reported as not being random, but was instead described as being influenced by the weight, size, shape and internal volume of the shell, the occurrence of epibionts such as bryozoans on the shell, and the degree of resistance the shell offered to predation and desiccation.|$|E
5|$|For {{adventitious}} protection, {{an animal}} uses {{materials such as}} twigs, sand, or pieces <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> to conceal its outline, for example when a caddis fly larva builds a decorated case, or when a decorator crab decorates its back with seaweed, sponges and stones.|$|E

5|$|The {{shells of}} Amphidromus are {{relatively}} large, {{from one to}} three inches high, and colorful. Amphidromus has an elongate-conic or ovate-conic helicoid shell of 5 to 8 whorls. The shell may be thin and fragile, or very heavy and solid, with no known correlation <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> structure with distribution or habitats.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer <b>of</b> <b>shell,</b> called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E
5|$|Foskett {{was born}} in the Sydney suburb of Roseville, New South Wales, on 7 May 1917 to Edward George Foskett, an accountant, and his wife Dora Mabel (n√©e Cotterill). Foskett was educated at Hornsby Junior Technical School, before going on to study accountancy. He later gained {{employment}} as a clerk in the credit department <b>of</b> <b>Shell</b> Co. of Australia Pty Ltd. In his youth, Foskett was active in scouting as a Rover as well as sport, particularly hockey; {{he was a member of}} the Gordon district hockey club and represented New South Wales.|$|E

5|$|Official {{interest}} in Hurst Castle increased {{again in the}} 1840s, as the introduction <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> guns and steam ships created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast. Previously, sailing ships had been only able to pass the castle slowly when moving against the tide, making them vulnerable to its guns; steam ships threatened to cruise past at speed. Military estimates and surveys in 1850 and 1851 suggested that the armament should therefore be significantly increased, to include more and much heavier guns.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than try}} to fit more guns onto a ship, it was {{possible}} to increase the power of each gun. This could be done by increasing either the calibre of the weapon and hence the weight <b>of</b> <b>shell,</b> or by lengthening the barrel to increase muzzle velocity. Either of these offered the chance to increase range and armour penetration.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{had contact}} with these societies, and {{established}} missions further north, near Lake Okeechobee. In the 18th century, invading Creeks incorporated the dwindling numbers of the Tequesta into their own. Neither the Tequesta nor Calusa tribe existed by 1800. Disease, warfare, and capture for slavery were {{the reasons for the}} eradication of both groups. The only evidence of their existence within the park boundaries is a series <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> mounds that were built by the Calusa.|$|E

5|$|The {{terrain of}} South Florida is {{relatively}} and consistently flat. The limestone that underlies the Everglades {{is integral to}} the diverse ecosystems within the park. Florida was once part of the African portion of the supercontinent Gondwana. After it separated, conditions allowed a shallow marine environment to deposit calcium carbonate in sand, shells, and coral to be converted into limestone. Tiny bits <b>of</b> <b>shell,</b> sand, and bryozoans compressed over multiple layers forming structures in the limestone called ooids, which created permeable conditions that hold water.|$|E
5|$|Wilson Popenoe and {{his wife}} in 1931, at a site in Honduras dating back to 600 AD, found the lower {{mandible}} of a young Mayan woman, with three missing incisors replaced by pieces <b>of</b> <b>shell,</b> shaped to resemble teeth. Bone growth around two of the implants, {{and the formation of}} calculus, indicates that they were functional as well as esthetic. The fragment is currently part of the Osteological Collection of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University.|$|E
5|$|Another {{improvement}} {{from the}} 12th century onwards {{was the creation}} <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> keeps, involving replacing the wooden keep on the motte with a circular stone wall. Buildings could be built around {{the inside of the}} shell, producing a small inner courtyard. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development with a perfectly circular wall and a square entrance tower while the later Launceston Castle, although more ovoid than circular, is another good example of the design and one of the most formidable castles of the period. Round castles were unusually popular throughout Cornwall and Devon. Although the circular design held military advantages, these only really mattered in the 13th century onwards; the origins of 12th-century circular design were the circular design of the mottes; indeed, some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that at Windsor Castle.|$|E

5|$|Burial PNT-002 was interred with Burial PNT-003 in {{the third}} stepped {{platform}} of the second version of the Lost World Pyramid (5C-54) prior to the fourth platform being completed. The deceased was an adult male aged between 36 and 55 years old; he was found lying extended on his back with a southeast-northwest orientation. Most of the bones were preserved to a certain degree; although the skull was badly fragmented {{it was evident that}} artificial craneal deformation had taken place. One of the upper canine teeth was fitted with pyrite decoration; the other canine had a crescent-shaped hollow that had once held its decoration. The deceased had several items <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> jewellery.|$|E
5|$|Civilian {{telephones}} {{were used}} {{at the outset of}} the war, but they were found to be unreliable in the damp, muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, the field telephone was designed; a device that operated with its own switchboard. Apart from voice communication, it featured a buzzer unit with a Morse code key, so that it could be used to send and receive coded messages. This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out voice communication. The telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> fire and the movement of troops. The lines were generally buried, with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages.|$|E
5|$|From {{the mid-19th}} century onwards, changes in {{military}} technology repeatedly challenged the value and composition of Britain's coastal defences. The introduction <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> guns and steam ships created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast, and fears grew of a conflict in the early 1850s. Southsea Castle and St Mawes were extended with new gun batteries, Pendennis was reequipped with heavier guns and Hurst was extensively redeveloped. There were discussions about rearming Calshot, but these were rejected, {{in part due to}} concerns about the suitability of the 16th-century walls in modern warfare. The Crimean War sparked a fresh invasion scare and in 1855 the south coast of England was refortified. New guns were installed at St Catherine's and Yarmouth in 1855. The remains of the West Blockhouse were destroyed by a new fortification, the West Blockhouse Fort, designed to deal with the French threat.|$|E

5|$|Molecular {{analyses}} of partial sequences of 16S rDNA of 18 distinct species {{carried out by}} Sutcharit and colleagues (2007) indicate that Amphidromus is a monophyletic group. In their study, different cladograms obtained through distinct methods such as maximum parsimony, neighbor joining and maximum likelihood were congruent among themselves. Though the topology obtained for the subgenus Amphidromus was fairly consistent with current taxonomy, the phylogeny of sinistral Syndromus species showed no such correspondence. Also according to their results, enantiomorphy {{seems to be the}} ancestral state <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> coiling in the genus Amphidromus, which is contrary to the general expectation of dextrally coiled shells as an ancestral condition.|$|E
5|$|On {{volunteering}} {{for service}} in the war, Hargest sought to serve abroad in command {{of one of the}} infantry brigades of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF). However, the newly appointed commander of the 2NZEF, Major General Bernard Freyberg was concerned about the age and command experience of some potential senior officers of the 2NZEF such as Hargest. A subsequent medical assessment deemed Hargest fit only for service on the Home Front as he was still prone to bouts <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> shock from his service during the First World War. Disappointed with this decision, he approached Peter Fraser, the acting Prime Minister of New Zealand, with a request for a brigade command in 2NZEF. Fraser disregarded official advice and arranged for Hargest to be appointed commander of the 5th Infantry Brigade. At the time, the Chief of the General Staff of the New Zealand Military Forces, Major-General John Duigan, wrote to Freyberg, disassociating himself from the decision.|$|E
5|$|Rocks {{and land}} {{at the foot of}} these {{mountains}} is calcarenite, a coral sand, blown inland during the Pleistocene between 130,000 and 20,000 years ago and cemented into stratified layers by water percolation. In this rock are fossils of bird bones and eggs, land and marine snails and the extinct endemic horned turtle (Meiolania platyceps) now thought to be an ancient relictual non-swimming tortoise with relatives in South America. The crescent of the island protects a coral reef and lagoon, the barrier reef, at 31¬∞ S, is the most southerly in the world. Beach sands, rather than consisting of quartz grains derived from granite, as on the mainland, are made of fragments <b>of</b> <b>shell,</b> coral and coralline algae, together with basalt grains, and basaltic minerals like black diopside, and green olivine. The lowland consists of alluvial soils.|$|E
