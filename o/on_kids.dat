25|$|The First Season of Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters, {{based on}} the manga by Kazuki Takahashi, premiered in Japan on April 18, 2000, and {{concluded}} on April 3, 2001, on TV Tokyo. An English adaptation of the series was made and premiered in the United States on September 29, 2001, and concluded on November 9, 2002, <b>on</b> <b>Kids</b> WB. It was renamed Yu-Gi-Oh! {{due to the fact}} that the first Yu-Gi-Oh! TV series was never released outside Japan.

The original version features vocals from Shunsuke Kazama, Hiroki Takahashi, Hidehiro Kikuchi, Maki Saito and Kenjiro Tsuda as the main characters.

500|$|According to Richard Guilliatt and Jacquelin Magnay in {{an article}} in The Australian, Harris' {{campaign}} against paedophilia in Kids Can Say No! can [...] "be seen in retrospect as either monumental self-delusion or a sign of deep, self-lacerating guilt". NSPCC chief executive officer Peter Wanless appeared on Good Morning Britain saying that Harris' appearance in the film was hypocritical. In an Irish Daily Mail article, Paul Bracchi writes that Harris' work <b>on</b> <b>Kids</b> Can Say No! {{at the same time that}} he was abusing girls was [...] "one of the most sickening examples [...] hiding in plain sight". In 2014, theme composer Peter Alsop said that Harris may have used the film to groom children because it encouraged trust by parents.|$|E
500|$|Cardcaptors first {{aired in}} the United States on Kids' WB between June 17, 2000 and December 14, 2001. The version that aired <b>on</b> <b>Kids</b> WB was an {{alternate}} {{version of the}} Nelvana dub that was heavily edited even further with episodes re-ordered and some left out completely. The editing to the original Nelvana dub was done to refocus the series to be more action oriented for the appeal of male viewers, as they were seen as the largest audience of animation at the time. The first episode aired in Kids' WB's version was [...] "Sakura's Rival", the eighth episode of the series, having removed episodes focusing on Sakura {{and to have the}} show start with Syaoran's arrival. The series ran for 39 episodes, changing the original episode order but finishing with the show's actual final episode.|$|E

500|$|Seili has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Most of the reviewers have been {{appreciative of the}} vocals and the successful combination of synthpop and darker ballads, but more or less critical with the notable contrast between the thumping pop song [...] "Nettiin" [...] {{and the rest of}} the album and Vartiainen's lack of peculiarity. Teemu Fiilin of the magazine Rumba gave Seili three out of five stars, saying that [...] "Seili follows pretty much the schlager-ish pattern of a poet girl's inflated electro-pop". He complimented [...] "En haluu kuolla tänä yönä" [...] as [...] "a brilliant pop song, suitable to be sung by a [...] 27-year-old Jenni Vartiainen who is enjoying her life". Due to the accompaniment of the more poetical, dramatical and mature songs written by Mariska, Fiilin considered [...] "Nettiin" [...] "a really epic fail" [...] that [...] "would be a lot of fun if performed by Tea Hiilloste <b>on</b> <b>Kids</b> Top 20". He thought [...] "Duran Duran" [...] is also brilliant, but considered Vartiainen to be more talented with faster songs, because she, when singing melancholic songs, [...] "lags kilometers behind [...] Chisu". The pop rock magazine Stara said the album is not as good at first hearing as Vartiainen's debut Ihmisten edessä, but it gave the album four out five stars. The magazine complimented the aggregate of [...] "En haluu kuolla tänä yönä" [...] and the beauty and elegance of [...] "Duran Duran". Stara was less harsh on reviewing the inclusion of [...] "Nettiin", saying the Western-themed sounds seem a bit odd, but that the song is good in its entirety.|$|E
2500|$|According to Suetonius, Nero moved against Britannicus, {{employing}} the same poisoner, Locusta, {{who had been}} hired to murder his father, Claudius. The first dose failed, and Nero decided to throw caution to the wind. In the account of Suetonius, he had Locusta brought to his room to mix a faster acting poison before his very eyes. After many tests <b>on</b> <b>kids,</b> there was a mixture that killed an animal instantly. Being pleased, Nero had the concoction brought immediately to the dining room.|$|E
2500|$|In the U.S. city of Seattle, Washington, the city's Major League Baseball franchise, the Seattle Mariners, {{initially}} sued in King County Superior Court to try {{to prevent}} Dreamgirls cabaret from opening. [...] The team's attorneys argued that the strip club's existence would adversely affect families that visit the stadium. [...] The suit was dropped after the Mariners reached a compromise which included limits on outdoor advertising, window displays, and signs. [...] The compromise specified that the clubs video screens would only show text <b>on</b> <b>kids</b> days at the stadium, and not images of strippers. [...] In May 2010, there was public controversy because the club showed strippers on its large electronic display on [...] "kids' day". [...] Dreamgirls claimed that it is the team's responsibility to tell them when such a display is prohibited.|$|E
