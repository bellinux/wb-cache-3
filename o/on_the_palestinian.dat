He left for Syria afterward and briefly aided in the unity talks between Syria and Egypt in the mid-1950s.

40|$|What {{triggered}} the new war in Lebanon was Israel's offensive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> in Gaza. Since Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, the Hezbollah carefully refrained from confrontations with the Israeli army inside the Israeli border (restricting themselves to confrontations in the Shaba area of Lebanon, which Israel still occupies). The timing {{of its first}} attack, {{as well as its}} rhetoric afterwards, indicate that their intention was to reduce <b>the</b> pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> by opening a new front. Their attack can be viewed, then, as the first military act of solidarity with <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> in <b>the</b> Arab world. Whatever one may think about Hezbollah's act, {{it is important to understand}} the nature of Israel's war against <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> in Gaza...|$|R

25|$|The Arab revolt in Mandatory Palestine was unsuccessful, and its {{consequences}} affected {{the outcome of the}} 1948 Palestine war. It caused the British Mandate to give crucial support to pre-state Zionist militias like the Haganah, whereas <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Arab side, the revolt forced the flight into exile of the main Palestinian Arab leader of the period, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem – Haj Amin al-Husseini.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} October 1917, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) {{began their}} third assault to capture the port of Gaza <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Mediterranean coast. Their first {{objective}} was to capture Beersheba on the British right flank, then move west rolling up the GazaBeersheba defence line. At the same time leaving some of their mounted forces, positioned {{on the right to}} pursue, northwards, the withdrawing Turkish forces.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of {{negotiations}} and threats following the invasion, Saddam focused renewed attention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> problem by promising to withdraw his forces from Kuwait if Israel would relinquish the occupied territories in the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and the Gaza Strip. Saddam's proposal further split the Arab world, pitting U.S.- and Western-supported Arab states against the Palestinians. The allies ultimately rejected any linkage between the Kuwait crisis and Palestinian issues.|$|E

5000|$|Angered, the Jordanian Army called loudly for a {{crackdown}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> But as a biographer of the King, Peter Snow, wrote in 1972, [...] "Talhouni wavered; like Hussein, {{he was not}} eager {{to be responsible for}} the order that could lead to wide-scale bloodshed." ...|$|R
25|$|Tensions between Fatah and Hamas {{intensified}} after Hamas won {{the elections}} of 2006 {{and the international community}} increased the pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Authority. As a result of the Hamas led government's refusal to commit to nonviolence, recognition of the state of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements, Israel, the Middle East Quartet (United States, Russia, United Nations, and European Union), several Western states, and the Arab states imposed sanctions suspending all foreign aid.|$|E
25|$|On 18 June 2007, the European Union {{promised to}} resume direct {{aid to the}} Palestinian Authority, and Abbas {{dissolved}} the National Security Council, a sticking point in the defunct unity government with Hamas. That same day, the United States decided to end its fifteen-month embargo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Authority and resume aid, attempting to strengthen Abbas's West Bank government. A day later, the Fatah Central Committee cut off all ties and dialogue with Hamas, pending the return of Gaza.|$|E
25|$|From the Israeli perspective, a key {{concern is}} security, {{and whether the}} major Palestinian figures and {{institutions}} are in fact trying to fight terrorism and promote tolerance and co-existence with Israel. Israeli concerns are based on abundant documentary and empirical evidence of many Palestinian leaders having in fact promoted and supported terrorist groups and activities. Furthermore, there is much concrete evidence of Palestinians having supported and expressed incitment against Israel, its motives, actions, and basic rights as a state. The election of Hamas has provided evidence for this view, with the Hamas charter stating unequivocally {{that it does not}} recognize Israel's right to exist. However, there remain some activists <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> side who claim that there are still some positive signs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> side, and that Israel should use these to cultivate some positive interactions with the Palestinians, even in spite of Hamas's basic opposition to the existence of the Jewish State. Since mid-June 2007, Israel has cooperated with Palestinian security forces in the West Bank at unprecedented levels, thanks in part to United States-sponsored training, equipping, and funding of the Palestinian National Security Forces and Presidential Guard.|$|E
50|$|The {{proposed}} resolution {{will not}} directly impact <b>the</b> situation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. <b>The</b> <b>Palestinian</b> leadership has conceded that negotiations with Israel will {{be essential to}} ending the dispute.|$|R
50|$|Looking back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> entire incident, I {{now find}} it {{fascinating}} and somehow uplifting {{that the public}} broadcasting network in Israel agreed to finance and broadcast a film that investigated the horrors inflicted by Israeli forces <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> I wonder how many other countries would have agreed to do that.|$|R
50|$|In February 1970, King Hussein of Jordan {{met with}} their leaders at Talhouni's house in Amman. At that meeting the King {{agreed not to}} enforce {{restrictions}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> carrying firearms in Jordanian towns, {{and the leaders of}} the guerrillas promised to try to make their followers less unruly.|$|R
25|$|The Franco-British {{boundary}} agreement of 1920 described an imprecisely defined boundary between Lebanon and Palestine. It appeared to pass {{close to the}} north of al-Bassa, leaving the village <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> side but cut off from much of its lands. However the French government included al-Bassa in a Lebanese census of 1921 and granted citizenship to its residents. Meanwhile, a joint British-French boundary commission was working to determine a precise border, making many adjustments in the process. By February 1922 it had determined a border that confirmed al-Bassa as being in Palestine. This became official in 1923. The citizenship of the residents was changed to Palestinian in 1926.|$|E
25|$|Eleven Palestinian {{human rights}} organizations, {{including}} two based in Israel, called <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Authority and the Hamas government in Gaza to investigate Palestinian violations {{of international law}} allegedly committed during the Gaza War. Alleged violations include Palestinian attacks on civilians in Israel and instances of internal repression, such as summary executions in the Gaza Strip and arrests and torture in the West Bank. The letter asked to launch investigations before the 5 February deadline. The authors of the call said that for PLO efforts to have the report endorsed by the UN to be of lasting value, the Palestinian authorities must take action to implement its recommendations.|$|E
25|$|A further {{concern is}} whether, {{as a result}} of this {{security}} argument, Israel will in fact allow the Palestinian community to emerge as a viable and sovereign political unit, a viable and contiguous state. There are also various economic and political restrictions placed on Palestinian people, activities, and institutions which have had a detrimental effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> economy and quality of life. Israel has said repeatedly that these restrictions are necessary due to security concerns, and in order to counteract ongoing efforts which promote terrorism which incite opposition to Israel's existence and rights as a country. The key obstacle therefore remains the Israeli demand for security versus Palestinian claims for rights and statehood.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton voiced {{support for}} the {{establishment}} of a Palestinian state—a solution not endorsed by prime minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom she had earlier pledged the United States' cooperation. Upon the arrival of President Obama administration's special envoy, George Mitchell, Netanyahu said that any furtherance of negotiations with <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> would be conditioned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> recognizing Israel as a Jewish state.|$|R
25|$|As a result, {{two days}} later, an Israeli {{commando}} flew into Beirut's international airport and destroyed {{more than a}} dozen civilian airliners belonging to various Arab carriers. Israel defended its actions by informing the Lebanese government that it was responsible for encouraging the PFLP. The retaliation, which was intended to encourage a Lebanese government crackdown on Palestinian militants, instead polarized Lebanese society <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> question, deepening the divide between pro- and anti-Palestinian factions, with the Muslims leading the former grouping and Maronites primarily constituting the latter. This dispute reflected increasing tensions between Christian and Muslim communities over the distribution of political power, and would ultimately foment the outbreak of civil war in 1975.|$|E
25|$|In June 2007, Hamas {{took control}} of the Gaza Strip {{in the course of the}} Battle of Gaza, seizing {{government}} institutions and replacing Fatah and other government officials with its own. Following the takeover, Egypt and Israel imposed a partial blockade, on the grounds that Fatah had fled and was no longer providing security <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> side, and to prevent arms smuggling by terrorist groups. On 6 September 2007, the Israeli Air Force destroyed a nuclear reactor in Syria. On 28 February 2008, Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the constant firing of Qassam rockets by Hamas militants. On July 16, 2008, Hezbollah swapped the bodies of Israeli soldiers Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, kidnapped in 2006, in exchange for the Lebanese terrorist Samir Kuntar, four Hezbollah prisoners, and the bodies of 199 Palestinian Arab and Lebanese fighters.|$|E
