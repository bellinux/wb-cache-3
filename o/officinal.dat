6000|$|This is Lord Byron, {{and is one}} of {{the finest}} things he has said. I have no town talk for you, as I have not been much among people--as for Politics they are in my opinion only sleepy because they will soon be too wide awake. Perhaps not--for the long and {{continued}} Peace of England itself has given us notions of personal safety which are likely to prevent the re-establishment of our national Honesty. There is, of a truth, nothing manly or sterling in any part of the Government. There are many Madmen in the Country I have no doubt, who would like to be beheaded on tower Hill merely for the sake of éclat, there are many Men like Hunt who from a principle of taste would like to see things go on better, there are many like Sir F. Burdett who like to sit at the head of political dinners,--but there are none prepared to suffer in obscurity for their Country--The motives of our worst men are Interest and of our best Vanity. We have no Milton, no Algernon Sidney--Governors in these days lose the title of Man in exchange for that of Diplomat and Minister. We breathe in a sort of <b>Officinal</b> Atmosphere--All the departments of Government have strayed far from Simplicity which is the greatest of Strength there is as much difference in this respect between the present Government and Oliver Cromwell's as there is between the 12 Tables of Rome and the volumes of Civil Law which were digested by Justinian. A Man now entitled Chancellor has the same honour paid to him whether he be a Hog or a Lord Bacon. No sensation is created by Greatness but by the number of Orders a Man has at his Button holes. Notwithstanding the part which the Liberals take in the Cause of Napoleon, I cannot but think he has done more harm to the life of Liberty than any one else could have done: not that the divine right Gentlemen have done or intend to do any good--no they have taken a Lesson of him, and will do all the further harm he would have done without any of the good. The worst thing he has done is, that he has taught them how to organise their monstrous armies. The Emperor Alexander it is said intends to divide his Empire as did Diocletian--creating two Czars besides himself, and continuing the supreme Monarch of the whole. Should he do this and they for a series of Years keep peaceable among themselves Russia may spread her conquest even to China--I think it a very likely thing that China itself may fall, Turkey certainly will. Meanwhile European north Russia will hold its horns against the rest of Europe, intriguing constantly with France. Dilke, whom you know to be a Godwin perfectibility Man, pleases himself with the idea that America will be the country to take up the human intellect where England leaves off--I differ there with him greatly--A country like the United States, whose greatest Men are Franklins and Washingtons will never do that. They are great Men doubtless, but how are they to be compared to those our countrymen Milton and the two Sidneys? The one is a philosophical Quaker full of mean and thrifty maxims, the other sold the very Charger who had taken him through all his Battles. Those Americans are great, but they are not sublime Man--the humanity of the United States can never reach the sublime. Birkbeck's mind is too much in the American style--you must endeavour to infuse a little Spirit of another sort into the settlement, always with great caution, for thereby you may do your descendants more good than you may imagine. If I had a prayer to make for any great good, next to Tom's recovery, it should be that one of your Children should be the first American Poet.

Methods: In an experimental study, 21 balb/C male mice were randomly designated to three equal groups. Group I was treated with normal saline and groups II and III were respectively treated with 0. 450 and 1. 350 g/kg, hydroalcoholic extract of Melissa <b>officinals</b> daily for two weeks, intraperitoneally. Then on 15 th day of the experiment, blood samples {{were obtained from the}} heart. The blood was centrifuged and then the sera were evaluated for alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, urea and creatinine, using autoanalyzer and commercial kits. The liver and kidney tissues were also hystopathologically evaluated. The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc test, and Kruskal-Wallis at a significance level of p< 0. 05. Results: Melissa <b>officinals</b> dose dependently caused a significant reduction in alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase levels compared to the control group. Furthermore, Melissa <b>officinals</b> extract had no effect on the amount of urea and creatinine compared to the control group. The liver and kidney histopathological changes in the groups that received different doses of the extract showed mild, moderate, and severe tissue injuries. Conclusion: The biochemical analysis in this study indicates that the extract of Melissa <b>officinals</b> causes liver tissue damage in mice; therefore, its consumption in high doses should be avoided. </p...|$|R

The most important active principles are hypericin and flavones. For the identification of flavones an <b>officinal</b> method in FR X was used, whereas for the hypericin - an <b>officinal</b> method in the European Pharmacopoeia. The obtained results led to the conclusion that H. maculatum has the highest content of total hypericins (0. 496 g%) as well as flavonoids (6. 418 g%). In the European Pharmacopoeia the St. John’s wort monograph specifies the exact content of hypericin of the vegetable product (determined through the spectophotometric method), of 0. 08 g% total hypericin. Given this fact, all the studied Hypericum species fit within the limits imposed by the E. Ph. There is no stipulation in FR X regarding the limits of hypericin concentrations or of other active principles that can be found in Hyperici herba extracts...|$|E

Ghirardi” (BGG, Toscolano Maderno - Brescia) of the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences of the Milan University {{has a long}} {{tradition}} in the cultivation, study and preservation of the genetic resources of <b>officinal</b> species, in accordance with the priority tasks of the Convention on Biodiversity. Recently a dedicated research project started, integrating multidisciplinary analyses on target <b>officinal</b> species preserved at BGG, with the principal aim of characterizing these “plants” as interacting components of their own ecosystem. Indeed, the project was planned combining a dual perception: phytocentric, through the study of the biotic mutualistic interactions, mediated by the emission of secondary metabolites, and anthropocentric, referring to the potential importance to humans in the therapeutic, food and cosmetic sectors. The work program includes: (i) the census of the plant heritage preserved at BGG; (ii) the selection of targetspecies for the morphological characterization of the secretory tissues and for the analysis of phytochemical profiles; (iii) the analysis of the biological activities of the secondary metabolites; (iv) case-studies on their ecological and functional roles. In this perspective, BGG will represent a “natural laboratory” for studying the morphological and phytochemical diversity of <b>officinal</b> plants in an integrated ecological framework, aiming at assessing their importance for potential future exploitation by humans. As preliminary activities of the project, we addressed our interest towards {{a better understanding of the}} micro-morphology and anatomy of the secreting structures, and on the characterization of VOC and essential oil profile of target-species belonging to the Lamiaceae family: Ballota acetabulosa Benth., Ballota rupestris Vis., Lavandula angustifolia Mill., Lavandula dentata L., Salvia greggii Grey, Scutellaria sieberi Benth., Scutellaria altissima L. and Scutellaria brevibracteata Stapf. We report the results of the preliminary micromorphological observations on a) the structure and distribution of glandular tissues, b) the histochemical nature of the secreted substances, c) the mode of production and release of the secretory products. In addition, the VOC fingerprint and the characterization of essential oil produced in the glandular tissues are presented...|$|E
40|$|From {{very old}} times plants {{were used for}} man or animal health, with good results in slightly, {{functional}} injuries or in incipient stages of diseases. In chronic, when already appeared organic affection, <b>officinal</b> plants has an adjuvant part and can contributes to a partial reversibility of symptoms or lesions. This study was been performed using aqueous solutions or essential oils from Mentha spicata, Ocimum basilicum, Thymus vulgaris and Rosa sp. with bacterial cultures on usual or special culture mediums of Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica and Staphylococcus aureus. In view of antibacterial assay emphasizing were been used small pieces of absorbent paper immersed in solutions or essential oils above mentioned <b>officinal</b> plants. These pieces of papers then were been deposed in usual and special culture mediums containing the mentioned species of bacteria and then incubated 24 hours. The obtained result emphasized by the inhibition areas development recommend the antibacterial effect of essential oils of Rosa sp. (25. 5 mm inhibition area), Mentha spicata (16. 5 mm), Thymus vulgaris (7. 3 mm) and Ocimum basilicum (5. 1 mm) in therapeutic purpose, both in intern and extern way in infections caused by Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Staphylococcus aureus, in incipient stages...|$|E
