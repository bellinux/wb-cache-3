40|$|Objective. The aim of {{the study}} was to compare under in vitro {{conditions}} marginal sealing of 4 different bulk-fill materials composite <b>restorations</b> <b>of</b> class II. Methods. Comparative evaluation concerned 4 composites of a bulk-fill type: SonicFill, Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill, Filtek Bulk Fill, and SDR. The study used 30 third molars without caries. In each tooth 4 cavities of class II were prepared. The prepared tooth samples were placed in a 1 % methylene blue solution for 24 [*]h, and after that in each <b>restoration</b> the depth <b>of</b> dye penetration along the side walls was evaluated. Results. The highest rating (score 0, no dye penetration) was achieved by 93. 33 % <b>of</b> the <b>restorations</b> made <b>of</b> the SDR material, 90 % <b>of</b> <b>restorations</b> <b>of</b> SonicFill system, 86. 66 % <b>of</b> <b>restorations</b> <b>of</b> the composite Filtek Bulk Fill, and 73. 33 % <b>of</b> <b>restorations</b> <b>of</b> the Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill. Conclusion. The performed study showed that bulk-fill flowable or sonic-activated flowable composite restorations have better marginal sealing (lack of discoloration) in comparison with bulk-fill paste-like composite...|$|R

5|$|The Historic Chapels Trust {{obtained}} {{an estimate}} for the restoration, which amounted to £2.5m. Unable {{to meet the}} full amount, the Trust decided to undertake the restoration in phases.

Of the money raised for this, £262,500 came from the Heritage Lottery Fund, £200,000 from English Heritage, £250,000 from Stoke-on-Trent City Council, and a further £20,000 was raised locally. The second phase <b>of</b> <b>restoration</b> commenced in August 2010 and was completed a year later. The Trust spent £600,000 restoring the galleries, staircases and pulpits, replacing the organ and renovating the exterior ironwork. Funds are currently being raised for the final phase <b>of</b> <b>restoration,</b> which will include installation of a new heating and lighting system.|$|E
