5|$|In {{the second}} part, Nico Rosberg was fastest, {{half a second}} faster than {{teammate}} Hamilton, and 1.7 seconds clear of the pole position lap time from the year before. Both McLarens had shown promising pace, but nevertheless dropped out of contention in 12th and 14th, while Daniil Kvyat was the last driver to secure a place in Q3, demoting Carlos Sainz Jr. to 11th. Kvyat's Red Bull teammate Daniel Ricciardo also progressed, albeit suffering a failure of his wing mirror, which hung <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his vehicle during his last timed lap. Eliminated at the back were both Haas drivers, along Nico Hülkenberg, who was unable to follow his teammate Pérez into Q3 and qualified 13th.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} leg, on Friday, 2 May, at the seventh {{kilometre}} of the 18th stage, Corte–Taverna, Toivonen's Lancia went <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> {{the road at}} a tight left corner with no guardrail. The car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof. The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver's seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded. The fuel tank was not protected by a skid plate, an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. The explosion happened within seconds of the crash, and Toivonen and his co-driver, Sergio Cresto would {{not have time to}} get out had they still been alive. The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4, built of fast-burning kevlar-reinforced plastic composite, was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats. Toivonen left behind wife Erja (married in 1982) and two young children, son Markus and daughter Arla, while Cresto was single with no children.|$|E

5|$|This Amazon {{is famous}} in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; {{some of the}} {{inhabitants}} dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being always in {{the centre of the}} floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that go <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the wall, a pillar betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry to one of these low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix’d; upon this they say she ordinarily laid her helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to have laid her sword: she {{is said to have been}} much addicted to hunting, and that in her time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving as}} regimental quartermaster, Grant yearned for a combat role; when finally allowed, {{he led a}} cavalry charge at the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, demonstrating his equestrian ability at Monterrey by {{carrying}} a dispatch past snipers while hanging <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his horse, keeping the animal {{between him and the}} enemy. Before leaving the city he stopped at a house occupied by wounded Americans, giving them assurance he would send for help. Polk, wary of Taylor's growing popularity, divided his forces, sending some troops (including Grant's unit) to form a new army under Major General Winfield Scott. Traveling by sea, Scott's army landed at Veracruz and advanced toward Mexico City. The army met the Mexican forces at the battles of Molino del Rey and Chapultepec outside Mexico City. For his bravery at Molino del Rey, Grant was brevetted first lieutenant. At San Cosmé, men under Grant's direction dragged a disassembled howitzer into a church steeple, reassembled it, and bombarded nearby Mexican troops. His bravery and initiative earned him his second brevet promotion to captain. On September 14, 1847, Scott's army marched into the city; Mexico ceded the vast territory, including California, to the U.S. on February 2, 1848.|$|E

25|$|Chicago's first {{touchdown}} {{resulted on}} a New York punt attempt {{from their own}} 12, forcing Sean Landeta to make the kick three yards into his goal line. As Landeta dropped the ball to kick it, the wind altered the ball's descent and caused it to go <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his foot. As a result, the ball went right {{into the ground and}} bounced a short distance before reserve safety Shaun Gayle picked it up and returned the -7 yard punt five yards for a touchdown. Gayle's run was the shortest punt return touchdown in NFL history.|$|E
25|$|Hinckley wounded {{police officer}} Thomas Delahanty and Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy, and {{critically}} wounded press secretary James Brady. Hinckley did not hit Reagan directly, but seriously wounded him when a bullet ricocheted <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the presidential limousine {{and hit him}} in the chest. Hinckley did not try to flee and was arrested at the scene. All of the shooting victims survived. Brady was hit in {{the right side of the}} head, and endured a long recuperation period, remaining paralyzed on the left side of his body until his death on August 4, 2014. Brady's death was ruled a homicide 33 years after the shooting.|$|E
25|$|In January 1948, Paul {{shattered}} {{his right}} arm and elbow in a near-fatal automobile accident on an icy Route 66 west of Davenport, Oklahoma. Mary Ford was driving the Buick convertible, which plunged <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a railroad overpass and dropped twenty feet into a ravine; they were returning from Wisconsin to Los Angeles after visiting family. Doctors at Oklahoma City's Wesley Presbyterian Hospital told Paul {{that they could not}} rebuild his elbow. Their other option was amputation. Paul was flown to Los Angeles, where his arm was set at an angle—just under 90 degrees—that allowed him to cradle and pick the guitar. It took him nearly {{a year and a half}} to recover.|$|E

25|$|During the Palaeozoic era {{at least}} a few {{thousand}} kilometres of ocean floor were subducted, taking of the order of a hundred million years. Sediments were deposited in the ocean floor in the form of fans formed by turbidity currents <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a continental slope. The flow was in the northerly direction, indicating that the continental slope was to the south. These deposits occurred during the Ordovician period. The ocean floor was distant from the continental source of the sediment. Towards the end of this period there were isolated parts where no turbidity currents reached and only fine clay and animal organic and silica debris were deposited into oxygen-depleted deep water. This ocean basin has been called the Monaro Basin. To the north west was a volcanic chain of islands, the Macquarie arc, with an associated submarine trench.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Ready for the Plaintiff, Belli noted {{examples}} of negligence cited {{by himself and}} other personal-injury lawyers to win in court—for example, a colleague in Florida, who showed how a builder violated a building code in Miami Beach concerning the use of wooden shims in construction of outside walls (forbidden by the municipal code because {{of the effect of}} the ocean salt and air). The facing was a slab of Vitreous marble, whose adhesion was eventually weakened by the climate; it fell <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the building and injured a passerby, who sued the builder. After winning a court case, Belli would raise a Jolly Roger flag over his Montgomery Street office building in the Barbary Coast district of San Francisco (which Belli claimed had been a Gold Rush-era brothel) and fire a cannon, mounted on his office roof, to announce the victory and the impending party.|$|E
25|$|Although {{trampoline}} {{competitors are}} highly trained, {{they are also}} attempting to perform complex manoeuvres {{which could lead to}} accidents and falls. Trampolines used in competitions have their springs covered in pads to reduce the chance of injury when landing off the bed. They also have padded end decks, which are the locations that athletes are most likely to fall off the trampoline. The rules for international competitions (updated by FIG in 2006) also require 200mm thick mats on the floor for 2 metres around each trampoline and for there to be four spotters whose task it is to attempt to catch or reduce the impact of an athlete falling <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the trampoline bed. The floor matting rules are typically adopted by national bodies but not always in full; for example in the UK the requirement for National & Regional competition is still 2m but only of 20–25mm matting.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of twig, {{vegetative}} twigs and fruiting spurs. Fruiting spurs are specialized twigs that generally branch <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> branches and are stubby and slow-growing, with many annular ring markings from seasons past. The age and rate of growth of a twig can be determined by counting the winter terminal bud scale scars, or annular ring marking, {{down the length of the}} twig.|$|R
50|$|Muskets were smoothbore, large caliber weapons using ball-shaped {{ammunition}} {{fired at}} relatively low velocity. Due {{to the high}} cost and great difficulty of precision manufacturing, {{and the need to}} load readily from the muzzle, the musket ball was a loose fit in the barrel. Consequently, on firing <b>the</b> ball bounced <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barrel when fired and the final direction on leaving the muzzle was unpredictable.|$|R

25|$|It was {{not until}} six days later that her remains, which were in an {{advanced}} state of decomposition, {{were found in the}} weeds a few feet <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a scarcely traveled road in Holmes County, Ohio. She had been strangled and sexually assaulted with a vibrator and a large plastic bag had been wrapped around her legs. Because of the condition of her remains, police were not able to identify the body until Harrison's father confirmed that it was his daughter. A Budweiser towel, a bloody car seat box, a wad of Harrison's hair, gloves, a plaid shirt and jeans were all found {{in the vicinity of the}} dump site. Examination of the remains indicated that the body was subjected to high temperatures, which was likely a consequence of her body remaining inside of the vehicle for a long period of time during summer weather. Krista was buried in the Maple Grove Cemetery in Marshallville.|$|E
25|$|Clarice is apprehended by Hartman and, upon disparaging both him and {{his dead}} daughter, is {{shot in the head}} as the others watch from a distance. Jackson and Bud {{continue}} on with Elizabeth in tow. As a Deputy passes, Elizabeth screams out, inadvertently leading to Bud getting shot. Bud's death sends Jackson into a rage, as he kills the Deputy and has Elizabeth drive them in the deputy's vehicle in attempt to reach safety. During their drive, the two are pursued by the deranged Hartman, who opens fire on the two with one of the bullets severing Jackson's face and causing the vehicle to careen <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the road. Later that night, Elizabeth awakes handcuffed in Hartman's car and answers a dispatch call, alerting Sorells to her location. Sorells visits Verna and reveals to her that Hartman has Jedidiah at the old barn where Betty was killed. Verna feeds Sorells to her pigs and then gathers the family to converge on Hartman's location. At the barn, Hartman takes Elizabeth and the injured Jackson hostage, revealing that Jackson is Jedidiah Sawyer. Verna arrives and Hartman is soon incapacitated by the other Sawyers.|$|E

Not seeing any progress, Weiss orders Al to leave, but Al pushes the doctor aside.
