5|$|Beginning on 15 May, Murat's {{home was}} searched, the pool drained, his cars, computers, phones and video tapes examined, his garden searched using ground radar and sniffer dogs, {{and two of}} his {{associates}} questioned. In March 2008, one of those associates had his car torched, with the word fala ("speak") sprayed in red <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement.</b>|$|E
5|$|A CNN film crew, {{who were}} there on a routine check for a {{possible}} Falun Gong protest, observed a man sitting down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> northeast of the Monument to the People's Heroes at {{the centre of the}} square. He proceeded to pour gasoline over himself and set himself ablaze. Police officers quickly congregated on the scene and extinguished the flames. Shortly afterwards, another four people on the square set themselves alight. One of the four, a man, was detained and driven away in a police van.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, USAC split its National Championship into {{dirt and}} {{pavement}} championships. Andretti had one win <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> and finished {{fifth in the}} season points, and {{finished second in the}} dirt championship. He competed in USAC's dirt track division in 1974, and won the dirt track championship while competing in both series. Andretti also competed in the North American Formula 5000 series in 1973 and 1974, and finished second in the championship in both seasons.|$|E

50|$|Opus alexandrinum {{is another}} form of opus sectile, where but few colors are used, such as white and black, or dark green on a red ground, or vice versa. This term is {{particularly}} employed to designate a species of geometrical mosaic, found in combination with large slabs of marble, much used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavements</b> of medieval Roman churches and even in Renaissance times, as, for instance, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavements</b> of <b>the</b> Sistine Chapel and the stanza of the Segnatura.|$|R

5|$|New {{building}} techniques introduced {{with this}} set include a systematic way of building numbers. On {{the front of}} the building the year 1932 appears, which is a reference to when LEGO was founded. The number 3 also appears <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> of the set representing that this is the 3rd set on the series from Lego set designer Jamie Berard (he had previously designed Café Corner and Green Grocer).|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} Warwick and Montagu {{were laid out}} 'on the morrow after' and 'openly shewed and naked' in St. Paul's, to prevent rumour {{starting}} that they had in fact survived the battle; Warkworth too said that the King personally directed this, and arranged for the corpses 'to {{be put in a}} cart... to be laid in the church of Paul's, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement,</b> that every man might see them; and so they lay for three or four days' before granting permission to their brother George for their burial at Bisham Priory.|$|E
5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E

5|$|Forza Motorsport 4 was {{featured}} in the U.S. version of Top Gear. At the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards professional stunt driver and show co-host Tanner Foust and Rutledge Wood, car expert and co-host were featured in the unveiling of the game. Foust drove a 2010 Dodge Challenger while Wood rode as a passenger. The advertisement showed Foust drifting around the environment and ended with a top-down shot of the pad. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> the word Forza was spelled out in tire marks. Additionally in the final episode of the show's second season Wood and co-host Adam Ferrara challenged Foust to a timed race at Infineon Raceway, otherwise known as Sears Point; Foust drove the Lexus LF-A around the real course while Wood and Ferrara drove the course in Forza Motorsport 4.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the success of the tour, the band was not without at least one serious altercation which has since been widely publicized. After playing a {{sell-out}} show in Glasgow, Scotland, members of the band and crew were involved in heavy drinking. After a brief amount of time, vocalist Randy Blythe, whilst wearing a quilt and attempting to speak with a Scottish accent, became verbally violent towards both drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Mark Morton, the later of whom then struck Blythe from behind on the bus in response. The incident developed into grabbing, pushing and separating until Blythe and Morton then encountered each other outside on the footpath. The fight between the two was especially lackluster due to intoxication, however it resulted in Morton bringing Blythe down hard <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> beneath him briefly incapacitating Blythe. Two days and at least one show later, the duo reconciled over drinks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the image}} {{selected}} by McCartney, the group {{walk across the}} street in single file from left to right, with Lennon leading, followed by Starr, McCartney, and Harrison. McCartney is barefoot and {{out of step with the}} other members. Apart from Harrison, the group are wearing suits designed by Tommy Nutter. To the left of the picture, parked next to the zebra crossing, is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for £2,530 and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany. The man standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> to the right of the picture is Paul Cole (7 July 1911– 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the original cover, McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney.|$|E

5|$|The {{garden was}} {{saved by the}} Member of {{parliament}} Albert Grant, who purchased the park in 1874 for £11,060 and donated it to the Metropolitan Board of Works. The title deed for the square passed to the succeeding public bodies {{and is now in}} the ownership of the City of Westminster. After the purchase, the architect James Knowles redesigned the park. A statue of William Shakespeare surrounded by dolphins was constructed in the centre. The four corner gates of the park had one bust each of famous former residents in the square: the scientist Sir Isaac Newton designed by W. Calder Marshall; Sir Joshua Reynolds, the first President of the Royal Academy by H. Weekes; John Hunter, a pioneer of surgery, by T. Wooler; and William Hogarth, the painter, by J. Durham. Ownership transferred to Westminster City Council in 1933. The most recent addition was a bronze statue of film star and director Charlie Chaplin, designed by sculptor John Doubleday in 1981. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> were inscribed the distances in miles to several Commonwealth countries, including Canada, Kenya and Jamaica. After the Great Outdoors refurbishment of the square, only the statue of Shakespeare still remains.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Sanchez's plane is hijacked was filmed on {{location}} in Florida, with stuntman Jake Lombard jumping from a helicopter to a plane and Dalton himself being filmed atop the aircraft. The plane towed by the helicopter was a life-sized model created by special effects supervisor John Richardson. After filming wide shots of David Hedison and Dalton parachuting, closer shots were made near the church location. During one of the takes, a malfunction of the harness equipment caused Hedison to fall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement.</b> The injury made him limp {{for the remainder of}} filming. The aquatic battle between Bond and the henchmen required two separate units, a surface one led by Arthur Wooster which used Dalton himself, and an underwater one which involved experienced divers. The barefoot waterskiing was done by world champion Dave Reinhart, with some close-ups using Dalton on a special rig. Milton Krest's death used a prosthetic head which was created by John Richardson's team based on a mould of Anthony Zerbe's face. The result was so gruesome that it was shortened and toned down to avoid censorship problems.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Jenner {{encountered}} {{a group of}} men from the Glanton Exclusive Brethren {{standing in front of the}} National Australia Bank on Collins Street. One of the men was engaging in open-air preaching. Jenner interrupted the man to say that he would listen to the man's good news provided that he was allowed to share some good news first. The man agreed, so Jenner taught the group of Brethren how to play craps there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement.</b> One of the Brethren invited Jenner into his home for tea and told him about the gospel. Jenner converted to Christianity and, when he went home, told Jessie that she was a sinner bound for hell and therefore in need of salvation. According to Wilson's biography of Jenner, Jessie thought that Jenner had become manic or insane. They had a young daughter named Ann by this point and Jenner was gambling so much that he was not providing for his family. For both of these reasons, Jessie left Jenner and moved to Corowa to work on a farm, taking Ann with her. She said that she would return only when Jenner regained his sanity. On several occasions, he aggressively told Jessie's brothers that they needed to become Christians, which angered them. On one of these occasions, their conversation became physical and they began punching each other. The brothers rejected Jenner and were never reconciled to him. He wrote to his family back in England informing them of his conversion and asking them to become Christians too, but he received no reply.|$|E

40|$|When {{considering}} {{an accessible}} and comfortable city for every person-including the elderly, the physically disabled, pregnant women. women with children, the sick, and so <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> author investigated the actual condition of two square kilometers of Iizuka City's downtown area. In the investigated area, the average person's life span {{is higher than}} the Japanese average. In this report, the actual condition of pavements and pedestrian bridges is discussed. The most busy road in this area, Route 200, keeps its pavement areas in quite good condition, whereas Route 201 has difficult conditions with narrow pavements made occasionally even narrower by telegraph poles, signal poles, traffic sign poles, and so <b>on.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavements</b> of <b>the</b> commercial area there are sometimes signboards, goods being pushed about, parked bicycles, motorcycles, and cars parked which further narrows <b>the</b> <b>pavements.</b> Even out of the commercial area, there are cars parked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavements.</b> <b>The</b> pedestrian bridges in the investigated area nearly fit Fukuoka's prefectural bylaws. However it is doubtful that the existence of pedestrian bridges is good for every person walking-especially physically disabled people...|$|R
