5|$|Many of Oppenheimer's {{associates}} in {{the years}} before World War II were Communist Party USA members.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had opened a file on Oppenheimer in March 1941, after he had attended a December 1940 meeting at Chevalier's home that was also attended by the Communist Party's California state secretary William Schneiderman and its treasurer Isaac Folkoff, both of whom were targets <b>of</b> <b>FBI</b> surveillance and wiretaps.
