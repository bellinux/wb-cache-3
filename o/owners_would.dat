The Burden Ironworks is said to have supplied all the Union Army's horseshoes, and another local ironworks supplied the USS Monitors hull plating.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the Western Australia state government allocated relief funds to offset the cost of recovery and clean-up in several of the affected towns. Individuals and families became eligible to apply for personal grants and small business <b>owners</b> <b>would</b> be considered for special interest rates on new loans. Local government entities listed under the proclamation were the shires of Ashburton, Broome, East Pilbara, Meekatharra, and the Town of Port Hedland. Disaster assistance money in these jurisdictions would be used to restore public assets and infrastructure impaired by the storm. The name Lua was later retired from the cyclical list of tropical cyclone names due to the system's adverse effects on land and was replaced by the name Luana.|$|E
5|$|Kennywood Entertainment, {{itself an}} {{operator}} of a family-owned park, had acquired other family-owned and operated parks after its purchase of Idlewild in 1983. Kennywood's owners rejected offers by larger companies {{to purchase the}} group, such as one in 1997 by Premier Parks, the company that acquired the Six Flags franchise a year later. Kennywood refused the Premier offer and others on grounds that the new <b>owners</b> <b>would</b> make too many changes to the existing parks. However, on December 11, 2007, Kennywood Entertainment {{announced that it would}} sell its parks to the Madrid-based amusement company, Parques Reunidos. The fourth- and fifth-generation family ownership of Kennywood ensured that with the transaction all of the company's parks would experience few changes and that day-to-day park operations would remain local.|$|E

For example: the <b>owner</b> <b>would</b> select a particular work task, such as installing a square yard of carpeting. The <b>owner</b> <b>would</b> then establish the price that they were willing to pay for installation of one square yard. The price would include the direct cost of materials, equipment, and labor. The <b>owner</b> <b>would</b> not include any profit or overhead in that price.|$|R

5|$|The {{great number}} of Russian horses {{captured}} as mat√©riel during wartime became {{a threat to the}} Finnhorse's purebreeding: many Russian animals were stallions, {{and there was no way}} to ensure new <b>owners</b> <b>would</b> not crossbreed them with Finnhorses. For practical and political reasons, Soviet Russia would not accept these horses back as a part of Finland's massive war indemnity. Finnhorses however, were accepted as payment, and a total of 18000 animals were sold to Soviet Russia at low rates in 1947 and 1948. The best Finnhorses were not offered to the Soviets, however, and according to contemporary witnesses, many showy but otherwise useless horses ended up in Russia.|$|E
5|$|The predilection of the Welsh for roasted cheese led to {{the dish}} of Welsh rarebit, or Welsh rabbit, {{seasoned}} melted cheese poured over toasted bread. The cheese {{would need to be}} a harder one, such as chedder or similar. Referred to as Welsh rabbit as early as 1725, the name is not similar to the Welsh term caws pobi. Welsh folk rarely ate rabbit due to the cost and as land <b>owners</b> <b>would</b> not allow rabbit hunting, so the term is more likely a slur on the Welsh. The name evolved from rabbit to rarebit, possibly to remove the slur from Welsh cuisine or due to simple reinterpretation of the word to make menus more pleasant.|$|E
5|$|On March 6, 2014, the FCC {{announced}} that it would hold a vote on March 31 on a proposal to ban joint sales agreements involving television stations outright, making them attributable to FCC ownership limits if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time of a competing junior partner station in the JSA; the ban applies to both existing sharing agreements under such a structure as well as pending station transactions that include a JSA. Station <b>owners</b> <b>would</b> be given a two-year grace period to unwind or modify joint sales agreements in violation of the policy; coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market would also be barred under the proposal. Wheeler also proposed an expedited process to review joint sales agreements on a case-by-case basis, granting a waiver of the rules if a broadcaster can prove a particular joint sales agreement arrangement serves the public interest.|$|E
50|$|The arcade <b>owner</b> <b>would</b> buy a base cabinet, {{while the}} games were stored on {{standard}} audio cassettes. The arcade <b>owner</b> <b>would</b> insert the cassette and a security dongle into the cabinet. When the cabinet was powered up, the program from the tape would be copied into the cabinet's RAM chips; this process took about two to three minutes. After this, the game could be played freely until the cabinet was rebooted.|$|R
50|$|Ultimately, the {{selection}} committee {{will provide the}} owner with a final rank ordering of the shortlisted firms. The <b>owner</b> <b>would</b> then invite the top-ranked firm {{to enter into negotiations}} to establish compensation and other contractual terms.

5|$|The players union {{encouraged}} {{players to}} find work overseas, hoping <b>owners</b> <b>would</b> offer better deals if they saw players having more options. Josh Childress, who played for Greek team Olympiacos {{before returning to the}} NBA in 2010, said he would not consider playing overseas during the lockout. He cited concerns with reliability of getting paid, differences in coaching styles, and lower standards of business travel compared to the NBA. The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) announced on July 29 that it would allow players under NBA contracts to play overseas, provided that the contracts they signed had opt-out clauses that allowed players to return once the work stoppage ended. Stern said the league would allow players to play overseas, but he warned that it could divide the union and possibly jeopardize players' contracts if they were seriously injured. Most leagues permitted the signing of locked-out NBA players with the option of opting out; the Chinese Basketball Association, however, only allowed its clubs to sign foreign free agents who could play for at least the entire season. Chinese nationals were exempt from this rule; this allowed Yi Jianlian to return to the NBA upon the end of the lockout.|$|E

25|$|The IWW was {{condemned}} by {{politicians and the}} press, who saw them {{as a threat to}} the market systems as well as an effort to monopolize labor at a time when efforts to monopolize industries were being fought as anti-market.

They envisioned an eventual end to confrontation and strikes. The WFM was unprepared for the determination and power that mine <b>owners</b> <b>would</b> bring to bear during struggles for union rights.|$|E

Buying lighter animals and placing them in pastures before sending them to feedlot is the most profitable as well as least risky option.

25|$|Taxi drivers' {{interests}} {{and those of}} owners are not necessarily aligned. Hong Kong Taxi Owners Association represents owners of taxi licences, and drivers, who are most frequently are not owners but who rent their vehicles on a daily basis, are represented by the Motor Transport Workers General Union. In 2013, day-time drivers would pay upwards of HK$380 for each shift, and night shift drivers would pay HK$350. <b>Owners</b> <b>would</b> dispute with drivers' groups as they seek to increase the daily rental charge each time taxi fares increased.|$|E
25|$|Slaves {{can be an}} {{attractive}} investment because the slave-owner only needs to pay for sustenance and enforcement. This is sometimes lower than the wage-cost of free labourers, because free workers earn more than sustenance, in these cases slaves have positive price. When the cost of sustenance and enforcement exceeds the wage rate, slave-owning {{would no longer be}} profitable, and <b>owners</b> <b>would</b> simply release their slaves. Slaves are thus a more attractive investment in high-wage environments, and environments where enforcement is cheap, and less attractive in environments where the wage-rate is low and enforcement is expensive.|$|E
25|$|The African {{population}} {{on the island}} began to hear of the agitation for independence by the rich European planters, the grands blancs, who had resented France's limitations on the island's foreign trade. The Africans mostly allied with the royalists and the British, as they understood that if Saint-Domingue's independence were to be led by white slave masters, it would probably mean even harsher treatment and increased injustice for the African population. The plantation <b>owners</b> <b>would</b> be free to operate slavery as they pleased without the existing minimal accountability to their French peers.|$|E
