50|$|As {{the twentieth}} century progressed, this circumlocutive system of addressing, with its innumerable ambiguities and {{opportunities}} for <b>unintentional</b> <b>offence,</b> was increasingly felt as a nuisance. An early way out was to carry the circumlocutions one degree further—finding impersonal ways of saying what was needful, avoiding both personal pronoun and title (Får det lov att vara en kopp kaffe?, approximately 'Might it be a cup of coffee?'; Så det är till att resa?, approximately 'So, it is about travelling?'), often using the passive voice. However, that soon proved of little avail. For one thing, you still had to address the person you talked with directly {{from time to time}} in the conversation, otherwise you would really have sounded impolite—and over time, it became de rigueur to do so more and more often, until it was a system with both longish titles used instead of personal pronouns and impersonal circumlocutions; and for another, the impersonal constructions soon acquired their own gradations, to be observant upon—e.g., that in the second example above being perceived as more and more rustic, ending up rude.|$|R

Information is provided for three age groups (0 - 4, 5 - 9 and 10 - 14) for each year; information is also presented {{on the top}} five causes of hospitalised injury to children in Australia. Almost half a million children were hospitalised {{as a result of}} an injury during the reporting period, boys outnumbering girls by a factor of 2 to 1. Falls were the main cause of hospitalised injury (n = 193, 141), and transport-related injuries were also common (n = 66, 864). For all but one cause, cases of hospitalised injury were more numerous in boys compared with girls: for the category of intentional self-harm 3, 514 girls were hospitalised compared with 837 boys. Falls and <b>other</b> <b>unintentional</b> injuries were the most frequent causes of hospitalised injury in each of the three age groups. The most frequent cause of hospitalised falls in children aged up to 9 was falls involving playground equipment. At older ages falls involving roller-skates and skateboards were more common. For 0 - 4 year olds poisoning by pharmaceuticals and the effects of exposure to smoke, fire, heat and hot substances accounted for 17 % of hospitalised injuries. In 5 - 9 and 10 - 14 year olds transport incidents accounted for 14 % and 23 % of all hospitalised injuries respectively. The rate of hospitalised injury changed little during the reporting period, there being about 1, 500 cases per 100, 000 children each year. A small (less than 1 %) but statistically significant decline in the rate of hospitalised injury was seen overall during the period. There were no significant changes in the rates of fall injuries, <b>other</b> <b>unintentional</b> injuries, transport injuries and injuries due to the effects of exposure to smoke, fire, heat and hot substances.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 Objective: This article {{reports and}} interprets {{estimates}} of global incidence of major limb amputation due to traumatic causes. Design: A secondary database descriptive study to report amputation incidence and incidence rate per 100, 000 using the extensive 2015 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) results was conducted. Results: In 2015, 1. 2 million people sustained major limb amputations due to traumatic causes worldwide. Leading traumatic causes of limb amputation were war (27. 1 %), <b>other</b> <b>unintentional</b> injuries (18. 4 %), falls (13. 3 %), mechanical forces (10. 5 %) and road injuries (8. 1 %). The highest incidence {{is seen in}} Middle East and North Africa (370, 800 UI 261, 745 to 479, 854) due to high incidence rate followed by South Asia (273, 949 UI 249, 694 to 298, 203) and East Asia (144, 268 UI 132, 996 to 155, 540) due to population size. Discussion: GBD describes etiologies requiring rehabilitation, and regional need for prosthetic services such as upper limb prostheses, pediatrics and surgical considerations.

The author submits- his remarks on the proposed changes and suggests his original legal regulation of some executory problems proving it with reasons. The following questions are {{dealt with in the}} article: changes of sec. 37 of the punishment execution code (hereinafter called the p. e. c.) and of sec. 80 of the penal code (hereinafter called the p. c.) concerning teleological aspects of execution of deprivation of liberty penalty. The author seeks to eliminate double regulating these questions in the p. e. c. and the p. c. The new content of sec. 37 of the p. e. c. is proposed with the allowance made, apart of general resocializing premises, for the certain marigin of punitive treatment of condemned persons not requiring resocialization. Changes in the structure of penal institutions and in grounds for classification of the sentenced persons are also discussed. Two new institutions are to be created in that scope: for the persons sentenced for <b>unintentional</b> <b>offences</b> and for serving the arrest sentence in a case of a petty offence. According to their types penal institutions are to be divided into closed, semi-open and open ones. The criterion of character of an offence is to be eliminated in the classification while the elements related to the personality of a perpetrator are to be more emphasised; psychological and penitentiary examination of the sentenced persons are to be introduced on a wider scale. Sentenced persons have to enjoy more rights while serving their sentences, especially in executory proceedings, in enjoying and exercising religious practices, in self-education, in including, under some conditions, the periods of employment to old age pensions, in extending periods of a rest leave, in assistance in the social adaptation upon release from a penal institution etc. The problem of means of penitentiary treatment: of work, education, cultural and instructional classes as well as of rewards and disciplinary proceedings are also discussed in the article.

Method Qualitative semi-structured interview study with 32 women and 14 men, selected by both purposive and theoretical sampling, from areas of high, average and low deprivation. Results Respondents were highly confident about the efficacy and safety of antibiotics. Reported respondent antibioticuserbehaviours fell into six types, those that: (1) always took antibiotics as prescribed; (2) could not take doses because of work, child care, or social constraints; (3) frequently forgot doses; (4) believed {{it made sense to}} stop taking antibiotics as they started to get better; (5) actively sought to limit antibiotic use because they believed their own bodies became used to them or because antibiotics are ‘unnatural’; and (6) deliberately planned to stop early so as to have an antibiotic supply for self use in the future to avoid the challenges of consulting and obtaining antibiotics in primary care.

40|$|An {{electron}} {{cyclotron resonance}} (ECR) plasma system has been designed {{for the purpose of}} using an excited beam of gases during CBE growth. The system was designed to use hydrogen, nitrogen and argon. An ECR plasma system has the ability to ignite a low pressure and low temperature plasma with very low ion energies, which should minimize any damage to the growing layer. The motivation behind using a plasma during growth is the ability of atomic hydrogen to remove contaminants from the growing layer and to enhance the decomposition of organometallic precursors at low substrate temperatures. InP grown with a hydrogen plasma showed an n-type background carrier concentration of 6. 0 X 1016 cm- 3, with a rough surface and a strong photoluminescence peak at 1. 378 eV. A control sample grown with excess hydrogen but without the plasma had a background carrier concentration of 1. 0 X 1015 cm- 3, a 77 K mobility of 65, 000 cm 2 /V[middle dot]s and a very weak photoluminescence peak at 1. 378 eV.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between students with high risk behavior activity and the behaviors in which they participate. The Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) was developed to monitor significant adolescent risk behaviors. The YRBS was administered to a sample of 9 th through 12 th grade students in two school districts in northern Colorado. A logistic regression model was used to compare students with high risk behavior to their peers with low risk behavior activity. The aim of the study was to assist in the identification of significant risk behaviors that may expand the corresponding knowledge base by which new community and school-based programs could be developed to address these risk behaviors. dolescence is a very impressionable time. Beliefs and values are formed, parental influence diminishes, and peer pressure increases (Gunbaum, Basen-Engquist, 1993). As a result of this suggestible time, many health related behaviors develop.

The highest rates were for injuries caused by violence in 15 - 19 year-old males and were 9319 / 100, 000 /year. CONCLUSIONS: Rates are lower than in more developed countries. However, they appear to represent the more severe end of the spectrum of injury severity. The rates are similar for those below age 10 years and higher for those above age 10 years compared with severe injury rates in other studies. These data are likely to underestimate true rates. The risk of injuries caused by violence increase with age and these injuries are more serious than those due to other causes. Males are at higher risk for all types of injury except traffic injury...|$|R
