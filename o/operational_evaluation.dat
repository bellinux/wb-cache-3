5|$|The AV-8B {{underwent}} standard evaluation {{to prepare}} for its USMC service. In the <b>operational</b> <b>evaluation</b> (OPEVAL), lasting from 31 August 1984 to 30 March 1985, four pilots {{and a group of}} maintenance and support personnel tested the aircraft under combat conditions. The aircraft was graded for its ability to meet its mission requirements for navigating, acquiring targets, delivering weapons, and evading and surviving enemy actions, all at the specified range and payload limits. The first phase of OPEVAL, running until 1 February 1985, required the AV-8B to fly both deep and close air support missions (deep air support missions do not require coordination with friendly ground forces) in concert with other close-support aircraft, as well as flying battlefield interdiction and armed reconnaissance missions. The aircraft flew from military installations at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California, Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake in Canada, and MCAS Yuma in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|The RN's {{final order}} was for 44 ASW aircraft, {{originally}} designated Merlin HAS.1 but soon changed to Merlin HM1. The first fully operational Merlin was delivered on 17 May 1997, entering service on 2 June 2000. All aircraft were {{delivered by the}} end of 2002, and are operated by four Fleet Air Arm squadrons: 814 NAS, 820 NAS, 824 NAS and 829 NAS, all based at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall. 700 NAS was the Merlin <b>Operational</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Unit from 2000 to 2008. In March 2004, Navy Merlins were temporarily grounded following an incident at RNAS Culdrose in which a tail rotor failed due to a manufacturing defect. An improved tail rotor was designed and adopted on most AW101s; according to AgustaWestland, the redesigned rotor also significantly reduced associated maintenance.|$|E

These evaluations are generally managed by DFAT 2 ̆ 7 s country and regional programs. This Review of <b>Operational</b> <b>Evaluations</b> examined 35 such evaluations completed in 2014.

The Review examined the quality of <b>operational</b> <b>evaluations</b> (see Part 1). It found that evaluation quality is good and that they use modest financial and consultant resources. However, {{it is also clear}} that <b>operational</b> <b>evaluations</b> are not being used to their full potential and that DFAT does not have sufficient evaluation capacity to allow large numbers of evaluations to be conducted in-house. The Review makes four recommendations to address these issues. The Review also identified novel or useful lessons on aid and evaluation which were highlighted in <b>operational</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Five such lessons are summarised in Part 2 of the report. Finally, the Review identified good practice evaluation terms of reference, evaluation plans, evaluation reports and management responses...|$|R

To operate the facility and to provide training and <b>operational</b> <b>evaluation</b> in the missile program, Air Defense Command established the 4751st Air Defense Wing (Missile) (4751st ADW) on 15 January 1958.

On 7 December 2011, deliveries to New Zealand formally began with the first two NH90s being airlifted by a leased Antonov An-124 cargo aircraft to RNZAF Base Ohakea.

By April 1998, flight testing of the prototypes was reportedly around half way complete, having accumulated a combined 400 flight hours during testing, further tests focused on flight validation, <b>operational</b> <b>evaluation,</b> and mission equipment functionality.

After the U.S. DoD approved low-rate initial production of the new variant, manufacturing began in 2006, with the first of 22 new UH-60Ms delivered in July 2006. After an initial <b>operational</b> <b>evaluation,</b> the Army approved full-rate production and a five-year contract for 1,227 helicopters in December 2007.

While performing this duty, she logged 200 hours of foilborne operations including day and night, all-weather, and high sea state missions. She also conducted underway replenishments with larger Fleet units and vertical replenishment from helicopters. The latter included medical evacuation operations and the transfers of cargo and fuel.|$|E
