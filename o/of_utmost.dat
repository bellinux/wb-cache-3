5|$|McKellar {{was also}} {{considered}} a capable leader in combat. Aggressive and instinctive, his fighting spirit was {{an inspiration to}} his squadron but according to one biographer, he was highly strung, vociferous and blunt with members of his unit. Nevertheless, his directness and socially confident nature singled him out for command. His dedication to {{his job as a}} fighter pilot and leader led him to refuse any leave from his Squadron while the Battle of Britain lasted. Invariably McKellar led from the front of his unit. He spent a large proportion of his time with his squadron practising combat tactics.

5|$|The {{performance}} of Sarvapitri amavasya rites can also compensate a forgotten or neglected annual Shraddha ceremony, which should ideally {{coincide with the}} death anniversary of the deceased. According to Sharma, the ceremony {{is central to the}} concept of lineages. Shraddha involves oblations to three preceding generationsby reciting their namesas well as to the mythical lineage ancestor (gotra). A person thus gets to know the names of six generations (three preceding generation, his own and two succeeding generationshis sons and grandsons) in his life, reaffirming lineage ties. Anthropologist Usha Menon of Drexel University presents a similar ideathat Pitru Paksha emphasises the fact that the ancestors and the current generation and their next unborn generation are connected by blood ties. The current generation repays their debt to the ancestors in the Pitru Paksha. This debt is considered <b>of</b> <b>utmost</b> importance along with a person's debt to his gurus and his parents.|$|E

5|$|Although Rappe did not {{completely}} {{rule out the}} possibility of a German or British attack on southern Sweden if the opportunity arose, he felt that Russia was the most realistic threat. There were only two plausible scenarios for war with Russia: either Sweden would become involved in a war between Germany and Russia which would feature southern and central Sweden as the battlegroundand Rappe made no attempt to hide which country the General Staff wanted Sweden to side with in that caseor Russia would make a limited attack on Norrbotten to reach northern Norway and the Atlantic, an attack that Rappe earlier said was not very likely. Rappe had played down the strategic importance of the Ofoten and Iron Ore Lines and played up the importance of the main railway line to Boden, which was under discussion at that time, to speed up its completion. The railway to Boden was nearly finished by 1892, negating the need for Rappe to play that political game any longer. A railway line to Boden was <b>of</b> <b>utmost</b> {{need to be able to}} bring up troops to Lule Riverthe main line of defenceand a future fortress there.|$|E
