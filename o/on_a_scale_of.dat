40|$|Applying in situ process diagnostics, we {{identified}} several process drifts {{occurring in the}} parallel plate plasma deposition of microcrystalline silicon (µc-Si:H). These process drifts are powder formation (visible from diminishing dc-bias and changing spatial emission profile <b>on</b> <b>a</b> time <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> 100 s), transient SiH 4 depletion (visible from a decreasing SiH emission intensity <b>on</b> <b>a</b> time <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> 102 s), plasma heating (visible from an increasing substrate temperature <b>on</b> <b>a</b> time <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> 103 s) and a still puzzling long-term drift (visible from a decreasing SiH emission intensity <b>on</b> <b>a</b> time <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> 104 s). The effect of these drifts on the crystalline volume fraction in the deposited films is investigated by {{selected area electron diffraction}} and depth-profiled Raman spectroscopy. An example shows how the transient depletion and long-term drift can be prevented by suitable process control. Solar cells deposited using this process control show enhanced performance. Options for process control of plasma heating and powder formation are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Because of {{the quality}} of his {{maritime}} illustrations, Coggins was invited by publisher Doubleday to provide artwork for a children's book about the U.S. Navy; the author being Fletcher Pratt, the well known military historian. Coggins was invited to participate in Pratt's Naval Game, based on a wargame developed by Fred T. Jane involving dozens of tiny wooden ships, built <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> one inch to fifty feet. These were spread over the floor of Pratt's apartment and their maneuvers were calculated via a complex mathematical formula. The result of Pratt and Coggins's first collaboration, published in 1941, was Fighting Ships of the U.S. Navy, a volume that described in text and illustrated in full color every class of ship in the Navy.|$|E
5|$|Given these shortcomings, any modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons. One such weapon was the Northover Projector, the invention of Major Robert Harry Northover. Northover, {{an officer in the}} Home Guard, designed it to be an easily manufactured and cheap anti-tank weapon, costing just under £10 to produce, excluding the required tripod. The Major wrote directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, with his design and arranged for Churchill to attend a demonstration of the Northover Projector. The Prime Minister approved of the weapon and gave it his personal endorsement, ordering in October 1940 that the weapon be mass-produced <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> one for every Home Guard platoon.|$|E

5|$|Most of Sikkim, {{including}} Gangtok, is underlain by Precambrian rocks {{which contains}} foliated phyllites and schists; slopes are therefore prone to frequent landslides. Surface runoff of water by natural streams (jhora) and man-made drains {{has contributed to}} the risk of landslides. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone-IV (<b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> I to V, in order of increasing seismic activity), near the convergent boundary of the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates and is subject to frequent earthquakes. The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town from the distance. Mount Kanchenjunga (8,598m or 28,208ft)—the world's third-highest peak—is visible {{to the west of the}} city. The existence of steep slopes, vulnerability to landslides, large forest cover and inadequate access to most areas have been a major impediment to the natural and balanced growth of the city.|$|E

At dawn hostile aircraft appeared overhead, which were engaged by the 11th Squadron, forcing them to fly at a higher altitude. By 09:00 the regiment was positioned overlooking Hareira, Sheria, and the Gaza-Beersheba rail line. Several times during the day they were machine gunned by hostile aircraft, but no casualties were sustained. That night at 22:00, as ordered, they returned to Shellal.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{studying}} the horses rate their body condition <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> one (excellent) to five (very poor), based mainly on estimated weight and muscle tone. The horses tend {{to remain in}} above average condition, despite the harsh {{environment in which they}} live, with stallions generally averaging better condition then mares. During severe droughts, the average body score decreases, but even then horses are found with moderate body scores and the entire population is never in very poor condition. The condition of the horses is directly correlated to rainfall, through a correlation to available forage, though temperature, distance between forage and water and individual energy expenditures also play a role. Studies during the 1990s found no evidence of equine disease among the population and few external parasites. Investigations of carcasses found four internal nematode parasites present (strongyles, small and large pinworms and Ascarids), as well as the larvae of botflys.|$|E
