5|$|Michael (Steve Carell), Pam (Jenna Fischer), and Ryan (B. J. Novak) are {{struggling}} {{to adjust to the}} work environment of the new Michael Scott Paper Company. The office space used to be a closet; water pipes run through the room, so they can hear the toilets flush from the Dunder Mifflin bathrooms above them. Ryan openly goofs <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> Pam and Michael and insults both of them in their presence during phone conversations. Pam and Ryan bicker over who is responsible for making copies until Michael separates them into corners. Pam, who joined the company as a saleswoman, is given the corner where the photocopier sits. She is concerned that Michael will force her to be the receptionist, which is why she quit Dunder Mifflin in the first place. She goes upstairs and asks Charles Miner (Idris Elba) for her job back, but Charles has already given the job to a new employee, Kelly Hannon (Ellie Kemper), who ends up going by her middle name—Erin—to avoid confusion with Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling).|$|E
25|$|When a character's true {{nature is}} {{suddenly}} revealed, the devices of hikinuki and bukkaeri are often used. This involves layering one costume over another {{and having a}} stagehand pull the outer one <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the audience.|$|E
25|$|The {{chaperon}} {{was one of}} {{the items}} of male clothing that featured in the charges brought against Joan of Arc at her trial in 1431. This was apparently a hat rather than a hood, as she was stated to have taken it <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the Dauphin – this was cited as further damning evidence of her assuming male behaviours.|$|E

Part of the celebration was making it in the Guinness Book of World Records for the largest bikini parade, followed by pool parties throughout the city. The event kicked <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the sign with a runway-style retrospective featuring bathing suits from the 1950s to today.|$|E
25|$|Humility was an {{important}} principle. No traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else, for example by executing a movement only to show <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> someone who could not perform the movement. If any traceur in {{the group claimed that}} he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.|$|E

25|$|Slivenski {{was part}} of two other memorable Hardcore TV moments that year. On December 13, he was {{scheduled}} to face Mr. Hughes but the lights unexpectedly went out, and when they came back on again, the entire ECW locker room was engaged in a brawl in the ring. A week later, Slivenski was brought out by Terry Funk as a mock Sabu impersonator and attacked by Funk. When Sabu's then manager Paul E. Dangerously confronted Funk, he was chased <b>off.</b> <b>In</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a sold-out crowd at the ECW Arena, Slivenski scored an upset victory over Pitbull #1 in his ECW debut at Holiday Hell '93 on December 26, 1993. When his opponent continued attacking him after the match, The Sandman came to his rescue. This match aired on ECW Hardcore TV three days later.|$|E

25|$|Armed with batons, PAD forces {{surrounded}} Parliament {{and used}} razor wire barricades {{to prevent the}} legislature from meeting to hear Samak's replacement, Somchai Wongsawat, formally announce his policies. The government decided {{to crack down on}} the protesters. Police used tear gas but many bullets were fired at the protesters. Many protesters got seriously wounded; some even lost legs, causing over a hundred injuries. One additional PAD leader was killed, claimed by the police, when the bomb in his car went <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the headquarters of the Chart Thai Party, a member of the government coalition. Several protesters lost their hands and legs, although it was not clear whether these injuries were caused by tear gas rounds or the ping-pong grenades. Pornthip Rojanasunand, Director of the Central Institute of Forensic Science, claimed that the loss of one particular PAD member's leg could not have been the result of tear gas usage, but came from a more powerful explosion. After viewing photographs of Angkhana Radappanyawut's injuries, Pornthip Rojanasunand suggested unequivocally that the death was caused by the explosion of a tear gas canister. She also stated that there was no need to conduct further investigations into the death and injuries of protesters because it became clear that they were caused by weapons of police. Investigations took place while charges against the police and government were filed by many protesters.|$|E

At the age of 12, Streep was selected to sing at a school recital, leading to her having opera lessons from Estelle Liebling. However, despite her talent, she remarked that [...] "I was singing something I didn't feel and understand. That was an important lesson—not to do that. To find the thing that I could feel through". She quit after four years. Streep had many Catholic school friends, and regularly attended mass.|$|E
