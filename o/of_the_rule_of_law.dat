5|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} principles spring from the basic idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> These may {{be divided into two}} groups: principles that ensure the law is capable of guiding its subjects' behaviour, and principles establishing legal machinery to secure compliance with the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|A thin {{conception}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> {{has generally}} been adopted by the Singapore Government and Members of Parliament from the ruling People's Action Party, as evidenced from the views expressed during a 1999 parliamentary debate on the rule of law. However, a thicker conception was evinced by the Minister for Law in a speech made during the 2009 seasonal meeting of the New York State Bar Association's International Section in Singapore. On the other hand, a thick conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> that encompasses human rights has been adopted {{by a number of}} Government critics, including opposition politicians, and foreign and international organizations such as Human Rights Watch, Lawyers' Rights Watch Canada and the World Justice Project.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, {{ensuring}} {{widespread and}} {{equal access to}} justice for Singapore citizens is a constant goal. In this respect, the judiciary takes effort to ensure that both procedural and substantive elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> are fulfilled – firstly, by continually increasing {{the efficiency of the}} courts and legal processes, and secondly, by regularly improving the skills, knowledge and values of and judges.|$|E

5|$|Another event which {{attracted}} {{much debate}} was the Supreme Court's annulment of the 1946 war crimes conviction of Gregorij Rožman. Rožman was the Catholic bishop of Ljubljana {{who had been}} found guilty of war crimes and treason during World War II {{as a result of}} his collaboration with Italian and German occupation forces. Several attempts during the 1990s to review the trial had failed. This had led to Janša's government changing the law, enabling the religious communities to request a review of trials of their deceased members, something which had previously been reserved only for close relatives. After the Archdiocese of Ljubljana initiated the review, the Supreme Court annulled the 1946 trial on procedural grounds, effectively rehabilitating Rožman, a decision that caused much controversy. This proved harmful for Peterle's campaign, as he was closely associated with the Catholic Church. When asked about the Rožman case in a TV debate, Peterle confined himself to remarking that he was a supporter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> that the war had divided the nation and that Rožman had played some part in that.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{his work}} as a {{barrister}} and judge, Denning was involved in supporting student law societies and other groups; at various times he was Vice-President of Queen's University Belfast Law Society and a patron of the Legal Research Foundation, the United Law Clerks' Society and the Commonwealth Legal Education Association. He also spent time as the Vice-President of the Society of Genealogists, Honorary President of the Council for the Protection of Rural England and Honorary President of the Glasgow University Dialectic Society. From 1950 he acted as an administrator and fund-raiser for Cumberland Lodge. After being made aware of the Le Court charity for invalid ex-servicemen by Geoffrey Cheshire Denning became the chairman of the organisation in 1952. In 1953 he was elected President of Birkbeck College, University of London and on 18 March presented the 1952 Haldane Memorial Lecture on the subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and the welfare state. In 1964 he was made President of the English Association in recognition of his contributions to English prose. He became Chairman of the Historical Manuscripts Commission in 1962, resigning in December 1982.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of the key}} {{principles}} {{associated with}} the thin conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> include judicial independence, natural justice, the availability of judicial review, and the accessibility of justice. Judicial independence in Singapore is safeguarded by various constitutional provisions and legal rules, though some commentators have highlighted certain events as suggesting a lack of judicial independence. One incident in the 1980s involving {{the transfer of the}} Senior District Judge to the Attorney-General's Chambers following a decision he made which was favourable to an opposition politician was investigated by a commission of inquiry and found not to be due to executive interference. In Singapore, natural justice is generally regarded as a procedural rather than a substantive concept. The process of judicial review involves the review of executive actions for compliance with administrative law rules, and of executive and legislative acts for unconstitutionality in light of the doctrine of constitutional supremacy. The state of the courts and legal processes in Singapore are largely seen as making justice accessible for the citizenry.|$|E

25|$|A {{corollary}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> is {{the existence}} of a legal profession sufficiently autonomous to invoke the authority of the independent judiciary; the right to assistance of a barrister in a court proceeding emanates from this corollary—in England the function of barrister or advocate is distinguished from legal counselor. As the European Court of Human Rights has stated, the law should be adequately accessible to everyone and people should be able to foresee how the law affects them.|$|E
