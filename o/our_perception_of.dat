25|$|Current {{research}} in sensory processing is divided among a biophysical modelling of different subsystems {{and a more}} theoretical modelling of perception. Current models of perception {{have suggested that the}} brain performs some form of Bayesian inference and integration of different sensory information in generating <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the physical world.|$|E
25|$|As an example, {{suppose that}} {{light in the}} orange range of {{wavelengths}} (approximately 577nm to 597nm) enters the eye and strikes the retina. Light of these wavelengths would activate both the medium and long wavelength cones of the retina, but not equally—the long-wavelength cells will respond more. The difference in the response can be detected by the brain, and this difference {{is the basis of}} <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> orange. Thus, the orange appearance of an object results from light from the object entering our eye and stimulating the different cones simultaneously but to different degrees.|$|E
25|$|Although the A-weighting curve, in {{widespread}} use for noise measurement, {{is said to}} have been based on the 40-phon Fletcher-Munson curve, research in the 1960s demonstrated that determinations of equal-loudness made using pure tones are not directly relevant to <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> noise. This is because the cochlea in our inner ear analyses sounds in terms of spectral content, each 'hair-cell' responding to a narrow band of frequencies known as a critical band. The high-frequency bands are wider in absolute terms than the low frequency bands, and therefore 'collect' proportionately more power from a noise source. However, when more than one critical band is stimulated, the outputs of the various bands are summed by the brain to produce an impression of loudness. For these reasons equal-loudness curves derived using noise bands show an upwards tilt above 1kHz and a downward tilt below 1kHz when compared to the curves derived using pure tones.|$|E

Sullivan claims that [...] "significant others", persons with the most power to reward and punish individual behavior, were primarily responsible for determining behavior. Interpersonal theorists argue that [...] "behavioral patterns {{are determined by the}} characteristics of the situation, how the person perceives them, and his behavioral dispositions at the time." [...] The most important component of personality is self-esteem. Blassingame explains, [...] "Our sense of self-esteem is heightened or lowered by <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the images others have of us." [...] Interpersonal behavior revolves around the dominant-submissive axes: [...] "One form of behavior tends to elicit its complement: dominance leads to submission and vice versa. The extent of submissiveness often depends on the structure of the group to which the person belongs." ...|$|E

500|$|In early 2003, Nolan {{approached}} Warner Bros. {{with the}} idea {{to make a new}} Batman film. Fascinated by the character and story, he wanted to make a film grounded in a [...] "relatable" [...] world more reminiscent of a classical drama than a comic-book fantasy. Batman Begins, the biggest project Nolan had undertaken to that point, premiered in June 2005 to both critical acclaim and commercial success. Starring Christian Bale in the title role, along with Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson, the film revived the franchise, heralding a trend towards darker films which rebooted (or retold) backstories. It tells the origin story of the character from Bruce Wayne's initial fear of bats, the death of his parents, his journey to become Batman, and his fight against Ra's al Ghul's plot to destroy Gotham City. Praised for its psychological depth and contemporary relevance, Kyle Smith of The New York Post called it [...] "a wake-up call to the people who keep giving us cute capers about men in tights. It wipes the smirk {{off the face of the}} superhero movie." [...] Batman Begins was the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2005 in the United States and the year's ninth-highest-grossing film worldwide. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography and three BAFTA awards. On the film's 10th anniversary, Forbes published an article describing its influence: [...] "Reboot became part of our modern vocabulary, and superhero origin stories became increasingly en vogue for the genre. The phrase [...] "dark and gritty" [...] likewise joined the cinematic lexicon, influencing <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> different approaches to storytelling not only in the comic book film genre but in all sorts of other genres as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|Conversely, some {{research}} has revealed that, rather than music affecting <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> speech, our native speech can affect <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> music.

The tritone paradox is where a listener is presented with two computer-generated tones (such as C and F-Sharp) that are half an octave (or a tritone) apart and are then asked {{to determine whether the}} pitch of the sequence is descending or ascending. One such study, performed by Ms. Diana Deutsch, found that the listener's interpretation of ascending or descending pitch was influenced by the listener's language or dialect, showing variation between those raised in the south of England and those in California or from those in Vietnam and those in California whose native language was English. A second study, performed in 2006 on a group of English speakers and 3 groups of East Asian students at University of Southern California, discovered that English speakers who had begun musical training at or before age 5 had an 8% chance of having perfect pitch.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Byrne & Hilbert (B&H) {{argue that}} colors are {{reflectance}} prop-erties of objects. They also {{claim that a}} necessary condition for something’s being a color is that it causally explain – or be causally implicated in the explanation <b>of</b> – <b>our</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> color. I argue that these two positions are in conflict. Byrne & Hilbert (2003; henceforth B&H) argue for reflectance physicalism, the view that colors are reflectance properties of ob-jects. A necessary condition for something’s being a color, in their opinion, is that it should causally explain – or be causally impli-cated in the explanation <b>of</b> – <b>our</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> color. 1 Their view is that “[a]ny plausible version of physicalism will identify the col-ors with physical properties implicated in the causal process that underlies the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> color ” (sect. 3. 1).
