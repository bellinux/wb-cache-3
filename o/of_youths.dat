50|$|The {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>youth</b> {{culture is}} a relatively recent historical phenomenon.

One historical theory credits the emergence <b>of</b> <b>youth</b> culture {{to the beginning of}} compulsory schooling. James Coleman argues that age segregation is the root <b>of</b> a separate <b>youth</b> culture. Before compulsory schooling, many children and adolescents interacted primarily with adults. In contrast, modern children associate extensively with others their own age.
