6000|$|He leaned <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> {{her behind}} the drawn curtains. [...] "I will, Alice! I will indeed! I won't keep {{anything}} from you after this." ...|$|E
60|$|She did not answer, {{but looked}} up at him, innocently and confidingly. He bent <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her, and gave her hand a little squeeze.|$|E
60|$|Leslie's {{lips were}} {{trembling}} and her whole form was tense with emotion. But Anne laughed heartlessly. She bent <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> Leslie's upturned reproachful face.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, {{she could}} not resist bending <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissing</b> the sleeper, so gently {{that there was no}} movement. Then she left the room, and Susan stood with clasped hands.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Ben {{makes his}} way to a lonely bus, {{planning}} to skip the city with Indigo. While there, he impulsively reaches <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kisses</b> her, hoping all his questions might finally be answered. But thereâ€™s nothing.|$|R
6000|$|The lady {{held out}} her hand, which Harry, instead of bending <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissing,</b> as she had expected, shook heartily. For an instant only a look of intense {{surprise}} passed across her face; then she said courteously: ...|$|R
6000|$|Henrietta leant <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her forehead. 'Say {{what you}} like, dearest Miss Grandison; {{you speak to}} a friend, who loves you, and will respect your secret.' ...|$|E
6000|$|All Norman's {{love and}} {{strength}} combined for his task. As he leant <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> his young wife there was real fervour {{in his voice}} as he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Borne stooped <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her, {{and went}} to the door. He came back and asked, [...] "You don't think it was silly, or anything, for me to get it?" ...|$|E
60|$|She leant <b>over</b> me <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> my {{forehead}} with {{a burst of}} genuine delight.|$|R
60|$|She glanced round. There {{was no sign}} of the {{returning}} waiter. She bent <b>over</b> him <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} are right, dear," [...] Mrs. Withers said, rising from her seat <b>and</b> going <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissing</b> her husband tenderly. [...] "I had not thought of it in that light at all. In fact I had hardly thought about it at all, except {{that it would be}} nice to see Mabel {{provided}} for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother, I am {{engaged to}} Hugh," [...] Maude said, and bent <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her. Ezra and I stood gazing at them. Then {{he turned to}} me and pressed my hand.|$|E
60|$|Swithin entered quietly, {{and looked}} round the room. Seeing with {{unexpected}} pleasure {{that she was}} there alone, he came <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her. Her discomposure at some foregone event was soon obvious.|$|E
60|$|That quite won me, Mina, {{for it was}} {{brave and}} sweet of him, and noble too, to a rival, wasn't it? And he so sad, so I leant <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> him.|$|E
60|$|Alick's {{response}} was to bend <b>over</b> her, <b>and</b> <b>kiss</b> her brow. She {{had never seen him}} so much gratified.|$|R
60|$|Bill {{stirred in}} his sleep and muttered. Ruth bent <b>over</b> him <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> the honourable scratch on his cheek.|$|R
60|$|As {{she made}} her promise she turned her sweet face up to his, <b>and</b> he leaned <b>over</b> her, <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|Carey, much moved, went <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> {{both her}} boy's champions, while Ellen said, {{with tears in}} her eyes, [...] "Oh, Johnny, I'm glad you were at least not so bad. What ended it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have my answer, sir!" [...] His strong {{face looked}} gravely sweet. He only said one word as {{he laid his}} hand on our clasped ones, whilst he bent <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> his daughter: ...|$|E
60|$|So Miriam {{began and}} told him all her tale, while he listened patiently. When she had done he rose and, limping round the little table, bent <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her solemnly upon the brow.|$|E
60|$|He bent <b>over</b> her <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> {{her golden}} hair, each blue-veined lid closed in unconsciousness, the perfect lips pallid now and still.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a step}} in the conservatory, {{and before}} she could turn round, her brother Maurice bent <b>over</b> her, <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her.|$|R
60|$|Pierre glances slowly {{all round}} him; every thing {{seems to be}} right; he looks up with a grateful, melancholy {{satisfaction}} at Isabel; a tear gathers in her eye; but she conceals it from him by coming very close to him, stooping <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissing</b> his brow. 'Tis her lips that leave the warm moisture there; not her tears, she says.|$|R
60|$|Stephanie rose {{slowly to}} her feet, leaned {{gracefully}} <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her hostess on both cheeks, and submitted {{her hand to}} the Prince, who raised it to his lips. Then she turned to Dominey.|$|E
6000|$|... "But it is true--and I {{can easily}} prove it, father," [...] {{answered}} the youth, in a happy tone. He bent <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> his parent. [...] "Oh, I am so glad I have found you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{company had}} risen to its feet; Daisy, still showing her pretty teeth, bent <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her hostess. [...] "Mrs. Walker, you are too perfect," [...] she said. [...] "I'm not going alone; I am {{going to meet a}} friend." ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} bright with triumph. She leaned <b>over</b> him <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> {{him on the}} lips. Then she sprang lightly to her feet.|$|R
60|$|Again {{he tried}} to pull it away, but the strange man held it tighter. Still further, he bent his head <b>over</b> it <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> it.|$|R
60|$|He bent <b>over</b> her <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her, <b>and</b> it is {{said that}} Asmund wept in that hour, for after his fashion he loved his wife.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless her heart!" [...] {{cried the}} major fervently; and the {{battered}} old Bohemian, as he stooped <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her, felt a tear spring {{to his eyes}} as he knew that he had come into harbour after life's stormy tossings.|$|E
60|$|His hand rested for {{a moment}} upon her shoulder. He drew her a little towards him. She {{suddenly}} laughed, leaned <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> him on both cheeks, and jumped up. The trim little parlourmaid was {{at the door with}} tea.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time in his life he bent <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her upon the lips. She {{suffered}} his caress not only without resistance but for a single moment her arms clasped his neck passionately. Then she drew away abruptly.|$|E
6000|$|Stockdale bent <b>over</b> her <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her, <b>and</b> she involuntarily {{returned}} his kiss. 'I shall go early,' he said hurriedly. 'I shall not see you again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good night,' <b>and</b> {{he leaned}} <b>over</b> her <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her forehead, in a grave {{grateful}} way {{that brought the}} tears into her eyes as he silently departed.|$|R
60|$|Her eyes {{laughed at}} me. There was {{something}} softly provocative in them--a new and kinder light. I bent <b>over</b> her <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her. She sat quite still.|$|R
