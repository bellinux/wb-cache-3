50|$|The genetic {{structure}} of Bunyamwera virus is typical for Bunyaviridae viruses, {{which are a}} family of enveloped negative-sense single stranded RNA viruses with a genome split into three parts—Small (S), Middle (M) and Large (L). The L RNA segment encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein), the M RNA segment encodes two surface glycoproteins (Gc and Gn) and a nonstructural protein (NSm), while the S RNA segment encodes a nucleocapsid protein (N) and, in an alternative <b>overlapping</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame,</b> a second nonstructural protein (NSs). The genomic RNA segments are encapsidated by copies of the N protein {{in the form of}} ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. The N protein is the most abundant protein in virus particles and infected cells and, therefore, the main target in many serological and molecular diagnostics.|$|E

Through the use of antisynthetic peptide antibodies, we show that both proteins are expressed in virally infected cells.

40|$|Coding of {{multiple}} proteins by <b>overlapping</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> {{is not a}} feature one would associate with eukaryotic genes. Indeed, codependency between codons of overlapping protein-coding regions imposes {{a unique set of}} evolutionary constraints, making it a costly arrangement. Yet in cases of tightly coexpressed interacting proteins, dual coding may be advantageous. Here we show that although dual coding is nearly impossible by chance, a number of human transcripts contain overlapping coding regions. Using newly developed statistical techniques, we identified 40 candidate genes with evolutionarily conserved overlapping coding regions. Because our approach is conservative, we expect mammals to possess more dual-coding genes. Our results emphasize that the skepticism surrounding eukaryotic dual coding is unwarranted: rather than being artifacts, <b>overlapping</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> are often hallmarks of fascinating biology...|$|R

40|$|MOTIVATION: Viral genomes tend to code in <b>overlapping</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> to {{maximize}} informational content. This {{may result in}} atypical codon bias and particular evolutionary constraints. Due to the fast mutation rate of viruses, there is additional strong evidence for varying selection between intra- and intergenomic regions. The presence of multiple coding regions complicates the concept of K(a) /K(s) ratio, and thus begs for an alternative approach when investigating selection strengths. Building on the paper by McCauley and Hein, we develop a method for annotating a viral genome coding in <b>overlapping</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> We introduce an evolutionary model capable of accounting for varying levels of selection along the genome, and incorporate it into our prior single sequence HMM methodology, extending it now to a phylogenetic HMM. Given an alignment of several homologous viruses to a reference sequence, we may thus achieve an annotation both of coding regions as well as selection strengths, allowing us to investigate different selection patterns and hypotheses. RESULTS: We illustrate our method by applying it to a multiple alignment of four HIV 2 sequences, {{as well as of}} three Hepatitis B sequences. We obtain an annotation of the coding regions, as well as a posterior probability for each site of the strength of selection acting on it. From this we may deduce the average posterior selection acting on the different genes. Whilst we are encouraged to see in HIV 2, that the known to be conserved genes gag and pol are indeed annotated as such, we also discover several sites of less stringent negative selection within the env gene. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to subsequently provide a full selection annotation of the Hepatitis B genome by explicitly modelling the evolution within <b>overlapping</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames,</b> and not relying on simple K(a) /K(s) ratios...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Overlapping genes (encoded on {{the same}} DNA strand but in {{different}} frames) {{are thought to be}} rare and, therefore, were largely neglected in the past. In a test set of 800 viruses we found more than 350 potential <b>overlapping</b> open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> of> 500 bp which generate BLAST hits, indicating a possible biological function. Interestingly, five overlaps with more than 2000 bp were found, the largest may even contain triple overlaps. In order to perform the vast amount of BLAST searches required to test all detected open <b>reading</b> <b>frames,</b> we compared two clustering strategies (BLASTCLUST and k-means) and queried the database with one representative only.

Not only are they encoded by the same locus, but a specific XLalphas/ALEX interaction is essential for G-protein signaling in neuroendocrine cells. A disruption of this interaction leads to abnormal human phenotypes, including mental retardation and growth deficiency. The region of overlap between the two <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> evolves at a remarkable speed: the divergence between human and mouse ALEX polypeptides makes them virtually unalignable. To trace the evolution of this puzzling locus, we sequenced it in apes, Old World monkeys, and a New World monkey. We show that the overlap between the two <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> and the physical interaction between the two proteins force the locus to evolve in an unprecedented way. Namely, to maintain two overlapping protein-coding regions the locus is forced to have high GC content, which significantly elevates its intrinsic evolutionary rate. However, the two encoded proteins cannot afford to change too quickly relative {{to each other as}} this may impair their interaction and lead to severe physiological consequences. As a result XLalphas and ALEX evolve in an oscillating fashion constantly balancing the rates of amino acid replacements.

Clones corresponding to the measles virus haemagglutinin (HA) gene were isolated and one, PCD-HA- 15, which corresponded to the complete mRNA sequence, was further characterized. After transfection into COS- 7 cells, measles virus HA antigen was detected by immunofluorescence. The [35 S]methionine-labelled HA protein from transfected cells was immunoprecipitated by both polyclonal and monoclonal measles virus antibodies.

Antisense oligonucleotides annealed appropriately 3 ' of a slippery sequence have also shown activity in frameshifting, at least in vitro.

We propose that the shorter spacer increases the tension on the mRNA such that when the tRNA detaches, it more readily enters the - 2 frame on the U 6 A heptamer.

By cloning recT with a plasmid vector compatible with pBR 322, we showed by cis-trans tests that the portion of the recE gene encoding ExoVIII DNA nuclease activity is also required for RecE pathway conjugational recombination. The recT gene can replace the redB gene of lambda for recA-independent plasmid recombination.

Bunyamwera virus is the prototype of both the Bunyavirus genus and the family Bunyaviridae and was isolated from infected mosquitoes in Uganda (Smithburn et al., 1946).

To search for a polypeptide product derived from BM 2 ORF, a genetically engineered beta-galactosidase-BM 2 ORF fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and a polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised to the purified fusion protein. This antiserum was used to identify a polypeptide, designated BM 2 protein (Mr approximately equal to 12, 000), that is synthesized in influenza B virus-infected cells. To understand the mechanism by which the BM 2 protein is generated from influenza B virus RNA segment 7, a mutational analysis of the cloned DNA was performed and the altered DNAs were expressed in eukaryotic cells. The expression patterns of the M 1 and BM 2 proteins from the altered DNAs indicate that the BM 2 protein initiation codon overlaps with the termination codon of the M 1 protein in an overlapping translational stop-start pentanucleotide, TAATG, and that the expression of the BM 2 protein requires 5 '-adjacent termination of M 1 synthesis.

The bipartite genome of begomoviruses prevalent in the New World and their counterparts in the Old World share a high degree of genome homology except for a partially <b>overlapping</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> encoding the pre-coat protein (PCP, or AV 2). PCP contributes to the essential functions of intercellular movement and suppression of host RNA silencing, but it is only present in the Old World viruses. In this study, we analyzed a set of non-redundant bipartite begomovirus genomes originating from the Old World (N = 28) and the New World (N = 65). Our bioinformatic analysis suggests ∼ 120 nucleotides were deleted from PCP's proximal promoter region that may have contributed to its loss in the New World viruses. Consequently, genomes of the New World viruses are smaller than the Old World counterparts, possibly compensating for the loss of the intercellular movement functions of PCP. Additionally, we detected substantial purifying selection on a portion of the New World DNA-B movement protein (MP, or BC 1). Further analysis of the New World MP gene revealed the emergence of a putative tyrosine phosphorylation site, which likely explains the increased purifying selection in that region.

40|$|The triplet-based {{genetic code}} {{requires}} that translating ribosomes maintain the reading frame of a messenger RNA faithfully to ensure correct protein synthesis. However, in programmed - 1 ribosomal frameshifting, a specific subversion of frame maintenance takes place, wherein the ribosome {{is forced to}} shift one nucleotide backwards into an <b>overlapping</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> and to translate an entirely new sequence of amino acids. This process is indispensable in the replication of numerous viral pathogens, including HIV and the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome, and is also exploited in the expression of several cellular genes. Frameshifting is promoted by an mRNA signal composed of two essential elements: a heptanucleotide 'slippery' sequence and an adjacent mRNA secondary structure, most often an mRNA pseudoknot. How these components operate together to manipulate the ribosome is unknown. Here we describe the observation of a ribosome-mRNA pseudoknot complex that is stalled {{in the process of}} - 1 frameshifting. Cryoelectron microscopic imaging of purified mammalian 80 S ribosomes from rabbit reticulocytes paused at a coronavirus pseudoknot reveals an intermediate of the frameshifting process. From this it can be seen how the pseudoknot interacts with the ribosome to block the mRNA entrance channel, compromising the translocation process and leading to a spring-like deformation of the P-site transfer RNA. In addition, we identify movements of the likely eukaryotic ribosomal helicase and confirm a direct interaction between the translocase eEF 2 and the P-site tRNA.

40|$|Overlapping genes {{exist in}} all domains {{of life and}} are much more {{abundant}} than expected at their first discovery in the late 1970 s. Assuming that the reference gene is read in frame + 0, an overlapping gene can be encoded in two reading frames in the sense strand, denoted by + 1 and + 2, and in three reading frames in the opposite strand, denoted by - 0, - 1 and - 2. This motivated numerous researchers to study the constraints induced by the genetic code on the various overlapping frames, mostly based on information theory. Our focus in this paper is on the constraints induced on two overlapping genes in terms of amino acids, as well as polypeptides. We show that simple linear constraints bind the amino acid composition of two proteins encoded by overlapping genes. Novel constraints are revealed when polypeptides are considered, and not just single amino acids. For example, in double-coding sequences with an <b>overlapping</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> - 2, each Tyrosine (denoted as Tyr or Y) in the overlapping frame overlaps a Tyrosine in the reference frame + 0 (and reciprocally), whereas specific words (e. g. YY) never occur. We thus distinguish between null constraints (YY = 0 in frame - 2) and non-null constraints (Y in frame + 0 Y in frame - 2). Our equivalence-based constraints are symmetrical and thus enable the characterization of the joint composition of overlapping proteins. We describe several formal frameworks and a graph algorithm to characterize and compute these constraints. These results yield support for understanding the mechanisms and evolution of overlapping genes, and for developing novel overlapping gene detection methods...|$|E
40|$|A large Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) B 95 - 8 {{genomic bank}} has been {{prepared}} in an Escherichia coli expression vector and screened {{with a pool}} of sera from human infectious mononucleosis patients. Four immunopositive clones which also contained sequences from the viral large internal repeat were selected. DNA sequence analysis has located them on the repeat sequence and shown that they come from three potential open <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> and that two of them consist of <b>overlapping</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> This must imply extensive intron/exon splicing or that the repeat itself encodes several different proteins. The four expressed epitopes were shown to be present simultaneously in independent cases of infectious mononucleosis. These have not been previously described {{and based on the}} experimental design, they must reflect the situation in vivo...|$|R
40|$|How, {{and to what}} extent, {{does the}} {{environment}} influence the way mutations interact? Do environmental changes affect both the sign and the magnitude of epistasis? Are there any correlations between environments in the variability, sign or magnitude of epistasis? Very few studies have tackled these questions. Here, we addressed them {{in the context of}} viral emergence. Most emerging viruses are RNA viruses with small genomes, <b>overlapping</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> and multifunctional proteins for which epistasis is abundant. Understanding the effect of host species in the sign and magnitude of epistasis will provide insights into the evolutionary ecology of infectious diseases and the predictability of viral emergence.

40|$|The {{polycistronic}} P/C mRNA of Sendai {{virus is}} translated under cell-free conditions into five proteins (P, C', C, Y 1, and Y 2) from <b>overlapping</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames.</b> In this study, {{we showed that}} in addition to the P, C', and C proteins, Y 1 and Y 2 were expressed by six different Sendai virus strains in infected cells. The Y proteins exhibited strain-specific variation in their gel mobility which corresponds to the variation seen in the cognate C proteins. While the relative levels of the P, C', and C proteins were consistent among various cell lines, the levels of Y 1 and Y 2 proteins varied among the cell lines used for viral infection...|$|R
