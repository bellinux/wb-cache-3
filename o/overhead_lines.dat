5|$|On 23 September 2009 an {{overhead}} power line dropped on to a Class 373 train arriving at St Pancras station, activating a circuit breaker and delaying eleven other trains. Two days later, on 25 September 2009, electrical power via the <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> was lost on a section of high-speed line outside Lille, delaying passengers on two evening Eurostar-operated services.|$|E
5|$|Though Line A ran on a {{different}} voltage {{to the rest of}} the network, it was converted to the 1500v used on the rest of the network when the 200 Series trains began to arrive. On the other hand, Line B has traditionally been the most troublesome of the network given its different voltage and the fact that it uses third rail electrification as opposed to the <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> used on the rest of the network, making it in effect a separate entity not capable of sharing its stock with other lines. Presently this line uses 1960's rolling stock acquired from Tokyo's Eidan Marunouchi Line, along with CAF 5000 and CAF 6000 stock acquired from Madrid which are to replace the aging Eidan stock. The line, along with its remaining third rail stock, is being converted to <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> at 1500v, after which the entire network will be standardised.|$|E
5|$|At present, all Singapore lines {{run with}} fixed length trains {{between three and}} six cars, with the future Thomson-East Coast Line using four cars. Since the system's {{conception}} in 1987, all train lines have been powered by the 750 volt DC third rail, {{with the exception of}} the North East Line which is powered by 1500 volt DC <b>overhead</b> <b>lines.</b> The North South and East West lines uses an automatic train operation system that is similar to London Underground's Victoria line.|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} heavy compound <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> for the Shinkansen {{is limited}} to travel at roughly 240 km/h and even for a running test, in order to drive at 360 km/h improvements to the <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> equipment are essential. In the current running test there was a limited {{period of one year}} from when the test was scheduled to when it was started. As the <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> over a large area needed to be improved, development of a new method of construction enabling shortening of the construction period and in addition providing resolution to the issue 1) found during testing using a business car conducted in 2003 was implemented. As is well known for targeting increase in speed, increase in the wave propagation velocity c of <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> given by Eq. (1) is effective; therefore, high tension and weight reduction of the contact wire used to handle the increase in speed. C = (T /?) * 3. 6 [km / h] [...] . (1) Here T is tensile force (N) and? is weight per unit length (kg/m) The <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> used for high speed sections of our Shinkansen are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1. In Table 1, the “Tension-increased <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> ” is the <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> improved for increasing speed to 275 km/h in conjunction with introducing E 2 and E 3 series to the Tohoku Shinkansen and the “CS compound <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> ” is the <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> improved for the running test for the test train car “STAR 21 ” that reached a maximum speed of 425 km/h on the Joetsu Shinkansen...|$|R
5|$|Other works {{being carried}} out during this period include the {{improvement}} of disabled access in older stations, new ventilation systems on lines B, C and D, improvements in electrification (such as replacing <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> and substations) on lines A, B, C and D and the replacement of 14km of track on Lines C and E. The total investment in this period for these new projects has been set at US$1.34 billion.|$|E
5|$|The trams are {{electrically}} powered from 750 V DC <b>overhead</b> <b>lines.</b> Between 1992 and 2007, electricity for the Metrolink system was procured by the operator, based on price only. In 2007, GMPTE changed the contractual requirements {{to ensure that}} sustainable power would be factored into choosing an energy supplier, and in July 2007, Metrolink became the first light rail network in the UK with electricity supplied entirely from sustainable energy via hydropower. Now, energy for the system is generated by biomass.|$|E
5|$|From 1913 former S {{lines were}} {{electrified}} with 1,500Vdc <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> and electric locomotives hauled coal trains between Shildon and Erimus marshalling yard, which had opened in 1908 between Middlesbrough and Thornaby. The trains took the former S line from Shildon to Simpasture Junction, joining the former Clarence Railway line to Carlton, where a later line allowed {{access to the}} Stockton to Middlesbrough extension. The locomotives operated for 20 years, but then coal traffic had reduced, which made it uneconomical to maintain the electrification system.|$|E
50|$|It {{is quite}} likely that <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> {{crossings}} of broad waters {{can be replaced}} with underwater cables. The <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> crossing the Strait of Messina — which, with a span of 3646 meters, {{was one of the}} longest <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> crossings in the world, with 200-meter pylons {{among the highest in the}} world — was replaced by a submarine cable, because of its small maximum transmittable electrical power.|$|R

50|$|Two {{well-known}} wide river crossings are the Elbe Crossing 1 and Elbe Crossing 2. The latter has {{the tallest}} <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> masts in Europe, at 227 m tall. In Spain, the <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> crossing pylons in the Spanish bay of Cádiz have a particularly interesting construction. The main crossing towers are 158 m tall with one crossarm atop a frustum framework construction. The longest <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> spans are the {{crossing of the}} Norwegian Sognefjord (4597 m between two masts) and the Ameralik Span in Greenland (5376 m). In Germany, the <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> of the EnBW AG crossing of the Eyachtal has the longest span {{in the country at}} 1444 m.|$|R
5|$|Nazi {{occupation}} {{ended on}} 30 August 1944 and Liberation slowly healed the town's wounds. It {{had been a}} catastrophe for the network: of the 76 trams in circulation in 1939, 24 had been destroyed and 25 damaged; track and <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> had been mutilated; the Trianon depot had been bombed several times Still, service was slowly restored, thanks to the staff's hard work and above all passengers' help in shunting trailing cars. In 1945, 38 locomotives and 14 trailing cars were operational, but, despite restoration of service across the Seine on 20 April 1946, the war had struck a fatal blow. Rouen was full of out-of-date equipment and so trams were progressively replaced by buses and trolleybuses.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of the great {{depression}} until the closure of the network only one lot of trams was purchased by the MTT. Due to shortages there was minimal maintenance of the network during World War II and post-war shortages prevented the purchase of new trams. In 1951–1952 the MTT lost £313,320 and made the decision to convert the Erindale, Burnside and Linden Park lines to electric trolleybuses. The last trams on these lines ran on 24 May 1952 with the lines lifted from 18 April 1953. A 1953 royal commission was held to inquire into the financial affairs of the MTT resulting in a completely reconstituted board. Late the same year, with driver safety concerns about the conflict with increasing traffic on the road, the Glen Osmond line was temporarily converted to motor buses. The line was never converted back to trams and much comment was made about the continuing maintenance of unused <b>overhead</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Caltrans {{released}} the first feasibility study detailing {{the possibility of}} electrifying the railroad between San Francisco and San Jose. The 1992 Feasibility Study proposed replacing the existing diesel-electric locomotives with either a fleet of EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives to move the existing gallery passenger cars or Metro North Budd M-2/M-4 EMUs. The primary benefits of an electrified railway would be improvements in air quality, noise, and acceleration, but would also save on other ancillary costs, such as lubricating oil, cooling water, maintenance, and refueling. Because of the relatively close spacing between stops, the improved acceleration using electric locomotives compared to the existing diesel-electric locomotives would cut transit time between San Francisco and San Jose by up to twelve minutes, and using EMUs would cut the time over the same distance by up to 23 minutes, assuming the use of ten-car trainsets. The 1992 Feasibility Study recommended the use of electric locomotives and 25kV AC <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> as the most cost-effective alternative, since the gallery cars, which had been built in 1985, were then relatively new and could be reused.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} report describes a holistic {{view of the}} impacts that ESKOM Distribution is currently facing due to poor quality <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> fittings supplied by local and international manufacturers. <b>Overhead</b> <b>line</b> fittings are components/hardware used to connect power lines {{to function as a}} network.

25|$|Railway {{electrification}} in Great Britain began {{during the}} late 19th century. A range of voltages has been used, employing both <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> and conductor rails; the two most common systems are 25 kV AC using <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> and the 750VDC third rail system used in southeast England and on Merseyrail. In 2006, 40%— of the British rail network was electrified, and 60% of all rail journeys were by electric traction (both by locomotives and multiple units).|$|E

25|$|Lines 2 and 3 use <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> {{to supply}} the {{electric}} current to the train and are electrified at 1500 V DC. Line 1, electrified at 750 V DC, uses a fourth rail system, although the same line also supports <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> in some stretches and depots; this allows Line 2 and 3 trains to use Line 1 tracks to reach a depot placed on the line. Line 5 trains are supplied by a third rail system at 750 V DC, and the same system will be used on the future line 4.|$|E
