The Cardinal has seen an adaptation, Red Snake, and a production in London in April 2017. 'The Glories of <b>Our</b> <b>Blood</b> and State' (also known under the later title 'The Glories of Our Birth and State') from The Contention of Ajax and Ulysses was often set to music, and {{played at the}} coronation of George IV in 1821.|$|E

25|$|My beloved children, I do {{not know}} what you await to shake off the heavy yoke and {{laborious}} servitude in which the subjugation of the Spanish has placed you. I have traveled through all of the province and have inspected all of the villages and, considering carefully the usefulness the Spanish subjugation has brought to us, I have not found a single thing but painful and inexorable servitude.... The demand for tribute is not appeased by the poverty that locks up our comrades as in a jail, nor is the thirst for <b>our</b> <b>blood</b> satisfied by the continuous whippings that bite and tear our bodies to pieces.|$|E
500|$|Babe threatens Abi {{and burns}} {{her as a}} way of keeping her in the clear. Deen {{included}} the scene where Babe deliberately burns Abi in her list of [...] "12 times soaps were scarier than any horror movie". She described the moment as [...] "chilling", writing, [...] "The fact that the grim moment isn't seen (you just hear Abi's anguished scream) makes it even more terrifying." [...] In a separate article, Deen also praised the scene where Babe forced her way into Abi's house and said, [...] "the way she says 'watch your back' makes <b>our</b> <b>blood</b> run cold." [...] In 2017, Lindsay opined that Babe should receive her comeuppance and that Abi [...] "needs to be instrumental" [...] in this.|$|E
500|$|The {{blood bank}} at SMC called for blood donations, while the U.S. missionary {{hospital}} {{announced that it}} will be treating those injured for free. An eyewitness at the hospital said: [...] "Lots of people are standing at the gates of the hospital. The police have closed the area so that no people can get in or out– some tried to get out and were shot at by police." [...] The SMC was seen as a safe place for the opposition protesters to go. By late afternoon, about 4,000 protesters had congregated at the hospital, while protesters who had gathered in the car parks near the emergency entrance chanted: [...] "Down with the regime, with <b>our</b> <b>blood</b> we will defend our rights." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 18, Coandă {{issued a}} [...] "Pledge" [...] (Angajament), which {{regulated}} {{the status of}} Corps soldiers {{in relation to the}} Romanian Army, and which the recruits had to sign. It integrated the former Austro-Hungarian officers into the Romanian Army, with equivalent ranks, and equated their Austrian service, including time they spent in the POW camps, with active duty under Romanian banners. The pledge ended with the words: [...] "May God help us, so that through <b>our</b> <b>blood</b> we may liberate our lands and create a Greater Romania, unified in substance and everlasting." [...] All those who backed out after signing the document were to be considered deserters. Demand for enlistment remained considerable, even though rumor spread that Austro-Hungarian repression forces were by then murdering the families of volunteers and confiscating their property. However, Corps veteran Petru Nemoianu (Nemoian) was later to state that envy and class conflict were also characteristic for the formation, where the intellectual leaders quarreled over the better paid assignments.|$|E
500|$|While U.S. allies such as Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, Israel, and the Northern Alliance {{supported}} the attacks, they were opposed by Cuba and Russia, {{as well as}} the targeted nations and other Muslim countries. The Taliban denounced the operation, denied charges it provided a safe haven for bin Laden, and insisted the U.S. attack killed only innocent civilians. Omar condemned the strikes and announced that Afghanistan [...] "will never hand over bin Laden to anyone and (will) protect him with <b>our</b> <b>blood</b> at all costs." [...] A mob in Jalalabad burned and looted the local UN office, while an Italian UN official was killed in Kabul on August 21, allegedly in response to the strikes. Thousands of anti-U.S. protesters took to the streets of Khartoum. Al-Bashir led an anti-U.S. rally and warned of possible reciprocation, and Martha Crenshaw notes that the strike [...] "gained the regime some sympathy in the Arab world." [...] The Sudanese government expelled the British ambassador for Britain's support of the attacks, while protesters stormed the empty U.S. embassy. Sudan also reportedly allowed two suspected accomplices to the embassy bombings to escape. Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi declared his country's support for Sudan and led an anti-U.S. rally in Tripoli. Zawahiri later equated the destruction of Al-Shifa with the September 11 attacks.|$|E

2500|$|Shirley's Poems (1646) {{contained}} the epyllion Narcissus and the masque The Triumph of Beauty. A Contention for Honour and Riches (1633) appeared in an altered and enlarged form in 1659 as Honoria and Mammon. His Contention of Ajax and Ulysses closes with the well-known lyric [...] "The Glories of <b>our</b> <b>Blood</b> and State." [...] In the final pedagogic {{stage of his}} career, Shirley published an English grammar written in poetry, titled Rudiments of Grammar: The Rules Composed in English Verse for the Greater Benefit and Delight of Young Beginners (1656).|$|E
2500|$|Arya is not {{the only}} {{character}} to change her name or have her name changed for her. Her sister Sansa Stark assumes the identity of Alayne Stone. Tyrion Lannister travels under the names Yollo and Hugor Hill. Catelyn Stark becomes Lady Stoneheart. And Theon Greyjoy's chapters in A Dance with Dragons are titled: Reek, The Prince of Winterfell, The Turncloak, A Ghost in Winterfell, and finally, Theon again. Martin says: [...] "Identity {{is one of the things}} that I'm playing with in this series as a whole, and in this particular book — what is it that makes us who we are?

[...] He added that [...] "there {{is no substitute for}} legitimacy" [...] as he vowed not to resign. Morsi accused supporters of Hosni Mubarak of exploiting the wave of protests to topple the government and fight democracy. After Morsi's statement, an official Facebook page of the Egyptian Armed Forces wrote a post under the title [...] "The Last Hours" [...] saying in response to Morsi: [...] "The Supreme Commander in Chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces had mentioned before that it's better for us to die rather than seeing the Egyptian People being threatened or horrified, and we swear that we would sacrifice our lives and <b>our</b> <b>blood</b> for Egypt against every terrorist or extremist or ignorant.

2500|$|Upon Lincoln's {{assassination}} in April 1865, Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, who {{had been}} elected with Lincoln in 1864 as vice president, became president. Johnson rejected the Radical program of Reconstruction and instead appointed his own governors and tried to finish reconstruction {{by the end of}} 1865. Thaddeus Stevens vehemently opposed President Johnson's plans for an abrupt end to Reconstruction, insisting that Reconstruction must [...] "revolutionize Southern institutions, habits, and manners... The foundations of their institutions... must be broken up and relaid, or all <b>our</b> <b>blood</b> and treasure have been spent in vain." [...] Johnson broke decisively with the Republicans in Congress when he vetoed the Civil Rights Act in early 1865. While Democrats cheered, the Republicans pulled together, passed the bill again, and overturned Johnson's repeat veto. Full-scale political warfare now existed between Johnson (now allied with the Democrats) and the Radical Republicans.|$|E
