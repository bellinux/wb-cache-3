Recent reviews of the effectiveness of <b>Operational</b> Experience <b>Feedback</b> (OEF) systems have pointed to the need for further improvement, with importance being placed on tailoring the information {{to the needs of the}} regulators. In 2007, at the request of a number of nuclear safety regulatory authorities in Europe, the Institute for Energy of the European Commission¿s Joint Research Centre (EC JRC) initiated a project on Nuclear Power Plant <b>operational</b> experience <b>feedback,</b> which adopts an integrated approach to the research needed to strengthen the European capabilities for assessment of NPP operational events and to promote the development of tools and mechanisms for the improved application of the lessons learned. Consequently, a so-called "European Clearinghouse" on NPP OEF was established, which includes scientific officers from the EC JRC, a number of European nuclear safety regulatory authorities and some of their Technical Support Organizations (TSOs). The paper discusses the activities implemented in 2008 within the framework of the European Clearinghouse on NPP OEF (hereinafter called the European NPP Clearinghouse) and provides an overview of the main conclusions drawn from the safety studies performed.
