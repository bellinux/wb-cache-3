50|$|One non-species C {{oncolytic}} adenovirus {{currently in}} development is ColoAd1. It was created using {{a process of}} “directed evolution”. This involves {{the creation of new}} viral variants or serotypes specifically directed against tumour cells via rounds of directed selection using large populations of randomly generated recombinant precursor viruses. The increased biodiversity produced by the initial homologous recombination step provides a large random pool of viral candidates which can then be passed through a series of selection steps designed to lead towards a pre-specified outcome (e.g. higher tumor specific activity) without requiring any previous knowledge of the resultant viral mechanisms that are responsible for that outcome.One particular application of this approach produced ColoAd1, which is a novel Ad11p/Ad3 chimeric Group B oncolytic virus with specificity for human colon cancer and a broad spectrum of anti-cancer activity in common solid tumours. The therapeutic efficacy of ColoAd1 is currently being evaluated in three ongoing clinical trials (see the EU Clinical Trials Register for further details).ColoAd1 potency can be further enhanced via the use of therapeutic transgenes, which can be introduced into the ColoAd1 genome without compromising the selectivity or activity of the virus.

This report was designed to further determine the form of taxol-induced cell death with cytoplasm vacuolization. It is generally considered that the cytoplasm vacuolization in <b>oncosis</b> due to the swelling of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, lysosomes and nuclei occurs after the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). However, flow cytometry (FCM) analysis showed that taxol-induced cytoplasm vacuolization preceded the loss of ΔΨm. Moreover, taxol treatment did not induce the collapse of microtubule, the typical characteristic of <b>oncosis.</b> These data demonstrated that taxol-induced cell death with cytoplasm vacuolization is not <b>oncosis.</b> FCM analysis by Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit further demonstrated that taxol-induced cell death with cytoplasm vacuolization is not apoptosis. In conclusion, in combination with our recent in vitro and in vivo data, this report further demonstrates that high concentration of taxol induces cell death with cytoplasm vacuolization in paraptosis-like but not <b>oncosis</b> fashion...|$|E

Accordingly, astrocytic death due to various types of injury can critically influence neuronal survival. The exact pathway of cell death after brain ischemia is under debate. In the present study, we used astrocytes from rat primary culture treated with persistent oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD) as a model of ischemia to examine the pathway of cell death and the relevant mechanisms. We observed changes in the cellular morphology, the energy metabolism of astrocytes, and the percentage of apoptosis or <b>oncosis</b> of the astrocytes induced by OGD. Electron microscopy revealed the co-existence of ultrastructural features in both apoptosis and <b>oncosis</b> in individual cells. The cellular ATP content was gradually decreased and the percentages of apoptotic and oncotic cells were increased during OGD. After 4 h of OGD. ATP depletion to less than 35 % of the control was observed, and <b>oncosis</b> became the primary pathway for astrocytic death. Increased plasma membrane permeability due to <b>oncosis</b> was associated with increased calpain-mediated degradation of several cytoskeletal proteins, including paxillin, vinculin, vimentin and GFAP. Pre-treatment with the calpain inhibitor 3 -(4 -iodophenyl) - 2 -mercapto-(Z) - 2 -propenoic acid (PD 150606) could delay the OGD-induced astrocytic <b>oncosis.</b> These results suggest that there is a narrow range of ATP that determines astrocytic oncotic death induced by persistent OGD and that calpain-mediated hydrolysis of the cytoskeletal-associated proteins may contribute to astrocytes <b>oncosis.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The issue was addressed by using caspase- 8 deficient, Bcl- 2 overexpressing JB 6 cells, which die by <b>oncosis</b> when stimulated with synthetic dsRNA. We observed by fluorescence microscopy that oncotic cells with preserved plasma membrane integrity showed PS exposure (annexin(+) /propidium iodide(-)). The data was confirmed on the ultrastructural level and PS was localized in <b>oncosis</b> at the outer leaflet of the continuous plasma membrane with preserved trilamellar structure. In postoncotic necrotic cells the immunogold labels were found on the plasma membrane and on the intracellular membranes of the cells, which underwent plasma membrane disruption.

30|$|<b>Oncosis</b> and {{apoptosis}} {{represent the}} two {{different ways in which}} cells undergo death. Apoptosis is an active process of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms. <b>Oncosis,</b> on the other hand, describes a caspase-independent cell death that is characterized by swelling, increased permeability, and membrane rupture, which {{is often referred to as}} necrosis. This form of cell death is believed to be accidental and uncontrolled. Based on our investigation, we found that Ats inhibited the growth of tumor cells and that the inhibition ratio was dependent on the dose of Ats. Ats primarily depended on the degree of <b>oncosis</b> and led to cell death; it also activated caspase-independent cell death in the form of <b>oncosis.</b> Conversely, and separately from the occurrence of obvious oncosis-like death, when tumor cells were treated with Ats-loaded BSA NPs, Ats-loaded BSA NPs were internalized into the cytoplasm and were quickly located within the mitochondria to release Ats, as mediated by the NPs. Ats in the mitochondria generated ROS and triggered ER stress; it further activated the mitochondria-meditated caspase-dependent cell apoptotic pathway by reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential, releasing cytochrome C, and promoting the protein expressions of Bax, cleaved caspase 3, and caspase 9. Taken together, Ats-loaded BSA NPs increased the mitochondrial delivery of Ats and enhanced the degree of <b>oncosis</b> and apoptosis to induce cell death, thus increasing the cytotoxicity of the drug and inducing significant cell death.|$|E

To identify the mammalian cell death pathway(s) mediating CPE-induced cell death, CaCo- 2 cultures were treated with either 1 or 10 μg of CPE per ml. Both CPE doses were found to induce morphological damage and DNA cleavage in CaCo- 2 cells. The <b>oncosis</b> inhibitor glycine, but not a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, was able to transiently block both of those pathological effects in CaCo- 2 cells treated with the higher, but not the lower, CPE dose. Conversely, a caspase 3 / 7 inhibitor (but not glycine or a caspase 1 inhibitor) blocked morphological damage and DNA cleavage in CaCo- 2 cells treated with the lower, but not the higher, CPE dose. Collectively, {{these results indicate that}} lower CPE doses cause caspase 3 / 7 -dependent apoptosis, while higher CPE doses induce <b>oncosis.</b> Apoptosis caused by the lower CPE dose was shown to proceed via a classical pathway involving mitochondrial membrane depolarization and cytochrome c release.

BackgroundThere are controversial results on the influence of fibrosis, CM hypertrophy, and apoptosis on outcomes in patients with HF; other modalities of cell damage have been poorly investigated. MethodsIn endomyocardial biopsy specimens from 100 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and advanced HF, CM diameter and the extent of fibrosis were determined by morphometry. The proportion of CMs with evidence of apoptosis, autophagic vacuolization (AuV), and <b>oncosis</b> was investigated by immunohistochemical methods and by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling. Those parameters were correlated with mortality in 3 years of follow-up by univariate analysis and with multivariate models incorporating the clinical variables more relevant to the prediction of outcomes. ResultsCM AuV occurred in 28 patients (0. 013 ± 0. 012 %) and <b>oncosis</b> in 41 (0. 109 ± 0. 139 %). Nineteen patients showed both markers. Apoptotic CM nuclei were observed in 3 patients. In univariate analysis, CM diameter and AuV, either alone or associated with <b>oncosis,</b> were predictors of mortality. In multivariate analysis, CM diameter (hazard ratio: 1. 37; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 12 to 1. 68; p = 0. 002) and simultaneous presence in the same endomyocardial biopsy specimen of AuV and <b>oncosis</b> (hazard ratio: 2. 82; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 12 to 7. 13; p = 0. 028) were independent predictors of mortality.

The mechanism of how this protective effect is executed is unknown. RESULTS:HO- 1 induction with cobalt protoporphorin (Co-PP) dose-dependently protected against apoptotic cell death as well as neutrophil-mediated <b>oncosis</b> in the galactosamine/endotoxin (Gal/ET) shock model. Induction of HO- 1 with Co-PP dose-dependently protected against neutrophil-mediated <b>oncosis</b> as indicated by attenuated ALT release and TNF-mediated apoptotic cell death as indicated by reduced caspase- 3 activation. HO- 1 induction did not attenuate Gal/ET-induced TNF-alpha formation. Furthermore, a similar protective effect with the high dose of Co-PP was observed when animals were treated with Gal/TNF-alpha. CONCLUSIONS:HO- 1 induction attenuates apoptosis and neutrophil-mediated <b>oncosis</b> in the Gal/ET shock model.

To further determine the mechanisms involved, we investigated the effects of glucose, glucose degradation products (GDPs) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) on the inhibition of human peritoneal mesothelial cell (HPMC) proliferation and the induction of apoptosis and <b>oncosis.</b> METHODS: Four PDF solutions, heat-sterilized dextrose-lactate, filtered dextrose-lactate and heat-sterilized dextrose-bicarbonate-lactate, each containing 15 or 45 g/l glucose, and heat-sterilized icodextrin-lactate, containing 75 g/l icodextrin, were tested. In addition, we analysed the independent and synergistic effects of two glucose compounds, i. e. 3 -deoxyglucosone (3 -DG), a major GDP, and Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl) -lysine (CML), a high-affinity AGE receptor (RAGE) ligand on HPMC viability. Cell proliferation was measured by methyl-[(3) H]thymidine incorporation. <b>Oncosis</b> was quantified by nuclear propidium iodide (PI) DNA-intercalating capability, and apoptosis by the decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (triangle up psim). RESULTS: It was found that heat-sterilized dextrose-lactate inhibited HPMC proliferation {{to a greater extent than}} filtered dextrose-lactate, heat-sterilized dextrose-bicarbonate-lactate, or heat-sterilized icodextrin-lactate (P< 0. 001). Compared to filtered dextrose-lactate, heat-sterilized dextrose-lactate induced a significantly greater degree of apoptosis (P< 0. 05) and <b>oncosis</b> (P< 0. 01). Glucose-induced cell death and antiproliferative activity were significantly potentiated by the action of 3 -DG or CML-albumin. By blocking the AGE-RAGE interaction recombinant soluble-RAGE reduced the PDF-induced inhibitory effect on cell proliferation (P< 0. 001) and apoptosis (P< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Heat-sterilized PDFs that contain high glucose concentrations and GDPs, which are AGE precursors, reduce cell proliferation, induce mesothelial cell apoptosis and <b>oncosis,</b> and may be involved in peritoneal damage.

40|$|The {{pathways}} {{and identification}} of cell injury and cell death are of key {{importance to the}} practice of diagnostic and research toxicologic pathology. Following a lethal injury, cellular reactions are initially reversible. Currently, we recognize two patterns, <b>oncosis</b> and apoptosis. <b>Oncosis,</b> derived from the Greek word "swelling, " is the common pattern of change in infarcts and in zonal killing following chemical toxicity, e. g., centrilobular hepatic necrosis after CC 14 toxicity. In this common reaction, the earliest changes involve cytoplasmic blebbing, dilatation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), swelling of the cytosol, normal or condensed mitochondria, and chromatin clumping in the nucleus. In apoptosis, the early changes involve cell shrinkage, cytosolic shrinkage, more marked chromatin clumping, cytoplasmic blebbing, swollen ER on occasion, and mitochondria that are normal or condensed. Following cell death, both types undergo postmortem changes collectively termed "necrosis. " In the case of <b>oncosis,</b> this typically involves broad zones of cells while, in the case of apoptosis, the cells and/or the fragments are often phagocytized prior to their death by adjacent macrophages or parenchymal cells. In either case, the changes converge to a pattern that involves mitochondrial swelling, mitochondrial flocculent densities and/or calcification, karyolysis, and disruption of plasmalemmal continuity. The biochemical mechanisms of cell death are currently under intense study, particularly concerning the genes involved in the process. Pro-death genes include p 53, the ced- 3 /ICE proteases, and the Bax family. Anti-death genes include ced- 9 /Bcl- 2 and the adenovirus protein E 1 B.

The general hypothesis of this thesis was that detergent sclerosants at low concentrations induce {{the release of}} proinflammatory and proangiogenic cytokines. Leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells (ECs) were incubated with varying concentrations (0 %, 0. 075 %, 0. 15 %, 0. 30 %, 0. 60 % and 1. 2 %) of sclerosants. ELISA was used to detect the release of proinflammatory and proangiogenic cytokines. Interferon-g and tumour necrosis factor-a were released from STS-stimulated polymorphonuclear cells (PMNC). Both sclerosants induced the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Morphological changes were analysed using fluorescence microscopy. Nuclear and cytoplasmic changes consistent with cell activation, apoptosis, <b>oncosis</b> and senescence were found with both STS and POL at low concentrations (< 0. 3 %). Leukocyte and EC apoptosis was assessed using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Lactadherin and PI were used to stage apoptosis and Caspase- 3, - 8, - 9 and Bax to assess apoptotic pathways. Porimin {{was used to assess}} <b>oncosis.</b> STS induced activation of caspase- 3, - 8, - 9 and increase in Bax expression. POL only induced activation of Caspase - 3, - 9 and Bax.

Here, we presented atomic force spectroscopy (AFM)-based investigations at the nanoscale level to address the above fundamental biophysical questions. As increasing AM treatment time, T lymphocytes' volume nearly double increased and then decreased. The changes of nanostructural features of the cell membrane, i.e., mean height of particles, root-mean-square roughness (Rq), crack and fragment appearance, increased with AM treatment time. T lymphocytes were completely destroyed with 96 -h treatment, and they existed in the form of small fragments. Analysis of force-distance curves showed that the adhesion force of cell surface decreased significantly with the increase of AM treatment time, while the cell stiffness increased firstly and then decreased. These changes were closely correlated to the characteristics and process of cell <b>oncosis.</b> In total, these quantitative and qualitative changes of T lymphocytes' structure and nanomechanical properties suggested that AM could induce T lymphocyte <b>oncosis</b> to exert anti-inflammatory effects for treating asthma.

Campylobacter jejuni is a prevalent cause of bacterial enteritis; however, its effects on enterocytes remain unclear. The present study indicates for the first time that C. jejuni induces oncotic, rather than apoptotic death of T 84 enterocytes. C. jejuni-treated enterocytes exhibited extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation, rapid (3 – 6  h) loss of plasma membrane integrity (‘cytotoxicity’), loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and ATP depletion. Enterocytes also exhibited increased oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a feature characteristic of apoptosis. However, consistent with a non-apoptotic process, DNA fragmentation and cytotoxicity were not caspase dependent. During apoptosis, caspases mediate cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; however, cleavage was not observed in C. jejuni-treated monolayers. Cytotoxicity, ATP depletion and DNA fragmentation were not prevented by the deletion of the cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) gene, indicating that C. jejuni causes enterocyte <b>oncosis</b> via a mechanism that is CDT independent. The ability to cause <b>oncosis</b> was significantly decreased in a FlaAFlaB mutant (CDT+) that was defective in the ability to adhere and invade enterocytes.

Time-lapse microscopy of the infection process revealed the rapid accumulation of motile bacteria around infected cells undergoing {{the process of}} <b>oncosis,</b> a phenomenon we termed pack swarming. Characterization of the non-chemotactic CHAcheZ mutant showed that pack swarming is a bacterial chemotactic response to infected macrophages. A non-cytotoxic mutant, lacking the type III-secreted proteins PcrV, PopB and PopD, was able to pack swarm only {{in the presence of}} the parental strain CHA or when macrophages were pretreated with the pore-forming toxin streptolysin O.

The pore inserted into RBC membrane was estimated from osmoprotection experiments to be between 2. 8 and 3. 5 nm. CHA-infected macrophages could be protected from cell lysis with PEG 3350, indicating that the pore introduced into RBC and macrophage membranes is of similar size.

40|$|The {{historical}} {{development of the}} cell death concept is reviewed, with {{special attention to the}} origin of the terms necrosis, coagulation necrosis, autolysis, physiological cell death, programmed cell death, chromatolysis (the first name of apoptosis in 1914), karyorhexis, karyolysis, and cell suicide, of which there are three forms: by lysosomes, by free radicals, and by a genetic mechanism (apoptosis). Some of the typical features of apoptosis are discussed, such as budding (as opposed to blebbing and zeiosis) and the inflammatory response. For cell death not by apoptosis the most satisfactory term is accidental cell death. Necrosis is commonly used but it is not appropriate, because it does not indicate a form of cell death but refers to changes secondary to cell death by any mechanism, including apoptosis. Abundant data are available on one form of accidental cell death, namely ischemic cell death, which can be considered an entity of its own, caused by failure of the ionic pumps of the plasma membrane. Because ischemic cell death (in known models) is accompanied by swelling, the name <b>oncosis</b> is proposed for this condition. The term <b>oncosis</b> (derived from onkos, meaning swelling) was proposed in 1910 by von Reckling-hausen precisely to mean cell death with swelling. <b>Oncosis</b> leads to necrosis with karyolysis and stands in contrast to apoptosis, which leads to necrosis with karyorhexis and cell shrinkage...|$|E
40|$|What {{dictates}} {{whether a}} cell dies by apoptosis or necrosis (<b>oncosis)</b> ? Although cell-specific characteristics exist, the main determinant {{seems to be}} the intensity or duration of the insult. In vitro models of cell injury have shown that as the degree of insult increases, the mode of cell death shifts from apoptosis to necrosis (Kass and Orrenius, 1999; Yuan et al., 2003) that is thought to result from a loss of cellular energy (Leist et al., 1997; Tsujimoto, 1997). Without ATP, cells fail to complete apoptosis and die by necrosis. This paradigm seems applicable to drug-induced liver injury in vivo. For instance, Ledda-Columbano et al.

In situ tailing and nick translation of fragmented DNA, agarose gel electrophoresis of plaque DNA and electron microscopy were used to identify cell death by apoptosis (programmed cell death) and <b>oncosis.</b> The mean number of cells containing fragmented DNA in the plaques was 12. 7 ± 3. 5 % (n = 15). Focal accumulations of cells with DNA fragmentation occurred in the fibrous cap, at sites of rupture, close to lipid deposits and necrosis and was always accompanied by the presence of inflammatory cells. Electrophoretic separation of DNA isolated from part of plaques, where the presence of DNA fragmentation had previously been demonstrated by in situ DNA nick translation, resulted in multiple ladders of 180 - 200 base pairs characteristic of apoptosis. Electron microscopic analysis revealed presence of cells with morphological signs of degeneration in a frequency even higher than that found by in situ nick translation. Some of these cells had a characteristic apoptotic appearance with condensed chromatin and cytoplasm, but the large majority of the cells had an ultrastructure typical for cells undergoing cell death by <b>oncosis</b> with membrane disruption and swollen, disintegrating organelles. Thus, although apoptosis clearly takes place in atherosclerotic plaques, <b>oncosis</b> appears to be a much more common mechanism for cell death...|$|E
30|$|According to the {{protocol}} of our previous study [28], an Annexin V–fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) staining assay {{was used to}} evaluate the cell <b>oncosis</b> and apoptosis induced by free Ats and Ats-loaded BSA NPs. Cells were lysed with typsin and seeded into six-well plates at a concentration of l[*]×[*]l 06  cells/mL for 24  h of continuous incubation. Next, the culture medium was removed and serum-free medium containing free Ats and Ats-loaded BSA NPs was added into the wells. After treatment, the cells were collected and suspended in Nicoletti buffer (Beijing 4 A Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, People’s Republic of China) containing PI- and FITC-labeled Annexin V (AV-FITC). The morphological change of the cells was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. To verify the cell apoptosis and <b>oncosis</b> rates induced by the Ats-loaded NPs, the percentages of early apoptotic (Q 4), oncotic (Q 2), necrotic (Q 1), and live cells (Q 3) were quantified by flow cytometry.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that myocyte loss in failing human hearts occurs by different mechanisms: apoptosis, <b>oncosis,</b> and autophagic cell death. Explanted hearts from 19 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20 %) and 7 control hearts were analyzed. Myocyte apoptosis revealed by caspase- 3 activation and TUNEL staining occurred {{at a rate of}} 0. 0020. 0005 % (P 0. 05 versus control) and <b>oncosis</b> assessed by complement 9 labeling at 0. 060. 001 % (P 0. 05). Cellular degeneration including appearance of ubiquitin containing autophagic vacuoles and nuclear disintegration was present at the ultrastructural level. Nuclear and cytosolic ubiquitin/protein accumulations occurred at 0. 080. 004 % (P 0. 05). The ubiquitin-activating enzyme E 1 and the ligase E 3 were not different from control. In contrast, ubiquitin mRNA levels were 1. 8 -fold (P 0. 02) elevated, and the conjugating enzyme E 2 was 2. 3 -fold upregulated (P 0. 005). The most important finding, however, is the 2. 3 -fold downregulation of the deubiquitination enzyme isopeptidase-T and the 1. 5 -fold reduction of the ubiquitin-fusion degradation system- 1, which in conjunction with unchanged proteasomal subunit levels and proteasomal activity results in massive storage of ubiquitin/protein complexes and in autophagic cell death. A 2 -fold decrease of cathepsin D might be an additional factor responsible for the accumulation of ubiquitin/protein conjugates. It is concluded that in human failing hearts apoptosis, <b>oncosis,</b> and autophagy act in parallel to varying degrees. A disturbed balance between a high rate of ubiquitination and inadequate degradation of ubiquitin/protein conjugates may contribute to autophagic cell death. Together, these differen...|$|E
30|$|The {{percentages}} of early apoptotic (Q 4), oncotic (Q 2), necrotic (Q 1), and live cells (Q 3) were shown in Fig.  5 b. This finding demonstrated that when cells {{were treated with}} free Ats, the oncotic rates were gradually increased to 24.4 and 4.6 %, and the apoptotic rate remained at 4.9 and 7.1 % in SMMC- 7721 cells and Plc cells, respectively, suggesting that free Ats triggered the occurrence of <b>oncosis</b> and apoptosis to lead to cell death. On the contrary, Ats-loaded BSA NPs significantly improved the rate of cell apoptosis and <b>oncosis.</b> The apoptotic ratios were significantly increased to 10.9 % in SMMC- 7721 cells and to 11.5 % in Plc cells. The oncotic ratios were increased to 29.0 % in SMMC- 7721 cells and to 21.6 % in Plc cells. This indicated that the mitochondrial delivery of Ats with the mediation of BSA NPs accelerated the death of tumor cells by enhancing the oncotic and apoptotic effects. Ats-loaded BSA NPs triggered the apoptotic signal transduction process and promoted the mitochondrial-mediated cascade reaction of cellular apoptosis.|$|E
40|$|Infection {{of human}} monocyte-derived {{macrophage}}s (HMDM) and J 774 cells (murine macrophage cell line) with several enteroaggregative and cytodetaching Escherichia coli (EAggEC and CDEC, respectively) strains demonstrated that some strains could induce macrophage cell death accompanied by release of lactate dehydrogenase activity and interleukin 1 β (IL- 1 β) into culture supernatants. The mode of cell death differed {{in the two}} types of macrophages. Damage to macrophage plasma membrane integrity without changes in nuclear morphology resulted in cytolysis of HMDM. This mechanism of cell death has been previously described for virulent Shigella infection of HMDM and is termed <b>oncosis.</b> In contrast, infection of J 774 cells by EAggEC and CDEC strains resulted in apoptosis. The presence of α-hemolysin (Hly) in EAggEC and CDEC strains appears to be critical for both <b>oncosis</b> in HMDM and apoptosis in J 774 cells. Bacteria lacking Hly, including Hly− EAggEC strains as well as enterotoxigenic, enteropathogenic, and enterohemorrhagic E. coli strains, behaved like avirulent Shigella flexneri in that the macrophage monolayers were intact, with no release of lactate dehydrogenase activity or IL- 1 β into the culture supernatants...|$|E
40|$|Apoptosis {{consists}} of a distinct form of cell death that displays characteristic alterations in cell morphology and cell fate which are different than death due to <b>oncosis</b> or necrosis. Deregulated apoptosis has been implicated in the development {{a wide variety of}} human diseases. Excessive apoptotic cell death may cause organ atrophy and organ failure. On the other hand, insufficient elimination of redundant cells may lead to organ and tissue structural remodeling. Statins induce apoptosis in different cell culture systems...|$|E
40|$|Infection {{of human}} monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro with virulent Shigella flexneri {{resulted}} in cell death which involved rupture of the plasma membrane, cell swelling, disintegration of ultrastructure, and generalized karyolysis. These features bore resemblance to <b>oncosis</b> {{and are in}} striking contrast to previously described observations of mouse macrophages, where a similar infection by virulent Shigella resulted in cell death by apoptosis. Cell death by <b>oncosis</b> in human macrophages was confirmed by lactate dehydrogenase release, light microscopy, electron microscopy, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase end labeling of DNA ends, DNA fragmentation assays, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of propidium-labeled nuclei. Thus, the phenomena of cell death induced by virulent Shigella in human and mouse macrophages reflect different biochemical pathways. Interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) was released in culture supernatants of human macrophages infected with virulent bacteria. Inhibition with IL- 1 beta-converting enzyme inhibitors indicated, however, that this release occurred as a passive event of cell lysis. The patterns of intracellular survival of Shigella strains within human and mouse macrophages reflect differences that exist not only between Shigella serotypes but also between the two different macrophage cell types...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral blood {{lymphocytes}} irradiated {{with low}} and moderate doses of low {{linear energy transfer}} (LET) gamma-rays are known to die by an apoptotic process. In the present study, the type of interphase death occuring after administration of moderate and high doses of low LET gamma-rays and high LET fast neutrons was investigated. Lymphocytes were irradiated in vitro with radiation doses of 5 and 20 gray (Gy) of both radiation qualities. They were cultured for 24 or 48 hours {{and the type of}} cell death induced was determined by electron microscopy. After neutron irradiation, a slight increase in the incidence of apoptosis from 5 to 20 Gy was found, whereas after gamma-irradiation, the incidence of apoptosis was lower at 20 Gy as compared to 5 Gy. However, unlike the other radiation doses, the 20 Gy dose of gamma-rays, besides apoptosis also induced <b>oncosis</b> (classical necrosis). According to our experiments, membranes are probably an important target for the induction of interphase death. It is suggested that a great amount of ionisations distributed all over the cell surface, as caused by high doses of gamma-rays, lead to a high influx of Ca++, which induces <b>oncosis</b> instead of apoptosis...|$|E
