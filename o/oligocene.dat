5|$|According to Lucas and Sobus, {{the type}} species P. bugtiense {{from the late}} <b>Oligocene</b> of Pakistan {{includes}} junior synonyms such as B. osborni and P. zhajremensis. P. transouralicum, formerly Indricotherium, from the late <b>Oligocene</b> of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and northern China includes B. grangeri and I. minus. P. orgosensis, formerly Dzungariotherium, from the middle and late <b>Oligocene</b> of northwest China includes D. turfanensis and P. lipidus. P. orgosensis may be distinct enough to warrant its original genus name, but its exact position requires evaluation. P. prohorovi from the late <b>Oligocene</b> of Kazakhstan may be too incomplete for its position to be resolved {{in relation to the}} other species; the same applies to proposed species such as I. intermedium and P. tienshanensis, as well as genera like Benaratherium and Caucasotherium. Though the genus name Indricotherium is now a junior synonym of Paraceratherium, the subfamily name Indricotheriinae is still in use because genus name synonymy does not affect the names of higher level taxa that are derived from these. Members of the subfamily are therefore still commonly referred to as indricotheres.|$|E
5|$|The Colletidae {{appear as}} fossils {{only from the}} late <b>Oligocene</b> (~25 Mya) to early Miocene.|$|E
5|$|Three {{stages of}} tectonic {{activity}} have been noted; Late Cretaceous, Paleocene-Early Eocene and Middle Eocene to <b>Oligocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the Paleocene and Eocene, most mammals {{remained}} small (under 20 kg). Cooling {{climate in}} the <b>Oligocene</b> and Miocene, {{and the expansion}} of grasslands favored the evolution of larger mammalian species.|$|E
5|$|Sibley and Ahlquist's {{molecular}} {{study of}} the evolution of the bird families has put the radiation of the Procellariiformes in the <b>Oligocene</b> period (35–30 million years ago), though this group probably originated earlier, with a fossil sometimes attributed to the order, a seabird known as Tytthostonyx, being found in late Cretaceous rocks (70 mya). The molecular evidence suggests that the storm petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellarids and diving petrels separating later. The earliest fossil albatrosses were found in Eocene to <b>Oligocene</b> rocks, although some of these are only tentatively assigned to the family and none appear to be particularly close to the living forms. They are Murunkus (Middle Eocene of Uzbekistan), Manu (early <b>Oligocene</b> of New Zealand), and an undescribed form from the Late <b>Oligocene</b> of South Carolina. Similar to the last was Plotornis, formerly often considered a petrel but now accepted as an albatross. It is from the Middle Miocene of France, a time when the split between the four modern genera was already underway as evidenced by Phoebastria californica and Diomedea milleri, both being mid-Miocene species from Sharktooth Hill, California. These show that the split between the great albatrosses and the North Pacific albatrosses occurred by 15 mya. Similar fossil finds in the Southern Hemisphere put the split between the sooties and mollymawks at 10 mya.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{members of}} Ursidae {{belong to the}} extinct subfamily Amphicynodontinae, including Parictis (late Eocene to early middle Miocene, 38–18 Mya) and the slightly younger Allocyon (early <b>Oligocene,</b> 34–30 Mya), both from North America. These animals looked very different from today's bears, being small and raccoon-like in overall appearance, and diets perhaps more {{similar to that of}} a badger. Parictis does not appear in Eurasia and Africa until the Miocene. It is unclear whether late-Eocene ursids were also present in Eurasia, although faunal exchange across the Bering land bridge may have been possible during a major sea level low stand as early as the late Eocene (about 37 Mya) and continuing into the early <b>Oligocene.</b> European genera morphologically are very similar to Allocyon, and to the much younger American Kolponomos (about 18 Mya), are known from the <b>Oligocene,</b> including Amphicticeps and Amphicynodon.|$|E
5|$|Anoplotherium is an extinct mammal {{from the}} Eocene to <b>Oligocene</b> epochs, first found near Paris. Hawkins's models draw on Owen's {{speculation}} about its camel-like appearance. (They are now {{thought to be}} related to hippopotamus and pigs). Three models were made, forming a small herd.|$|E
5|$|Dermotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals {{closely related to}} the living colugos, a small group of gliding mammals from Southeast Asia. Two species are recognized: D.major from the Late Eocene of Thailand, based on a single {{fragment}} of the lower jaw, and D.chimaera from the Late <b>Oligocene</b> of Thailand, known from three fragments of the lower jaw and two isolated upper molars. In addition, a single isolated upper molar from the Early <b>Oligocene</b> of Pakistan has been tentatively assigned to D.chimaera. All sites where fossils of Dermotherium have been found probably developed in forested environments and the fossil species probably were forest dwellers like living colugos, but whether they already had the gliding adaptations of the living species is unknown.|$|E
5|$|During the Cretaceous period, a few {{species of}} {{primitive}} ants ranged widely on the Laurasian supercontinent (the Northern Hemisphere). They were scarce {{in comparison to}} the populations of other insects, representing only about 1% of the entire insect population. Ants became dominant after adaptive radiation {{at the beginning of the}} Paleogene period. By the <b>Oligocene</b> and Miocene, ants had come to represent 20–40% of all insects found in major fossil deposits. Of the species that lived in the Eocene epoch, around one in 10 genera survive to the present. Genera surviving today comprise 56% of the genera in Baltic amber fossils (early <b>Oligocene),</b> and 92% of the genera in Dominican amber fossils (apparently early Miocene).|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the {{discovery}} of Bugtilemur, a fossil primate from Pakistan dating to the <b>Oligocene</b> and initially {{thought to be a}} cheirogaleid lemur, further challenged the theory of lemur origins; however, it was later shown to be a type of adapiform primate and not a lemur.|$|E
5|$|Notharctids, {{which most}} closely resembled some of Madagascar's lemurs, come from Europe and North America. The European branch is often {{referred}} to as cercamoniines. The North American branch thrived during the Eocene, but did not survive into the <b>Oligocene.</b> Like the adapids, the European branch were also extinct by the end of the Eocene.|$|E
5|$|Paali Nala, {{where the}} M2 {{tentatively}} assigned to Dermotherium chimaera was found, {{is in the}} Bugti Hills of Balochistan, western Pakistan. The fossil locality, placed stratigraphically in the Bugti Member of the Chitarwata Formation, {{is thought to be}} Early <b>Oligocene</b> in age. The Paali Nala fauna also contains a diverse array of mammals, including many rodents, some primates, and rhinos.|$|E
5|$|The raccoon-sized, dog-like Cephalogale is the oldest-known {{member of}} the {{subfamily}} Hemicyoninae, which first appeared during the middle <b>Oligocene</b> in Eurasia about 30 Mya. The subfamily includes the younger genera Phoberocyon (20–15 Mya), and Plithocyon (15–7 Mya). A Cephalogale-like species {{gave rise to the}} genus Ursavus during the early <b>Oligocene</b> (30–28 Mya); this genus proliferated into many species in Asia and is ancestral to all living bears. Species of Ursavus subsequently entered North America, together with Amphicynodon and Cephalogale, during the early Miocene (21–18 Mya). Members of the living lineages of bears diverged from Ursavus between 15 and 20 Mya, likely via the species Ursavus elmensis. Based on genetic and morphological data, the Ailuropodinae (pandas) were the first to diverge from other living bears about 19 Mya, although no fossils of this group have been found before about 5 Mya.|$|E
5|$|The specializations of dermopterans {{are such}} that they are {{dependent}} on a forested habitat, and reconstructions of the paleoenvironments at Krabi, Nong Ya Plong, and Paali Nala suggest that all three fossil deposits developed in a humid, tropical forest environment. Their extinction in the Indian subcontinent may {{have been caused by}} the development of a drier climate there during the Late <b>Oligocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Within the Narcisseae, Narcissus (western Mediterranean) diverged from Sternbergia (Eurasia) {{some time}} in the Late <b>Oligocene</b> to Early Miocene eras, around 29.3–18.1 Ma, with a best {{estimate}} of 23.6 Ma. Later the genus divided into the two subgenera (Hermione and Narcissus) between 27.4–16.1 Ma (21.4 Ma). The divisions between the sections of Hermione then took place during the Miocene period 19.9–7.8 Ma.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{generally}} agreed that the aye-aye is the most basal member of the lemur clade, {{the relationship between the}} other four families is less clear since they diverged during a narrow 10 to 12million-year window between the Late Eocene (42mya) and into the <b>Oligocene</b> (30mya). Although all studies place Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae as a sister clade to Indriidae and Lemuridae, some suggest that Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae diverged first, while others suggest that Indriidae and Lemuridae were the first to branch off.|$|E
5|$|Apeomyoides is {{a member}} of the Eomyidae, a diverse rodent family that is now extinct. Eomyids first {{appeared}} in the Middle Eocene (~47 million years ago, mya) in North America, where they existed until the end of the Miocene (~5 mya). In Europe, they survived a little longer, until the end of the Pliocene (~2–3 mya). Apeomyoides is further part of a distinctive subgroup of eomyids known as the Apeomyinae. The first apeomyine to be discovered was Apeomys tuerkheimae, named in 1968 based on fossils from the Early Miocene of Germany, and later discoveries have expanded the range of Apeomys and similar taxa. In 1998, Oldřich Fejfar and colleagues reviewed Apeomys and identified a second, related genus Megapeomys, from the Early Miocene of Germany, the Czech Republic, and Japan. These scientists also named a new eomyid subfamily, Apeomyinae, to house Apeomys and Megapeomys. The Japanese Megapeomys was named as a separate species, Megapeomys repenningi, in 2011. Further apeomyines have been identified in North America: Megapeomys bobwilsoni from the Hemingfordian of Nevada, Apeomyoides savagei from the Barstovian of Nevada, Zophoapeomys indicum from the Late <b>Oligocene</b> of South Dakota, and a possible second species of Zophoapeomys from the Late <b>Oligocene</b> of Nebraska. Another North American eomyid, Arikareeomys skinneri, from the Arikareean of Nebraska, has also been reidentified as an apeomyine.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{whales are}} {{rorquals}} (family Balaenopteridae), {{a family that}} includes the humpback whale, the fin whale, Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the minke whale. The family Balaenopteridae {{is believed to have}} diverged from the other families of the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle <b>Oligocene</b> (28 Ma ago). It is not known when the members of those families diverged from each other.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of Dermotherium {{chimaera}} {{come from}} Phetchaburi Province, {{further to the}} north in Thailand. The fossil deposits, located in the Cha Prong pit in a coal mine called Nong Ya Plong, are dated to the Late <b>Oligocene.</b> Other mammals found here include the rodent Fallomus ladakhensis, the rhinoceros Diceratherium sp. cf. D.lamilloquense, the carnivoran Chaprongictis phetchaburiensis, the lipotyphlan Siamosorex debonisi, and a pteropodid bat.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon faced {{a highly}} {{competitive}} environment. However, its position {{at the top of}} the food chain probably had a profound impact on the structuring of marine communities. Fossil evidence indicates a correlation between megalodon and the emergence and diversification of cetaceans and other marine mammals. Juvenile megalodon preferred habitats where small cetaceans were abundant, and adult megalodon preferred habitats where large cetaceans were abundant. Such preferences may have developed shortly after they appeared in the <b>Oligocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Cervus (and hence early {{relatives}} or possible ancestors of the elk) first appear in the fossil record 25 million years ago, during the <b>Oligocene</b> in Eurasia, but do {{not appear in the}} North American fossil record until the early Miocene. The extinct Irish elk (Megaloceros) was not a member {{of the genus}} Cervus, but rather the largest member of the wider deer family (Cervidae) known from the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|Once safely {{established}} on Madagascar, with its limited mammalian population, the lemurs were {{protected from the}} increasing competition from evolving arboreal mammalian groups. Monkeys had evolved by the <b>Oligocene,</b> and their intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness may have given them the advantage in exploiting the environment over the diurnal adapiform primates in Africa and Asia, ultimately driving them to extinction and leaving only the nocturnal lorisoids.|$|E
5|$|Pierre Mein and Léonard Ginsburg {{described}} Lagrivea vireti in 2002 in {{a review}} of the ages and faunas of the Miocene fossil sites of La Grive-Saint-Alban in southeastern France. They suggested that it was probably a tree squirrel and related to the Sciurini. Lagrivea belongs to the squirrel family (Sciuridae), which first appears in the Late Eocene of North America and Early <b>Oligocene</b> of Europe. The specific name, vireti, honors Jean Viret for his work on the mammals of La Grive-Saint-Alban.|$|E
5|$|The Santa Rosa fossil site, where LACM 149371 was found, {{is in the}} Ucayali Region of Peru. The Santa Rosa fauna also {{contains}} fossils of various unique species of marsupials and hystricognath rodents, a possible bat, and some notoungulates (a unique extinct group of South American ungulates). The age of this fauna is unclear, and estimates range from near the Eocene–Oligocene boundary (~35mya) to the late <b>Oligocene</b> (~25mya). The Santa Rosa mammals may have lived in a savanna habitat that contained rivers.|$|E
5|$|The Sirenia, {{commonly}} referred to as sea cows or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. The Sirenia currently comprise the families Dugongidae (the dugong) and Trichechidae (manatees) with a total of four species. The Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct. Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago. The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early <b>Oligocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{bald eagle}} forms a species pair with the Eurasian white-tailed eagle. This species pair {{consists}} of a white-headed and a tan-headed species of roughly equal size; the white-tailed eagle also has overall somewhat paler brown body plumage. The two species fill the same ecological niche in their respective ranges. The pair diverged from other sea eagles {{at the beginning of}} the Early Miocene (c. 10Ma BP) at the latest, but possibly as early as the Early/Middle <b>Oligocene,</b> 28 Ma BP, if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to this genus.|$|E
5|$|The first toothless {{ancestors}} of Mysticetes {{appeared before the}} first radiation in the late <b>Oligocene.</b> Eomysticetus {{and others like it}} showed no evidence in the skull of echolocation abilities, suggesting they mainly relied on their eyesight for navigation. The eomysticetes had long, flat rostra that lacked teeth and had blowholes located halfway up the dorsal side of the snout. Though the palate is not well-preserved in these specimens, they are thought to have had baleen and been filter feeders. Miocene baleen whales were preyed upon by larger predators like killer sperm whales and Megalodon.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} for bees is {{incomplete}} with around 11 specimens that might possibly be Bombini, some poorly documented, had {{been described by}} 2011; some (such as Calyptapis florissantensis from Florissant, USA, and Oligoapis beskonakensis from , Turkey) dated from the <b>Oligocene.</b> In 2012 a fossil bumblebee, Bombus (Bombus) randeckensis was described from the Miocene Randeck Maar in southwestern Germany and confidently placed in the subgenus Bombus.|$|E
5|$|The genus {{appeared}} {{some time}} in the Late <b>Oligocene</b> to Early Miocene eras, around 24 million years ago, in the Iberian peninsula. While the exact origin of the word Narcissus is unknown it is frequently linked to its fragrance which was thought to be narcotic, and to the legend of the youth of that name who fell in love with his reflection. In the English language the common name Daffodil appears to be derived from the Asphodel with which it was commonly compared.|$|E
5|$|The genus is characterised by large, slender {{workers with}} {{elongated}} mandibles, which are narrow and triangular in shape. The mesosoma and appendages are also long. These ants {{are similar in}} appearance to Nothomyrmecia, but can be distinguished from the shape of their node. They also had a powerful sting located in the abdomen. Two of the three species are from the Eocene while the third species is from the Late <b>Oligocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{last of the}} sirenian {{families}} to appear, Trichechidae, apparently arose from early dugongids in the late Eocene or early <b>Oligocene.</b> It is a monophyletic taxa. In 1994, the family was expanded to not only include the subfamily Trichechinae (Potamosiren, Ribodon, and Trichechus), but also Miosireninae (Anomotherium and Miosiren). The African manatee and the West Indian manatee are {{more closely related to}} each other than to the Amazonian manatee.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the present}} classification, the meat ant {{is a member}} of the genus Iridomyrmex in the tribe Leptomyrmecini, {{subfamily}} Dolichoderinae. It {{is a member of}} the family Formicidae, belonging to the order Hymenoptera, an order of insects containing ants, bees, and wasps. The genus Froggattella is the sister group of Iridomyrmex, both of which are in a clade that is 23 million years old. Fossils related to the meat ant and other species are from the Eocene and <b>Oligocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Volcanic {{activity}} {{has occurred in}} parts of Iran since the Cretaceous period. During the Eocene and <b>Oligocene</b> epochs, volcanic activity reached its maximum, with thick pyroclastic layers being deposited in central Iran and the Alborz mountains. The area around Taftan volcano belongs to a tectonic zone which is variously {{referred to as the}} Sistan suture or the Zabul-Baloch zone. There, after a previous episode of rifting and subsequent formation of an ocean, the Neh and Lut tectonic blocks collided during the Eocene epoch after a subduction episode that commenced in the Maastrichtian age.|$|E
5|$|While {{some small}} teeth have been found, few fossilized skeletons of manta rays have been discovered. Their {{cartilaginous}} skeletons do not preserve {{well as they}} lack the calcification of the bony fish. Only three sedimentary beds bearing manta ray fossils are known, one from the <b>Oligocene</b> in South Carolina and two from the Miocene and Pliocene in North Carolina. Remains of an extinct species {{have been found in}} the Chandler Bridge Formation of South Carolina. These were originally described as Manta fragilis but were later reclassified as Paramobula fragilis.|$|E
5|$|While the {{earliest}} megalodon remains were reported from the Late <b>Oligocene</b> dated to around 28 {{million years ago}} (mya), competing figures still exist as to when it evolved, such as 16 mya and 23 mya. It is believed that megalodon became extinct {{around the end of}} the Pliocene, probably about 2.6 mya; reported Pleistocene megalodon teeth, younger than 2.6 million years old, are considered to be unreliable claims.|$|E
5|$|Within the Narcisseae, Narcissus (western Mediterranean) diverged from Sternbergia (Eurasia) {{some time}} in the Late <b>Oligocene</b> to Early Miocene eras, around 29.3–18.1 Ma. Later the genus divided into the two subgenera (Hermione and Narcissus) between 27.4–16.1 Ma. The {{divisions}} between the sections of Hermione then took place during the Miocene period 19.9–7.8 Ma. Narcissus appears to have arisen {{in the area of the}} Iberian peninsula, southern France and north-western Italy. Subgenus Hermione in turn arose in the southwestern mediterranean and north west Africa.|$|E
