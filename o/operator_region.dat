5|$|Many prokaryotic {{genes are}} {{organized}} into operons, with multiple protein-coding sequences that are transcribed as a unit. The genes in an operon are transcribed {{as a continuous}} messenger RNA, {{referred to as a}} polycistronic mRNA. The term cistron in this context is equivalent to gene. The transcription of an operon’s mRNA is often controlled by a repressor that can occur in an active or inactive state depending on the presence of certain specific metabolites. When active, the repressor binds to a DNA sequence {{at the beginning of the}} operon, called the <b>operator</b> <b>region,</b> and represses transcription of the operon; when the repressor is inactive transcription of the operon can occur (see e.g. Lac operon). The products of operon genes typically have related functions and are involved in the same regulatory network.|$|E
50|$|The gua operon is {{responsible}} for regulating the synthesis of guanosine mono phosphate(GMP), a purine nucleotide, from inosine monophosphate (IMP or inosinate).

50|$|The lacZYA {{repressor}} is constitutively expressed. It {{is always}} {{bound to the}} <b>operator</b> <b>region</b> of the promoter, which interferes with the ability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to begin transcription of the lacZYA operon. In {{the presence of the}} inducer allolactose, the repressor changes conformation and falls off the operator. RNAP is then able to bind to the promoter and begin transcription of the lacZYA gene.|$|E

50|$|The operon {{operates}} by {{a negative}} repressible feedback mechanism. The repressor for the trp operon is produced upstream by the trpR gene, which is constitutively expressed {{at a low}} level. Synthesized trpR monomers associate into dimers. When tryptophan is present, these tryptophan repressor dimers bind to tryptophan, causing {{a change in the}} repressor conformation, allowing the repressor to bind to the operator. This prevents RNA polymerase from binding to and transcribing the operon, so tryptophan is not produced from its precursor. When tryptophan is not present, the repressor is in its inactive conformation and cannot bind the <b>operator</b> <b>region,</b> so transcription is not inhibited by the repressor.|$|E
50|$|During normal growth, the SOS {{genes are}} {{negatively}} regulated by LexA repressor protein dimers. Under normal conditions, LexA binds to a 20-bp consensus sequence (the SOS box) in the <b>operator</b> <b>region</b> for those genes. Some of these SOS genes are expressed at certain levels {{even in the}} repressed state, according to the affinity of LexA for their SOS box. Activation of the SOS genes occurs after DNA damage by the accumulation of single stranded (ssDNA) regions generated at replication forks, where DNA polymerase is blocked. RecA forms a filament around these ssDNA regions in an ATP-dependent fashion, and becomes activated. The activated form of RecA interacts with the LexA repressor to facilitate the LexA repressor's self-cleavage from the operator.|$|E
5000|$|... 6. Expression {{control of}} a gene with a repressible {{promoter}} Transcription of a gene having a repressible promoter upstream of the open reading frame is repressed by combination of the so-called holo-repressor with the <b>operator</b> <b>region</b> on the DNA. When a specified chemical compound exists in the culture liquid, the compound (or its metabolite) in the cells combines as co-repressor with an apo-repressor (a kind of transcription factor) to form the holo-repressor. Keeping the concentration of this compound {{as low as possible}} (while still allowing for sufficient cell growth) permits continued expression of the regulated gene. Fed-batch culture is a powerful technique to do so.Examples of the repressible promoter are trp promoter and phoA promoter.|$|E

In the present study, cis elements and trans-acting factors responsible for the gene expression of MCRs were investigated by using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and affinity particle purification. A survey of their <b>operator</b> <b>regions</b> by EMSA with protein extracts from mrt-expressing cultures restricted them to 46 - and 41 -bp-long mcr and mrt upstream regions, respectively. Affinity particle purification of DNA-binding proteins conjugated with putative <b>operator</b> <b>regions</b> resulted in the retrieval of a protein attributed to IMP dehydrogenase-related protein VII (IMPDH VII). IMPDH VII is predicted to have a winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and two cystathionine β-synthase domains, {{and it has been}} suspected to be an energy-sensing module. EMSA with oligonucleotide probes with unusual sequences showed that the binding site of IMPDH VII mostly overlaps the factor B-responsible element-TATA box of the mcr operon. The results presented here suggest that IMPDH VII encoded by MTH 126 is a plausible candidate for the transcriptional regulator of the mcr operon in this methanogen...|$|R

50|$|The lysogenicstate of P2 is {{promoted}} and {{maintained by the}} C repressor. It is a 99-aminoacids polypeptide and binds to only one <b>operator</b> <b>region</b> which regulates theexpression of the early genes: cox, Band possibly A. Research has shownthat C repressor can both positively and negatively regulate its own Pc promoteras Pc is up regulated at low C level and down regulated at high levels. Since the C repressor is notinactivated by the SOS/RecA system of E.coli, the P2 prophage is non-inducible by ultraviolet irradiation. Furthermore, even if C repressor is inactivated, the P2 prophage is unableto excise, {{due to lack of}} int expression. Hence, P2 has been regarded as theprototype for the non-inducible class of temperate phages. The mechanism about how P2 solve theinduction-excision paradox still remains unknown.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the French {{molecular}} biologists François Jacob and Jacques Monod {{became the first}} to explain enzyme induction, {{in the context of}} the lac operon of Escherichia coli. In the absence of lactose, the constitutively expressed lac repressor protein binds to the <b>operator</b> <b>region</b> of the DNA and prevents the transcription of the operon genes. When present, lactose binds to the lac repressor, causing it to separate from the DNA and thereby enabling transcription to occur. Monod and Jacob generated this theory following 15 years of work by them and others (including Joshua Lederberg), partially as an explanation for Monod's observation of diauxie. Previously, Monod had hypothesized that enzymes could physically adapt themselves to new substrates; a series of experiments by him, Jacob, and Arthur Pardee eventually demonstrated this to be incorrect and led them to the modern theory, for which he and Jacob shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (together with André Lwoff).|$|E

5000|$|The lac {{repressor}} (LacI) operates by a helix-turn-helix motif in its DNA binding domain binding base-specifically to {{the major}} groove of the <b>operator</b> <b>region</b> of the lac operon, with base contacts also made by residues of symmetry-related alpha helices, the [...] "hinge" [...] helices, which bind deeply in the minor groove. This DNA binding causes the specific affinity of RNA polymerase for the promoter sequence to increase sufficiently that it cannot escape the promoter region and enter elongation, and so prevents transcription of the mRNA coding for the Lac proteins. When lactose is present, allolactose binds to the lac repressor, causing an allosteric change in its shape. In its changed state, the lac repressor is unable to bind tightly to its cognate operator. This effect {{is referred to as}} induction, because it induces, rather than represses, expression of the metabolic genes. In vitro, Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is a commonly used allolactose mimic which can be used to induce transcription of genes being regulated by lac repressor.|$|E
50|$|Single-molecule imaging is an imaging {{technique}} which provides an ideal resolution {{necessary for the}} study of the Transcription factor binding mechanism in living cells. In prokaryotic bacteria cells such as E. coli, facilitated diffusion is required in order for regulatory proteins to locate and bind to target sites on DNA base pairs. There are 2 main steps involved: the protein binds to a non-specific site on the DNA and then it diffuses along the DNA chain until it locates a target site, a process referred to as sliding. According to Brackley et al. (2013), during the process of protein sliding, the protein searches the entire length of the DNA chain using 3-D and 1-D diffusion patterns. During 3-D diffusion, the high incidence of Crowder proteins creates an osmotic pressure which brings searcher proteins (e.g. Lac Repressor) closer to the DNA to increase their attraction and enable them to bind, as well as steric effect which exclude the Crowder proteins from this region (Lac <b>operator</b> <b>region).</b> Blocker proteins participate in 1-D diffusion only i.e. bind to and diffuse along the DNA contour and not in the cytosol.|$|E

The binding of Cro to the three operator subsites is noncooperative and yields two discrete protein–DNA complexes of retarded migration in mobility shift assays.

The O 3 subsite overlaps the − 35 hexamer of the PL promoter, which directs cI expression.
