5|$|Just like glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs bind to and {{activate}} GR.

This type <b>of</b> <b>selective</b> GR activation should result in fewer side effects than the expected side effects that appear with a chronic treatment with classic glucocorticoids.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{proteasome}} normally produces {{very short}} peptide fragments, {{in some cases}} these products are themselves biologically active and functional molecules. Certain transcription factors regulating the expression of specific genes, including one component of the mammalian complex NF-κB, are synthesized as inactive precursors whose ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation converts them to an active form. Such activity requires the proteasome to cleave the substrate protein internally, rather than processively degrading it from one terminus. It {{has been suggested that}} long loops on these proteins' surfaces serve as the proteasomal substrates and enter the central cavity, while the majority of the protein remains outside. Similar effects have been observed in yeast proteins; this mechanism <b>of</b> <b>selective</b> degradation is known as regulated ubiquitin/proteasome dependent processing (RUP).|$|E
5|$|Domestic sheep are {{relatively}} small ruminants, usually with a crimped hair called wool and often with horns forming a lateral spiral. Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic as a result <b>of</b> <b>selective</b> breeding by humans. A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some {{of the characteristics of}} their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e. polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.|$|E

As an agronomist and farmer Himmler was acquainted with the principles <b>of</b> <b>selective</b> breeding, which he proposed to apply to humans. He believed that he could engineer the German populace, for example, through eugenics, to be Nordic in appearance within several decades {{of the end of}} the war.|$|E

5|$|Introduction {{of these}} quagga-like zebras {{could be part}} of a {{comprehensive}} restoration program including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and ostriches, which occurred together during historical times in a mutually beneficial association, could be kept together in areas where the indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third and fourth generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type <b>of</b> <b>selective</b> breeding is called breeding back. The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning does not yet exist.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of cholesteric liquid crystals {{can be controlled}} by light irradiation if conformationally photo-active molecules are present. Recently, control <b>of</b> the <b>selective</b> reflection band (spiral pitch) in nemato-chiral mixtures was demonstrated when photosensitive molecules, namely nematic azoxy-based compounds, were used as the host material. In this report, the investigation of light induced effects in cholesterics with azoxy-based host materials is continued to highlight the mechanisms of the response. Different non-photosensitive chiral materials were added to different azoxy-nematic liquid crystals and the pitch change caused by UV irradiation was investigated. A change in the pitch of 50 - 210 nm was observed depending on the exposure time {{and the intensity of}} the light. This effect is reversible: under illumination at wavelengths greater than 410 nm, the pitch shifts in the opposite direction. The dependence <b>of</b> the <b>selective</b> reflection band and the full-width-at-half-maximum of the band on the exposure time and the temperature dependence <b>of</b> the <b>selective</b> reflection band were investigated. The lowering of the phase transition temperature and narrowing of the width <b>of</b> the <b>selective</b> reflection band can be explained by a decrease in the orientational order parameter. The blue shift <b>of</b> the <b>selective</b> reflection band is due to a decrease in both the order parameter and the concentration of linear nematogenic molecules...|$|R
5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} protozoa such as Leishmania {{major and}} Trypanosoma cruzi lack the RNAi pathway entirely. Most {{or all of}} the components are also missing in some fungi, most notably the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of RNAi in other budding yeast species such as Saccharomyces castellii and Candida albicans, further demonstrates that inducing two RNAi-related proteins from S. castellii facilitates RNAi in S. cerevisiae. That certain ascomycetes and basidiomycetes are missing RNA interference pathways indicates that proteins required for RNA silencing have been lost independently from many fungal lineages, possibly due to the evolution of a novel pathway with similar function, or to the lack <b>of</b> <b>selective</b> advantage in certain niches.|$|E

5|$|Possession {{and use of}} {{psilocybin}} mushrooms, {{including the}} bluing species of Psilocybe, is therefore prohibited by extension. However, in many national, state, and provincial drug laws, {{there has been a}} great deal of ambiguity about the legal status of psilocybin mushrooms, as well as a strong element <b>of</b> <b>selective</b> enforcement in some places. Most US state courts have considered the mushroom a 'container' of the illicit drugs, and therefore illegal. A loophole further complicates the legal situation—the spores of psilocybin mushrooms do not contain the drugs, and are legal to possess in many areas. Jurisdictions that have specifically enacted or amended laws to criminalize the possession of psilocybin mushroom spores include Germany (since 1998), and California, Georgia, and Idaho in the United States. As a consequence, there is an active underground economy involved in the sale of spores and cultivation materials, and an internet-based social network to support the illicit activity.|$|E
5|$|When the U.S. 7th Cavalry {{accepted}} {{the surrender of}} Chief Joseph and the remaining Nez Perce, they immediately took more than 1,000 of the tribe's horses, sold what they could and shot many of the rest. But a significant population of horses {{had been left behind}} in the Wallowa valley when the Nez Perce began their retreat, and additional animals escaped or were abandoned along the way. The Nez Perce were ultimately settled on reservation lands in north central Idaho, were allowed few horses, and were required by the Army to crossbreed to draft horses in an attempt to create farm horses. The Nez Perce tribe never regained its former position as breeders of Appaloosas. In the late 20th century, they began a program to develop a new horse breed, the Nez Perce horse, with the intent to resurrect their horse culture, tradition <b>of</b> <b>selective</b> breeding, and horsemanship.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} the laser doping {{technique}} from a phosohorus glass layer as a dopant source was carried out.

The main laser parameters studied were the average power output and the pulse repetition frequency.

Regarding the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>selective</b> emitter solar cell the whole process was carried out.
