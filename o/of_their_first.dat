Buss initially agreed to seek a trade, but also worked to try to change Bryant's mind.|$|E
5|$|Several Acts of Parliament then followed. The Act in Conditional Restraint of Annates {{proposed}} that the clergy pay no more than 5% <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> year's revenue (annates) to Rome.

The family also tried unsuccessfully to engage in market gardening. To make more money, Jardine became a salesman with Cable & Wireless before working for a coal mining company in the late 1930s. In 1939, he returned to cricket journalism and according to Christopher Douglas, achieved his highest standard as a writer.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{marriage}} had been strained from the beginning, Teresa Cristina continued striving to {{be a good}} wife. Her constancy toward fulfilling her duty, along with the birth of children, softened PedroII's attitude. The two discovered shared interests, and their concern for and delight in their children created a sense of family happiness. That they were sexually active and compatible is witnessed by the series of pregnancies which ensued. After the birth <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> son in February 1845, the Empress bore children in July 1846, July 1847, and July 1848—named Afonso, Isabel, Leopoldina and Pedro, respectively.|$|E
