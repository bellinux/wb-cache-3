25|$|While {{reading the}} book Paul gave her, Connie finds his phone number inside. Connie calls Paul from Grand Central Station for his address, but he invites her over for coffee instead. Paul reads Connie a book in Braille amidst mild flirting. Connie, despite her {{feelings}} of attraction, leaves. Connie is unable to stop thinking about Paul, and decides to visit him {{with a bag of}} muffins. After Connie and Paul have a dance, she stops, saying she can't continue, and leaves. When she returns to retrieve her coat, Paul literally sweeps her off her feet and into his bed. While on the train ride home via the Metro-North Railroad, Connie, in tears, recalls their sexual encounter in flashbacks. She is thrilled by the sexual attention she is receiving from a younger man, but feels guilty at the same time. Connie uses her work for a charity event as an excuse to go into the city to visit Paul more frequently. Edward almost immediately senses something and sees subtle changes in her, which is confirmed by an inconsistency in an excuse she uses to visit the city one day. One morning he notices that Connie is fixing herself up to go into the city, with brand new shoes and lingerie draped <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> and he tells Connie he will wait for her so they can go into the city together. She urges him to go without her, that she won't be ready for quite a while, so he tries to get her to agree to meet him for lunch, but she says she has a salon appointment and won't be able to meet him. Later on, at the office, suspecting Connie is lying, Edward calls the salon she mentioned and it is confirmed that she doesn't have an appointment that day.|$|E
500|$|The {{front cover}} {{was shot by}} Phil Franks {{the day after the}} Basingstoke gig accident. Franks had already taken some photos from the Lyceum gig, but felt he needed {{something}} more for the front cover. The band showed up late having been in hospital earlier that day, and only 30 minutes were available for a shoot. Unable to get a satisfactory photo in the studio, Franks took the band round to his flat, grabbed a polystyrene mannequin head from a bin, put a 1,000 watt bulb in the kitchen light fitting, and improvised the shot. Franks credited the sleeve designer, Rolling Stone art director Jon Goodchild, for making the cover a success. When Yes performed a live version of [...] "Yours is No Disgrace" [...] for the German television series Beat-Club in April 1971, footage of the band was combined with that of another mannequin head spinning <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> mimicking the cover's concept.|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{condition}} declined precipitously in September. Keyboardist Tony Brown {{remembers the}} singer's arrival at a University of Maryland concert: [...] "He {{fell out of}} the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, Is the tour gonna happen?" [...] Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled, [...] "He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions". Wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in Detroit, [...] "I watched him in his dressing room, just draped <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> unable to move. So often I thought, 'Boss, why don't you just cancel this tour and take a year off...?' I mentioned something once in a guarded moment. He patted me on the back and said, 'It'll be all right. Don't you worry about it.'" [...] Presley continued to play to sellout crowds.|$|E

6000|$|Hilda Wade, with {{infinite}} sisterly tenderness, led her <b>over</b> to <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> by {{the window}} in the summer twilight, and took one quivering hand in hers.

6000|$|... (He tries {{various places}} and postures, {{and comes to}} rest leaning <b>over</b> <b>a</b> high <b>chair,</b> whence, in dumb show, he {{addresses}} a gathering. CRICHTON, with the best intentions, gives him a footstool to stand on, and departs, happily unconscious that ERNEST in some dudgeon has kicked the footstool across the room.) ...|$|R
2500|$|One of Lee's abiding beliefs {{was in the}} {{efficacy}} of corporal punishment {{in the form of}} caning. In his autobiography The Singapore Story he described his time at Raffles Institution in the 1930s, mentioning that he was caned there for chronic lateness by the then headmaster, D. W. McLeod. He wrote: [...] "I bent <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> and was given three of the best with my trousers on. I did not think he lightened his strokes. I have never understood why Western educationists are so much against corporal punishment. It did my fellow students and me no harm." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fisher's father {{ultimately}} aided his {{entry into}} the navy, via his godmother Lady Horton, widow of the governor of Ceylon to whom William Fisher had been Aide-de-camp. She prevailed upon a neighbour, Admiral Sir William Parker (the last of Nelson's captains), to nominate John as a naval cadet. The entry examination consisted of writing out the Lord's Prayer and jumping naked <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair.</b> He formally entered the Royal Navy on 13 July 1854, aged 13, on board Nelson's former flagship, , at Portsmouth. On 29 July he joined , an old ship of the line. She was built of wood, in 1831, with 84 smooth-bore muzzle-loading guns arranged on two gun decks, and relied entirely on sail for propulsion. She had a crew of 700, and discipline was strictly enforced by the [...] "hard-bitten Captain Stopford". Fisher fainted when he witnessed eight men being flogged on his first day.|$|E

500|$|Following Palmer's {{death in}} 2016, the 2017 {{ceremony}} featured tributes; his green jacket was draped <b>over</b> <b>an</b> empty white <b>chair,</b> while everyone in attendance wore [...] "Arnie's Army" [...] badges.|$|R

25|$|The {{governing}} {{body of a}} district is the twice-yearly synod. Each district is presided <b>over</b> by <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> except the large London District which has three <b>chairs.</b> <b>A</b> <b>chair</b> was, at first, a superintendent of a circuit within the district, but now ministers are appointed exclusively to the role. The prime function of the chair is pastoralâ€”the care of ministers, and lay workers, and their families, within the district; the appointment of ministers to circuits; candidates for the ministry and the oversight of probationer (trainee) ministers. The district chair will also be the person to whom churches of other denominations relate ecumenically at regional or national level.|$|R

50|$|In 1998, Goodman {{went to the}} World Swimming Championships in Perth, but overbalanced {{and fell}} into the pool during the final. He was deemed to have entered the water {{deliberately}} and was disqualified for a false start. Goodman reacted by throwing and knocking <b>over</b> <b>a</b> poolside <b>chair</b> {{as he left the}} arena. Devastated, he quit swimming, but resumed training in 1999 in order to attempt to qualify for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. He failed to gain selection for the Sydney Olympics.|$|R
5000|$|A Syrian TV series {{entitled}} Hamam al-Hana (1968) {{is based}} on the premise of this novel. It involves three guys looking for the hidden treasure (a stash of money) all <b>over</b> Damascus, with <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> for every episode. In the last episode, they find the right chair, but the treasure turns out to be old paper money which by then had become useless.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you please}} {{to take the}} {{privilege}} o' sitting down, Miss," [...] said Mrs. Jakin, rubbing her apron <b>over</b> <b>a</b> perfectly clean <b>chair,</b> and then lifting up the corner of that garment and holding it to her face {{with an air of}} embarrassment, as she looked wonderingly at Maggie.|$|R

50|$|According to the Mahavamsa, Vijaya {{landed on}} Sri Lanka near Mahathitha (Manthota or Mannar), and named {{on the island}} of Thambaparni ("copper-colored sand"). This name is attested to in Ptolemy's map of the ancient world. The Mahavamsa also {{describes}} the Buddha visiting Sri Lanka three times. Firstly, to stop a war between a Naga king and his son in law who were fighting <b>over</b> <b>a</b> ruby <b>chair.</b> It is said that on his last visit he left his foot mark on Siripada ("Adam's Peak").|$|R
50|$|The work {{depicts a}} woman sitting on white towels spread <b>over</b> <b>a</b> wicker <b>chair,</b> {{with her back}} to the viewer. Her body is arched and {{slightly}} twisted, creating a tension in her back, accentuated by the deep line of her backbone. One hand dries her neck with a towel, presumably after getting out of the tin bath in the corner of the room. The other arm leans out to hold onto the chair for support. The space is defined by the vertical and diagonal lines where the floor and walls meet.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a singing}} {{convention}} (that is, a full-scale, usually annual gathering of singers), {{the forms of}} parliamentary procedure are adhered to, usually in an informal way that uses little time. The convention is presided <b>over</b> by <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> and there are committees, resolutions, and so on. Among the committees is an arranging committee, whose task is described in the [...] "Rudiments" [...] section of The Sacred Harp as follows: it [...] "identifies leaders and calls on them to lead, often giving notice to the next leader as well." [...] In modern times, arranging committees distribute the task of leading widely among the singers, so that {{in all but the}} largest conventions, everyone who wishes to lead gets a chance; see below for historical practice.|$|R
6000|$|All {{this was}} {{astonishing}} enough. But what puzzled Mrs. Griggs completely {{was the fact}} that a woman's dress was hanging <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> before the mirror--a pale blue, silken affair. And on the floor beside it were two little blue satin slippers! ...|$|E

60|$|Although Lily Dallam had {{declared}} that {{to leave her}} house before midnight was to insult her, it was half-past eleven when Honora and her husband reached home. He halted smilingly in her doorway as {{she took off her}} wrap and laid it <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nevill {{was found}} in the kitchen, dressed in pyjamas, lying <b>over</b> <b>an</b> {{overturned}} <b>chair</b> next to the fireplace, amid a scene suggestive of a struggle. He had been shot eight times, six times to the head and face, fired when the rifle was a few inches from his skin. The remaining shots to his body had occurred from at least two feet away. Based on where the empty cartridges were foundâ€”three in the kitchen and one on the stairsâ€”the police concluded that he had been shot four times upstairs, but had managed to get downstairs where a struggle took place, and during which he was hit several times with the rifle and shot again, this time fatally.|$|R
6000|$|For {{the rest}} of the evening the silent {{presence}} in the room above affected the household; the half-curious servants and ranch hands spoke in whispers in the passages, and at evening prayers, in the dining room, Seth Rivers, kneeling before and bowed <b>over</b> <b>a</b> rush-bottomed <b>chair</b> whose legs were clutched by his strong hands, included [...] "the stranger within our gates" [...] in his regular supplications. When the hour for retiring came, Seth, with a candle in his hand, preceded his wife up the staircase, but stopped before the door of their guest's room. [...] "I reckon," [...] he said interrogatively to Mrs. Rivers, [...] "I oughter see ef he's wantin' anythin'?" ...|$|R
5000|$|If {{we have a}} {{goal that}} is {{currently}} unsatisfied, {{it will be more}} prominent in our minds than a goal that has already been accomplished. Thus, if a protagonist has a goal that has not yet been accomplished, that goal should be more accessible to those who comprehend than a goal that was just accomplished by the protagonist. In line with this prediction, goals yet to be accomplished by the protagonist were recognized more quickly than goals that were just accomplished. We are often able to predict peopleâ€™s future actions by inferring their goals. For example, when we see <b>a</b> man walking <b>over</b> to <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> we assume that he wants to sit, especially when he has been standing for a long time. Thus, we might generate the inference, â€œHe is going to sit." ...|$|R
