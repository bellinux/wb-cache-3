5|$|The {{difficult}} {{habitat and}} retiring nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invisible</b> rail mean that information on its lifestyle is sparse, {{and there are}} few confirmed sightings. Recorded food items include sago shoots and insects. It also feeds at cut sago plants, although {{it is unclear whether}} it is eating the decaying plant or searching for other edible items. It swallows small stones, as do all rails, to help break up its food in the gizzard.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{species with}} a {{restricted}} range {{are especially vulnerable}} to human activities, and eight of the 26 bird species occurring only in the Northern Maluku Endemic Bird Area are threatened, including the invisible rail. Almost {{a quarter of all}} rail species have conservation concerns, and flightless island species are particularly at risk, at least 15 species having become extinct since 1600. The estimated population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invisible</b> rail is 3,500–15,000 birds, and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although this rail is so poorly known that it may be more common than the estimates suggest.|$|E
5|$|Smith, {{a philosopher}} who forged the new {{discipline}} of economics, is, by contrast, depicted in contemporary attire, showing {{his concern for}} the practical matters of economic activity, a gown draped over his shoulder retains the connection to philosophy and academia. Smith's economic ideas are also encoded into the statue: the plough behind him represents the agrarian economics he supplanted, the beehive before, {{is a symbol of}} the industry he predicted would come. His hand, resting on a globe, is obscured by the gown: a literal presentation of Smith's famous metaphor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invisible</b> hand. The life-and-a-half size statue of Smith, is cast in bronze from a plaster model by the sculptor and was unveiled in 2008. It was funded by private subscriptions organised by the Adam Smith Institute.|$|E

50|$|Castlevania {{often has}} enemies and bosses that refer to old {{literature}} and films.

His clothes (before he discards them to stalk players unseen) reference those in <b>the</b> novel <b>The</b> <b>Invisible</b> Man: he wears a long, thick, tall-collared coat, gloves, and a wide-brimmed hat. He also dies in a similar fashion.|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} folk {{tales of the}} Tylwyth Teg, the fairy people who {{inhabited}} the area and an invisible land in Cardigan Bay. One tells of a farmer from Aberdaron {{who was in the}} habit of stepping outside his house before retiring to bed. One night he was spoken to by a stranger, who asked why the farmer was annoyed by him. The farmer, confused, asked what the stranger meant and was told to stand with one foot on the stranger's. This he did, and could see another house, just below his own, and that all the farm's slops went down the chimney <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invisible</b> house. The stranger asked if the farmer would move his door {{to the other side of}} the house, which the farmer subsequently did, walling up the original door; from that day, the farmer's livestock flourished, and he became one of the most prosperous men in the area.|$|E

25|$|Cotton Mather's The Wonders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Invisible</b> World {{was written}} {{with the purpose}} to show how careful the court was in {{managing}} the trials. Unfortunately the work did not get released until after the trials had already ended. In his book, Mather explained how he felt spectral evidence was presumptive and that it alone {{was not enough to}} warrant a conviction. Robert Calef, a strong critic of Cotton Mather, stated in his own book titled More Wonders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Invisible</b> World that by confessing an accused would not be brought to trial, such in the cases of Tituba and Dorcas Good.|$|E

50|$|AC Her is also {{a binary}} star, {{although}} the secondary can only be detected by its effect on <b>the</b> radial velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary. <b>The</b> <b>invisible</b> secondary is more massive than the supergiant primary, so the primary moves at relatively high velocity in its three years and three months orbit.

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} assess whether or not rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) could represent <b>the</b> unperceived movements <b>of</b> a stimulus. Subjects were tested on 2 computerized tasks, HOLE (monkeys) and LASER (humans and monkeys), in which subjects needed to chase or shoot at, respectively, a moving target that either remained visible or became invisible {{for a portion of}} its path of movement. Response patterns were analyzed and compared between target-visible and target-invisible conditions. Results of Experiments 1, 2, and 3 demonstrated that the monkeys are capable of extrapolating movement. That this extrapolation involved internal representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target's <b>invisible</b> movement was suggested but not confirmed. Experiment 4, however, demonstrated that the monkeys are capable <b>of</b> representing <b>the</b> <b>invisible</b> displacements <b>of</b> a stimulus...|$|R

25|$|K9 was {{the brainchild}} of writers Bob Baker and Dave Martin.

Martin's own dog had also been recently run over by a car, and K9 was a car-proof tribute to it.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the second}} {{generation}} of New England settlers, Cotton Mather stands out as a theologian and historian, who wrote {{the history of the}} colonies with a view to God's activity in their midst and to connecting the Puritan leaders with the great heroes of the Christian faith.

50|$|H. G. Wells wrote <b>The</b> <b>Invisible</b> Man (1897) {{which was}} the first science fiction novel to explore <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> invisibility. <b>The</b> <b>invisible</b> man is a {{scientist}} named Griffin who theorizes that if a person's refractive index is changed to exactly that of air and his body does not absorb or reflect light, then he will not be visible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but cannot become visible again, leading to mental instability.|$|R
50|$|His portraits {{emphasize}} what is within, unmarked {{by gender}} or cultural identity. Like El Greco, {{one of his}} artistic references, he seeks <b>the</b> transcendental essence <b>of</b> being. In 1955, he abandons all description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world in order to focus on <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> transforming <b>the</b> <b>invisible</b> to visible. He considers that painting allows for true knowledge <b>of</b> oneself, with <b>the</b> projection <b>of</b> raw material.|$|R
2500|$|Bolland's style {{includes}} the initial 'rough' outline stage, {{making it easy}} for the publisher (and, in some cases, the writer) to [...] "sign off" [...] on his designs.

25|$|The pair {{looked to}} close England's lead, but again the England bowlers intervened – {{this time in}} the shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invisible</b> man in England's attack, Simon Jones, who got plenty of reverse swing and used that to trap Langer with a yorker – gone for 82, which was to be Australia's highest score in the innings. Australia's tail – thought to be {{strengthened}} by the absence of McGrath, were all dismissed for single-figure scores, Andrew Flintoff taking the two last men lbw with the two last balls, although there was some argument about the first dismissal.|$|E
25|$|Although, in Cuba, many composers {{have written}} both {{classical}} and popular creole types of music, the distinction became clearer after 1960, when (at least initially) the regime frowned on popular music and closed {{most of the}} night-club venues, whilst providing financial support for classical music rather than creole forms. From then on most musicians have kept their careers on one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invisible</b> line or the other. After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, {{a new crop of}} classical musicians came onto the scene. The most important of these is guitarist Leo Brouwer, who made significant innovations in classical guitar, and is currently the director of the Havana Symphonic Orchestra. His directorship in the early 1970s of the Cuban Institute of Instrumental and Cinematographic Arts (ICAIC) was instrumental in the formation and consolidation of the nueva trova movement.|$|E
25|$|When it was rediscovered by officialdom in 1785, {{the site}} was known to the local Totonac, whose {{ancestors}} may also have built the city, as El Tajín, which was said to mean “of thunder or lightning bolt”. Related to this is their belief that twelve old thunderstorm deities, known as Tajín, still inhabit the ruins. However, a series of indigenous maps dating {{from the time of}} the Spanish conquest, found in nearby Tihuatlan and now known as the Lienzos de Tuxpan, suggest that the city might then have been called “Mictlan” or “place of the dead”, a common denomination for ancient sites whose original names have been lost. This name also appears in the Matricula de Tributos, a surviving Aztec tribute record, which later formed part of the Codex Mendoza. This may therefore be linked to another Totonac meaning claimed for El Tajín: “place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>invisible</b> beings or spirits”.|$|E
50|$|Bed bug infestations spread {{easily in}} {{connecting}} units and have {{negative effects on}} psychological well-being and housing markets. In response, many areas have specific laws about responsibilities upon discovering a bed bug infestation, particularly in hotels and multi-family housing units, because an unprofessional level of response can have <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> prolonging <b>the</b> <b>invisible</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infestation and spreading it to nearby units.|$|R
