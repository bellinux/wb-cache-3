5|$|The {{conscription}} law of World War I {{provided for}} noncombatant service {{for members of}} a religious organization whose members were forbidden from participating in war of any form. This exemption effectively limited conscientious <b>objector</b> status {{to members of the}} historic peace churches: Mennonites (and other Anabaptist groups such as Hutterites), Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and Church of the Brethren. The law gave the President authority to assign such draftees to any noncombatant military role.|$|E
5|$|Waters {{was born}} on 6 September 1943, the younger of two boys, to Mary (née Whyte; 1913–2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1914–1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey. His father, {{the son of a}} coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, a devout Christian, and a Communist Party member. In {{the early years of the}} Second World War, his father was a {{conscientious}} <b>objector</b> who drove an ambulance during the Blitz.|$|E
5|$|West Point was {{not immune}} to the social {{upheaval}} of American society during the Vietnam War. The first woman joined {{the faculty of the}} all-male institution amidst controversy in 1968. The Army granted its first honorable discharge in 1971 to a West Point cadet, Cary E. Donham, of Illinois, who applied for conscientious <b>objector</b> status in 1970. The academy struggled to fill its incoming classes as its graduates led troops in Southeast Asia, where 333 graduates died.|$|E
25|$|The {{group was}} {{organized}} as National Council for Religious Conscientious <b>Objectors</b> on October 5, 1940 {{by the three}} historic peace churches {{in response to the}} Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, which introduced the first peacetime draft in the United States. The Selective Service Act provided for work of national importance and an alternative to military service for conscientious <b>objectors.</b> The immediate task of this group was to advise conscientious <b>objectors</b> and create a structure for the proposed alternative service. On November 26, 1940, National Council for Religious Conscientious <b>Objectors</b> was merged with a similar organization, Civilian Service Board to become National Service Board for Religious <b>Objectors</b> (NSBRO).|$|R
50|$|During September 1989, thirty Stellenbosch {{conscientious}} <b>objectors</b> joined {{more than}} 700 listed COs nationwide by publicly refusing to do military service. The National Registry of Conscientious <b>Objectors</b> was also launched.|$|R
50|$|In some countries, {{conscientious}} <b>objectors</b> {{are assigned}} to an alternative civilian service {{as a substitute for}} conscription or military service.

5|$|Garfield co-produced {{and starred}} in the 2014 {{independent}} drama 99 Homes. He also headlined Martin Scorsese's 2016 film Silence based on Shūsaku Endō's 1966 novel of the same name. Production began in 2014 with Garfield set to play Father Rodrigues, a Portuguese Jesuit priest {{in the seventeenth century}} who travels to Japan. By November 2014, it was also confirmed that Garfield would join the cast of Hacksaw Ridge, a war drama about Desmond Doss, a Seventh-Day Adventist Christian and the first conscientious <b>objector</b> in US history to be awarded the Medal of Honor. The film was released in November 2016; Mel Gibson directed and Garfield starred alongside Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington.|$|E
5|$|Pinter {{was born}} and raised in Hackney, east London, and educated at Hackney Downs School. He was a {{sprinter}} and a keen cricket player, acting in school plays and writing poetry. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art but did not complete the course. He was fined for refusing National service as a conscientious <b>objector.</b> Subsequently, he continued training at the Central School of Speech and Drama and worked in repertory theatre in Ireland and England. In 1956 he married actress Vivien Merchant and had a son, Daniel, born in 1958. He left Merchant in 1975 and married author Lady Antonia Fraser in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Gibson directed, co-wrote and {{produced}} The Passion of the Christ in 2004, a Biblical epic drama which chronicled the Passion of Jesus. On its release, the film garnered mixed reviews {{as well as}} notoriety for its graphic violence and alleged undertones of antisemitism from critics. Nevertheless, it grossed $370.3 million in the United States and $611.4 million worldwide, making it Gibson's highest-grossing film to date. Two years later he directed, co-wrote {{and produced}} Apocalypto, an epic adventure set in Central America depicting {{the last days of}} Mayan civilization before Spanish arrival in the 16th century. Gibson then took a ten-year hiatus from directing during which time he landed roles in Edge of Darkness (2010), Machete Kills (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Blood Father (2016). He directed Hacksaw Ridge in 2016, a biographical war drama focusing on American World War II veteran Desmond Doss, the first conscientious <b>objector</b> to receive the Medal of Honor. The film garnered praise from critics and audiences alike, as well as various accolades.|$|E

2500|$|Paxman was criticised for his {{presentation}} of the BBC documentary [...] "Britain's Great War". While describing how British conscientious <b>objectors</b> were jailed and threatened with the death penalty because killing was against their beliefs, Paxman ventured his own opinion {{that it was the}} <b>objectors</b> themselves who were at fault, and that they were [...] "extreme". The conscientious <b>objectors,</b> Paxman said, [...] "have always struck me as cranks." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{records of}} {{conscientious}} <b>objectors</b> to military service are kept by a governmental investigative body as criminal files for five years. As a consequence, conscientious <b>objectors</b> {{are not allowed}} to enter a government office and apply for any type of national certification exam. It is also very unlikely that they will be employed by any company that inquires about criminal records. Conscientious <b>objectors</b> ... often spend {{the rest of their lives}} tainted by their decision... Criminal records from draft dodging make it difficult for <b>objectors</b> to find good jobs and the issue of army service is often raised by potential employers during job interviews.|$|R
5000|$|She worked {{helped to}} rally {{support for the}} anti-conscription {{movement}} by the late 1980s. South African young white males began to question their mandatory military service and increasingly saw it as an immoral war to defend apartheid. Cross helped almost 2000 young men apply for military conscription exclusion to the Board for Religious <b>Objectors.</b> Many more left South Africa to avoid the forced military service. Their numbers steadily increased {{by the end of}} the decade. In 1987, there were 23 conscientious <b>objectors.</b> The number of <b>objectors</b> rose to 143 in 1988 and increased very rapidly in 1989, reaching a high of 771 <b>objectors.</b>|$|R

25|$|Summers' {{brother had}} {{enlisted in the}} United States Army at the {{beginning}} of World War II. But Summers, opposed to the use of force, declared himself a conscientious <b>objector.</b> The Illinois State Bar Association admitted he was of high moral character and exhibited excellent knowledge of the law, but denied him admission in 1942 due to his conscientious <b>objector</b> status. In a highly controversial but important decision, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the denial of admission to the bar in In re Summers, 325 U.S. 561 (1945). Summers later was admitted to the New York State Bar Association.|$|E
5000|$|In 1984 the Congreso de los Diputados {{passed a}} law on {{conscientious}} objection, which recognised the rights of <b>objectors,</b> establishing a civilian service of 18 months, called [...] "Prestación Social Sustitutoria" [...] (Substitutionary Social Service, PSS), {{as an alternative to}} 12 months compulsory military service. The previous <b>objectors</b> were then amnestied and freed from military obligations. A few of them, however, considered that the longer duration of the PSS penalised <b>objectors,</b> amounted to forced labour, and deprived ordinary workers of jobs; they demanded complete abolition of military service. Those <b>objectors</b> therefore rejected the amnesty and returned to Spain apparently ready to be called up.|$|R

50|$|The Central Committee for Conscientious <b>Objectors</b> (CCCO) was a United States nonprofit {{organization}} dedicated to helping people avoid or resist military conscription or seek discharge after voluntary enlistment. It was active in supporting conscientious <b>objectors</b> ("CO's"), war resisters and draft evaders during the Vietnam War. Founded in Philadelphia in 1948 and dissolved in 2011, CCCO emphasized the needs of secular and activist COs, while other organizations supporting COs principally focused on religious <b>objectors</b> and/or legislative reform and government relations.|$|R

25|$|On June 28, 1971, the Supreme Court of the United States in Clay v. United States {{overturned}} Ali's conviction by {{a unanimous}} 8–0 decision (Justice Thurgood Marshall recused himself, {{as he had}} been the U.S. Solicitor General at the time of Ali's conviction). The decision was not based on, nor did it address, the merits of Ali's claims per se; rather, the Court held that since the appeal board gave no reason for the denial of a conscientious <b>objector</b> exemption to Ali, and that it was therefore impossible to determine which of the three basic tests for conscientious <b>objector</b> status offered in the Justice Department's brief that the appeal board relied on, Ali's conviction must be reversed.|$|E
25|$|In World War I, {{conscientious}} <b>objector</b> status did not exempt {{one from}} military duty.

In November 1917, while York's application was considered, he was drafted and began his army service at Camp Gordon in Georgia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{conscription}} legislation {{introduced the}} right to refuse military service, allowing for conscientious <b>objectors</b> to be absolutely exempted, to perform alternative civilian service, or {{to serve as a}} non-combatant in the army, according {{to the extent to which}} they could convince a Military Service Tribunal of the quality of their objection. Around 16,500 men were recorded as conscientious <b>objectors,</b> with Quakers playing a large role. 4,500 <b>objectors</b> were sent to work on farms to undertake [...] "work of national importance", 7,000 were ordered non-combatant duties as stretcher bearers, but 6,000 were forced into the army, and when they refused orders, they were sent to prison, as in the case of the Richmond Sixteen.Some 843 conscientious <b>objectors</b> spent more than two years in prison; ten died while there, seventeen were initially given the death penalty (but received life imprisonment) and 142 were imprisoned on life sentences.
