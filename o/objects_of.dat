5|$|Allocators are {{required}} to supply a template class member template [CODE] which enables the possibility of obtaining a related allocator, parameterized {{in terms of a}} different type. For example, given an allocator type IntAllocator for <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> type int, a related allocator type for <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> type long could be obtained using IntAllocator::rebind::other.|$|E
5|$|Allocators {{should be}} copy-constructible. An {{allocator}} for <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> type T {{can be constructed}} from an allocator for <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> type U. If an allocator, A, allocates a region of memory, R, then R can only be deallocated by an allocator that compares equal to A.|$|E

5|$|An allocator, A, for <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> type T {{must have}} a member {{function}} with the signature A::pointer A::allocate(size_type n, A::const_pointer hint = 0). This function returns a pointer to the first element of a newly allocated array large enough to contain n <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> type T; only the memory is allocated, and the objects are not constructed. Moreover, an optional pointer argument (that points to an object already allocated by A) {{can be used as}} a hint to the implementation about where the new memory should be allocated in order to improve locality. However, the implementation is free to ignore the argument.|$|E

5|$|In an earlier, more celebrated case, Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1968), a {{group of}} farmers pressed the Milk Marketing Board to {{increase}} the prices for milk payable to them, but the Board refused. The farmers complained to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food under section 19(3) of the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958. Under the section, the Minister had power to direct that a complaint be considered by the Committee of Investigation {{but he refused to}} exercise the statutory power and provided no reasons for his refusal. The farmers alleged misconduct on Minister's part. The House of Lords held that a minister's power under an Act is not unfettered, and that the Minister in question had effectively frustrated the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> the statute as his non-exercise of the power had been based on a misunderstanding of the purpose for which the power was given to him. Parliament must have conferred the discretion with the intention that it should be used to promote the policy and <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> the Act, and the Minister could not act so as to frustrate the policy and <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> the Act.|$|E
