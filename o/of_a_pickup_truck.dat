5|$|As Galván left a Farmacia Guadalajara {{drugstore}} {{near his}} home in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, on the evening of 27 February 2014, he was kidnapped along with businessman Miguel Ángel Ortiz. His vehicle was discovered abandoned with open doors in the pharmacy's parking lot by his wife. The following day, a disfigured corpse found in the trunk <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pickup</b> <b>truck</b> in the town of García, Nuevo León, was taken to the hospital of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León. After more than a month of forensic examination, experts officially identified the corpse as that of Galván on 31 March 2014. Post-mortem reports concluded that Galván had been tortured before being killed with a coup de grâce. The exact location of Galván's murder remains unknown, although authorities tend to believe he was most likely killed in Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 1976, as Fox {{was driving}} to the family home at Morrill Street in Port Coquitlam, he became distracted by nearby bridge construction, and crashed into the back <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pickup</b> <b>truck.</b> While his car was left undriveable, Fox emerged with only a sore right knee. He again felt pain in December, but chose to ignore it {{until the end of}} {{basketball}} season. By March 1977, the pain had intensified and he finally went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of cancer that often starts near the knees. Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee and left it vulnerable to the disease, though his doctors argued there was no connection. He was told that his leg had to be amputated, he would require chemotherapy treatment, and that recent medical advances meant he had a 50-percent chance of survival. Fox learned that two years before, the figure would have been only 15 percent; the improvement in survival rates impressed on him the value of cancer research.|$|E

25|$|The {{fifth wheel}} {{coupling}} provides a pivoting link between a semi-trailer and the towing truck, tractor unit, leading trailer or dolly. Some recreational vehicles have a fifth wheel configuration, requiring the coupling to be installed in the bed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pickup</b> <b>truck</b> as a towing vehicle. The coupling consists of a coupling pin (or kingpin) {{on the front of}} the semi-trailer, and a horseshoe-shaped coupling device called a fifth wheel on the rear of the towing vehicle. In 1911, Charles Martin invented the fifth wheel coupler consisting of a round plate with a hole in it, attached to a frame mounted on his tractor.|$|E

It was later retrieved from the trash after Rader asked {{what had become of}} it in a later message. Surveillance tape of the parking lot from that date revealed a distant figure driving a black Jeep Cherokee leaving the box in the pickup. In February, more postcards were sent to KAKE, and another cereal box left at a rural location was found to contain another bound doll, apparently meant to symbolize the murder of 11-year-old Josephine Otero.|$|E
25|$|After {{playing a}} show in Norfolk, Virginia, on March 21, 1956, the Perkins Brothers Band headed to New York City for a March 24 {{appearance}} on NBC-TV's Perry Como Show.

After hitting the back <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pickup</b> <b>truck,</b> their car went into a ditch containing about a foot of water, and Perkins was left lying {{face down in the}} water. Drummer Holland rolled Perkins over, saving him from drowning. He had sustained three fractured vertebrae in his neck, a severe concussion, a broken collar bone, and lacerations all over his body in the crash. Perkins remained unconscious for an entire day. The driver of the pickup truck, Thomas Phillips, a 40-year-old farmer, died when he was thrown into the steering wheel. Jay Perkins had a fractured neck and severe internal injuries; he never fully recovered and died in 1958.|$|E

Damages to crops amounted to $3million. In addition to the flooding rains produced by Delia, eight tornadoes also touched down due to the storm, injuring four people. Five people were killed during Delia, two of which were directly related to the storm. Two of the other deaths resulted from a car crash, triggered by slick roads, with the two occupants <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pickup</b> <b>truck</b> being killed.

500|$|Some {{scenes in}} Boys Don't Cry {{required}} {{emotional and physical}} intensity; these were allocated extended periods of filming. The scene in which Brandon, at the wishes of his friends, bumper-skis on the back <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pickup</b> <b>truck,</b> was delayed when a police officer, just arriving at a shift change, required a large lighting crane to be moved {{from one side of}} the road to the other. The scenes took six hours to shoot and were filmed at sunrise, resulting in a blue sky being seen in the background. There were some technical complications: some of the filming equipment got stuck in mud, and radio wires in some of the scenes conflicted with the sound production. Swank required a stunt double for a scene in which she falls off the back of a truck. Teena's rape scene was given an extended filming time; Sexton, who portrayed one of the attackers, walked away in tears afterward. Swank found portraying her character daunting and felt the need to [...] "keep a distance" [...] from the reality of the actual event. When scenes became difficult, Swank requested the company of her husband on set. At times, Peirce worked for seventeen hours a day in order to complete more work, but the other crew members told her that this was taking up potential nighttime filming hours.|$|E
