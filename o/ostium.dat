5|$|Some {{evidence}} of early evolutionary {{history is the}} structure of the antennal heart, a separate circulatory organ consisting of two ampullae, or vesicles, that are attached to the frontal cuticle to the bases of the antennae. These features have not been found in other insects. An independent organ exists for each antenna, consisting of an ampulla, attached to the frontal cuticle medial to the antenna base and forming a thin-walled sac with a valved <b>ostium</b> on its ventral side. They pump blood by elastic connective tissue, rather than muscle.|$|E
5|$|Fish ovaries may be {{of three}} types: gymnovarian, {{secondary}} gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then enter the <b>ostium,</b> then through the oviduct and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct. Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in lungfish, sturgeon, and bowfin. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct. Secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonids {{and a few other}} teleosts.|$|E
25|$|A {{defect in}} the <b>ostium</b> primum is {{occasionally}} classified as an atrial septal defect, {{but it is more}} commonly classified as an atrioventricular septal defect. <b>Ostium</b> primum defects are less common than <b>ostium</b> secundum defects. This type of defect is usually associated with Down syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ostium</b> secundum atrial septal defect is {{the most}} common type of atrial septal defect, and {{comprises}} 6–10% of all congenital heart diseases.|$|E
25|$|The parts {{outside this}} cord remain separate, and each forms the {{corresponding}} Fallopian tube. The <b>ostium</b> of the fallopian tube remains from the anterior extremity {{of the original}} tubular invagination from the abdominal cavity.|$|E
25|$|In the male, by {{the greater}} {{growth of the}} pelvic portion of the cloaca, a longer urethra is formed, and the {{primitive}} opening is carried forward with the phallus, but it still ends at the corona glandis. Later, this opening, which {{is located on the}} dorsal side of the penis, closes from behind forward. Meanwhile, the urethral plate of the glans breaks down centrally to form a median groove continuous with the primitive <b>ostium.</b> This groove also closes from behind forward, leaving only a small pipe running {{in the middle of the}} penis. Thus, the urogenital opening is shifted forward to the end of the glans.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{formation}} of the Wolffian ducts a second pair of ducts is developed; these are the Müllerian ducts. Each arises on the lateral aspect of the corresponding Wolffian duct as a tubular invagination of the cells lining the abdominal cavity. The orifice of the invagination remains open, and undergoes enlargement and modification to form the abdominal <b>ostium</b> of the fallopian tube. The ducts pass backward lateral to the Wolffian ducts, but toward the posterior end of the embryo they cross to the medial side of these ducts, and thus come to lie side by side between and behind the latter—the four ducts forming what is termed the common genital cord, to distinguish it from the genital cords of the germinal epithelium seen later in this article. The Müllerian ducts end in an epithelial elevation, the Müllerian eminence, on the ventral part of the cloaca between the orifices of the Wolffian ducts. At a later stage the eminence opens in the middle, connecting the Müllerian ducts with the cloaca.|$|E
500|$|Hepialidae have short, {{pectinate}} antennae and, unusually primitive for Lepidoptera, lack {{a functional}} proboscis or retinaculum {{and are therefore}} non-feeding. [...] The moths possess several other morphological features that are considered phylogenetically primitive. [...] The gap between the fore- and hindwing is distinct and the wings are covered in scale-like hairs. [...] At {{the base of the}} forewing is a jugum, a small lobe that joins the fore- and hindwings during flight. [...] In females, the configuration of the genitalia is exoporian, typified by an external groove along which spermatophores are transferred after mating, from the copulatory opening (the <b>ostium</b> bursae), to the ovipore for fertilisation.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the fourth}} week, a crest grows that leaves the cephalic part. This crest is {{the first part of the}} septum primum. The two ends of the septum extend into the {{interior}} of the endocardial cushions in the atrioventricular canal. The opening between the bottom edge of the septum primum and endocardial cushions is the <b>ostium</b> primum (first opening). The extensions of the upper and lower endocardial pads grow along the margin of the septum primum and close the <b>ostium</b> primum. Coalescence of these perforations will form the <b>ostium</b> secundum (second opening), which allows blood to flow freely from the right atrium to the left.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>ostium</b> secundum ASD [...] {{accompanied}} by an acquired mitral valve stenosis is called Lutembacher's syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>ostium</b> secundum atrial septal defect {{accounts}} for 7% of all congenital heart lesions. [...] This lesion shows a male:female ratio of 1:2.|$|E
2500|$|The secundum atrial septal defect usually {{arises from}} an {{enlarged}} foramen ovale, inadequate {{growth of the}} septum secundum, or excessive absorption of the septum primum. [...] About 10 to 20% of individuals with <b>ostium</b> secundum ASDs also have mitral valve prolapse.|$|E
2500|$|The family Hepialidae is {{considered}} to be very primitive, with a number of structural differences to other moths including very short antennae and the lack of a functional proboscis or frenulum (see Kristensen, 1999: 61-62 for details). Like other Exoporia the sperm is transferred to the egg by an external channel between the <b>ostium</b> and the ovipore. Other nonditrysian moths have a common cloaca. The moths are homoneurous with similar forewings and hindwings, and are sometimes included as 'honorary' members of the Macrolepidoptera, though archaic they are. Strictly speaking, they are phylogenetically too basal and constitute Microlepidoptera, although hepialids range from very small moths to a wingspan record of 250mm in Zelotypia. Because of their sometimes large size and striking colour patterns, they have received more popular and taxonomic attention than most [...] "micros". Many species display strong sexual dimorphism, with males smaller but more boldly marked than females, or at high elevation, females of Pharmacis and Aoraia show [...] "brachypterous" [...] wing reduction.|$|E

60|$|Quibus factis juravit se patrem tuum quoque immortalem ostensuram esse, si me prius occisa regine contubernium mallet; neque enim ipsa me occidere valuit, propter nostratum magicam cujus egomet partem habeo. Ille vero nichil hujus generis malebat, manibus ante oculos passis, ne mulieris formositatem adspiceret: postea illum magica percussit arte, at mortuum efferebat inde cum fletibus et vagitibus, et me per timorem expulit ad <b>ostium</b> magni fluminis, velivoli, porro in nave, in qua te peperi, vix post dies huc Athenas vecta sum. At tu, O Tisisthenes, ne quid quorum mando nauci fac: necesse enim est mulierem exquirere si qua Vite mysterium impetres et vindicare, quautum in te est, patrem tuum Callieratem in regine morte.

60|$|Factumque est ut præceperat illis. Sed, proh dolor! nil preces, nil lacrymæ, nil demum valuere catenæ. Primis enim duabus noctibus, cum chori psallentium corpori assistabant, advenientes Dæmones <b>ostium</b> ecclesiæ confregerunt ingenti obice clausum, extremasque cathenas negotio levi dirumpunt: media autem quæ fortior erat, illibata manebat. Tertia autem nocte, circa gallicinium, strepitu hostium adventantium, omne monasterium visum est a fundamento moveri. Unus ergo dæmonum, et vultu cæteris terribilior & statura eminentior, januas Ecclesiæ; impetu violento concussas in fragmenta dejecit. Divexerunt clerici cum laicis, metu stelerunt omnium capilli, et psalmorum concentus defecit. Dæmon ergo gestu ut videbatur arroganti ad sepulchrum accedens, & nomen mulieris modicum ingeminans, surgere imperavit. Qua respondente, quod nequiret pro vinculis, jam malo tuo, inquit, solveris; et protinus cathenam quæ cæterorum ferociam dæmonum deluserat, velut stuppeum vinculum rumpebat. Operculum etiam sepulchri pede depellens, mulierem palam omnibus ab ecclesia extraxit, ubi præ foribus niger equus superbe hinniens videbatur, uncis ferreis et clavis undique confixus, super quem misera mulier projecta, ab oculis assistentium evanuit. Audiebantur tamen clamores per quatuor fere {{miliaria}} horribiles, auxilium postulantes.|$|E
5000|$|As the septum primum grows, the <b>ostium</b> primum {{progressively}} narrows. Before the <b>ostium</b> primum {{is completely}} occluded, a second opening called the <b>ostium</b> secundum begins {{to form in}} the septum primum. The <b>ostium</b> secundum allows continued shunting of blood from the right atrium to the left.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ostium</b> secundum {{provides}} {{communication between}} the atria after the <b>ostium</b> primum closes completely. Subsequently, a second wall of tissue, the septum secundum, grows over the <b>ostium</b> secundum in the right atrium. Bloodflow then only passes from the right to left atrium {{by way of a}} small passageway in the septum secundum and then through the <b>ostium</b> secundum. This passageway is called the foramen ovale.|$|E

50|$|The foramen ovale {{forms in}} the late fourth week of gestation. Initially the atria are {{separated}} from one another by the septum primum except for a small opening in the septum, the <b>ostium</b> primum. As the septum primum grows, the <b>ostium</b> primum narrows and eventually closes. Before it does so, bloodflow from the inferior vena cava wears down {{a portion of the}} septum primum, forming the <b>ostium</b> secundum. Some embryologists postulate that the <b>ostium</b> secundum may be formed through programmed cell death.|$|E
50|$|Below the bulla ethmoidalis, {{and partly}} {{hidden by the}} {{inferior}} end of the uncinate process of ethmoid bone, is the maxillary hiatus (or <b>ostium</b> maxillare, or maxillary sinus <b>ostium,</b> or maxillary <b>ostium,</b> or opening from the maxillary sinus); in a frontal section this opening is seen to be placed near {{the roof of the}} sinus.|$|E
5000|$|Blocked ostium: If the <b>ostium</b> of the sinus is blocked, {{the fluid}} doesn't return through it. To bypass the <b>ostium,</b> one more trocar and cannula are {{inserted}} {{at the site}} of the first one, a fluid returns through the other cannula.|$|E
