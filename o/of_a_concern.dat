5|$|Suicidal {{behavior}} is less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> when bupropion is prescribed for smoking cessation. According to a 2014 Cochrane review, {{while there is}} an association with suicide it is unclear if bupropion was the cause. In 2016 the FDA removed the black box warning about psychiatric problems when used for stopping smoking.|$|E
5|$|From then on, {{relations}} {{became increasingly}} strained between Matilda and Henry. The couple suspected that they lacked genuine support in England for {{their claim to}} the throne, and proposed in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda and should insist that the Norman nobility immediately swear allegiance to her. This {{would have given the}} couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death, but the King angrily refused, probably out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy while he was still alive. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels.|$|E
5|$|Nonpolar {{antioxidants}} such as eugenol—a {{major component}} of oil of cloves—have toxicity limits that can be exceeded with the misuse of undiluted essential oils. Toxicity associated with high doses of water-soluble antioxidants such as ascorbic acid are less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern,</b> as these compounds can be excreted rapidly in urine. More seriously, very high doses of some antioxidants may have harmful long-term effects. The beta-carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) study of lung cancer patients found that smokers given supplements containing beta-carotene and vitamin A had increased rates of lung cancer. Subsequent studies confirmed these adverse effects.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{attempted}} {{to build up}} a base of political support for Matilda in both England and Normandy, demanding that his court take oaths first in 1127, and then again in 1128 and 1131, to recognise Matilda as his immediate successor and recognise her descendants as the rightful rulers after her. Stephen was amongst those who took this oath in 1127. Nonetheless, relations between Henry, Matilda, and Geoffrey became increasingly strained {{towards the end of the}} King's life. Matilda and Geoffrey suspected that they lacked genuine support in England, and proposed to Henry in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda whilst he was still alive and insist on the Norman nobility swearing immediate allegiance to her, thereby giving the couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death. Henry angrily declined to do so, probably out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy somewhat earlier than intended. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels. In the middle of this confrontation, Henry unexpectedly fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Forêt.|$|E
5|$|More <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> to Dracula's planners, however, {{were the}} {{land-based}} {{threats to the}} landing craft carrying the assault troops of 26th Indian Division. Air support was deemed to be vital to the operation's success, {{and a number of}} Japanese airfields around Toungoo were captured {{in the days leading up}} to Dracula. There was also the problem of the defences in and around the River Rangoon, up which the landing craft were to sail. The river itself was heavily mined, a result of Japanese defensive measures as well as RAF offensive operations earlier in the conflict, and it would have to be swept and cleared of mines before any amphibious assault could take place. Before this could occur, however, the coastal defences along the banks of the river would have to be neutralized; a particular worry was the presence of an artillery battery at Elephant Point on the west bank of the river. The geography of the area ensured that the battery could not be destroyed through artillery bombardment or airstrikes, and weather conditions precluded an early amphibious assault. As such, it was decided that a day before Dracula began on 2 May, a parachute battalion would be dropped near Elephant Point with the task of assaulting and destroying the battery.|$|E

25|$|Because they do {{not require}} uranium enrichment, heavy water {{reactors}} are more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> in regards to nuclear proliferation.

This effect would be less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> in adults who have stopped growing.|$|E

Modeled on the offshore oil drilling platforms first employed off the Texas coast, they were in operation from 1958-1963.

25|$|As a {{tactical}} weapon for military use, {{a significant problem}} with a BW attack {{is that it would}} take days to be effective, and therefore might not immediately stop an opposing force. Some biological agents (smallpox, pneumonic plague) have the capability of person-to-person transmission via aerosolized respiratory droplets. This feature can be undesirable, as the agent(s) may be transmitted by this mechanism to unintended populations, including neutral or even friendly forces. While containment of BW is less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> for certain criminal or terrorist organizations, it remains a significant concern for the military and civilian populations of virtually all nations.|$|E
25|$|The major {{complaints}} against the area {{within the community}} were primarily against the dance halls and brothels, which reformers saw as the most immoral, {{as well as the}} general violence. The saloons and gambling halls were generally less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern.</b> In 1889, following serious bouts of violence in the city, officials shut down many of the activities that were deemed as most directly contributing to the violence. By the start of the 20th century, the Acre's popularity as a destination for out-of-town visitors had diminished dramatically. The Progressive movement of the early 20th century put increasing pressure on the area until it was shut down in 1917.|$|E
25|$|The British Boy Scouts {{was founded}} in 1908 as the Battersea Boy Scouts, a local {{association}} of Scout troops. The Battersea Boy Scouts later briefly registered with Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts organisation but, in 1909, withdrew and formed the British Boy Scouts (BBS), out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> that Baden-Powell's organisation was too bureaucratic and militaristic and too closely associated with commercial interests. Initially, the BBS was led by Major W.G. Whitby as Chief Commissioner and as financier. Assisting were Colonel Frederick Charles Keyser, President BBS and H. Moore secretary of the Battersea Boy Scouts. The BBS was launched as a national organisation on Empire Day, 24 May 1909.|$|E
