50|$|At present {{aviation}} {{accounts for}} 2.5% of global CO2 emissions. Due to projected growth in air travel, {{in the most}} technologically radical scenarios for having a better than 50% chance of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, in 2050 aviation will make up 15% of global CO2 emissions. In more conventional scenarios its emissions will exceed the entire global carbon budget before then. This presents governments and the <b>operators</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> with a responsibility to reduce the aviation industry's emissions.|$|E

50|$|Manufacturers and <b>operators</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> have a {{financial}} interest {{in ensuring that}} the inspection schedule is as cost-efficient as possible. Because aircraft are often revenue producing, {{there is an opportunity}} cost associated with the maintenance of the aircraft (lost ticket revenue), in addition to the cost of maintenance itself. Thus, this maintenance is desired to be performed infrequently, even when such increased intervals cause increased complexity and cost to the overhaul. Crack growth, as shown by fracture mechanics, is exponential in nature; meaning that the crack growth rate is a function of an exponent of the current crack size (see Paris' law). A desire for infrequent inspection intervals, combined with the exponential growth of cracks in structure has {{led to the development of}} non-destructive testing methods which allow inspectors to look for very tiny cracks which are often invisible to the naked eye. Examples of this technology include eddy current, ultrasonic, dye penetrant, and X-ray inspections. By catching structural cracks when they are very small, and growing slowly, these non-destructive inspections can reduce the amount of maintenance checks, and allow damage to be caught when it is small, and still inexpensive to repair.|$|E

40|$|Researchers at Georgia Tech have {{developed}} a hierarchical model of two main types of aviation safety inspections typically conducted by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aviation Safety Inspectors (ASIs). This model, developed through function and task analyses and focus group discussions, will {{improve the quality of}} safety inspection data. The model will provide additional structure in the documentation of inspection results; in addition to collecting more specific data concerning an inspection, the use of a hierarchy will allow reconstruction of the inspection scenario during subsequent analyses. These enhancements to collected data will support trend analyses of specific problem areas that may impact aviation safety.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} the old-fashioned communication and radio navigation techniques {{as a starting point for}} the development of new technologies for the Air Traffic Control based on 1940 ’s era radar. Current research tendencies focus on the reduction of delays and overload in a congested airspace. A key step in providing increased situational awareness for controllers and pilots is sharing operational information to improve access and flexibility. Communication between cockpit and controller through audio channels has become insufficient with the growing number of flights that take to skies every day and every year; therefore the need for alternative solutions to meet that demand has appeared. New technologies use messaging to deliver clearances, coordinates and commands determining the <b>operators</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> to see the information, acknowledge, and act. Besides the new means of communication, precision navigation guidance based on GPS signals has been developed for exact alignment and descent of aircraft on approach to land on a runway...|$|E
40|$|Residents {{living in}} close, middle and distant areas from JFK Airport were {{included}} in a field interview and laboratory study. Judgments were made of simulated aircraft noise exposures of comparable community indoor noise levels and mixes of aircraft. Each group of subjects judged the levels of noise typical for its distance area. Four different numbers of flyovers were tested: less than average for each area, the approximate average, the peak number, or worst day, and above peak number. The major findings are: (1) the reported integrated field annoyance is best related to the annoyance reported for the simulated approximate worst day exposure in the laboratory; (2) annoyance is generally less when there are fewer aircraft flyovers, and the subject has less fear of crashes and more favorable attitudes toward airplanes; (3) beliefs in harmful health effects and misfeasance by <b>operators</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> are also highly correlated with fear and noise annoyance; (4) in direct retrospective comparisons of number of flights, noise levels and annoyance, subjects more often said the worst day laboratory exposured more like their usual home environments; and (5) subjects do not expect an annoyance-free environment. Half of the subjects can accept an annoyance level of 5 to 6 from a possible annoyance range of 0 to 9, 28 % can live with an annoyance intensity of 7, and only 5 % can accept the top scores of 8 to 9...|$|E

40|$|In the Paris Agreement 2015 (COP 21, CMP 11), the world's {{leaders have}} {{confirmed}} {{that there is a}} need for fundamental changes of existing patterns of production and consumption to mitigate global warming, which affects the livelihood of an increasing amount of people worldwide. Changes of these patterns involve significant economic costs, but polluters can refuse to pay their pollution costs adequately due to the absence of market prices for environmental public goods. In order to create financial incentives for pollution reduction, policy makers are paying closer attention to instruments of environmental economics. Within this study, the lack of incentivizing airlines to internalize their climate costs is tried to be closed by the introduction of climate-charged airspaces, as non-CO 2 emissions have location- and time-dependent effects upon the climate. In order to create an incentive for airlines to minimize flight time and emissions in highly climate-sensitive regions, a climate charge should be imposed for <b>operators</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> when flying through them. Cost-minimizing airlines are expected to re-route their flights to reduce their climate charges and hence cash operating costs. Accordingly, this leads to the desired outcome of incentivizing reduction of global warming and even driving technological innovation towards cleaner technologies. The evaluation of the climate impact mitigation potential of climate-charged airspaces is performed based on optimal control techniques. Climate sensitivities are expressed by climate change functions characterizing the climate impact caused by an emission at a certain location and time. The cost-benefit potential (climate impact mitigation vs. rise in operating costs) is investigated for an US-route and benchmarked against climate-optimized trajectories...|$|E
