5|$|Coker {{grew up in}} Linden, New Jersey {{and became}} an Eagle Scout in Troop 32 of Saint Elizabeth's Catholic Church in Linden on January 27, 1959. He has stated that his passion for Scouting is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> got him through his 6.5years as a POW in North Vietnam, {{to the point that}} at times all he could {{remember}} was the Scout Oath, but not the names of his family members.|$|E
5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Spector {{wanted to}} achieve in Deus Ex was to make JC Denton a cipher for the player, {{in order to create}} a better {{immersion}} and gameplay experience. He did not want the character to force any emotion so that whatever feelings the player may be experiencing comes from themselves rather than from JC Denton. To do this, Spector instructed voice actor Jay Anthony Franke to record his dialogue without any emotion but in a monotone voice, which is unusual for a voice acting role.|$|E

5|$|Carlsen {{was born}} in Tønsberg, Norway, on 30 November 1990, to Sigrun Øen, a {{chemical}} engineer and Henrik Albert Carlsen, an IT consultant. The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum. Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age: at two years, he could solve 50-piece jigsaw puzzles; at four, he enjoyed assembling Lego sets with instructions intended for children aged 10–14. His father taught him to play chess {{at the age of}} 5, although he initially showed little interest in the game. He has three sisters, and in 2010 he stated that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> first motivated him to take up chess seriously was the desire to beat his elder sister at the game.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in October 2003. The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first Knights of the Old Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write Knights of the Old Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried {{to learn as much}} about the Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> made Knights of the Old Republic great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.|$|E
5|$|The {{justification}} for the closure of Loring was that the Air Force had six more strategic bases than were needed to support the number of bomber and tanker aircraft in the Defense Department's Structure Plan. The base was evaluated against eight selection criteria {{and a large number}} of subelements specific to Air Force bases and missions. Even though Loring was in good condition and had strong community support, it ranked low in the criteria when compared to twenty other bases in the strategic category. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> hurt Loring was its limited peacetime value as a tanker base, as well as its distance from bombing ranges. The commission did note that the facilities at Loring were above average, and the cost to close Loring would be low, the latter of which contributed to its closure.|$|E

25|$|The Tale was {{originally}} published in 1704 by John Nutt. Swift had used Benjamin Tooke previously when publishing for Sir William Temple. He would use Tooke for both the fifth edition of the Tale (1710) and later works. Tooke's successor, Benjamin Motte, published Swift's Gulliver's Travels. This difference in printer is only one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> led to debate over authorship of the work.|$|E

25|$|The Hebrew word mashiach (or moshiach), anglicized to messiah, means anointed, {{a meaning}} {{preserved}} in the English word derived from it, messiah.

While the name of Jewish Messiah is considered to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> precede creation, he is not considered divine, in contrast to Christianity where Jesus is both divine and the Messiah.|$|E
25|$|Reason and {{imagination}} rely on similar mental processes. Imagination {{is not only}} found in humans. Aristotle, for example, stated that phantasia (imagination: that which can hold images or phantasmata) and phronein (a type of thinking that can judge and understand in some sense) also exist in some animals. According to him, both {{are related to the}} primary perceptive ability of animals, which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are perceived without distinguishing universals, and without deliberation or logos. But this is not yet reason, because human imagination is different.|$|E
