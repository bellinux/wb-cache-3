[...] A 2006 feasibility study suggested it optimal to build an 11.5 GWe capacity nuclear power plant. However, this proving unaffordable in the immediate future, Poland decided to build a 4.5 GWe nuclear power plant by 2030. In 2007, a draft energy policy proposed a 10 GWe nuclear capacity by 2030 to provide 10% of electricity.

50|$|Further {{development}} {{introduced in}} 2016. Upgrades include improved armor, armament, and mobility. The hull armor and cast turret have been upgraded with add-on composite armor equivalent {{to up to}} 1000mm RHA (rolled homogenous armor), supplied by Germany. The protection can also be improved with Polish ERAWA explosive reactive armor. The 125mm smoothbore cannon has been replaced with a 120mm smoothbore cannon compatible with NATO ammunition, and uses a carousel type autoloader. This autoloader is separate from the crew compartment, where the T-72 autoloader was located. The manned 12.7mm machine gun has been upgraded to be remotely operated. Other improvements include an upgraded fire control system. The tank is proposed to be fitted with a new engine, options for which include an unspecified Serbian turbocharged diesel, a German 1088 hp, Serbian V46-TK, and potential, to be developed, 1200 hp engines. Other improvements include rubber skirts covering the lower hull and the tracks, and new tracks based on those found on German Leopard 2s, which can be fitted with deep wading kits {{to allow it to}} ford water obstacles up to 13 feet (4 meters) deep. The upgrade can be applied to both PT-91s and T-72M1s, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>Poland</b> has a total of 823 (233 PT-91s, 120 active T-72M1s, and 470 reserve T-72M1s).|$|E
5000|$|In 1003, Bolesław I {{conquered the}} Duchy of Bohemia, imprisoned its Přemyslid duke, Boleslaus III, and denied Henry II {{the oath of}} {{allegiance}} for the duchy. Henry II did not accept this, and was determined to contest the Polish claims to the Bohemian duchy. Bolesław I had further allied with the noble German opposition to Henry II. This alliance included Henry of Schweinfurt, his cousin Ernst as well as Henry II's brother Brun (Bruno), bishop of Augsburg, all of which fled to Bolesław's court when their rebellion against Henry II failed. While Bolesław I could draw upon the support of many secular Saxon nobles, Henry II could rely on the Saxon clergy. Also in 1003, Henry II allied with the pagan Lutici against Bolesław I, and in 1004 launched a campaign against the latter. In {{the course of this}} campaign, Henry II evicted Bolesław I from Bohemia and granted it to the Přemyslid duke Jaromir in 1004, before he besieged and took Bautzen from Bolesław I's forces and incorporated it into the Duchy of Saxony. A few months later, together with Veleti and Czech allies, Henry II mounted another campaign. He crossed the Oder near Krosno and advanced into Greater Poland. Bolesław however avoided an open battle, harried the emperor's troops with guerrilla tactics and caused [...] "great losses", according to contemporary German chroniclers. The fighting was concluded in 1005 when Tagino, Archbishop of Magdeburg mediated a peace near Poznań, as a result <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>Poland</b> had to give up Lusatia and Meissen but kept Slovakia and Moravia for the time being.|$|E
40|$|The Silesians are {{an ethnic}} or {{national}} group that coalesced {{in the nineteenth}} century. During the subsequent century, they survived repeated divisions of their historical region of Upper Silesia among the nation-states of Czechoslovakia (or today its western half, that is, the Czech Republic), Germany, and Poland, which entailed Czechization, Germanization, and Polonization, respectively. The ideal of ethnolinguistic homogeneity, a typical goal of Central European nationalism, was achieved in post-war Poland. After the end of communism (1989) and the country‟s accession to the European Union (2004), this ideal is still aspired to, though it appears to stand in direct conflict with the values of democracy and rule of law. The Silesians are the largest minority in today‟s Poland and Silesian speakers are the second largest speech community in this country after Polish-speakers. Despite the Silesians ‟ wish {{to be recognized as}} a minority, expressed clearly in their grassroots initiatives and in the Polish censuses of 2002 and 2011, Poland neither recognizes them nor their language. This inflexible attitude may amount to a breach of the spirit (if not the letter) of the Council of Europe‟s Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, both <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>Poland</b> signed and ratified. The case of the Silesians is a litmus test of the quality of Polish democracy. In order to resolve the debacle, the article proposes a genuine dialogue between representatives of Silesian organizations and the Polish administration under the guidance of observers and facilitators from the Council of Europe and appropriate international non-governmental organizations...|$|E

40|$|In {{seven years}} from the {{eruption}} of a global economic crisis, a noticeable change {{has taken place in}} the approach of economists, as well as international economic organisations (i. e. IMF and the World Bank), to analysing the occurring crisis phenomena. A purpose of the article is to present transformation of views and positions of the abovementioned communities in the context of experiences in overcoming crisis and of the modern challenges of post-crisis economy. In this scope, the article shows changes in economic theory and policy and proposals for the new state role, especially emphasizing the significance of institutional environment for socio-economic development. The assumed research task, performed {{on the basis of a}} critical analysis of subject’s literature, serves to verify an initial hypothesis of gradual formation of new rules of the game, i. e. institutional order, in the post-crisis world, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>Poland</b> is a part. The postulated institutional order would constitute a connection of social, economic and political aspects. The analysis conducted in the article proved an influence of occurring crisis phenomena on evolution of economic science and policy. In this area, in order to increase explanatory and predictive power of macroeconomics, it is recommended to make use of a more heterodox approach which includes taking into account the financial markets’ behavior and macroeconomic effects of income inequalities. In general, it can be stated that current revaluations in thinking about economy, although being the prerequisites for institutional change, are not of a breakthrough character, so they do not constitute critical junctures in economic development and theory. In this regard, the significance of governments’ political will is emphasized as a basic factor in resolving problems resulting from global economic crisis. crisis phenomena; lessons from economic crisis for economics and economic policy; socio-economic development; new role of the state; significance of institutional environmen...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{undertake}} {{the problem of}} efficiency of reforming the economy in a situation <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>Poland</b> {{in the end of}} the 70 may be a typami example. In the first place the subject of the analysis is a so-called "typical reaction" of an enterprise in the centrally controlled economy. This analysas, carried out by means of microeconomic theories of balance of an enterprise, leads {{to the conclusion that the}} purpose of an enterprise functioning in a traditional socialist economy is to maximize the difference between the outlay received to carry out a given production task and the outlay which is actually necessary. The next argument of the article is that a long-lasting persistence of such a typical reaction leads in the whole economy not to a common imbalance of a demand type but to the asymetrie imbalance. The latter phenomenon manifests itself through the fact that the closer is to the beginning of a technological cycle, the higher the imbalance proves to be. In turn, asymetry brings to life a specific economic structure with the production potential growing higher the closer it is to the beginning of a technological cycle. Changing the topic of their considerations, the authors then introduce the differentiation between the three systems of managing the socialist economy, i. e. the discretionary, formal-individualized and market systems. In Poland, attempts are made to introduce the second system, consisting in a strict and regulated dependence between the level of production and the level of reward. Coming back to the former line of considerations, the authors introduce the notion of structural imbalance. It is the result of the asymetry of imbalance persisting for a long time and the subsequent emergence of the economic structure of a respective kind. If the structural imbalance extends over the good which in the formal-individualized system is to become a "reward", then the reform consisting in introducing such a system may only evoke inflation and is bound to fail. The authors state that in Poland there are no other goods but those encompassed by the structural imbalance. The article ends with the characterization of the course of retreat from the reform. According to the authors, such a retreat is inevitable if the reform is that of formal-individualized and not market type.
