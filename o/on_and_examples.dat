40|$|In this article, teacher-student {{relationships}} are approached from a motivational perspective. Theoretical underpinnings come from Self-determination theory. Basic assumptions and central concepts of this theory are discussed. The {{meaning of this}} theory to the educational context, here teacher-student relationships, is focused <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>examples</b> of empirical evidence are given. Four studies conducted in the Netherlands (in primary and secondary education), which reveal relevance for the main concepts of Self-determination theory, are discussed. Attention is paid to basic need satisfaction in teacher-student relationships, the development of teacher-student relationships across the school year and connections between characteristics of teacher-student relationships and affective student outcomes (motivation, academic engagement). Multilevel (growth curve) analyses were used to explore developments of and connections between teacher-student relationships and affective student outcomes. Finally, the relevance of Selfdetermination theory for the optimization of teacher-student relationships in relation to students' motivation and academic engagement is discussed...|$|E

The design of the software is intended to support and enhance the development of research questioning, information and literature search and the general process of research paper writing for student in university and college settings. In this paper the program is presented, howit functions through an interactive process of posing questions and tasks for the student by supplying information <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>examples</b> of formulation of the basic choices steering a student research design. The underlying concept of the genre ‘the research paper ’ is presented and exemplified {{by one of the}} software’s examples. Notions of genre and of teaching genre as well as views on teaching informaiton literacy are discussed and seen in the light of writing development and student motivation.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{proliferation of}} spatial data, geographic information systems (GIS), and models for hydrologic applications provide many new investigation opportunities but also present {{a number of}} challenges for the uninitiated water resources practitioner. This two-part paper is intended for the practicing engineer who wants to expand into the arena of spatial data and distributed watershed modeling. It provides an integrated overview of the multiple facets of data-GIS-modeling issues {{and a source of}} background information for selection and application of GIS in watershed modeling. This first paper addresses selected spatial data issues, data structures and projections, data sources, and information on data resolution and uncertainties. Spatial data that are covered include digital elevation data, stream and drainage data, soil data, digital orthophoto data, remotely sensed data, and radar precipitation data. The focus is on data and issues that are common to many data-GIS-modeling applications. The second paper presents issues <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>examples</b> of GIS and hydrologic models and provides recommendations with respect to organization and implementation of the integrated use of spatial data, GIS, and distributed watershed models...|$|E
40|$|From {{the systems}} point of view, the {{objectives}} of higher education cannot be defined apart from {{the economic and social}} context in which the university operates. The report presents the results of a 4 -year research project during which a mathematical model was developed to describe {{the way in which the}} university, as part of a socioeconomic system, utilizes its resources in production. The model, designed to aid university administrators in the overall allocation of resources, consists of sets of equations that describe the relationship of resources to production and, based on these, the associated unit costs of production. Resources (input) are described as personnel, space, and equipment, and products (output) as developed manpower, research, and public or technical services. The model does not tell the decision maker how to create a more effective educational institution, but provides him with a tool for evaluating the changes in the types of resources [...] or the potential economic gain [...] which could result from proposed changes in the design of the institution. The report contains a brief non-technical review and a detailed technical description of the model, and discussion <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>examples</b> of how to use it i...|$|E
40|$|History {{shows that}} {{humankind}} {{has always had}} an appetite for psychoactive substances. Since young people are especially vulnerable to drug abuse, the etiology, epidemiology, and prevention literature on substance use by school-aged children are exami. led in this booklet. It aives information <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>examples</b> of, preventive approaches and programs in schools and communities {{in addition to providing}} guidelines for preventive work. Because of the diversity of substance use and prevention goals around the world, the information and guidelines presented here are stated in general terms. The book opens with an overview of drinking, providing examples of drinking behavior, drinking styles, and risks associated with alcohol use. Drug use among young people is discussed next, including reasons why young people use drugs. Tobacco use by children is then examined, along with determinants of tobacco use and the harm tobacco can cause. Prevention is the focus of the text and examples of health promotion within schools are provided. Tips on working with community members, working with other agencies, and working with parents are offered. Emphasis is also placed on education in the schools, on policies for developing prevention in schools, and on youth organizations, such as community sports clubs and prevention clubs.

40|$|MOOCs offer {{opportunities}} but {{are also}} pose the danger of further exacerbating existing educational divisions and deepening the homogeneity of global knowledge systems. Like many universities globally, South African university leaders and those responsible for course, curriculum, and learning technology development are {{coming to grips with}} the implications and possibilities of online and open education for their own institutions. What opportunities do they offer to universities, especially {{from the point of view}} of research-focused campus-based institutions which have not yet engaged with MOOCs and have little history with online courses? Given the complexities of the MOOC-scape, this paper provides a means for contextualising the options within an institutional landscape of educational provision as possibilities for MOOC creation, use and adaptation. This takes into account what is currently available and identifies what new opportunities can be explored. Refining this further, a categorisation of existing MOOCs is provided that maps to broad institutional interests. The notion of courses offered by universities as being either primarily ‘inward’ or ‘outward’ facing is explained. Five categories of MOOCs are described: Category One, Teaching Showcase; Category Two, Gateway Skills; Category Three, Graduate Skills; Category Four, Professional Skills and Category Five, Research Showcase. These are elaborated <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>examples</b> provided. This taxonomy provides a nuanced way of understanding MOOCs and MOOC type courses in order for educators to strategically prioritise and decision makers to support the full gamut of emergent opportunities...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact that}} mobile web-enabled devices have had <b>on</b> the lives <b>and</b> {{behavior}} of university students has been immense.

40|$|Spectral {{portraits and}} pseudospectra have {{recently}} {{attracted the attention}} of many scientists as a tool of choice for investigating spectral properties of nonnormal matrices. Until now, most of the papers devoted to this topic were generally dealing with the standard eigenproblem Ax = x. However in practice, physical applications often give rise to generalized eigenproblems Ax = Bx. It is therefore natural to extend the notion of "-pseudospectrum and spectral portrait to matrix pencils (A; B). In this paper, we explain how to define and compute spectral portraits for matrix pencils and we illustrate their importance <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>example</b> in Computational Fluid Dynamics.
