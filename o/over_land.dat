5|$|The {{associated}} thunderstorm activity became {{separated from}} the center of circulation, and early on June 1, the center became difficult to locate due to becoming disorganized.

By June4, the remnants of Arthur were diminishing over southeastern Mexico without any redevelopment. Thunderstorms briefly redeveloped two days later, as its associated circulation crossed over the Bay of Campeche into Veracruz, although it dissipated soon after.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Leon–Eline in February 2000 was the third-longest tracked {{tropical}} cyclone in the South-West Indian Ocean. On February1, a tropical low originated within the monsoon trough {{to the south}} of Indonesia, and would eventually become Tropical Cyclone Leon in the Australian basin. Moving westward, the storm fluctuated in strength due to changes in the atmosphere, mostly increasing and decreasing wind shear. After crossing 90°E, the Météo-France office in Réunion (MFR) began tracking the system as Tropical Storm Eline on February8. The storm continued across the Indian Ocean and intensified greatly as it approached the east coast of Madagascar. Late on February17, Eline made landfall near Mahanoro, with 10‑minute winds of 165km/h (105mph). The storm rapidly weakened <b>over</b> <b>land,</b> but restrengthened in the Mozambique Channel to reach peak 10‑minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). On February22, Eline made landfall about 80km (50mi) south of Beira, Mozambique near peak intensity and quickly weakened <b>over</b> <b>land.</b> The well-defined circulation moved across southern Africa, finally dissipating over eastern Namibia on February29.|$|E

5|$|Despite initial forecasts, the cyclone {{failed to}} {{strengthen}} further due to interaction with Madagascar. Early on February14, Bingiza made landfall along the Masoala Peninsula with winds {{of at least}} 150km/h (90mph). It emerged into the Antongil Bay, before moving ashore north of Manambolosy. It quickly weakened <b>over</b> <b>land,</b> although it produced heavy rainfall along its northern periphery. Early on February15, Bingiza weakened to a tropical depression. The center became difficult to locate <b>over</b> <b>land,</b> although it emerged into the Mozambique Channel north of Besalampy as a tropical disturbance. After moving over waters, the system was able to re-intensify due to favorable water temperatures and inflow. It quickly organized into a tropical depression again, although strengthening was halted after it turned southward over western Madagascar due to a ridge to its north. It again moved into the Mozambique Channel, and Bingiza re-intensified into a tropical storm on February17. The storm developed a concentrated area of convection near the center, {{as well as a}} poorly defined eye. The re-intensification was short-lived after Bingiza made its final landfall just south of Morondava around 1330UTC on February17. Around that time, the circulation was dissipating <b>over</b> <b>land,</b> and its remnants left the island on February19.|$|E
5|$|Domoina {{developed}} on January16 off the northeast coast of Madagascar. With a ridge to the north, the storm tracked generally westward and later southwestward. On January21, Domoina struck eastern Madagascar. After crossing the country, Domoina strengthened in the Mozambique channel to peak winds of 95km/h (60mph). On January28, the storm made landfall in southern Mozambique, and slowly weakened <b>over</b> <b>land.</b> Domoina crossed into Swaziland and later eastern South Africa before dissipating on February2.|$|E
5|$|Due to land {{interaction}} and its eyewall replacement cycle, Hurricane John weakened to a 105mph (170km/h) hurricane by late on August 31, but restrengthened {{to a major}} hurricane shortly after as its eye became better defined. After completing another eyewall replacement cycle, the hurricane again weakened to Category2 status, and on September 1, it made landfall on Cabo del Este on {{the southern tip of}} Baja California Sur with winds of 110mph (180km/h). John passed near La Paz as a weakening Category1 hurricane on September 2, and weakened to a tropical storm shortly thereafter <b>over</b> <b>land.</b> John continued to weaken, and late on September 3, the system deteriorated to a tropical depression while still <b>over</b> <b>land.</b> By September 4, most of the convection decoupled from the circulation towards mainland Mexico, and a clear circulation had not been discernible for 24hours. Based on the disorganization of the system, the National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the system.|$|E

5|$|Early on October26, a {{tropical}} depression {{formed in the}} central Gulf of Mexico, and intensified into Hurricane Juan while meandering northward. The storm had a large wind field and was somewhat subtropical in nature. Due to weak steering currents, Juan looped once offshore Louisiana and later looped again over the state, weakening into {{a tropical}} storm <b>over</b> <b>land</b> on October29. The storm turned eastward and later northeastward, striking just west of Pensacola, Florida late on October31. Juan turned to the north <b>over</b> <b>land</b> and became extratropical on November1 over Tennessee. After the remnants of Juan continued to the north into Canada, it spawned an occluded low in the Tennessee Valley. This low continued to the east through North Carolina, bringing moderate rainfall throughout the region, and saturating soils; overcast skies and the weak sunlight of early November prevented much of the rains from evaporating.|$|E
5|$|Early on September19, Typhoon Fanapi made {{landfall}} over eastern Taiwan near Hualien City with {{winds of}} , according to Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau. The storm subsequently weakened <b>over</b> <b>land,</b> dipping southwestward as convection diminished over the northern {{portion of the}} storm. However, the storm resumed its westward trajectory and soon moved over the Taiwan Strait as a severe tropical storm. The thunderstorms reorganized slightly as Fanapi reached open waters, and a nearby ship reported winds of 120km/h (75mph). Early on September20, the storm made a second landfall on southeastern China near Fujian and weakened further <b>over</b> <b>land,</b> although thunderstorms persisted southeast of the circulation along the coast. Fanapi weakened into a tropical depression later that day and dissipated late on September21.|$|E
5|$|Eline {{was unusual}} in its track after {{striking}} Madagascar.
