5|$|The {{peaceful}} lull {{following the}} Cisplatine conflict {{did not last}} long. On 20 September 1835, a civil war erupted in Rio Grande do Sul. The revolt, known as the Ragamuffin War, began after the provincial president (governor) was removed from office in a coup d'état. Despite the nickname, the Ragamuffin rebels were landlords, like Marques de Sousa, who after losing elections tried to take power by force. Marques de Sousa was among the army officers in the province who remained loyal to the deposed president. He fought in the Battle of Arroio Grande on 14 October 1835, in which rebel troops were defeated. But the forces loyal to the legitimate government were heavily outnumbered. Marques de Sousa and the deposed president departed for Rio de Janeiro to request aid, but the central government was unable to render much assistance, as rebellions and riots had broken <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> country. With the infantry's 1st Battalion of Caçadores (Sharpshooters) placed under his command, Marques de Sousa embarked on 8 March 1836 for Pelotas, in southeastern Rio Grande do Sul, after being named its military commander.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategy}} {{of keeping the}} air force and navy out from the conflict proved to be ineffective, as the violence spread <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> country, and the army came under great pressure from the militants in 2004–07. In 2007, General Ehsan-ul-Haq admitted publicly that keeping the navy and the air force out of the conflict was a mistake.|$|E
25|$|Indian attacks {{increased}} significantly after 1860, {{when most of}} the army troops were withdrawn, and miners and ranchers began fanning <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> country, often encroaching on Indian territory. Increased attacks along the Humboldt led to most travelers' taking the Central Nevada Route. The Goodall cutoff, developed in Idaho in 1862, kept Oregon bound travelers away from much of the Indian trouble nearer the Snake River. Other trails were developed that traveled further along the South Platte to avoid local Indian hot spots.|$|E

25|$|The {{occupation}} of Western Russia ultimately proved a costly blunder for Berlin as {{over one million}} German troops lay sprawled out from Poland nearly to the Caspian Sea, all idle and depriving Germany of badly needed manpower in France. The hopes of utilizing Ukraine's grain and coal proved abortive and in addition, the local population became increasingly upset at the occupying army. Revolts and guerrilla warfare began breaking <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> occupied zone, many of them inspired by Bolshevik agents. German troops had to intervene in Finland to put down an attempted Bolshevik coup, and Ludendorff became increasingly paranoid about his troops being affected by propaganda emanating from Moscow; {{this was one of}} the reasons he was reluctant to transfer divisions to the Western Front. The attempt at establishing an independent Ukrainian state under German guidance was unsuccessful as well. Despite all this, Ludendorff completely ruled out the idea of marching on Moscow and Petrograd to remove the Bolshevik government from power.|$|E
25|$|Measurements of {{the energy}} and arrival {{directions}} of the ultra-high energy primary cosmic rays by the techniques of density sampling and fast timing of extensive air showers were first carried out in 1954 {{by members of the}} Rossi Cosmic Ray Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The experiment employed eleven scintillation detectors arranged within a circle 460 meters in diameter {{on the grounds of the}} Agassiz Station of the Harvard College Observatory. From that work, and from many other experiments carried <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> world, the energy spectrum of the primary cosmic rays is now known to extend beyond 1020eV. A huge air shower experiment called the Auger Project is currently operated at a site on the pampas of Argentina by an international consortium of physicists, led by James Cronin, winner of the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics from the University of Chicago, and Alan Watson of the University of Leeds. Their aim is to explore the properties and arrival directions of the very highest-energy primary cosmic rays. The results are expected to have important implications for particle physics and cosmology, due to a theoretical Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit to the energies of cosmic rays from long distances (about 160 million light years) which occurs above 1020eV because of interactions with the remnant photons from the Big Bang origin of the universe.|$|E

Riley distracts Adam's demonoid minions while Buffy confronts Adam. However, Adam, after modulating his arm to dispense a minigun, is able to overpower her. Suddenly, the spell begins to work: to function as one unit, Willow becomes the spirit, Giles the mind, Xander the heart, and Buffy the hand, or strength of their ensemble. They work through Buffy to neutralize Adam, telling him [...] "You could never hope to grasp {{the source of our}} power". Adam, alone but intrigued, shoots at them to no avail. Adam then shoots a missile, which is changed into doves, and his gun is reverted into his arm. They are able, through Buffy, to punch inside Adam's chest, remove his uranium core, destroying him.|$|E

Street flooding in Lake Charles was severe, though only a few houses suffered flood damage. To the south of Lake Charles, minor damage was reported in Cameron Parish, totaling to about $500,000 (1982USD). However, due to high tides, damage along the coastal areas of that parish was considerable. A Cameron Parish official noted [...] "There's power <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> place, and we understand {{there was quite a}} bit of damage at Holly Beach". In Evangeline Parish, an F2 tornado on the Fujita Scale destroyed four buildings and damaged seven other structures. In northeastern Louisiana, wind damage was [...] "spotty" [...] and limited to downed trees and powerlines. As a result of heavy rainfall in that portion of the state, low-lying areas flooded, and bayous overflowed. A tornado, rated at F3, destroyed eleven houses and one church in Clayton. In addition, the tornado knocked down trees and powerlines in the area. Overall, damage in Louisiana was near $1million (1982USD).|$|E

[...] USA Today gave the film three out of four stars. However, Richard Corliss in Time said that Raimi was not [...] "effective with actors" [...] and Peoples Ralph Novak called Darkman, a [...] "loud, sadistic, stupidly written, wretchedly acted film." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "The movie is full of jaunty, Grand Guignol touches (the main gangster enjoys snapping and collecting fingers), but Raimi's images also have a spectral, kinetic beauty." [...] In his review for the Washington Post, Joe Brown wrote, [...] "Though Raimi seems to be trying to restrain himself, his giddily sick sense of humor still pops <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> place – Darkman is a frenetic funhouse ride that has you laughing and screaming at the same time." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a {{condition}} for ceding leadership to Yuan Shikai, Sun Yat-sen insisted that the provisional government remain in Nanjing. On February 14, the Provisional Senate initially voted 20–5 in favor of making Beijing the capital over Nanjing, with two votes going for Wuhan and one for Tianjin. The Senate majority wanted to secure the peace agreement by taking power in Beijing. Zhang Jian and others reasoned that having the capital in Beijing would check against Manchu restoration and Mongol secession. But Sun and Huang Xing argued in favor of Nanjing to balance against Yuan's power base in the north. Li Yuanhong presented Wuhan as a compromise. The next day, the Provisional Senate voted again, this time, 19-6 in favor of Nanjing with two votes for Wuhan. Sun sent a delegation led by Cai Yuanpei and Wang Jingwei to persuade Yuan to move to Nanjing. Yuan welcomed the delegation and agreed to accompany the delegates back to the south. Then {{on the evening of}} February 29, riots and fires broke <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> city. [...] They were allegedly started by disobedient troops of Cao Kun, a loyal officer of Yuan. The disorder gave Yuan the pretext to stay in the north to guard against unrest. On March 10, Yuan was inaugurated in Beijing as the provisional president of the Republic of China. On April 5, the Provisional Senate in Nanjing voted to make Beijing the capital of the Republic and convened in Beijing {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E
