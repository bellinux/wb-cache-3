5|$|The {{town was}} not {{represented}} in Parliament until given one {{member in the}} House of Commons by the Reform Act of 1832. Separate representation was abolished for the 1950 general election, with Frome itself being transferred to the Wells division, whilst most of {{the remainder of the}} constituency formed the bulk of the new Somerset North constituency. Further changes took place for the 1983 general election when the current Somerton and Frome constituency was created. The current representative is Conservative MP David Warburton. During the general election of 2015, in which 72% of those eligible turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> David Warburton achieved a majority of 20,268 votes (33.6% of the total), Frome is within the South West England European Parliamentary constituency which elects six MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.|$|E

25|$|Political {{scientist}} Ivan Choy Chi-keung {{believed that}} the unrest would attract conservative voters come <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for the pro-Beijing candidate Holden Chow Ho-ding of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong and further consolidate the radical localist base of Leung, which would place the pan-democracy Civic Party's Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu at a disadvantage.|$|E
25|$|The polling {{stations}} were open from 7:00 to 20:00. Voting took place using electronic voting machines (EVMs) {{for the first}} time. The voting machines were {{set up by the}} Canadian company Dominion Voting Systems to report results immediately to the General Election Committee rather than any kind of tabulation by the local election officials. Of the 1,833,000 eligible voters, 65% turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote.</b> There were 544 candidates, of which 174 were women.|$|E
50|$|Parkes and her activist friends {{interacted with}} women in other {{countries}} of Europe and in the United States, adding a very considerable international dimension to their efforts.

5000|$|Total {{number of}} 2,80,910 electors (1,49,626 male and 1,31,274 female) were registered. Out of those, only 1,69,281 (60.26%) voters turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> cast their <b>votes</b> in 275 polling stations.|$|R
25|$|Official {{results of}} the {{referendum}} showed that 59.24% of the Portuguese approved the proposal put on ballot, while 40.76% rejected it. However, only 43.61% of the registered voters turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote.</b> Since abstention was over 50%, according to the Portuguese Constitution, these results are not legally binding, and parliament can legally decide to disregard them. Prime Minister Sócrates nevertheless confirmed that he would expand {{the circumstances under which}} abortion was allowed, since a majority of voters had been in favour.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{official}} results, the highest turnout was in Chechnya at 99.5%, of which 99.36% votes were cast for United Russia; the Chechen pro-Moscow leader Ramzan Kadyrov had publicly promised beforehand to deliver 100 percent of his republic's vote for Putin. In the neighbouring Republic of Ingushetia, where {{the official}} results also said around 99 percent of the republic's population had voted and {{nearly all of them}} for the pro-Putin party, the elections were preceded by mass protests against the government, and observers suggested that in fact only 8% of people turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> there.|$|E
25|$|Except in closely fought swing states, {{voter turnout}} is largely {{insignificant}} due to entrenched political party domination in most states. The Electoral College decreases the advantage {{a political party}} or campaign might gain for encouraging voters to turn out, except in those swing states. If the presidential election were decided by a national popular vote, in contrast, campaigns and parties would have a strong incentive to work to increase turnout everywhere. Individuals would similarly have a stronger incentive to persuade their friends and neighbors to turn <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote.</b> The differences in turnout between swing states and non-swing states under the current electoral college system suggest that replacing the Electoral College with direct election by popular vote would likely increase turnout and participation significantly.|$|E

You m'say we can talk it over outside the order. Yes, but I tell you, Mr. President, the order's the place for it.

While just 12 percent of individuals living in Ward 5 were poor, {{almost all of}} them lived in either Ivy City or adjacent Trinidad. Despair was a major issue for residents there. [...] By 1979, almost no Ivy City residents turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in city elections.|$|E
2500|$|Cuba’s {{supporters}} {{argue that}} the Cuban system is more democratic than that used in multi-party democracies. The Cuba Solidarity Campaign, a group based in the United States, says: “Electoral candidates are not chosen by small committees of political parties… Instead the candidates are nominated individually by grass-roots organisations and by individual electors… The successful candidate is chosen by secret ballot. The Electoral Law of 1992 stipulates that delegates to the municipal and provincial assemblies and the 601 deputies to the National Assembly are all elected by popular suffrage using a secret ballot… Unlike the case in other states, which invariably criticize Cuba for being ‘undemocratic’, voter turn-out in Cuba is high. In April 2005, 97.7% of electors came <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for their deputies to the municipal assemblies.” ...|$|E
50|$|Voting members live {{in various}} {{regions in the}} US {{and outside of the}} US {{including}} Latin America, Spain, and Portugal. To be eligible a recording must have at least 51% of its content recorded in Spanish or Portuguese and has been commercially released in North America, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, Spain, or Portugal. Products recorded in languages and dialects such as Catalan, Nahuatl, Quechua, Galician, Valencian, Mayan, may be accepted by majority vote of the committees of the Latin Recording Academy. For instrumental music, the Latin Recording Academy accepts recordings that have been composed or interpreted by an Iberian American musician. The eligibility period is July 1 to June 30 for a respective awards ceremony. Recordings are first entered and then reviewed to determine the awards they are eligible for. Following that, nominating ballots are mailed <b>to</b> <b>voting</b> members of the academy. The votes are tabulated and the five recordings in each category with the most votes become the nominees. Final voting ballots are sent <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>voting</b> members and the winners are determined. Winners are later announced at the Latin Grammy Awards. The current President & CEO of the Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences is Gabriel Abaroa, who is related to Mauricio, one of the founders.|$|R
25|$|Members of the People's Temple leftist {{religious}} cult saturated San Francisco neighborhoods, distributing slate {{cards for}} Moscone, Joseph Freitas and Hongisto. For {{the rest of}} his life, Barbagelata maintained that the People's Temple had committed massive election fraud on behalf of Moscone by bussing people in from <b>out</b> of town <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> multiple times under the names of deceased San Francisco residents.|$|R
40|$|During {{the more}} than thirty years that French women have had the right <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> {{periodic}} surveys have shown that in the political domain their behavior is different from that of men. They are less often interested in politics, they turn <b>out</b> less frequently <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> and when they do vote, {{they are less likely to}} favor candidates of the left. Although the differences recorded today between the political behavior of men and women seem less than during the 1950 's, they are still quite considerable...|$|R
2500|$|The Catalan {{government}} {{estimated that}} polling stations representing up to 770,000 potential voters—14.5% of all registered voters—were closed down by police in raids, with any votes cast in those stations either seized, lost or inaccessible {{and therefore not}} counted. Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull argued that turnout would have been higher {{were it not for}} [...] "Spanish police suppression". Catalan government officials argued that calculation by experts showed that without police pressure and closures, turnout could have reached up to 55%. This was reported as not considering the fact that, as a result of changes implemented by the Catalan government earlier in the day which saw the introduction of a [...] "universal census", any Catalan elector going <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> could do so in any one of the still functioning polling stations. Notorious examples of this included President Puigdemont himself—who voted in Cornella del Terri instead of Sant Julià de Ramis where he was registered to vote, foiling a police operation to track him down along the way—or Parliament of Catalonia Speaker Carme Forcadell.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 August, Rajoy {{announced}} {{his willingness to}} hold negotiations with C's but initially ignored Rivera's conditions, instead setting a meeting between the two leaders the following day to discuss them and which resulted in both of them agreeing to start negotiations. Rajoy, however, warned that even with the hypothetical support from both C's and CC—with which the PP had maintained talks—the 170 votes they would gather {{would not be enough}} to overcome the expected negative votes—180—from all other parties combined, and pointed out that he was still waiting for the PSOE to make a move. Failure in the investiture, he said, would result in a third election which his party would wish to avoid but that it did not discard. That day, the date for the investiture was finally set: the debate would be held on 30 August, with subsequent votes scheduled for 31 August and 2 September. This would mean that, in the event of failure in such a vote, time would start to run and the date for a new election would be automatically set for Christmas Day, 25 December 2016. Both PP and C's tried to use this fact to increase political pressure on PSOE leader Pedro Sánchez, calling for him to choose [...] "whether he wanted people to go <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on 25 December or to choose a responsible abstention that allows government formation".|$|E
2500|$|He {{continued}} {{being an}} outspoken observer of Serbian politics and Serb society in general. In a May 2008 interview, following the Serbian parliamentary election, {{he used the}} fact that the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) of Vojislav Šešelj, Tomislav Nikolić, and Aleksandar Vučić received 1.2 million votes {{as a starting point for}} a wider comment on Serbian society: [...] "Political parties aren't the problem in Serbia. The problem here is the society that votes for those parties. I can't even begin to image what those million people that voted for SRS are like. We need to face the fact we live in a country where 50% of the population is semiliterate, uninformed, and poisoned by the media outlets with nontransparent ownership structure so that we don't know who's financing them. When a person like that gets <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> I'm convinced they don't have the slightest clue who it is they're really voting for. Democracy makes sense only when you've got an economically independent and well informed voter, someone who has the information and is capable of thinking. Simply counting up the votes without really knowing what's behind them is stupidity. I'm sorry, but in Serbs we have the same people that elected Slobodan Milošević on multiple occasions. Big electoral numbers do not impress me at all".|$|E
50|$|When the DLP {{boycotted the}} 1971 General Elections Bhadase {{organised}} the Democratic Liberation Party {{to contest the}} election, but all of his candidates were defeated when the DLP leadership brought <b>out</b> their supporters <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for the People's National Movement candidates rather than see Bhadase's party win.

50|$|However, in 1928, the Democratic Party {{nominated}} Alfred E. Smith, a New York City native, and Roman Catholic of Irish, Italian, and German immigrant heritage, who appealed {{greatly to}} the urban ethnic and Catholic immigrant populations that populated great American cities like New York and Boston. Smith was the first Catholic ever to be nominated for president on a major party presidential ticket, and while Smith’s Catholicism greatly weakened his candidacy in many rural parts of the United States, especially in the South and the Pacific Northwest, Catholics across the United States identified with him greatly. Thus in 1928, a coalition of Irish Catholic and other ethnic immigrant voters primarily based in urban areas turned <b>out</b> massively <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for Al Smith the first Catholic nominee, making Massachusetts and neighboring Rhode Island the only states outside of the Solid South <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> Democratic. Smith won these two traditional Republican bastions even as Herbert Hoover won a third consecutive Republican landslide nationally.|$|R
