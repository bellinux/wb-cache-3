5|$|The first semi-permanent {{inhabitants}} of regions near Antarctica (areas situated {{south of the}} Antarctic Convergence) were British and American sealers who used to spend a year <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> South Georgia, from 1786 onward. During the whaling era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion of Britons. The settlements included Grytviken, Leith Harbour, King Edward Point, Stromness, Husvik, Prince Olav Harbour, Ocean Harbour and Godthul. Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families. Among them was the founder of Grytviken, Captain Carl Anton Larsen, a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who, along with his family, adopted British citizenship in 1910.|$|E

5|$|As Messi {{developed}} into {{a combination of a}} number 8 (a creator), a 9 (scorer), and a 10 (assistant), he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011–12 season, producing a hat-trick <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> 10 occasions. He began the campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups; in the Supercopa de España, he scored three times to achieve a 5–4 aggregate victory over Real Madrid, overtaking Raúl as the competition's all-time top scorer with eight goals. At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4–0 victory over Santos, earning the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament, as he had done two years previously. For his efforts in 2011, he again received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times, after Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten. Additionally, he won the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, a revival of the old-style Ballon d'Or. By then, Messi was already widely considered one of the best footballers in history, alongside players like Diego Maradona and Pelé.|$|E
5|$|The Steam client, {{as part of}} {{a social}} network service, allows users to {{identify}} friends and join groups using the Steam Community feature. Users can use text chat and peer-to-peer VoIP with other users, identify which games their friends and other group members are playing, and join and invite friends to Steamworks-based multiplayer games that support this feature. Users can participate in forums hosted by Valve to discuss Steam games. Each user has a unique page that shows his or her groups and friends, game library including earned achievements, game wishlists, and other social features; users can choose to keep this information private. In January 2010, Valve reported that 10million of the 25million active Steam accounts had signed up to Steam Community. In conjunction with the 2012 Steam Summer Sale, user profiles were updated with Badges reflecting the user's participation in the Steam community and past events. Steam Trading Cards were introduced in beta in May 2013 and were fully supported by June 2013. By playing specific games, players would earn virtual trading cards, which they could trade with friends and use towards gaining rewards on the service such as game discounts, downloadable content, or in-game items, and customize their user profile page. In 2010, the Steam client became an OpenID provider, allowing third-party websites to use a Steam user's identity without requiring the user to expose his or her Steam credentials. In order to prevent abuse, access to most community features is restricted until a one-time payment of at least 5 is made to Valve. This requirement can be fulfilled by making any purchase of five dollars <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> Steam, or by adding at the same amount to their wallet.|$|E

In July 2015, the government submitted its ideas for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the United Nations, and the proposal included a target for nuclear power to meet at least 20% of Japan’s electricity consumption by 2030. Renewable energy sources, such as hydropower but also solar power, would contribute 22% <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> <b>On</b> 11 August 2015, the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant broke a four-year lull when it restarted one of its reactors.

Other significant factors included poor supervision, harsh discipline, large family size, delinquent sibling, young mother, depressed mother, low social class, and poor housing. There has also been association between psychopathy and detrimental treatment by peers. However, {{it is difficult to}} determine the extent of an environmental influence on the development of psychopathy because of evidence of its strong heritability.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Fielder was Kent's leading wicket taker in 1906. He took 172 wickets {{in total}} for Kent during the season, {{including}} 158 in the County Championship {{at an average}} of 19.74. Colin Blythe took 90 championship wickets at 19.16 and 111 wickets in total for Kent during the season despite not being able to play in seven matches due to an injury to his bowling hand. Both Fielder and Blythe took seven wicket hauls during the season, as did Punter Humphreys who returned the best bowling figures of Kent's Championship campaign, 7/33 against Middlesex in June at Tonbridge. Fielder took 10/90 during the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, at the time the only bowler to take 10 wickets in an innings in the fixture, and took six wickets <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> 13 occasions during the season.|$|E
