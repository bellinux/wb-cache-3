5|$|The area rapidly {{changed from}} European American to African-American in the 1920s. By 1930, the {{population}} was only 7.8% white. By 1960, {{the population was}} 0.5% white. From 1950 to 2000 the total population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> declined from 57,000 to 14,146. This population decline {{is partly due to}} initiatives of the Chicago Land Clearance Commission, who acted under the 1955 Amendment to the Blighted Areas Redevelopment Act, which empowered redevelopment authorities that have acquired land by condemnation or otherwise to redevelop such lands for non-residential uses. A good example of the Land Clearing commission activities is the Lake Meadows Park to the north of Washington Park. The failure of the evolution of industry and commerce in the community, the above-mentioned white flight and land redevelopment for non-residential use combined lead to population decline.|$|E
