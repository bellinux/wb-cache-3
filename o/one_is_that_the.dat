5|$|The {{formation}} of the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus, has proven difficult to model precisely. Current models suggest that the matter density in the outer regions of the Solar System was too low {{to account for the}} {{formation of}} such large bodies from the traditionally accepted method of core accretion, and various hypotheses have been advanced to explain their formation. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ice giants were not formed by core accretion but from instabilities within the original protoplanetary disc and later had their atmospheres blasted away by radiation from a nearby massive OB star.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} about why the hoard was buried. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hoard represented a deliberate attempt to keep wealth safe, perhaps in response to one of the many upheavals facing Roman Britain in the early fifth century. This is not the only hypothesis, however. Archaeologist Peter Guest argues that the hoard was buried because the items in it were used as part of a system of gift-exchange, and as Britain separated from the Roman Empire, they were no longer required. A third hypothesis is that the Hoxne Hoard represents the proceeds of a robbery, buried to avoid detection.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} myths {{on the origin}} of the name Dhaka. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name came {{following}} the establishment of Dhakeshwari temple by Raja Ballal Sena in the 12th century and Dhakeswari is the name of a Goddess. While others say that Dhakeshwari stands the meaning of Goddess of Dhaka; so the temple must have been named after the region. Another myths says that the Dhak (a membranophone instrument) is used as part of the Durga Puja festival in this temple and hence the name Dhaka. Yet another one says it came from the plant named Dhak (Butea monosperma) which was widely found in that area.|$|E

30|$|For {{both the}} PLA NPs/FITC-MMC-SPC and PLA NPs/FITC-MMC, the green {{fluorescence}} {{was presented in}} the cell. This finding {{was similar to the}} reported work[46]. It <b>was</b> also reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> premature released FITC or FITC-MMC could be not internalized by the cells[37]. To the result, we proposed two possible reasons, <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> intracellular drug release and transport played a dominate role. A part of drug was released from the NPs and transported inside the cells. Alternatively, <b>the</b> other <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> intracellular drug accumulation and diffusion played a main role. A high nuclear accumulation of FITC-labeled MMC resulted in the subsequent diffusion to other cytoplasmic areas. Regardless of either mechanism, <b>the</b> result confirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> drug delivered to the nuclei resulted from the effective cellular uptake, followed by the efficient intracellular internalization and accumulation of drug.|$|R

25|$|The eldest male at {{the table}} was always served first, {{commonly}} served {{to them in the}} men's quarters by the women of the house. Women usually dined in a separate portion of the house after the men were served. The eldest men or women always ate before the younger family members. The meal was usually quiet, as conversation was discouraged during meals. In modern times, these rules have become lax, as families usually dine together now and use the time to converse. Of the remaining elements of this decorum, <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> younger members of the table should not pick up their chopsticks or start eating before the elders of the table or guests and should not finish eating before the elders or guests finish eating.|$|E
25|$|The 1997 {{report of}} the Belgian Senate stated {{that there was not}} enough {{information}} to determine specifics about the assassination. A 1998 report by the National Assembly of France posited two probable explanations. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> attack was carried out by groups of Hutu extremists, distressed by the advancement of negotiations with the RPF, the political and military adversary of the current regime, while the other is that it was the responsibility of the RPF, frustrated at the lack of progress in the Arusha Accords. Among the other hypotheses that were examined is one that implicates the French military, although there is no clear motive for a French attack on the Rwandan government. The 1998 French report made no determination between the two dominant theories. A 2000 report by the Organisation of African Unity does not attempt to determine responsibility.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{literature}} review writes that studies in several nations {{have found a}} relationship between myopia and higher IQ and between myopia and school achievement. Several, but not all, studies have found hyperopia {{to be associated with}} lower IQ and school achievements. A common explanation for myopia is near-work. Regarding the relationship to IQ, several explanations have been proposed. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> myopic child is better adapted at reading, and reads and studies more, which increases intelligence. The reverse explanation is that the intelligent and studious child reads more which causes myopia. Another is that the myopic child have an advantage at IQ testing which is near work because of less eye strain. Still another explanation is that pleiotropic gene(s) affect the size of both brain and eyes simultaneously. A study of Chinese schoolchildren found that after controlling for age, gender, school, parental myopia, father’s education, and books read per week, myopia was still associated with high nonverbal IQ. Nonverbal IQ was a more important explanation than books read per week.|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} {{of crude oil}} by rail is far from new, but {{it is now a}} rapidly growing market for North American railroads. The growth is driven by several factors. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> transmission pipelines from Alberta are operating at or near capacity and companies who cannot get pipeline space have to move oil by rail instead. Another is that many refineries on the east, west, and Gulf coasts of North America are under-served by pipelines since they assumed that they would obtain their oil by ocean tanker. Producers of new oil in Alberta, North Dakota, and West Texas are now shipping oil by rail to coastal refiners who are having difficulty obtaining international oil at prices competitive with those in the interior of North America. In addition, crude bitumen can be loaded directly into tank cars equipped with steam heating coils, avoiding the need for blending it with expensive condensate in order to ship it to market. Tank cars can also be built to transport condensate on the back-haul from refineries to the oil sands to make additional revenue rather than returning empty.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the harshness of the rule in Lee Mau Seng, academics have offered several suggestions for circumventing it. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> definition of mala fides used by the courts in Lee Mau Seng is actually unreasonableness and not mala fides in the narrow sense of dishonesty or bad faith. In Cannock Chase District Council v. Kelly (1977), Lord Justice Megaw asserted that bad faith is [...] "dishonesty" [...] and [...] "always involves a grave charge". This contrasts with the meaning of mala fides in Lee Mau Seng which includes situations of carelessness or vagueness. Thus, an allegation of bad faith in the narrow sense could permit review by the courts.|$|E
500|$|The {{derivation}} of {{the name}} is uncertain, but several ideas have been proposed. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Eccles" [...] place-name {{is derived from the}} Romano-British Ecles or Eglys, itself derived from the Ancient Greek Ecclesia. [...] Following the arrival in AD613 of the invading Anglo-Saxons at Lancashire, many existing British place-names, especially rivers and hills (the River Irwell for example), survived intact. The root [...] "Ecles", found in several village names, is an exception to this. A popular theory is that the word denoted the site of a building recognised by the Anglo-Saxons as a church and feature of the landscape. Eccles appears to have been such a village, and Ecles may be the likely source of the modern name. [...] In Kenyon's Origins of Lancashire (1991), however, the author suggests that {{this may not be the}} case as there is not an exact correlation between [...] "Eccles" [...] place-names and pre-Domesday hundreds in south Lancashire.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor {{solving the}} {{questions}} the intelligent processing system of {{data in the}} coefficient determination of the thermal conductivity based on MTB (Multimedia ToolBook) had been developed. The questions included {{the accuracy of the}} report results for students. The accuracy could not be checked by teachers. In particular, the questions were in the experiment for the coefficient determination of the thermal conductivity. There were many difficulties when the students developing the intelligent system. The difficulties included how to handle the data of the experiment in extracurricular activities of science and technology. The difficulties were how to obtain the number of the experiment data, how to get the temperature values by interpolation, and how to realize the intelligent look-up-table. The difficulties were studied hard for half year and <b>the</b> intelligent system <b>that</b> guided by <b>the</b> professor had been developed successfully.

2500|$|The {{nature of}} being good {{has been given}} many treatments; <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> good {{is based on the}} natural love, bonding, and affection that begins at the {{earliest}} stages of personal development; another is that goodness is a product of knowing truth. Differing views also exist as to why evil might arise. Many religious and philosophical traditions claim that evil behavior is an aberration that results from the imperfect human condition (e.g. [...] "The Fall of Man"). Sometimes, evil is attributed to the existence of free will and human agency. Some argue that evil itself is ultimately based in an ignorance of truth (i.e., human value, sanctity, divinity). A variety of Enlightenment thinkers have alleged the opposite, by suggesting that evil is learned as a consequence of tyrannical social structures.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{drawbacks}} {{to natural}} management, however. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> breeding date, and hence foaling date, {{of any given}} mare will be uncertain.

[...] Some stallions become very anxious or temperamental in a herd setting and may lose considerable weight, sometimes to the point of a health risk. [...] Some may become highly protective of their mares and thus more aggressive and dangerous to handle. [...] There is also a greater risk that the stallion may escape from a pasture or be stolen. [...] Stallions may break down fences between adjoining fields to fight another stallion or mate with the [...] "wrong" [...] herd of mares, thus putting the pedigree of ensuing foals in question.|$|E
