30|$|During {{non-invasive}} ventilation, patient–ventilator asynchronies {{are frequent}} [21, 22] and mainly related to leaks around the interfaces and/or <b>overassistance.</b> Our mean asynchrony index {{was close to}} that observed in other studies [8, 23]. Non-invasive ventilation algorithms that are implemented in most devices were able to decrease the asynchrony index significantly and might thus be systematically turned on during non-invasive ventilation, {{in an attempt to}} limit non-invasive ventilation failure.|$|E
30|$|Interestingly, {{the peak}} Edi {{in the present}} study was {{relatively}} low (IQR 1.2 – 7.6) as compared to values observed in extubated children, which usually are between 5 and 30  mcV, depending on the lung condition [30, 31]. Many patients had low respiratory drive after several days of intubation, while they were deemed to be actively breathing. We consider this finding as a new form of poor patient–ventilator interaction, although not an asynchrony. This low respiratory activity has previously been reported [14, 32]. It could be the consequence of <b>overassistance,</b> oversedation, their combination, or more rarely of an abnormal output by the central respiratory center or by bilateral phrenic nerve palsy [33, 34]. In this study group, many patients were admitted for nonrespiratory reasons. Even low level of ventilator support can be sufficient in such conditions to suppress the patient breaths [35]. We previously reported that the ventilatory drive increased in these patients after the extubation, so the central or peripheral neurological explanation seems unlikely [31]. Oversedation may have contributed, as suggested by higher degree of comfort observed in these patients. As described by Vaschetto et al., the combination of <b>overassistance</b> and sedation has a synergistic impact on the drive suppression. More attention should be paid to this frequent complication, especially since such respiratory behavior has clearly been linked to diaphragm dysfunction [30, 36, 37].|$|E
40|$|The {{monitoring}} of electrical {{activity of the}} diaphragm (EAdi) is a new minimally invasive bedside technology that was developed for the neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) mode of ventilation.
