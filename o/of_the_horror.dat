5|$|Designed by Steve Brown and Richard Leinfellner, Cauldron {{originated}} as {{a licensed}} video game <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> film Halloween. Brown eventually altered {{the game to}} use a theme based on the Halloween holiday. The mix of two genres resulted from Brown and Leinfellner wanting to make a shoot 'em up and platform game, respectively. The developers realized {{that there were no}} technical limitations preventing the genres from being combined.|$|E
5|$|Lawless was {{attracted}} to the show because of her appreciation for its writing and after hearing the description of her role. She was prominently featured in promotional materials for Salems second season. Lawless based her performance on historical accounts of witches and her childhood love <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> genre. She avoided portraying Ingrid as a villain to focus on making her a more complex character.|$|E

5|$|The film {{received}} an American debut in an edited and dubbed form in 1962 {{under the title}} <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Horror</b> Chamber of Dr. Faustus. In the United States, Faustus was released as a double feature with The Manster (1959). The film's initial critical reception was not overtly positive, but subsequent theatrical and home video re-releases increased its reputation. Modern critics praise the film today for its poetic nature {{as well as being}} a notable influence on other filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{popularity}} of the novel, Gatiss felt a greater responsibility to include familiar elements of the story than he did when adapting the lesser-known stories. The script was intended to follow elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> genre and make the episode scary. As opposed to traditional ghost stories, Gatiss's plot focused on more contemporary horrors, conspiracy theories and genetic modification. Filming was done throughout May 2011, with additional shots taking place as late as August. Location shooting took place mostly across South Wales, though parts were shot in Dartmoor. The hound was created using visual effects.|$|E
5|$|Don't Look Now is {{also very}} well {{regarded}} by other industry professionals, placing in the top 100 on Sight & Sound's directors poll, run in tandem with their critics poll. A survey of 1000 people who work across the film and television industry, undertaken by the British Film Institute in 1999, saw the film ranked eighth on their list of top 100 British films of the 20th century. It also topped a similar list organised by Time Out London in 2011, in which 150 film industry professionals were polled. In 2012 Time Out also undertook a poll <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> industry, {{in which more than}} 100 professionals who work within or have connections to the genre selected their favourite horror films, which saw Don't Look Now finish in twelfth position.|$|E

5|$|Freda {{felt that}} I Vampiri {{did not succeed}} financially in Italy due to the country's {{audience}} reluctance to an Italian interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> genre. For Freda's next film, Caltiki – The Immortal Monster, he used an English pseudonym of Robert Hampton {{to give the impression}} that the film was not Italian. Freda attempted a gothic horror film again five years later with his film The Horrible Dr. Hichcock. Other crew members would go on to direct horror films following I Vampiri, such as screenwriter Piero Regnoli who directed The Playgirls and the Vampire (1960) and Bava who became the cinematographer on Freda's Caltiki as well as directing Black Sunday (1960).|$|E
5|$|Many {{works of}} crime and horror have been set in the Peak. The Terror of Blue John Gap by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930) recounts terrible events at the Blue John mines, and Sherlock Holmes investigates the {{kidnapping}} of {{a child in the}} region in The Adventure of the Priory School. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> stories of local author Robert Murray Gilchrist (1878–1916) feature Peak settings. More recently, Stephen Booth has written a series of crime novels set in various real and imagined Peak locations, while In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner, an Inspector Lynley mystery by Elizabeth George, is set on the fictional Calder Moor.|$|E
5|$|Rockstar, the game's developer, had {{a long-standing}} {{interest}} {{in creating a}} zombie game. They found the Red Dead Redemption universe and its American countryside to fit the cinematic heritage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> film genre. Rockstar wanted their additional content to function outside rather than within the base game's story but draw on its characters and atmosphere. The company released Undead Nightmare as downloadable content for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms on October 26, 2010, and as a standalone retail disc bundle with other downloadable content packs in late November.|$|E

25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{features}} <b>of</b> English anti-Catholicism was <b>the</b> holding <b>of</b> {{public meetings}} at which ex-Catholics, including former priests, denounced their prior beliefs and gave detailed accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> Catholic life. Giacinto Achilli (1803–1860), an ex-Dominican friar, was one such speaker.|$|R
5|$|The Zong killings {{offered a}} {{powerful}} example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slave trade, stimulating <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abolitionist movement in Britain, which dramatically expanded {{in size and}} influence in the late 1780s.

5|$|The pre-Code horror cycle was {{motivated}} by financial necessity. Universal in particular buoyed itself with the production of horror hits such as Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein, then followed those successes up with Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932), The Mummy (1932), and The Old Dark House (1932). Other major studios responded with their own productions. Much like the crime film cycle, however, the intense boom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> cycle was ephemeral, and had fallen off {{at the box office}} {{by the end of the}} pre-Code era.|$|E
5|$|While {{many critics}} refer to film noir as a genre itself, {{others argue that}} it can be no such thing. While noir is often {{associated}} with an urban setting, many classic noirs take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road; setting, therefore, cannot be its genre determinant, as with the Western. Similarly, while the private eye and the femme fatale are character types conventionally identified with noir, the majority of film noirs feature neither; so there is no character basis for genre designation as with the gangster film. Nor does film noir rely on anything as evident as the monstrous or supernatural elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> film, the speculative leaps of the science fiction film, or the song-and-dance routines of the musical.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{revealed}} to be a ghost story inspired by nineteenth-century French fantasy literature, the film uses the conventions of the genre —that people who die in emotional distress or with an unfinished task may become ghosts— and openly details these conventions. Marie and Adrienne's 'lives' as revenants are reduced to a single purpose, each with only {{the memory of her}} suicide and her last emotions remaining. Julien, like the audience, is eventually confronted with Marie's nightmare of repetition. Elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> genre are used, not to scare but to explore memory and loss. To stay with Marie, Julien first has to forget about her, and at the end they have the promise of a new beginning. Marie becomes a living person again rather than an object of fantasy. Marie's tears and blood are a miracle overcoming her death, and may reflect a fantasy of turning back the menopause. The credits are accompanied by an upbeat jazz song performed by Blossom Dearie, Our Day Will Come, that represents love as a pledge, the only music used in the film.|$|E

5|$|Thanks to {{its opening}} weekend of $30.5 million, the film broke the box-office {{record for the}} Labor Day weekend, surpassing the record set in 2005 by Transporter 2 with $20.1 million. It still {{currently}} resides as the top Labor Day weekend grosser. Halloween was also the 8th highest-grossing R-rated film of 2007, and finished out the year in 44th place for domestic box office gross. With its $58 million box office gross, Halloween was the second highest-grossing film among the recent slasher remakes, taken over by A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) with $63 million. However, it is third in the list which consists of When a Stranger Calls (2006) at $47.8 million, Black Christmas (2006) at $16.3 million, Prom Night (2008) at $43.8 million, My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009) with $51.4 million, and Friday the 13th (2009) leading the group with $60 million. Halloween is also ranked eleventh overall when comparing it to all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> remakes, as well as eighth place for all slasher films in general, in unadjusted dollars.|$|E
5|$|Tracy Hickman and Laura Curtis {{married in}} 1977. Soon after, {{while living in}} Provo, Utah, they wrote the adventures Pharaoh and Ravenloft. When they began work on Ravenloft, they felt the vampire {{archetype}} had become overused, trite, and mundane, and decided to create a frightening version of the creature for the module. They play-tested it {{with a group of}} players every Halloween for five years before it was published in 1983 by TSR. The plot combined elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> genre with Dungeons & Dragons conventions for the first time. At the time of Ravenlofts release, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with an alphanumeric code indicating the series to which it belonged. Ravenloft was labeled I6: the sixth in a series of intermediate-level modules for the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD). It consisted of a 32-page book, with separate maps that detailed locations in the adventure scenario.|$|E
5|$|Without speech, the Scoobies {{resort to}} {{gestures}} or writing. Humorous misperceptions arise from this gesturing when, for example, Buffy mimes driving in a stake—as though killing a vampire—too {{close to her}} pelvis, causing the Scoobies to think she is suggesting masturbating to rid the town of The Gentlemen. In the belfry, while Buffy and Riley are fighting The Gentlemen, Buffy indicates that Riley should smash the box from her dream. He misunderstands and breaks a jar beside it, looks up and grins, awaiting Buffy's approval. The clumsiness of the characters' gesturing is in direct contrast to the grace of The Gentlemen, who communicate easily through gestures and other visual signals. Their communication is simple and direct; nods, head tilts, and hand movements, achieve exactly what they want it to. The Scoobies, however, are confused and accomplish {{the opposite of what}} they intend. When they are rendered silent they are also rendered useless, unsure of how to fight The Gentlemen. According to two Buffy essayists, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> stemming from the arrival of The Gentlemen is the silence that makes the people of Sunnydale helpless, easy victims.|$|E

25|$|The series {{continued}} with Scream 2, premiering at Mann's Chinese Theater, followed by general release in December 1997, again written by Williamson {{and directed by}} Craven, released {{less than a year}} after the original film. Like Scream, the film features characters aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> genre and the conventions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> sequel, mocking them while simultaneously falling victim to them. The film again focuses on the character of Sidney Prescott, now a college student, as a series of copycat crimes begin, the killers again using the disguise of Ghostface. The film was financially successful, deviating from its predecessor's worldwide gross by less than US$1 million and receiving similar critical praise for its deconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> film sequel and commentary on the influence of the media in society. The script for Scream 2 was leaked during production revealing the identity of the killers and so the film underwent extensive rewrites, changing the identity of the killers though their motivation remained intact.|$|E
