5|$|A large {{variety of}} {{eggplant}} salads and dips {{are made with}} roasted eggplants. Baba ghanoush, called salat ḥatzilim in Israel, is made with tahina and other seasonings such as garlic, lemon juice, onions, herbs and spices. The eggplant is sometimes grilled over an <b>open</b> <b>flame</b> so that the pulp has a smoky taste. A particularly Israeli variation of the salad is made with mayonnaise called salat ḥatzilim b'mayonnaise. Eggplant salads are also made with yogurt, or with feta cheese, chopped onion and tomato, or {{in the style of}} Romanian Jews, with roasted red pepper.|$|E

5000|$|Before the {{electric}} light, {{the library was}} so dependent on daylight that the sun determined its operating hours. Other technologies before {{the electric}} light were too unstable; <b>open</b> <b>flamed</b> lighting was just too risky because of the fire implications.

25|$|It is {{prohibited}} to use <b>open</b> <b>flames</b> and, in some places, mobile phones on the forecourt of a filling station {{because of the}} risk of igniting gasoline vapor. In the U.S. the fire marshal is responsible for regulations at the gas pump. Most localities ban smoking, <b>open</b> <b>flames</b> and running engines. Since the increased occurrence of static-related fires many stations have warnings about leaving the refueling point.|$|R
25|$|The masonry oven {{is similar}} to a smoke pit; it allows for an <b>open</b> <b>flame</b> but cooks more quickly and uses {{convection}} to cook. Barbecue-baking can also be done in traditional stove-ovens. It can be used to cook meats, breads and other starches, casseroles, and desserts. It uses direct and indirect heat to surround the food with hot air to cook, and can be basted in much the same manner as grilled foods.|$|E
25|$|In the past, grain {{elevators}} sometimes experienced silo explosions. Fine powder {{from the}} millions of grains passing through the facility would accumulate and mix with the oxygen in the air. A spark could spread from one floating particle to the other creating a chain reaction that would destroy the entire structure. (This dispersed-fuel explosion is the mechanism behind fuel-air bombs.) To prevent this, elevators have very rigorous rules against smoking or any other <b>open</b> <b>flame.</b> Many elevators also have various devices installed to maximize ventilation, safeguards against overheating in belt conveyors, legs, bearing, and explosion-proof electrical devices such as electric motors, switches, and lighting.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} 1883 {{that the cause of}} the Doterel {{explosion}} was settled. A surviving crew member of that ship, upon later smelling xerotine siccative while on board , stated that he had smelled it before the 1881 explosion. He explained to authorities that a jar of liquid had cracked while being moved below deck. Subsequent investigation revealed that just before the explosion in Doterel, two men were ordered to throw the jar overboard. While cleaning the leaking explosive liquid from beneath the forward magazine, the men may have broken the rule of not having an <b>open</b> <b>flame</b> below decks. The xerotine siccative exploded first, setting off the huge explosion in the forward magazine, which contained 4 tons and 7 cwt (4,456kg) of explosives.|$|E

25|$|The lights can be candles or oil lamps. Electric {{lights are}} {{sometimes}} used and are acceptable {{in places where}} <b>open</b> <b>flame</b> is not permitted, such as a hospital room, or for the very elderly and infirm; however, those who permit reciting a blessing over electric lamps only allow it if it is incandescent and battery operated (an incandescent flashlight would be acceptable for this purpose), while a blessing may not be recited over a plug-in menorah or lamp. Most Jewish homes have a special candelabrum referred to as either a Chanukiah (the modern Israeli term) or a menorah (the traditional name, simply Hebrew for 'lamp'). Many families use an oil lamp (traditionally filled with olive oil) for Hanukkah. Like the candle Chanukiah, it has eight wicks to light plus the additional shamash light.|$|E
25|$|A {{gridiron}} is a metal grate with {{parallel bars}} typically used for grilling meat, fish, vegetables, or combinations of such foods. It {{may also be}} two such grids, hinged to fold together, to securely hold food while grilling over an <b>open</b> <b>flame.</b> Gridironing is often performed outdoors, using charcoal (real wood or preformed briquettes), wood, or propane gas. The earliest gridiron was a combination hinged gridiron and spider co-invented in 1836 by Amasa and George Sizer of Meriden, Connecticut. U.S. Patent #78 was issued to them jointly on November 14, 1836. The next advancement in the gridiron was a steel wire one was invented and patented in 1889 in New Haven, Connecticut, by William C. Perkins, of the New Haven Wire Goods Company, who received U.S. Patent #408,136 on July 30, 1889, for a hinged gridiron that would hold the meat in place while broiling.|$|E
25|$|Two {{important}} staples in {{the diet}} are seafood and beef, the latter playing {{a larger role in}} the cuisine of Sonora than in the rest of Mexico. Beef is often cooked over an <b>open</b> <b>flame,</b> and Sonorans prefer robust cuts such as brisket and skirt steak. Machaca, or carne seca, is still enjoyed, although refrigeration has eliminated the need to dry meat. Sonora also has a reputation for producing fine cuts of beef, but the lean Spanish cattle of the colonial period have been replaced by Angus, Herefords and Holsteins. Dishes based on or usually containing beef include carne desebrada, carne con rajas verdes, burritos, carne con chile colorado, beef chorizo, carne seca, machaca, menudo, gorditas and meatballs. Seafood is an important staple, especially along the coast as there is a large variety of fish and shellfish in the Gulf of California. Seafood is generally cooked in very simple dishes, such as fish tacos, seafood soups, rice with shrimp or squid and shrimp meatballs. Favored fish include cabrilla, flounder, marlin, sardines, manta rays and various types of jacks.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the end of}} February 303, a fire {{destroyed}} part of {{the imperial}} palace. Galerius convinced Diocletian that the culprits were Christian conspirators who had plotted with palace eunuchs. An investigation into the act was commissioned, but no responsible party was found. Executions followed. The palace eunuchs Dorotheus and Gorgonius were eliminated. One individual, a Peter, was stripped, raised high, and scourged. Salt and vinegar were poured in his wounds, and he was slowly boiled over an <b>open</b> <b>flame.</b> The executions continued until at least April 24, 303, when six individuals, including the bishop Anthimus, were decapitated. The persecution intensified. Now presbyters and other clergymen could be arrested without having even been accused of a crime, and condemned to death. A second fire appeared sixteen days after the first. Galerius left the city, declaring it unsafe. Diocletian would soon follow. Lactantius blamed Galerius's allies for setting the fire; Constantine, in a later reminiscence, would attribute the fire to [...] "lightning from heaven".|$|E
500|$|L'Estrange's balloon descended rapidly {{over the}} rooftops of Woolloomooloo, {{slamming}} {{into a house}} near the corner of Palmer Street and Robinson Lane. L'Estrange managed to disentangle himself and fell first onto a chimney then a shed [...] below. He scrambled down from the rooftops to a waiting mob, who whisked him away to Robinson's hotel on the William Street corner and would not let him leave. At the crash site, during an attempt to free the balloon, the escaping gas was ignited when the resident of the house opened a window {{to see what the}} commotion was and the gas came into contact with the <b>open</b> <b>flame</b> of the room's chandelier. The resulting fireball destroyed the balloon, burnt a number of bystanders and was bright enough to [...] "...cast a brief but vivid illumination over the entire suburb". A panicked crush developed as groups tried to both flee from and rush towards the brief, but extremely bright, conflagration while those further away at the launch site assumed L'Estrange had been killed. Several people were injured in the crush or burned by the fire with one lady reportedly being blinded.|$|E
500|$|On 23 February 303, Diocletian {{ordered that}} the newly built church at Nicomedia be razed. He demanded that its scriptures be burned, and seized its {{precious}} stores for the treasury. The next day, Diocletian's first [...] "Edict against the Christians" [...] was published. The edict ordered {{the destruction of}} Christian scriptures and places of worship across the empire, and prohibited Christians from assembling for worship. Before the end of February, a fire destroyed part of the Imperial palace. Galerius convinced Diocletian that the culprits were Christians, conspirators who had plotted with the eunuchs of the palace. An investigation was commissioned, but no responsible party was found. Executions followed anyway, and the palace eunuchs Dorotheus and Gorgonius were executed. One individual, Peter Cubicularius, was stripped, raised high, and scourged.

500|$|Robinson's {{parents were}} poor tenant farmers {{who worked in}} the tobacco fields as sharecroppers. The family used an outhouse, drew water from a cistern, and did laundry in a {{cast-iron}} tub over an <b>open</b> <b>flame.</b> Their house did not have running water until Robinson was ten years old. When Robinson was born, he was so seriously ill that the doctor was certain he would not survive. He was temporarily paralyzed from birth and his head was misshapen. So likely was Robinson's death that the physician asked Robinson's father Charles for a name for the baby's birth and death certificates. Robinson's parents were young (his mother Imogene was twenty) and they were hoping for a girl. They named the baby [...] "Vicky Gene Robinson" [...] for Charles' father Victor and the baby's mother Imogene. For a long time, Robinson's parents believed the boy would die soon. Much later in life, Robinson's father would tell him he couldn't take any joy in the boy's development because he always thought each step {{was going to be the}} last thing. Robinson's parents were and still are members of a small Disciples of Christ congregation. Robinson describes his childhood as very religious. Robinson had perfect Sunday School attendance for thirteen years.|$|E
500|$|Mammals and fowl must be {{slaughtered}} by {{a trained}} individual (a shochet) using a special method of slaughter, shechita (...) [...] Among other features, shechita slaughter severs the jugular vein, carotid artery, esophagus, and trachea {{in a single}} continuous cutting movement with an unserrated, sharp knife. Failure {{of any of these}} criteria renders the meat of the animal unsuitable. The body must be checked after slaughter to confirm that the animal had no medical condition or defect that would have caused it to die of its own accord within a year, which would make the meat unsuitable. These conditions (treifot) include 70 different categories of injuries, diseases, and abnormalities whose presence renders the animal non-kosher. It is forbidden to consume certain parts of the animal, such as certain fats (chelev) and the sciatic nerves from the legs, the process of excision being done by experts before the meat is sold. As much blood as possible must be removed (...) through the kashering process; this is usually done through soaking and salting the meat, but the liver, as it is rich in blood, is grilled over an <b>open</b> <b>flame.</b> Fish (and kosher locusts, for those who follow the traditions permitting them) must be killed before being eaten, but no particular method has been specified in Jewish law.
