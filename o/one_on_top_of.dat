Lectures were given in escape and evasion and troop commanders and NCO's were given small silk maps of Norway to help with any escape attempt. Another item of escape equipment issued was a pair of trouser fly buttons that, when placed <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the other, became a small compass.|$|E

25|$|Shoelaces are {{typically}} tied {{off at the}} top of the shoe using a simple bow knot. Besides securing the shoe, this also takes up the length of shoelace exposed after tightening. The common bow consists of two half-knots tied <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the other, with the second half-knot looped in order to allow quick untying. When required, the knot can be readily loosened by pulling one or both of the loose ends.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{distinctive}} traits of Milwaukee's residential areas are the neighborhoods full of so-called Polish flats. These are two-family homes with separate entrances, {{but with the}} units stacked <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> another instead of side-by-side. This arrangement enables a family of limited means to purchase both a home and a modestly priced rental apartment unit. Since Polish-American immigrants to the area prized land ownership, this solution, which was prominent in their areas of settlement within the city, came {{to be associated with}} them.|$|E
25|$|The chapel of S. Gregory the Illuminator (formerly the Chapel of the Mother of God - St Astvatzatzin), {{built before}} 1177, stands {{high above the}} road, a hundred meters away from the {{entrance}} to the monastery. It is partly hewed in massive solid rock; its composition was, in all probability, largely influenced by the shape of the cave which existed there. The chapel, rectangular in plan and having a horseshoe-shaped apse, is adjoined, from the east and from the northeast, by passages and annexes hewed at various levels and even <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> another.|$|E

25|$|Southern Pacific road {{switcher}} diesels often had elaborate lighting clusters front and rear, {{with a large}} red Mars Light for emergency signaling, and often two pairs of sealed-beam headlamps, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the cab and the other below the Mars Light on the nose. Starting in the 1970s SP had cab air conditioning on all new locomotives and the unit is visible on the cab roof. Southern Pacific placed large snowplows on the pilots of their {{road switcher}}s for the heavy snowfall on Donner Pass. Many Southern Pacific road switchers had a Nathan-AirChime model P3 or P5 air horn with chords distinct to Southern Pacific locomotives in the western states.|$|E
25|$|The {{ceremonial}} centers {{were always}} built to be visible. The pyramids {{were meant to}} {{stand out from the}} rest of the city, to represent its gods and their powers. Another characteristic feature of the ceremonial centers is historic layers. All of the ceremonial edifices were built in various phases, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the other, to the point that what we now see is usually the last stage of construction. Ultimately, the ceremonial centers were the architectural translation of the identity of each city, as represented by the veneration of their gods and masters. Stelae were common public monuments throughout Mesoamerica, and served to commemorate notable successes, events and dates associated with the rulers and nobility of the various sites.|$|E
25|$|Building of Boca Juniors' current stadium {{began in}} 1938, under the {{supervision}} of Engineer José L. Delpini. Boca played its home matches in the Ferro Carril Oeste ground in Caballito until it was completed in May 25, 1940. A third level was added in 1953, originating then its nickname La Bombonera ('The Chocolate Box'). The stand opposite the Casa Amarilla railway platforms remained mostly undeveloped until 1996, when it was upgraded with new balconies and quite expensive VIP boxes. Three sides of the Bombonera are thus made up of traditional sloping stadium stands, but the fourth side was built vertically, with several seating areas stacked <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the other, the only way that makes it stand into the club premises.|$|E

25|$|Josephus {{states that}} the cakes were placed in two equal piles (rather than rows), as does the Mishnah, which {{describes}} the existence of hollow golden tubes to carry air between the bread, and two golden fork-shaped supports attached to the table, each one to hold up a pile Josephus also {{states that the}} frankincense was placed in two golden cups - <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> each pile; the Mishnah states that a handful of incense was placed in each cup, and the Tosefta states that the cups, called bezikin, had flat bottoms/rims, {{so that they could}} also be placed on the table. According to the Mishnah, while the new bread was being carried in by the four priests, two other priests would carry in replacement cups of incense, and two further priests would go ahead of them to remove the old cups of incense.|$|E
25|$|People try to {{stay awake}} and eat toshikoshisoba, noodles to be eaten at midnight. People also visit Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. Traditionally three are visited. This is called sansha-mairi. In the Imperial Palace at dawn on the 1st, the Emperor {{performs}} the rite of shihōhai (worship of the four-quarters), in which he offers prayers {{for the well-being of}} the nation. On January 2 the public is allowed to enter the inner palace grounds; the only other day this is possible is the Emperor's birthday (December 23). On the 2nd and 3rd days acquaintances visit one another to extend greetings (nenshi) and sip otoso (a spiced rice wine). Some games played at New Year's are karuta (a card game), hanetsuki (similar to badminton), tako age (kiteflying), and komamawashi (spinning tops). These games are played to bring more luck for the year. Exchanging New Year's greeting cards (similar to Christmas Cards) is another important Japanese custom. Also special allowances are given to children, which are called otoshidama. They also decorate their entrances with kagami mochi (two mochi rice balls placed <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the other, with a tangerine on top), and kadomatsu (pine tree decorations).|$|E
