25|$|Throughout European and American history, {{upper class}} and upper-middle-class {{families}} had a prevailing attitude of ignoring their servants {{until they were}} needed for labor. Servants {{were expected to be}} silent and they had little opportunity to report criminal behavior within their own living/work environment. The American system of slavery, even in the post-emancipation era, took expectations of invisibility and powerlessness of servants to the extreme. Enslaved Africans found themselves in a position in which they were left to deal, without support of the law or society, the immoral slavery in the United States.Thus, due to lack of food and no pay, servants would often resort to petty theft. After enslaved blacks were emancipated, they made efforts to move beyond domestic work and manual labor, but many came to the realization that the only work available to them was domestic work or manual labor (both positions paid very little). Barbara Neely draws upon these societal oppressions to be the foundation of Blanche <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lam.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{relative}} friability {{to capture}} a sufficiently large patient population in any one geographic location has traditionally limited research into rare diseases.

40|$|A method {{combining}} the nudging and digital filter techniques is proposed {{to obtain the}} first-guess for a limited area model (<b>LAM).</b> <b>The</b> method consists <b>on</b> <b>the</b> integrate <b>the</b> <b>LAM</b> model starting with a previous run valid at 6 hours before the first-guess target time, over a 12 hours period applying the filter, and nudging, only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first 6 hours span, an analysis valid at the target time produced by a global model. The boundary conditions are also provided by the same global model. The advantages of the method are i) the prognostic fields given by <b>the</b> <b>LAM</b> are corrected by the global analysis consistent with the boundary conditions, and ii) it makes the initialization.

40|$|Respiratory {{waveforms}} {{and their}} derived respiratory rate time-series data can become misaligned {{from each other}} when they are collected by vital signs monitors under sub-optimal field conditions. The monitor-provided waveforms and rates can be re-aligned by independently calculating respiratory rates from the waveforms and then aligning them with the monitor-provided rates. However, substantially different rates may be generated from the same waveform due {{to the presence of}} ambiguous breaths at noisy positions in the waveform. This paper reports a landscape matching (LAM) algorithm to align respiratory rate time-series data with the waveform that they are derived from by using rates that are calculated by different means. The algorithm exploits the intermittent matches between two respiratory rate time series to generate a matching score for an alignment. The best alignment exhibits the highest matching score. The alignment performance of <b>the</b> <b>LAM</b> algorithm is compared to that of a correlation matching (CM) algorithm using field-collected respiratory data. Alignment performance is evaluated by: (1) comparing the ability of the two algorithms to return a shifted waveform to its original, known position; and (2) comparing the percent of points that match between the monitor-provided and calculated respiratory rate time-series data after re-alignment. <b>The</b> <b>LAM</b> alignment algorithm outperforms the CM algorithm in both comparisons at a statistically significant level (p< 0. 05).

[...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album one and a half out of five stars, saying that although it remains similar to Animal Boy in that it features the use of heavy guitars, but asserted that it is [...] "much sharper record" [...] only because it did not overlook the band's [...] "trashy pop roots." [...] He pointed out that their musical style was inconsistent, going on to say that the band could have went about their second decade of music making [...] "more gracefully" [...] but concluded by saying that although it was not as [...] "strong" [...] as 1983's Subterranean Jungle or 1984's Too Tough to Die, it was the last release where the band actually [...] "sounded like they mattered." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "C+" [...] and wrote a shorter review, where he states: [...] "It kills me to say this, but with Richie or whoever <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lam,</b> Dee Dee moonlighting as a punk-rapper, Joey frequenting all-acoustic showcases, and Johnny Johnny, a great band has finally worn down into a day job for night people." ...|$|E
