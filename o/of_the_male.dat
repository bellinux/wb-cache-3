5|$|The {{adult male}} has a dark grey beak and pink eye-rings. The adult female has a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings and ear patches that are whiter and more {{distinctive}} than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male.</b> The feathers of its underparts and underwing coverts have larger white margins than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> {{leading to a}} more barred or scalloped pattern to its plumage. Its legs and feet are a little lighter than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male.</b> Moulting appears {{to take place in}} stages in late summer—some time between January or February and April or May, and is poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|A. c. cervicapra (Linnaeus, 1758) : Known as {{the southeastern}} blackbuck. Occurs in southern, {{eastern and central}} India. The white eye ring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> is narrow above the eye and the leg stripe is well defined and reaches all along the leg.|$|E
5|$|Female rodents play {{an active}} role in {{choosing}} their mates. Factors that contribute to female preference may include the size, dominance and spatial ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male.</b> In the eusocial naked mole rats, a single female monopolizes mating from at least three males.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{wingspan}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> is 18 mm. Females are flightless. <b>The</b> forewings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> are ochreous to creamy-white with a shading {{of light}} brown scales. The hindwings are white. Adults {{have been recorded}} in September and October.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>males</b> {{are roughly}} 20% {{smaller than the}} females, but they are morphologically very similar. However, as in all {{mosquito}} species, <b>the</b> antennae <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> {{in comparison to the}} females are noticeably bushier and contain auditory receptors to detect <b>the</b> characteristic whine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female. <b>The</b> maxillary palps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> are also longer than their proboscis, whereas the females’ maxillary palps are much shorter. (This is typical for <b>the</b> <b>males</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Culicinae.) In addition, <b>the</b> tarsus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hind legs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> is more silvery. Tarsomere IV is roughly 75% silver in <b>the</b> <b>males</b> whereas <b>the</b> females’ is only about 60% silver.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{wingspan}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> {{is about}} 50 mm. Females have reduced wings and are incapable <b>of</b> flight. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> forewings have {{a pattern of}} light and dark fawn.|$|R

5|$|The {{breeding}} male mallard is unmistakable, with {{a glossy}} bottle-green {{head and a}} white collar that demarcates the head from the purple-tinged brown breast, grey-brown wings, and a pale grey belly. The rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> is black, with white-bordered dark tail feathers. The bill <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> is a yellowish-orange tipped with black, {{with that of the}} female generally darker and ranging from black to mottled orange and brown. The female mallard is predominantly mottled, with each individual feather showing sharp contrast from buff to very dark brown, a coloration shared by most female dabbling ducks, and has buff cheeks, eyebrow, throat, and neck, with a darker crown and eye-stripe.|$|E
5|$|The early chansonniers did not {{separate}} the works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> troubadours {{from those of}} the trobairitz. It was only in later Italian and Catalan chansonniers that the works of the trobairitz were found in different sections than those of their male counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{nomenclature}} of Diet (Assembly or Parliament), {{this institution}} should {{in no way}} be construed as a broadly, or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and those that did, such as the Duchy of Baden, based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to a small portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> population. Furthermore, this impractical solution did not reflect the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play {{a pivotal role in}} German politics.|$|E
5|$|Edward's preferment of {{the former}} Lancastrian-supporting Woodville family, {{following}} his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, led Warwick and Clarence to help Margaret depose Edward and return Henry to the throne. Edward and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled, but on their return, Clarence switched sides at the Battle of Barnet, leading {{to the death of}} the Neville brothers. The subsequent Battle of Tewkesbury brought the demise of the last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> line of the Beauforts. The battlefield execution of Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, and the later probable murder of Henry VI extinguished the House of Lancaster.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are easily}} {{distinguished}} from males {{as they have}} a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller cere and nostrils, more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not {{very different from that}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. They tend to resist more and be more aggressive than the male when handled. Nesting females also have a brood patch on the bare skin of the belly.|$|E

5000|$|Males of A. agassizi grow to 89 - 114 mm snout-to-vent length (SVL), while females {{may reach}} 79 - 84 mm SVL. The females, and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males,</b> have spotted heads and grey-brown colouration. <b>The</b> {{remainder}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> have black nuptial crests, grow larger, and have larger testes.

5|$|Fowles's {{presentation}} of Sarah, {{one of the}} most enigmatic female characters in literary history, is also psychoanalytically informed. Fowles himself was interested in the psychology of men and women.The enigma of femininity, myth of masculinity, and impossibility of man-woman relationship are some of the crucial themes. Through Sarah's deliberate spreading of lies about herself and her relationship with Charles, Fowles brilliantly brings about the various aspects of femininity that has the potential to authenticate, threaten, and expose the vanity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> subjects.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the team's six home matches had {{an average}} {{attendance}} of 22,753. In a survey of German football fans, 65percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> and 62percent of the female respondents said {{they were interested in}} women's football. However, this popularity is mostly limited to international matches. Although the number of spectators in the women's Bundesliga has more than doubled since 2003, the average attendance in the 2007–08 season (887) was still less than three percent of that of the men's Bundesliga (38,612).|$|E
5|$|In {{colonies of}} the paper wasp, Polistes chinensis antennalis, workers can lay up to a quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> eggs in the colony. The number of eggs that survived to hatching, however, was minimal {{compared}} to the number produced by the queen. Analysis of the microsatellite markers showed that both queens and workers contributed to policing of worker and queen-laid eggs even in monogynous and monandrous colonies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 23 mm {{for males and}} 21 mm for females.

5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of the United Kingdom, Middlewich's young male {{population}} was decimated during the First World War. The cenotaph, near to the parish church, lists the names of the 136 men who died in that conflict, representing around 10% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> population of the town aged between 15 and 45. Forty-two of Middlewich's inhabitants lost their lives in the Second World War, with a further fatality in the Korean War. The Brunner Mond salt works in Brooks Lane also erected a cenotaph in memory of the 16 men from the works killed in the First World War, and the two who died during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, {{the female}} purple-throated cotinga {{is a dark}} brown with pale buffy margins on the upperparts. The underparts are a buffy {{cinnamon}} with black barring.
