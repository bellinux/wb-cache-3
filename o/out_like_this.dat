2500|$|Self-induced {{hypocapnia}}. [...] Hyperventilation {{leading to}} hypocapnia and subsequent loss of an appropriate urge to breathe is the mechanism behind shallow water blackout. [...] Many practitioners of deep water breath-hold diving use hyperventilation {{with the intention}} of extending their bottom time, so this mechanism is also relevant to deep water blackouts in those cases. If the diver has hyperventilated, the mechanism is essentially that for shallow water blackout but hypoxia is delayed by pressure at depth and sets in only when the pressure drops while surfacing. [...] This explains why divers who black <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> do so very close to the surface on their way up and why they may not have felt any urgency to breathe at all; fit, free-divers ascending from deep dives can black out without any warning.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said he [...] "started <b>out</b> <b>liking</b> <b>this</b> movie, {{while waiting}} for {{something}} really interesting to happen.

[...] He also gave it a [...] "thumbs down" [...] on Ebert & Roeper. [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone noted, [...] "Since it's Wolverine's movie, any X-Men or Women who don't hinge directly on his story get short shrift.
