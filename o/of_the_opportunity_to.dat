5|$|The {{next year}} both archbishops {{travelled}} to Rome for their palliums, where Thomas took advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> ask Pope AlexanderII to decree that the sees of Canterbury and York were equal. Thomas {{also sought to}} have the pope declare that the midland sees of Worcester, Dorchester on Thames, and Lichfieldall south of the River Humberwere part of the Archdiocese of York rather than Canterbury. The 12th-century chronicler Eadmer, a monk at Canterbury, wrote much later that Thomas had resigned and surrendered his archiepiscopal symbols, but they were promptly returned to him by Lanfranc on the pope's orders. The story's partisan source casts some doubt on its accuracy.|$|E

5|$|The two {{versions}} of Ernoul's chronicle tell different stories about John's ascent to the throne of Jerusalem. According to one version, the leading lords of Jerusalem sent envoys to France in 1208 asking Philip II to select a French nobleman as a husband for their queen Maria. Taking advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> rid himself of John, Philip II suggested him. In the other version an unnamed knight encouraged the Jerusalemite lords to select John, who accepted their offer with Philip's consent. John visited Pope Innocent III in Rome. The pope donated 40,000 marks for the defence of the Holy Land, stipulating that John could spend the money only {{with the consent of}} the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem and the grand masters of the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his form}} in 193839, Tallon eagerly awaited {{the arrival of}} England for the 194041 tour of Australia. He was only 23 and {{regarded}} as an almost certain selection following his record-breaking performance with both bat and gloves. However, {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War called a halt to his rise and robbed him <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> represent his country while in his prime as a cricketer; official international cricket did not resume until he was 29. In the meantime, domestic cricket continued in 193940. It was another poor season for Queensland, who won only once and lost their remaining five matches. Tallon scored two fifties before scoring 154 in his last Sheffield Shield innings of the season. This set Victoria a target of 230, but they reached it for the loss of only one wicket. Tallon was selected for The Rest of Australia in a one-off match against New South Wales {{at the end of the}} season, but managed only a duck and eight. He ended the summer with 401 runs at 28.62 and 17 dismissals.|$|E
5|$|Having {{staged a}} coup of New York after {{spreading}} his resources by exploiting Otto's reliance on technology, the Goblin King directly confronts Otto, angry {{that he was}} cheated out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> defeat his enemy, but offering Otto the chance to join him. Otto rejects the offer, but when he finds that he cannot win against the Goblin King's resources, having had his new allies abandon him, and with his faith in his own abilities gone, he sacrifices himself to restore the original Spider-Man's mind. When Spider-Man arrives for the final confrontation, the Goblin King quickly realizes that the original personality is back in control when Spider-Man responds to his nemesis' taunts with his own wisecracks. In the duel that follows, Spider-Man unmasks Goblin King, learning that he has undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance, acting as the CEO of Alchemax and intending to re-establish himself as businessman Mason Banks, now that Norman Osborn has become too publicly known as a supervillain. Spider-Man defeats and strips the villain of his powers with a serum devised by Otto, but Norman manages to escape through the discreet aid of Liz Allan. In hiding once again, he reflects that the various heroes will be unprepared {{for him when he}} returns with his new identity and approach as a businessman, seemingly no longer afflicted by the mental illness associated with the Green Goblin formula.|$|E

Other writers include three acclaimed crime fiction writers from outside of Baltimore: George Pelecanos from Washington, Richard Price from the Bronx and Dennis Lehane from Boston. Reviewers drew comparisons between Price's works (particularly Clockers) and The Wire even before he joined. In addition to writing, Pelecanos served as a producer for the third season. Pelecanos has commented that he was attracted to the project because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> work with Simon. Staff writer Rafael Alvarez penned several episodes' scripts, {{as well as the}} series guidebook The Wire: Truth Be Told. Alvarez is a colleague of Simon's from The Baltimore Sun and a Baltimore native with working experience in the port area. Another city native and independent filmmaker, Joy Lusco, also wrote {{for the show}} in each of its first three seasons. Baltimore Sun writer and political journalist William F.

5|$|Things {{came to a}} head {{in autumn}} 1246, when Kaliman of Bulgaria died, leaving the country {{in the hands of a}} regency for his younger brother Michael Asen (r. 1246–57). Vatatzes quickly {{attacked}} Bulgaria, and within three months captured most of Thrace and all of eastern and northern Macedonia, while Michael II of Epirus also took advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> expand into Albania and northwestern Macedonia. At the close of this campaign in November, as Vatatzes was encamped at Melnik, he was informed of a conspiracy to depose Demetrios and deliver Thessalonica to him in exchange for a chrysobull guaranteeing the traditional rights and privileges of the city. Vatatzes readily granted this, and sent envoys to Demetrios calling for him to appear in person at his camp. Demetrios, suspicious of Vatatzes' intentions, refused, and the Nicaeans marched on Thessalonica. After a few days, the conspirators opened one of the gates to the Nicaean army, and the city was quickly captured. Demetrios was captured and exiled to Lentiana in Bithynia, while Thessalonica and all of Macedonia were placed under the governance of the Grand Domestic Andronikos Palaiologos. Theodore himself, isolated and without power in his refuge at Vodena, apparently remained uninvolved in these events.|$|E
5|$|Varis zos Galvus is crowned Garlean {{emperor and}} begins {{consolidating}} power, lending new urgency {{to the search}} for Ivy. The Braves discover that Ivy is Raubahn's trusted advisor Eline Roaille, who is captured at the gates of a Garlean Castrum. A new Scion, Moenbryda, arrives from Sharlayan and provides critical advice for locating Iceheart. Using her body as a vessel, Iceheart summons Shiva into herself and challenges the Warrior of Light. Though the adventurer's band defeats Shiva, Iceheart escapes, bidding the meddler to consult with Midgardsormr. Based on the player's encounters with Lahabrea and Shiva, Moenbryda hypothesizes that Ascians may be permanently destroyed by trapping their souls within white auracite and cleaving them with a blast of pure aether, much like Hydaelyn's blade of light. Lucia of the Temple Knights requests that the Warrior of Light investigate suspicious activity at the Keeper of the Lake. At its apex, the adventurer discovers that Midgardsormr lives on, slowly regenerating from his apparent death. He divulges that Nidhogg, one of his seven children, has rallied the Dravanian horde to renew their attack on Ishgard. Sensing the hero's connection to Hydaelyn, Midgardsormr invokes an ancient pact with the Mothercrystal and seals away her blessing as a test of the player's worth. The Ascian Nabriales takes advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> infiltrate the Scions' headquarters in pursuit of Louisoix's staff. Moenbryda sacrifices herself to create the blade of light necessary to completely destroy the Ascian.|$|E

5|$|On June 20, 2014, Deadline {{announced}} {{the cast of}} the eight lead characters, along with Freema Agyeman, Naveen Andrews, Daryl Hannah, Alfonso Herrera and Eréndira Ibarra. For the roles of those characters living outside of America, the filmmakers wanted to assemble a cast of international actors that matched the nationality of their respective characters, if possible. For example, Doona Bae, Tina Desai, and Max Riemelt are from Seoul, Mumbai, and Berlin like their respective characters. Because the eight leads share the same birthday, the actors selected were all somewhere between mid-20s and mid-30s. The filmmakers {{wanted to write a}} Chinese, Japanese or Korean character and since the Wachowskis had worked with Bae on Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending before, they decided on creating a Korean character for her. Bae expressed worry to them on signing on Sense8 because the proposed five-season plan could mean she would {{have to be able to}} film action scenes for the next 10 years, which would be difficult if she ever decided to get married and got pregnant. She joined the cast after the showrunners told her not to worry as they would kill off her character for her if that ever happened. Jamie Clayton is a trans woman like the character she plays. She was attracted to Sense8 because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> play a transgender character that was written and directed by a transgender filmmaker, and because she was a fan of science fiction and Straczynski. Tuppence Middleton knew the Wachowskis were writing Sense8 while working with them on Jupiter Ascending but she did not think they would ask her to play a role. Max Riemelt was cast at the recommendation of director Tom Tykwer, who had been wanting to work with the actor for a long time. Daryl Hannah was brought in to read for Whispers, because they were thinking of making him an androgynous character at the time, but when she arrived she was told they'd like her to read for the role of Angelica. In November, Deadline wrote than Christian Oliver had joined the cast as a recurring villain. Oliver said he was excited to play a villain for the Wachowskis for a second time, after Speed Racer. Joe Pantoliano, who previously played in the Wachowskis' Bound and The Matrix, was cast in a small uncredited role as Will's father.|$|E

30|$|To better {{understand}} student and instructor perceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn difficult material in their calculus classes, we explore {{factors related to}} both {{the internal and external}} framing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> course. Since introductory calculus serves many client disciplines and is taught to a large number of students, there are often significant external factors that may guide (or dictate) what material is covered in class and how. From the instructors’ perspective, there are also factors that are more internal to the classroom that guide coverage, such as <b>the</b> instructor’s view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students he or she is teaching. For instructors, teaching a course with a common final and teaching to a very mixed group of perceived student ability levels both negatively impact instructors’ perception of their ability to provide OTLs to all students. We also explored what factors relate to <b>the</b> students’ perceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn provided in class. Our analyses indicate that for the students, being male, having had high school calculus (compared to no previous calculus experience), a belief that they can succeed in mathematics, and more student-centered instruction are all related to positive OTL experience.|$|R
