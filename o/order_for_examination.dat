No study compared probing defects caused by ball-ended probes with sharp explorers during tactile examinations of primary teeth. This exploratory study aimed to compare ultrastructural defects caused by ball-ended probes with sharp explorers during tactile examinations of primary teeth. Methods Forty-nine primary extracted teeth were tactile examined as performed for caries activity assessment. Surfaces were randomly divided into groups based on probe type (ball-ended probe or sharp explorer). Two examiners probed different surfaces using the sharp explorer and the ball-ended probe. The <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>examination</b> was randomly determined. Images were captured using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) before and after probing. Two external examiners evaluated independently the ESEM images and scored them as: 0) no damage, 1) slight marks, 2) distinct marks, 3) marks with discontinuity, 4) enamel break-offs. Multilevel Poisson regression models were used to analyze associations between probing ultrastructural damage and surface type, baseline condition and probe type. Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated with 95  % confidence interval (CI). Results The most common defects observed on the dental surfaces were probing marks without discontinuity (scores 1 and 2). Ball-ended probes caused significantly less severe damage than sharp explorers (PR: 0. 28; CI: 0. 11 – 0. 76, p[*]=[*] 0. 01). Conclusion Ball-ended probes cause less damage than sharp explorers when probing gently dental surfaces of primary teeth...|$|E

We found the odds of active trachoma dropped by 80 % from the first child examined to the last child examined (OR 0. 20, 95 % CI 0. 10 - 0. 4, P< 0. 0001) in the 48 villages in the main trial. This study demonstrates that even if the WHO recommended 80 % treatment coverage is not reached in certain settings, children 0 - 5 years with the greatest probability of ocular Chlamydia have higher odds of receiving attention because they are the first to present. These results suggest there may be diminishing returns when using scarce resources to track down the last few children in a mass treatment program. ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 00792922...|$|R

40|$|President Clinton`s Executive <b>Order</b> 12898 calls <b>for</b> <b>examination</b> of disproportionately {{high and}} adverse impacts to {{minority}} and low-income communities. In addition to demographic mapping, environmental justice analyses should also include quantitative impact assessment to show {{presence or absence}} of disproportionate impacts. This study demonstrates use of a geographic information system (GIS) and a computer model. For this demonstration, a safety analysis report and a computer code were used to develop impact assessment data from a hypothetical facility accident producing a radiological airborne plume. The computer code modeled the plume, plotted dose contours, and provided latitude and longitude coordinates for transfer to the GIS. The GIS integrated and mapped the impact and demographic data toprovide a graphical representation of the plume with respect to the population. Impacts were then analyzed. The GIS was used to estimate the total dose to the exposed population under the plume, the dose to the low-income population under the plume, and the dose to the minority population under the plume. Impacts among the population groups were compared to determine whether a dispropotionate share of the impacts were borne by minority or low-income populations...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{report a}} rare case of acute eosinophilic {{pneumonia}} (AEP) associated with heated rubber fume exposure. Methods: A 31 -year-old Ethiopian man, {{working at a}} rubber plant, was admitted to our hospital because of refractory dyspnea and fever. Computed tomography of the chest showed bilateral interstitial shadows and pleural effusion. We suspected AEP and performed fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Results: The eosinophil fraction was elevated at 59 % in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). From the history of inhalation of heated rubber at the working place and hypereosinophilic counts in the BALF, {{he was given a}} diagnosis of AEP associated with heated rubber fume exposure.

30|$|In <b>order</b> <b>for</b> these imaging <b>examinations</b> {{to be used}} {{effectively}} {{the primary}} care physician should communicate formally with the clinical radiologist outlining the clinical history and potential diagnosis in <b>order</b> <b>for</b> the radiologist to justify the investigation of choice in line with EU 97 / 43 Euratom Directive [13]. Where the investigation requested is considered inappropriate or where a more sophisticated but costly examination is preferred a direct discussion between the primary care physician and the clinical radiologist is of great importance. This, however, {{is unlikely to be}} possible on a regular basis due to time constraints of both parties and, therefore, referral guidelines which may be European or national should be utilised by the primary care physician to minimise inappropriate requests. The radiological report should not only describe the findings and potential diagnoses but should recommend further investigations, including the rationale for the recommendations, and whether more complex and expensive investigations should be undertaken. In some cases this may be followed by a verbal discussion. It is important for the radiologist to identify in the report any positive results that would appear to be irrelevant to the main diagnosis or treatment. It must be recognised that in some cases where a positive investigation result seems unlikely to the radiologist, a negative result is of great value to the primary care physician in reassuring the patient.|$|R
