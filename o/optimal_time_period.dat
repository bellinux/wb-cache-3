The critical period for language claims that there is an <b>optimal</b> <b>time</b> <b>period</b> for humans to acquire language, and after this time language acquisition is more difficult (though not impossible). Language attrition also seems to have a time period; before around age 12, a first language is most susceptible to attrition if there is reduced exposure to that language.

With the constraint that the resource can be used by at most one user in each time slot, we would like to find a schedule with a minimal time period (number of time slots), in which each user is served once in a fixed number of time slots according to its required total number of times. As many other variants of periodic-{{scheduling problem}}s, we first prove that the problem is NP-hard.

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Global time {{synchronization}} is an important function that enables all devices in a network to have a unified time. In traditional wireless ad hoc networks, since the spectrum is always available, the global time synchronization process usually can be performed without any interruption. However, in cognitive radio (CR) ad hoc networks, the global time synchronization process among secondary users may fail due to the dynamic spectrum availability. Therefore, the network performance will be significantly affected if time synchronization fails. In this paper, the unique challenges in global time synchronization in CR ad hoc networks are addressed. A novel distributed global time synchronization protocol is proposed considering the unique features of CR ad hoc networks such as the traffic and the topology of primary users (PUs). An optimal root node (i. e., the node which provides the reference time) selection scheme and an <b>optimal</b> <b>time</b> synchronization <b>period</b> are designed. Moreover, under the proposed optimal root node and the <b>optimal</b> <b>time</b> synchronization <b>period,</b> the synchronization delay {{and the impact of}} PUs on the global time synchronization performance are reduced dramatically.

Methods: Oxygen consumption (VO 2) was measured continuously for 24  h using indirect calorimetry. Twenty-two premature infants with gestational age of 27 – 31 (31 ± 1. 7) weeks {{were enrolled in the}} study. Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, skin and rectal temperature and physical activity were monitored continuously. Results: The averaged values of VO 2 showed a significant pattern (P&# 60; 0. 0001) of circadian rhythm with a peak in the afternoon and a nadir during the night with significantly differences between the mean VO 2 values. A circadian variation of VO 2 was found in more than 80 % of preterm infants and was unrelated to gestational age, physical activity or environmental stress. The infants spent 90. 4 % of their time sleeping. Conclusions: These findings indicate the possible existence of an endogenous circadian rhythm of VO 2 in preterm infants beginning shortly after birth. Day-night variations of VO 2 should be considered when VO 2 values are extrapolated from short measurement periods to prevent overestimation of values. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

The essence of the proposed algorithm is to ensure fairness in EH-DL timing schedules among the system sensor nodes. In addition, it is aimed to achieve an enhanced rate of information transfer among the network sensor nodes in the UL. To achieve this, the proposed algorithm optimizes the energy and information transfer timing schedules in a joint fashion, according to the mathematical models presented in Section 3 such that optimal time periods are allocated for both EH and information transmission to classes A and B in the network. As a consequence, Algorithm  1 optimally allots an IPS c to individual sensor nodes at a calculated <b>optimal</b> <b>time</b> <b>period.</b> In a similar vein, {{to make sure that}} the sensors in the network are provided with sufficient time for communications in the UL phase, an optimal information transmission time period is calculated and allotted.

Muscle protein synthesis was significantly decreased at 4 h and the effect was maximal by 12 h; liver protein synthesis was elevated at 12 h and 24 h. The dose-response of muscle protein synthesis to a 30 min infusion with 0 - 150 munits of insulin/h was then compared in rats pretreated with corticosterone (10 mg/ 100 g body wt.) or vehicle alone.

This limits its applications in rapidly developing areas which are cloudy, such as the Pearl River Delta in China. These areas also need to detect land use changes in short intervals, such as on a monthly basis, in order to monitor illegal land use changes and prevent irreversible land use changes that may damage the environment. The objective of the thesis is to examine short-interval land use change detection, especially the change from agriculture to built-up areas, using RADARSAT- 1 images which can go through clouds. This thesis firstly examines the classification of RADARSAT- 1 images with pixel-based and object-based classification methods respectively. Based on the classification results, post-classification change detection method are conducted in order to obtain the detailed information of land use changes for the analysis of short-interval land use change. Land use change detection accuracies can be improved as the number of the RADARSAT- 1 images used in land use change detection increased. More images, which represent longer monitoring period, can obtain better results of land use change detection. For short-interval land use changes detection, four <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> is the maximum otherwise the period of monitoring will be too long. Agricultural activities such as planting and harvesting have significant effects on the monitoring of land use changes. In planting and harvesting months, the accuracies of the land use change detection are lower than other months because its land cover is often confused with other land uses, such as water and bare soils. The process of construction can be considered as a three-stage process and a combination of two land uses. However, construction sites are often confused with vegetation and bare soil in RADARSAT- 1 images because the values of backscatter coefficients of construction sites and the two land uses are very similar. The land cover changes during the planting and harvest seasons are often confused with the process of construction. It is found that construction sites can be identified with their two stages of low values of backscatter coefficients, which is not found in the pattern curves of backscatter coefficients of other land uses. By the comparison of the accuracies of identifying construction sites using two, three and four RADARSAT- 1 images, it is found that using three <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> can get better accuracies which is different from the result of general land use change detection. This thesis does not try to evaluate land use change detection methods or find the best method for monitoring land use changes. Instead, it focused on the analysis of confusions caused by the <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> of land use change detection and seasonal variation of vegetations. The main contributions of this study are as follows: 1) it explores the use of multi-temporal RADARSAT- 1 images into the land use change detection to overcome the problems of cloudy conditions, making short-interval land use change detection possible for areas which are often covered by clouds; 2) pixel-based maximum likelihood method and the object-based classification method were compared for their accuracies in land use classification of RADARSAT- 1 images; 3) it examines the <b>optimal</b> <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> for land use change detection; and 4) it examines the appropriate number of images that are needed for monitoring land use changes in different seasons in order to obtain the best accuracies. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Feed costs are a major input to aquaculture production systems, and genetic improvement in FCE may therefore have an important influence on profitability. FCE is usually expressed by a composite measure that combines feed intake and growth rate. The two most common measures are feed conversion ratio (feed intake/weight gain over a specified time interval) and its inverse, feed efficiency. Feed conversion ratio and feed efficiency are measures of gross FCE, {{because they do not}} distinguish between the separate energy requirements of growth and maintenance. There is abundant evidence of substantial genetic variation in FCE and its component traits in terrestrial livestock species and, although data are few, the same is likely for cultured fish species. The major problems with selecting from this variation to genetically improve FCE in fish species are: It appears impractical to measure feed intake on individual fish, so that family mean data must be used. We do not know the <b>optimal</b> <b>time</b> <b>period</b> over which to test fish for FCE. We do not know the genetic correlations between FCE under apparent satiation or restricted intake conditions, or between FCE at different times in the production cycle. If these problems can be overcome, selection to improve FCE might be best achieved by measuring feed intake of growing animals, and by utilizing genetic correlations that are likely to exist between feed intake and other production traits to develop a weighted selection index...|$|E
40|$|Safety and {{feasibility}} of tumor targeting with radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies was studied in 28 patients {{suspected of having}} ovarian carcinoma, after i. v. administration of 1 mg F(ab') 2 fragments of the murine monoclonal antibody OV-TL 3, labeled with 150 MBq Indium- 111. There were no adverse reactions, hematological and biochemical serum parameters were stable. In one patient a (subclinical) HAMA-response was found. Plasma clearance of the immunoconjugate was biphasic with half lives of t(1 / 2) }alpha = 1. 4 +/- 0. 8 h and t(1 / 2) }beta = 25. 1 +/- 3. 7 h, resulting in an <b>optimal</b> <b>time</b> <b>period</b> for immunoscintigraphy at 24 - 48 h after administration. In 20 patients, undergoing extensive explorative surgery, a total of 271 samples of tumorous and normal tissues were analyzed for radiolabel uptake and tumor presence. The mean uptake in tumor deposits was 5. 6 times (range 2. 2 - 19. 3) {{as high as the}} uptake in normal tissues (fat, peritoneum, muscle, skin). The diagnostic accuracy of immunosctigraphy was compared with that obtained with computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography and physical examination. While pelvic localizations were equally well detected by all methods, 48 % of the abdominally located tumor deposits were correctly diagnosed by immunoscintigraphy, with only 12 % detected by ultrasonography, 8 % by CT-scanning and physical examination, and 6 % by MRI. Immunoscintigraphy has potential as a diagnostic tool in ovarian cancer patients and biolocalization results justify further research into the therapeutic application of labeled monoclonal antibodie...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a firm's decision to replace an existing production technology with a new, more cost-efficient one. Kulatilaka and Perotti [1998, Management Science] find that, in a two-period model, increased product market uncertainty could encourage {{the firm to}} invest strategically in the new technology. This paper extends their framework to a continuous-time model which adds flexibility in timing of the investment decision. This flexibility introduces an option value of waiting which increases with uncertainty. In contrast with the two-period model, despite {{the existence of the}} strategic option of becoming a market leader due to a lower marginal cost, more uncertainty always increases the expected time to invest. Furthermore, it is shown that under increased uncertainty the probability that the firm finds it optimal to invest within a given <b>time</b> <b>period</b> always decreases for <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> longer than the <b>optimal</b> <b>time</b> to invest in a deterministic case.

30|$|Different from [36], equal <b>optimal</b> EH <b>time</b> is {{provided}} to the sensor nodes in class A network because of their nearness to the IPS, while a new parameter TEH is introduced to allot different energy harvesting periods to class B sensors based on their distance from the IPS. Based on the new harvesting <b>time</b> <b>period</b> parameter, an <b>optimal</b> shorter <b>time</b> is allotted to the class B sensors that are near to the IPS, while an <b>optimal</b> larger <b>time</b> is allotted to the class B sensors that are far from the IPS in the downlink (DL). Moreover, to achieve similar signal communication rates within the sensor nodes in the uplink (UL), the sensors which are considered far from the BS are allocated a longer information transmission time {{to ensure that they}} have enough time to transfer their separate signals. To achieve this, a new algorithm is proposed to achieve efficient allocation of <b>optimal</b> harvesting <b>time</b> to individual sensors based on their class of network, in order to enhance the system overall throughput rate.|$|R
