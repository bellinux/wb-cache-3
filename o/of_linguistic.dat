5|$|When {{speaking}} of {{language as a}} general concept, definitions can be used which stress {{different aspects of the}} phenomenon. These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools <b>of</b> <b>linguistic</b> theory. Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as Gorgias and Plato debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.|$|E

5|$|Each {{attempt to}} answer the mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers in the tradition <b>of</b> <b>linguistic</b> criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. They {{argue that it is}} an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle <b>of</b> <b>linguistic</b> relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Italian, {{the majority of}} the population speak fluent Ampezzano, a local variant of Ladin, now recognized as a language rather than a dialect.

The community is also proud of its Ladin or Tyrolean culture, that continues to survive despite the increasing pressure it has faced in recent years. Its importance is even beginning to be recognized by the local authorities who in December 2007 decided to use Ladin on signs for the names of streets and villages, in compliance with regulations for the protection <b>of</b> <b>linguistic</b> minorities in force since 1999.|$|E

5|$|Linguist Derek Bickerton, {{building}} {{on the work of}} biologist Bernd Heinrich, has argued that ravens are one of only four known animals (the others being bees, ants, and humans) who have demonstrated displacement, the capacity to communicate about objects or events that are distant in space or time from the communication. Young, unmated common ravens roost together at night, but usually forage alone during the day. However, when one discovers a large carcass guarded by a pair of adult ravens, the unmated raven will return to the roost and communicate the find. The following day, a flock of unmated ravens will fly to the carcass and chase off the adults. Bickerton argues that the advent <b>of</b> <b>linguistic</b> displacement was perhaps the most important event in the evolution of human language, and that ravens are the only other vertebrate to share this with humans.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{discussion}} in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called analytic philosophy (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy). Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of continental philosophy. In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, {{in relation to the}} philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label (phenomenology, existentialism, etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience.

5|$|One {{important}} source of language change is contact and resulting diffusion <b>of</b> <b>linguistic</b> traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers {{of two or more}} languages or varieties interact on a regular basis. Multilingualism is likely to have been the norm throughout human history and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the ethno-national state, monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{properties}} that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning {{that there is no}} predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number <b>of</b> <b>linguistic</b> elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.|$|E
5|$|Some {{proponents of}} Saussure's view of {{language}} have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements {{and then by}} presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars. Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature {{of the human mind}} and to constitute the rudiments of what language is. By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal logic, in formal theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics. In the philosophy of language, the view <b>of</b> <b>linguistic</b> meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{recall the}} concept <b>of</b> a <b>linguistic</b> {{variable}} and {{the representation of}} its values (i. e. linguistic terms) by means of fuzzy sets.
