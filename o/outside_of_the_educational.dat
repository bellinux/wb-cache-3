30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{while this is}} a field that likes to talk {{continuously}} about learning, it is striking how little of substance is said on the topic. Indeed, it is striking how {{little is known about}} the relationships between technology use and learning. Many discussions of education technology appear remarkably incurious about how learning might actually take place. Much work on technology-based learning appears unconnected to an explicit model of learning, and even those studies that do make reference to learning theories often do not fully follow this through. When learning theory is used there is an overreliance on ‘pre-digital’ theories of learning more suited to mid-twentieth century European classrooms than contemporary digital settings. Moreover, popular ‘theories’ of digital learning (such as connectivism and connected learning) are little more than flat descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> logistics <b>of</b> online information seeking and communication.

Thereafter we provide a critical case study of a schools-based peer education program in a South African township school, drawing on a longitudinal case study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program, and interviews and focus groups with young people in the township. Our research highlights a number <b>of</b> features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program itself, as well as the broader context within which it was implemented, which are likely to undermine <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> critical thinking and empowerment which we argue are key preconditions for program success.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the use of}} {{portfolios}} to assess and evaluate fine arts students is examined. It is argued that {{the best and most}} authentic form of evaluation in the fine arts is the ungraded fine arts portfolio. A philosophical overview of the debate is presented by examining traditional versus progressive models of education. Literature reviews present the background of research surrounding both portfolio assessment in education and the use of letter grades. The argument for ungraded portfolios proceeds with an examination of how art is assessed and evaluated ‘authentically’ within the field <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>educational</b> context, a review of the history of assessment in fine arts within and outside of the realm of public education, an examination of the interplay between creativity, student motivation and assessment and an overview of curriculum theory as it relates to assessment in the fine arts. Examples of the classroom use of ungraded fine arts portfolios are presented, with concrete suggestions on how to proceed. Discussions include the use of digital formats, what to include in the portfolio, collaborative planning with the students, emphasizing metacognitive processes, goal-setting and self assessment in the portfolios and creating a culture of art in the classroom with the portfolios as a central component. In conclusion, there is a discussion of how to adapt the ungraded fine arts portfolio for use should letter grades be required institutionally...|$|E
40|$|Many {{educators}} are currently interested in using computer-mediated communications to support learning and creative practice in various fields. In my work I {{have been looking}} at how we might create drama through using cyberspaces, working with teachers and students in secondary school contexts. In trying to understand issues that have arisen and ways of working with the data I have found a number of frameworks helpful for analysing the online interactions. These frameworks draw from O’Toole’s work on contexts negotiated in the creation of drama and other frameworks drawn from Bakhtin and Vygotsky’s work on speech utterances, dialogic processes and internalisation of learning. What has emerged has been the understanding that whilst students may regularly use various online spaces <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>educational</b> context, this doesn’t mean they will automatically know how to communicate with others in ‘similar but different’ spaces used for learning. The contexts and factors which must be negotiated are quite complex and educators may need to provide parameters and protocols to ensure appropriate languages, genres and utterances are utilised. It would seem that there is also real value in finding ways to use the specific ‘dramatic’ or fictional frame which provides participants with the permission to take on roles that may be quite different to their own, to experiment and to explore possible situations that they never would ‘in real life’ (IRL). This paper is of relevance to those whose research strategies may involve the use of computer-mediated communications as well as those utilising cyberspaces in their creative practice...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess <b>the</b> {{feasibility}} <b>of</b> evaluation for appropriate use of radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in multiple clinical sites and to determine use patterns as well as identify areas of apparent inappropriate use. BackgroundAlthough cardiac imaging is highly valued for decision-making, the growth and expense related to these procedures has raised questions regarding overuse. <b>The</b> publication <b>of</b> appropriate use criteria (AUC), including those for MPI, were designed to provide guidance in <b>the</b> rational use <b>of</b> testing. However, limited data regarding the implementation and evaluation of AUC are available. MethodsSix diverse clinical sites enrolled consecutive patients undergoing MPI, collecting point-of-service data entered into an online form. An automated algorithm assigned a specific indication from the AUC that was classified as appropriate, uncertain, or inappropriate. Site-specific feedback was later provided to each practice on ordering patterns. ResultsOf the 6, 351 patients enrolled, 93 % were successfully assigned an appropriateness level. Inappropriate use of MPI was found in 14. 4 % of patients, with a range of 4 % to 22 % among practices. Women and younger patients were more likely to undergo inappropriate MPI. Asymptomatic, low-risk patients accounted for 44. 5 % of inappropriate testing. Elimination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 5 most common inappropriate use indications would reduce overall imaging volume by 13. 2 %. Inappropriate use by physicians from within the practice performing imaging was not greater than physicians <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practice. <b>Educational</b> feedback might have resulted in reduced inappropriate test ordering in 1 site. ConclusionsThe tracking of appropriate use is feasible in clinical practice, with an automated system that can readily identify practice patterns and targets for educational and quality improvement initiatives. This approach might provide an alternative to utilization management...|$|R

The study meets the need for research both on <b>the</b> musical practice <b>of</b> adult amateurs, as well as their learning <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional musical <b>educational</b> institutions. <b>The</b> main research questions were concerned with the interplay between the musical and <b>the</b> social aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choir practice, and on how participating in a local choir contributes to <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> learning and identity. The study was grounded in earlier choir research as well as music educational theory concerning informal arenas for learning. The study’s theoretical framework was founded on theories of situated learning and in particular theory of communities of practice, but perspectives of sociology and anthropology also informed the work. The research was designed as a case study, combining mainly participant observation, interviews with choir members and document analysis. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main fields <b>of</b> analysis dealt primarily with <b>the</b> examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role played by the choir in its local community, and how <b>the</b> activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choir serve to strengthen <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> local belonging. <b>The</b> results indicate that the choir members learn how to be inhabitants of their local community through participation, thereby implicating learning and <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> identity and belonging related to place. The social interaction within the choir and various aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> musical interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choir practice were also subject to analysis. Results point to the dependence on and the tensions between the musical and the social interaction, which cause both harmony and disharmony to mark the choir practice. The practice embodies both positive energies such as collaboration and reciprocity, all the while also containing more negative forces like tensions, negotiations and conflicts. The study shows that learning and development in various areas constitute one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main implications <b>of</b> participation in a choir, which may, in turn lead to an increased quality <b>of</b> life. <b>The</b> results also demonstrate how a local choir constitutes a multifaceted institution in which several different elements interact, and how the balance between them is vital for <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choir. Consequently <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> a comprehensive and contextual perspective is of great importance when dealing with amateur choir practice...|$|R
