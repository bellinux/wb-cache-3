5|$|During {{the regular}} season, the Maryland defense had allowed <b>opponents</b> <b>to</b> score 31points in ten games and {{recorded}} six defensive shut-outs. Only Georgia {{had been able}} to score more than seven points. No ACC team has since held <b>opponents</b> <b>to</b> an equal or lesser amount of points. Maryland's rushing defense (83.9yards allowed per game) and scoring defense (3.1points allowed per game) ranked first in the nation. Maryland had outscored its opponents 298–31. No ACC team scored more total points until 1967. Maryland's star quarterback, Bernie Faloney, had been injured midseason and saw limited game action {{for the remainder of the}} year. Back-up quarterback Charlie Boxold filled in for the majority of the Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of his}} career, Fischer was {{predictable}} in his use of openings {{and variations}} of those openings. Despite this seeming disadvantage, {{it was very difficult}} for <b>opponents</b> <b>to</b> exploit this limitation, because Fischer's knowledge of the openings and variations that he used was extensive.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay {{does not}} differ {{much from the}} {{previous}} title. Aside from the different circuits and new weapons, the fundamental aspects were kept. Pilots race each other or computer-controlled A.I. <b>opponents</b> <b>to</b> finish in the highest position possible.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the season, Maryland outscored its opponents 381–74, {{accumulated}} three shutout wins, and held seven <b>opponents</b> <b>to</b> 7 points or less. It was Maryland's first 10-win season and remains the team's only perfect undefeated season in the modern era.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{encryption}} key {{may be used}} as part of circumvention technology forbidden by the DMCA, its possession and distribution has been viewed as illegal by the AACS, as well as by some legal professionals. Since it is a 128-bit numerical value, it was dubbed an illegal number. <b>Opponents</b> <b>to</b> the expansion of the scope of copyright criticize the idea of making a particular number illegal.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the world}} wars, chess was {{revolutionized}} {{by the new}} theoretical school of so-called hypermodernists like Aron Nimzowitsch and Richard Réti. They advocated controlling {{the center of the}} board with distant pieces rather than with pawns, which invited <b>opponents</b> <b>to</b> occupy the center with pawns, which become objects of attack.|$|E

He debuted for the {{promotion}} by defeating Atlas DaBone, and in the following months began a feud with K.C. James. Hager began teaming with a multitude of <b>opponents</b> <b>to</b> feud with James and his tag team partner Cassidy James. During {{his time in the}} developmental territories he appeared as a security guard during a brawl between John Cena and Umaga on Raw.|$|E

5|$|In mid-August, Yost moved Braun {{from third}} in the batting order to cleanup, {{switching}} him with Prince Fielder. The move was expected to allow Braun to steal more, as batting before Fielder was not conducive to him risking being thrown out on steal attempts. Additionally, successfully stealing a base would hypothetically allow <b>opponents</b> <b>to</b> intentionally walk Fielder and avoid pitching to him. At {{the end of the}} month, however, Yost reverted to his previous batting order.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, Magna Carta became {{increasingly}} {{important as a}} political document in arguments over {{the authority of the}} English monarchy. James I and Charles I both propounded greater authority for the Crown, justified by the doctrine of the divine right of kings, and Magna Carta was cited extensively by their <b>opponents</b> <b>to</b> challenge the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Most {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} {{did not differ from}} the previous two titles. Wipeout is based on a futuristic anti-gravity setting where pilots would race against each other or computer-controlled AI <b>opponents</b> <b>to</b> finish in the highest position possible. Wipeout gameplay takes inspiration from Formula One parallels; rather than using aerodynamics to increase wheel grip by down-force for faster turning speeds, Wipeout uses a fictionalised method of air braking for ever greater turning force.|$|E

5|$|On November 9, 1901, undefeated Michigan {{faced an}} undefeated Ohio State {{team that had}} allowed <b>opponents</b> <b>to</b> score only five points in its five {{previous}} games. The 1901 game was the third meeting in {{what would become the}} Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry, with the two teams having played to a scoreless tie in their prior match in 1900.|$|E
5|$|<b>Opponents</b> <b>to</b> the {{shut-down}} {{maintained that}} most of the animals were unable to survive in the wild and would perish, and that the zoo's facilities had become one of the last possibilities for future generations of Navajos to see the sacred creatures and thereby relate to traditional stories, {{due to the fact that}} most younger Navajos are more accustomed to dealing with domesticated livestock rather than untamed animals.|$|E
5|$|Although the Boleyn {{family still}} held {{important}} {{positions on the}} Privy Council, Anne had many enemies, including the Duke of Suffolk. Even her own uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, had come to resent her attitude to her power. The Boleyns preferred France over the Emperor as a potential ally, but the King's favour had swung towards the latter (partly because of Cromwell), damaging the family's influence. Also opposed to Anne were supporters of reconciliation with Princess Mary (among them the former supporters of Catherine), who had reached maturity. A second annulment was now a real possibility, although it is commonly {{believed that it was}} Cromwell's anti-Boleyn influence that led <b>opponents</b> <b>to</b> look for a way of having her executed.|$|E
50|$|The two {{kings of}} each player are marked differently. (For example, of a player's two kings, {{one might be}} marked with a star.)

It is not {{permitted}} to check the opponents' other kings.|$|R

5|$|As the condor's {{population}} {{continued to}} decline, discussion began about starting a captive breeding {{program for the}} birds. <b>Opponents</b> <b>to</b> this plan argued that the condors {{had the right to}} freedom, that capturing all of the condors would change the species' habits forever, and that the cost was too great. However, the project received the approval of the United States government, and the capture of the remaining wild condors was completed on Easter Sunday 1987, when AC-9, the last wild condor, was captured. At that point, there were only 22 condors in existence, all in captivity.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, {{the first}} {{proposal}} was launched {{for using a}} bus service {{as an alternative to}} the train. This was rejected because buses were not able to give the comfort and reliability of a train. The idea was proposed again in 1922 by the director of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. Among the strongest <b>opponents</b> <b>to</b> the bus alternative was Ingolf Elster Christensen, County Governor of Sogn og Fjordane and later parliamentarian, who stated that the Nordre Bergenhus County (today Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality) had paid part of the regional financing of the Bergen Line on condition that they receive a branch line to the Sognefjord.|$|E
5|$|In July 2001, Lita and Trish Stratus {{joined forces}} to combat Stacy Keibler and Torrie Wilson, members of The Alliance: Extreme Championship Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling wrestlers who were invading the WWF as part of The Invasion storyline. At the Invasion {{pay-per-view}} on July 22, Lita and Stratus defeated Keibler and Wilson in the first ever tag team bra and panties match by stripping their <b>opponents</b> <b>to</b> their underwear. Throughout The Invasion, Lita, Stratus, and Jacqueline feuded with Alliance members Keibler, Wilson, Ivory, and Mighty Molly. The Invasion storyline ended on November 18 at Survivor Series, where Lita {{took part in a}} six-pack challenge for the WWF Women's Championship, which had been vacated by Chyna earlier that month; Stratus won the match and the title.|$|E
