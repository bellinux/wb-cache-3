50|$|Cornstarch {{is used as}} a {{thickening}} agent in liquid-based foods (e.g., soup, sauces, gravies, custard), usually by mixing it with a lower-temperature liquid to form a paste or slurry. It is sometimes preferred over flour alone because it forms a translucent, rather than opaque mixture. As the starch is heated, the molecular chains unravel, allowing them to collide with <b>other</b> <b>starch</b> chains to form a mesh, thickening the liquid (Starch gelatinization).|$|R
50|$|Liberian cuisine {{has been}} {{influenced}} by contact, trade and colonization from the United States, especially foods from the American South (Southern food), interwoven with traditional West African foods.

50|$|In some cultures, {{instead of}} germinating the maize {{to release the}} {{starches}} therein, the maize is ground, moistened in the chicha maker's mouth, and formed into small balls, which are then flattened and laid out to dry. Naturally occurring ptyalin enzymes in the maker's saliva catalyses the breakdown of starch in the maize into maltose. (This process of chewing grains or <b>other</b> <b>starches</b> {{was used in the}} production of alcoholic beverages in pre-modern cultures around the world, including, for example, sake in Japan.) Chicha prepared in this manner is known as Chicha de Muko.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} making papier-mâché adhesive {{is to use}} a mixture of water and flour or <b>other</b> <b>starch,</b> mixed to the consistency of heavy cream. Other adhesives can be used if thinned to a similar texture, such as polyvinyl acetate-based glues (wood glue or, in the United States, white Elmer's glue). Adding oil of cloves or other additives such as salt to the mixture reduces the chances of the product developing mold.|$|R

30|$|It {{has been}} shown from the chain length {{distributions}} (CLDs) that amylose chains {{can be divided into}} at least two groups: long and short amylose chains. These molecular structures influence some functional properties of starch, such as digestibility and mouth-feel. GBSSI is the key enzyme for the elongation of amylose chains; however, the effect of <b>other</b> <b>starch</b> biosynthesis enzymes in amylose synthesis is still not fully understood. Two advanced starch characterization techniques, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and fluorophore-assissted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE), together with a newly developed starch biosynthesis model, are used to improve understanding of amylose biosynthesis.|$|R

50|$|Starch {{gelatinization}} occurs {{around the}} same time as when expansion stops and the cake sets or collapses. When starch granules are exposed to heat and water, they swell, leaching out some starch and forming hydrogen bonds with <b>other</b> <b>starch</b> granules. About 96% of the starch granules are gelatinized. Starch granules create very strong and rigid gel networks. The starch gel network is interspersed throughout the structure along with the aggregated protein network. The formation of the starch gel may interfere with expanding bubbles, causing them to burst and air to leave the cake. This would result in s collapsed cake.|$|R

50|$|Pregelatinized starch may {{be added}} to {{increase}} the rate of starch gelatinization. One method of pregelatinization starts by heating a mixture of starch and water until a gel forms. The gel may be placed on a heated roll in a thin layer in order to dry it. Once all the water has been removed, a starch cake is left on the roll. The cake is then scraped off and pulverized to form a powder. When the pregelatinized starch powder is subjected to water, a gel forms. The pregelatinized starch increases water adsorption. This in turn increases the batter viscosity and helps retain the entrapped air while the batter is prepared and as it starts to bake. The gel is not as strong has {{it would be if}} a normal starch was mixed with water and heated. However, the combination of pregelatinized starch and starch in the wheat flour create an acceptable gel together. Typically corn starch is used, however a variety of <b>other</b> <b>starches</b> also work.|$|E
40|$|Development of mating {{preference}} {{is considered to}} be an early event in speciation. In this study, mating preference was achieved by dividing a population of Drosophila melanogaster and rearing one part on a molasses medium and the <b>other</b> on a <b>starch</b> medium. When the isolated populations were mixed, “molasses flies” preferred to mate with other molasses flies and “starch flies” preferred to mate with <b>other</b> <b>starch</b> flies. The mating preference appeared after only one generation and was maintained for at least 37 generations. Antibiotic treatment abolished mating preference, suggesting that the fly microbiota was responsible for the phenomenon. This was confirmed by infection experiments with microbiota obtained from the fly media (before antibiotic treatment) as well as with a mixed culture of Lactobacillus species and a pure culture of Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from starch flies. Analytical data suggest that symbiotic bacteria can influence mating preference by changing the levels of cuticular hydrocarbon sex pheromones. The results are discussed {{within the framework of the}} hologenome theory of evolution...|$|R
40|$|Starch has a heterogeneous, semi-crystalline {{granular}} {{structure and the}} degree of ordered structure can affect its behaviour in foods and bioplastics. A range of methodologies are employed to study starch structure; differential scanning calorimetry, C- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FUR). Despite the appeal of FTIR as a rapid, non-destructive methodology, there is currently no systematically defined quantitative relationship between FTIR spectral features and <b>other</b> <b>starch</b> structural measures. Here, we subject 61 starch samples to structural analysis, and systematically correlate FTIR spectra with <b>other</b> measures of <b>starch</b> structure. A hydration dependent peak position shift in the FTIR spectra of starch is observed, resulting from increased molecular order, but with complex, non-linear behaviour. We demonstrate that FTIR is a tool that can quantitatively probe short range interactions in starch structure. However, the assumptions of linear relationships between starch ordered structure and peak ratios are overly simplistic. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
