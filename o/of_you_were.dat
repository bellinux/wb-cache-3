500|$|Davuluri, {{the first}} Indian American {{to win the}} Miss America pageant (and the second Miss New York in a row), held the title of Miss America 2014 from September 15, 2013 to September 14, 2014. In doing so, she {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} a previous Miss Syracuse/Miss New York, Vanessa Williams, who (as Miss America 1984) was the first African American winner of the pageant. She is also the second Asian American contestant to be crowned Miss America (the first was Filipino American Angela Perez Baraquio in 2001). NPR's Michael Martin commented on this aspect of her win by noting that “there were five Asian-Americans competing for the crown. That's the highest number in pageant history. Three <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in the top five. Two <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> the finalists, and this in a contest where initially the requirements were that contestants be of good health and of the white race." ...|$|E

[...] W. W.

500|$|The {{video is}} similar to the director's cut, but has a few differences. The choreography cut offers lengthier shots of Spears and her dancers, and much of the apocalypse storyline is edited out. The clip's ending is also {{different}} from the original: instead of emerging from the manhole Spears just looks into the camera, apparently still hiding in the underground party and hinting at a darker ending in which the world does end. On April 9, 2011, Spears tweeted that she had seen the final cut of the dance version, and was not sure which one she liked best. Ray Kay tweeted on April 14, 2011, that the original version of the video was better, [...] "but it's fun to watch the choreography too." [...] The video, titled [...] "DANCE Till the World Ends" [...] premiered on April 15, 2011. Leah Collins of Dose commented, [...] "sorry, Team Britney, but if any <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> hoping to pass off Spears’ anemic performance in the original as the result of unfortunate editing, this clip isn’t exactly going to bring anyone back on side." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, {{a number}} of militants began to speak openly of their disdain for Atef, leading Bin Laden to convene a meeting at which he spoke at length about Abu Bakr's loyalty to Muhammad. Comparing Atef to the Prophet's lieutenant, he {{reminded}} those present that Atef [...] "knew of Jihad before most <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> even born", and warned them that he didn't {{want to hear any}} more [...] "negative talk" [...] about Atef.|$|E
2500|$|LDS Church apostle George A. Smith {{responded to}} this issue: [...] " [...] the Lord reveals {{anything}} to men He reveals it in language that accords with their own. If any <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to converse with an angel, and you used strictly grammatical language he would do the same. But if you used two negatives in a sentence the heavenly messenger would use language to correspond with your understanding, and this very objection to the Book of Mormon is an evidence in its favor." ...|$|E

I knew then her life would be a burden to her, that she’d blame me for it, but also that she’d never let up, that she’d hold each one of her days fiercely in her teeth. Her birth took fifteen hours, and it was like we were working against each other, like she was raging for the remainder of darkness that she knew then as light. Womb-light, deeper than a bruise. She fought, and she knows in her muscles how I wanted her born, how I worked and wailed just to get her here...|$|R
