50|$|At {{the time}} of the Spanish conquest, writing was a new import and the use of <b>organic</b> <b>medium</b> such as leaf and bamboo, {{ultimately}} lead to the absence of extant pre-Hispanic accounts of Iloilo today. However, oral history - via oral epics has survived to a small degree, as only a few recordings were made from the last known surviving binukots.The earliest written historical accounts concerning the province relates to Spain’s conquest of the island of Panay by Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi moving his headquarters from the island of Cebu and creating the first Spanish settlement in the island in Ogtong in 1566. In 1581 the encomienda in Ogtong was moved to La Villa Rica de Arevalo, however, because of frequent coastal raids by Moro and Dutch privateers, this was again moved near the mouth of the Irong-irong river founding what is now Iloilo City and constructing Fort San Pedro to defend it in 1616.Irong-Irong appears in the Maragtas legend of the coming of ten Bornean datus (Chieftains) to Panay who bartered gold for the plains and valleys of the island from a local Ati chieftain. One datu, Paiburong by name, was given the territory of Irong-Irong (now Iloilo). For 300 years before the coming of the Spaniards, the islanders live in comparative prosperity and peace under an organized government and such laws as the Codes of Kalantiaw.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} small-size screw expander for the energy conversion of hot spring water are described in this report. Recently, the screw expander has been recognized as an effective machine for low temperature energy conversion, i. e. hot spring water. Usually in the low temperature energy conversion cycle, <b>organic</b> working <b>mediums</b> such as NH 3 or fron are used. With the <b>organic</b> working <b>mediums,</b> the performance tests of screw expander under the same conditions of a practical conversion cycle are very difficult. On the other hand, usually small-size screw expanders may be produced by adapting the massproduced screw compressors. We therefore made compression tests with air using small-size screw expanders. For a small-size screw expander, the compression tests with air are rather easy than the expansion tests with air or <b>organic</b> working <b>mediums.</b> If {{the performance of the}} expansion with <b>organic</b> working <b>mediums</b> could be estimated by the compression tests with air, it might be an effective technique for the design of the low temperature energy conversion cycle using the small-size screw expander. In this paper, we report the experimental results of the compression tests with air, of the expansion tests with air or R II, and comprise the results. The principal specifications of the two testing screw expanders are the built-in volume ratios are 2. 0 and 2. 4, and the exit displacement, 0. 816 m 3 / 1000 rev., which is the same for both expanders...|$|R

40|$|Twisted {{intramolecular}} {{charge transfer}} (TICT) {{is one of}} the hot points in condensed phase photochemistry at the present time.

Changing the concentration of the stabilizing agent could modify this interaction, leading to the preferential growth of certain crystal planes of SnO particles which determined the particle shape. This synthesis approach is advantageous in terms of allowing control over the particle shape as well as for its simplicity and short reaction time.
