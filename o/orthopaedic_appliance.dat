40|$|Abstract AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} Second Class Resolver (SCR), a new fixed <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>appliance,</b> {{for the treatment of}} skeletal Class II malocclusion in growing subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Design Retrospective analysis. Forty subjects were treated with Second Class Resolver (SCR). The mean age was 8 years at the beginning of treatment and 10 years at the end of treatment. Digital cephalometric superimpositions on lateral radiographs taken at start and end of treatment were assessed. The cephalometric values were statistically analysed. RESULTS: Cephalometric analysis of changes during treatment shows reduction of ANB angle (mean 2 °); reduction of Witts Index (mean 3 mm); reduction of Maxillo-Mandibular angle (MM) (mean 1 °); reduction of SNA (angle mean 3 °); reduction of gonial angle (mean 1. 8 °); increase of the mandibular branch length (mean 5 mm); increase of mandibular body (mean 2. 9 °).

40|$|The rapid palatal {{expander}} (RPE) is an <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>appliance</b> that widens {{the upper}} jaw by separating the midpalatal suture. This procedure {{also allows for}} the creation of more space for the eruption of the permanent teeth. The procedure for RPE is still controversial and many different methods have been described since the time of Angell, when he presented the first case of correction of maxillary transverse discrepancy in 1860. A permanent increase in maxillary transverse width is attained routinely in children and adolescents using orthodontic expansion appliances and retention, and this treatment does not normally cause any problem. In this work is presented a preliminary study, based on a reverse engineering measurement approach, to evaluate the palatal morphologic and volumetric changes after the use of a RPE appliance in four children patients (aged 7 - 8 years) in mixed dentition with a posterior crossbite, a skeletal Class II malocclusion and with narrow maxillary arches. The patients were treated using the Haas RPE in order to solve the maxillary contraction.

40|$|Abstract: Spinal cord {{injuries}} (SCIs) have {{a profound}} physical, social and emotional cost to patients and their families. Obviously SCIs severely disrupt normal patterns of interaction with the environment. Firstly, the opportunities for active interaction are inevitably diminished due to motor or sensory impairment. Moreover, such problems may increase as the time since injury lengthens and the patient becomes more withdrawn and isolated in all spheres of activity. However, advances in Information Technology are providing new opportunities for rehabilitation technology. These advances are helping people to overcome the physical limitations affecting their mobility or their ability to hear, see or speak. In this chapter an overview is given of the design issues of a VR-enhanced <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>appliance</b> {{to be used in}} SCI rehabilitation. The basis for this approach is that physical therapy and motivation are crucial for maintaining flexibility and muscle strength and for reorganizing the nervous system after SCIs.

40|$|Summary. The study {{concerns}} 25 patients consecutively {{treated with}} an <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>appliance,</b> {{similar to that}} described by Bass, 1983. All patients had a severe Class II malocclusion. The patients, 14 boys and 11 girls, mean age 10. 9 years, used the appliance uninterruptedly. At night it was combined with a high-pull headgear. Treatment aimed at decreasing skeletal sagittal deviations and improving soft tissue function, with an initial intensive orthopaedic phase (8 — 12 months) followed by a second phase in which edgewise therapy was used to establish optimal occlusion. Lateral cephalometric radiographs, models and photographs from before treatment, after six months {{and at the end}} of treatment, were studied. The orthopaedic treatment was completed after 6 months in 4 patients and after 8 to 15 months in the rest. During the first 6 months the ANB-angle was reduced 1. 7 °, comprising a reduction of the SNA-angle by 0. 3 ° and an increase of the SNB-angle by 1. 4 °. The effect on lower incisors varied greatly: the angle 31, 41 /ML showed a mean increase of 2. 9 °, with a variation from- 2. 5 to + 9. 4. The inclination of the upper incisors was slightly reduced. The mandible rotated slightly anteriorly. The inclination of the palatal plane remained unchanged during treatment. In patients treated for 8 to 15 months the SNA-angle decreased 0. 9 ° and the SNB-angle increased 2. 2 °. The mandible rotated further anteriorly and the inclination of the palatal plane was still unchanged. The conclusion is that with the present appliance, skeletal and soft tissue relations can be successfully improved in severe Class II malocclusions if the patients are growing...|$|E
40|$|Background Apnoea is a {{breathing}} disorder {{marked by the}} absence of airflow at the nose or mouth. in children, risk factors include adenotonsillar hypertrophy, obesity, neuromuscular disorders and craniofacial anomalies. the most common treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) in childhood is adenotonsillectomy. This approach is limited by its surgical risks, mostly in children with comorbities and, in some patients, by recurrence that can be associated with craniofacial problems. Oral <b>appliances</b> and functional <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>appliances</b> have been used for patients who have OSAS and craniofacial anomalies because they change the mandible posture forwards and potentially enlarge the upper airway and increase the upper airspace, improving the respiratory function. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of oral <b>appliances</b> or functional <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>appliances</b> for OSAS in children. Search strategy A sensitive search was developed for the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 3); PubMed (January 1966 to September 2005); EMBASE (1980 to September 2005); Lilacs (1982 to September 2005); BBO-Bibliografia Brasileira de Odontologia (1986 to September 2005); and SciELO (1997 to September 2005). There was no restriction of language or source of information. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing all types of oral and functional <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>appliances</b> with placebo or no treatment, in children 15 years old or younger. Primary outcome: reduction of apnoea to less than one episode per hour. Secondary outcomes: dental and skeletal relationship, sleep parameters improvement, cognitive and phonoaudiologic function, behavioural problems, drop outs and withdrawals, quality of life, side effects (tolerability), economic evaluation. Data collection and analysis Data were independently extracted by two review authors. Authors were contacted for additional information. Risk ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for all important dichotomous outcomes. Main results the initial search identified 384 trials. One of them, reporting results from a total of 23 patients, was suitable for inclusion in the review. Data provided in the published report did not answer all the questions from this review, but some of them were, and the presented results favour treatment. Authors' conclusions At present there is no sufficient evidence to state that oral <b>appliances</b> or functional <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>appliances</b> are effective in the treatment of OSAS in children. Oral <b>appliances</b> or functional <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>appliances</b> may be helpful in the treatment of children with craniofacial anomalies which are risk factors for apnoea.

40|$|Idiopathic {{facial palsy}} {{is the most}} common cause of {{unilateral}} neurologic disorders of the cranial nerves. It can result from congenital, due to delivery traumas, and genetic or malformative diseases, or acquired due to infective, inflammatory, neoplastic, traumatic or iatrogenic causes. In the great majority of cases its causes are unknown. A careful differential diagnosis is recommended in paediatric patients, in order to establish the most appropriate treatment as the therapeutic approach differs in relation to the aetiology. Controversy exists regarding treatment options. The primary concern in the treatment is to restore the aesthetics, function and comfort. Facial palsy may result in a multitude of conditions such as: affected salivation, taste and lachrymation, depending on the topography of the facial nerve affection, and patients may also refer auditory hipersesitivity which may result in noise intolerance. In this paper a case of a child with unilateral facial palsy is described. The patient was treated by <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>appliances</b> and surgical facial reanimation. At the end of therapy good aesthetic and functional results were obtained. Oral functions as well as facial expression were partially recovered and symmetry was almost completely restored.

40|$|BACKGROUND: When {{faced with}} {{developing}} orthopaedic {{services for children}} in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is little objective evidence-based data on the magnitude and type of services needed. Rwanda is a small country {{that is in the}} process of developing orthopaedic and rehabilitation services, and its Ministry of Health supported a survey that would provide information necessary for planning such services. METHODS: A national survey of musculoskeletal impairment (MSI) prevalence was undertaken. Of a population of 8. 4 million, 8368 people were enumerated. Four thousand one hundred thirty-four were aged 16 years or less. Cases who failed a screening test for MSI were examined, allocated a diagnostic category, and assessed as to treatment needed. RESULTS: Of 4134 people aged 16 years or less who were enumerated, 3526 (85 %) were screened and 91 had MSI, giving a prevalence of MSI among children of 2. 58 % (95 % confidence interval; 2. 06 - 3. 10). Twenty-three percent of MSIs were a result of congenital deformity, 14 % neurologic conditions, 12 % trauma, 3 % infection, and 46 % other acquired pathology. Of the MSIs, 56. 7 % were mild, 37. 8 % moderate, and 5. 6 % severe. Extrapolated treatment needs suggest that 2 % of Rwandan children (approximately 80, 000) need orthopaedic physical therapy, 1. 2 % (50, 000) need orthopaedic surgery, and approximately 10, 000 need <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>appliances.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These results will be of use in planning future paediatric orthopaedic services in Rwanda, and for comparative studies in other low-income countries...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{calculate}} {{costs for}} the management of deep foot infections and to identify the most important factors related to treatment costs. Design: Costs for in-hospital care, surgery, investigations, antibacterials, visits to the foot-care team, <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>appliances</b> and topical treatment were calculated retrospectively from diagnosis until healing or death. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify factors that independently affect costs. Setting: A multidisciplinary foot-care team. Patients: 220 prospectively followed patients with diabetes mellitus and deep foot infections who were referred to the team from 1986 to 1995. Main Outcome Measures and Results: Total cost for healing without amputation was Swedish kronor (SEK) 136 600 per patient, while the corresponding cost for healing with minor amputation was SEK 260 000 and with major amputation was SEK 234 500. All costs were quoted in SEK at 1997 price levels (£ 1 sterling and $US 1 equalled approximately SEK 12. 50 and SEK 7. 64, respectively). The cost of antibacterials was 4 % of total costs. The cost of topical treatment was 51 % of total costs and related to wound healing time. Number of weeks between diagnosis of deep foot infection and healing, and number of surgical procedures were variables that explained 95 % of costs in the multiple regression analysis. It was not possible to find any parameters present at diagnosis that could contribute to an explanation of total treatment costs. Conclusions: Topical treatment accounted for the largest proportion of total costs and the most important cost driving factors were wound healing duration and repeated surgery. Costs of antibacterials should not be used as an argument in the choice between early amputation and conservative treatment...|$|R

40|$|Form and {{function}} are inextricably intertwined in orthodontics. Our {{understanding of the}} hard tissue relationship has been comprehensive, with extensive clinical trials both cross sectional and longitudinal {{over the past several}} decades. The majority of studies have used standardized cephalograms that reflect our current concepts. However, the same cannot be stated for soft tissues and, more specifically, the muscles that envelope the skeletal bases. The aim of the current study was to objectively evaluate the masseter muscle – one of the key elevator muscles in the human masticatory system with innovative diagnostic tools like electromyography (EMG), ultrasonography (US) and 3 -D imaging (Mona Lisa®). Standard lateral cephalometrics were used as the gold standard for measuring the vertical facial dimensions and correlating the findings to the above mentioned modalities. This extensive study comprised three major components and involved subjects from the same cohort. Firstly, the masseter muscle spindle reflexes were studied in dynamic chewing and the responses recorded with EMG in 28 human subjects. These were then analysed and correlated to the vertical facial proportion from standardized lateral cephalograms. Although substantial work has been done to evaluate the various trigeminal reflexes¹⁻³, limited research has investigated the reflexes from the muscle spindles in different facial proportions⁴. This is primarily due to the inherent complexity of the neurophysiology compounded by noise within the experimental models. Most often the method used to elicit a muscle spindle reflex in the human jaw involves a brief mechanical depression of the mandible, either by use of a tendon hammer or, if a more controlled stimulus is required, a computer-controlled stretching device⁵⁻⁷. In the current study, a sophisticated apparatus was utilized to deliver precise profile stimulus at predetermined intervals. Significant correlations were observed between the muscle spindle response and selected vertical proportions. The second phase of study was to utilize US for measuring masseter muscle dimensions in the same cohort and once again correlate the various dimensions of the masseter muscle to the facial proportions generated by the lateral cephalometrics. US has been studied in dentistry for over four decades and it has been established as a safe, non-invasive, comfortable and cost-effective diagnostic implement. Also, US produces high resolution images of soft tissues more readily than MRI and CT scans⁸. Among the limitations for US there is the concern about reproducibility and standardization particularly between operators. Hence, it is advisable to have a single operator for data collection in order to preclude interexaminer variability. Future use of US in dentistry will be favoured especially where periodic evaluation is needed and there are concerns about radiation. Finally, for a more holistic assessment, 3 D optical scanning was used in the same sample cohort to analyse and correlate masseter muscle dimensions to vertical and transverse facial proportions. Regression equations were generated, albeit from the convenience sample, to explore a mathematical model for deriving variables of interest rather than physically conducting the individual measurements, particularly if that required radiation. Current work shows strong correlations between lateral cephalometric and 3 D imaging variables, but relatively weak associations with the ultrasonography. The findings from this study support the use of predictive equations from 3 D imaging for lateral cephalometric variables but larger scale studies are required to confirm reproducibility. Moreover, curvilinear measurements from 3 D images were significantly different (p < 0. 0001) to the linear and should be adopted for more meaningful representation of the soft tissues. These findings are relevant to facial form {{and function}} assessment which is used in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning; in particular, orthodontic functional appliance therapy. Analyses of the face can be carried out with a myriad of cephalometric packages; however, the role of the elevator muscles is often overlooked and their contribution to changes and/or characteristics that could benefit the orthodontic treatment is not fully appreciated. Thus, the assessment not only of anatomical but also physiological variations in the masseter muscles is important in the management of different facial patterns. The above tools provide a means to evaluate muscle functions which would be of particular interest in growing children and where functional <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>appliances</b> utilize forces from the muscles of mastication. Furthermore, periodic evaluation of such cases is generally desirable and needs to be safe, radiation free and cost-effective. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Transition metals such as nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), {{palladium}} (Pd), chromium (Cr) {{and gold}} (Au) {{are widely used}} as alloys in jewelry and biomaterials such as orthodontic and <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>appliances.</b> These metals also cause cell-mediated allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) reactions in {{a significant proportion of}} the population upon prolonged direct exposure. The immune mechanisms underlying the response to these metals are not yet well defined. In the studies described in this thesis we therefore investigated the profile of cytokine responses to various metal ions in vitro and the relationship with the ACD reaction in vivo. In the first study, we investigated the relationship between the profile and magnitude of Ni 2 +-induced cytokine responses in vitro and the degree of in vivo reactivity to Ni 2 +. PBMC from Ni 2 +-reactive (ACD) and non-reactive control subjects were cultured with or without NiCl 2. The numbers of IL- 4 -, IL- 5 - and IL- 13 -producing cells and the concentrations of IFN-γ, IL- 10 and IL- 13 produced were analysed by ELISpot and ELISA respectively. Ni 2 + elicited a mixed Th 1 - and Th 2 -type cytokine profile in PBMC from ACD subjects with a positive correlation observed between the levels of the elicited cytokines and the degree of patch test reactivity. Hence, suggesting an involvement of both Th 1 - and Th 2 -type cytokines in ACD to Ni 2 + and a direct association between the magnitude of the Ni 2 +-induced cytokine response overall and the in vivo reactivity to Ni 2 +. The impact of the regulatory cytokine IL- 10 on Ni 2 +-induced Th 1 - and Th 2 -type cytokine responses in human PBMC was investigated in the next study. PBMC from blood donors with a history of Ni 2 + reactivity and non-reactive control donors were stimulated with Ni 2 + ex vivo with or without addition of human recombinant IL- 10 (rIL- 10) or neutralising mAb to IL- 10. Depletion/enrichment experiments were performed to phenotype the Ni 2 +-specific cytokine producing cells. Exogenous rIL- 10 significantly down-regulated the production of all cytokines but with a more pronounced effect on IFN-γ. IL- 10 neutralisation, on the other hand, enhanced the levels of Ni 2 +-induced IFN-γ only. Ni 2 +-specific cytokine-producing cells in PBMC were found to be predominantly CD 4 + T cells. Thus, IL- 10 may play a regulatory role in vivo by counteracting the ACD reactions mediated by CD 4 + T cells producing Th 1 -type cytokines. In the third study, we investigated the relationship between in vivo patch test reactivity to a number of metals (Ni, Co, Pd, Cr and Au) included in the standard and/or dental patch test series and in vitro responses to the metals in question. PBMC from metal patch test positive and negative control subjects were stimulated with a panel of eight metal salts and cytokine responses analysed by ELISpot and/or ELISA. A mixed Th 1 - (IL- 2 and/or IFN-γ) and Th 2 -type (IL- 4 and/or IL- 13) cytokine profile was observed in PBMC from most metal allergic subjects upon in vitro stimulation with the metal(s) to which the subject was patch test positive. Our data suggest that other metals included in the standard and dental patch test series, just like Ni 2 +, induce a mixed Th 1 - and Th 2 -type cytokine profile in PBMC from ACD subjects in vitro. We further developed a simplified ELISpot protocol utilising plates precoated with capture monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and subsequent detection in one step using enzyme-labelled mAb, for enumerating the frequency of allergen (Ni 2 +) -specific cytokine producing cells. This was compared with a regular ELISpot protocol, with an overnight incubation for capture mAb adsorbtion and detection with biotinylated mAb followed by enzyme-labelled streptavidin. PBMC from Ni 2 +-reactive and non-reactive subjects were incubated with or without NiCl 2 and the enumeration of cells producing IFN-γ, IL- 4 or IL- 13 by the two protocols were compared. PBMC from Ni 2 +-reactive subjects showed significantly higher Ni 2 +-induced IL- 4 and IL- 13 responses and the number of antigen-specific cytokine-producing cells determined by the two ELISpot protocols correlated well. In a nutshell, our data point to the potential use of in vitro cytokine assays as diagnostic tools in distinguishing ACD subjects sensitised to different metals and non-sensitised subjects...|$|R
