5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} a significant decline in ratings and plans {{were made to}} take the series into a 'back to basics' approach where storylines would become less controversial {{and return to the}} focus <b>on</b> <b>relationships</b> and family dynamics.

5|$|As {{they travel}} together, Natalie {{questions}} Ryan's philosophies on life, particularly <b>on</b> <b>relationships</b> and love, but Ryan is adamant {{that he is}} more than happy with his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message, and Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. Natalie later lectures Ryan about his refusal to consider a commitment to Alex {{in spite of their}} obvious compatibility, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterward they are both ordered back to Omaha to implement Natalie's program. On the test run, the earlier concerns Ryan raised prove valid; one laid-off person breaks down in tears before the camera, and Natalie is unable to comfort him.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} used three adult {{attachment}} styles: secure, avoidant and anxious/resistant (Hazan and Shaver 1987) and six lovestyles: Eros, Ludus, Storge, Mania, Pragma and Agape (Lee 1973) to predict sexual and relationship satisfaction. The sample of 111 (64 women, 46 men, 1 sex unstated) were either currently or {{recently in a}} relationship of three months or more. Regressions to test a mediational model of sexual satisfaction <b>on</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction showed that the Eros lovestyle had a direct positive effect <b>on</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction and an indirect positive effect on relational satisfaction via sexual satisfaction, while Ludus and avoidant attachment both exhibited direct negative effects <b>on</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction, and indirect negative effects <b>on</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction via sexual satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|In South Africa, small tourism {{enterprises}} lie at {{the heart}} of the industry and form a major part of the tourism sector. There are the cornerstones of tourism development in local economies. This study assessed the influence of <b>relationship</b> proneness <b>on</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction and relationship commitment among domestic tourism clients within the Cape Town Metropolitan Area of South Africa. In spite of the increasing research on small tourism enterprises, they seem to be a paucity of studies that have investigated the influence of <b>relationship</b> proneness <b>on</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction and relationship commitment. The study utilised a quantitative research design using a structured questionnaire. The design was suitable to solicit the required information relating to relationship proneness, relationship satisfaction and relationship commitment. The findings indicate that relationship proneness has a positive influence <b>on</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction, relationship proneness has a positive influence <b>on</b> <b>relationship</b> commitment and relationship satisfaction exerts a positive influence <b>on</b> <b>relationship</b> commitment. All the posited three hypotheses were supported. The empirical study provided fruitful implications to academicians by making a significant contribution to the relationship marketing literature by systematically exploring the influence of <b>relationship</b> proneness <b>on</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction and relationship commitment. This study therefore, stand to immensely contribute new knowledge to the existing body of relationship marketing literature in Africa – a context that is often most neglected by some researchers in developing countries...|$|R

25|$|The main sex {{education}} programme in Scotland is Healthy Respect, which focuses {{not only on}} the biological aspects of reproduction but also <b>on</b> <b>relationships</b> and emotions. Education about contraception and sexually transmitted diseases are included in the programme as a way of encouraging good sexual health. In response to a refusal by Catholic schools to commit to the programme, however, a separate {{sex education}} programme has been developed for use in those schools. Funded by the Scottish Government, the programme Called to Love focuses on encouraging children to delay sex until marriage, and does not cover contraception, and as such is a form of abstinence-only sex education.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to disaggregate the {{relationship}} commitment construct into organizational motives component and relationship continuity component and investigate {{the effects of}} the motives <b>on</b> <b>relationship</b> continuity. These motives were based on the three-component conceptualization of organizational commitment, which included affective, structural, and normative motives. Constructs associated with affective motives were relationship value and trustworthiness, whereas constructs related to structural motives were switching costs and comparison level of the alternatives. Corporate cultural similarity was proposed to be the key construct associated with normative motives. The results showed that all five constructs associated with the three groups of motives had significant effects <b>on</b> <b>relationship</b> continuity. Trustworthiness was found to have the strongest effect <b>on</b> <b>relationship</b> continuity, followed by relationship value, switching costs, comparison level of the alternatives, and corporate cultural similarity. In addition, corporate cultural similarity was found to moderate the effect of switching costs <b>on</b> <b>relationship</b> continuity...|$|R

25|$|These {{differences}} {{in teaching and}} style of worship have become more marked {{in recent years as}} those leading the Diocese of Sydney allege that other dioceses have become theologically liberal. This has placed continued strain <b>on</b> <b>relationships</b> with those other dioceses. As a consequence of this some parishes outside the Sydney diocese are reluctant to invite Sydney-trained clergy to ministry positions and, conversely, clergy trained outside Sydney are rarely invited to minister within the Sydney diocese. However, many of the large and growing Evangelical churches in dioceses such as Adelaide and Perth continue to recruit some clergy and lay staff trained at Moore College.|$|E
