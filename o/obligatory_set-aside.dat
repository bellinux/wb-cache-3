These are mainly introduced as part of both obligatory and voluntary set-aside schemes. However, the <b>obligatory</b> <b>set-aside</b> has recently been abolished by the Common Agricultural Policy Health Check. In this study, we examine the role of fallow in fine-grained habitat use by a threatened farmland bird (Lesser Kestrel) during summer in northwestern Spain. To analyze Lesser Kestrel occurrence, we used generalized linear models, a theoretic-information approach and a hierarchical partitioning analysis. The best AIC-based models explaining occurrence of Lesser Kestrels showed that fallow was the more important habitat type followed, to a lesser extent, by dry cereal stubble and field margin. In contrast, irrigated crops negatively influenced occurrence. Heterogeneity of crop mosaic was not important in explaining occurrence of Lesser Kestrel. Fallows, like dry cereal stubbles and field margins, seem to be suitable for foraging given the abundance of high food resources and their availability due to shorter vegetation cover. The abolition of the <b>obligatory</b> <b>set-aside</b> could reduce the total surface of fallow land (approximately 40. 9 %), likely affecting habitat use by Lesser Kestrel through an increase of other non-preferred crops (e. g., irrigated crops) or by decreasing food resources. Agri-environment schemes focusing on the {{maintenance of}} low-intensive farming systems with a mosaic of crops and semi-natural habitats interspersed should be promoted in premigratory areas to maintain Lesser Kestrel...|$|E
40|$|Besides {{the known}} {{environmental}} benefits, {{national and regional}} economic impacts may form additional arguments for stimulating government measures in favour of electricity production from energy crops in the Netherlands. Therefore, we compared the economic impacts (at both national and regional level) of heat and power generation from energy crops (willow) and from imported natural gas in the Netherlands. Both conversion systems used combined cycle technology (30 MW electric and 30 MW thermal capacity). Input-Output Analysis was used to calculate indirect impacts. It is concluded that, for the case under consideration, generating electricity from willow, compared to using natural gas, gives a higher contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (both nationally and regionally) and creates more employment if willow is produced at <b>obligatory</b> <b>set-aside</b> agricultural areas (in the chosen region in the Netherlands). However, when grain production is substituted by willow, the renewable system results in smaller effects on the economy than the fossil alternative...|$|E
40|$|The article {{describes}} the evolution and future of the set-aside system of the European Union. The focus is on Finland s integration to the system. The future developments are evaluated from Finland s point of view. To {{be eligible for the}} compensatory payments introduced as part of the CAP reform for arable crops, producers must set aside a portion of their arable land with a view to achieving a better balance between production and domestic and international demand. The set-aside rate was fixed at 15 % for the rotational set-aside and 20 % (18 % in the UK and Denmark) for other forms of set-aside. The set-aside requirements do not appeal small producers producing less than 92 tons cereals a year. Because of bad harvests in certain areas of the world combined with effective production control measures, for the marketing year 1995 / 96, the set-aside rate was cut to 12 % (15 % and 17 %). During the year 1995, the intervention stocks of cereals continuously decreased and world market prices increased. Consequently, the EU decided to cut the set-aside rate to 10 % for the 1996 / 97 marketing year. As usual, the reduction only applies for the 1996 / 97 marketing year. For the year 1997 / 98, the portion will automatically revert to 15 % (and 18 % and 20 %). The cut of set-aside rate serve the interest of major cereals- producing countries. Finland is obliged to pay her share of the costs without getting any advantage. Finland s interest would probably be to increase the set-aside rate. This is because, within a certain range, (a) the change of the <b>obligatory</b> <b>set-aside</b> rate barely affects the set-aside area in Finland; (b) the change of the <b>obligatory</b> <b>set-aside</b> rate barely affects the cereals production in Finland; and (c) the change of the cereals-production area barely affects the farm income in Finland. The discussion concerning the future development of the EU set-aside system should include the following themes: (a) is the current cereals shortage a temporal or continuous phenomenon; (b) as a high set-aside rate helps to keep cereal prices up, farmers would gain in the form of high producer prices and the tax payers would gain in the form of low export subsidies (or high export taxes); (c) because the increase of set-aside rate is more difficult than the cut, the cuts should be postpo ned if possible; (b) an alternative way to increase production is to rise the farm-by-farm ceiling of 92 tons (that makes the set-aside obligatory), rather than to cut the set-aside rate; and (e) for environmental reasons, the set-aside area shou ld be covered with plants. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL) The temporal cut of the EU set-aside requirements for the 1996 / 97 marketing year: consequences for Finlan...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{constitution}} {{and quality of}} the German agricultural landscapes and their effects on the population trends of common breeding-bird species are summarised and interpreted. Out of the 112 most common species, 30 species are considered as typical farmland birds. The majority of these farmland birds showed declining trends. A distinct recovery of a part of the species after the German reunification in the early 1990 s, in East Germany in particular, was followed by a decline of most species since c. 1996. In the latest period (after 2007) the declines seem to accelerate. Population decreases are stronger in West Germany compared to East Germany. Periods with a high proportion of set-asides (fallows) and organic farming (1993 - 1995, 2002 - 2005) were favourable for the population development of many farmland bird species whilst a high proportion of maize crops had a negative effect. The strong increase of maize crops for biofuel production after 2005 (caused by the new German Renewable Energies Act) and the abolition of the <b>obligatory</b> EU <b>set-asides</b> since 2007 led to declines in the majority of farmland species, also of species that benefited from the set-asides over a long period. According to the summarised data, 10 % of set-asides on agricultural land are necessary to halt the decline of farmland birds (currently < 1 %), or in total twice as large set-aside and organic farming area in relation to maize crops (current ratio set-aside to maize is 1 : 20 !). A share of 33 % of organic farming plus 15 % extensive grassland use in an area of 1, 300 km² is suffi cient to improve the farmland bird trends substantially (Schorfheide-Chorin Biosphere Reserve). In a region with more than 95 % of organic farming within the Schorfheide-Chorin Biosphere Reserve more farmland birds were increasing than declining...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{present the}} {{beginnings}} of a planning support system (PSS) for agri-environmental measures exemplified by a virtual implementation of Colorfields and blooming strips on model farms, based on real-world data. This paper starts with an introduction to the Colorfields, a concept for transdisciplinary and sustainable landscape design of set-aside land. Colorfields comprise of blooming strips of flowering annual or biennial plants, which are designed and drilled in pattern on fallow land creating Land Art. The temporary scenic arrangements of the Colorfields combine the advantages of ecological strips, e. g. providing habitats for insects (especially bees), improving soil fertility through the cultivation of intercrops, with improvements of the social recognition of farmers as producers of pleasant landscapes instead of monoculture fields. The prototype of the PSS uses two software tools of different scientific origin, the bio-economic modeling system MODAM and the landscape visualization system Lenné 3 D, which are linked based on geo-data. The resulting system helps to assess the economic effects and visualizes the effects of the specific landuse patterns under different scenarios. The economic assessment of blooming strips on arable land and of one Colorfield on fallow land shows that these measures prove to be profitable from an economic viewpoint assuming the current area payments for the <b>obligatory</b> European Union <b>set-aside</b> program. Furthermore, the visualizations enable the design to be tested virtually by exploring the resultant scenery. They provide artists, planners and stakeholders including farmers with a tool to virtually wander through landscape scenarios supporting a collaborative design and a shared vision for the community. The results of the two model farms and previous case studies for Colorfields demonstrate how current policy conditions could be used for the improvement of environmental and scenic qualities. Furthermore, the ability of the tools, MODAM and Lenné 3 D, suggests to support and promote these activities...|$|R
