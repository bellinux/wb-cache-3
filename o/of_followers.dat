40|$|This {{research}} {{is intended to}} analyze the influence of leader behavior on follower belief in transformational leadership based on syncretical model of charismatic/transformational leadership. There are three problems to discuss on this research: (i) What the displays empathy and dramatizes the mission of leader behavior has influence on the inspiration <b>of</b> <b>follower?,</b> (ii) What the projects self-assurence and enhances the leader 2 ̆ 7 s image of leader behavior has influence on the awe <b>of</b> <b>follower?,</b> (iii) What the assures <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> their competency and provides followers with opportunities to experience success of leader behavior has influence on the empowerment of follower?The number of the respondent is 119 graduate students of Magister Management Program taken from three (3) state and private universities in Jogjakarta. The questionnaire developed by Behling and McFillen (1996) was used to collect the data. Eighteen (18) items are {{used to measure the}} variable of leader behavior and fifteen (15) items are used to measure the variable <b>of</b> <b>follower</b> belief. The data were analized by Multiple Regression Analysis. The result of this study indicate that: (i) the displays empathy of leader behavior has a positive and significant influence on the inspiration <b>of</b> <b>follower,</b> while dramatizes the mission of leader behavior has no influence on the inspiration <b>of</b> <b>follower,</b> (ii) projects self-assurence and enhances the leader 2 ̆ 7 s image of leader behavior has a positive and significant influence on the awe <b>of</b> <b>follower,</b> (iii) assures <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> their competency and provides followers with opportunities to experience success of leader behavior has a positive and significant influence on the empowerment <b>of</b> <b>follower...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article reviews {{empirical}} {{research on the}} role <b>of</b> <b>follower</b> self-conception in leadership effectiveness, and specifies an agenda for future research in this area. The review shows that several aspects <b>of</b> <b>follower</b> self-conception (i. e., self-construal, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and self-consistency) may be affected by leadership, and may mediate the effects <b>of</b> leadership on <b>follower</b> behavior. There also is consistent evidence that follower self-construal moderates the impact <b>of</b> leadership on <b>follower</b> attitudes and behavior. Two key themes for future research are defined. First, future research {{should focus on the}} development of theory about the role of relational self-construal in the leadership process. Second, it seems particularly valuable to develop theory about the interplay of different aspects <b>of</b> <b>follower</b> self-conception in leadership effectiveness, including the interactive effects of these aspects of self. Working backwards from these theoretical models <b>of</b> <b>follower</b> self-conception, specific leader behavior relevant to these aspects of self should then be identified. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of Antoinists: desservants who perform worship, people who wear the religious clothing, regular faithful who attend the service every week, and occasional members or visitors. As its {{aim is to}} heal and comfort through faith, Antoinism does not seek to convert new people. The number <b>of</b> <b>followers</b> is difficult to assess as there are no statistics established by the religion. After a period of rapid growth in Belgium, the number <b>of</b> <b>followers</b> is currently on {{the decline in the}} country and some temples were forced to close due to lack of money or faithful; for example, in 2003, Human Rights Without Frontiers counted less than 150 worshipers in the country. In France, however, the religion remains active and counts about 2,500 regular members. Estimates of the worldwide membership vary from few thousand to 200,000. The future growth of the number <b>of</b> <b>followers,</b> however, can be affected by certain rules of the group. As it does not practice proselytism, Antoinism suffers from a lack of social visibility and many people are unaware even of Antoinist temples in their neighborhood. Moreover, because of the availability required for worship and the absence of income in the religion, dressed members and desservants are often old-age retired people.|$|E

40|$|Neural {{development}} in metazoans {{is characterized by}} the establishment of initial process tracts by pioneer axons and the subsequent extension <b>of</b> <b>follower</b> axons along these pioneer processes. Mechanisms governing the fidelity <b>of</b> <b>follower</b> extension along pioneered routes are largely unknown. In C. elegans, formation of the right angle-shaped lumbar commissure connecting the lumbar and preanal ganglia is an example of pioneer/follower dynamics. We find that the dystroglycan ortholog DGN- 1 mediates the fidelity <b>of</b> <b>follower</b> lumbar commissure axon extension along the pioneer axon route. In dgn- 1 mutants, the axon of the pioneer PVQ neuron faithfully establishes the lumbar commissure, but axons <b>of</b> <b>follower</b> lumbar neurons, such as PVC, frequently bypass the lumbar commissure and extend along an oblique trajectory directly toward the preanal ganglion. In contrast, disruption of the UNC- 6 /netrin guidance pathway principally perturbs PVQ ventral guidance to pioneer the lumbar commissure. Loss of DGN- 1 in unc- 6 mutants has a quantitatively similar effect on follower axon guidance regardless of PVQ axon route, indicating that DGN- 1 does not mediate follower/pioneer adhesion. Instead, DGN- 1 appears to block premature responsiveness <b>of</b> <b>follower</b> axons to a preanal ganglion-directed guidance cue, which mediates ventral-to-anterior reorientation of lumbar commissure axons. Deletion analysis shows that only the most N-terminal DGN- 1 domain is required for these activities. These studies suggest that dystroglycan modulation of growth cone responsiveness to conflicting guidance cues is important for restricting follower axon extension to the tracts laid down by pioneers...|$|R

His recognition has always been greater outside the official church, its calendar and liturgy. Historians credit this to his zealous personality, his criticism of the church hierarchy, his emphasis on direct experience of God, and some of his unorthodox teachings—including his belief that an unordained monk who had the direct experience of God was empowered to absolve others of their sins.|$|E
