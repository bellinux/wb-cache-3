5|$|Both {{the sale}} of weapons to Iran, and the funding of the Contras, {{attempted}} to circumvent not only stated administration policy, but also the Boland Amendment. Administration officials argued that regardless of the Congress restricting the funds for the Contras, or any affair, the President (<b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> the administration) could carry on by seeking alternative means of funding such as private entities and foreign governments. Funding from one foreign country, Brunei, was botched when North's secretary, Fawn Hall, transposed the numbers of North's Swiss bank account number. A Swiss businessman, suddenly $10 million richer, alerted the authorities of the mistake. The money was eventually returned to the Sultan of Brunei, with interest.|$|E

25|$|Using {{standard}} IC {{packaging and}} test facilities (called subcons in the IC industry) gives MEMS oscillators production scalability. These facilities {{are capable of}} large production volumes, often {{hundreds of millions of}} ICs per day. This capacity is shared across many IC companies, so ramping production volumes of specific ICs, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> specific MEMS oscillators, is a function of allocating standard production equipment. Conversely, quartz oscillator factories are single-function in nature, so that ramping production requires installing custom equipment, which is more costly and time consuming than allocating standard equipment.|$|E
25|$|The SSRIs are {{the first}} rationally {{designed}} class of psychotropic medications. The strategy behind rational drug design {{is to develop a}} new drug that is capable of affecting a specific biological target, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> a special neural site of action (uptake pumps, receptors), while trying to avoid effects on other site of actions. The goal in such development is to produce pharmacological agents that are more efficacious, safer and better tolerated than older medications. An initial success was achieved when medicinal chemists set out in search of the ideal SSRI with the chemical synthesis of zimelidine (figure 1) from the antihistamine drug brompheniramine, which exhibited selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake with minimal inhibition of norepinephrine (NE) re-uptake. Most importantly, zimelidine did not come with the adverse effect profile as the TCAs and therefore it became the template for the second generation SSRIs. Zimelidine was the first SSRI to be marketed, but several cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome were {{associated with the use of}} the drug which led to withdrawal from the market in 1983. Subsequently, several non-tricyclic SSRIs were discovered and marketed. Fluoxetine, which was FDA approved in 1987 and is usually thought to be the first SSRI to be marketed, paved the way for the next generation of SSRIs and was thought to be some kind of prototype. Introduction of fluoxetine to the market is hailed as a miracle drug for the treatment of depression because it had fewer adverse effects, simpler dosing strategies and greater margin of safety when overdoses were consumed and thus it had better adherence, compared to the older antidepressants (TCAs and MAOIs). Since then the number of drugs in the SSRI class has become bigger and they are now six (fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluvoxamine), as demonstrated in table 1.|$|E

500|$|Speaking in a 2003 {{television}} documentary about Nigel Kneale's career, {{the writer and}} critic Kim Newman praised the underlying themes of Quatermass II, and their particular relevance to the British way of life. [...] "Quatermass II is the British Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing... What Quatermass II does is take that metaphor {{and apply it to}} the specific conditions of Britain in the 1950s; not just the Cold War paranoia, but the traditional British grumbling resentment of bureaucracy as represented by the council, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> big business." [...] The British Film Institute's [...] "Screenonline" [...] website also offers praise in its analysis of the serial."With its tale of an invasion by an invisible enemy indistinguishable from ourselves, Kneale's story tapped into contemporary fears about the 'red' (i.e. communist) threat, although in a less direct way than the American science fiction films of the 1950s, including Invasion of the Body Snatchers. At the same time, it reflected the widespread anxiety of the nuclear age — the story begins with a failed test of a nuclear-powered rocket in Australia (at a time when the country was in reality a site for a series of British nuclear weapons tests). In short, Quatermass II was the perfect cold-war drama." ...|$|E

500|$|The third {{reference}} to the Styx is in Christopher Morley's The Trojan Horse. A return to the romantic comedy of Chaucer is the solution that Boitani sees {{to the problem of}} how the love story can survive Shakespeare's handling of it. Morley gives us such a treatment in a book that revels in its anachronism. Young Lieutenant (soon to be Captain) Troilus lives his life in 1185 BC where he has carefully timetabled everything from praying, to fighting, to examining his own mistakes. He falls for Cressida after seeing her, as ever, in the Temple of Athena where she wears black, as if mourning the defection of her father, the economist Dr Calchas. The flow of the plot follows the traditional story, but the ending is changed once again. Troilus' discovery of Cressida's change of heart happens just before Troy falls. (Morley uses Boccaccio's version of the story of a brooch, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> a pin, attached to a piece of Diomedes' armour as the evidence that convinces the Trojan.) Troilus kills Diomedes as he exits the Trojan Horse, stabbing him in the throat where the captured piece of armour should have been. Then Achilles kills Troilus. The book ends with an epilogue. The Trojan and Greek officers exercise together by the River Styx, all enmities forgotten. A new arrival (Cressida) sees Troilus and Diomedes and wonders why they seem familiar to her. What Boitani calls [...] "a rather dull, if pleasant, ataraxic eternity" [...] replaces Chaucer's Christian version of the afterlife.|$|E
500|$|Songwriter Stephen Schwartz had {{originally}} been slated to write both the music and lyrics for Mulan until he ultimately left the project to write songs for rival studio DreamWorks' animated film The Prince of Egypt (1998) instead after Disney executives forced him {{to choose between the}} two. Schwartz had completed only two songs for Mulan before his resignation, one of which was entitled [...] "China Doll" [...] which, according to Schwartz, [...] "more or less corresponds to the scene in the film in which Mulan goes to the Matchmaker". Schwartz was eventually replaced with composer Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel, who wrote [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] with which to replace Schwartz's [...] "China Doll". Disney cast American singer and actress Marni Nixon, one of Hollywood's most prolific playback singers, as the singing voice of Grandmother Fa, Mulan's paternal grandmother. Nixon received the sheet music for [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] to review prior to auditioning for the role. The filmmakers then showed Nixon a drawing of the character, by whose comedic appearance the singer was immediately [...] "enchanted", telling herself [...] "you've just got to give her a voice... <b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> an unvoice." [...] Improvising her performance, Nixon decided to make the character sound as though she was merely attempting to sing as opposed to actually singing, keeping in mind that the elderly character is toothless. Nixon also made no effort to sound like the actress who had been cast as Grandmother Fa's speaking voice at the time, determining that the two performers sound nothing alike upon listening to the actress' recording. Nixon had almost reconsidered auditioning for the role upon realizing how different she sounded from Grandmother Fa's speaking voice actress.|$|E

An ironic comment {{on the dangers of}} genetic engineering, it was developed with the city specifically in mind as both the banana and lamb were once a common cargo in Liverpool's bustling docks. The thinking behind Chiezo's Superlambanana was the creation of something that 'spoke of the future of 90's Liverpool'. He had previously visited the city and been inspired by the Queensway Tunnel's ventilation shaft, in particular the symbolism of how a vital piece of 1930's engineering had been incorporated into a broader 'sculpture' (<b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> an aesthetically attractive building).
