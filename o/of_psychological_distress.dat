25|$|Longitudinal {{studies have}} {{suggested}} adverse working conditions {{can contribute to the}} development <b>of</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>distress.</b> Psychological distress refers to negative affect, without the individuals necessarily meeting criteria for a psychiatric disorder. Psychological distress is often expressed in affective (depressive), psychophysical or psychosomatic (e.g., headaches, stomach aches, etc.), and anxiety symptoms. The relation of adverse working conditions to psychological distress is thus an important avenue of research. Job satisfaction is also related to negative health outcomes.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{gender differences}} in how emotional and behavioural problems (hyperactivity, emotional problems, and conduct problems) and maternal <b>psychological</b> <b>distress,</b> all measured at three time points in childhood (ages 5, 10, and 16), predict <b>psychological</b> <b>distress</b> in adult life (age 30). METHODS: Longitudinal data from 10, 444 cohort members of the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS 70) were used. RESULTS: Emotional problems in adolescence {{tended to be more}} strongly associated with adult <b>psychological</b> <b>distress</b> in men than in women. No {{gender differences in}} the association <b>of</b> adult <b>psychological</b> <b>distress</b> with maternal <b>psychological</b> <b>distress</b> in adolescence were found. In childhood and adolescence boys' externalizing behaviour problems tended to show more homotypic continuity than girls', but all heterotypic continuity (although very little) of behaviour problems was seen in girls. Maternal <b>psychological</b> <b>distress</b> in childhood tended to have a stronger effect on girls' than boys' emotional problems in adolescence. CONCLUSIONS: In general there was little evidence for gender differences either in the association <b>of</b> adult <b>psychological</b> <b>distress</b> with adolescent psychopathology or in the association <b>of</b> adult <b>psychological</b> <b>distress</b> with maternal <b>psychological</b> <b>distress</b> in adolescence. The continuity of emotional problems from childhood to adolescence to adult life was strong and similar for both sexes...|$|R

25|$|Assessment of {{psychological}} processes related to tinnitus involves measurement of tinnitus severity and distress (i.e. {{nature and extent}} of tinnitus-related problems), measured subjectively by validated self-report tinnitus questionnaires. These questionnaires measure the degree <b>of</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>distress</b> and handicap associated with tinnitus, including effects on hearing, lifestyle, health and emotional functioning. A broader assessment of general functioning, such as levels of anxiety, depression, stress, life stressors and sleep difficulties, is also important in the assessment of tinnitus due to higher risk of negative well-being across these areas, which may be affected by and/or exacerbate the tinnitus symptoms for the individual. Overall, current assessment measures are aimed to identify individual levels of distress and interference, coping responses and perceptions of tinnitus in order to inform treatment and monitor progress. However, wide variability, inconsistencies and lack of consensus regarding assessment methodology are evidenced in the literature, limiting comparison of treatment effectiveness. Developed to guide diagnosis or classify severity, most tinnitus questionnaires have also been shown to be treatment-sensitive outcome measures.|$|E

A prospective controlled study was carried out on 215 healthy adults attending a by-invitation coronary heart disease screening clinic in general practice. The general health questionnaire {{was used as an}} indicator <b>of</b> recent <b>psychological</b> <b>distress.</b> Patients attending the screening clinic had significantly lower subjective <b>psychological</b> <b>distress</b> than an unscreened group of 225 age-matched controls, indicating that we may well be screening an already psychologically healthy sub-group. The main finding was that patients' own assessment <b>of</b> their <b>psychological</b> <b>distress</b> was significantly increased three months after screening compared with that of controls, who showed a non-significant decrease. It is concluded that there is a real risk of causing distress by screening healthy adults and that this possibility has largely been ignored by previous studies.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Dyspepsia is {{prevalent}} in about 30 % {{of the general}} population in Europe, but only 25 % of people with complaints consult their general practitioner.  AIMS—To study the relation between the severity of dyspeptic complaints and the health status of patients presenting to the general practitioner; and the relation with patient characteristics, Helicobacter pylori infection, and <b>psychological</b> <b>distress.</b>  METHODS—A cross sectional, general practice based survey of 360  unselected primary care dyspeptic patients from 92  general practices in The Netherlands was conducted. Symptom severity was measured using a validated symptom score, H pylori using a whole blood test, and <b>psychological</b> <b>distress</b> using the GHQ- 12 test. Functional health status was assessed using the COOP/Wonca charts.  RESULTS—Symptoms lasting more than three months and presence <b>of</b> relevant <b>psychological</b> <b>distress</b> were both associated with higher levels of dyspepsia. H pylori infection, frequency of symptoms, and age had no influence on dyspepsia severity. Severity <b>of</b> dyspepsia and <b>psychological</b> <b>distress,</b> but not H pylori infection or duration of symptoms, affected health status univariately. Dyspepsia correlated with general health, daily activities, and social activities. In logistic modelling, health status was far better predicted by <b>psychological</b> <b>distress</b> than by dyspepsia severity.  CONCLUSION—The relation between dyspeptic symptom severity and health status is limited. H pylori infection relates neither to functional health status, nor to intensity <b>of</b> dyspepsia. <b>Psychological</b> <b>distress</b> is a major determinant of impaired health of dyspeptic patients in general practice and may be the clue to improvement of health status in many dyspeptic patients.    Keywords: dyspepsia; health status; general practice; Helicobacter pylori; psychological distres...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of a literature review and research report. Section 1 : Literature Review Constructs of secondary traumatic stress (STS) and vicarious traumatization (VT) have been proposed to describe {{the negative impact of}} working with traumatized clients. In previous reviews of the literature, evidence to support these constructs has been limited and inconsistent; consequently their validity has been questioned. This review seeks to reassess the evidence from recent empirical findings. The review concluded that evidence to support the constructs remains limited, but tentatively there is greater evidence to support STS in contrast to VT. Section 2 : Research Report This study investigates the extent of exposure to trauma work among trainee clinical psychologists and its impact on well-being. The study seeks to assess which theoretical model (STS, VT, or even a non-specific model <b>of</b> general <b>psychological</b> <b>distress)</b> best accounts for any negative effects associated with indirect exposure to client trauma. 564 trainees participated in an online survey, which included self-report measures <b>of</b> general <b>psychological</b> <b>distress,</b> trauma symptoms and disrupted beliefs. Most trainees had caseloads of 1 - 2 trauma cases, with the most common trauma being sexual abuse. Exposure to trauma work was not related to general <b>psychological</b> <b>distress</b> or disrupted beliefs, but {{was a significant predictor of}} trauma symptoms. Level of stress of clinical work and quality of trauma training contributed to the variance in trauma symptoms. It is concluded that the study provides support for STS and lacks evidence to support VT or a non-specific model <b>of</b> general <b>psychological</b> <b>distress.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
