5|$|Because {{game animals}} can be shot using lead bullets, the {{potential}} for lead ingestion from game meat consumption has been studied clinically and epidemiologically. In a recent {{study conducted by the}} CDC, a cohort from North Dakota was enrolled and asked to self-report historical consumption of game meat, and participation in <b>other</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> could cause lead exposure. The study found that participants' age, sex, housing age, current hobbies with potential for lead exposure, and game consumption were all associated with blood lead level (PbB).|$|E

5|$|The United States Army had {{jurisdiction}} over the national park from 1891 to 1914, followed by {{a brief period of}} civilian stewardship. The newly formed National Park Service took over the park's administration in 1916. Improvements to the park helped to increase visitation during this time. Preservationists led by Muir and the Sierra Club failed to save Hetch Hetchy Valley from becoming a reservoir in 1923. In 1964, 89 percent of the park was set aside in a highly protected wilderness area, and other protected areas were added adjacent to the park. The once-famous Yosemite Firefall, created by pushing red hot embers off a cliff near Glacier Point at night, was discontinued in the mid-to-late 20th century along with <b>other</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> were deemed to be inconsistent with protection of the national park.|$|E

25|$|While {{running and}} high-impact sports are not {{recommended}} during treatment for Perthes disease, children can remain active {{through a variety}} of <b>other</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> limit mechanical stress on the hip joint. Swimming is highly recommended, as it allows exercise of the hip muscles with full range of motion while reducing the stress to a minimum. Cycling is another good option as it also keeps stress to a minimum. Physiotherapy generally involves a series of daily exercises, with weekly meetings with a physiotherapist to monitor progress. These exercises focus on improving and maintaining a full range of motion of the femur within the hip socket. Performing these exercises during the healing process is essential to ensure that the femur and hip socket have a perfectly smooth interface. This will minimize the long-term effects of the disease. Use of bisphosphonate such as zoledronate or ibandronate is currently being investigated, but definite recommendations are not yet available.|$|E
25|$|Christmas Island is {{well known}} for its {{biological}} diversity. There are many rare species of animals and plants on the island, making nature-walking a popular activity. Along with the diversity of species, many different types of caves exist, such as plateau caves, coastal caves, raised coastal caves and alcoves, sea caves, fissure caves, collapse caves and basalt caves; most of these are near the sea and have been formed by the action of water. Altogether, there are 46 caves on the island, with Lost Lake Cave, Daniel Roux Cave and Full Frontal Cave being the most well-known. The many freshwater springs include Hosnies Spring Ramsar, which also has a mangrove stand. The Dales is a rainforest {{in the western part of}} the island and consists of seven deep valleys, all of which were formed by spring streams. Hugh's Dale waterfall is part of this area and is a popular attraction. The annual breeding migration of the red crabs is a popular event. Fishing is another common activity. There are many distinctive species of fish in the oceans surrounding Christmas Island. Snorkeling and swimming in the ocean are two <b>other</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> are extremely popular. Walking trails are also very popular, for there are many beautiful trails surrounded by extravagant flora and fauna. 63% of the island is national park making it one of the main attractions to experience when visiting.|$|E

The Secretary of State always is involved in a lot of controversial things, and here we had the McCarthy era, the attack on the whole concept of Foreign Service and the State Department, and a terrific controversy over what to do about China, who had [...] "lost China." [...] Fisher was always at Acheson's right hand when he was dealing with other people about these things. Wherever he went, Fisher's office was backstopping him, getting all the necessary background information so he'd be prepared for any kind of question that came up. Of course, Acheson's own approach to being Secretary of State was such that when you took an agreement to him to be signed, his chief question was [...] "By what authority do I sign this?" [...] And whoever brought it to him to get it signed, had to be ready with the answer that would satisfy a lawyer -- [...] "by what legal authority" [...] -- as well as what it provides and so forth.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{the smaller}} Canadian banks, the Big Five {{are not just}} Canadian banks, but are instead better {{described}} as international financial conglomerates, each with a large Canadian banking division.

2500|$|<b>Other</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> {{players can}} do in mayor mode include {{building}} civic buildings that need constant funding to work properly, such as schools, hospitals, parks, police stations, jails, and fire stations. These buildings now come in two or more sizes compared to the single, universal types {{that were used in}} previous games. Settlements also need public utilities such as electricity with more or less polluting and more or less expensive types of power stations, water pumps, water purification plants, and waste management services. Facilities that had previously provided citywide coverage, such as educational facilities and medical facilities, have now been modified to provide a more limited coverage, as it has been with police stations and fire stations in previous SimCity titles. Funding can now be adjusted for individual buildings rather than having to change the funding to all buildings, allowing users to specify how much money should be spent to supply a service in accordance to the local population. Maintenance expenses for public utility facilities will increase as they age. The maximum output of facilities also decreases as they get older. The rate at which facilities age is dependent on the percentage of its capacity being used and the level of funding being given to it.|$|E
2500|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} at {{many sites}} in Tamil Nadu including Arikamedu, Kodumanal, Kaveripumpattinam and Alagankulam, [...] have yielded a [...] variety of artifacts {{belonging to the}} Sangam era, such as various types of pottery and other items including [...] black and red ware, rouletted ware, [...] Russet coated ware, brick walls, ring wells, pits, industrial items, [...] {{and the remains of}} seeds and shells. Many of the pottery sherds contain Tamil-Brahmic inscriptions on them, which have provided additional evidence for the archaeologist to date them. Archaeologists agree that activities best illustrated in these material records are trade, hunting, agriculture and crafts. These excavations have provided evidence for the existence of the major economic activities mentioned in Sangam literature. Remnants of irrigation structures like reservoirs and ring wells and charred remains of seeds attest to the cultivation of different varieties of crops and knowledge of various agricultural techniques. Spinning whorls, cotton seeds, remains of a woven cotton cloth and dyeing vats provide evidence for the activities of the textile industry. Metallurgy has been supported by the discovery of an ancient blast furnace, along with its base and wall, anvil, slags and crucibles. The remains have indicated that, in addition to iron, the blacksmith may have worked with steel, lead, copper and bronze. The Kodumanal excavation recovered several jewellery items and semi precious stones at different stages of manufacture, suggesting that they were locally manufactured. Remains of import and export articles recovered from Arikamedu indicate the important role it played as an Indo-Roman trading station. Building construction, pearl fishery and painting are <b>other</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> have been supported by findings from these excavations.|$|E
