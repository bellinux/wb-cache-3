5|$|F. rubiginosa is {{exclusively}} pollinated in {{a symbiotic}} relationship with Pleistodontes imperialis, a species <b>of</b> <b>fig</b> wasp. Biologist Eleanor Haine and colleagues analysed the DNA of the wasp across the fig's range and determined four cryptic lineages forming what they term the P. imperialis species complex. They diverge {{to a greater degree}} than some distinct wasp species, yet form a monophyletic group; this indicates that the wasp lineages have split without a change of host.|$|E
5|$|Nematodes of {{the genus}} Schistonchus {{are found in the}} syconia (and the {{pollinator}} wasps) of many species <b>of</b> <b>fig,</b> with F. rubiginosa hosting two species. They appear to be less species-specific than wasps. S. altermacrophylla is generally associated with F. rubiginosa though it has been recorded on several other fig species.|$|E
5|$|Wasps are {{a diverse}} group, {{estimated}} at {{over a hundred}} thousand described species around the world, and a great many more as yet undescribed. For example, there are over 800 species <b>of</b> <b>fig</b> trees, mostly in the tropics, {{and almost all of}} these has its own specific fig wasp (Chalcidoidea) to effect pollination.|$|E
50|$|By chance, he {{discovered}} two fig trees in a forest. With the help <b>of</b> the <b>figs</b> he could retaliate: the first variety <b>of</b> <b>figs</b> caused {{the growth of}} huge donkey ears and a long nose; by eating the second variety <b>of</b> <b>figs,</b> it went back to normal. Dressed up as a salesman Little Muck smuggled the first variety <b>of</b> <b>figs</b> on the king's table. Shortly afterwards he dressed up as a scholar and offered the king the second variety <b>of</b> <b>figs</b> as a remedy for his and his royal court’s deformities.|$|R
50|$|Taounate {{is home to}} {{an annual}} Festival <b>of</b> <b>Figs,</b> {{organized}} by the Regional Directorate of Agriculture of Fez-Meknes. The festival includes many varieties <b>of</b> <b>figs.</b> Friday is market day in Taounate.|$|R
50|$|Mutualism occurs between fig and fig wasps, {{which creates}} {{a need for}} {{specific}} species <b>of</b> <b>figs</b> to be pollinated by specific species of wasps. The origin of mutualism is also the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>fig</b> wasp phylogeny. In the phylogenetic tree, the genus of Blastophaga and Wiebesia are very similar. Both of these genera pollinate Ficus species <b>of</b> <b>figs.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{small round}} yellow fruit ripen and turn red {{at any time}} of year, {{although}} they peak in autumn and winter (April to July). Known as a syconium, the fruit is an inverted inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. Ficusobliqua is pollinated by two species <b>of</b> <b>fig</b> wasp—Pleistodontes greenwoodi and P.xanthocephalus. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. The range is along the east coast from Queensland, through New South Wales in rainforest, savanna woodland, sclerophyll forest and gallery forest. It is used as a shade tree in parks and public spaces, and is well-suited for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai. All parts of the tree have been used in traditional medicine in Fiji.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} that Livia did supply a poisoned fig (she did cultivate a variety <b>of</b> <b>fig</b> named for her that Augustus is said to have enjoyed), but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder. Augustus' health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death, and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power, having at last reluctantly settled on Tiberius as his choice of heir. It is likely that Augustus was not expected to return alive from Nola, but it seems that his health improved once there; it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius, in order to not endanger that transition.|$|E

40|$|Pectin methylesterase (PME) causes {{considerable}} softening in intermediate-moisture (IM) figs rehydrated at 30 °C {{and cold}} stored at 28 % to 29 % moisture content. Rehydration <b>of</b> <b>figs</b> at 80 °C for 16 min inactivated PME partially (25 - 30 %), {{but this did}} not prevent the softening over 3 mo of cold storage.

In contrast, rehydration <b>of</b> <b>figs</b> 1 st in 2. 5 % H 2 O 2 at 80 °C for 8 min and then in water at 80 °C for 8 min reduced the microbial load <b>of</b> IM <b>figs</b> significantly, turned their brown color to yellow-light brown, and maintained their desired textural properties.

25|$|Figs in {{the genus}} Ficus have a mutualistic {{arrangement}} with certain tiny agaonid wasps. In the common fig, the inflorescence is a syconium, formed by an enlarged, fleshy, hollow receptacle with multiple ovaries {{on the inner}} surface. A female wasp enters through a narrow aperture, fertilises these pistillate flowers and lays its eggs in some ovaries, with galls being formed by the developing larvae. In due course, staminate flowers develop inside the syconium. Wingless male wasps hatch and mate with females in the galls before tunnelling {{their way out of}} the developing fruit. The winged females, now laden with pollen, follow, flying off to find other receptive syconia at the right stage of development. Most species <b>of</b> <b>fig</b> have their own unique commensal species of wasp.|$|E
25|$|Shepherd wrote {{a series}} of humorous short stories {{about growing up in}} {{northwest}} Indiana and its steel towns, many of which were first told by him on his programs and then published in Playboy.

Some of those situations were incorporated into his movies and television fictional stories. He also wrote a column for the early Village Voice, a column for Car and Driver, numerous individual articles for diverse publications, including Mad Magazine ("The Night People vs. Creeping Meatballism", March/April 1957), and introductions for books such as The America of George Ade, American Snapshots, and the 1970 reprint of the 1929 Johnson Smith Catalogue.|$|E

25|$|The area {{is part of}} {{the slopes}} around the Popocatépetl volcano. The highest {{elevations}} are in the north, descending gradually to the south, east and west. Major elevations include Yoteco (2110 masl), Boyero (1824 masl) and Mirador (1882 masl). There are formations of volcanic rock, including basalt. Surface water consists of runoff from Popocateptl into streams and small rivers, many of which have formed deep ravines such as the one named Yecapixtla, which begins in the State of Mexico and passes through Zahuatlán and Mexquemeca. before emptying into the Cuautla River. Other streams include Arcos de Ortiz, Malpaso or La Cuera and Del Negro. Other named ravines in the territory include Xococotla, Atlamaxa, Las Animas, Tepanche, Xalpa, Tamalera, and Remudadero. There are also a number of fresh water springs such as Chirimoyo, Las Pilas, La Tenería, La Mora, and Tepetlapa. In general, climate is warm and humid with rains falling principally from June to October. Average temperature is 19.6C, and annual rainfall is between 800 and 1000mm. There is little difference among the seasons in temperature. Overall, the north tends to be somewhat cooler than the south due to altitude. Much of the municipality is covered in pine and holm oak forest, with some other species such as amate (a type <b>of</b> <b>fig)</b> tree, casahuates and guamuchiles. Most other vegetation is deciduous. Most of the area’s wildlife has been extinguished with only various insects and reptiles to be found wild.|$|E
500|$|Figs have an obligate {{mutualism}} with fig wasps (Agaonidae); figs {{are only}} pollinated by fig wasps, and fig wasps can only reproduce in fig flowers. Generally, each fig species {{depends on a}} single species of wasp for pollination. The wasps are similarly dependent on their fig species to reproduce. The assumption that fig species are usually pollinated by just one species <b>of</b> <b>fig</b> wasp has been challenged by the discovery of cryptic species complexes among what was previously thought to be single species <b>of</b> <b>fig</b> wasps. [...] Ficus obliqua is pollinated by two species <b>of</b> <b>fig</b> wasp—Pleistodontes greenwoodi and P. xanthocephalus.|$|E

[...] Schweizer believed that many male improvisers felt threatened by FIG because of their use of humour, [...] "We were not that serious, like men, ... they take [...] so seriously". Georgie Born described FIG's humour as [...] "very iconoclastic and very surreal, or very silly. There were no big boys there standing judging."

500|$|Their later games {{would only}} take a few months each, in comparison. They {{abandoned}} the use of design documents after Dinowaurs, and instead chose to refine and experiment in process. Intuition released Effing Hail and Gray around April 2009. Players in action game Effing Hail control hail and wind to destroy the most buildings and midair objects within a time limit. The game was published through Kongregate. In Gray, players control a single character and try to end a riot by influencing other individuals in the crowd. The game was featured at IndieCade in 2009. In the case <b>of</b> <b>Fig.</b> 8., Wohlwend thought of the idea based on a college art project. In the project, Wohlwend followed a bike trail in the snow, metaphorically related it to the tribulations of romantic relationship, and made an art installation involving a bike spray-painted black with two errant red and blue tracks painted on the floor. The concept went unused on their whiteboard for four months until they needed an idea, whereupon Boxleiter added game mechanics to the visuals. In their next game, Liferaft, the player-character is a young woman set to escape [...] "a post-apocalyptic sci-fi ... test chamber", with core gameplay that revolves around a [...] "Bionic Commando-style grappling hook". Wohlwend used a 16-bit era graphics style. They sought crowdfunding from Kickstarter, but later canceled and put the project on hiatus in October 2009.|$|E
