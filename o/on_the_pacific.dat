5|$|Around 0300UTC on October4, the Government of Mexico {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for areas between Punta Abreojos and San Carlos <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast of Baja California and for areas between Santa Rosalía to Loreto on the Gulf coast of the Peninsula. Roughly twelve hours later, the warning was superseded by another tropical storm warning. The new warning was issued for areas between Punta Abreojos and El Rosario <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast and for areas between Santa Rosalia and Punta Final on the Gulf coast. In mainland Mexico, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued for coastal areas of Sonora between Cabo Lobos and Puerto Penasco. By 1830UTC, all of the watches and warnings were revised; <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast of Baja California, the warning was in effect for areas between Punta Abreojos and San Juanico; on the Gulf coast, the warning was in effect for areas between Santa Rosalia and Punta Conception; the watch for coastal areas of Sonora was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for areas between Guaymas and Cabo Lobos. Following Raymond's landfall in mainland Mexico, all warnings were discontinued by 1200UTC on October5.|$|E

5|$|In Costa Rica, 28people were killed, 75were injured, and 18were missing. Rainfall caused 20rivers {{to burst}} their banks, {{flooding}} 75settlements, including {{the city of}} Quepos, Costa Rica <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast. At Ciudad Neily, Costa Rica, the Rio Corredores broke through a dike. In total, 7,500Costa Ricans were rendered homeless. Damages in Costa Rica amounted to $65million.|$|E
5|$|In North America, extra-tropical storm surges {{may occur}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> and Alaska coasts, {{and north of}} 31°N on the Atlantic Coast.

5|$|Despite having {{settled on}} a new {{standard}} type, Gresley continued to experiment on individual locomotives, in one of which experiments ACFI feedwater heaters were installed in A1 2576 The White Knight and A3 2580 Shotover. However, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacifics</b> <b>the</b> increase in efficiency was deemed insufficient and the apparatus was eventually removed. In 1935, number 2544 Lemberg received Trofimoff piston valves of an ingenious design with automatically varying steam passages.|$|R
5|$|The type species, A. nigrofasciata, {{which used}} to cover all these species, is {{restricted}} to the northern population ranging from El Salvador to Guatemala <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast and from Honduras to Guatemala on the Atlantic coast.|$|E
5|$|There are two subspecies, {{which are}} highly similar and of dubious validity. The {{nominate}} subspecies S. n. nigrescens occurs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coastal region from British Columbia to northern California, while S. n. halseii, described by Giraud in 1841, occupies the inland parts of its range. S. n. halseii birds are slightly {{larger and more}} gray in their upperparts.|$|E
5|$|Appearing from January to April, A. ocreata occurs {{later in}} the year than other amanitas except A. calyptroderma. It is found in mixed {{woodland}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast of North America, from Washington south through California to Baja California in Mexico. It may feasibly occur on Vancouver Island in British Columbia though this has never been confirmed. It forms ectomycorrhizal relationships and is found in association with coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), as well as hazel (Corylus spp.). In Oregon and Washington, it may also be associated with the Garry oak (Quercus garryana).|$|E

5|$|Football <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Coast {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would be much better for a man of my age and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E
5|$|From the 16th {{through the}} 18thcenturies, explorers looking for routes between Spanish colonies along the Rio Grande to the {{southeast}} and other Spanish colonies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast to the west passed near or through the area, which they called El Desierto Pintado, the Painted Desert. However, the park's oldest Spanish inscriptions, left by descendants of the region's early Spanish colonists, date only to the late 19thcentury.|$|E

5|$|In 1671 Morgan {{attacked}} Panama City, {{landing on}} the Caribbean coast and traversing the isthmus before he attacked the city, which was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast. The battle was a rout, although the privateers profited less than in other raids. To appease the Spanish, with whom the English had signed a peace treaty, Morgan was arrested and summoned to London in 1672, but {{was treated as a}} hero by the general populace and the leading figures of government and royalty including Charles II.|$|E

5|$|In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu {{emerged as}} a {{principal}} centre in the Late Preclassic.

The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned; the cause of this collapse is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before it}} was named, the {{government}} of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch {{in the state of}} Baja California Sur, from Santa Fe <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coast around the peninsula to Buenavista along the Gulf of California. About 24hours prior to landfall, the watch was replaced with a warning from Santa Fe to San Evaristo, and the tropical storm watch was extended along both sides of the peninsula. Prior to it making landfall, more than 2,500families in susceptible areas left their homes. Officials opened several shelters in the area where the storm struck.|$|E
5|$|Sir Francis Drake sailed from Plymouth on 15 November 1577, {{in command}} of a fleet of five ships under his {{flagship}} Pelican, later renamed the Golden Hinde. His principal objective was plunder, not exploration; his initial targets were the unfortified Spanish towns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> coasts of Chile and Peru. Following Magellan's route, Drake reached Puerto San Julian on 20 June. After nearly two months in harbour, Drake left the port with a reduced fleet of three ships and a small pinnace. His ships entered the Magellan Strait on 23 August and emerged in the Pacific Ocean on 6 September.|$|E
