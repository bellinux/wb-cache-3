40|$|The paper {{describes}} a two-section electronic device for better recording of rapid bioelectric phenomena on the cathode-ray oscillograph screen. In section A (fig. 2), proportional brightening of the trace during transient phenomena {{is achieved by}} application of a suitable positive voltage to the cathode-ray tube grid (Z input). This voltage, proportional {{to the increase in}} writing-speed of the spot, is obtained by differentiation of the input signal. In section B (fig. 3), intensity modulation is produced by a positive square voltage applied to the grid. The square pulse is delivered by a <b>one-shot</b> <b>multivibrator,</b> triggered by the phenomenon under observation. This same device, used as a negative pulse-generator driven by an external oscillator, may produce intensity-modulated timing markers which blank the trace at known intervals. The use of either beam-intensifying device described is discussed in the paper. Â© 1956, All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Signals for {{controlling}} phase-controlled rectifier circuit are generated by combinatorial logic {{than can be}} implemented in large-scale integration (LSI). LSI circuit saves space, weight, and assembly time compared to previous controls that employ <b>one-shot</b> <b>multivibrators,</b> latches, and capacitors. LSI logic functions by sensing three phases of ac power source and by comparing actual currents with intended currents...|$|R
40|$|An {{exemplary}} {{embodiment of the}} present invention provides a source of random width and random spaced rectangular voltage pulses whose mean or average frequency of operation is controllable within prescribed limits of about 10 hertz to 1 megahertz. A pair of thin-film metal resistors are used to provide a differential white noise voltage pulse source. Pulse shaping and amplification circuitry provide relatively short duration pulses of constant amplitude which are applied to anti-bounce logic circuitry to prevent ringing effects. The pulse outputs from the anti-bounce circuits are then used to control two <b>one-shot</b> <b>multivibrators</b> whose output comprises the random length and random spaced rectangular pulses. Means are provided for monitoring, calibrating and evaluating the relative randomness of the generator...|$|R
