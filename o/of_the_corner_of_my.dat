500|$|O'Neill Surber {{explored}} {{the lyrics of}} Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to [...] "Comfortably Numb": [...] "I caught a fleeting glimpse, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot {{put my finger on}} it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone." [...] Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, [...] "Jugband Blues": [...] "I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{glanced at}} my {{opponent}} out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes. The man was suffering. Beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead.|$|E
6000|$|... "As you see, madam mother, I am at practice," [...] I answered, and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye I {{caught the}} grim {{approving}} twitch of old Falcone's lips.|$|E

60|$|At {{this moment}} Cynthia came in. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye I {{observed}} {{a look of}} fuddled displeasure come into Tanky's face at her frank pleasure at seeing me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So, {{when the}} morning came, I {{went down to}} the beach, casting out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye at the house of the mother of Unga. My offer yet stood untouched.|$|E
60|$|As I lighted a cigar I saw, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye, how Hoden gave a quick start. I {{expected}} {{some kind}} of a startling idea to flash into his mind.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Amusement park Fantasilandia, {{located in}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> Parque O'Higgins.|$|R
60|$|He looked wickedly at me out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> his grey eyes.|$|R
60|$|The Comtesse {{looked at}} him lazily out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> her sleepy eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{told me to}} {{wait until}} I was alone with you," [...] I said, {{dropping}} my voice significantly, and watching him intently out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye. I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe, creating an atmosphere.|$|E
6000|$|I took {{a little}} look at him out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye, and wished that as a child I had paid more heed to my {{arithmetic}} lessons. [...] "Look, Mrs Monnerie," [...] I cried piteously, [...] "poor Cherry's tongue is dangling right out of his head. He looks so hot and tired." ...|$|E
60|$|You {{may think}} how proud I was {{to walk down}} the village street with my {{magnificent}} relative, and to note out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye how the folk came to the doors and windows to see us pass. Champion Harrison was standing outside the smithy, and he pulled his cap off when he saw my uncle.|$|E

60|$|For {{a minute}} Crump rebuked the Angel silently out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> his eye.|$|R
6000|$|The Guardian, {{whom she}} called [...] "Shaman" [...] or Magician, held a lamp in his hand, and by its light {{it was easy}} to see his face, which I watched out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye. I thought that it wore a very strange expression, one {{moreover}} that alarmed me somewhat. From the beginning I had misdoubted me of this old man, whose cast of countenance was vindictive as it was able; now I was afraid of him.|$|E
60|$|The little beaded front-sight wavered {{slightly}} as I held my rifle leveled at the grim, snarling face, and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye, as it were, I saw Jones dash {{in under the}} lion and grasp Moze by the hind leg and haul him down. He broke from Jones and leaped again to the first low branch. His master then grasped his collar and carried him to where we stood and held him choking.|$|E
60|$|The Zulus grew excited, and {{the odds}} went down a little. The Boers {{stretched}} out their white faces {{and stared at}} me; I saw them out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye as I loaded again. Another vulture came; seeing one of its companions on the ground, if in a somewhat unnatural attitude, perhaps it thought {{that there could be}} nothing to fear. I leaned against my rock, aimed, and fired, almost carelessly, so sure was I of the result. This time I did not shut my eyes, but watched to see what happened.|$|E
60|$|What was she doing? She {{was looking}} fixedly into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room.|$|R

60|$|As I did so, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye I {{caught sight}} of {{something}} that glittered far away, so far that it would only have attracted the notice of a trained hunter. Yes, something was shining on the brow {{of the rise of}} which I have spoken. I stared at it through my glasses and saw what I had feared to see. A body of natives was crossing the rise and the glitter was caused by the rays of dawn striking on their spears and gun-barrels.|$|E
60|$|As I {{spoke the}} words I saw old Billali, who {{not being a}} man of war was keeping as close to us as he could, go flat onto his venerable face, and {{reflected}} {{that he must have}} got a thrown spear through him. Casting a hurried glance at him to see if he were done for or only wounded, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye I caught sight of something diaphanous which gleamed in the moonlight and reminded me of I knew not what at the moment.|$|E
60|$|But {{the land}} breeze {{had begun to}} die away with the rising sun, and now came only in failing puffs. The salmon boat got out its oars and soon left us far astern. Some of the Chinese stood in the forward part of the cockpit, near the cabin doors, and once, as I leaned over the cockpit rail to flatten down the jib-sheet a bit, I felt some one brush against my hip pocket. I made no sign, but out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye I saw that the Yellow Handkerchief had {{discovered}} the emptiness of the pocket which had hitherto overawed him.|$|E
60|$|So Pambasa went, {{casting a}} piteous {{look at me}} out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> his eye.|$|R
60|$|The Common-room {{looked at}} one another out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> their eyes, and Prout blushed.|$|R
60|$|Dora {{watched her}} out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> her eye {{as a cat}} watches a mouse.|$|R
60|$|For {{quite a long}} while, {{it seemed}} more than a century, he stood over me, {{studying}} me as though I interested him very much, {{the water of the}} lake trickling in a refreshing stream from his great ears on to my back. Had it not been for that water I think I should have fainted, but as it was I did the next best thing--pretended to be dead. Perhaps this monster would scorn to touch a dead man. Watching out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye, I saw him lift one vast paw that was the size of an arm-chair and hold it over me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then he said: 'But {{what does}} Ata say to it?' 'It appears {{that she has}} a <i beguin> for you,' I said. 'She's willing if you are. Shall I call her?' He chuckled in a funny, dry way he had, and I called her. She knew what I was talking about, the hussy, and I saw her out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes {{listening}} with all her ears, while she pretended to iron a blouse that she had been washing for me. She came. She was laughing, but I could see that she was a little shy, and Strickland looked at her without speaking." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently, however, by a cursed {{spite of}} fate, {{one of these}} gusts--a very little one--came from some quarter behind us, for I felt it in my back hair, that was as damp {{as the rest of}} me. Just then I was glancing to my right, where {{it seemed to me that}} out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye I had caught sight of {{something}} passing among the stones at a distance of a hundred yards or so, possibly the shadow of a cloud or another elephant. At the time I did not ascertain which it was, since a faint rattle from Jana's trunk reconcentrated all my faculties on him in a painfully vivid fashion.|$|E
50|$|Observant Jewish men {{are subject}} to {{restrictions}} on <b>the</b> shaving <b>of</b> their beards, as Leviticus 19:27 forbids <b>the</b> shaving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head and prohibits <b>the</b> marring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beard. The Hebrew word used in this verse refers specifically to shaving with a blade against the skin; rabbis at different times and places have interpreted it in many ways.|$|R
