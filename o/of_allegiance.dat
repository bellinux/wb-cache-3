50|$|With {{the trial}} and {{execution}} of Charles I, the political kaleidoscope <b>of</b> <b>allegiances</b> in Scotland changed. Sir George went from supporting the party that had opposed Charles I to that which supported Charles II, and as before he was active in both the civil and military arenas.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the mutiny, the {{division}} was moved to the Neuhammer training grounds in the Silesian region of Germany (present-day Poland) to complete its training. During the training phase, the German officers, pleased with its progress, coined the term Mujo for the Bosnian Muslims. The members of the division swore an oath <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> to both Hitler and Pavelić.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, the Confederate {{government}} of Kentucky in exile ceased to exist, and Hawes returned to his home in Paris, Kentucky. He swore an oath <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> to the Union, and was allowed to return to his law practice. He was elected county judge of Bourbon County, a post he held until his death in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Not all Texans favored secession initially, {{although}} many of the same would later support the Southern cause. Texas's most notable Unionist was the state Governor, Sam Houston. Not wanting to aggravate the situation, Houston refused two offers from President Lincoln for Union troops to keep him in office. After refusing to swear an oath <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> to the Confederacy, Houston was deposed as governor.|$|E

50|$|His {{career is}} characterised by {{frequent}} swapping <b>of</b> <b>allegiances,</b> both among Viking leaders from Dublin and the Wessex kings. Perhaps Wulfstan played {{the part of}} 'king-maker' in Northumbrian politics in the mid-10th century, or perhaps he was guided by self-preservation {{and the interests of}} the Church in Northumbria.|$|R
50|$|In Yugoslavia he {{achieved}} another {{second place in}} the championship before making a controversial switch <b>of</b> <b>allegiances</b> to local rivals Red Star, where {{at the end of his}} career, in 1960, he finally got his hands on the championship trophy. This would remain his last honour as player.|$|R
5|$|The Supreme Court has {{determined}} that the First Amendment also protects citizens from being compelled to say or pay for certain speech. For example, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943), the Supreme Court ruled that school children could not be punished for refusing either to say the pledge <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> or salute the American flag.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{alleged that}} on 15 April 2007 a ceremony {{took place at}} a milk plant in Molo where members of the network swore an oath <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> and that further meetings took place, including some which took place at William Ruto's house. In particular the prosecutor claims that a meeting took place on 22 December 2007 at Ruto's house and that guns and money were distributed to the attendees.|$|E
5|$|Abu'l-Aswar died on 19 November 1067, and {{was buried}} {{at the main}} mosque of Ganja. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Fadl II, whom he had already {{announced}} as his heir, and to whom the oath <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> (bay'ah) had been taken by the Shaddadid family, {{the army and the}} people of Arran. Apart from Fadl, Abu'l-Aswar had four more sons—Ashot, Iskandar, Manuchihr, and Marzuban—as well as an unnamed daughter, wife of the Shirvanshah Sallar.|$|E

5|$|After {{learning}} of the arrest of former governor Charles S. Morehead by federal authorities, Helm fled to Bowling Green, fearing his own arrest. Through the intervention of Warner Underwood {{he was able to}} return home on the condition that he swear an oath <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> to the Constitution. Nevertheless, federal soldiers repeatedly entered his home, encouraging his slaves to abandon him, and consuming or destroying his crops. Because the state's courts were closed on account of the war, he was unable to earn a living by practicing law. In short order his once-substantial fortune was expended, and he resorted to borrowing money to support his family.|$|E
5|$|Around 1210, Theodore {{was invited}} by his {{half-brother}} Michael I Komnenos Doukas to Epirus, where Michael had founded an independent Greek principality. Michael wanted Theodore's aid, as his only son, the future Michael II Komnenos Doukas, was underage and illegitimate, while Michael's other half-brothers {{were considered to}} lack the ability to rule. Laskaris allowed Theodore to leave, but bound him with an oath <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> to himself and his heirs. Before going to Epirus, Theodore had married Maria Petraliphaina, {{with whom he had}} four children.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{having the}} stronger, more {{powerful}} army, Carinus held the weaker position. His rule was unpopular, {{and it was}} later alleged that he had mistreated the Senate and seduced his officers' wives. It is possible that Flavius Constantius, the governor of Dalmatia and Diocletian's associate in the household guard, had already defected to Diocletian in the early spring. When the Battle of the Margus began, Carinus' prefect Aristobulus also defected. In {{the course of the}} battle, Carinus was killed by his own men. Following Diocletian's victory, both the western and the eastern armies acclaimed him augustus. Diocletian exacted an oath <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> from the defeated army and departed for Italy.|$|E

5|$|George Calvert {{went up to}} Trinity College at Oxford University, matriculating in 1593/94, {{where he}} studied foreign {{languages}} and received a bachelor's degree in 1597. As the oath <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> was compulsory {{after the age of}} sixteen, he would almost certainly have pledged conformity while at Oxford. The same pattern of conformity, whether pretended or sincere, continued through Calvert's early life. After Oxford, he moved in 1598 to London, where he studied municipal law at Lincoln's Inn for three years.|$|E
5|$|Hawes {{remained}} at Nelly's Ford until May 1865. Finally satisfied {{that it was}} safe to return to Kentucky, Hawes arrived in Paris to find his home had been burned by Union troops. Four of Hawes's sons served in the Confederate Army, including brigadier general James Morrison Hawes; only three sons returned home from the war. On September 18, 1865, Hawes took an oath <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> to the United States, and was allowed to return to his previous career as a lawyer.|$|E
5|$|In 1524 Luis Marín led a small {{party on}} a {{reconnaissance}} expedition into Chiapas. He {{set out from}} Coatzacoalcos (renamed Espíritu Santo by the Spanish), {{on the coast of}} the Gulf of Mexico. His party followed the Grijalva upriver; near modern Chiapa de Corzo the Spanish party fought and defeated the Chiapanecos. Following this battle, Marín headed into the central highlands of Chiapas; around Easter he passed through the Tzotzil Maya town Zinacantan without opposition from the inhabitants. The Zinacantecos, true to their pledge <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> two years earlier, aided the Spanish against the other indigenous peoples of the region.|$|E

5|$|In 1833, the Tolpuddle Martyrs {{founded the}} Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers. Trade unions were legal {{but because the}} members swore an oath <b>of</b> <b>allegiance,</b> they were arrested and tried in the Shire Hall. Beneath the {{courtroom}} are cells where the prisoners were held while awaiting trial. Dorchester Prison was constructed in the town during the 19th century and was used for holding convicted and remanded inmates from the local courts until it closed in December 2013. Plans have since been made to erect 189 dwellings and a museum on the site.|$|E
5|$|In 1847 a small {{political}} crisis occurred which removed Bentinck from {{the leadership and}} highlighted Disraeli's differences with his own party. In that year's general election, Lionel de Rothschild had been returned for the City of London. As a practising Jew he could not take the oath <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> in the prescribed Christian form, and therefore could not take his seat. Lord John Russell, the Whig leader who had succeeded Peel as Prime Minister and like Rothschild was a member for the City of London, proposed in the Commons that the oath should be amended to permit Jews to enter Parliament.|$|E

Falsehoods that sadly interfere with many legitimate claims to land made by other tribes.|$|R
