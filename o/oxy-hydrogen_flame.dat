25|$|The first {{crystalline}} artificial diamond simulants were synthetic white sapphire (Al2O3, pure corundum) and spinel (MgO·Al2O3, pure magnesium aluminium oxide). Both {{have been}} synthesized {{in large quantities}} since {{the first decade of}} the 20th century via the Verneuil or flame-fusion process, although spinel was not in wide use until the 1920s. The Verneuil process involves an inverted oxyhydrogen blowpipe, with purified feed powder mixed with oxygen that is carefully fed through the blowpipe. The feed powder falls through the <b>oxy-hydrogen</b> <b>flame,</b> melts, and lands on a rotating and slowly descending pedestal below. The height of the pedestal is constantly adjusted to keep its top at the optimal position below the flame, and over a number of hours the molten powder cools and crystallizes to form a single pedunculated pear or boule crystal. The process is an economical one, with crystals of up to 9 centimeters (3.5nbsp&inches) in diameter grown. Boules grown via the modern Czochralski process may weigh several kilograms.|$|E

Boracic acid {{was raised}} to the highest {{possible}} temperature by an <b>oxy-hydrogen</b> <b>flame</b> (401.), yet it gained no conducting powers sufficient to affect the galvanometer, and underwent no apparent voltaic decomposition. It seemed to be quite as bad a conductor as air. Green bottle-glass, heated in the same manner, did not gain conducting power sensible to the galvanometer. Flint glass, when highly heated, did conduct a little and decompose; and as the proportion of potash or oxide of lead was increased in the glass, the effects were more powerful. Those glasses, consisting of boracic acid on the one hand, and oxide of lead or potassa on the other, show the assumption of conducting power upon fusion and the accompanying decomposition very well.|$|E

40|$|When Mg metal {{burns in}} air the {{resulting}} rock-salt MgO smoke consists of perfect [100] cubes of about 100 nm. On contrast, {{we found that}} intensification of self-burning of Mg micropowder either by injecting it into <b>oxy-hydrogen</b> diffusion <b>flame</b> or under an infrared laser beam switches the growth mechanism producing mostly single-crystalline spheres and terraced nanoparticles. MgO molecule condensation onto primary spherical nanoparticles can account for generation of terraced nanoparticles with regular steps proportional to the nanoparticle size.

40|$|AbstractTwo-dimensional {{mapping of}} the laser-induced {{breakdown}} spectroscopy (LIBS) signal of chemical species information in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and electrolytic <b>oxy-hydrogen</b> (EOH) <b>flames</b> was performed with in situ flame diagnostics. Base LIBS signals averaged from measurements at wavelengths of 320 nm to 350 nm describe the density information of a flame. The CN LIBS signal provides the concentration of fuel, while the H/O signal represents the fuel/air equivalence ratio. Here, we demonstrate the meaningful use of two-dimensional LIBS mappings to provide key combustion information, such as density, fuel concentration, and fuel/air equivalence ratio...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} oxy-hydrogen cutting of steel plates. The first part deals with {{calculation}} of the combustion efficiency of an <b>oxy-hydrogen</b> <b>flame.</b> A device for supply of a hydrogen-oxygen mixture is described. The {{main part of the}} paper is focused on oxy-hydrogen cutting and its advantages. The main conclusions show that the cut surface is flat and very smooth, the heat-affected zone is very narrow, and the cutting speed is relatively high...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The engine {{inner wall}} surface {{temperature}} {{was measured by}} the plug blind-hole extrapolation, and multiple thermocouples were installed at different depths in the substrate. The engine wall extrapolation model of transient high temperature was established according to the basic principles of heat transfer. The transient temperatures were measured by thermocouples buried at different depths of the engine wall and fitting curve was got. The transient temperature field which was generated by the three <b>oxy-hydrogen</b> <b>flame</b> guns was used to simulate the transient high temperature field inside the engine wall. The simulated inner wall surface temperature curves of the engine could be got by the curve fitting extrapolation of temperature sensor and the infrared thermometer respectively, which show good agreement in the overall trend and at the peak point, and verify the correctness of the extrapolation model and method.

40|$|Heat flux {{and heat}} {{transfer}} coefficient profiles of an <b>oxy-hydrogen</b> <b>flame</b> used for thermal shock and thermal fatigue tests of ceramic materials were generated experimentally by measuring the heat lost by the flame throughthe small annular zones of copper block over which the flame was impinged. The copper block {{in the form of}} a hollow cylinder with water inlet and outlet facility was fabricated. In order to impinge the flame over a selected area, pyrophylite rings of varying internal diameters (dia. = 3 - 11 mm) were used. A constant flow of water through the copper block was maintained and the temperatures of the inlet and outlet water were measured to calculate the heat flow parameters. The experiments were repeated by replacing the pyrophylite discs from smaller to bigger holes, thereby, measuring heat input over gradually increasing areas. From the experimental data, the heat flux and {{heat transfer coefficient}} profiles were generated by employing standard heat loss equations...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePreliminary {{results on}} the thermal shock and thermal fatigue {{behaviour}} of alumina studied in a newly designed novel and simple test equipment are reported. The top surface of a test sample was heated by an <b>oxy-hydrogen</b> <b>flame</b> while the opposite surface was cooled to generate temperature and thermal stress gradients. The maximum stressed zone {{and the effect of}} the thickness of the sample on critical temperature difference (?TC) were studied by conducting actual experiments on plain and indented alumina specimens and also by modelling temperature and thermal stress distribution in the sample using a finite element (FE) software. It was observed that the maximum stress was experienced near the periphery of the top surface and ?TC was more for thicker samples. Thermal fatigue study was conducted by varying temperature difference of the fatigue cycles and also by inducing different crack lengths in the sample. It was observed that the fatigue life sharply decreased with increase in initial crack length or by increasing the temperature difference of the fatigue cycles. The acoustic emission (AE) signals corresponding to formation and growth of large number of micro-cracks were observe...|$|E

40|$|A test {{equipment}} {{was designed to}} study thermal shock and thermal fatigue of ceramic materials subjected to fast heating (ascending). The equipment was designed to generate thermal stress in a test specimen by heating one surface of it by an <b>oxy-hydrogen</b> <b>flame</b> while cooling the opposite surface. The sample cracked when thermal stress exceeded its mechanical strength. The in situ crack formation was detected by an acoustic emission system coupled to the set up. The hot zone temperature was measured by an infra red pyrometer. The equipment was also designed to run thermal fatigue test cycles in automatic mode between two selected temperatures. The temperature and thermal stress distribution in the test specimen were modelled using finite element software. The effect of temperature distribution of {{the top and bottom}} surfaces on thermal stresses was studied. It was observed that the thermal stress is very sensitive to the temperature distribution on the top surface and maximum near the periphery of the top surface. This was in agreement with the experimental results in which the cracks were originated from the periphery of top surface. It was also observed that the failure temperature was higher for thicker samples. xA 9; 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
