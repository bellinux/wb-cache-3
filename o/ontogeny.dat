5|$|Gould made {{significant}} contributions to evolutionary developmental biology, especially in his work <b>Ontogeny</b> and Phylogeny. In this book he emphasized the process of heterochrony, which encompasses two distinct processes: neoteny and terminal additions. Neoteny is the process where <b>ontogeny</b> is slowed down and the organism does not reach the end of its development. Terminal addition is the process by which an organism adds to its development by speeding and shortening earlier stages in the developmental process. Gould's influence in the field of evolutionary developmental biology continues to be seen today in areas such as the evolution of feathers.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Ryan Schott {{and colleagues}} made a more {{comprehensive}} analysis of cranial dome <b>ontogeny</b> in S. validum.

It also found that dome shape and size was strongly correlated with growth, and that growth was allometric (in contrast to isometric) from flat to domed, supporting Ornatotholus as a juvenile Stegoceras. They also hypothesized that this model of dome growth, with dramatic changes from juvenile to adult, was the common developmental trajectory of pachycephalosaurs. These researchers noted that though Williamson and Carr's observation that the supratemporal fenestrae closed with age was generally correct, there was still a high degree of individual variation in the size of these fenestrae, regardless {{of the size of the}} frontoparietal, and this feature may therefore have been independent of <b>ontogeny.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Evolutionary designs {{based upon}} Artificial <b>Ontogenies</b> are {{beginning}} to cross from virtual to real environments. In such systems the evolved genotype is an indirect, procedural representation of the final structure. To date, most Artificial <b>Ontogenies</b> have relied upon an error-free development process to generate their phenotypic structure. In this paper we explore the effects and consequences of developmental error on Artificial <b>Ontogenies.</b> In a simple evolutionary design task, and using an indirect procedural representation that lacks the ability to test intermediate results of development, we demonstrate the emergence of ontogenic mechanisms which are {{able to cope with}} developmental error. ...|$|R
40|$|Artificial <b>Ontogenies,</b> {{which are}} {{inspired}} by biological development, {{have been used to}} automatically generate a wide array of novel objects, some of which have recently been manufactured in the real world. The majority of these evolved designs have been evaluated in simulation as completed objects, with no attention paid to how, or even if, they can be realistically built. As a consequence, significant human effort is required to transfer the designs to the real world. One way to reduce human involvement in this regard is to evolve how to build rather than what to build, by using prescriptive rather than descriptive representations. In the context of Artificial <b>Ontogenies,</b> this requires what we call Situated Development, in which an object's development occurs in the same environment as its final evaluation. Not only does this produce su#cient information on how to build evolved designs, but it also ensures that only buildable designs are evolved. In this paper we explore the consequences of Situated Development, and demonstrate how it can be incorporated into Artificial <b>Ontogenies</b> in order to generate buildable objects, which can be sequentially assembled in a realistic 3 -D physics environment...|$|R
5|$|In 2012, Schott and Evans {{suggested}} that the regularity in squamosal ornamentation throughout the <b>ontogeny</b> of Stegoceras was consistent with species recognition, but the change from flat to domed frontoparietals in late age suggests that the function of this feature changed through <b>ontogeny,</b> and was perhaps sexually selected, possibly for intra-specific combat. In 2012, Caleb M. Brown and Anthony P. Russell {{suggested that}} the stiffened tails were probably not used as defence against flank-butting, but may have enabled the animals to take a tripodal stance during intra-specific combat, with the tail as support. Brown and Russell found that the tail could thereby help in resisting compressive, tensile, and torsional loading when the animal delivered or received blows with the dome.|$|E

40|$|Phylogenetic changes arise by {{modifications}} of ancestral <b>ontogenies.</b> However, we {{are restricted to}} studying outgroups, not ancestors, so the search for ancestral <b>ontogenies</b> depends on appropriate choice of taxa for study. Alosa sapidissima was chosen for detailed embryological analysis because American shad are members of an early lineage within teleosts and may retain more characters common to the ancestor of teleosts than do more derived lineages. An objective of my research is to determine ancestral <b>ontogenies</b> and modifications that led to modern teleostean <b>ontogenies</b> using outgroup comparisons. ^ I collected a developmental series of hatchery-reared shad spanning the period from fertilization to metamorphosis. Using light and scanning electron microscopy I described embryological development of shad and formulated an anatomical staging system based on external and osteological features. New information about the early development of shad includes: (1) the unique radial polarity of the first neuromast organ to develop, (2) possession of an extensive neuromast line on the trunk in embryonic and larval shad, (3) formation of the autogenous hypural 1 in the caudal fin, and (4) development of gill filaments and operculum long after the yolk-sac larval period, almost at metamorphosis. These features have important functional and physiological implications for shad which need further study. ^ From my description of shad and my working knowledge of embryology I chose a series of developmental events likely to be common to all taxa of teleosts and formulated a representative staging system. I made explicit comparisons between my staging system and published descriptions for other actinopterygian fishes. The staging system and comparisons are summarized in an extensive series of tables, which show heterochronic differences among taxa. Examples of heterochronic shifts include: (1) shifts in form and timing of neurulation, (2) shifts in initial organogenesis relative to epiboly, and (3) shifts in hatching relative to jaw formation. Seven characters were {{used to examine the}} phylogenetic relationships of neopterygian fishes. ^ Basic objectives of comparative embryology have not changed but methods used for descriptive embryology and our conception of how to make phylogenetic comparisons have changed.

40|$|Abstract. —Despite the {{potential}} {{information that may}} lie in phylogenetic analyses of <b>ontogenies</b> of body form, {{few studies have examined}} methods for extracting and analyzing ontogenetic shape characters. We propose and exemplify a procedure for phylogenetic shape analysis. We use the thin-plate spline decomposed by its partial warps, a method that has several critical advantages over available alternatives. Most notably, shape variables extracted by this method refer to local-izable features of the morphology. We demonstrate how these characters can be coded and include them in a phylogenetic analysis of the piranha genus Pygocentrus, using a data set also comprising meristic, myological, and osteological characters. Using <b>ontogenies</b> of these localized shape vari-ables, we have corroborated the monophyly of Pygocentrus. Although we found no new characters corroborating the proposed sister-group relationship of P. nattereri and P. cariba, our characters are all congruent with this hypothesis. Several ontogenetic shape characters serve to diagnose the previously undiagnosed P. nattereri. Independence of ontogenetic shape features is assessed {{in the same manner as}} for any other features: by examination of their distributions on the corroborated cladogram.

The embryos within these eggs {{are some of the most}} well-preserved of any oviraptorids, providing new information on oviraptorid <b>ontogeny.</b> The specimens show a relatively shallow head which indicates that as oviraptorids matured, their skulls grew dorsoventrally (top-to-bottom) faster than anteroposteriorly (front-to-back). This growth pattern is unusual among theropods, but is also seen in derived ("advanced") tyrannosaurids. Also unusual is that, even at this early stage of development, the nasal bones are fused. Coincidentally, tyrannosaurids also show fusion of the nasals early in development.|$|E
40|$|Bilaterian animal {{body plan}} origins are not solely about adult forms. Most animals have larvae with body plans, <b>ontogenies</b> and ecologies {{distinct}} from adults. There are two primary hypotheses for larval origins. The first hypothesis {{suggests that the}} first animals were small pelagic forms similar to modern larvae, with adult bilaterian body plans evolved subsequently. The second hypothesis suggests that adult bilaterian body plans evolved first and that larval body plans arose by interpolation of features into direct-developing <b>ontogenies.</b> The two hypotheses have different consequences for understanding parsimony in evolution of larvae and of developmental genetic mechanisms. If primitive metazoans were like modern larvae and distinct adult forms evolved independently, there should be little commonality of patterning genes among adult body plans. However, sharing of patterning genes is observed. If larvae arose by co-option of adult bilaterian-expressed genes into independently evolved larval forms, larvae may show morphological convergence, but with distinct patterning genes, and this is observed. Thus, comparative studies of gene expression support independent origins of larval features. Precambrian and Cambrian embryonic fossils are also consistent with direct development of the adult as being primitive, with planktonic larvae arising during the Cambrian. Larvae have continued to co-opt genes and evolve new features, allowing study of developmental evolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{connection}} between development and evolution {{has become the}} focus of an increasing amount of research in recent years, and heterochrony has long been a key concept in this relation. Heterochrony is defined as evolutionary change in rates and timing of developmental processes; the dimension of time is therefore an essential part in studies of heterochrony. Over the past two decades, evolutionary biologists have used several methodological frameworks to analyse heterochrony, which differ substantially in the way they characterize evolutionary changes in <b>ontogenies</b> and in the resulting classification, although they mostly use the same terms. This review examines how these methods compare ancestral and descendant <b>ontogenies,</b> emphasizing their differences and the potential for contradictory results from analyses using different frameworks. One of the two principal methods uses a clock as a graphical display for comparisons of size, shape and age at a particular ontogenic stage, whereas the other characterizes a developmental process by its time of onset, rate, and time of cessation. The literature on human heterochrony provides particularly clear examples of how these differences produce apparent contradictions when applied to the same problem. Developmental biologists recently have extended the concept of heterochrony to the earliest stages of development and have applied it at the cellular and molecular scale.

5|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have historically}} been proposed for the variation seen in the skulls of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs. Brown and Schlaikjer suggested that there was sexual dimorphism {{in the degree of}} doming, and hypothesized that flat-headed specimens such as AMNH5450 (Ornatotholus) represented the female morph of Stegoceras. This idea was supported by a 1981 morphometric study by Champan and colleagues, which found that males had larger and thicker domes. After other flat-headed pachycephalosaurs were discovered, the degree of doming was proposed to be a feature with taxonomic importance, and AMNH5450 was therefore considered a distinct taxon from 1979 onwards. In 1998, Goodwin and colleagues instead proposed that the inflation of the dome was an ontogenetic feature that changed with age, based on a histological study of an S. validum skull that showed the dome consisted of vascular, fast-growing bone, consistent with an increase in doming through age. These authors found that the supposedly distinct features of Ornatotholus could easily be the results of <b>ontogeny.</b>|$|E
5|$|The loss {{of teeth}} with age in Limusaurus {{is the most}} extreme case of tooth {{morphology}} changing with age among dinosaurs.

Its complicated pattern of losing teeth from both the front and the back is most {{similar to that of the}} avialan Jeholornis. The temporary halt in tooth replacement likely results from the replacement tooth buds regressing, as in the veiled chameleon. Combined with the retention of the developmental signal pathways necessary to induce tooth development in birds, the ontogenetic replacement of teeth by a beak in Limusaurus suggests that the development of beaks in other lineages of theropods, and indeed beaked animals in general, may be related to developmental changes that heterochronically alter the point at which tooth development halts.|$|E

We show that the conjunction of the latent ontogenic stucture and the common practice of only evaluating the final phenotype obtained from development can have a net retarding effect on evolution. Using a formal model of development, we show that this effect arises primarily due to the relation between the ontogenic structure to the fitness function, which in turn impacts the properties being evaluated and selected for during evolution.

5|$|Ampelosaurus {{seems to}} {{have grown in a}} way similar to more basal sauropods. After a certain point in its development, the {{microscopic}} material of the bone became very different from more basal Sauropoda. Ampelosaurus grew more slowly once the bone microstructure became unique among sauropods. Although Diplodocoidea and basal Macronaria also show an increase in bone growth and a decrease in growth rate around the presumed onset of sexual maturity, it is much more gradual than Ampelosaurus. The process of growing, which in other sauropods started around sexual maturity, was clearly delayed in Ampelosaurus. The period of growth after sexual maturity seems to be shortened in Ampelosaurus and is dominated by slow bone building instead of fast growth. Growth marks are generally rare in sauropods or appearing only late in <b>ontogeny,</b> if at all. The lack of growth marks is suggestive of fast and continuous growth in sauropods, which supports the hypothesis that they achieved large body size through because of fast growth. Ampelosaurus does not show growth marks on any bone sample. This is unusual to be found with the apparently reduced growth rate and high level of bone growth seen in it, as those features are often associated with the occurrence of growth marks.|$|E
5|$|Paranota plus leg gene {{recruitment}} hypothesis: The fossil larvae of Coxoplectoptera provided {{important new}} {{clues to the}} disputed question of the evolutionary origin of insect wings. Before the larvae fossil discovery the paranotal-hypothesis and the leg-exite-hypothesis have been considered as incompatible alternative explanations, which have both been supported {{by a set of}} evidences from the fossil record, comparative morphology, developmental biology and genetics. The expression of leg genes in the <b>ontogeny</b> of the insect wing has been universally considered as conclusive evidence in favour of the leg-exite-hypothesis, which proposes that insect wings are derived from mobile leg appendages (exites). However, the larvae of Coxoplectoptera show that the abdominal gills of mayflies and their ancestors, which are generally considered as corresponding structures to insect wings, articulated within the dorsal tergite plates. This cannot be seen in modern mayfly larvae, because their abdominal tergites and sternites are fused to rings, without any traces left even in embryonic development. If larval gills and wings are corresponding ("serial homologous") structures and thus share the same evolutionary origin, the new results from Coxoplectoptera demonstrate that also wings are of tergal origin, as proposed by the classical paranotal-hypothesis. Staniczek, Bechly & Godunko (2011) therefore suggested a new hypothesis that could reconcile the apparently conflicting evidence from paleontology and developmental genetics: wings first originated as stiff outgrowths of tergal plates (paranota), and only later in evolution became mobile, articulated appendages through secondary recruiting of leg genes.|$|E
5|$|The diet of oviraptorids {{has been}} {{interpreted}} in various ways since the time Oviraptor was wrongly {{thought to have been}} a predator of eggs. It has been suggested that oviraptorosaurs as a whole were herbivores, which is supported by the gastroliths (stomach stones) found in Caudipteryx, and the wear facets in the teeth of Incisivosaurus. In 2010 Longrich and colleagues found that oviraptorid jaws had features similar to those seen in herbivorous tetrapods (four-limbed animals), especially those of dicynodonts, an extinct group of synapsid stem-mammals. Oviraptorids and dicynodonts share features such as short, deep, and toothless mandibles; elongated dentary symphyses; elongated mandibular fenestrae; and a downwards-projecting bar in the palate. Modern animals with jaws that resemble those of oviraptorids include parrots and tortoises; the latter group also has tooth-like projections on their premaxillae. Longrich and colleagues concluded that due to the similarities between oviraptorids and herbivorous animals, the bulk of their diet would most likely have been formed by plant matter. Oviraptorids are found at high frequencies in the formations they are known from, similar to the pattern seen in dinosaurs that are known to be herbivorous; these animals were more abundant than carnivorous dinosaurs, as more energy was available at their lower trophic level in the food chain. The jaws of oviraptorids may have been specialised for processing food, such as xerophytic vegetation (adapted for environments with little water), that would have grown in their environment, but this is not possible to demonstrate, as {{little is known about the}} flora of the area at the time. A 2013 study by Lü and colleagues found that oviraptorids appear to have retained their hind limb proportions throughout <b>ontogeny</b> (growth), which is also a pattern mainly seen in herbivorous animals.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{variation}} in body growth (cross-sectional {{height and weight}} velocity) among a sample of 22 small-scale societies. Considerable {{variation in}} growth exists among hunter-gatherers that overlaps heavily with growth trajectories present in groups focusing more on horticulture. Intergroup variation tends to track environmental conditions, with societies under more favorable conditions displaying faster growth and earlier puberty. In addition, faster/earlier development in females is correlated with higher mortality. For example, African “Pygmies,” Philippine “Negritos,” and the Hiwi of Venezuela are characterized by relatively fast child-juvenile growth for their adult body size (used {{as a proxy for}} energetic availability). In these societies, subadult survival is low, and puberty, menarche, and first reproduction are relatively early (given their adult body size), suggesting selective pressure for accelerated development in the face of higher mortality. In sum, the origin and maintenance of different human <b>ontogenies</b> may require explanations invoking both environmental constraints and selective pressures. Am. J. Hum.
