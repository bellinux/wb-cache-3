While working for The Walt Disney Company, Katzenberg suggested this idea to Michael Eisner, but he refused. The idea for the film was brought back at the formation of DreamWorks SKG in 1994, when Katzenberg's partners, Amblin Entertainment founder Steven Spielberg, and music producer David Geffen, were meeting in Spielberg's living room. Katzenberg recalls that Spielberg looked at him during the meeting and said, [...] "You <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> The Ten Commandments." ...|$|E

[...] Cruft overhauled the bookkeeping in the shop, changing it from a system using crosses to distinguish between wholesale and retail customers to a far more detailed system. The Maltese cross that was previously used in the bookkeeping was later instead stamped onto the biscuits as a type of trademark to distinguish Spratt's biscuits from other dog biscuits.|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} to St. James's Palace, Churchill's {{attention}} was drawn towards other matters, and to a fresh face at court. [...] "I beg you will let me see you {{as often as you}} can", pleaded Churchill in a letter to Sarah Jennings, [...] "which I am sure you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> if you care for my love..." [...] Sarah Jennings' social origins were in many ways similar to Churchill's – minor gentry blighted by debt-induced poverty. After her father's death when she was eight, Sarah, together with her mother and sisters, moved to London. As Royalist supporters (despite the fact that Sarah's great uncle, James Temple, was convicted of regicide), the Jennings' loyalty to the crown, like the Churchill's, was repaid with court employment, and in 1673 Sarah followed her sister Frances into the household of the Duchess of York, Mary of Modena, second wife to James, Duke of York.|$|E

500|$|Tchaikovsky's {{relationship}} with Rimsky-Korsakov {{had gone through}} changes {{by the time he}} visited St. Petersburg in November 1887. As a member of The Five, Rimsky-Korsakov had been essentially self-educated as a composer. He regarded Tchaikovsky with suspicion since he possessed an academic background and did not agree with the musical philosophy espoused by The Five. However, when Rimsky-Korsakov was appointed to a professorship at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1871, he recognized that he was ill-prepared to take on such a task. He had also reached a compositional impasse, and realized he was essentially on a creative path leading nowhere. He sent a letter to Tchaikovsky in which he outlined his situation and asked what he <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> The letter [...] "deeply touched and amazed" [...] Tchaikovsky with its poignancy. As Tchaikovsky later relayed to Nadezhda von Meck, [...] "Of course he had to study".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the initial}} {{announcement}} of its revival, {{the race was}} subject to criticism in light of Azerbaijan's human rights record as the race was established with the financial support of the Azerbaijani government. On 7 June 2016, the organisation Sport for Rights called for Bernie Ecclestone to speak out about the human rights situation in the country, having written {{an open letter to}} him to which Ecclestone had not replied. Sport for Rights {{made it clear that they}} did not call for a cancellation of the race, but instead urged the sport to use the race to promote these issues in public. Ecclestone replied a week later, saying that Formula One had [...] "a clear conscience" [...] on human rights and added: [...] "I tell you what we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> As far as we are concerned, not have any races where there is corruption in the country.

500|$|In October 1888 Lang {{was elected}} to an All Souls Fellowship, and began to divide his time between London and Oxford. Some of his Oxford friends were {{training}} for ordination and Lang was often drawn into their discussions. Eventually the question entered Lang's mind: [...] "Why shouldn't you be ordained?" [...] The thought persisted, and one Sunday evening in early 1889, after {{a visit to the}} theological college at Cuddesdon, Lang attended evening service at the Cuddesdon parish church. By his own account, during the sermon he was gripped by [...] "a masterful inward voice" [...] which told him [...] "You are wanted. You are called. You must obey." [...] He immediately severed his connection with the Bar, renounced his political ambitions and applied for a place at Cuddesdon College. With the help of an All Souls contact, the essential step of his confirmation into the Church of England was supervised by the Bishop of Lincoln. Lang's decision to become an Anglican and seek ordination disappointed his Presbyterian father, who nevertheless wrote to his son: [...] "What you think, prayerfully and solemnly, you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> – you must do – we will accept." ...|$|E

500|$|One day, {{the protagonists}} {{seek out a}} dervish known as a great philosopher of the land. Pangloss asks him why Man is made to suffer so, and what they all <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> The dervish {{responds}} by asking rhetorically why Pangloss {{is concerned about the}} existence of evil and good. The dervish describes human beings as mice on a ship sent by a king to Egypt; their comfort does not matter to the king. The dervish then slams his door on the group. Returning to their farm, Candide, Pangloss, and Martin meet a Turk whose philosophy is to devote his life only to simple work and not concern himself with external affairs. He and his four children cultivate a small area of land, and the work keeps them [...] "free of three great evils: boredom, vice, and poverty." [...] Candide, Pangloss, Martin, Cunégonde, Paquette, Cacambo, the old woman, and Brother Giroflée all set to work on this [...] "commendable plan" [...] (louable dessein) on their farm, each exercising his or her own talents. Candide ignores Pangloss's insistence that all turned out for the best by necessity, instead telling him [...] "we must cultivate our garden" [...] (il faut cultiver notre jardin).|$|E
500|$|Dunglass {{had shown}} little {{interest}} in politics while at Eton or Oxford. He had not joined the Oxford Union as budding politicians usually did. However, as heir to the family estates he was doubtful {{about the prospect of}} life as a country gentleman: [...] "I was always rather discontented with this role and felt it wasn't going to be enough." [...] His biographer David Dutton believes that Dunglass became interested in politics because of the widespread unemployment and poverty in the Scottish lowlands where his family lived. Later in his career, when he had become Prime Minister, Dunglass (by then Sir Alec Douglas-Home) wrote in a memorandum: [...] "I went into politics because I felt that it was a form of public service and that as nearly a generation of politicians had been cut down in the first war those who had anything to give in the way of leadership <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so." [...] His political thinking was influenced by that of Noel Skelton, a member of the Unionist party (as the Conservatives were called in Scotland between 1912 and 1965). Skelton advocated [...] "a property-owning democracy", based on share-options for workers and industrial democracy. Dunglass was not persuaded by the socialist ideal of public ownership. He shared Skelton's view that [...] "what everybody owns nobody owns".|$|E
500|$|In 1871, {{before leaving}} Hawaii, Archdeacon Mason {{informed}} Iaukea that had Kamehameha IV still been living, {{he would have}} intended for him to continue his education in Europe, and eventually to groom him to become an ordained chaplain for the royal family. Iaukea was deeply touched by the high expectations of his deceased benefactor. After finishing his education, he served King Kamehameha V as a kāhili bearer and steward at the palace, awaiting an assignment from the king. In 1872, the king sent Iaukea and William K. Hutchison, the son of Ferdinand William Hutchison, to Lahaina where they learned the art of sugar boiling in the growing sugar industry on Maui, and helped manage the West Maui Sugar Plantation, in which the king had a share. They were placed {{under the care of}} Governor Paul Nahaolelua. After the king's death in 1872, Iaukea briefly left his service to the royal court and moved to Hilo to live with his sister Maraea and her husband Charles Akono Nui Akau, a Chinese-Hawaiian manager of the Paukaʻa Sugar Plantation. The listless Iaukea enjoyed his new-found independence, but he also felt unfulfilled. He later wrote: [...] "I was dangling at a loose end. And even though I was enjoying my independence, I was aware that I did not know just where I was going or what I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I was frustrated without realizing it." ...|$|E

500|$|The creators wanted Phineas, like Ferb, to be a {{character}} who would never [...] " [...] anything with any ," [...] or to agitate his sister or outsmart his mother purposely. Instead, the character {{was supposed to be}} motivated only by enjoyment and free from mean spiritedness. He is generous, kind, and optimistic, and several of his plots involve helping someone out. He tries to please his sister Candace, carving her face into Mount Rushmore for her birthday in one episode and helping her retrieve a tape detailing his summer adventures even though she intended on using the footage as evidence to [...] "bust" [...] him and Ferb. Another episode has him throwing an extravaganza for his mother's birthday, and yet another has him (along with Ferb and Candace) recreating their parent's most romantic moment for their wedding anniversary. He has also been shown helping his grandparents, reenacting his grandfather Reginald's daredevil stunt from his youth and setting up a roller derby for a rematch race with his grandmother Betty Jo's old rival. In the episodes [...] "One Good Scare <b>Ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> It!" [...] and [...] "Hail Doofania!", Phineas goes to great lengths to help his friend Isabella. [...] Other episodes, like [...] "Unfair Science Fair," [...] "Oil on Candace," [...] "The Bully Code," [...] and [...] "Voyage To The Bottom of Buford," [...] further explore Phineas's generosity toward all of his friends. He even has plans at the beginning of [...] "The Bully Code" [...] for a jellybean currency system for emerging nations.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{independence}} being declared, a Committee of Five {{was charged with}} drafting the Declaration, and included Adams, along with Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston and Roger Sherman. The Committee, after discussing the general outline that the document should follow, decided that Jefferson would write the first draft. Jefferson particularly thought Adams should write the document; but Adams persuaded the Committee to choose Jefferson while agreeing to consult with Jefferson personally. Adams recorded his exchange with Jefferson on the question: Jefferson asked, [...] "Why will you not? You <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] To which Adams responded, [...] "I will not – reasons enough." [...] Jefferson replied, [...] "What can be your reasons?" [...] And Adams responded, [...] "Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear {{at the head of}} this business. Reason second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I can." [...] "Well," [...] said Jefferson, [...] "if you are decided, I will do as well as I can." [...] Adams concluded, [...] "Very well. When you have drawn it up, we will have a meeting." [...] The Committee left no minutes, and the drafting process itself is uncertain – accounts written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, although frequently cited, are otherwise contradictory. Although the first draft was written primarily by Jefferson, Adams assumed a primary role in its completion. After editing the document further, Congress approved it on July 4. Many years later Jefferson hailed Adams as [...] "the pillar of [...] support on the floor of Congress, [...] ablest advocate and defender against the multifarious assaults it encountered." ...|$|E
