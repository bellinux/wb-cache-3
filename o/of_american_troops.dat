5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, George Washington was interned by the then-neutral United States, until that country entered into the conflict in April 1917. George Washington was seized by the United States and taken over {{for use as a}} troop transport by the U.S. Navy. Commissioned as USS George Washington (ID-3018), she sailed with her first load <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> in December 1917.|$|E
5|$|As {{her career}} as an Army {{transport}} began, Princess Matoika picked up where her Navy career had ended and continued the return <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> from Europe. After returning to France she loaded 2,965troops at Brest—including Brigadier General W. P. Richardson {{and members of the}} Polar Bear Expedition, part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War—for a return to New York on 15 October. In December, Congressman Charles H. Randall (Prohibitionist-CA) and his wife sailed on the Matoika to Puerto Rico and the Panama Canal.|$|E

50|$|After {{some early}} unrest {{a long period}} of {{relative}} calm followed, despite the occasional high-profile incident such as the 2006 assassination of the governor, by a suicide bomber.

5|$|In August 1943, Goodenough Island {{was chosen}} as the site for a number of {{hospitals}} to treat casualties incurred as Allied forces advanced through the Pacific. Work on the 750-bed 360th Station Hospital commenced on 15 September 1943, followed by the 1,000-bed 9th General Hospital on 4 November. A staging area for 60,000troops was also established on the island. Thousands <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> later passed through Goodenough Island before the base was closed at the end of 1944.|$|E
5|$|Operations {{against the}} Japanese {{observation}} posts began in June. On the {{fifth of the}} month a patrol <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> attacked the position at Awul, causing its garrison to retreat into {{the centre of the}} island. Other attacks by the AIB force followed, and by early September all of the Japanese observation posts west of Wide Bay had been destroyed. Japanese troops conducted small scale reprisals against the native population of the Wide Bay hinterland, and the AIB officers attempted to persuade the population of this area to move inland before more severe reprisals were conducted.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the player has to allocate a number <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> in order to establish a beachhead on one of the six beaches of the island. However, many of the beaches are scattered with land mines and may provide an initial disadvantage to the assault. Throughout the game, the player may call in air strikes and other assaults, however they are only available after the American forces are attacked or if the enemy retreats to an inaccessible location. At any time in the game, the player is also able to request troop reinforcements from the fleet. Furthermore, Japanese air forces may sink American battleships throughout the game, although the player will {{be given the opportunity to}} shoot them down. In addition, a Japanese submarine will sink American gunboats at random intervals, and cannot be destroyed in any way. There is no save function in the game.|$|E

50|$|On 6 June 1813 the {{settlement}} garnered some notability during the War of 1812 {{as the site}} of the eponymous battle. After being informed <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>troop</b> movements by Billy Green, a local hero and the namesake of Billy Green elementary school, British forces overwhelmed the Americans in a surprise night attack.|$|R
5|$|The debacle at Kasserine Pass {{strained}} {{relations between}} the Allies, and another crisis developed when II Corps reported that enemy aviation was operating at will over its sector because of an absence of Allied air cover. This elicited a scathing response from British Air Marshal Arthur Coningham on the competence <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops.</b> Eisenhower drafted a letter to Marshall suggesting that Coningham should be relieved of his command since he could not control the acrimony between senior Allied commanders, but Smith persuaded him not to send it. Instead, Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder, Major General Carl Spaatz, and Brigadier General Laurence S. Kuter paid Patton a visit at his headquarters. Their meeting {{was interrupted by a}} German air raid that convinced the airmen that General Patton had a point. Coningham withdrew his written criticisms and he apologized.|$|E
5|$|Washington and the American {{command in}} Saigon {{considered}} the operation a great success, {{both as a}} test of the new American policy of Vietnamization and in setting back any communist offensives planned against the Saigon area during the next year. The logistical haul overrun and captured by the allied forces in the Base Areas was indeed impressive. 20,000 individual and 2,500 crew-served weapons; 7,000 tons of rice; 1,800 tons of munitions; 140,000 rockets and artillery shells; 435 vehicles; 29 tons of communications equipment; 55 tons of medical supplies; and 199,552 anti-aircraft rounds. The incursion was, however, limited in its scale and scope. Nixon had limited the depth of penetration by U.S. forces to 35 kilometers and placed a 30 June deadline for the withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> to South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|After the Villa Expedition, Patton was {{detailed}} to Front Royal, Virginia, {{to oversee}} horse procurement for the Army, but Pershing intervened on his behalf. After the United States entered World War I, and Pershing was named {{commander of the}} American Expeditionary Force (AEF) on the Western Front, Patton requested to join his staff. Patton was promoted to captain on May 15, 1917 and left for Europe, among the 180 men of Pershing's advance party which departed May 28 and arrived in Liverpool, England, on June 8. Taken as Pershing's personal aide, Patton oversaw the training <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> in Paris until September, then moved to Chaumont and assigned as a post adjutant, commanding the headquarters company overseeing the base. Patton was dissatisfied with the post and began to {{take an interest in}} tanks, as Pershing sought to give him command of an infantry battalion. While in a hospital for jaundice, Patton met Colonel Fox Conner, who encouraged him to work with tanks instead of infantry.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the return}} of the AIF {{divisions}} to Australia from the Middle East in 1942 coincided with the arrival of large numbers <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops,</b> including the US 32nd and 41st Infantry Divisions. From April 1942 MacArthur took over command of all US and Australian forces in the newly formed South West Pacific Area as Supreme Commander. Blamey had been appointed Commander-in-Chief AMF in March following his promotion to general, setting up Land Headquarters to subsume the role of the Military Board, which was suspended on 30 July. As Commander-in-Chief AMF he reported directly to MacArthur and was subsequently also given command of Allied Land Forces in the theatre. Yet although Australian forces made up the bulk of the Allied forces in SWPA until 1944 in practice for political reasons MacArthur ensured that Blamey only commanded Australian forces, while he also limited the number of Australian staff officers posted to General Headquarters, and they remained underrepresented {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The Ojo de Agua Raid was {{the last}} {{important}} military engagement between Mexican Seditionistas and the United States Army. It took place at Ojo de Agua, Texas. As part of the Plan of San Diego, the rebels launched a raid across the Rio Grande into Texas on October 21, 1915 aimed at harassing the American outposts along the Mexican border and disrupting the local economy. After moving across the border, the Seditionistas began an assault against the United States Army Signal Corps station at Ojo de Agua. The small group of American defenders was cornered into a single building and suffered heavy casualties before reinforcements arrived driving the Seditionist force back into Mexico. The raid {{proved to be the}} tipping point in the American conflict with the Seditionistas, as its severity convinced American officials to send large numbers <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> to the area in order to deter any further serious border raids by the Mexican force.|$|E
