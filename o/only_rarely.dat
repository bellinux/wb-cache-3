5|$|The Siberian accentor breeds in a belt across {{northern}} Russia {{east from}} {{just west of}} the Ural Mountains to the Pacific coast, with a second, more fragmented, band across southern Siberia.

5|$|The common {{chiffchaff}} is {{occasionally a}} host of brood parasitic cuckoos, including the common and Horsfield's cuckoos, but it recognises and rejects non-mimetic eggs and is therefore <b>only</b> <b>rarely</b> successfully brood-parasitised. Like other passerine birds, the common chiffchaff can also acquire intestinal nematode parasites and external ticks.|$|E
5|$|Círdan (Shipwright) is the epessë of a Telerin Elf who {{remained}} in Beleriand, and later Lindon, {{until the end of}} the Third Age.

5|$|In late 1970, Young's brother, Chris died aged 31, {{an event}} which {{affected}} Young deeply. His performances for Manchester City suffered as a result. He played approximately half the matches in the 1970–71 season, scoring only two goals. In the following season, he featured <b>only</b> <b>rarely,</b> {{and made his}} last appearance for the club on 16 October 1971, as a substitute against Leeds United.|$|E
5|$|Many envisioned {{starting}} a silk {{industry in the}} British colonies in America, starting in 1619, under the reign of King James I of England. The silk industry in the colonies never became very large. Likewise, silk was introduced to numerous other countries, including Mexico, where it was brought by Cortez in 1522. <b>Only</b> <b>rarely</b> did these new silk industries grow to any significant size.|$|E
5|$|The Penguin Jazz Guide {{commented that}} Hope's {{compositions}} were strongly melodic, with some containing concepts of fugue and canon taken from classical music, but retaining foundations in the blues. Atkins stated that Hope wrote highly structured, complex compositions that {{he played with}} improvisational flexibility. Mathieson pointed out that, despite the originality of Hope's compositions, they have been taken up by other musicians <b>only</b> <b>rarely,</b> as they are tied to Hope's idiosyncratic form of expression and remain difficult to play.|$|E

5|$|During much of Anne’s reign, the Duke of Marlborough was abroad {{fighting}} the War of the Spanish Succession, while Sarah remained in England. Despite {{being the most}} powerful woman in England besides the Queen, she appeared at court <b>only</b> <b>rarely,</b> preferring to oversee the construction of her new estate, Woodstock Manor (the site of the later Blenheim Palace), a gift from Queen Anne after the duke's victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Nevertheless, Anne sent her news of political developments in letters and consulted Sarah's advice in most matters.|$|E
5|$|Foliot {{spent most}} of his tenure of office in his diocese, <b>only</b> <b>rarely</b> {{attending}} the royal court or being assigned governmental duties. On 30 December 1223, Foliot assumed one of those duties, when he took custody of Hereford Castle after it was surrendered by Hubert de Burgh, during the redistribution of royal castles when de Burgh ousted des Roches from power. He also was appointed to determine the size of the royal forest in Gloucestershire. Foliot also founded a hospital in Ledbury, devoted to St Katherine. He helped found Alberbury Priory, a house of the Grandmontine order. In his cathedral, he reorganised the benefices and offices of the chapter, as well as endowing further benefices.|$|E
5|$|Given its {{formidable}} {{size and}} dentition, the silky shark {{is regarded as}} potentially dangerous to humans. However, it <b>only</b> <b>rarely</b> comes into contact with people due to its oceanic habits. Its natural curiosity and boldness may lead it to repeatedly and closely approach divers, and it can become dangerously excited {{in the presence of}} food. The silky shark tends to be more aggressive if encountered on a reef than in open water. Cases of individual sharks persistently harassing divers and even forcing them out of the water have been reported. As of May 2009, the International Shark Attack File lists six attacks attributable to the silky shark, three of them unprovoked and none fatal.|$|E

5|$|Healthy {{adults do}} not have many predators, but human {{activities}} pose many threats. Collisions with power lines, hunting, intentional poisoning, lead accumulation from ingesting gunshot in carcasses, and pesticide accumulation take a toll on populations. Young birds at the nest are sometimes taken by golden eagles, eagle owls, and red foxes. <b>Only</b> <b>rarely</b> do adult birds attempt to drive away predators. Young birds that fall off of cliff ledges may be preyed on by mammalian predators such as jackals, foxes and wolves. Like all birds they serve as hosts for ectoparasitic birdlice including Aegypoecus perspicuus as well as organisms that live within them such as mycoplasmas.|$|E
5|$|Humpbacks feed {{primarily}} {{in summer and}} live off fat reserves during winter. They feed <b>only</b> <b>rarely</b> and opportunistically in their wintering waters. The humpback is an energetic hunter, taking krill and small schooling fish such as juvenile Atlantic and Pacific salmon, herring, capelin and American sand lance, as well as Atlantic mackerel, pollock and haddock in the North Atlantic. They have been documented opportunistically feeding near fish hatcheries in Southeast Alaska, feasting on salmon fry released from the hatcheries. Krill and copepods are prey species in Australian and Antarctic waters. Humpbacks hunt by direct attack or by stunning prey by hitting the water with pectoral fins or flukes.|$|E
5|$|Not every {{transitional}} form {{appears in}} the fossil record, because the fossil record is not complete. Organisms are <b>only</b> <b>rarely</b> preserved as fossils {{in the best of}} circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered. Paleontologist Donald Prothero noted that this is illustrated {{by the fact that the}} number of species known through the fossil record was less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived.|$|E

5|$|Reflecting Archaeoastronomy's {{development}} as an interdisciplinary subject, {{research in the}} field is conducted by investigators trained {{in a wide range of}} disciplines. Authors of recent doctoral dissertations have described their work as concerned with the fields of archaeology and cultural anthropology; with various fields of history including the history of specific regions and periods, the history of science and the history of religion; and with the relation of astronomy to art, literature and religion. <b>Only</b> <b>rarely</b> did they describe their work as astronomical, and then only as a secondary category.|$|E
5|$|Some {{intraspecific}} brood parasitism occurs, and {{instances of}} unusually {{large numbers of}} eggs in a nest {{may be the result}} of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours. Such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females. The house sparrow is a victim of interspecific brood parasites, but <b>only</b> <b>rarely,</b> since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter, and it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites. In turn, the house sparrow has once been recorded as a brood parasite of the American cliff swallow.|$|E
5|$|The Sirex {{woodwasp}} and Amylostereum areolatum have a mutualistic symbiotic relationship. The Sirex woodwasp is, {{together with}} Sirex juvencus and S. nitobei from eastern Asia, {{one of three}} symbionts of the fungus {{that in the first}} instance benefits from its vector function. Additionally, the wasp creates the optimal conditions for the infestation through the fungus by drilling into the underlying wood layers and weakening the host tree. The fungus adapted to this process {{in the course of the}} years and has created fruit bodies <b>only</b> <b>rarely</b> or in the crop.|$|E
