25|$|The {{exception}} is at Cook Strait where the tidal currents periodically link high to low water.

25|$|When {{two or more}} {{antennae}} {{are placed}} close together, differences in position of the antennae cause the received radio signal {{to be seen as}} differences in phase. For instance, if the two antennae are positioned ½ a wavelength apart, a signal approaching along the line between them will have the <b>opposite</b> <b>phase</b> in the two antennae, causing opposite voltages to be induced.

500|$|For every {{reflection}} {{corresponding to}} a point q in the reciprocal space, there is another reflection of the same intensity at the opposite point -q. This opposite reflection {{is known as the}} Friedel mate of the original reflection. This symmetry results from the mathematical fact that the density of electrons f(r) at a position r is always a real number. As noted above, f(r) is the inverse transform of its Fourier transform F(q); however, such an inverse transform is a complex number in general. To ensure that f(r) is real, the Fourier transform F(q) must be such that the Friedel mates F(−q) and F(q) are complex conjugates of one another. Thus, F(−q) has the same magnitude as F(q) but they have the <b>opposite</b> <b>phase,</b> i.e., φ(q) = −φ(q) ...|$|E

2500|$|Negative {{feedback}} {{feeds the}} difference of the input {{and part of the}} output back to the input in a way that cancels out part of the input. The main effect is to reduce the overall gain of the system. However, the unwanted signals introduced by the amplifier are also fed back.

60|$|Elevation and Depression of the Snow Line as Aiding the Migration of Plants.--We have endeavoured to show (in {{an earlier}} {{portion of this}} volume) that {{wherever}} geographical or physical conditions were such as to produce any considerable amount of perpetual snow, this would be increased whenever {{a high degree of}} excentricity concurred with winter in aphelion, and diminished during the <b>opposite</b> <b>phase.</b> On all mountain ranges, therefore, which reached above the snow-line, there would be a periodical increase and decrease of snow, and when there were extensive areas of plateau at about the same level, the lowering of the snow-line might cause such an increased accumulation of snow as to produce great glaciers and ice-fields, such as we have seen occurred in South Africa during the last period of high excentricity. But along with such depression of the line of perpetual snow there would be a corresponding depression of the alpine and sub-alpine zones suitable for the growth of an arctic and temperate vegetation, and, what is perhaps more important, the depression would necessarily produce a great extension of the area of these zones on all high mountains, because as we descend the average slopes become less abrupt,--thus affording a number of new stations suitable for such temperate plants as might first reach them. But just above and below the snow-line is the area of most powerful disintegration and denudation, from the alternate action of frost and sun, of ice and water; and thus the more extended area would be subject to the constant occurrence of land-slips, berg-falls, and floods, with their {517} accompanying accumulations of débris and of alluvial soil, affording innumerable stations in which solitary wind-borne seeds might germinate and temporarily establish themselves.|$|E

6000|$|... [56] Dr. Croll {{says that}} I here assume an {{impossible}} state of things. He maintains [...] "that {{the change from}} the distant sun in winter, and near sun in summer to the near sun in winter and distant sun in summer, aided by {{the change in the}} physical causes which this would necessarily bring about, would certainly be sufficient to cause the snow and ice to disappear." [...] (Climate and Cosmology, p. 106.) But I demur to his [...] "necessarily." [...] It is not the direct effect of the nearer sun in winter that is supposed to melt the snow and ice, but the [...] "physical causes," [...] such as absence of fogs and increase of warm equatorial currents. But the near sun in winter acting on an ice-clad surface would only increase the fogs and snow, while the currents could only change if {{a large portion of the}} ice were first melted, in which case they would no doubt be modified so as to cause a further melting of the ice. Dr. Croll says: [...] "The warm and equable conditions of climate which would then prevail, and the enormous quantity of intertropical water carried into the Southern Ocean, would soon produce a melting of the ice." [...] (Loc. cit. p. 111.) This seems to me to be assuming the very point at issue. He has himself shown that the presence of large quantities of ice prevents [...] "a warm and equable climate" [...] however great may be the sun-heat; the ice therefore would not be melted, and there would be no increased flow of intertropical water to the Southern Ocean. The ocean currents are mainly due to the difference of temperature of the polar and equatorial areas combined with the peculiar form and position of the continents, and some one or more of these factors must be altered before the ocean currents towards the north pole can be increased. The only factor available is the Antarctic ice, and if this were largely increased, the northward-flowing currents might be so increased as to melt some of the Arctic ice. But the very same argument applies to both poles. Without some geographical change the Antarctic ice could not materially diminish during its winter in perihelion, nor increase to any important extent during the <b>opposite</b> <b>phase.</b> We therefore seem to have no available agency by which to get rid of the ice over a glaciated hemisphere, so long as the geographical conditions remained unchanged and the excentricity continued high.|$|E
