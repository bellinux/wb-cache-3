40|$|Background: Evaluating {{the quality}} of {{postgraduate}} medical education (PGME) programs through accreditation is common practice worldwide. Accreditation is shaped by educational quality and quality management. An appropriate accreditation design is important, as it may drive improvements in training. Moreover, accreditors determine whether a PGME program passes the assessment, which may have major consequences, such as starting, continuing or discontinuing PGME. However, there is limited evidence for the benefits of different choices in accreditation design. Therefore, this study aims to explain how changing views on educational quality and quality management have impacted {{the design of the}} PGME accreditation system in the Netherlands. Methods: To determine the historical development of the Dutch PGME accreditation system, we conducted a document analysis of accreditation documents spanning the past 50 years and a vision document outlining the future system. A template analysis technique was used to identify the main elements of the system. Results: Four themes in the Dutch PGME accreditation system were identified: (1) <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>accreditation,</b> (2) PGME quality domains, (3) quality management approaches and (4) actors' responsibilities. Major shifts have taken place regarding decentralization, residency performance and physician practice outcomes, and quality improvement. Decentralization of the responsibilities of the accreditor was absent in 1966, but this has been slowly changing since 1999. In the future system, there will be nearly a maximum degree of decentralization. A focus on outcomes and quality improvement has been introduced in the current system. The number of formal documents striving for quality assurance has increased enormously over the past 50 years, which has led to increased bureaucracy. The future system needs to decrease the number of standards to focus on measurable outcomes and to strive for quality improvement. Conclusion: The challenge for accreditors is to find the right balance between trusting and controlling medical professionals. Their choices will be reflected in the accreditation design. The four themes could enhance international comparisons and encourage better choices in the design of accreditation system...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} accreditation, types, status and ethical considerations in Library and Information Science, with reference to other professions as a model to adopt. Design/Methodology/Approach: The paper began by defining the concept of accreditation, objectives and types. It went further to discuss issues and status of accreditation with disciplines in Nigeria, Lessons from other disciplines in connection with there professional standards. It finally enjoined the Nigeria Library Association (NLA) and Librarian Registration Council of Nigeria (LRCN) to borrow a leaf from other developed countries to help ensure standards in the profession. Findings: from the paper accreditation {{is said to be}} a process by which institutions or programmes continuously update their educational standard through evaluation programme and institutional accreditation are the two types we have, some of the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> are: to stimulate and integrate the efforts of institutions to evaluate the standards of education; to strengthen the capabilities of the educational institutions for service to the nation; and to identify educational institutions that meets stated criteria for academic quality. In Nigeria, the National University Commission (NUC) is responsible for the accreditation of Library and Information Science (LIS) Schools, unlike in United Kingdom (UK) United State of America (USA) and Australia where professional bodies are chiefly responsible for the accreditation of LIS Schools. Other professional bodies in Nigeria like Nigeria Institution of Architecture, the Council of Legal Education, the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria and Chartered Accountants of Nigeria participate actively in the accreditation of their professions. It is therefore suggested that NLA and LRCN should live up to their responsibility by participating in the accreditation exercise of LIS Schools, provide parameter for recognition of the degrees and empower librarians and LIS Schools with adequate skills and competence to compete globally. Practical Implication: The NUC should incorporate NLA and LRCN to implement the stipulated standards for accreditation of LIS Schools. Originality: Its originality is in the writers’ analysis of accreditation issues in LIS Schools in Nigerian Universities, as against what is done in some other countries vis-à-vis other professions NLA, LIS School, NUC and LRCN have much lessons and information to gain from the work...|$|E

30|$|Although the NCAC was {{determining}} {{decisions on}} the <b>Accreditation</b> status <b>of</b> childcare services since 1993 {{it was not until}} 1997 that the federal government approved the establishment of a process, under the Child Care Act 1972 – 1973, PART V — ADVISORY COMMITTEES, s 16 being, the Accreditations Decisions Review Committee (ADRC). With such a process in place, services who considered an unjust/unfair assessment of their practices had been made and the ensuing Accreditation Decision made by NCAC not reflective of the services practices, now had the right to be heard. From ADRC’s creation in 1997 until 1998, this important review committee was located within the accrediting body (NCAC) as a separate committee with recommendatory powers. However, it became clear that if a review committee was to provide an <b>objective</b> review <b>of</b> <b>Accreditation</b> Decisions <b>of</b> NCAC and promote fairness and equity in the administration of the child care quality assurance system, it needed to be a separate and independent body. Consequently, in 1998 the commonwealth government revised the Terms of Reference of ADRC to provide ADRC the status of an independent review committee with recommendatory powers. As with recommendatory powers (Douglas, 2006), ADRC could not bind the decision making body (NCAC) to reconsider its accreditation decision in the light of its recommendations. The right to determinative decision-making powers, like the powers provided to the review process in the Council <b>of</b> <b>Accreditation</b> for Children and Families (COA) in US (Frisino, 2002), still eluded ADRC.|$|R

40|$|Quality Assurance {{has become}} one of the prime factors for {{consideration}} by a customer whether a person or organisation in order to achieve highly competitive industrial activity. Within the developing countries there is limited awareness among the public regarding the role and purpose <b>of</b> <b>accreditation.</b> This constitutes a major constraint and it is one of several constraints for accreditation, specifically, in the Arab region. The primary <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> a National <b>Accreditation</b> Body is to enable organisations to attain continuous performance improvement, maintain consistency, promote quality awareness and achieve the desired level of business excellence. However, a major issue arises as to the application of the NABs in different cultural and operational backgrounds, and how to take account of additional complexities of social systems. Therefore accreditation in the developing countries need to establish a new strategy on accreditation to be able to demonstrate the capability to compete internationally taking account of the difficulties, barriers, confidence and international acceptance. The research was carried out in three phases. Phase one established a conceptual framework based on a literature review and a quantitative and qualitative study. It described seven important themes containing 94 variables as critical to a sustainable accreditation scheme. Phase two provided empirical studies of the Quality Assurance approaches adopted in a case study in Tunisia. The field research surveyed the selected samples from the Tunisian Accreditation Council (TUNAC) and Central Laboratories for Testing and Analyses’(LCAE) population using a questionnaire.

Methods The paper is based on an exploratory research which has used qualitative methods, including snowball sampling technique, email interview and thematic content analysis. Participants Respondents (experts and professionals) were selected from a diverse spectrum ranging from healthcare organizations, universities and accreditation-associated institutions. Results The analysis of the data provided key measures to be considered in the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> programs' impact at macro and micro levels as well as their nature and operations. The measures can be used to, for example, assess the degree of stakeholders' reliance on accreditation results, measure the cost <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> for participating organizations and serve as a formal mechanism for accredited organizations to appeal accreditation decisions.

40|$|Background: Accreditation {{has become}} {{ubiquitous}} across the international health care landscape. Award <b>of</b> full <b>accreditation</b> status {{in health care}} is viewed, {{as it is in}} other sectors, as a valid indicator of high quality organisational performance. However, few studies have empirically demonstrated this assertion. The value <b>of</b> <b>accreditation,</b> therefore, remains uncertain, and this persists as a central legitimacy problem for accreditation providers, policymakers and researchers. The question arises as to how best to research the validity, impact and value <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> processes in health care. Most health care organisations participate in some sort <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> process and thus {{it is not possible to}} study its merits using a randomised controlled strategy. Further, tools and processes for accreditation and organisational performance are multifaceted. Methods/design: To understand the relationship between them a multi-method research approach is required which incorporates both quantitative and qualitative data. The generic nature <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> standard development and inspection within different sectors enhances the extent to which the findings of in-depth study <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> process in one industry can be generalised to other industries. This paper presents a research design which comprises a prospective, multi-method, multi-level, multi-disciplinary approach to assess the validity, impact and value <b>of</b> <b>accreditation.</b> Discussion: The accreditation program which assesses over 1, 000 health services in Australia is used as an exemplar for testing this design. The paper proposes this design as a framework suitable for application to future international research into accreditation.
