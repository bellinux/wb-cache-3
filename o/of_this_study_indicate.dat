5000|$|Fathead minnows {{have also}} been found to produce fewer {{epidermal}} alarm substance cells (and therefore less schreckstoff) when {{in the presence of}} familiar shoalmates. [...] The results <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>indicate</b> one of two scenarios, neither of which is compatible with the hypothesis that schreckstoff evolved by kin selection. First, if schreckstoff evolved by kin selection, more epidermal alarm substance cells would be expected to be produced in the presence of kin than nonkin. This means familiar shoalmates in fathead minnows should be closely related kin and schreckstoff production should be increased when in shoals with familiar individuals. The study did not find this to be the case. [...] Second, these results indicate individuals either do not associate with kin at all or production of schreckstoff varies depending on how familiar the focal fish is with the individuals with which it shoals. In conclusion, evidence does not support the hypothesis that schreckstoff evolved because it bolstered the inclusive fitness of the sender through increased survival of kin.|$|E

5000|$|The results <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>indicate</b> that {{attention}} to threat (attention given, by the toddler to the feared stimuli) predicts social inhibition in kindergarten. Further, {{if the child}} approaches the feared stimuli, the relation to later social inhibition is not significant. When a child's behavior is to keep more than two {{feet away from the}} threatening stimulus, their behavior can be seen as linked to later social inhibition. Another important factor that the researchers found when looking at the prediction of social inhibition is the child paying a significant amount of attention to a feared or threatening stimuli in the presence of other, enjoyable activities. Mainly, if the child's duration of attention to the threatening stimuli is significant even when there are other enjoyable activities available for them to interact with, the link to later social inhibition is stronger {{due to the fact that}} [...] "toddler-aged children have increased motoric skill and independence in exploring their environments; so they are capable of using more sophisticated distraction techniques, such as involvement with other activities" [...] (Kopp, 1982 PG 199).|$|E
5000|$|Research {{has shown}} that mothers of infants who have Kewpie doll-like {{appearances}} show more affection, play more often with, and spend more time engaged with their baby than mothers of less attractive babies, despite the common belief that parents will treat their child the same, regardless of appearance. Psychologists compared the mother-infant interactions of three-month-old babies with craniofacial abnormalities and normal infants and observed that the mothers of the infants with abnormalities engaged their baby with smiles less often than the mothers of normal babies, spoke to their infants less, and were less responsive to their infants than were the mothers of the normal infants. The results <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>indicate</b> that the appearance, attractiveness, and facial configuration of an infant is a strong predictor of maternal affection and behavior toward the child. Recent research {{has shown that}} the phenomenon of decreased responsiveness and attention was not limited to infants with mild to severe head and face deformities. Families of low socioeconomic status with healthy newborn infants were selected to participate. Photos of their newborns were rated on attractiveness by a panel of university students. Researchers observed mother-infant interactions and recorded the [...] "affectionate interaction" [...] between the baby and mother (how often the mother kissed, smiled at, cuddled, held the baby), {{the amount of time spent}} on [...] "routine care-giving" [...] (fed, changed, cleaned up after the baby), and how often the mothers [...] "attended to others" [...] while with the baby. The researchers compared attractive and unattractive babies and showed that the mothers of more attractive infants had more affectionate interactions with their infants than the mothers of less attractive infants while the mothers of unattractive infants spent more time on routine care-giving and attended to others more often. The researchers believe they have established a relationship between the attractiveness of an infant and his or her treatment by the caregiver for normal children of different attractiveness.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{influence}} of Kohlberg, his views did not come without criticism and critique. Previous moral development scales, particularly Kohlberg's, believe that moral reasoning is dominated by one main perspective: justice. However, Gilligan and Attanucci {{argue that there is}} an alternative to this approach known as the care perspective. The justice view deals with problems of inequality and oppression with equal rights and respect for all, whereas the care perspective deals with attachment to others. Both are unique experiences found within human development and experiences. Gilligan and Attanucci analyzed male and female responses to moral situations using content analysis to identify their moral considerations. Overall the study found that a majority of participants do represent both care and justice in their moral orientations. In addition, they found that men do tend to use the justice view significantly more than women and the same for women towards the care perspective. This is significant as it illustrates that females were prone to view moral situations is a way that previous research did not account for and overlooked. At the time of production, this study really opened multiple closed doors leading to answers and further understanding of what separates men and women, specifically with how they handle and act upon moral situations. Solely looking at justice when determining moral development may not be appropriate for both genders. The results <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>indicate</b> that one's moral standpoint—justice or caring—may be an extension of one's identity or preferred perception of life. This is especially true when a decision is made introspectively, or at the [...] "postconventional" [...] level. While this article from Gilligan and Attanucci did need a broader spectrum of test subjects to really prove authenticity, {{it is important to remember}} that not everyone views morality the same. In fact, Gilligan and Attanucci stated that different viewpoints on morality may be beneficial. It is possible to expand moral understanding if we acknowledge others' moral perspectives. Reviews by Walker (2006) and Jaffee and Hyde (2001) found that Gilligan's theory was not supported by empirical studies. In fact, in neo-Kohlbergian studies with the Defining Issues Test, females tend to get higher scores than males, though generally not significantly so (Rest, Narvaez, Bebeau & Thoma, 1999).|$|E
