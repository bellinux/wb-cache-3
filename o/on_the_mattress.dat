The defence team implied that DNA samples may have been taken from Anwar, while unconscious, after his beating in police custody, to create false forensics evidence to frame Anwar; however, High Court Judge Augustine Paul accepted that DNA evidence.|$|E

The video commences with Cyrus asleep, blindfolded on a mattress in a bedroom. She awakens and writhes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mattress.</b> Following, Cyrus proceeds to a bathroom, her attire is composed of a white tank top, white boy shorts, a fishnet hair wrap, rollers, and heavy metal jewelry. While in the bathroom scenes, Cyrus sings as {{she sits on the}} edge of a bathtub and prepares herself for an upcoming party. With the arrival of the song's refrains, Cyrus appears writhing in the backseat of a limousine, costumed in a low-cut gold halter top, black hots pants, a black jacket with shoulder pads, and big hair. Once arrived at the mansion party, she is first seen dancing atop a big, wooden table. In the continuation of the video, Cyrus dances with multiple people on the dance floor. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus in all prior scenes or dancing with others in the mansion's study. The video concludes with Cyrus back in her bedroom, once again waking up.|$|E

500|$|Investigating {{events at}} Metropolis, Jonathan deduces that Gessler's {{grandfather}} was a Nazi sympathizer, who laid a trap in the attic room to kill one of his enemies without arousing suspicion. Jonathan and Joey {{spend the night in}} the room, but uncover nothing, save for a small vent in the canopy of the room's four-poster bed, which is opened when pressure is put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mattress,</b> releasing dead flies. The next morning, Jonathan comes to the realization that the vent above the bed was designed to leak a [...] fluid onto the room's occupants as they slept, meaning they would need to bathe in the adjoining bathroom. Upon realizing the secret behind the disappearances, Jonathan races back up to the attic with Glenn. Unfortunately, Joey had already climbed into the bath, which has descended and released her into a water tank below the room, where the corpses of previous victims (including her friend Mina) remain, drowned and decomposing. The bath has not yet returned to its position so Jonathan and Glenn are able to rescue her. The mystery resembles the real-life case of the Jarmans, the sixteenth-century owners of the Ostrich Inn in Slough (Berkshire), who killed wealthy travelers by tipping them into a barrel of boiling water via a hinged bed in one of the bedrooms.|$|E
500|$|The video commences with Drew asking Swift, [...] "Hey, are you gonna go to {{the game}} on Friday?" [...] Swift responds, [...] "Well, I was {{thinking}} about it. Why?" [...] He then admits it was just curiosity, informs Swift about a girl he met, and walks away. The video then transcends to Swift, wearing a long aquamarine evening gown, lying beside an acoustic guitar on a mattress in a bedroom. She performs the song until the scene transitions to Swift and Drew at the library, where he parodies a novel and she chuckles. The librarian requests for the two to maintain silence, so they converse quietly. Afterwards, Swift is in a chemistry laboratory, where she is mixing substances. Distracted by Drew approaching her, she accidentally pours too much of one substance and causes it to spill. They both rapidly attempt to clean the mess generated. As the song approaches its bridge, Swift and Drew walk towards each other, both smiling, but Drew then kisses his girlfriend, as Swift watches in agony. The video again transcends to the performance scene, where it concludes. Cut-scenes feature Swift lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mattress,</b> crying, and standing beside a fireplace in the bedroom. The video received a nomination for [...] "Number One Streamed Music Video" [...] at the web-hosted 2007 CMT Online Awards, but lost to Sugarland's [...] "Stay" [...] (2007).

2500|$|Giving {{the album}} {{a rating of}} 7/10, Ben Detrick of Spin stated that [...] "Lloyd Banks' hunger is not born of starvation, but of an insatiable appetite. On his third solo effort, the G-Unit rapper is a {{connoisseur}} of cars, women, and guns, spinning tight spider webs of syllables that are often so patterned that they obscure individual strands. [...] "Put my Ferrari in park, give 'em a running start," [...] Banks growls on [...] "Payback," [...] a sinister track with mentor 50 Cent and a woozy, almost dubstep bass line. But he loves the ladies {{almost as much as}} barking threats. On [...] "So Forgetful," [...] an apology to past conquests, Banks muses about [...] "wet spots <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> and champagne splashes" [...] atop producer Ryan Leslie's 8-bit Atari synths." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today was also positive about the album, giving the album 3/4 stars and citing that [...] "the G-Unit rapper seeks to rekindle the spark of his critically acclaimed 2004 platinum debut by recalling both the title and the potent street vibe. Banks enlists several like-minded rappers — Pusha T, Styles P, Juelz Santana and Raekwon— who complement his own grittiness. The same goes for R stars Akon and Lloyd as he relies mainly on his signature jaw-breaking punch lines while eschewing a rash of poppish hooks. Banks is well served by his refusal to compromise just for airplay. His Hunger should whet his fans' appetites for even more." ...|$|E

40|$|In hospitals, one of {{the ways}} to control {{microbial}} contamination is by disinfecting the furniture used by patients. This study's main objective was to evaluate the microbiological condition of hospital mattresses before and after such disinfection, in order to identify bacteria that are epidemiologically important in nosocomial infection, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RODAC plates with two different culture media were used to collect specimens. Patient beds were selected according to previously established criteria, and surface areas <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mattresses</b> were chosen at random. From the total of 1 040 plate cultures from 52 mattresses, positive results were obtained from 500 of them (48. 1 %), 263 before disinfection and 237 after disinfection. Considering the selectivity of the culture media, the positivity rate was high. There were high prevalences of S. aureus both before and after <b>mattress</b> disinfection. <b>The</b> study results suggest that the usual disinfection procedures, instead of diminishing the number of microbes, merely displace them from one part of <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> to another, and the number of microorganisms remains the same...|$|R

40|$|Current {{immobilization}} {{techniques of the}} cervical spine are associated with complications including pressure ulcers, discomfort, and elevated intracranial pressures with limited access to the thorax and airway. In this study, a newly developed craniothoracic immobilizer (Pharaoh mattress) for critical care patients with cervical injury was tested for its restriction of cervical movement, peak interface pressures, comfort, and radiolucency, and compared with headblocks strapped to a spineboard. Cervical movement was measured by roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis in 5 fresh frozen cadavers. Peak interface and discomfort pressures were measured in 10 healthy volunteers. Radiographic absorption was calculated by measuring the total emission radiation with and without immobilizer. <b>The</b> Pharaoh <b>mattress</b> caused a mean restriction of 59 % (SD: 15) flexion-extension, 77 % (SD: 14) lateral bending, and 93 % (SD: 3) rotation, compared with the unrestricted situation. No significant differences in restriction of cervical movement were found between headblocks strapped to a spineboard and <b>the</b> Pharaoh <b>mattress.</b> <b>The</b> mean peak pressures <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Pharaoh <b>mattress</b> were significantly lower than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spineboard. Healthy volunteers gave significantly lower numeric discomfort scores <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Pharaoh <b>mattress</b> than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spineboard. <b>The</b> Pharaoh <b>mattress</b> absorbed more x-rays than the spineboard. <b>The</b> Pharaoh <b>mattress</b> provides similar restriction of cervical movement compared with headblocks strapped to a spineboard but with lower interface pressures and increased comfort.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Exposure to allergens {{plays a role}} in the {{development}} of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and in the chronic inflammatory response seen in asthmatic patients. House dust mites (HDMs) are an important source of allergen. Reduction of these allergens might lead to better lung function and reduction of asthma symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The effect of HDM-impermeable covers on HDM allergen levels, peak flow values, and asthma symptoms were measured. Therefore a randomized clinical trial was carried out. METHODS: Fifty-two allergic asthmatic patients were randomly allocated to use the HDM-impermeable or placebo covers. During the study period, daily peak flow and asthma symptom scores were recorded. Dust samples were taken from <b>the</b> <b>mattresses.</b> RESULTS: We observed a significant reduction in HDM allergen levels <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mattresses</b> after encasing them with HDM-impermeable covers (reduction of 87 % of Der p 1 in micrograms per gram of dust; P <. 001). Baseline symptoms were so low that no improvement could be established. Morning peak expiratory flow is significantly higher in the intervention group compared with that seen in the placebo group during the study period (beta= 20. 2; P <. 01). CONCLUSIONS: HDM-impermeable covers significantly decreased the level of HDM allergens. Furthermore, morning peak flow was significantly increased during the intervention period. This study indicates that HDM allergen-avoidance measures might have beneficial effects on allergen reduction and asthma outcome...|$|R
