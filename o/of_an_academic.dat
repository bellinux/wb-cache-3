5|$|Colleges {{arrange the}} {{tutorial}} teaching for their undergraduates, {{and the members}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>academic</b> department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library {{for the use of}} its members).|$|E
5|$|The first {{historian}} to make {{an academic}} estimate of the death toll of the Nanking Massacre was Tomio Hora in his 1967 book Kindai Senshi no Nazo ("Riddles of Modern War History"), who argued in favor of 200,000. Since then the death toll of the massacre {{has been a major}} topic of discussion among historians across the world.

5|$|Both {{women are}} {{reported}} to have had many paranormal experiences before and after their adventure. In one of them, Moberly claimed to {{have seen in the}} Louvre in 1914 an apparition of the Roman emperor Constantine, a man of unusual height wearing a gold crown and a toga; he was not observed by anybody else. During the First World War, Jourdain, the dominant personality of the pair who had succeeded as Principal of St. Hugh's, became convinced that a German spy was hiding in the college. After developing increasingly autocratic behaviour, she died suddenly in 1924 in the middle <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>academic</b> scandal over her leadership of the college, her conduct having provoked mass resignations of academic staff. Moberly died in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Now that orca {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} for several decades, the exact age of many younger whales is known. The age of older orcas, such as Granny, is estimated by their offspring; they give birth around age 15, and stop having offspring around 40; by adding the generations together, ages can be estimated. Granny was photographed in 1971 with a male orca, J1 Ruffles, who was believed at the time to be her son. Ruffles was estimated as at least 20 years old, and as scientists believed him to be Granny's last offspring, her own age was estimated at about 60. It was later discovered that Ruffles was not Granny's son, but her age estimate was never changed. Granny's age was originally estimated with a margin of error of 12 years, but was the subject <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>academic</b> dispute in 2016 due to her original age being based on evidence now known to be incorrect, as well as a large disparity between the life expectancy of orcas with estimated ages and orcas with known ages. Analysis of fatty acids from a recent biopsy of Granny indicated that Granny may have only been 65-80 years of age.|$|E
