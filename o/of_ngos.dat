As of 2013, the average home had 1.9 rooms, and only 14.9% of buildings in the province had permanent roofs, walls, and flooring. Relatively few households (27.8%) had toilet facilities. The largest share of households (38.0%) obtained water from springs, streams, ponds, or rain; much of the remainder obtained water from protected (23.9%) or unprotected (15.1%) dug wells. Only 21.6% of Ratanakiri residents obtained water from sources that are considered safe (purchased water, piped water, or tube/piped wells). Household water sources were within the home for 28.0% of households, near the home for 39.1%, and away from the home for 32.9%. The most common source of light was battery power (39.5%), followed by government-provided power (25.5%), and kerosene (16.5%). Most households (85%) used firewood as the main fuel for cooking. A variety <b>of</b> <b>NGOs,</b> including Oxfam and Health Unlimited, work to improve health and living conditions in the province.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{presence}} and influence <b>of</b> nongovernmental organizations (<b>NGOs)</b> {{in the landscape}} of global health and development have dramatically increased {{over the past several}} decades. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>NGO</b> activity {{and the ways in which}} contextual factors influence the distribution <b>of</b> <b>NGO</b> activity across geographies merit study. This paper explores the distribution <b>of</b> <b>NGO</b> activity, using Bolivia as a case study, and identifies local factors that are related to the distribution <b>of</b> <b>NGO</b> activity across municipalities in Bolivia. Methods The research question is addressed using a geographic information system (GIS) and multiple regression analyses of count data. We used count data of the total number <b>of</b> <b>NGO</b> projects across Bolivian municipalities to measure NGO activity both in general and in the health sector specifically and national census data for explanatory variables of interest. Results This study provides one of the first empirical analyses exploring factors related to the distribution <b>of</b> <b>NGO</b> activity at the national scale. Our analyses show that NGO activity in Bolivia, both in general and health-sector specific, is distributed unevenly across the country. Results indicate that NGO activity is related to population size, extent of urbanization, size of the indigenous population, and health system coverage. Results for NGO activity in general and health-sector specific NGO activity were similar. Conclusions The uneven distribution <b>of</b> <b>NGO</b> activity may suggest a lack <b>of</b> co-ordination among <b>NGOs</b> working in Bolivia as well as a lack <b>of</b> co-ordination among <b>NGO</b> funders. Co-ordination <b>of</b> <b>NGO</b> activity is most needed in regions characterized by high NGO activity in order to avoid duplication of services and programmes and inefficient use of limited resources. Our findings also indicate that neither general nor health specific NGO activity is related to population need, when defined as population health status or education level or poverty levels. Considering these results we discuss broader implications for global health and development and make several recommendations relevant for development and health practice and research. </p...|$|R

Many of the larger domestic groups are actually government funded, and those not affiliated with the government are required {{to go through a}} complicated registration procedure to be officially endorsed, although there might be a relaxation of these policies in the future. The presence of international NGOs is also increasing. The ability <b>of</b> <b>NGOs</b> to work with high-risk groups, especially those that engage in behaviors deemed to be illegal or immoral, and to provide care and outreach where overstretched health services cannot, is recognized. The private sector is also being encouraged to undertake prevention and education activities.|$|E

30|$|As control, we next {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} this reduction method on both nGO and nGO-COOH solutions. In brief, nGO and nGO-COOH solutions were bathed at 90 °C for 24  h. UV-vis spectra showed that nGO and nGO-COOH had approximately 3.1 and approximately 3.4 -fold increment in NIR absorbance (at 808  nm) (Figure  2 D), which was further verified by the color change (darkening) <b>of</b> <b>nGO</b> and nGO-COOH solutions (Figure  2 D inset). After reduction, the absorption peak (230  nm) <b>of</b> <b>nGO</b> and nGO-COOH red-shifted to approximately 238  nm and the shoulder peak (300  nm) nearly disappeared (Figure  2 D). As shown in Figure  2 A,D, carboxylation <b>of</b> <b>nGO</b> and carboxyl group did not affect the reduction extent <b>of</b> <b>nGO.</b> Although nGO and nGO-COOH could be reduced by this green reduction method (Figure  2 D), the reduced nGO and nGO-COOH showed intense aggregations and relative low NIR absorbance (Figure  2 B,C,D inset), indicating that the endogenous PEG chains of nGO-PEG remarkably strengthened the reduction extent <b>of</b> <b>nGO</b> during this facile and green reduction process.|$|R

The hundreds <b>of</b> <b>NGOs</b> throughout Brazil produce documents containing both useful information and passionate criticisms. Among the Brazilian environmental NGOs, the most visible are SOS Atlantic Forest (SOS Mata Atlântica), the Social-Environmental Institute (Instituto Sócio-Ambiental—ISA), the Pro-Nature Foundation (Fundação Pró-Natureza—Funatura), and the Amazon Working Group (Grupo de Trabalho Amazônico—GTA). The Brazilian Forum <b>of</b> <b>NGOs</b> and Social Movements for the Environment and Development and the Brazilian Association of Nongovernmental Organizations (Associacão Brasileira de Organizações Não-Governamentais—ABONG) are national networks, and there are various regional and thematic networks as well.

This thesis investigates how these NGO's theoretically realize the functions <b>of</b> <b>NGO's</b> through these activities and with what functions are the certain activities connected. The important element is to describe and categorize the non-service activities and explain how they were realized, why they were realized and if they are important for the head of these organizations.

As early as the Summer of 2002, there was great concern amongst the leaders of Georgia's most influential NGOs that Shevardnadze was not prepared to relinquish power voluntarily, and that other ways to remove him from power might be necessary. Some of these leaders hoped to make the 'Serbian scenario' a reality in Georgia, in the sense that they wanted to promote non-violent protests to force the resignation of an authoritarian leader. Before the Rose Revolution, a large network <b>of</b> <b>NGOs</b> with foreign financial support already existed in the country that could later coordinate protest.|$|E
