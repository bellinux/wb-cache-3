5|$|Franklin's {{electrostatic}} {{machine is}} a high-voltage static electricity generating device used by Benjamin Franklin in the mid-eighteenth century for research into electrical phenomena. Its key components are a glass globe which turned on an axis via a crank; a cloth pad {{in contact with}} the spinning globe; a set of metal needles to conduct away the charge developed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>globe</b> by its friction with the pad; and a Leyden jara high-voltage capacitorto accumulate the charge. Franklin's experiments with the machine eventually led to new theories about electricity and inventing the lightning rod.|$|E

5|$|In {{the present}} day, Tintin, his dog Snowy, {{and his friends}} Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus follow {{coordinates}} that Sir Francis had left his three sons in a strange riddle hidden in three model ships of the Unicorn. Reaching the coordinates, they discover the island and, upon diving, they find {{the wreck of the}} Unicorn. Although they recover various artefacts from it, they do not find the treasure. Back in Belgium, Tintin realises that Sir Francis' message referred, not to the location of the Unicorn, but to a globe mounted on a statue in Sir Francis' former country home. Understanding now that Francis would never have left the treasure but would have taken it with him to his home, Tintin locates the coordinates to the treasure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>globe,</b> presses a secret button he finds there, and discovers Red Rackham's treasure hidden inside.|$|E

5|$|The {{lectures and}} book had been {{originally}} scheduled for 2009, but were {{moved up to}} 2008 to avoid conflicting with Atwood's forthcoming novel after the latter book was delayed by its publisher. The content examines borrowing and lending from financial, psychological, theological, literary, and ecological points of view. Its release coincided with extensive {{media coverage of the}} recent financial crisis which led numerous critics to comment on the book's timeliness. In the Canadian market, the book peaked at #1 <b>on</b> <b>The</b> <b>Globe</b> and Mail bestseller list on October 25 and out-sold all previous Massey Lecture books. Critics found the book well-researched, thought-provoking, and humorous. Various reviewers found the discussions on the non-monetary aspects of debt to be the better parts of the book, while some critics identified the sections on ecological debt as the worse parts of the book.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} for generating solar {{energy from the}} Sahara Desert is huge, the highest found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>globe.</b> Professor David Faiman of Ben-Gurion University has stated that the technology now exists to supply all of the world's electricity needs from 10% of the Sahara Desert. Desertec Industrial Initiative was a consortium seeking $560 billion to invest in North African solar and wind installations over the next forty years to supply electricity to Europe via cable lines running under the Mediterranean Sea. European interest in the Sahara Desert stems from its two aspects: the almost continual daytime sunshine and plenty of unused land. The Sahara receives more sunshine per acre than any part of Europe. The Sahara Desert also has the empty space totalling hundreds of square miles required to house fields of mirrors for solar plants.|$|E

5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where you are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>globe.</b> Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth {{would be unable to}} see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E
