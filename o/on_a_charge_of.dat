In 1964 Stephenson achieved national fame when he refused to leave a public house until he was served, resulting in a trial <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> failing to leave a licensed premises.

5|$|In 1885 Piłsudski started medical {{studies at}} Kharkov University (now Kharkiv, Ukraine), {{where he became}} {{involved}} with Narodnaya Volya, part of the Russian Narodniki revolutionary movement. In 1886, he was suspended for participating in student demonstrations. He {{was rejected by the}} University of Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia), whose authorities had been informed of his political affiliation. On 22 March 1887, he was arrested by Tsarist authorities <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> plotting with Vilnius socialists to assassinate Tsar Alexander III. In fact, Piłsudski's main connection to the plot was his elder brother Bronisław's involvement in it. Bronisław Piłsudski was sentenced to fifteen years' hard labor (katorga) in eastern Siberia.|$|E
5|$|Following Buckingham’s {{death in}} 1628, {{when it was}} safer to do so, a {{translation}} of a history by Pierre Matthieu was published under the title, The Powerful Favourite, the life of Aelius Sejanus. This was followed in 1634 by another translation, Sir Thomas Hawkins' Politicall Observations upon the Fall of Sejanus, which had originally been titled Della peripetia di fortuna (Of Changes of Fortune) by its author, Giovanni Battista Manzini. Later in the century Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, {{was the target of}} the four-page political pamphlet Sejanus, or The popular favourite, now in his solitude, and sufferings, signed with the pseudonym Timothy Tory (1681). The story of Sejanus, with reference to the Earl's imprisonment in the Tower <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> treason, is interpreted as an argument for absolute monarchy, direct rule without the intermediary of politicians.|$|E
5|$|He {{also scored}} the final try {{of the match}} in Wigan's fifth round cup win over Wakefield Trinity, and {{although}} he was found guilty <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> kicking out in the tackle against another player, he escaped a match ban. With Smith expressing his desire to return home to Australia following the 2009 season, Tomkins was tipped by Lenagan as Wigan's long-term replacement at stand-off. Tomkins was named in a train-on squad for England's friendly test match against France, {{although he did not}} play. He was dropped in round 15 for Wigan's match against Salford, but returned off the bench and scored against Hull Kingston Rovers in round 18. Tomkins played every game for Wigan thereafter, except for the final regular round fixture of the season against Huddersfield, until the team were knocked out of the Super League play-offs by St. Helens. Included in this run of appearances was a hat-trick and Tomkins' first drop goal against Castleford in round 25.|$|E

5|$|In January 1837, Smith {{and other}} church leaders created a joint stock company, called the Kirtland Safety Society, {{to act as}} a quasi-bank; the company issued bank notes {{capitalized}} in part by real estate. Smith encouraged the Latter Day Saints to buy the notes, and he invested heavily in them himself, but the bank failed within a month. As a result, the Latter Day Saints in Kirtland suffered intense pressure from debt collectors and severe price volatility. Smith was held responsible for the failure, and there were widespread defections from the church, including many of Smith's closest advisers. After a warrant was issued for Smith's arrest <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> banking fraud, Smith and Rigdon fled Kirtland for Missouri in January 1838.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, 1913, Frank {{was indicted}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> murder {{and the case}} opened at Fulton County Superior Court on July 28. The {{prosecution}} relied heavily on the testimony of Conley, who described himself as an accomplice to the murder, and who the defense at the trial argued {{was in fact the}} perpetrator of the murder. A guilty verdict was announced on August 25. Frank and his lawyers made a series of unsuccessful appeals; their final appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States failed in April 1915. Considering arguments from both sides as well as evidence not available at trial, Governor John M. Slaton commuted Frank's sentence from capital punishment to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|While ashore {{during the}} peace Macnamara {{contrived}} to become {{embroiled in a}} duel. While walking his Newfoundland dog in Hyde Park on 6 April 1803 he had an altercation with Colonel Robert Montgomery, when their dogs began fighting. Harsh words were exchanged, and the two parties fought a duel that evening at Chalk Farm. Both men were wounded, the colonel mortally. Macnamara was arrested <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> manslaughter and put on trial at the Old Bailey on 22 April. Macnamara defended himself from the charge {{on the grounds that}} he had received an affront and that it was necessary for him to challenge it in order to maintain his position as a naval officer. He summoned many of his naval friends, among whom Viscounts Hood and Nelson, Lord Hotham, Sir Hyde Parker, Sir Thomas Troubridge, Captains Martin, Towry, Lydiard, Moore and Waller; and General Churchill and Lord Minto, to testify in his defence. They supported his assertion that he was the 'reverse of quarrelsome' and the jury took ten minutes to acquit him.|$|E

5|$|While some records such as Christophe Plantin's exist of what exact types {{were cut}} by Garamond himself, many {{details of his}} career remain uncertain: early {{estimates}} placed Garamond’s date of birth 1480, but modern opinion proposes much later estimates. A document called the Le Bé Memorandum (based on the memories of Guillaume Le Bé, but collated {{by one of his}} sons around 1643) suggests that Garamond finished his apprenticeship around 1510. This is considered unlikely by modern historians since his mother was still alive when he died in 1561 and little is known of him before around 1540. It has been suggested that the first Roman types designed by Claude Garamond were a set created for Robert Estienne and first used by him around 1530-3, that were the first typefaces used in Paris to copy the Manutius model. However, Vervliet suggests that these 'Estienne typefaces' were not designed by Garamond and that his career began somewhat later. Vervliet suggests that the creator of this set of typefaces to a unified design may have been a 'Master Constantin', recorded in the Le Bé Memorandum as a master type designer of the period before Garamond but about whom nothing is otherwise known and to whom no obvious other body of work can be ascribed. If so, his disappearance from history (perhaps due to an early death, since all his presumed work appeared in just three years from 1530 to 1533) and the execution of Augereau <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> heresy in 1534 may have allowed Garamond's reputation to develop in the following decade.|$|E
