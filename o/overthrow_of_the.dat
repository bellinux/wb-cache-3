50|$|Bayes {{introduces}} his play, {{and claims}} that it will begin with two men whispering to one another. The egotistical playwright justifies the whispering {{on the grounds that}} they’re politicians and not supposed to talk about matters of state. We later discover the two men are plotting against <b>the</b> two kings <b>of</b> Brentford, and Bayes wants to foreshadow <b>the</b> future <b>overthrowing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kings.|$|R

That was all they could hope to see realized in their lifetime.|$|E

5|$|The abrupt {{abolition}} of slavery which Rio Branco had warned against eventually occurred eight years later.

5|$|As a lawyer, Sawyer {{focused on}} civil {{litigation}} in corporate law, {{at which he}} excelled. He also {{spent much of his}} time in the field of civil liberties, for which he became more well-known but less well-compensated. In 1953, he was one of several defense attorneys in the case of United States v. Kuzma, a prosecution of Communist sympathizers under the Smith Act, which barred anyone from advocating for the <b>overthrow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American government. The defendants were found guilty, but their convictions were reversed in 1957 after the United States Supreme Court overturned the Smith Act in Yates v. United States.|$|E

5|$|Following the pagoda raids, the United States {{terminated}} {{funding to}} Tung's men {{because they were}} used as a political tool rather than against the communists. Along with Diệm and Nhu, Tung was assassinated during the November 1963 coup. Nhu and Tung had been preparing a fake coup and counter-coup {{in order to give}} a false demonstration of the regime's strength. However, the pair were unaware that General Tôn Thất Đính, who was planning the phony operation, was involved in the real coup plot. Đính tricked Tung into sending his men into the countryside, leaving the regime in Saigon without the protection of the special forces. This led to the easy <b>overthrow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regime.|$|E

When the government was overthrown, The United Fruit Company re-established itself in Guatemala. The episodes tainted an otherwise distinguished career and painted Lodge as a face of US imperialism and exceptionalism.|$|R

The film stresses the values associated with nationalism as expressed in <b>the</b> union <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people, the army, and the church in defense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, which was considered by some a prelude to the revolutionary ideology that led to, on June 4, 1943, <b>the</b> <b>overthrowing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government <b>of</b> president Ramón Castillo.|$|R

5|$|In 1925, the Taft Court {{laid the}} groundwork for the {{incorporation}} of many of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights to be applied against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.

Justice Edward T. Sanford wrote the court's opinion, and both majority and minority (Holmes, joined by Brandeis) assumed that the First Amendment's Free Speech and Free Press clauses were protected against infringement by the states.|$|E
5|$|Marochetti {{was born}} in Italy and was ennobled by the Kingdom of Sardinia but {{lived and worked in}} France, {{creating}} a number of prestigious works for the royalist French government in the 1830s.

5|$|Since January 2006, Lal Masjid and the {{adjacent}} Jamia Hafsa madrasah had been operated by Islamic militants led by two brothers, Abdul Aziz and Abdul Rashid.

While then-Sergeant Thomas Quiwonkpa led the plotters, it was the group led by Samuel Doe that found Tolbert in his office, and it was Doe, as a master sergeant the highest ranking of the group, who went on the radio the next day to announce the <b>overthrow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long-entrenched True Whig Party government.|$|E
