50|$|Ditylenchus dipsaci is an plant {{pathogenic}} nematode that primarily infects {{onion and}} garlic. It is {{commonly known as}} the stem nematode, the stem and bulb eelworm, or <b>onion</b> <b>bloat</b> (in the United Kingdom). Symptoms of infection include stunted growth, discoloration of bulbs, and swollen stems. D. dipsaci is a migratory endoparasite that has a five-stage lifecycle and the ability to enter into a dormancy stage. D. dipsaci enters through stomata or plant wounds and creates galls or malformations in plant growth. This allows for the entrance of secondary pathogens such as fungi and bacteria. Management of disease is maintained through seed sanitation, heat treatment, crop rotation, and fumigation of fields. D. dipsaci is economically detrimental because infected crops are unmarketable.|$|E
