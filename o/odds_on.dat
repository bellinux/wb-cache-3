He {{also stated that}} Claudio Chiappucci would likely contend for the overall crown due to his good form coming into the race. According to Paolo Viberti of El País, Bugno came in as the <b>odds</b> <b>on</b> favorite to win the race. Eugenio Capodacqua of La Repubblica and La Stampas Gianni Ranieri believed that the race was going be won by either Chiappucci or Bugno.

5|$|A {{featured}} match {{heading into}} Against All Odds was the debuting of Full Metal Mayhem, in which Abyss fought Jeff Hardy, with the winner becoming number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. In a Full Metal Mayhem match, {{two or more}} competitors fight to either gain a pinfall, submission, or climb a ladder to retrieve an envelope or a championship belt in no disqualification rules. In this particular one there were two envelopes, one with a contract for the championship match, while {{the other one was}} empty. At TNA's previous PPV, Final Resolution, Abyss attacked Hardy after his match with Scott Hall. On the January 21 episode of Impact!, Abyss attacked Hardy once again and this time by slamming him through a table. On the January 28 episode of Impact!, TNA advertised the debut of Full Metal Mayhem between Hardy and Abyss at Against All <b>Odds.</b> <b>On</b> the February 4 episode of Impact!, the second stipulation of the match was announced, that the winner would gain a future championship match on a future edition of Impact!.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 900 people {{attended}} Final Resolution. Canadian Online Explorer writer Bob Kapur rated the entire event a 6.5 out of 10, which {{was lower than}} the rating given to the 2005 installment. It was also lower than the 7.5 out of 10 the 2007 event was given by Chris Sokol. The Final Resolution ranking was lower than Turning Point's rating, which received a 7 out of 10 from Kapur. TNA's next PPV event, Against All <b>Odds,</b> <b>on</b> February12, 2006 was also ranked higher than Final Resolution; it received a rating of 7 out of 10 from Jason Clevett. Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) Royal Rumble PPV event which took place the same month, Final Resolution was ranked lower as Royal Rumble was given a 7 out of 10 by Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk.|$|E
5|$|After Final Resolution with Kurt Angle {{retaining}} the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, TNA had {{to determine who}} he would face at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008. On the January 17, 2008 episode of Impact!, Samoa Joe, Christian Cage, and A.J. Styles fought in a Three Way match {{to determine the number}} one contender. Stipulations for the match were that the winner would get a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match against Angle at Against All Odds, however if Styles won he could choose instead of the title match to allow Angle to not have to defend his title for two months. Cage ended up winning the contest, setting up Angle versus Cage at Against All <b>Odds.</b> <b>On</b> the January 24, 2008 episode of Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Joe would be the Special Outside Enforcer at Against All Odds due him being controversially disqualified during the match.

5|$|Secretariat, Sham, Pvt. Smiles, and My Gallant {{were the}} first four horses to be entered into the Belmont Stakes. Secretariat, winner of both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, was the <b>odds</b> <b>on</b> {{favorite}} to win the event. The added distance of the Belmont {{when compared to the}} Derby and Preakness was found to be one potential reason for Secretariat to lose the race. Steve Cady of the New York Times wrote that Secretariat could be defeated if the pace of the race went too fast or was too slow for too long, in both of which scenarios he felt Sham would win. Sham received significant attention as well and was thought to be the second best horse, along with having the potential of becoming the first horse to be runner-up in all the Triple Crown races. My Gallant was considered the best of the rest, especially as he was the progeny of Gallant Man, who set the Belmont Stakes course record of 2: in the 1957 edition.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{held the}} second-ever Elevation X match at Destination X between Rhino and James Storm. At Against All Odds, Rhino {{returned}} from injury to attack Storm during his encounter with Eric Young over the TNA World Beer Drinking Championship, reigniting their feud from mid-2007. Prior to this match, Rhino and Storm {{were involved in}} a storyline over past alcoholic issues by Rhino. This led to the two fighting at TNA's Victory Road PPV event on July 15, 2007, which Storm won. The two fought again at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on August 12 in a Bar Room Brawl, which Storm also won. Rhino defeated Storm at TNA's No Surrender PPV event on September 9, 2007, thus ending the feud. In late-2007, Rhino suffered an injury sidelining him until his return at Against All <b>Odds.</b> <b>On</b> the February 14, 2008, episode of Impact! Rhino challenged Storm to an Elevation X match.

5000|$|Individual casinos (and {{sometimes}} tables {{within a}} casino) vary greatly in the maximum odds they offer, from single or double odds (one or two times the pass line bet) up to 100x or even unlimited odds. A variation often seen is [...] "3-4-5X Odds", where the maximum allowed <b>odds</b> bet depends <b>on</b> the point: three times if {{the point is}} 4 or 10; four times on points of 5 or 9; or five times on points of 6 or 8. This rule simplifies the calculation of winnings: a maximum pass <b>odds</b> bet <b>on</b> a 3-4-5× table will always be paid at six times the pass line bet regardless of the point.|$|R
