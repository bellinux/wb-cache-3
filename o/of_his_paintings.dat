5|$|The English artist Henry Stacy Marks (1829-1888) took {{a special}} {{interest}} in birds and many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> were based on birds in the London Zoo and a number of his works included depictions of greater adjutants. Some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> that include adjutants are Convocation (1878), Science is Measurement (1879), Half hours at the Zoo and An Episcopal Visitation.|$|E
5|$|El Greco painted many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> on fine {{canvas and}} {{employed}} a viscous oil medium. He painted {{with the usual}} pigments of his period such as azurite, lead-tin-yellow, vermilion, madder lake, ochres and red lead, but he seldom used the expensive natural ultramarine.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's style {{evolved from}} realism to {{expressionism}} to a powerful folk style, {{for which he}} is best known. A substantial collection <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings,</b> watercolors, and prints is held by the Smithsonian American Art Museum, which has organized and circulated major exhibitions of his works.|$|E

5|$|The American painter John Quidor based many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> on {{scenes from}} the works of Irving about Dutch New York, {{including}} such paintings as Ichabod Crane Flying from the Headless Horseman (1828), The Return of Rip Van Winkle (1849), and The Headless Horseman Pursuing Ichabod Crane (1858).|$|E
5|$|A few sculptures, {{including}} Epimetheus and Pandora, {{have been}} attributed to El Greco. This doubtful attribution is based on the testimony of Pacheco (he saw in El Greco's studio a series of figurines, but these may have been merely models). There are also four drawings among the surviving works of El Greco; three of them are preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the fourth is a study for one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings,</b> The Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings,</b> Telemachus Rescues Antiope {{from the}} Fury of the Wild Boar, was finally {{accepted}} for the Summer Exhibition. Etty was becoming widely respected at the Royal Academy for his painting, particularly {{his use of}} colour {{and his ability to}} produce realistic flesh tones, and from 1811 onwards had at least one work accepted for the Summer Exhibition each year. However, he had little commercial success and generated little interest over the next few years.|$|E

5|$|Salford now {{has many}} tourist attractions, such as Ordsall Hall, the Bridgewater Canal and the Lowry Centre, an award-winning theatre and art gallery complex, {{consisting}} of two theatres and three art galleries. The centre is named after the artist L. S. Lowry, who attended Salford School of Art and lived in nearby Pendlebury for 40years. Many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> of Salford and Manchester mill scenes, populated with small matchstick-like figures, are on display.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{has also}} {{been referred to as}} Nevesta ("The Bride"), Kite mladu ("The Bride is Being Decorated") and Oprema mlade ("Bridal Trousseau"). The artist did not assign titles to his works, as he felt that if a painting was well composed viewers would be able to deduce the title themselves. As such, the majority <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> are referred to by a number of different titles.|$|E
5|$|Townshend sold Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret {{two years}} after Etty's death for 510guineas. It then passed through the hands of several owners over {{subsequent}} years, selling for a slightly lower sum each time. It was likely an influence on John Everett Millais's 1870 The Knight Errant, which also showed a distressed nude woman being rescued; although Millais disliked Etty's later works, several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> were strongly influenced by the artist.|$|E

5|$|During {{the years}} from 1935 to 1956, Jolin {{spent much of his}} time travelling. In 1954, he toured the United States with an exhibition. It was opened in January, by Swedish {{ambassador}} Erik Boheman, at Galerie St. Etienne in New York. Secretary-General of the United Nations Dag Hammarskjöld, attended the exhibition and bought a painting depicting Riddarholmen for his study of the United Nations building. The exhibition was shown on national TV in the United States. Jolin also exhibited his works at galleries in several other countries, and in 1957, the Liljevalchs konsthall hosted a retrospective exhibition featuring over 200 <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lander's Peak was an {{immediate}} success; twelve hundred people were invited for the exhibition, and almost a thousand showed up. Bierstadt was a shrewd self-promoter {{as well as a}} gifted artist, and this was the first <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> to be widely promoted with a single-picture exhibition, accompanied by a pamphlet, engravings and a tour. The painting, with its ten-foot width, was intended both for exhibition halls and the homes of America's emergent millionaire class. In 1865 it was purchased by British railway entrepreneur James McHenry for the (at the time) high price of $25,000. Bierstadt later bought it back, and gave or sold it to his brother Edward, before it was eventually acquired for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo was, and is, renowned {{primarily}} as a painter. Among his works, the Mona Lisa is the most famous and most parodied portrait and The Last Supper the most reproduced religious painting of all time. Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items {{as varied as the}} euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> have survived. Nevertheless, these few works, together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, Michelangelo.|$|E

5|$|Needled by {{repeated}} {{attacks from}} the press on his supposed indecency, poor taste and lack of creativity, Etty changed his approach after the response to Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm. He exhibited over 80 further paintings at the Royal Academy alone, and remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from this time made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons. He died in November 1849 and, while his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity, interest in him declined over time, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> had fallen below their original prices.|$|E
5|$|The National Gallery {{has also}} been criticised for misattributing paintings. Kenneth Clark's {{decision}} in 1939 to relabel a group of paintings by anonymous artists of the Venetian school as works by Giorgione (a crowd-pulling artist due to the rarity <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings)</b> made him unpopular with his staff. More recently, the attribution of a 17th-century painting of Samson and Delilah (bought in 1980) to Rubens has been contested {{by a group of}} art historians, who believe that the National Gallery has not admitted the mistake to avoid embarrassing those {{who were involved in the}} purchase, many of whom still work for the Gallery.|$|E
5|$|The {{cover of}} Dylan's album Self Portrait (1970) is a {{reproduction}} of {{a painting of a}} face by Dylan. Another <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> is reproduced {{on the cover of the}} 1974 album Planet Waves. In 1994 Random House published Drawn Blank, a book of Dylan's drawings. In 2007, the first public exhibition of Dylan's paintings, The Drawn Blank Series, opened at the Kunstsammlungen in Chemnitz, Germany; it showcased more than 200 watercolors and gouaches made from the original drawings. The exhibition coincided with the publication of Bob Dylan: The Drawn Blank Series, which includes 170 reproductions from the series. From September 2010 until April 2011, the National Gallery of Denmark exhibited 40 large-scale acrylic paintings by Dylan, The Brazil Series.|$|E

5|$|Dwindling party {{membership}} created {{many problems}} for Quisling, especially financial ones. For {{years he had}} been in financial difficulties and reliant on his inheritance, while increasing numbers <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> were found to be copies when he tried to sell them. Vidkun and his brother Arne sold one Frans Hals painting for just four thousand dollars, believing it to be a copy and not the fifty-thousand-dollar artwork they had once thought it to be, only to see it reclassified as an original and revalued at a hundred thousand dollars. In the difficult circumstances of the Great Depression, even originals did not raise as much as Quisling had hoped. His disillusionment with Norwegian society was furthered by news of the planned constitutional reform of 1938, which would extend the parliamentary term from three to four years with immediate effect, a move Quisling bitterly opposed.|$|E
5|$|The Gallery’s lack {{of space}} {{remained}} acute in this period. In 1845 a large bequest of British paintings {{was made by}} Robert Vernon; there was insufficient room in the Wilkins building so these were displayed first in Vernon’s town house at No. 50 Pall Mall and then at Marlborough House. The Gallery was even less well equipped for its next major bequest, as J. M. W. Turner was to bequeath the entire contents of his studio, excepting unfinished works, to the nation upon his death in 1851. The first 20 of these were displayed off-site in Marlborough House in 1856. Ralph Nicholson Wornum the Gallery's Keeper and Secretary, worked with John Ruskin to bring the bequest together. The stipulation in Turner's will that two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> be displayed alongside works by Claude is still honoured in Room 15 of the Gallery, but his bequest has never been adequately displayed in its entirety; today the works are divided between Trafalgar Square and the Clore Gallery, a small purpose-built extension to the Tate completed in 1985.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{long history}} of {{painting}} candlelit scenes in Western art, although as Wright had not at this date travelled abroad, there remains uncertainty as to what paintings he might have seen in the original, as opposed to prints. Nicolson, who made studies of both Wright and other candlelight painters such as the 17th-century Utrecht Caravaggisti, thought their paintings, among the largest in the style, those most likely to have influenced Wright. However Judy Egerton wonders if he could have seen any, preferring as influences the far smaller works of the Leiden fijnschilder Godfried Schalcken (1643–1706), whose reputation was much greater in the early 18th century than subsequently. He had worked in England from 1692 to 1697, and several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> can be placed in English collections in Wright's day.|$|E

At the time, his style was inspired by Robert Bateman, Glen Loates and Andrew Wyeth.|$|R
