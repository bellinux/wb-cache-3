5|$|A. b. swaynei (Sclater, 1892) : Known as Swayne's hartebeest. Restricted to the {{southern}} Rift Valley in Ethiopia. It formerly occurred throughout the Rift Valley, and its range extended eastward into northwestern Somalia. It has disappeared from Somalia by 1930. Its populations are very low and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over {{the recent}} years, the house sparrow {{population}} has been <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in many Asian countries, and this decline is quite evident in India. To promote the conservation of these birds, in 2012, the house sparrow was declared as the state bird of Delhi.|$|E

50|$|Chi kofte was {{introduced}} in the United States by Armenian immigrants, and was commonly referred to as Armenian steak tartare. This term is not as common today based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> popularity of steak tartare.|$|R
5|$|Similar to {{the decline}} over time in wives as being portrayed solely as housekeepers, the {{portrayal}} of mothers as the primary physical care takers of children has been <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline.</b> Instead, {{there has been an}} increase in the portrayal of mothers as facilitating recreational activities with their offspring.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture, {{largely based}} on livestock, has {{traditionally}} been the main occupation in the central and western parts of the county. There are a mix of large and small farm businesses, and a thriving dairy sector in the Vale of Clwyd. Many of the towns have livestock markets and the farming industry supports farm machinery merchants, vets, feed merchants, contractors and all the ancillary trades connected with agriculture. With their incomes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline,</b> farmers have found opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and value-added food products.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the California {{sea lion}} is {{protected}} {{on the federal}} Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), passed in 1972, which outlaws hunting, killing, capture, and harassment of the animal. In 1994 {{an amendment to the}} Act allowed for the possibility of limited lethal removal of pinnipeds preying on endangered salmonids should the level of predation be documented to have a significant adverse impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> or recovery of ESA-listed salmonids. Applications have been granted for removal of several individual sea lions at Ballard Locks and at the Bonneville Dam, where up to 92 sea lions can be killed each year for a 5-year period.|$|E

5|$|Soon after, Thorpe {{announced}} his {{withdrawal from the}} Commonwealth Games due to a bout of bronchitis, which had stopped him from training. Thorpe's illness was later diagnosed as a strain of glandular fever, and after a further delay caused by a broken hand, {{he moved to the}} United States in July to work with Dave Salo. Further disruption followed when the Australian switched coaches, citing excessive and ongoing media attention. Thorpe's stay was constantly surrounded by rumours that he was suffering from ill discipline; this fuelled speculation that his international career was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline.</b>|$|E
5|$|The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources) {{lists the}} serval as least concern; {{the animal is}} also {{included}} in CITES Appendix II. A major threat {{to the survival of}} the serval include the degradation of wetlands and grasslands. Trade of serval skins, though <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline,</b> still occurs in countries such as Benin and Senegal. In western Africa, the serval has significance in traditional medicine. Pastoralists often kill servals to protect their animals, though servals generally do not prey upon livestock.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{contribution}} of agricultural sector to the state economy was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in 2012–13, through {{the strength of the}} allied livestock sector, it has picked up from 7.03% (2011–12) to 7.2%. In the 2013–14 fiscal period, {{the contribution}} has been estimated at a high of 7.75%. The total growth of the farm sector has recorded a 4.39% increase in 2012–13, over a paltry 1.3% growth in the previous fiscal year. The agricultural sector has a share of 9.34% in the sectoral distribution of Gross State Domestic Product at Constant Price, while the secondary and tertiary sectors has contributed 23.94% and 66.72% respectively.|$|E
30|$|Further, Hathaway and Litan (2014), {{in their}} study <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> {{business}} dynamism in the United States, observed that older and larger business fared better than younger and smaller ones, resulting to <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in <b>the</b> number of start-ups. This led Murphy (2015), in her article, to note that a continued <b>decline</b> in <b>the</b> US business dynamism might persist even more rapidly, if the growth of large corporations is left unchallenged.|$|R

5|$|Although Herodotus {{presents}} the revolt {{as a consequence}} of Aristagoras and Histiaeus's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway. The primary grievance was the tyrants installed by the Persians. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline.</b> Moreover, past tyrants had tended (and needed) to be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply the representatives of the Persians. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia, and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the war, the power of the British East India Company was on the rise, whereas the Maratha Empire was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> (although they had only ruled for a very short duration, may be the reason was they never had {{intellectual}} capabilities and could only defeat Mughals when there was no great king left) The British had been victorious in the previous Anglo-Maratha war and Hindu Brahmin Marathas were at their mercy. The Peshwa of the Maratha Empire at this time was Baji Rao II. Several Maratha leaders who had formerly sided with the Peshwa were now under British control or protection. The British had an arrangement with the Gaekwad dynasty of the Maratha province of Baroda to prevent the Peshwa from collecting revenue in that province. Gaekwad sent an envoy to the Peshwa in Pune to negotiate a dispute regarding revenue collection. The envoy, Gangadhar Shastri, was under British protection. He was murdered, and the Peshwa's minister Trimbak Dengle was suspected of the crime.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Rossen co-wrote, {{produced}} and directed The Hustler. Drawing upon his own {{experiences as a}} pool hustler, he teamed with Sidney Carroll to adapt the novel {{of the same name}} for the screen. The Hustler was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won two. Rossen was nominated as Best Director and with Carroll for Best Adapted Screenplay but did not win either award. He was named Best Director by the New York Film Critics Circle and shared with Carroll the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written Drama. The Hustler was an enormous popular success and is credited with sparking a resurgence in the popularity of pool in the United States, which had been <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> for decades.|$|E

5|$|In the Pacific Northwest {{there is}} a stark {{contrast}} in Riesling production. The grape is currently {{on the rise in}} Washington State but <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in neighboring Oregon. Riesling from this area ranges from dry to sweet, and has a crisp lightness that bodes well for easy drinking. Often there will be an easily detectable peach and mineral complex. Some Washington State winemakers, such as Chateau Ste. Michelle, are adapting German-style Riesling production methods, and even partnering with well-known German vintners like Dr. Ernest Loosen to create specialty wines such as the Eroica Riesling. With annual productions of over 2,000,000 cases a year, Chateau Ste. Michelle is the worldwide leader in the production of Riesling wines by volume. In 2007 Pacific Rim Winemakers, another Pacific Northwest winery and owned by Randall Grahm of Bonny Doon, has built the first wine facility in Red Mountain AVA dedicated completely to Riesling production.|$|E
5|$|Serving as {{attorney}} general in Governor Adair's administration, Sharp had {{become involved in the}} Old Court – New Court controversy. The conflict was primarily between debtors who sought relief from their financial burdens after the Panic of 1819 (the New Court, or Relief, faction) and the creditors to whom these obligations were owed (the Old Court, or Anti-Relief, faction). Sharp, who came from humble beginnings, sided with the New Court. By 1825, the New Court faction's power was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline.</b> In an attempt to bolster the party's influence, Sharp resigned {{as attorney}} general in 1825 to run for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives. His opponent was Old Court stalwart John J. Crittenden.|$|E
5|$|Su {{continued}} {{his career as}} military general, and later commanded Tang forces in a war against Baekje in 660. The Tang Dynasty achieved its maximum extent following its conquest of the Khaganate. The inhabitants of the new territory did not become sinicized {{like many of the}} other kingdoms and tribes conquered by the Tang. Tang military activity in Central Asia brought in a wave of Turkic migrants serving in the Tang military as soldiers and generals, leading to the spread of Turkic language and culture. At the same time, the prevalence of Indo-European languages in the Western Regions was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline.</b> Central Asia also absorbed cultural influences from Tang China. Central Asian art incorporated Tang stylistic features, like the sancai three color glaze used in pottery. Chinese coins remained in circulation in Xinjiang after the decline of the Tang. Cultural remnants of Tang architectural influence are still visible in the Buddhist architecture of Dunhuang, on the border between the Western Regions and the Hexi Corridor.|$|E
50|$|After days {{of heavy}} rain a 12-14 yard section of <b>the</b> tunnel {{collapsed}} <b>on</b> 18 October 1907, leaving a large {{hole in a}} field near the road to Harthill.

5|$|The Greco-Persian Wars {{had their}} roots in the conquest of the Greek cities of Asia Minor, and in {{particular}} Ionia, by the Persian Empire of Cyrus the Great shortly after 550 BC. The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule, eventually settling for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city. While Greek states {{had in the past}} often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline.</b> By 500 BC, Ionia appears to have been ripe for rebellion against these Persian place-men. The simmering tension finally broke into open revolt due to the actions of the tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras. Attempting to save himself after a disastrous Persian-sponsored expedition in 499 BC, Aristagoras chose to declare Miletus a democracy. This triggered similar revolutions across Ionia, and indeed Doris and Aeolis, beginning the Ionian Revolt.|$|E
5|$|The Jin assault {{commenced}} in mid December 1126. Even as fighting raged on, Qinzong {{continued to}} sue for peace, but Jin demands for territory were enormous: they wanted all provinces north of the Yellow River. After more than twenty days of heavy combat against the besieging forces, Song defenses were decimated and the morale of Song soldiers was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline.</b> On January 9, 1127, the Jurchens broke through and started to loot the conquered city. Emperor Qinzong tried to appease the victors by offering the remaining wealth of the capital. The royal treasury was emptied and the belongings of the city's residents were seized. The Song emperor offered his unconditional surrender a few days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the tomb is praised and also derided; it is derided {{for the lack of}} proportioning of its various units and use of poor material for construction. Reginald Heber, who was Bishop of Calcutta between 1823 and 1826, based on the light brown colour of the stone used, had observed that the tomb has the “colour of potted meat”. Even ASI has observed that the marble used for ornamentation in the towers though pleasing is “rather florid”. Another observation is that the tomb can not be compared to the Taj Mahal or the Humayun Tomb, as, {{at the time it was}} built, the Mughal Empire was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> and sandstone had to be used and lines were set improperly and the quality appeared “thread bare”.|$|E
50|$|Others speculated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{negative}} impact of the retirement of the Baby Boom generation and the relative cost to rent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> housing market. In {{many parts of the}} United States, it was significantly cheaper to rent the same property than to purchase it; the national median mortgage payment is $1,687 per month, nearly twice the median rent payment of $868 per month.|$|R
