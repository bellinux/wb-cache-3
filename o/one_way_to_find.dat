2500|$|In any planar graph, the pathwidth is at most {{proportional}} to the square root {{of the number of}} vertices. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a path-decomposition with this width is (similarly to the logarithmic-width path-decomposition of forests described above) to use the planar separator theorem to find a set of O(√n) vertices the removal of which separates the graph into two subgraphs of at most 2n/3 vertices each, and concatenate recursively-constructed path decompositions for each of these two subgraphs. The same technique applies to any class of graphs for which a similar separator theorem holds. Since, like planar graphs, the graphs in any fixed minor-closed graph family have separators of size O(√n), it follows that the pathwidth of the graphs in any fixed minor-closed family is again O(√n). For some classes of planar graphs, the pathwidth of the graph and the pathwidth of its dual graph must be within a constant factor of each other: bounds of this form are known for [...] biconnected outerplanar graphs and for polyhedral graphs. For 2-connected planar graphs, the pathwidth of the dual graph is less than the pathwidth of the line graph. It remains open whether the pathwidth of a planar graph and its dual are always within a constant factor of each other in the remaining cases.|$|E

In this paper we discuss how a multi-dimensional characterization of evolutionary clusters can help identify severe structural weaknesses. In addressing this question we describe (1) properties used for characterizing evolutionary clusters, (2) scenarios characterizing severe structural issues, and (3) the mapping of such scenarios to queries on a set of evolutionary clusters, resulting in a subset denoting severe structural issues according to that scenario. We apply the proposed characterization to the case of a large embedded software system having a development history of more than a decade. I...|$|R

In this paper, we present these conditions. We show how they can be used with constraint program-ming techniques to fix directly some variables of the problem. Hence, reducing strongly the size of the problem. For example, for low densityproblems of size lower than 50, those conditions combined with constraint programming may be sufficient to solve completely the problem, withoutbranching.

A small number of mismatches (due to differences between the sequenced DNA and reference DNA, or errors) can be accounted for by dividing the fragment into smaller fragments—at least one subfragment is likely to match the reference DNA sequence. The matching requires constructing an inverted index of all substrings of a certain length from the reference DNA sequence. Since the human DNA contains more than 3 billion base pairs, and we need to store a DNA substring for every index and a 32-bit integer for index itself, the storage requirement for such an inverted index would probably be in the tens of gigabytes.|$|E

As any vertex cover of the input graph must use a distinct vertex to cover each edge that was considered in the process (since it forms a matching), the vertex cover produced, therefore, is at most twice as large as the optimal one.

Accordingly we can consider a team game havbing a shared utility which is a performance measure of the behavior of the MAS. For such a scenario the game is at equilibrium — the Lagrangian is optimized — when the joint distribution of the agents optimizes the system’s expected performance. <b>One</b> common <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> that equilibrium is to have each agent run a reinforcement learning algorithm.
