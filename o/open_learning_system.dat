Many critics applaud the recent higher education policy endeavours to massify South African higher education, as the exclusionary system of the past is gradually being replaced by attempts to expose learners to <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> <b>systems</b> and this in accordance with the initiatives to globalise education. Massification has the potential of playing an immense role in redressing past imbalances as it accommodates historically disadvantaged learners.

The proposed solution is called System of Teaching Intelligent Interventions (STII) and facilitates the authoring, deployment, and evaluation of Web-based metaphors. This paper discusses the use of metaphors for assisting students to comprehend the substance of cognitive concepts and their basic background. STII has been applied in a particular educational scenario during the learning process of 228 students attending the course “computer applications. ” The presentation of results from a pilot evaluation of two metaphors demonstrates the usefulness of the system. The evaluation focuses on the impact of the two metaphors on student learning, and on detecting potential correlations between metaphors and students ’ groups.

This reveals {{the fact that there is}} a serious gap between the skills that are required by the employers and the skills that the graduates possess. Therefore, this research is focused on five aspects of generic skills namely; communication, team work, problem solving, lifelong learning and self-esteem. From Qur’anic perspective, the same terms have been used except minor differences in using various terms. The thematic approach is used when discussing these aspects from the Qur’an. The findings showed that the ways of effective communication are represented by terms of qawl sadid, qawl ma`ruf, qawl baligh, qawl maysur, qawl karim and qawl layyin.

30|$|In view of {{the current}} open {{education}} discourse, Al-Jumeily, Hussain, Alghamdi, Dobbins und Lunn present a position paper devoted to the context of all the three above-listed emerging trends in open learning. This paper focuses on an innovative research, across multiple disciplines. It discusses significant challenges and existing issues around upcoming crowdsourcing applications and intelligent adaptive systems. Giving {{special attention to the}} rapidly broadening development of open learning and open access to education, this research contributes to evolving current technology-enhanced learning approaches toward a novel <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> <b>system</b> by the utilization of the advantages of crowdsourcing and adaptive systems. The proposed adaptive, student-centric learning system caters for either individual or group learning and differentiates itself from other tutoring and programming support technologies due to its inherent ability to monitor and assess students’ performance in each phase of the education process. Thus, it is especially appropriate for teaching and enhancing programming skills, building software, and then as necessary executing, debugging, and correcting the solutions. Furthermore, it addresses the demand for appropriately designed intelligent systems that serve various learners, in terms of distinctive available and/or desired skills and knowledge. The proposed framework underpins the merge between an intelligent adaptive system and crowdsourcing approaches to be beneficially applied toward the improvement of teaching processes and programming skills, especially very useful for novice programmers, in an open learning context, combining the outcomes of traditional, and promising ground-breaking research to serve today’s needs. Against this background, the authors pioneer a new line of research and development in novel open education settings.|$|E
