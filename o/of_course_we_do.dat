2500|$|In November 2008, {{the skull}} was {{exhibited}} at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam next to an exhibition of paintings from the museum collection selected by Hirst. Wim Pijbes, the museum director, said of the exhibition, [...] "It boosts our image. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> the Old Masters {{but we are not}} a 'yesterday institution'. It's for now. And Damien Hirst shows this in a very strong way." ...|$|E
60|$|NORA [a little consoled]. Yes: <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> [He {{does not}} reply]. I wonder {{you came back}} at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you won't {{consider}} taking in two more, providing, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{our share of}} work and pay our share of the expenses." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> {{and took}} down a basket {{to bring up}} some apples to roast.|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>did.</b> This was exciting. Nobody {{would ever}} have {{suspected}} Davenport of seeing ghosts.|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> {{and tumbled}} {{over each other}} in our eagerness to get the nearest place to the narrator.|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{not mean}} to say that these {{children}} were good from principle. They had no principle at that time. No, their actuating motive was selfishness; but it was not concentrated, regardless selfishness, and it was beautifully counteracted by natural amiability of temperament.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{not suggest}} that giving in to little sensations of ailment is either wise or manly. There are duties which call on men to fight even in sickness--ay, in spite of sickness--but [...] "showing off" [...] in the arena {{was not one of}} these.|$|E
6000|$|... "For this {{enterprise}} {{we require}} an agent to perform {{one of the}} principal parts. This agent must possess great ability, and, at the same time, be a man on whom we can thoroughly rely. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not expect to find such qualities without paying for them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Here is how A. N. Safonov {{describes}} this: [...] This phenomenon {{was observed}} by nearby sailors. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not file any official reports. The navy usually concealed such information to avoid taking the blameâ€¦ ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>did.</b> <b>We</b> all {{sat down}} at the roots of the firs. Felix, having finally squared matters with his nose, turned around and listened also. He would not look at Cecily, but every one else had forgiven her.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you do not}} say how it {{was that}} you were taken ill," [...] she said, her cheeks {{suddenly}} glowing. [...] "You saved her son's life. We saw all {{about it in the}} papers, but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not know that it was you. It was splendid!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{not want}} all these {{measures}} {{for a single}} arch, but it often happens {{that some of them}} are attainable more easily than others; some are often unattainable altogether, and it is necessary therefore to have expressions for whichever {{we may be able to}} determine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely thou forgettest something. Tongue of the King, thou who {{are named}} Mopo, or Umbopa, Son of Makedama; thou forgettest certain words which the Inkosazana whispered to thee when {{she threw her}} cloak about thy head ere thou fleddest away from the Council of the King. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know the words, but why dost thou not repeat them, Tongue of the King?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{says she}} will stay with George Moore until he can leave the hospital. She has written to his people in Nova Scotia. It seems that George's only near {{relative}} is a married sister much older than himself. She was living when George sailed on the Four Sisters, but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know what may have happened since. Did you ever see George Moore, Miss Cornelia?" ...|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not then {{know what was}} being done; but later {{we learned that the}} President's mansion, the Treasury buildings, the Arsenal, and the barracks, where three {{thousand}} troops could be quartered, were all laid in ashes under the orders of General Ross and Admiral Cockburn.|$|R
60|$|As {{a matter}} <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not dare linger here or there, {{although}} very much {{was going on}} which it would have pleased me to observe; but we took good care to continue without hesitation toward the Pigeon Quarter, contenting ourselves with seeing what we might as we walked at a reasonably rapid pace.|$|R
60|$|Planting the oar for a mast was no easy matter. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{not attempt}} to <b>do</b> it until <b>we</b> had made the boom, and also a small {{crosstree}} at the top, from which we suspended the sail, not very artistically, it is true, but in such a fashion that it drew very well.|$|R
6000|$|... "As Miller {{did go to}} meet Girty, and as he did {{not return}} to the Fort with the renegade, we must believe he is dead. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know this to be {{actually}} a fact. But something makes me think so. Jonathan and Wetzel have not said anything; I can't get any satisfaction on that score from either; but I am sure neither of them would rest until Miller was dead." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{not mean}} to say that the sun itself, or its direct rays, {{actually}} danced. No, it was too dignified a luminary for that, but its rays went straight at a small looking-glass which was suspended on the wall opposite to the window, and this being hung so as to slope forward, projected the rays obliquely into a tub of water which was destined for family washing purposes; and from its gently moving surface they were transmitted to the ceiling, where, as aforesaid, they danced, to the immense delight of Maggot junior.|$|E
60|$|It {{may seem}} strange, {{nevertheless}} it is true, that ignorance is a misfortune which {{now and then}} results in good. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not make this remark in commendation of ignorance, but if Baldwin Burr had not been ignorant and densely stupid, Philosopher Jack {{would not have had}} the pleasure of instructing him, and the seaman himself would not have enjoyed that close intimacy which frequently subsists between teacher and pupil. Even Polly Samson derived benefit from Baldwin's want of knowledge, for, being remarkably intelligent for her years, and having been well taught, she took great pleasure in enlightening his darkness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{your luck}} has been {{something}} awful. It did seem that with the pains that we took, and the way I cleared the ground for you by bribing jockeys and so on, {{we ought to have}} made pots <b>of</b> money. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> pull off some good things, but others we looked on as safe, and went in for heavily, all turned out wrong." ...|$|R
60|$|It is, perhaps, {{needless to}} say that they interlarded their {{conversation}} with fearful oaths, to which <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> can <b>do</b> no more than make passing reference.|$|R
60|$|DEAR MOTHER: A most curious {{thing has}} happened. But I {{may as well}} begin at the beginning. When I stopped writing last evening at the summons of the General, I {{was about to tell}} you {{something}} of the battle of Bentonville on Tuesday last. Mower charged through as bad a piece of wood and swamp as I ever saw, and got within one hundred yards of Johnston himself, who was at the bridge across Mill Creek. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not know this at the time, and learned it from prisoners.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you {{listening}} till {{you feel that}} your ears are the size of footballs? Then drink this in. For weeks you have been praying {{for a chance to}} show your devotion to the great cause; or if you haven't, you ought to have been. That chance has come. You alone can save us. In a sense, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not need to be saved. They will find it hard to get at us, I fancy, on the roof. But it ill befits the dignity of the editorial staff of a great New York weekly to roost like pigeons for any length of time; and consequently it is up to you." ...|$|E
60|$|Such a {{voice was}} that of our heroine. It drew towards her the soul, body, and spirit of the music-lovers who listened. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not deny {{that there were some}} who could not be drawn thus. There were a few, among the smoky crystals, for whom a draw of the pipe or a mildly drawn pot of bitter beer had greater charms than sweet sounds, however melting. With the {{exceptions}} of these, nearly all who chanced to be within hearing drew near to the musical group, and listened while that most, beautiful of songs was being warbled in tones not loud but inexpressibly pathetic.|$|E
60|$|Lastly {{we have to}} assert--and the {{assertion}} will, we doubt not, cause extreme surprise--that the discipline of science is superior to that of our ordinary education, because of the religious culture that it gives. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not here use the words scientific and religious in their ordinary limited acceptations; but in their widest and highest acceptations. Doubtless, to the superstitions that pass {{under the name of}} religion, science is antagonistic; but not to the essential religion which these superstitions merely hide. Doubtless, too, in much of the science that is current, there is a pervading spirit of irreligion; but not in that true science which had passed beyond the superficial into the profound.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't say she will, Mr Lynch, but I say she may. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> must <b>do</b> what <b>we</b> can for her," [...] and {{the doctor}} took his sherry and went his way.|$|R
6000|$|It was a {{magnificent}} room, and more magnificent bed, and sitting up among her lace and cambric pillows and coverlets was Queen Anne of Austria, {{in a rich}} white lace cap and bedgown that set off her smooth, fair, plump beauty, and exquisite hands and arms. Ladies stood round the bed. I did not then see who any of them were, for this was the crisis of my fate, and my heart beat and my eyes swam with anxiety. Queen Henrietta made her low reverence, as <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> and some words of sisterly greeting ensued, after which the English queen said: ...|$|R
6000|$|After we had {{finished}} our second tour round the drum, {{with the utmost}} solemnity, one of the monks approached Hilda, whom he seemed to take now for an important priestess. He said something to her in Tibetan, which, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not understand; but, as {{he pointed at the}} same time to the brother on the floor who was turning the wheel, Hilda nodded acquiescence. [...] "If you wish it," [...] she said in English--and he appeared to comprehend. [...] "He wants to know whether I would like to take a turn at the cylinder." ...|$|R
60|$|Most {{of us are}} {{familiar}} with the sumac-bush, which grows nearly all over the United States. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not mean the poisonous swamp-sumac, but that which grows along the fences and on the edges of the woods. Of late years the leaves of this bush have been greatly in demand for tanning purposes, and, in some States, especially in Virginia, sumac gathering has become a very important branch of industry, particularly with the negroes; many of whom, during the sumac season, prefer gathering these leaves to doing any other kind of work. The sumac-bush is quite low, and the leaves are easily stripped off. They are then carefully dried, and packed in bags, and carried to the nearest place of sale, generally a country store.|$|E
6000|$|We {{are afraid}} that truth {{requires}} us to state, that Snorro had not quite {{reached the age of}} reciprocal attachment--at least in regard to men. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not pretend to know anything about the mysterious feelings which he was reported to entertain towards his mother and nurse! All we can say is, that up to this point in his history the affections of that first-born of Vinland appeared to centre chiefly in his stomach--who fed him best he loved most! It is but simple justice to add, however, that Olaf was, in Snorro's eye, an exception to the rule. We really believe that if Olaf had starved and beaten him {{during the first half of}} a day, by way of experiment, Snorro would have clung to him and loved him throughout the other half! ...|$|E
6000|$|Here, being {{thoroughly}} exhausted, it {{was resolved}} {{that they should}} spend that day and night, and, we need scarcely add, they spent a considerable portion of both in sleep--at least such parts of both as were not devoted to food. And here the professor distinguished himself {{in a way that}} raised him greatly in the estimation of his companions and caused the natives of the place to regard him as something of a demi-god. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not vouch for the truth of the details of the incident, for no one save himself was there to see, and although we entertained the utmost regard for himself, we were not sufficiently acquainted with his moral character to answer for his strict truthfulness. As to the main event, there was no denying that. The thing happened thus:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is mine," [...] he said, [...] "but not the contents. This is fat; {{mine was}} flat; mine was light; this is heavy." [...] He opened it; it was stuffed as full {{as it could}} hold with gold coins. He let us gaze our fill; and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> gaze, for <b>we</b> had never seen so much money at one time before. All our mouths came open to say [...] "Satan did it!" [...] but nothing came out. There it was, you see--we couldn't tell what Satan didn't want told; he had said so himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Granny, {{you are a}} wonder!" [...] {{he exclaimed}} admiringly. [...] "I never should have thought <b>of</b> that. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>we</b> can <b>do</b> it. My, won't Bowser be surprised! And how mad he'll be! Come on, let's be starting!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{was only}} fooling," [...] {{answered}} Fred. [...] "I wouldn't {{be afraid to}} ride right up to his door. That is, in the daytime. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> if <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it at night he might become suspicious." ...|$|R
