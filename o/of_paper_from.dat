By 750 CE, they came to conquer most of the Near East, North Africa, and parts of Europe, ushering {{in an era of}} learning, science, and invention known as the Islamic Golden Age. The knowledge and skills of the ancient Near East, Greece, and Persia were preserved in the Postclassical Era by Muslims, who also added new and important innovations from outside, such as the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>from</b> China and decimal positional numbering from India.|$|E
25|$|Dried hemp {{has about}} 57% {{cellulose}} (the principal ingredient in paper), compared to about 40-50% in wood. Hemp {{also has the}} advantage of a lower lignin content: hemp contains only 5-24% lignin against the 20-35% found in wood. This lignin must be removed chemically and wood requires more use of chemicals in the process. The actual production of hemp fiber in the U.S continued to decline until 1933 to around 500 tons/year. Between 1934 and 1935, the cultivation of hemp began to increase but still at a very low level and with no significant increase <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>from</b> hemp.|$|E

25|$|The {{drinking}} straw is a tube used for transferring a liquid to the mouth, usually {{a drink from}} one location to another. The first crude forms of {{drinking straw}}s were made of dry, hollow, rye grass. Marvin Stone is {{the inventor of the}} drinking straw. Stone, who worked in a factory that made paper cigarette holders, did not like this design because it made beverages taste like grass. As an alternative, on January 3, 1888, Stone got a piece <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>from</b> his factory and wrapped it around a pencil. By coating it with wax, his drinking straw became leak-proof so that it would not get waterlogged.|$|E
25|$|Ben Wysocki, {{a former}} bandmate of Isaac Slade, joined as drummer and later, Dave Welsh, who was another former bandmate of Slade and Wysocki, was added as lead guitarist to the band. The newly formed band {{was named the}} Fray. The band members decided on a name after asking people to put band names on a piece <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>from</b> which they picked randomly. The members of the band first claimed that they found the name {{suitable}} because they frequently quarreled about {{the composition of the}} lyrics in their songs, but they have since stated they are usually on good terms while composing music and acknowledges contributions from all of its members. The band has had no permanent bassist since Caleb, instead employing touring bassists on a temporary basis. The current bassist is Jason Hardin, who has been touring with the band since 2014.|$|E

By the early 2000s, {{it was clear that}} Black had accurately anticipated the decline in profitability of print media assets and sought to divest those types of assets held by Hollinger before their value was irrevocably diminished. The criminal sanctions on Black not overturned were for removing 13 boxes <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>from</b> his office a few days before he had to move offices, and under the gaze of security cameras he has installed, and for receiving US $285,000 as a non-compete payment that was approved by the independent director and publicly disclosed, but where the company secretary had neglected, in what the trial judge considered to be a clerical oversight, to have signed by the parties.|$|E
25|$|The early Islamic Empire {{also had}} the highest {{literacy}} rates among pre-modern societies, alongside the city of classical Athens in the 4th century BC, and later, China after the introduction of printing from the 10th century. One factor for the relatively high literacy rates in the early Islamic Empire was its parent-driven educational marketplace, as the state did not systematically subsidize educational services until the introduction of state funding under Nizam al-Mulk in the 11th century. Another factor was the diffusion <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>from</b> China, which led to an efflorescence of books and written culture in Islamic society, thus papermaking technology transformed Islamic society (and later, the rest of Afro-Eurasia) from an oral to scribal culture, comparable to the later shifts from scribal to typographic culture, and from typographic culture to the Internet. Other factors include {{the widespread use of}} paper books in Islamic society (more so than any other previously existing society), the study and memorization of the Qur'an, flourishing commercial activity, and the emergence of the Maktab and Madrasah educational institutions.|$|E

In mitigation, Jeyaretnam made the point that, apart from immediate family and friends, the public would not have known about the 'subversive' tombstone nor its inscription in Singapore's biggest cemetery.|$|E

Lynch's early artwork mostly depicted war-related imagery—weaponry and fighter planes—based on his collection of toy military equipment.

Later in life, however, Lynch was summoned for conscription for the Vietnam War, and declared 4-F, [...] "unfit for military service", for [...] undisclosed health reasons.|$|E
500|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} Igor Kirillov, {{the senior}} Soviet news anchor, {{said that he}} was initially given a printed TASS report to announce over the news on September 1, which included an [...] "open and honest" [...] admission that the plane was shot down by mistake (a wrong judgement call by the Far Eastern Air Defence Command). However, at the moment the opening credits of the Vremya evening news programme rolled in, an editor ran in and snatched the sheet <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>from</b> his hand, handing him another TASS report which was [...] "completely opposite" [...] to the first one and to the truth.|$|E
500|$|In Silcott's case, {{according}} to the scientist who conducted the ESDA test, Robert Radley, the notes from {{the section of the}} fifth interview in which Silcott appeared to incriminate himself had been inserted after the other notes were written. The seventh and final page of the fifth interview, where the participants would normally sign, was missing. The ESDA test suggested that, on the third to sixth pages of the interview, no impressions had been left from previous pages, although these earlier impressions appeared {{throughout the rest of the}} notes. According to Will Bennett in The Independent, the test [...] "also revealed an imprint of a different page five from the one submitted in evidence which was clearly the same interview with Silcott but in which he made no implicit admissions." [...] In addition to this, David Baxendale, a Home Office forensic scientist who was asked to investigate by Essex police, said that the paper on which the disputed notes were written came from a different batch <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>from</b> the rest of the interview.|$|E

500|$|After World War 2, whilst most ports {{began to}} quickly contract, Blyth {{was still a}} major {{facility}} through the 1960s, when coal exports reached over 6 M tonnes per year. However, with the closure Blyth's last ship builder in 1966, the port began a significant period of contraction. The employment slack was in part {{taken up by the}} construction of the coal-fired Blyth Power Station, located on the northern bank. of the river. The A Station with 480megawatts (MW) of capacity first generated electricity in 1958, a year after the creation of the Central Electricity Generating Board, and the B Station with a capacity of 1,250MW four years later. The power stations' four large chimneys were a landmark of the Northumberland skyline for over 40years; the A Station's two chimneys each stood at the B Station's two chimneys were taller, at [...] each.

500|$|Tintin is {{informed}} by Thomson and Thompson of a case involving the ramblings of a drunken man, later killed, found with a scrap <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>from</b> {{what appears to be}} a tin of crab meat with the word [...] "Karaboudjan" [...] scrawled on it. His subsequent investigation and the kidnapping of a Japanese man interested in giving him a letter leads Tintin to a ship called the Karaboudjan, where he is abducted by a syndicate of criminals who have hidden opium in the crab tins. Tintin escapes from his locked room after Snowy chews through his bonds and Tintin knocks out a man sent to bring him food, leaving the man bound and gagged in the room. Tintin encounters Captain Haddock, an alcoholic sea captain, who is manipulated by his first mate, Allan, and is unaware of his crew's criminal activities. Tintin hides in the locker under the bed and defeats Jumbo, the sailor left in the cabin, while Allan thinks Tintin has climbed out of the porthole back into the storeroom. He blows open the storeroom door, then finding it empty goes back to the Captain's room, where he finds Jumbo tied to a chair and gagged. Escaping the ship in a lifeboat after sending a radio message to the police about the cargo, a seaplane tries to attack them. Tintin and the Captain hijack the plane, tie up the pilots, and try to reach Spain. Haddock's drunken behaviour in a storm causes them to crash-land in the Sahara, where the crew escapes.|$|E
