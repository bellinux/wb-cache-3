40|$|In {{repairable}} {{redundant systems}} the failed units {{can either be}} repaired or replaced by identical standby to reduce the system down time. The failed units are inspected for repair/replacement. In this paper, two stochastic models for 2 (k) -out-of- 3 (n) redundant system of identical units with repair and inspection are examined stochastically. The system is considered in up-state only if 2 (k) -out-of- 3 (n) units are operative in both the models. Normally, the server either attends the system promptly or may take some time, after failure. The system is studied under an <b>operational</b> <b>restriction</b> on the inspection i. e. in case when system has only one unit in operational mode the server has to attend the system for inspection. Semi-Markov processes and Regenerative point technique is adopted to obtain the expressions for measures of system effectiveness such as transition probabilities, mean sojourn times, mean time to system failure, steady state availabilities, busy periods, expected number of visits etc. Cost-analysis is also carried out for the system models...|$|E
40|$|Research Question and Problem Statement: Developing a {{sustainable}} financial systems for poor {{is critical for}} any developing economy particularly Bangladesh for various reasons. Firstly, it will include a large population of bankable poor into formal financial sector who are currently excluded and hence will benefit both parties over a long run. Secondly, generating sustainable funds for skilled/semi-skilled poor {{to start a business}} will increase number of micro and small enterprises and employment. Thirdly, sustainable financial service with access to credit can help poverty reduction through improving the productivity of micro and small enterprises or creating new opportunities of livelihood. Though micro credit for helping poor in the context of Bangladesh is not a new idea, yet question remains on the sustainability of such institutions which are mostly backed by donor funds or government funds with high risk of insolvency along with high transaction cost (due to high cost of capital at 26. 5 per cent on loan and advances) (Hossain, 1998, p. 7). The micro finance institutions are not recognised as regulated financial institutions which impact the ability and cost of finance and transactions. The regulatory and <b>operational</b> <b>restriction</b> often result in rationing out sectors of the client population which the institutions and programmes want to serve and eventually questions the sustainability of micro-finance institutions and programmes working with the poor. In this bleak situation, a second generation social bank in Bangladesh focusing on a new model to bank with poor {{is considered to be a}} bold step towards building sustainable financial system for banking with the poor. The main research objective is to explore the views held by bank directors as well as managers towards their mission statement for ‘Empowering real poor families and create local income opportunities’ and ‘Providing support for social benefit organizations - by way of mobilizing funds and social services’ and thus analyse the findings from the unique socio-economic-political-regulatory context of developing economy like Bangladesh. This longitudinal case study will explore the participatory three sector banking model developed by the bank which includes: i) Formal sector : dealing with human face approach to credit and banking on the profit and loss sharing ii) Non—formal sector: informal finance and credit package that empowers and humanizes real poor family and create local income opportunities and discourage internal migration iii) Voluntary sector: responding spontaneously to its social commitment to help hard core poor with various welfare activities The purpose of the study is to focus on the model for sustainable banking with the poor in the context of developing economy which will contribute towards reduction of poverty...|$|E

40|$|The freight routing {{problem of}} time-definite common {{carriers}} is {{to minimize the}} sum of handling and transportation costs, while meeting service commitments and <b>operational</b> <b>restrictions.</b> There {{are two types of}} <b>operational</b> <b>restrictions,</b> capacity and directed in-tree rooted at each destination. Directed in-tree implicitly implies that there is a singular path for each origin-destination pair. The routing problem is an integrality constrained multi-commodity problem with side constraints. In this research, we study two approaches, the Lagrangian relaxation (LR) and implicit enumeration algorithm with [var epsilon]-optimality (IE-[var epsilon]). We use the third largest time-definite freight delivery common carrier in Taiwan for our numerical test. The result shows that the IE-[var epsilon] outperforms the LR, both quantitatively and qualitatively. In addition, two major shortcomings of the LR approach are shown: it may fail to find any feasible solutions even though they exist, and it cannot determine whether the feasible set is empty or not. ...|$|R
