5|$|After Simpson's {{decision}} {{to focus on}} Fightstar, the band entered Criterion Studios in London with producer Mark Williams to begin work <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> EP, They Liked You Better When You Were Dead. It was released as a mini-album, containing nine tracks written during the six months Simpson and Westaway lived together.

5|$|After {{each team}} traded punts <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> {{possession}}s, Arkansas long snapper Will Coleman snapped {{the ball over}} the head of punter Dylan Breeding that gave Alabama possession at the Razorbacks' six-yard line. On the next play, Eddie Lacy scored on a six-yard run for a 7–0 Crimson Tide lead. The Razorbacks responded with an eight-play, 51-yard drive, but failed to score any points after a 41-yard Zach Hocker field goal hit the left upright.

5|$|An {{estimated}} {{four thousand}} Beatles' fans were present on 7 February 1964 as Pan Am Flight 101 left Heathrow Airport. Among the passengers were the Beatles, <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> {{trip to the}} United States as a band, with their entourage of photographers and journalists, and Phil Spector. When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed JohnF.KennedyAirport, they were greeted by a second large crowd, with Beatles fans again estimated to number four thousand, and journalists, two hundred. From having so many people packed in a little space, {{a few people in}} the crowd got injured. The airport had not previously experienced such a large crowd.|$|E
5|$|Between 1200 and 1600 several laws {{emerged that}} {{drastically}} altered the game. Checkmate became a requirement to win; a player could not win by capturing {{all of the}} opponent's pieces. Stalemate was added, although the outcome has changed several times (see History of the stalemate rule). Pawns gained the option of moving two squares <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> move, and the en passant rule was a natural consequence of that new option. The king and rook acquired the right to castle (see Variations throughout history of castling for {{different versions of the}} rule).|$|E
5|$|Britain sent eight {{athletes to}} compete in the {{bobsleigh}} events with entries in the two-man, four-man and two-woman competitions. Allyn Condon competed in the four-man event having previously taken part in the 4x100m relay at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney; the first Briton to take part in both a Summer and Winter Games since Marcus Adam. In the two-man the British pairing of Dan Money and John Jackson suffered a crash <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> run; they escaped serious injury, but were disqualified for failing to complete the run.|$|E

50|$|The {{album was}} {{announced}} after only two singles having been released for it, {{half of what}} was released for their original album G∞ver. This album focused more on rock music and less <b>on</b> pop, which <b>their</b> <b>first</b> album focused heavily <b>on.</b> Unlike <b>their</b> <b>first</b> album, almost all titles for the various songs are written in Japanese as opposed to English used in the band's first album.|$|R

5|$|Following the Elliot Minor tour, {{the group}} began writing {{material}} for their debut album. In late November and early December, the band went <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> headlining {{tour of the}} UK, with support from Flood of Red. During the latter month, the band wrote further material. All of the songs on the album were written and arranged by themselves. Typically, Helyer or Franceschi would have an idea that the band would then flesh out together. Occasionally, the band would record demos and change sections of them.|$|E
5|$|Following the Georgia Tech punt, Wake Forest {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the second quarter. Wake Forest, after a three and out, again punted the ball and Georgia Tech took over on offense. <b>On</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> full possession of the second quarter, Tech seemed to have more success moving the ball. Quarterback Reggie Ball picked up a first down running the ball, then completed a 22-yard pass to wide receiver Calvin Johnson, driving the Yellow Jackets inside Wake Forest territory. Once there, however, Wake Forest's defense stiffened. Ball was unable to complete two consecutive passes, and his third pass inside Wake Forest territory was intercepted.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time since 2009, Alabama played Kentucky at Lexington, and in the game Alabama {{defeated}} the Wildcats 48–7. Although the Crimson Tide defense opened the game strong and forced Kentucky to punt after they held the Wildcats to a series of three-and-outs on their initial possessions, the Alabama offense did not see the same on-field success. After they were held to a punt <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> possession, fumbles by Kenyan Drake and T. J. Yeldon on the next two Crimson Tide possessions inside the Wildcats' 15-yard line kept the game scoreless.|$|E

They were set to tour with Chimaira and All That Remains from January through March 2008, but due to singer Moody developing cysts on his vocal cords they were forced to pull out. He made a full recovery and they began to tour again. They supported Disturbed on their Indestructible US Tour from April through May 2008.|$|E
5|$|In the 75th {{edition of}} the Iron Bowl, the Auburn Tigers overcame a 24-point deficit to defeat the Crimson Tide 28–27. Alabama opened a 21–0 lead after the first quarter with {{touchdown}} scores <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> three offensive possessions. Touchdowns were scored on a nine-yard Mark Ingram run, a 68-yard Julio Jones reception from Greg McElroy and on a 12-yard Darius Hanks reception from McElroy. The lead was pushed to 24–0 {{in the second quarter}} after a 20-yard Jeremy Shelley field goal before the Tigers began their comeback.|$|E
5|$|In {{what was}} the first Bret Bielema coached team to play against the Crimson Tide, Alabama shut out the Arkansas Razorbacks 52–0 at Bryant–Denny Stadium.
