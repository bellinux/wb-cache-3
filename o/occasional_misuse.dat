25|$|Misuse of benzodiazepines is {{widespread}} amongst drug misusers; however, {{many of these}} people will not require withdrawal management as their use is often restricted to binges or <b>occasional</b> <b>misuse.</b> Benzodiazepine dependence when it occurs requires withdrawal treatment. There is little evidence of benefit from long-term substitution therapy of benzodiazepines, and conversely, there is growing evidence of the harm of long-term use of benzodiazepines, especially higher doses. Therefore, gradual reduction is recommended, titrated against withdrawal symptoms. For withdrawal purposes, stabilisation with a long-acting agent such as diazepam is recommended before commencing withdrawal. Chlordiazepoxide (Librium), a long-acting benzodiazepine, is gaining attention as an alternative to diazepam in substance abusers dependent on benzodiazepines due to its decreased abuse potential. In individuals dependent on benzodiazepines who have been using benzodiazepines long-term, taper regimens of 6–12 months have been recommended and found to be more successful. More rapid detoxifications e.g. of a month are not recommended as they lead to more severe withdrawal symptoms.|$|E

40|$|It was {{the best}} of times, it was the worst of times. [...] . So might one {{describe}} the contrasting portraits of DNA 2 ̆ 7 s ascension {{in the criminal justice system}} that are drawn in David Kaye 2 ̆ 7 s The Double Helix and the Law of Evidence and Sheldon Krimsky and Tania Simoncelli 2 ̆ 7 s Genetic Justice: DNA Data Banks, Criminal Investigations, and Civil Liberties. For Kaye, the double helix stands as the icon of twenty-first-century achievement, a science menaced primarily by the dolts (lawyers, judges, and the <b>occasional</b> analyst) who <b>misuse</b> it. For Krimsky and Simoncelli, DNA is a seductive forensic tool that is prone to overuse and best distrusted, as evidenced by swollen national data banks, shady police and laboratory practices, and unverified claims that the science has aided hundreds of thousands of investigations. Both books were written by experienced DNA insiders. Krimsky, a Tufts University professor and bioethics expert, and Simoncelli, formerly the Science Advisor at the American Civil Liberties Union, were both active participants in early academic and policy debates around DNA databasing. So too was Kaye, a professor at Penn State University, who has served on a number of government committees devoted to DNA methods and who has also aided defense lawyers in an assortment of cases. So whose picture is right...|$|R
500|$|Despite the {{critical}} acclaim, not all reviews were as positive. Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote that [...] "for {{a movie about}} the power of imagination, Bridge to Terabithia is not as clever as you would hope". Puig called the film a [...] "serviceable translation" [...] of the novel, but thought the adult characters were caricatured. The reviewer found the real-life portions of the movie were [...] "derivative and simplistic", but found Jess's emotional tumult felt [...] "powerfully authentic, and this is where the film finds its truth and soul". The Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern felt that despite the <b>occasional</b> <b>misuse</b> of enchantment—"brief spasms of overproduced fantasy"—the novel's screen adaptation was told with [...] "agreeable simplicity in between computer-generated monsters". Morgenstern was disappointed with the performances by the young members of the cast, which he described as [...] "appealing but unpolished". Morgenstern thought Csupó lacked experience directing actors, and that although Deschanel was the best adult performer, she seemed self-directed. Entertainment Weeklys Gregory Kirschling was confused by the main characters' lack of excitement towards Terabithia, and felt the film could not decide if it was [...] "a fantasy or a coming-of-age story".|$|E
6000|$|THOMAS CHATTERTON (1752-1770). This [...] "marvelous boy," [...] to whom Keats {{dedicated}} his [...] "Endymion," [...] and who {{is celebrated}} in Shelley's [...] "Adonais," [...] {{is one of the}} saddest and most interesting figures of the romantic revival. During his childhood he haunted the old church of St. Mary Redcliffe, in Bristol, where he was fascinated by the mediæval air of the place, and especially by one old chest, known as Canynge's coffer, containing musty documents which had been preserved for three hundred years. With strange, uncanny intentness the child pored over these relics of the past, copying them instead of his writing book, until he could imitate not only the spelling and language but even the handwriting of the original. Soon after the [...] "Ossian" [...] forgeries appeared, Chatterton began to produce documents, apparently very old, containing mediæval poems, legends, and family histories, centering around two characters,--Thomas Rowley, priest and poet, and William Canynge, merchant of Bristol in the days of Henry VI. It seems incredible that the whole design of these mediæval romances should have been worked out by a child of eleven, and that he could reproduce the style and the writing of Caxton's day so well that the printers were deceived; but such is the fact. More and more Rowley Papers, as they were called, were produced by Chatterton,--apparently from the archives of the old church; in reality from his own imagination,--delighting a large circle of readers, and deceiving all but Gray and a few scholars who recognized the <b>occasional</b> <b>misuse</b> of fifteenth-century English words. All this work was carefully finished, and bore the unmistakable stamp of literary genius. Reading now his [...] "Ælla," [...] or the [...] "Ballad of Charite," [...] or the long poem in ballad style called [...] "Bristowe Tragedie," [...] it is hard to realize that it is a boy's work. At seventeen years of age Chatterton went for a literary career to London, where he soon afterwards took poison and killed himself in a fit of childish despondency, brought on by poverty and hunger.|$|E

50|$|The {{collective}} {{persecution of}} the gendarmerie had severe consequences for its members. Thousands {{of them were}} killed, tortured, beaten to death, imprisoned, sent to work camps famous for brutal treatments and at best, became marginalized in society, not finding work, nor receiving any state benefits (health care, retirement benefits, etc.). Even their children were barred from higher education. The few cases of claimed mistreatment of the Jews {{at the hands of}} the gendarmes cannot be compared to the brutality with which the ÁVO treated the gendarmes; and the AVO did that not only by <b>occasional</b> <b>misuse</b> of power, but in every case and by order. Persecution was the fate of all gendarmes, including those who had already retired before the war began and those who were at the front lines, never having anything to do with the deportations, and even those who themselves were known to have helped the Jews. Only a very few gendarmes were able to continue to serve under the communist government, but eventually they, too, were executed. After the 1989 fall of communism, the Constitutional Court judged the collective verdict against the Gendarmerie unconstitutional, and against modern law to persecute any person who himself did not participate in any criminal acts. The Court also found the verdict of 1945 unconstitutional because it dissolved an organization which was not created for the purpose of causing harm to others (like the SS was, for example), but rather to protect and aid the safety of others, a task which they indeed carried out with distinction for over six decades.|$|E
