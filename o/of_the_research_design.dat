50|$|Although archeologists {{studied the}} site and the remains for almost a dozen years, critics of the {{construction}} project believed GSA's original archeological research design was inadequate, as it did not require {{a plan for the}} treatment of uncovered remains. In addition, the African-descendant community in New York City was not consulted in the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>design,</b> nor were any archaeologists who had experience studying the African diaspora, although GSA had distributed the EIS to more than 200 state and local agencies and stakeholders, many recommended by the city.

50|$|A {{research}} design is a framework or blueprint for conducting the marketing research project. It details the procedures necessary for obtaining the required information, and {{its purpose is}} to design a study that will test the hypotheses of interest, determine possible answers to the research questions, and provide the information needed for decision making. Conducting exploratory research, precisely defining the variables, and designing appropriate scales to measure them are also a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>design.</b> The issue of how the data should {{be obtained from the}} respondents (for example, by conducting a survey or an experiment) must be addressed. It is also necessary to design a questionnaire and a sampling plan to select respondents for the study.|$|E
50|$|A journal club is a {{group of}} {{individuals}} who meet regularly (in person, online, or both) to critically evaluate recent articles in the academic literature, such as the scientific literature, medical literature, or philosophy literature. Journal clubs are usually organized around a defined subject in basic or applied research. For example, the application of evidence-based medicine to some area of medical practice can be facilitated by a journal club. Typically, each participant can voice their view relating to several questions such as the appropriateness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>design,</b> the statistics employed, the appropriateness of the controls that were used, etc. There might be an attempt to synthesize together the results of several papers, even if some of these results might first appear to contradict each other. Even if {{the results of the study}} are seen as valid, there might be a discussion of how useful the results are and if these results might lead to new research or to new applications.|$|E

A critical analysis is given on how quality attributes associated with Maillard reaction can be predicted and controlled by kinetic modelling. Multiresponse modelling (taking more than one reactant and product into consideration in the modelling process) is a powerful tool to model complicated consecutive and parallel reactions, like the Maillard reaction. Such a multiresponse approach provides a major guidance in understanding the reaction mechanism. An illustrative example is given...|$|R
