500|$|Thinner {{than most}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>men</b> who have portrayed Edna, Travolta {{appeared}} onscreen {{in a large}} fat suit, and required four hours of makeup in order {{to appear before the}} cameras. His character's nimble dancing style belies her girth; Shankman based Edna's dancing style on the hippo ballerinas in the Dance of the Hours sequence in Walt Disney's 1940 animated feature, Fantasia. Although early versions of the suit created [...] "a dumpy, Alfred Hitchcock version of Edna," [...] Travolta fought for the ability to give his character curves and a thick Baltimore accent. Designed by Tony Gardner, the fat suit was created using lightweight synthetic materials, consisting of layered pads and silicone, which was used from the chest upwards. The suit provided the additional benefit of covering Travolta's beard, eliminating the problem of his facial hair growing through his makeup midday.|$|E

En route, however, he and his party were strafed by low-flying German {{aircraft}}, forcing the paratroopers to dive for cover; when the aircraft had departed Hill stood up again, finding that he had been wounded in the buttocks and the officer next to him had been killed. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>men</b> had either been killed or wounded during the attack, leaving only himself and the commander of his headquarters defence platoon; once first aid had been administered to the wounded, Hill continued on and finally managed reach Ranville, where the headquarters of the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Major-General Gale, had been set up. After being informed by Gale that his brigade had successfully completed its objectives, Hill had his wound tended to, and then travelled to his own headquarters; there he found Lieutenant Colonel Pearson in temporary command, who informed him that many the brigade's staff had been killed during the drop. By 00:00 on the night of 6/7 June, the entire division was fully deployed on the eastern flank of the invasion beaches.

One man, who wore an orthopedic shoe, complained loudly, just before takeoff, that he needed to switch seats.
