2500|$|Within {{emergency}} medical services a medical director is a physician who provides guidance, leadership, oversight and continuous quality improvement (CQI) {{for the practice of}} local EMTs and paramedics within a predefined area. [...] In North America, medical directors are typically board-certified in emergency medicine or pediatric emergency medicine. [...] The medical director is generally responsible for either the creation of protocols for treatment by prehospital providers or providing leadership to the group of physicians who assist with the provision of medical oversight depending on which model <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> and which model of medical control are operating. The medical director may also assist the EMS agency in extending its scope of practice (where applicable by law). [...] While this definition is a fair description of the role in North America, significant variations can occur in other countries and in other health care systems.|$|E
2500|$|Air {{ambulance}} {{services in the}} United States can be operated {{by a variety of}} sources.

[...] Such services may be operated directly by any of these EMS systems, or they may be contracted to a third-party provider, such as an aircraft charter company. [...] In addition, {{it is not uncommon for}} U.S. military helicopters to be pressed into service providing air ambulance support. [...] The vast distances covered by the U.S. mean that while helicopters may be the preferred form <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> for 'on-scene' emergencies, fixed wing aircraft, including small jets, are often used for transfers from rural hospitals to tertiary care sites. [...] These aircraft are typically staffed by a mix of personnel including physicians, nurses, and paramedics, and in some cases, by all three. [...] Publicly operated air ambulance service is supplemented by emergency and non-emergency air transport service, which may be provided by dedicated air ambulance companies, or by aircraft charter companies as a 'sideline' business operation. Air Ambulance companies are not all considered the same. Some are brokers that farm-out the air medical transports other are highly accredited by accrediting organizations like CAMTS.|$|E

The shape <b>of</b> electronic <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> in social housing was found to be heavily influenced by the high complexity of transactions between social landlords and tenants, and by the ethos of some social landlords. The research also suggested there was a broad consensus between social landlords and tenants with regard to the practical limits <b>of</b> online <b>services.</b> However, the development of this form <b>of</b> electronic <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> was occurring in a situation in which influence was unevenly divided between the various parties involved...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This paper {{reports on}} models <b>of</b> health <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> in remote or {{isolated}} areas of Queensland. Background: There is little research that investigates current models <b>of</b> health <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> in remote or isolated areas of Australia. Design: A multiple case study research design was employed that included interviews and focus groups. Setting: Three types {{of health care}} facilities in remote or isolated Queensland. Subjects: Thirty five registered nurses. Results: Findings indicated that nurses and Indigenous health workers are predominantly resident and provide health services in this environment, while medical and allied health care services are usually provided by non‑resident visiting specialists. Conclusions: Findings suggest that {{meeting the needs of}} communities in remote and isolated areas of Queensland requires a change in the focus <b>of</b> health <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> to accommodate a primary health care philosophy. The introduction of a new model <b>of</b> health <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> is recommended; however this will only occur if resources are harnessed to prepare staff to reprioritise services offered.

Study setting:  Sixteen skilled nursing facilities. Study design:  Prospective study, comparing three consecutive cohorts. Data collection:  Professionals (elderly care physicians, physiotherapists and nursing staff) rated four domains <b>of</b> health <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> at admission and at discharge of 1075 patients. In addition, these patients [median age 79 (Interquartile range 71 – 85) years, 63 % females] and their informal caregivers rated their experiences on these domains 4 weeks after discharge. Principal findings:  During the three consecutive cohorts, professionals reported improvement on the domain team cooperation, including assessment for intensive treatment and information transfer among professionals. Fewer improvements were reported within the domains alignment with patients’ needs, care coordination and care quality. Between the cohorts, according to patients (n  = 521) and informal caregivers (n  = 319) there were no {{changes in the}} four domains <b>of</b> health <b>service</b> <b>delivery.</b> Conclusion:  This national programme resulted in small improvements in team cooperation {{as reported by the}} professionals.
