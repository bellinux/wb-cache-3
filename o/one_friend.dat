5|$|Balzac {{suffered}} from health problems throughout his life, possibly {{due to his}} intense writing schedule. His relationship with his family was often strained by financial and personal drama, and he lost more than <b>one</b> <b>friend</b> over critical reviews. In 1850, Balzac married Ewelina Hańska, a Polish aristocrat and his longtime love; he died in Paris five months later.|$|E

25|$|Based {{upon the}} reports of {{teachers}} and mothers, 75% of preschool children had at least <b>one</b> <b>friend.</b> This figure rose to 78% through the fifth grade, as measured by co-nomination as friends, and 55% had a mutual best friend. About 15% of children {{were found to be}} chronically friendless, reporting periods without mutual friends at least six months.|$|E
5000|$|And now {{we shall}} {{speak about the}} love of God. First, one should know that love is {{acquired}} through deeds. By giving presents to <b>one's</b> <b>friend,</b> each and every gift one gives to <b>one's</b> <b>friend</b> is like an arrow and a bullet that pierces a hole in <b>one's</b> <b>friend's</b> heart. And although <b>one's</b> <b>friend's</b> heart is like a stone, each and every bullet still punctures a hole, and from the many holes, a space is made. Then, {{the love of the}} giver of the presents enters within that space, and the warmth of the love attracts to it the sparks of love of <b>one's</b> <b>friend.</b> Thus, from two loves, a clothing of love is made, and this clothing covers them both.

50|$|The {{hypothesis}} implies roughly that {{attitudes of}} the group members will tend to change {{in such a way}} that <b>one's</b> friends' <b>friends</b> will tend to become <b>one's</b> <b>friends</b> and <b>one's</b> enemies' enemies also <b>one’s</b> <b>friends,</b> and <b>one's</b> enemies' <b>friends</b> and <b>one's</b> friends' enemies will tend to become one's enemies, and moreover, that these changes tend to operate even across several removes (one's friends' friends' enemies' enemies tend become friends by an iterative process).|$|R
25|$|Throughout 1991, {{friends and}} {{associates}} noted that Donati had become less outgoing and visibly anxious. He stayed home more often. In August he told <b>one</b> <b>friend</b> that he'd noticed two men wearing black jogging outfits near the house he was renting on Mountain Avenue in Revere, apparently tracking his movements, and believed they were preparing to make an attempt on his life.|$|E

500|$|On Saturday, February 17, 1940, Goldman {{suffered}} a debilitating stroke. She became paralyzed {{on her right}} side, and although her hearing was unaffected, she could not speak. As <b>one</b> <b>friend</b> described it: [...] "Just to think that here was Emma, the greatest orator in America, unable to utter one word." [...] For three months she improved slightly, receiving visitors and on one occasion gesturing to her address book to signal that a friend might find friendly contacts {{during a trip to}} Mexico. She {{suffered a}}nother stroke on May 8, however, and on May 14 she died in Toronto, aged 70.|$|E

By coming out to watch <b>one's</b> <b>friend's</b> team play a match, one is likely not {{directly}} supporting their team in any significant way (especially if there is no charge to attend), but <b>one's</b> <b>friend</b> may still feel encouraged by the moral support of one's presence.|$|R
500|$|During {{this period}} Chatwin {{travelled}} extensively {{for his job}} and also for adventure. Travel offered him a relief from the British class system, which he found stifling. An admirer of Robert Byron and his book, The Road to Oxiana, he travelled twice to Afghanistan. He also used these trips to visit markets and shops where he would buy antiques which he would resell at a profit in order to supplement his income from Sotheby's. He became friends with artists and art collectors and dealers. <b>One</b> <b>friend,</b> Howard Hodgkin, painted Chatwin in The Japanese Screen (1962).

500|$|Lowell's {{sudden death}} in 1916 {{temporarily}} halted {{the search for}} PlanetX. Failing to find the planet, according to <b>one</b> <b>friend,</b> [...] "virtually killed him". Lowell's widow, Constance, engaged in a legal battle with the observatory over Lowell's legacy which halted the search for PlanetX for several years. In 1925, the observatory obtained glass discs for a new [...] wide-field telescope to continue the search, constructed with funds from Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Percival's brother. In 1929 the observatory's director, Vesto Melvin Slipher, summarily handed the job of locating the planet to Clyde Tombaugh, a 22-year-old Kansas farm boy who had only just arrived at the Lowell Observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings.|$|E
500|$|Morgan met {{his first}} wife in Kent in the early 1980s. They married in 1982, but he left her when she became {{pregnant}} with twins. He met another woman after moving to Dorset. She also became pregnant, giving birth to a son, and they married in 1994, after living together for several years. Morgan {{had a reputation as}} a womaniser, seducing customers while working as an engineer. He continued this activity after becoming a lorry driver. Following Morgan's conviction, brother Ray Morgan said, [...] "He has had so many affairs over the years I have lost count." [...] He also had a violent temper. <b>One</b> <b>friend,</b> Dave Moemken, described him as being [...] "on a short fuse".|$|E

[...] She was running from the killer when she fell down the well. [...] Anya promises to find Emily's killer, while Emily agrees to help Anya fit in at school and win over Sean.

500|$|The {{two friends}} {{confirmed}} to the Post that they remembered meeting Jackie {{on the night}} of the incident, that she was distraught but not visibly injured or bloodied, and that details she provided then were different from those in the Rolling Stone article. <b>One</b> <b>friend,</b> Ryan Duffin (called [...] "Randall" [...] in the Rolling Stone article), told The Washington Post that he had never spoken to any reporter from Rolling Stone, although Erdely had claimed him as a source to corroborate the accuser's story. Sandra Menendez, a student who claimed to have been interviewed by Erdely but who was not directly quoted in the article, told CNN that she and others became uncomfortable after speaking with Erdely, concluding she had [...] "an agenda".|$|E
500|$|Dickinson was {{familiar}} {{not only with}} the Bible but also with contemporary popular literature. She was probably influenced by Lydia Maria Child's Letters from New York, another gift from Newton (after reading it, she gushed [...] "This then is a book! And there are more of them!"). Her brother smuggled a copy of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Kavanagh into the house for her (because her father might disapprove) and a friend lent her Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre in late 1849. Jane Eyres influence cannot be measured, but when Dickinson acquired her first and only dog, a Newfoundland, she named him [...] "Carlo" [...] after the character St. John Rivers' dog. William Shakespeare was also a potent influence in her life. Referring to his plays, she wrote to <b>one</b> <b>friend,</b> [...] "Why clasp any hand but this?"

[...] For a time, {{he was interested in}} Walter Rauschenbusch's [...] "social gospel." [...] In his third year at Morehouse, King became romantically involved with the white daughter of an immigrant German woman who worked as a cook in the cafeteria. The daughter had been involved with a professor prior to her relationship with King. King planned to marry her, but friends advised against it, saying that an interracial marriage would provoke animosity from both blacks and whites, potentially damaging his chances of ever pastoring a church in the South. King tearfully told a friend that he could not endure his mother's pain over the marriage and broke the relationship off six months later. He continued to have lingering feelings toward the women he left; <b>one</b> <b>friend</b> was quoted as saying, [...] "He never recovered." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1962, Barrett {{had taken}} {{a place at the}} Cambridge Technical College art department, where he met David Gilmour. During the winter of 1962 and early 1963, the Beatles made an impact on Barrett, and he began to play Beatles songs at parties and at picnics. In 1963, Barrett became a Rolling Stones fan and, with then-girlfriend Libby Gausden, saw them perform at a village hall in Cambridgeshire. It was at this point Barrett started writing songs; <b>one</b> <b>friend</b> recalls hearing [...] "Effervescing Elephant" [...] (later to be {{recorded}} on his solo album Barrett). Also around this time, Barrett and Gilmour occasionally played acoustic gigs together. Barrett had played bass guitar with Those Without during the summer of 1963 and both bass and guitar with The Hollerin' Blues the next summer. In 1964, Barrett and Gausden saw Bob Dylan perform. After this performance, Barrett was inspired to write [...] "Bob Dylan Blues". Barrett, now thinking about his future, decided to apply for Camberwell College of Arts in London. Barrett enrolled in the college in the summer of 1964 to study painting.|$|E
500|$|Cope was {{described}} by zoologist Henry Weed Fowler as [...] "a man of medium height and build, but always impressive with his great energy and activity". To him, Fowler wrote, [...] " [...] was both genial and always interesting, easily approachable, and both kindly and helpful." [...] Cope's affability during visits to the Academy of Natural Sciences to compare specimens was later recalled by his colleague Witmer Stone: [...] "I have often seen him busily engaged in such comparisons, all the while whistling whole passages from grand opera, or else counting the scales {{on the back of}} a lizard, while he conversed in a most amusing manner with some small street urchin who had drifted into the museum and was watching in awe with eyes and mouth wide open." [...] His self-taught nature, however, meant that he was largely hostile to bureaucracy and politics. He had a famous temper; <b>one</b> <b>friend</b> called Cope a [...] "militant paleontologist". Despite his faults, he was generally well liked by his contemporaries. American paleontologist Alfred Romer wrote that, [...] " [...] little slips from virtue were those we might make ourselves, were we bolder".|$|E

500|$|Further {{accusations of}} child sexual abuse were made in 2003, by 13-year-old Gavin Arvizo. The {{allegations}} came after Jackson and the boy appeared in the documentary Living with Michael Jackson, in which the entertainer stated that he shared his bed with children in a non-sexual fashion. The musician was subsequently indicted on four counts of molesting a minor, four counts of intoxicating a minor, one count of abduction, and one count of conspiring to hold the boy and his family captive at Neverland Ranch. During the five-month trial, Jackson faced allegations of child molestation and assertions that he had attempted to abduct the Arvizo family in a hot air balloon. He denied all the charges and family members proclaimed that he was the victim of an extortion attempt. <b>One</b> <b>friend,</b> Firpo Carr, expressed amazement at the allegations leveled against the singer, who at the time was living at Neverland Ranch. [...] "I'm surprised they haven't accused him of bestiality because he also has a zoo there. I mean, it gets ridiculous after a while." [...] On June 13, 2005, the jury found Jackson not guilty on all charges.|$|E
500|$|Johnson gained {{high office}} {{due to his}} proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and {{self-employed}} tradesmen who made up much of Tennessee's electorate. He called them the [...] "plebeians"; he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state Democratic Party, but none could match him as a vote-getter. After his death, one Tennessee voter wrote of him, [...] "Johnson {{was always the same}} to everyone... the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen." [...] Always seen in impeccably tailored clothing, he cut an impressive figure, and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate. Mostly denied the party's machinery, he relied on a network of friends, advisers, and contacts. <b>One</b> <b>friend,</b> Hugh Douglas, stated in a letter to him, [...] "you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time. At heart many of us never wanted you to be Governor only none {{of the rest of us}} Could have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use you. Then we did not want you to go to the Senate but the people would send you." ...|$|E
500|$|AJ is a mechanic, who is {{described}} as a [...] who [...] "never misses an opportunity for excitement." [...] He is characterised as a free-spirited, fun-loving and carefree rebel, who does not always realise how his spontaneity affects other people. He {{is described}} as cheeky, irresponsible, a bad influence, a joker, a charmer and a talker. It is said that he does not plan or do what people expect of him, is fun to be around and could be running away from life. A writer for the BBC said that he lives [...] "like there's no tomorrow", and makes decisions {{based on the results of}} a coin flip. The coin, described as [...] "lucky", is inspired by the Bollywood film Sholay, in which two friends make decisions based on the flip of a coin, though <b>one</b> <b>friend</b> does not know that both sides of the coin are the same. Ganatra stated in an interview on This Morning that he did not think that the two sides of AJ's coin were the same. Sharma described AJ as [...] "the clown who loves to play" [...] and [...] "a little bit of a hippy", saying [...] "he's got a real wheeler-dealer, Del Boy aspect to his character." [...] He has twice compared AJ to a puppy dog, because he is nice but annoying, and he is fun but a nuisance.
