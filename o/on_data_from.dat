5|$|The {{interaction}} {{continued to}} weaken Hilary, leaving it with little thunderstorm activity and winds of just 40mph (60km/h) on August24, before resuming a northerly motion. Around this time, Hilary finally absorbed Irwin. While Hilary began to traverse cooler waters, the environment became more favorable. Upon developing a 200 mb anticyclone, Hilary began to revive based <b>on</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> satellite imagery and ship reports. Tropical Storm Hilary made landfall in Baja California Sur on two separate occasions {{as a strong}} tropical storm on August25. Weakening over land, the cyclone regenerated deep convection over the Gulf of California. As a tropical depression, Hilary made its final landfall on August26 just west of Hermosillo in Sonora. While most of the mid to upper level moisture associated with the storm got pulled inland by a shortwave trough, the low level center dissipated in the northern Gulf on August27.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the system {{can be traced to}} a {{tropical}} depression roughly midway between the Lesser Antilles and the west coast of Africa at 1800 UTC on September 7. Though initially believed to have developed on September 11, the disturbance was found to have formed earlier in post-season reanalysis, based <b>on</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set. In its early developmental stages, the disturbance remained a tropical depression with little change in intensity. At 0600UTC on September10, it intensified into a tropical storm while still east of the Lesser Antilles. Closer to the islands, ships reported a quickly intensifying tropical cyclone with low barometric pressures, strong winds and heavy thunderstorms, although most of the activity occurred to the east of its center.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} depression quickly intensified into early on September 25 {{as the system}} continued to organize, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karen that morning. The strengthening trend was temporarily halted, and Karen remained a weak tropical storm with relatively shallow convection. Late that evening, new bursts of deep convection developed with the storm. Early on September 26, Karen intensified significantly and an inner core began to develop. That morning, a ragged eye developed and the system strengthened into a hurricane with 75mph (120km/h) winds. The intensification trend was short-lived, and the storm leveled off that afternoon as upper-level wind shear increased substantially due {{to the presence of}} a nearby tropical upper tropospheric trough. The storm became less organized that evening. Hurricane Karen weakened to a tropical storm as flight data from NOAA Hurricane Hunters confirmed surface winds of 72mph (115km/h) and a very large wind field late that evening. Operationally, Karen was classified as a strong tropical storm, but was reclassified as a Category1 hurricane based <b>on</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> the reconnaissance flight late on September 26and the less organized structure of the storm at that time.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Debra was {{the second}} of two {{tropical}} storms to hit the United States in the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season. The fourth named storm of the season, Debra developed from the interaction between a high-altitude cold low and a lower tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico. Forming on August 25, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Debra based <b>on</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> a Hurricane Hunter aircraft. As Debra approached the coast, it attained peak winds of 60mph (95km/h). The storm made landfall {{on the coast of}} Louisiana, east of the Texas border. Two deaths were caused by the storm. Debra weakened as it moved inland and ultimately dissipated on August29 over Arkansas.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Don was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall in the United States during the 2011 season. The fourth named storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Don formed from an {{area of low pressure}} along a tropical wave, Don developed into a tropical depression on July 27, and on that same day, was upgraded to tropical storm intensity, based <b>on</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> a reconnaissance aircraft noted the presence of tropical-storm-force winds. It tracked across the Gulf of Mexico and reached a peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) before moving ashore in Texas on July 30 as a tropical depression, dissipating shortly afterwards. Initially, Don was expected to provide relief to the state, which was suffering from a major drought. However, the system dissipated rapidly just before making landfall, providing very {{little in the way of}} help to the state; rainfall totals were less than 1 in (25 mm).|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Thad {{originated}} from an active monsoon trough several hundred {{miles east of}} the Philippines in mid-August1981. On August10, a weak surface circulation was first noted on satellite imagery. At that time, the center was embedded within the monsoon trough. Within five days, the system developed outflow. Midday on August15, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) first classified the system. Based <b>on</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> Hurricane Hunters, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) at 1800UTC on August15. Situated south of a subtropical ridge, the cyclone was located within a favorable environment for further development. Early on August16, the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical storm. Following an increase in organization, the JTWC upgraded the system into Tropical Depression 15 that day.|$|E
