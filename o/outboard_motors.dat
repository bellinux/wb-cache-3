5000|$|Until {{the middle}} 1950s inflatables were still rafts in {{civilian}} use, hand paddled but the <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> came into {{use in the}} early 1950s. (The <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> was invented in 1909 by Ole Evinrude.) ...|$|R
2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of the <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> the [...] "semi-dory" [...] or [...] "half-dory" [...] was developed. [...] Because typical dory bottoms are so narrow, the thrust of an <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> pushes the stern of the dory down creating a very unstable and inefficient boat. The semi-dory is basically a Swampscott dory with the stern widened and the rocker straightened aft to support the thrust of the <b>outboard</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|R
50|$|The transom slopes back at {{an angle}} of about 45 degrees with the top edge sloping forward giving drascombes a {{distinctive}} appearance at the stern. Just forward of the transom is a well to take an <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> with a slot in the transom that allows the <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> to be tilted {{out of the water}} when under sail. It also keeps the <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> hidden from view.|$|R
25|$|Whiting carried two 29-foot (8.8-meter) aluminum-hulled {{diesel-powered}} Jensen survey launches. For {{utility and}} rescue purposes, she also carried two open boats with gasoline-powered <b>outboard</b> <b>motors,</b> a 16-foot (4.9-meter) Boston Whaler fiberglass-hulled boat and 17-foot (5.2-meter) Monark aluminum-hulled boat.|$|E
25|$|Peirce carried two 29-foot (8.8-meter) aluminum-hulled {{diesel-powered}} Jensen survey launches, each {{equipped with}} the same Hydrochart system as aboard Peirce.

25|$|David Starr Jordan had a {{helicopter}} platform, {{allowing her to}} host {{a helicopter}} for aerial observations and photographic survey missions. She carried three boats, an 18.5-foot (5.5-meter) Zodiac rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB), an 18-foot (5.4-meter) Avon RHIB, and a 12-foot (3.7-meter) Boston Whaler fiberglass-hulled boat. All three boats were powered by gasoline <b>outboard</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|E

25|$|Wisconsin {{is home to}} a {{very large}} and diversified {{manufacturing}} economy, with special focus on transportation and capital equipment. Major Wisconsin companies in these categories include the Kohler Company; Mercury Marine; Rockwell Automation; Johnson Controls; John Deere; Briggs & Stratton; Milwaukee Electric Tool Company; Caterpillar Inc.; Joy Global; Oshkosh Corporation; Harley-Davidson; Case IH; S. C. Johnson & Son; Ashley Furniture; Ariens; and Evinrude <b>Outboard</b> <b>Motors.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kerosene {{is widely}} used to power jet engines of {{aircraft}} (jet fuel) and some rocket engines and is also commonly used as a cooking and lighting fuel and for fire toys such as poi. In parts of Asia, kerosene is sometimes used as fuel for small <b>outboard</b> <b>motors</b> or even motorcycles. World total kerosene consumption for all purposes is equivalent to about 1.2 million barrels per day.|$|E
25|$|A pirogue is a small, {{flat-bottomed}} boat of {{a design}} associated particularly with West African fishermen and the Cajuns of the Louisiana marsh. These are usually dugouts, and are light and {{small enough to}} be easily taken onto land. The design allows the pirogue {{to move through the}} very shallow water of marshes and be easily turned over to drain any water that may get into the boat. The pirogue is usually propelled by paddles with one blade. It can also be punted with a push pole in shallow water. Small sails can also be used. <b>Outboard</b> <b>motors</b> are increasingly being used in many regions.|$|E
50|$|Evinrude {{was born}} in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Bess and Ole Evinrude. Evinrude's father had emigrated from Norway in 1882 and had {{developed}} the first commercially feasible <b>outboard</b> <b>motor,</b> thus creating a new industry and form of recreation. In 1927, Evinrude joined the family firm, Elto <b>Outboard</b> <b>Motor</b> Company after two years at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Ole Evinrude died on July 12, 1934 and Ralph Evinrude took over running the company. In 1936, Elto <b>Outboard</b> <b>Motor</b> Company merged with Waukegan, Illinois-based Johnson Motor Company to form Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC).|$|R

25|$|Baits and lures are {{typically}} trolled at {{speeds up to}} 9 knots, though speeds up to 15 knots can be used, particularly when boats are travelling to different fishing areas. The speed at which the lure is pulled through the water impacts on the fishing success. The optimum trolling speed varies with different species of fish, with weather conditions {{and the time of}} year, and other conditions. Chinook salmon can be successfully trolled at higher speeds than more docile lake trout. For these reasons fishermen use devices that accurately track speed. Trolling motors calibrate speed more accurately than large <b>outboard</b> <b>motors.</b> Trolling plates are also used with larger motors to slow the boat to the desired speed, although some anglers experience mixed results with plates.|$|E
25|$|According to Arthur Ahkinga, {{who lived}} on Little Diomede island {{at the turn of}} the 1940s, the Iñupiat on the island made their living by hunting and carving ivory which they traded or sold. Fish they caught were bullheads, tomcods, bluecods and a few others, {{although}} the fishing was not so common. During the winter time they used fur parkas and skin mukluks made out of hunted animals to protect themselves from cold and wind. Recreations were skating, snowshoeing, handball, football and Inuit dancing. After dark, people spent the rest of the evening telling jokes and old-time stories. In summer time they travelled with skin boats equipped with <b>outboard</b> <b>motors</b> to either Siberia or Wales, Alaska. Winter travel was limited to neighboring Big Diomede due to weather conditions. Between July and October half the population went to Nome for selling their carving and skin sewing and trading for supplies.|$|E
500|$|Mail {{was picked}} up twice daily at the {{railroad}} station for the Duluth and Iron Range Railroad (later the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railroad) erroneously named [...] "Elcore". Later, the Elcor Mercantile diversified into the up-and-coming petroleum business, selling Conoco gasoline, kerosene, fuel oils, motor oils, grease and even <b>outboard</b> <b>motors.</b> Concrete sidewalks were built to line the shady streets, and bright red fire hydrants were installed. Homes were insulated, and people began to purchase refrigerators. Manilla Street and Maritana Avenue were paved. Greyhound Bus Lines established {{a stop at the}} Elcor Mercantile. A baseball team was entered in the old East Mesaba League, and the Elcor Mercantile sponsored the Elcor-Conocos, an ice-hockey team that became one of the best on the Iron Range. Chicago Blackhawks ice-hockey goaltender Sam LoPresti was born in Elcor.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2013 seven new [...] "class 4" [...] Rigid-hulled {{inflatable}} boat watercraft were rolled {{out across the}} state to Balmain, Botany Bay and broken Broken Bay.
