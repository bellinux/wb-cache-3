25|$|Joint {{service with}} the Long Island Rail Road's Atlantic Branch existed between Norwood Avenue and Crescent Street {{stations}} with a connection built at Chestnut Street in Brooklyn.

As a consequence of this new trans-national freight network an additional change was made to the original legislation which required train safety and <b>operating</b> <b>standards</b> to be set out clearly and administered by an organisation that did not run commercial services. The directive also required separate accounting of freight and passenger service revenues and costs.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Drowning {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of death in children. Resuscitating a child {{following}} submersion is a highpressure situation, and <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> procedures can reduce error. Currently, the Resuscitation Council UK guidance does not include a <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> procedure on paediatric drowning. The objective of this project was to design a <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> procedure to improve outcomes of drowned children. Methods: A literature review on the management of paediatric drowning was conducted. Relevant publications were used to develop a <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> procedure for management of paediatric drowning. Results: A concise <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> procedure was developed for resuscitation following paediatric submersion. Specific recommendations include: the Heimlich manoeuvre should not be used in this context; however, prolonged resuscitation and therapeutic hypothermia are recommended. Conclusions: This <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> procedure is a potentially useful adjunct to the Resuscitation Council UK guidance and should be considered for incorporation into its next iteration...|$|R
