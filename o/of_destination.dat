5|$|Hergé also {{inserted}} a cameo of Jacobs into the story, using {{him as the}} basis for a scientist that appears on page 40 <b>of</b> <b>Destination</b> Moon, a nod to Jacobs' inclusion of a reference to Hergé in one of his Blake and Mortimer mysteries, The Mystery of the Great Pyramid (1954).|$|E
5|$|Hergé had {{developed}} {{the idea of}} setting an Adventure of Tintin on the moon while producing Prisoners of the Sun. He began serialisation <b>of</b> <b>Destination</b> Moon, {{the first of a}} two part arc followed by Explorers on the Moon, in Tintin magazine in March 1950. In September 1950, Hergé broke off the story, feeling the need for a break from work, having fallen back into clinical depression. He and Germaine went on holiday to Gland before returning to Brussels in late September. Many readers sent letters to Tintin asking why Explorers on the Moon was no longer being serialised, with a rumour emerging that Hergé had died. Explorers of the Moon would resume after an eighteen month hiatus, returning in April 1952.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} in December 2007 that Destination X was planned to be held on March 16 outside of the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida. However, in January 2008 TNA announced that Destination X would be held on March 9 instead. TNA issued a press release in mid-January 2008 stating that Destination X would {{be held at the}} Norfolk Scope in Norfolk, Virginia on March 9, 2008. Tickets for the event went on sale January 25, 2008. In Demand listed a preview <b>of</b> <b>Destination</b> X in late-January 2008 promoting the return of the Elevation X match. TNA released a poster featuring The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin; MCMG) sometime prior to help promote the event. The song Life Story by the band Crash Anthem was used as the official theme for the show.|$|E

40|$|Many {{next-generation}} distributed applications, such as grid computing, {{require a}} single source {{to communicate with}} a group <b>of</b> <b>destinations.</b> Traditionally, such applications are implemented using multicast communication. A typical multicast session requires creating the shortest-path tree to a fixed number <b>of</b> <b>destinations.</b> The fundamental issue in multicasting data to a fixed set <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> is receiver blocking. If one <b>of</b> the <b>destinations</b> is not reachable, the entire multicast request (say, grid task request) may fail. Manycasting is a generalized variation of multicasting that provides {{the freedom to choose}} the best subset <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> from a larger set <b>of</b> candidate <b>destinations.</b> We propose an impairment-aware algorithm to provide manycasting service in the optical layer, specifically OBS. We compare the performance of our proposed manycasting algorithm with traditional multicasting and multicast with over provisioning. Our results show a significant improvement in the blocking probability by implementing optical-layer manycasting...|$|R

25|$|Several peoples saw a {{much larger}} {{decrease}} than {{can be explained by}} the low fertility rates and high mortality rates in Russia during the past two decades. Emigration and assimilation contributed to the decrease in numbers of many peoples. Emigration was the most important factor for Germans, Jews and Baltic peoples (Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians). The number of Germans halved between 1959 and 2010. Their main country <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> is Germany.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{representatives from}} both {{countries}} met in Delhi, {{and planned to}} enhance tourism through collaboration in the spheres <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> management and promotion, {{as well as in}} manpower development.

25|$|Apart {{from the}} field of {{evolutionary}} biology, the concept of a fitness landscape has also gained importance in evolutionary optimization methods such as genetic algorithms or evolution strategies. In evolutionary optimization, one tries to solve real-world problems (e.g., engineering or logistics problems) by imitating the dynamics of biological evolution. For example, a delivery truck with a number <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> addresses can take a large variety of different routes, but only very few will result in a short driving time.|$|E

25|$|After WCW {{was sold}} in 2001, Falkinburg signed with the WWF where he made his {{pay-per-view}} debut in the main event of July's Invasion show, {{and went on to}} become a one-time WWF European Champion and one-time WWF World Tag Team Champion. Due to a series of injuries, he allowed his contract with the company to expire in 2002.

25|$|In {{order to}} use {{evolutionary}} optimization, {{one has to}} define for every possible solution s {{to the problem of}} interest (i.e., every possible route {{in the case of the}} delivery truck) how 'good' it is. This is done by introducing a scalar-valued function f(s) (scalar valued means that f(s) is a simple number, such as 0.3, while s can be a more complicated object, for example a list <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> addresses in the case of the delivery truck), which is called the fitness function.|$|E
25|$|Belarus and Russia {{had been}} {{collecting}} a Value added tax (VAT), meant {{to finance the}} Union State, {{in the country of}} origin, but from 1 January 2005, VAT is collected in the country <b>of</b> <b>destination,</b> as in most other independent countries of the world. This change gave rise to a considerable degree of confusion and has disrupted many trade operations between Belarus and Russia. On 10 February 2005, private entrepreneurs in Belarus staged a one-day warning strike, protesting the new VAT scheme between the two countries and Lukashenko's economic policies.|$|E

25|$|Cali {{is served}} by over 20 coach {{companies}} which gather in the Central Bus Station. The Station is centrally located near the old (now redundant) railway station, which serves now as Metrocali's headquarters. Depending on {{the company and the}} destination, the vehicles range from minibuses to large coaches. Recently, in their last float renovation wave, Colombian coaches operators have opted for Brazil's Marcopolo buses. Informal stops exist for the short destination rides all along the way from Central Station to the town <b>of</b> <b>destination.</b> In some cases, it is enough for a passenger to ask to get off the bus for the bus to stop.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the possibility of}} single workers infecting partners in their home communities, migrant couples are also at a high risk of infection. In many cases, it was actually the female partner who stayed in the home community who was HIV-positive. Several possible policy interventions exist. First, employers in the area <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> should provide more family-friendly housing instead of single-sex hostels. Second, dealing with the more fundamental aspect of the issue, rural development should be encouraged. If the conditions in the home community were to be altered and improved, there would be less need for the men to seek temporary employment in urban areas in the first place.|$|E
25|$|On 23 June 2016, the British {{electorate}} {{voted to}} leave the European Union in a nationwide referendum in England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar. The UK sent notification of their intention {{to leave the}} EU to the European Council through Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. After notifying the European Council, the UK has two years to negotiate with other member states until it leaves, and British citizens will only then cease to be citizens of the European Union. British citizens will still have the right of freedom of movement until the UK formally leaves. It has since been suggested that British citizens wishing to travel to EU countries may have {{to apply for a}} visa or apply online for an American style ESTA visa waiver and pay a fee in order to enter the country <b>of</b> <b>destination.</b>|$|E

25|$|Another {{issue to}} {{consider}} is {{the freedom of the}} migrants. Some scholars have questioned whether these workers are moving into a state of “unfreedom”. Recruitment into circular migration may involve false promises and deception, leading to forced labor and debt bondage. Migrants have varying degrees of control concerning the choice and circumstances of migration, thus making the distinction between voluntary and forced migration unclear. Once in their destination country, migrants are sometimes met with abusive treatment, inadequate nutrition, poor lodging, and insufficient food. These factors are unlikely to bring a worker back to that area, thus discouraging circular migration. This dishonest recruitment leads {{to the question of whether}} the migrants are marginalized. Circular migrants are marginal in the area <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> in the sense that their true home is back in their home area, and they do not plan on living in the host area permanently.|$|E
25|$|The MPS also {{supports}} mail delivery for U.S. diplomatic facilities overseas and to deployed personnel in combat zones worldwide. Most USPS extra services, such as Certified Mail, registered mail, delivery confirmation, insured mail, certificate of mailing, return receipt, restricted delivery and return receipt for merchandise {{are available to}} the MPS. Mail sent from one military post office (MPO) to another MPO can be sent for free as inner/intra-theater delivery service (IDS) {{as long as it}} does not transit the United States. Military postage rates are equivalent to U.S. domestic postage rates because the Services pay the second destination transportation (SDT) costs to, from, and between MPOs. The postage paid on mail to/from MPOs only covers the cost of transporting the mail within the U.S. All military mail between the U.S. and overseas locations is subject to customs inspection in the country <b>of</b> <b>destination,</b> and customs declarations must normally be attached to packages and larger mail pieces.|$|E
25|$|Coming from Buenos Aires without {{documents}} or license with a contraband of lingerie {{the ship}} was captured by the Spaniards in Coquimbo but this capture was not informed to the Spanish Navy in Callao. The ship with the new crew sailed to then Spanish Valparaíso and refitted as a 50-gun ship and was put {{under the command of}} Spanish Captain José Anacleto Goñi and manned with 50 Chileans (in Spanish originarios). The next time {{the ship was}} seen in Paita in November 1816 and few days later sailed, allegedly, to the port <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> Galápagos. The Spanish commandant of Callao, , was informed from Paita about this new ship in his naval division, but due to the circumstances he mistrusted Captain Goñi and his crew. Moreover, he learned that the real destination of the ship was Panama City. Consequently, he ordered the commandants of the ports of Guayaquil and Paita to replace Goñi with a trustworthy captain, to man the ship with at least 2/3 Spaniards (in Spanish europeos) and to send the ship immediately to Callao on its return from Panama.|$|E
