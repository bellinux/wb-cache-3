Early social scientists first identified elderspeak and estimated that 20% {{of the communication}} occurring in nursing homes is actually elderspeak (Caporael, 1981). Caretakers of nursing home residents must be particularly careful when using elderspeak. Although elderspeak {{has been shown to}} help older adults with dementia and Alzheimer’s in language comprehension, they are not immune to feeling disrespected when it is used. Resisting care is an ongoing problem with dementia patients, as well as violent behaviour, and residents <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> are more likely to resist care when their nurse uses elderspeak. Care givers may assume that the elder prefers the nurturing of elderspeak but older adults think of it as demeaning. Older adults in both institutional settings and those receiving home care services report that as many as 40% of their caregivers use speech they perceive as demeaning, and 75% of the interactions that elderly people have are with the staff of the nursing homes.|$|E

The first purpose is to utilize a new methodology (Bayesian networks) for aggregating various quality indicators to measure the overall quality <b>of</b> care in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes.</b> The second is to provide new insight into the relationships that exist among various measures of quality and how such measures affect the overall quality <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> care as measured by the Observable Indicators <b>of</b> <b>Nursing</b> <b>Home</b> Care Quality Instrument. In contrast to many methods used for the same purpose, our method yields both qualitative and quantitative insight into <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> care quality. Design and Methods: We construct several Bayesian networks to study the influences among factors associated with the quality <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> care; we compare and measure their accuracy against other predictive models. Results: We find the best Bayesian network to perform better than other commonly used methods. We also identify key factors, including number <b>of</b> certified <b>nurse</b> assistant hours, prevalence of bedfast residents, and prevalence of daily physical restraints, that significantly affect the quality <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> care. Furthermore, the results of our analysis identify their probabilistic relationships.

Objective: We sought to investigate the relationship between inappro-priate medications in older adults and transitions to <b>nursing</b> <b>home.</b> Methods: A retrospective cohort of Medicare beneficiaries with employer-sponsored supplemental health insurance was analyzed using a longitudinal data set of Medicare supplemental insurance claims. After a baseline year with no <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> admissions, subjects were followed until the first month <b>of</b> transition to <b>nursing</b> <b>home,</b> loss to follow-up, {{or the end of}} the 24 -month follow-up period.

Results: Of the 487, 383 subjects in the cohort, 22, 042 (4. 5 %) had a <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> admission. Use <b>of</b> inappropriate drugs was associated with a 31 % increase in risk <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> admission, compared with no use of inappropriate drugs (adjusted relative risk 1. 31, 99 % confidence interval CI 1. 26 – 1. 36).

Results: The <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> share <b>of</b> total Medicaid LTC expenditures was positively associated with female labor force participation, and negatively associated with those aged 85 and over, Hispanics, Medicare home health users, Cash and Counseling programs, and democratic governors. Rates <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> utilization were positively associated with poverty rates, <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> beds, and personal care state plan options, and negatively associated with spending on Medicaid home- and community-based services (HCBS). Rates <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> expenditures were positively associated with those aged 65 to 84, Hispanics, per capita incomes, <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> beds, and Real Choice System Change grants, and negatively associated with female labor force participation, poverty rates, HCBS spending, and democratic governors. Implications: Factors that may be amenable to policy intervention aimed at rebalancing the nation's LTC system include <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> supply restriction and Medicaid program policy.
