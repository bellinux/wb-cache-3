2500|$|From the 1960s to the 1980s, {{alcohol was}} {{commonly}} {{used as a}} tocolytic, a method to stop preterm labor. The method originated with Dr. Fritz Fuchs, {{the chairman of the}} department of <b>obstetrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>gynecology</b> <b>at</b> Cornell University Medical College. Doctors recommended a small amount of alcohol to calm the uterus during contractions in early pregnancy or Braxton Hicks contractions. In later stages of pregnancy, the alcohol was administered intravenously and often in large amounts. [...] "Women experienced similar effects as occur with oral ingestion, including intoxication, nausea and vomiting, and potential alcohol poisoning, followed by hangovers when the alcohol was discontinued." [...] Vomiting put the mother at a high risk for aspiration and was [...] "a brutal procedure for all involved." [...] Because the alcohol was being given intravenously, the doctor could continue giving the treatment to the mother long after she had passed out, resulting in her being more intoxicated than would otherwise be possible. Such heavy intoxication is highly likely to contribute to FASD.|$|E
