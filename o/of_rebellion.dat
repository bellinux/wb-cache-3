5|$|Bridging the {{gap between}} self-expressive {{piercing}} and spiritual piercing, modern primitives use piercing {{and other forms of}} body modification as a way of ritually reconnecting with themselves and society, which according to Musafar once used piercing as a culturally binding ritual. But {{at the same time that}} piercing can be culturally binding, it may also be a means <b>of</b> <b>rebellion,</b> particularly for adolescents in Western cultures.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{there are}} no records of a {{large-scale}} Greek slave revolt {{comparable to that of}} Spartacus in Rome. It can probably be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would have prevented any large-scale planning. Slave revolts were rare, even in Rome. Individual acts <b>of</b> <b>rebellion</b> of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.|$|E

5|$|During the 16th century, the {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta and the First Barons' War shifted. Henry VII took power {{at the end of}} the turbulent Wars of the Roses, followed by Henry VIII, and extensive propaganda under both rulers promoted the legitimacy of the regime, the illegitimacy of any sort <b>of</b> <b>rebellion</b> against royal power, and the priority of supporting the Crown in its arguments with the Papacy.|$|E

5|$|The king of Kucha, Haripushpa, {{was taken}} to the Tang capital as a prisoner. Execution was the {{punishment}} <b>of</b> <b>rebellion</b> in accordance with Tang law.

He was also named Great Army Commander for the Militant Guards of the Left, a title he received from the emperor.|$|E
5|$|A period <b>of</b> <b>rebellion</b> at {{the start}} of the 19th century led to the rise of the {{progressive}} Sultan Mahmud II and eventually to the Tanzimat period, which produced political reforms and allowed new technology to be introduced to the city. Bridges across the Golden Horn were constructed during this period, and Istanbul was connected to the rest of the European railway network in the 1880s. Modern facilities, such as a water supply network, electricity, telephones, and trams, were gradually introduced to Istanbul over the following decades, although later than to other European cities. The modernization efforts were not enough to forestall the decline of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Although born in Missoula, Montana, Lynch {{spend his}} youth {{traveling}} across the United States {{due to his}} father Donald's job for the Department of Agriculture; as a result, Lynch attended school across several states.

However, Lynch took to building fireworks and playing the bongos in a Beat Generation nightclub as acts <b>of</b> <b>rebellion,</b> before discovering that he could translate his childhood fascination with drawing and painting into a career in fine art. Lynch and his close friend Jack Fisk travelled to Austria hoping to study under Oskar Kokoschka, but the artist was not present at the time.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Dudley {{assembled}} {{a force of}} 500 men at Ware, Hertfordshire to assist in his brother's campaign against Mary Tudor. Presumably arrested with him in East Anglia, he was imprisoned in the Tower on 25 July. Accused with his family <b>of</b> <b>rebellion</b> and high treason, Dudley stood trial at Westminster Hall on 19 August 1553. He pleaded guilty and only asked that his jewels {{that were in the}} keeping of a wardrobe colleague should not be lost. On 21 August 1553, the day before John Dudley's execution, he appeared with him and other condemned persons at the Tower Chapel St. Peter ad Vincula to hear mass. His life was spared, and he was released in January 1555.|$|E
5|$|Cambridge Castle was one {{of three}} castles built across the east of England in late 1068 by William the Conqueror in the {{aftermath}} of his northern campaign to capture York. Cambridge, or Grantabridge as it was then known, was on the old Roman route from London to York and was both strategically significant and at risk <b>of</b> <b>rebellion.</b> The initial building work was conducted by Picot, the high sheriff, who later founded a priory beside the castle. The castle was built in a motte and bailey design, within the existing town, and 27 houses had to be destroyed to make space for it.|$|E

Their hairstyle, unusually long for the era and mocked by many adults, became an emblem <b>of</b> <b>rebellion</b> to the burgeoning youth culture.|$|E

5|$|In late 1774, Colonial leaders {{adopted the}} Suffolk Resolves in {{resistance}} to the alterations made to the Massachusetts colonial government by the British parliament following the Boston Tea Party. The colonial assembly responded by forming a Patriot provisional government known as the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and calling for local militias to train for possible hostilities. The Colonial government exercised effective control of the colony outside of British-controlled Boston. In response, the British government in February 1775 declared Massachusetts {{to be in a}} state <b>of</b> <b>rebellion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{roads in}} the Lowlands were {{maintained}} by justices from a monetary levy on landholders and work levy on tenants. The development of national grain prices indicates the network had improved considerably by the early eighteenth century. By {{the end of the}} seventeenth century, the drover's roads, stretching down from the Highlands through south-west Scotland to north-east England and used for the transport of Highland Cattle for the English meat market, had become firmly established. In the Highlands and Galloway in the early eighteenth century, a series of military roads were built and maintained by the central government, with the aim of facilitating the movement of troops in the event <b>of</b> <b>rebellion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Revolutionary sentiments were stoked in 1872 {{after three}} priests—Mariano Gómez, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora (collectively known as Gomburza)—were accused of sedition by colonial {{authorities}} and executed. This would inspire a propaganda movement in Spain, organized by Marcelo H. del Pilar, José Rizal, and Mariano Ponce, lobbying for political {{reforms in the}} Philippines. Rizal was eventually executed on December 30, 1896, on charges <b>of</b> <b>rebellion.</b> As attempts at reform met with resistance, Andrés Bonifacio in 1892 established the secret society called the Katipunan, who sought independence from Spain through armed revolt.|$|E

5|$|Strafford's {{fall from}} power {{weakened}} Charles's influence in Ireland. The {{dissolution of the}} Irish army was unsuccessfully demanded three times by the English Commons during Strafford's imprisonment, until Charles was eventually forced through lack of money to disband the army {{at the end of}} Strafford's trial. Disputes concerning the transfer of land ownership from native Catholic to settler Protestant, particularly in relation to the plantation of Ulster, coupled with resentment at moves to ensure the Irish Parliament was subordinate to the Parliament of England, sowed the seeds <b>of</b> <b>rebellion.</b> When armed conflict arose between the Gaelic Irish and New English, in late October 1641, the Old English sided with the Gaelic Irish while simultaneously professing their loyalty to the king.|$|E
5|$|The Han dynasty took umbrage at {{the diplomats}} killed {{with her and}} saw this event as an act <b>of</b> <b>rebellion.</b> Emperor Wu sent a {{military}} campaign consisting of 2,000 soldiers led by General Han Qianqiu to quell the revolt. The general died in battle and the Han forces lost. The second campaign, led by the generals Lu Bode and Yang Pu, was dispatched by sea with 100,000 soldiers {{in the fall of}} 112 BC. They reached the city of Panyu, located in modern Guangzhou, in 111–110 BC and defeated the rebels.|$|E
5|$|After James was deposed by William III and Mary II in the Glorious Revolution in late 1688, Massachusetts rose up in {{rebellion}} against Andros, arresting {{him and other}} dominion leaders in Boston. The revolt rapidly spread through the dominion, and the New England colonies quickly restored their pre-dominion governments. When news of the Boston revolt reached New York a week later, Nicholson took no steps to announce news of it, or of the revolution in England, for fear of raising prospects <b>of</b> <b>rebellion</b> in New York. When word of the Boston revolt reached Long Island, politicians and militia leaders became more assertive, and by mid-May dominion officials had been ousted {{from a number of}} communities. At the same time, Nicholson learned that France had declared war on England, bringing the threat of French and Indian attacks on New York's northern frontier. In an attempt to mollify panicked citizenry over rumored Indian raids, Nicholson invited the militia to join the army garrison at Fort James.|$|E
