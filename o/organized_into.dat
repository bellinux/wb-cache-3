5|$|Dry air {{and land}} {{weakened}} the tropical wave, {{and when it}} entered {{the area of the}} Bay of Campeche, it merged with a stationary frontal boundary. Cool, dry air around the system caused the system to develop a cold core, and the area <b>organized</b> <b>into</b> an extratropical low on September 30. A large high pressure system over the northern Gulf of Mexico forced the system southward, where it developed significant convection. The system developed a warm core, and on October 1 the storm <b>organized</b> <b>into</b> Tropical Storm Larry while located 300mi (483km) east-southeast of Tampico, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} <b>organized</b> <b>into</b> a tropical depression {{off the coast}} of Nicaragua on October 9.

It passed through the Florida Keys before entraining cooler, drier air from a stationary frontal boundary. Its convection became very disorganized, and Floyd weakened back to a tropical storm early on October 13 to the southeast of Miami; the storm crossed the Bahamas, and becoming an extratropical cyclone before being absorbed by the frontal boundary on October 14.|$|E

40|$|Single-cell {{heterogeneity}} confounds {{efforts to}} understand how a population of cells <b>organizes</b> <b>into</b> cellular networks that underlie tissue-level function. This complexity is prominent in the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Here, individual neurons exhibit a remarkable amount of asynchronous behavior and transcriptional heterogeneity. However, SCN neurons are able to generate precisely coordinated synaptic and molecular outputs that synchronize the body to a common circadian cycle by <b>organizing</b> <b>into</b> cellular networks. To understand this emergent cellular network property, {{it is important to}} reconcile single-neuron heterogeneity with network organization. In light of recent studies suggesting that transcriptionally heterogeneous cells <b>organize</b> <b>into</b> distinct cellular phenotypes, we characterized the transcriptional, spatial, and functional organization of 352 SCN neurons from mice experiencing phase-shifts in their circadian cycle. Using the community structure detection method and multivariate analytical techniques, we identified previously undescribed neuronal phenotypes that are likely to participate in regulatory networks with known SCN cell types. Based on the newly discovered neuronal phenotypes, we developed a data-driven neuronal network structure in which multiple cell types interact through known synaptic and paracrine signaling mechanisms. These results provide a basis from which to interpret the functional variability of SCN neurons and describe methodologies toward understanding how a population of heterogeneous single cells <b>organizes</b> <b>into</b> cellular networks that underlie tissue-level function...|$|R
