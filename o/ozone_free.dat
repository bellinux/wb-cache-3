Using a background current, measured at a defined timed after exposure to high ozone may often overestimate the real background, leading to artificially low ozone concentrations in the upper tropical troposphere, and may frequently lead to operator dependent uncertainties. Based on these laboratory measurements an improved cell current to partial pressure conversion is proposed, which removes operator dependent variability in the background reading and possible artifacts in this measurement. Data from the Central Equatorial Pacific Experiment (CEPEX) have been reprocessed using the improved background treatment based on these laboratory measurements. In the reprocessed data set near-zero ozone events no longer occur. At Samoa, Fiji, Tahiti, and San Cristóbal, nearly all near-zero ozone concentrations occur in soundings with larger background currents.

40|$|Photometric {{measurements}} were collected {{for a new}} study aimed at estimating orbital debris sizes based on object brightness. To obtain a size from optical measurements the current practice is to assume an albedo and use a normalized magnitude to calculate optical size. However, assuming a single albedo value may not be valid for all objects or orbit types and material type and orientation can mask an object’s true optical cross section. This experiment used a CCD camera to record data, a 300 W Xenon <b>Ozone</b> <b>Free</b> collimated light source to simulate solar illumination, and a robotic arm with five degrees of freedom to move the piece of simulated debris through various orientations. The pseudo-debris pieces used in this experiment originate from the European Space Operations Centre’s ESOC 2 ground test explosion of a mock satellite.

The treatment with various power series of ozone generating and <b>ozone</b> <b>free</b> lamps to normal grease filters and TiO 2 coated grease filters were examined and the obtained results are compared {{to each other in}} this paper. The effect of ozone reaction was observed and compared with the effect of TiO 2. The experiments were solely based on the photo oxidation and photo catalytic oxidation reactions. TiO 2 is a green catalyst used in the photocatalytic reaction. Sunflower oil was used for grease production and tetracholoroethylene as a solvent. Grease samples were collected from the ventilation duct connected to the cooking hood system. Sample extraction was done in ultrasonic bath with the principle of sonication. The sample analysis was done by FTIR machine. The result determining the concentration of grease was the quantification of saturated C-H bonds in the chosen peak group of the spectrum. A very low power of UVC light functions perfectly with the Titanium dioxide. The experimental results have shown the combined treatment of titanium dioxide and UV light is an effective method in grease removal process. The photocatalytic reaction with titanium dioxide is better than photo oxidation reaction with ozone treatment.

In {{order to assess}} the environmental impact caused by the surface-adsorbed PAHs, the chemical lifetimes of these compounds in the atmosphere must be determined. Although ozone {{is known to be}} a primary reactant in the chemical transformation of surface-adsorbed PAHs in the atmosphere, the kinetics of these reactions have not been investigated in detail. In addition to the experimental difficulties that arise in using an oxygen-ozone stream while monitoring the PAH with fluorescence, complications in analyzing the kinetic mechanism also exist. It is difficult to determine whether the ozone or oxygen initially quenches the excited state of PAH. Ozone could enhance the degradation rate by simply reacting with a product derived from the excited state of PAH and oxygen. The focus {{of this study is to}} demonstrate the use of fluorescence spectroscopy in monitoring the degradation of PAH adsorbed on a three dimensional particle in the presence of gaseous <b>ozone</b> <b>free</b> from the interference of oxygen.

The results are shown in Figs.  4 and 5. The color and COD removal efficiency depends directly on the concentration of oxidants produced by the electrodes which in turn depends upon time (X 3). When the value of X 3 increases, an increase occurs in the concentration of active chlorine. Consequently, {{an increase in the}} X 3 in turn increases the color and COD removal efficiency.

In {{the case of}} ozone, their {{operational}} use for short-term forecast and monitoring implies to identify and reduce their uncertainties. Classically, RCTM are evaluated against surface observations since their primary goal is to simulate surface ozone concentrations. Free tropospheric performances of such models are less evaluated. Nevertheless, {{in the case of}} <b>ozone,</b> <b>free</b> tropospheric concentrations are crucial {{from the point of view}} of 1) regional climate change, 2) air quality: it is important to evaluate long-range transport of pollutants from source regions and the downward exchange between free troposphere and the boundary layer, which is poorly documented at the moment. The GEMS European project gives the opportunity to evaluate an ensemble of 6 RCTM (and the IFS-MOZART model) to simulate vertical profiles of tropospheric ozone concentrations. To conduct such model evaluation, profiles provided by ozone sondes and made on board commercial aircrafts (MOZAIC program) are very precious, nevertheless their spatio-temporal coverage remains weak. The new generation of nadir viewing infrared sounder (TES, IASI) is now operational and it opens new perspectives to study free tropospheric ozone. Their higher sensitivity to the free tropospheric ozone concentrations or maybe, in some cases to the boundary layer concentrations can be a good constraint for models. Among the objectives of this work, we want first evaluate skills of RCTM to model free tropospheric concen- trations at various temporal scale, more specifically, in the context of the GEMS project the impact of boundary conditions on the forecasted ozone values is evaluated as well as the ability of the IASI measurements to be used for model evaluation and future assimilation will be discussed...|$|E

Aging experiments were performed in a rotating drum chamber subjecting bioaerosols, Bacillus thuringiensis Al Hakam (BtAH) spores and MS 2 bacteriophages to ozone at 0 and 150 ppb, and relative humidities (RH) at 10 %, 50 %, and 80 +%. Fluorescence spectra and intensities of the aerosols {{as a function of}} time in the reaction chamber were measured with a single particle fluorescence spectrometer (SPFS) and an Ultra-Violet Aerodynamic Particle Sizer® Spectrometer (UV-APS). Losses in biological activity were measured by culture and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) assay. For both types of aerosols the largest change in fluorescence emission was between 280 and 400 nm when excited at 263 nm followed by fluorescence emission between 380 and 700 nm when excited at 351 nm. The fluorescence for both BtAH and MS 2 were observed to decrease significantly at high ozone concentration and high RH when excited at 263 nm excitation. The decreases in 263 nm excited fluorescence are indicative of hydrolysis and oxidation of tryptophan in the aerosols. Fluorescence measured with the UV-APS (355 -nm excitation) increased with time for both BtAH and MS 2 aerosols. A two log loss of MS 2 bacteriophage infectivity was observed in the presence of ozone at ~ 50 % and 80 % RH when measured by culture and normalized for physical losses by q-PCR. Viability of BtAH spores after exposure could not be measured due to the loss of genomic material during experiments, suggesting degradation of extracelluar DNA attributable to oxidation. The results of these studies indicate that the physical and biological properties of bioaerosols change significantly after exposure to ozone and water vapor...|$|E

The simulation for East Asia indicates that the contribution from tropospheric origin to the enhancement of TCO is comparable to that from stratospheric origin at latitudes close to the STJ, resulting in the high correlation of the E-TCO belt and the STJ.

For the selection of these events we identified a significant contribution of the stratospheric ozone reservoir to the high concentrations of ozone in the middle and lower free troposphere over the EMME. A distinct increase of ozone is found over the EMME in the middle troposphere during summer {{as a result of the}} fold activity, shifting towards the southeast and decreasing altitude. We find that the interannual variability of near-surface ozone over the eastern Mediterranean (EM) during summer is related to that of both tropopause folds and <b>ozone</b> in the <b>free</b> troposphere...|$|R
40|$|A {{multi-model}} {{study of}} the long-range transport of ozone and its precursors from major anthropogenic source regions was coordinated by the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (TF HTAP) under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP). Vertical profiles of ozone at 12 -h intervals from 2001 are available from twelve of the models contributing to this study and are compared here with observed profiles from ozonesondes. The contributions from each major source region are analysed for selected sondes, and this analysis is supplemented by retroplume calculations using the FLEXPART Lagrangian particle dispersion model to {{provide insight into the}} origin of ozone transport events and the cause of differences between the models and observations. In the boundary layer ozone levels are in general strongly affected by regional sources and sinks. With a considerably longer lifetime in the <b>free</b> troposphere, <b>ozone</b> here is to a much larger extent affected by processes on a larger scale such as intercontinental transport and exchange with the stratosphere. Such individual events are difficult to trace over several days or weeks of transport. This may explain why statistical relationships between models and ozonesonde measurements are far less satisfactory than shown in previous studies for surface measurements at all seasons. The lowest bias between model-calculated ozone profiles and the ozonesonde measurements is seen in the winter and autumn months. Following the increase in photochemical activity {{in the spring and summer}} months, the spread in model results increases, and the agreement between ozonesonde measurements and the individual models deteriorates further. At selected sites calculated contributions to ozone levels in the free troposphere from intercontinental transport are shown. Intercontinental transport is identified based on differences in model calculations with unperturbed emissions and emissions reduced by 20 % by region. Intercontinental transport of ozone is finally determined based on differences in model ensemble calculations. With emissions perturbed by 20 % per region, calculated intercontinental contributions to <b>ozone</b> in the <b>free</b> troposphere range from less than 1 ppb to 3 ppb, with small contributions in winter. The results are corroborated by the retroplume calculations. At several locations the seasonal contributions to <b>ozone</b> in the <b>free</b> troposphere from intercontinental transport differ from what was shown earlier at the surface using the same dataset. The large spread in model results points to a need of further evaluation of the chemical and physical processes in order to improve the credibility of global model results...|$|R
40|$|With the {{infrared}} observations {{made by the}} Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on board the EOS-Aqua satellite, which include the 9. 73 micron channel, a method is developed to deduce horizontal patterns of tropospheric <b>ozone</b> in cloud <b>free</b> conditions {{on a scale of}} about 100 km. It is assumed that on such small scale, at a given instant, horizontal changes in stratospheric ozone are small compared to that in the troposphere. From theoretical simulations it is found that uncertainties in the land surface emissivity and the vertical thermal stratification in the troposphere can lead to significant errors in the inferred tropospheric ozone. Because of this reason in order to derive horizontal patterns of tropospheric ozone in a given geographic area a tuning of this method is necessary {{with the help of a}} few dependent cases. After tuning, this method is applied to independent cases of MODIS data taken over Los Angeles basin in cloud free conditions to derive horizontal distribution of ozone in the troposphere. Preliminary results indicate that the derived patterns of ozone resemble crudely the patterns of surface ozone reported by EPA...|$|R
