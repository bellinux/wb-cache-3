40|$|OBJECTIVES: To assess {{impact of}} serial lumbar {{punctures}} on association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> and prognosis in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis; to explore time course and relationship of <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> with neurological findings, CSF fungal burden, immune response, and CD 4 cell count. DESIGN: Evaluation of 163 HIV-positive ART-naive patients enrolled in three trials of amphotericin B-based therapy for cryptococcal meningitis in Thailand and South Africa. METHODS: Study protocols required four lumbar punctures with measurements of <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> {{over the first}} 2 weeks of treatment and additional lumbar punctures if <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> raised. Fungal burden and clearance, CSF immune parameters, CD 4 cell count, neurological symptoms and signs, and outcome at 2 and 10 weeks were compared between groups categorized by <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> at cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis. RESULTS: Patients with higher baseline fungal burden had higher baseline <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> High fungal burden appeared necessary but not sufficient for development of high <b>pressure.</b> Baseline <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> {{was not associated with}} CD 4 cell count, CSF pro-inflammatory cytokines, or altered mental status. Day 14 <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> was associated with day 14 fungal burden. Overall mortality was 12 % (20 / 162) at 2 weeks and 26 % (42 / 160) at 10 weeks, with no significant differences between <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> groups. CONCLUSION: Studies are needed to define factors, in addition to fungal burden, associated with raised <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> Aggressive management of raised <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> through repeated CSF drainage appeared to prevent any adverse impact of raised <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> on outcome in patients with cryptococcal meningitis.

40|$|Introduction: Shunting {{systems are}} {{implanted}} for draining cerebrospinal fluid to treat hydrocephalus, intracranial cysts, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Most shunt systems include a valve which regulates drainage. A differential pressure valve opens when intracranial pressure exceeds the valve’s <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> The difficulty with these valves is selecting and predicting {{the most suitable}} valve <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> for the individual patient after insertion. Using a valve with a non-adjustable <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> requires surgery to change the <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> Potentially, an adjustable valve, such as the Codman Hakim programmable valve, allows non-invasive valve pressure-adjustment for managing over- and underdrainage {{by being able to}} fine-tune the valve's <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> to the patient’s changing intracranial hydrodynamics. Objective: To evaluate the use of an adjustable valve in a consecutive, non-selected group of patients. To evaluate its reliance, spectrum of complications, use and effects of <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> adjustments and economical impact. Results and conclusions: An adjustable valve has the advantage of enabling trans-cutaneous alterations of the valve's <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> as the patients’ clinical course changes during the postoperative period. Pressure-adjustment optimized treatment, and clinical outcome improved following the majority of adjustments. Subdural fluid collections could be managed with pressure-adjustment. The rate of shunt complications was similar to other studies. Valve malfunction was uncommon. Accidental pressure-resetting, other than that caused by magnetic resonance imaging, was rare. Avoided shunt revisions reduce cost. Because we cannot predict which patient will need pressure-adjustment, our preference is to use an adjustable valve for all conditions...|$|R

In 127 patients, 139 electromagnetic programmable shunt valves were implanted. Results. A nontraumatic subdural fluid collection was detected in 12 patients. The treatment of these patients consisted of reprogramming of the valve’s <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> In 5 patients small subdural hematomas were detected; 4 of these patients were treated by raising the <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> alone and one patient required surgical drainage and change of the pressure setting.

40|$|Abstract Background The new Certas™ shunt for the {{treatment}} of hydrocephalus has seven standard pressure settings that according to the manufacturer range from 36 to 238 mmH 2 O, and an additional “Virtual Off” setting with an <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> > 400 mmH 2 O. Information on actual pressure response and reliability of shunt performance is important in clinical application, especially the “Virtual Off” setting as a non-surgical replacement for shunt ligation. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the in-vitro hydrodynamic performance of the Certas™ shunt. Methods Six new Certas™ shunts with proximal and distal catheters were tested with an automated, computerized test system that raised the pressure from zero to a maximum pressure and back to zero at each valve setting. Opening pressure and flow resistance were determined. Results For settings 1 – 7 the measured <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> range was 26 to 247 mmH 2 O, and the mean change in <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> for a one-step adjustment was between 33 and 38 mmH 2 O. For setting 8 (“Virtual Off”) the measured mean <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> was 494 [*]±[*] 34 mmH 2 O (range 451 to 556 mmH 2 O). The mean outflow resistance was 7. 0 [*]mmHg/ml/min (outflow conductance 17. 9 μl/s/kPa). Conclusions The six shunts had similar characteristics and closely matched the manufacturer’s specifications for <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> at settings 1 – 7. The <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> for the “Virtual Off” setting was nearly 500 mmH 2 O, which is 100 mmH 2 O higher than the manufacturer’s specification of “> 400 ” and should be functionally off for most patients with communicating hydrocephalus.

The measured reflected <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pressure</b> is high when the measurement distance is short and eye pressure is low. The cornea of an artificial eye is significantly deformed at a low IOP, and the applied <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pressure</b> is more concentrated in front of the ring-type nozzle because of the deformed cornea.
