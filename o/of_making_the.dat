5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was generally positive, praising the band's musicianship. Critics compared the band's sound to Porcupine Tree.

Additionally, the migration of select kernel code into userspace has the benefit <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> system more robust; if a userspace driver crashes, it will not crash the kernel.|$|E

5|$|Ecgbert's {{problems}} with the monasteries in his diocese came from the secular practice of families setting up monasteries that were totally under their control as a way <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> family lands book-land and free from secular service.

5|$|Fairley's {{proposed}} use of atebrin as a prophylactic {{agent was}} accepted and Fairley switched the Australian Army over to using atebrin as a prophylaxis instead of quinine in March 1943.

The Australian Army had only seven weeks' stock was on hand in March 1943 and US forces in both the South West Pacific and South Pacific Area were drawing on Australian Army stocks as they had not yet received adequate stocks of their own. The drug is also a dye, and had the known side effect <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> skin and eyeballs of the user go yellow in colour after repeated use but this was an acceptable drawback in wartime. Prolonged use could cause lichen planus and psychosis in rare cases, but atebrin still {{turned out to be}} much safer than quinine.

5|$|Herodotus {{suggests}} that the Allied ships were heavier and, by implication, less maneuverable. Their weight would further {{reduce the likelihood of}} the Allied ships employing the diekplous. The source of this heaviness is uncertain; possibly the Allied ships were bulkier in construction. Another suggestion is that the heaviness was caused by the weight of fully armoured hoplite marines. The Allies may have had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them (at the cost <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> ships even heavier). Indeed, Herodotus refers to the Greeks capturing ships, rather than sinking them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{a series of}} letters between Eldon {{businessmen}} and Carl E. Smith, the newly-inherited owner of the house, revealed differing opinions on continued use of the house: Smith wanted to renovate the house and protect it from vandalism only; the Eldon leaders were more in favor <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> house a historic site. The house was abandoned {{for much of the}} 1970s—a bullet was fired in an upstairs bedroom; weather and vandalism took their toll as well. Only in the late 1980s did the owner of the property consider turning the house over to the state. Indeed, many southern Iowans were conflicted on the issue—the owner wanted to keep the house only because he believed the current renters would have nowhere else to go if they were forced to leave.|$|E
5|$|Matheos, Moore and Portnoy {{recorded}} the album at Carriage House Studios in Stamford, Connecticut from June 2 to June 9, 2002. Songs {{with a strong}} progressive metal influence were mostly written by Matheos, while Moore had greater influence over the vocal-driven tracks. Portnoy made minor arrangement suggestions but did not {{take part in the}} actual writing of the album. The album's recording sessions were the first time Moore and Portnoy collaborated since 1994 in their work in Dream Theater. In 2009, Portnoy recalled that he found the experience <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> record difficult, and that he was frustrated by the lack of collaboration between him and Moore. Differences between Moore and Portnoy led to his return on the follow-up album as a session drummer rather than full-time member.|$|E
