Both trams were severely damaged; 705 was scrapped, the only Balloon to meet this fate until 2009 when 722 was scrapped due to collision damage. 706 was rebuilt as an open-topped Balloon.

According to Christian Wolmar, author of <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wrong</b> <b>Line,</b> the Railtrack board panicked in the wake of Hatfield. Because most of the engineering skill of British Rail had been sold off into the maintenance and renewal companies, Railtrack had no idea how many Hatfields were waiting to happen, nor did they have any way of assessing the consequence of the speed restrictions they were ordering – restrictions that brought the railway network to all but a standstill.|$|E

It refused to transmit one intelligible sentence. ‘It can speak, but it won't,’ explained one of Dolbear's lawyers." [...] It is now generally known that while a Reis machine, when clogged and out of order, would transmit a word or two in an imperfect way, it was built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>lines.</b> It was no more a telephone than a wagon is a sleigh, even though it is possible to chain the wheels and make them slide for a foot or two.

60|$|Thus much John Marrot {{observed}} {{when he saw}} a puff {{of white}} steam on the horizon far ahead of him. To reverse the engine and turn full steam on was the work of two seconds. Fire flew in showers from the wheels, and the engine trembled with the violent friction, nevertheless it still ran on for a considerable way, and the approaching train was within a comparatively short distance of him before he had got the Lightning to run backwards. It was not until he had got up speed to nigh forty miles an hour that he felt safe, looked back with a grim smile and breathed freely. Of course the driver of the passenger-train, seeing an engine <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>line</b> ahead, had also reversed at full speed and thus prevented a collision, which would inevitably have been very disastrous.|$|E

Well, I told her I had a most important engagement with a man at eleven, and she wanted to know what it was and I tried to think of something, but it sounded pretty feeble and she said I had better telephone to the man and put it off.
