[...] In the post-race press conference, Kenseth said of his result, [...] "We didn't qualify very good, but we were really happy with <b>our</b> <b>car.</b> When the race started, I didn't think we were quite {{as good as we}} were yesterday (in practice), but we were able to have really good pit stops." [...] Logano, who was involved in the biggest accident of the race, [...] "The biggest thing was, I was fine the whole time, [...] I'm not really sure what happened. The spotter was clearing me low. When I got down there, they checked up going into the corner and I got tagged from behind." ...|$|E
500|$|Afterward, Johnson began celebrating {{his fifth}} {{consecutive}} Sprint Cup Series championship. During the celebration, Johnson's crew chief, Chad Knaus commented, [...] "I think finally, finally after pulling this off Jimmie {{will get the}} respect that he deserves. Knowing {{what we had to}} do— come down here and beat them— and we beat them." [...] Hamlin, the points leader before the race, described his disappointment by saying, [...] "I’m disappointed. <b>Our</b> <b>car</b> was lightning fast until that last wreck. When we hit the 16 (Biffle) that knocked the toe-in out. It wasn’t as fast after that. It’s just circumstances but we had a great year. We won the most races (8) and we contended like we have never contended before but circumstances took us out of this one. I don’t think the 48 (Johnson) showed the strength this year like they did in the past and that opened the door for the rest of us." [...] Harvick, who finished third in points, stated: ...|$|E

We're {{just going to have to}} go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure <b>our</b> <b>car</b> is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E

Gordon was delighted with his victory: [...] "Incredible team effort. This whole year has been amazing. What a great car. I've never had a car like this at Texas. We finally had one {{and put it in}} position." [...] Johnson was happy with his second-place result, saying, [...] "It was nice to get <b>our</b> <b>car</b> up front and get some clean air on it. We had to work really hard all day long to keep the car right. I'm very proud of the team." [...] Third-place finisher Biffle was candid with his performance: [...] "We worked our way {{all the way back to}} fourth, third -- 15 more laps, would've passed [...] and then a little while longer we could've gotten [...] But, I just ran out of time, lost track position and weren't able to capitalize on it." ...|$|E

Edwards, Gordon, Ragan, Biffle, and Aric Almirola rounded out the first ten positions. Johnson, who was eleventh in the second session, could only manage 22nd. Following the third practice session, Harvick stated, [...] "We didn't put up a fast lap but it never slows down. I'm really excited." [...] Afterward, Johnson commented [...] "We struggled a little bit maybe in the first practice. But I found a good direction and started making some good gains there at the end. I feel really good about <b>our</b> <b>car.</b> It's very comfortable. I can run the top, run the bottom. I think we're in good shape."

I was trying to make something happen and got in the wall which ended up killing <b>our</b> <b>car.</b> The good part about that is I was able to save fuel because there was no pressure from behind. I was able to save fuel and our Camry got the best fuel mileage it got all day." [...] Kyle Busch's crew chief Dave Rogers said of his drivers' performance, [...] "I think he handled it well -- it's tough. You lead all these laps and he could have gone for the clean sweep this weekend -- win all three in a row. He deserved to win all three in a row and to get beat -- it's tough.", he continued, [...] "We're disappointed -- this Toyota deserved to be in Victory Lane. I thought we had one of the best cars throughout the entire race, but it just didn't work out that way. We were a little short on fuel." ...|$|E

You use your imagination, and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design. <b>Our</b> <b>car</b> characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don't have." [...] Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: [...] "It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the Cars models, than it did to interpret something like The Incredibles models. With The Incredibles, the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage. But with Cars, it departs completely from any reference. Yes they're cars, but no car can do what our characters do. It's pure fantasy. It took a lot of trial and error to get them to look right." ...|$|E
