Fort Pasir Panjang was built on Labrador and Fort Siloso on Pulau Blakang Mati (now Sentosa). It was found that the steep cliffs and thick mangrove swamps surrounding the two forts acted as an ideal natural barrier to intruders.|$|E

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Review,</b> Admiral Graf Spee returned to Spain {{for a fourth}} non-intervention patrol. Following fleet manoeuvres and a brief visit to Sweden, the ship conducted a fifth and final patrol in February 1938. In 1938, KzS Hans Langsdorff took command of the vessel; she {{conducted a series of}} goodwill visits to various foreign ports throughout the year. These included cruises into the Atlantic, where she stopped in Tangier and Vigo. She also participated in extensive fleet manoeuvres in German waters. She was part of the celebrations for the reintegration of the port of Memel into Germany, and a fleet review in honour of Admiral Miklós Horthy, the Regent of Hungary. Between 18 April and 17 May 1939, she conducted another cruise into the Atlantic, stopping in the ports of Ceuta and Lisbon. On 21 August 1939, Admiral Graf Spee departed Wilhelmshaven, bound for the South Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>review,</b> Rhode Island steamed to New York for an overhaul at the New York Navy Yard. During the overhaul, on 8 March, {{the ship was}} assigned to the 3rd Division, 1st Squadron. After emerging from the dry dock, she resumed her normal peacetime routine of maneuvers {{with the rest of the}} squadron, gunnery practice, and training cruises. In February 1910 she was sent on a cruise in the Caribbean. The ship was reassigned to the 4th Division, 1st Squadron on 20 October, and two weeks later she and the rest of the squadron held a naval review in Boston for President William Howard Taft on 2 November. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to visit European ports; Rhode Island went to Gravesend. During the cruise, the fleet conducted large scale battle and reconnaissance training. Rhode Island and the rest of the ships recrossed the Atlantic and stopped in Guantanamo Bay on 13 January 1911.|$|E
5|$|Hyperbaric {{oxygen therapy}} (HBO) has been {{evaluated}} as an add on treatment following TBI. The {{findings of a}} 2012 Cochrane systematic review does not justify the routine use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat people recovering from a traumatic brain injury. This review also reported {{that only a small}} number of randomized controlled trials had been conducted at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>review,</b> many of which had methodological problems and poor reporting. HBO for TBI is controversial with further evidence required to determine if it has a role.|$|E

50|$|In his talk, Nordhaus criticised {{the fact}} that <b>the</b> Stern <b>Review</b> had not been subject to a peer-review, and {{repeated}} earlier criticisms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Review's</b> discount rate. William Cline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peterson Institute supported <b>the</b> <b>Review's</b> general conclusions, but was uncomfortable about how most (greater than 90%) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Review's</b> monetised damages <b>of</b> climate change occur after 2200. Cline noted that <b>the</b> <b>Review's</b> large cost-benefit ratio for mitigation policy allows room for these long-term costs to be reduced substantially but still support aggressive action to reduce emissions.|$|R
5|$|In {{science as}} in everything, {{small-scale}} synthesizers usually get credit from all constituent parties, but truly great synthesizers can fall between {{the cracks in}} the cycle of scientific credit. Ledyard Stebbins was in the latter category; neither fish nor fowl, he frequently failed to receive credit for work in some areas, usually at the hands of narrower colleagues. Few, however, have challenged his contributions to plant evolutionary biology, nor questioned his ability to synthesize disparate literature into a coherent framework. His ability to read quickly, recognize novel insights, digest new material, and then integrate the knowledge were the hallmarks of his scientific work style. He was a masterful synthesizer and master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>review</b> essay or synthetic thought piece.|$|E

The NWA World Tag Team Championship match and Jushin Liger versus Samoa Joe were both given a 7 out of 10. The Diamonds in the Rough versus Apolo, Shark Boy, and Sonny Siaki was given the lowest rating of Kapur's review, a 5 out of 10.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{questioning}} of Oppenheimer concerned {{his role in}} the hiring for Los Alamos of his former students Ross Lomanitz and Joseph Weinberg, both members of the Communist Party. The questions probed into Oppenheimer's private life, including his affair with Jean Tatlock, a Communist with whom he stayed the night while he was married. Lansdale had concluded at the time that his interest in Tatlock was romantic rather than political. Nonetheless, this innocuous affair may have played more heavily in the minds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>review</b> panel.|$|E

5|$|The {{announcement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>review</b> {{appeared to}} have been triggered by a News International campaign, by way of one of its British tabloids, The Sun. On 11 May 2011, as it was serializing Kate McCann's book, Madeleine, The Suns front page hosted an open letter from the McCanns in which they asked Prime Minister David Cameron to set up a new inquiry; 20,000 people signed the newspaper's petition that day. On the same day, according to her testimony to the Leveson Inquiry, Theresa May spoke by telephone, at her instigation, to Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of News International, and Dominic Mohan, editor of The Sun. The next day she wrote to the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Paul Stephenson, to say that the Portuguese police had agreed to cooperate with a British inquiry. Within 24 hours, Cameron made the announcement about Operation Grange, to be financed by a Home Office contingency fund.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Steam {{began to}} accept player reviews of games. Other users can {{subsequently}} rate these reviews as helpful, humorous, or otherwise unhelpful, {{which are then}} used to highlight the most useful reviews on the game's Steam store page. Steam also aggregates these reviews and enable users to sort products based on this feedback while browsing the store. In May 2016, Steam further broke out these aggregations between all reviews overall and those made more recently in the last 30 days, a change Valve acknowledges to how game updates, particularly those in Early Access, can alter {{the impression of a}} game to users. To prevent observed abuse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>review</b> system by developers or other third-party agents, Valve modified the review system in September 2016 to discount review scores for a game from users that activated the product through a product key rather than directly purchased by the Steam score, though their reviews remain visible. Alongside this, Valve announced that it would end business relations with any developer or publisher that they have found to be abusing the review system.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1911, Vermont cruised south the Gulf of Mexico, {{stopping}} {{first in}} Pensacola, Florida. She then continued to Galveston, Texas, stopping there from 7 to 12 June, {{before returning to}} Pensacola the following day. The ship returned to the Atlantic and steamed north to Bar Harbor, Maine; she was present there for the 4th of July celebrations, after which the typical routine of training with the Atlantic Fleet off Provincetown and in Cape Cod Bay followed. She remained off New England through mid-August. During this period, she visited Salem, Massachusetts and underwent repairs at the Boston Navy Yard. Later in the year, she moved south to Tangier Sound and the Virginia Capes for gunnery experiments and target practice. From 12 September to 9 October, Vermont was in the Norfolk Navy Yard for repairs, after which she steamed to Hampton Roads before proceeding with the fleet to New York City for a Naval Review that lasted from 24 October to 2 November. After the conclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>review,</b> she joined the 1st Squadron for maneuvers {{and then returned to}} Hampton Roads.|$|E
