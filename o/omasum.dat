5|$|The stomach of Artiodactyls {{is divided}} into four sections: the rumen, the reticulum, the <b>omasum</b> and the abomasum (only {{ruminants}} have a rumen). After the plant material is consumed, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material. The solids lump {{together to form a}} bolus (or cud), and is regurgitated. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and swallowed again. Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa and fungi) produce cellulase, which is needed to break down the cellulose in plants. Perissodactyls, in contrast to the ruminants, store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where it is fermented by bacteria. Carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibers. The caecum is either absent or short and simple, and the large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine.|$|E

An exception to this is the Boer goat, which sometimes may have up to eight teats.|$|E
50|$|Methanogens are a {{group of}} {{microorganisms}} that can produce methane as a byproduct of their metabolism.They hold an important place in the digestive system of ruminants. The digestive tract of ruminants contain four major parts, they are abomasum, rumen, <b>omasum</b> and reticulum.The food with saliva is first passed to the rumen for breaking them into smaller particles and then it moves to the reticulum where the food is broken into further smaller particles and the indigestable particles are sent back for rechewing and then to rumen. The majority of the anaerobic microbes assisting the cellulose breakdown occupy the rumen. They initiate the fermentation process.The animal observes the fatty acids,vitamins and nutrient content on passing the partially digested food from rumen to <b>omasum</b> which,decreases the pH level and thus initiates the release of enzymes for further break down the food which is later passed to the abomasumthat absorbs remaining nutrients before excretion.This process takes about 9-12 hours.|$|E
50|$|Though the rumen and {{reticulum}} {{have different}} names, {{they represent the}} same functional space as digesta can {{move back and forth}} between them. Together, these chambers are called the reticulorumen. The degraded digesta, which is now in the lower liquid part of the reticulorumen, then passes into the next chamber, the <b>omasum,</b> where water and many of the inorganic mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream.|$|E
5000|$|When {{food has}} been {{degraded}} efficiently it passes from the reticulorumen through the reticulo-omasal orifice to the <b>omasum</b> {{followed by the}} abomasum to continue the digestion process in the lower parts of the alimentary canal. No enzymes are secreted in the rumen. Enzymes and hydrochloric acid are only secreted from the Abomasum (fourth stomach) onwards, and ruminants function from that point onwards much like monogastric animals, such as pigs and humans ...|$|E

5000|$|The [...] <b>omasum,</b> {{also known}} as the bible, the fardel, the {{manyplies}} and the psalterium, is the third compartment of the stomach in ruminants. Though its functions have not been well-studied, it appears to primarily aid in the absorption of water, magnesium, and the volatile fatty acids produced by rumen fermentation, that have not been absorbed into the bloodstream yet. The numerous folds of its mucosa are thought to trap digesta particles so the maximum amount of nutrients may be absorbed.|$|E
50|$|The meats {{that are}} most {{commonly}} used are chicken and beef, {{but there are also}} variations with offal, mutton, and water buffalo meat. Pork is seldom used in traditional Indonesian soto, however in Hindu majority Bali, soto babi (pork soto) can be found. The soup is usually accompanied by rice or compressed rice cakes (lontong, ketupat or burasa). Offal is considered as a delicacy: the rumen (blanket/flat/smooth tripe), reticulum (honeycomb and pocket tripe), <b>omasum</b> (book/bible/leaf tripe) and the intestines are all eaten.|$|E
50|$|During grazing, {{ruminants}} produce {{large amounts}} of saliva - estimates range from 100 to 150 litres of saliva per day for a cow. The role of saliva is to provide ample fluid for rumen fermentation and {{to act as a}} buffering agent. Rumen fermentation produces {{large amounts of}} organic acids, thus maintaining the appropriate pH of rumen fluids is a critical factor in rumen fermentation. After digesta pass through the rumen, the <b>omasum</b> absorbs excess fluid so that digestive enzymes and acid in the abomasum are not diluted.|$|E
50|$|In the ventral reticulum, less dense, larger digesta {{particles}} may be propelled up {{into the}} oesophagus and mouth during contractions of the reticulum. Digesta is chewed in the mouth in {{a process known as}} rumination, then expelled back down the oesophagus and deposited in the dorsal sac of the reticulum, to be lodged and mixed into the ruminal mat again. Denser, small particles stay in the ventral reticulum during reticular contraction, and then during the next contraction may be swept out of the reticulorumen with liquid through the reticulo-omasal orifice, which leads to the next chamber in the ruminant animal's alimentary canal, the <b>omasum.</b>|$|E
50|$|Microbial {{fermentation}} degrades otherwise indigestible polymers in the reticulorumen to volatile {{fatty acids}} (VFAs), methane, and carbon dioxide. This fermentation is anaerobic, and allows the microbes in the reticulorumen to derive the energy and amino nitrogen for growth and reproduction. Ruminants absorb the VFAs across the reticulorumen wall as an energy source, while the microbes eventually flow out of the rumen into {{the remainder of the}} alimentary canal, where their constituent proteins are eventually digested and absorbed. The reticulum, at approximately 5-20 litres, is considerably smaller in capacity than the rumen, which is approximately 100-200 litres in cattle. The oesophageal groove, which links the oesophagus and the <b>omasum,</b> is located in the reticulum.|$|E
50|$|Abdominal organs can {{be highly}} {{specialized}} in some animals. For example, the stomach of ruminants (a suborder of mammals) is divided into four chambers - rumen, reticulum, <b>omasum</b> and abomasum.In vertebrates, the abdomen is a large cavity enclosed by the abdominal muscles, ventrally and laterally, and by the vertebral column dorsally. Lower ribs can also enclose ventral and lateral walls. The abdominal cavity is {{upper part of the}} pelvic cavity. It is attached to the thoracic cavity by the diaphragm. Structures such as the aorta, inferior vena cava and esophagus pass through the diaphragm. Both the abdominal and pelvic cavities are lined by a serous membrane known as the parietal peritoneum. This membrane is continuous with the visceral peritoneum lining the organs. The abdomen in vertebrates contains a number of organs belonging, for instance, to the digestive tract and urinary system.|$|E
50|$|In bovids, {{the third}} and fourth metapodials are {{combined}} into the cannon bone. The ulna and fibula are reduced, and fused with the radius and tibia, respectively. Long scapulae are present, whereas the clavicles are absent. Being ruminants, the stomach is composed of four chambers: the rumen (80%), the <b>omasum,</b> the reticulum, and the abomasum. The ciliates and bacteria of the rumen ferment the complex cellulose into simpler fatty acids, which are then absorbed through the rumen wall. Bovids have a long small intestine; the length of the small intestine in cattle is 29 - 49 m. Body temperature fluctuates through the day; for instance, in goats the temperature can change slightly from nearly 37 C in the early morning to 40 C in the afternoon. Temperature is regulated through sweating in cattle, whereas goats use panting for the same. The right lung, consisting of four to five lobes, is around 1.5 times larger than the left, which has three lobes.|$|E
50|$|Microbes in the reticulorumen {{eventually}} {{flow out}} into the <b>omasum</b> and {{the remainder of the}} alimentary canal. Under normal fermentation conditions the environment in the reticulorumen is weakly acidic and is populated by microbes that are adapted to a pH between roughly 5.5 and 6.5; since the abomasum is strongly acidic (pH 2 to 4), it acts as a barrier that largely kills reticulorumen flora and fauna as they flow into it. Subsequently, microbial biomass is digested in the small intestine and smaller molecules (mainly amino acids) are absorbed and transported in the portal vein to the liver. The digestion of these microbes in the small intestine is a major source of nutrition, as microbes usually supply some 60 to 90% of the total amount of amino acids absorbed. On starch-poor diets, they also provide the predominant source of glucose absorbed from the small intestinal contents. Under conditions of ruminal acidosis, when the environment of the reticulorumen has become too acidic (usually due to excessive fermentation of starches and sugars into VFA and lactate), microbes that favor a lower pH may start to dominate the ecosystem of the reticulorumen. This gives rise to rumen acidosis and often feed intake of the ruminant will drop.|$|E
50|$|All of the exponents of {{our laws}} whom I have known agree {{to this one}} opinion, {{that there are three}} fatty tissues (suet) which, eating, men would become liable to extirpation, and they are that which men offer to God the altar. They are the suet which lies upon the innards, and the suet (fat) which is upon the kidneys, and the suet which is upon the flanks. The suet which is upon the innards is that which is spread as a blanket over the inner {{ruminant}} stomach (Heb. Kores), which includes that which is upon the <b>omasum</b> (Heb. Messos) and the reticulum (Heb. Beith Hakossoth). That which is upon the kidneys is as it is implied, whose place is known; while that which is upon the flanks is that which is below the kidneys towards the hind side of the animal, attached to the fat of the kidneys, and which is in Aramaic Tarba de-Aqlivusta, where the joint of the hind legs (Aramaic: Deleifan Atmatha) is located, and which is the suet {{at the root of the}} thighs from within. Thus is it written by Maimonides, and by Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi, as also the author of Halachot Gedolot. Included in this category is the suet which clings to its side, spreading itself upon the flanks at both sides of the animal.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ruminants}} (Ruminantia and Tylopoda) ruminate {{their food}} - they regurgitate and re-chew it. Ruminants' mouths often have additional salivary glands, and the oral mucosa is often heavily calloused to avoid injury from hard plant parts {{and to allow}} easier transport of roughly chewed food. Their stomachs are divided into three to four sections: the rumen, the reticulum, the <b>omasum,</b> and the abomasum. After the food is ingested, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into layers of solid versus liquid material. The solids lump {{together to form a}} bolus (also known as the cud); this is regurgitated by reticular contractions while the glottis is closed. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and re-swallowed. The bolus is chewed slowly to completely mix it with saliva and to break it down. Ingested food passes to the [...] "fermentation chamber" [...] (rumen and reticulum), where it is kept in continual motion by rhythmic contractions. Cellulytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa, and fungi) produce cellulase, which is needed to break down the cellulose found in plant material. This form of digestion has two advantages: plants that are indigestible to other species can be digested and used, and the duration of the actual food consumption shortened; the animal spends only a short time out in the open with his head to the ground - rumination can take place later, in a sheltered area.|$|E
