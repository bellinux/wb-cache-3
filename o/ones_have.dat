30|$|At BL, all {{subjects}} were evaluated by a self-reported questionnaire for knee pathology and prior knee injuries that required surgical intervention. <b>One</b> female adolescent <b>had</b> an ACL tear that had been surgically repaired. Two adolescent males and two adolescent females had patellar pain syndrome. Eight adults had prior knee surgery.

Among the adult females, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> a nerve transection and knee cartilage debridement, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> knee arthroscopy, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> meniscus surgery, and <b>one</b> <b>had</b> a medial meniscectomy. One male adult reported pain below the patella, and two adult females had knee pain. No subjects experienced injuries between BL and 2 -year FU. Biomarker levels and patient-rated outcomes were compared between adults with and without prior knee injury to determine how this variable influenced results.|$|R

5|$|It {{is likely}} that these {{appointments}} were considered possible because the Irish Free State continued to recognise the British monarch as its official head of state. In 1937, however, the Irish Free State adopted a new constitution, rendering the Crown's position in Irish affairs ambiguous. The ambiguity was resolved 12 years later when the Irish Free State formally declared itself a republic and left the British Commonwealth. The basis for such appointments thus ceased and no further <b>ones</b> <b>have</b> been made.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{new types}} of burials and more {{imposing}} <b>ones</b> <b>have</b> been unearthed, which display {{a great variety of}} luxurious objects. Among the various burial types, the shaft grave became {{the most common form of}} elite burial, a feature that gave the name to the early period of Mycenaean Greece. Among the Mycenaean elite, deceased men were usually laid to rest in gold masks and funerary armor, and women in gold crowns and clothes gleaming with gold ornaments. The royal shaft graves next to the acropolis of Mycenae, in particular the Grave Circles A and B signified the elevation of a native Greek-speaking royal dynasty whose economic power depended on long-distance sea trade.|$|E

5|$|Since 1900, {{more than}} 15 large dams and many smaller <b>ones</b> <b>have</b> {{been built in}} the Willamette's {{drainage}} basin, and 13 of them are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The dams are used primarily to produce hydroelectricity, to maintain reservoirs for recreation, and to prevent flooding. The river and its tributaries support 60 fish species, including many species of salmon and trout; this is despite the dams, other alterations, and pollution (especially on the river's lower reaches). Part of the Willamette Floodplain was established as a National Natural Landmark in 1987 and the river was named as one of 14 American Heritage Rivers in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{music is}} a {{significant}} aspect of the nation's culture, with both traditional and modern influences. A famous traditional Scottish instrument is the Great Highland Bagpipe, a wind instrument consisting of three drones and a melody pipe (called the chanter), which are fed continuously by a reservoir of air in a bag. Bagpipe bands, featuring bagpipes and various types of drums, and showcasing Scottish music styles while creating new <b>ones,</b> <b>have</b> spread throughout the world. The clàrsach (harp), fiddle and accordion are also traditional Scottish instruments, the latter two heavily featured in Scottish country dance bands. There are many successful Scottish bands and individual artists in varying styles including Annie Lennox, Amy Macdonald, Runrig, Boards of Canada, Cocteau Twins, Deacon Blue, Franz Ferdinand, Susan Boyle, Emeli Sandé, Texas, The View, The Fratellis, Twin Atlantic and Biffy Clyro. Other Scottish musicians include Shirley Manson, Paolo Nutini and Calvin Harris.|$|E
5|$|All the composer's {{major works}} {{and many of}} the minor <b>ones</b> <b>have</b> been recorded. There have been {{numerous}} complete LP and CD sets of the nine symphonies, beginning with Boult's Decca cycle of the 1950s, most of which was recorded in the composer's presence. Although rarely staged, the operas have fared well on disc. The earliest recording of a Vaughan Williams opera was Hugh the Drover, in an abridged version conducted by Sargent in 1924. Since the 1960s there have been stereophonic recordings of Hugh the Drover, Sir John in Love, Riders to the Sea, The Poisoned Kiss, and The Pilgrim's Progress. Most of the orchestral recordings have been by British orchestras and conductors, but notable non-British conductors who have made recordings of Vaughan Williams's works include Herbert von Karajan, Leonard Bernstein, Leopold Stokowski, and, most frequently, André Previn, who conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in the first complete stereo cycle of the symphonies, recorded between 1967 and 1972. Among the British conductors most closely associated with Vaughan Williams's music on disc and in concert in the generations after Boult, Sargent and Barbirolli are Vernon Handley, Richard Hickox, Sir Mark Elder and Sir Andrew Davis. Record companies with extensive lists of Vaughan Williams recordings include EMI, Decca, Chandos, Hyperion and Naxos.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{describe}} {{the range of}} neuromuscular disorders which {{may be associated with}} cryptic coeliac disease.  METHODS—Nine patients were described with neuromuscular disorders associated with circulating antigliadin antibodies, whose duodenal biopsies later confirmed the diagnosis of coeliac disease. Neurological symptoms antedated the diagnosis of coeliac disease in all, and most had minimal or no gastrointestinal symptoms {{at the onset of the}} neuromuscular disorder.  RESULTS—Three patients had sensorimotor axonal peripheral neuropathy, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> axonal motor peripheral neuropathy, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> probable inclusion body myositis and axonal motor peripheral neuropathy, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> polymyositis and sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> mononeuropathy multiplex, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> neuromyotonia, and <b>one</b> <b>had</b> polyneuropathy.  CONCLUSION—A wide range of neuromuscular disease may be the presenting feature of coeliac disease. This represents the first report of inclusion body myositis and neuromyotonia associated with coeliac disease. Estimation of circulating antigliadin antibodies should be considered in all patients with neuromuscular disease of otherwise obscure aetiology. ...|$|R
