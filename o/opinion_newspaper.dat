40|$|Abstract. There is a {{considerable}} body of work suggesting that economic news has significant political and economic implications. Most work in political science assumes that responses to this news are symmetrical, however; indeed, this work also assumes that responses to the economy itself are symmetrical. This is most likely not true. There is, rather, {{reason to believe that}} negative economic information has a much greater impact on both news and opinion than positive economic information. This hypothesis is tested here, using time series analyses of British public <b>opinion,</b> <b>newspaper</b> content, and economic indicators. Strong evidence is found of asymmetric responsiveness. These results are analysed and discussed as they pertain to research on agenda-setting, priming, voting behaviour, economic policy, and the economy itself.

In 1893 MK Gandhi {{left for}} South Africa {{to act in}} a lawsuit between two Indian trading concerns. He {{established}} a legal practice in Durban and in 1894 founded the Natal Indian Congress. Gandhi was also responsible for the publication of the Indian <b>Opinion</b> <b>newspaper</b> from 1904 - 1914, and for {{most of the time he}} was the newspaper’s editor. He founded the Transvaal British Indian Association through which various protests and grievances were directed at the government on behalf of the Indians. In 1906, Gandhi began to develop the idea of satyagraha (“keeping the truth”). This was the exercise of non-violent non-compliance with an offending law, enduring suffering or imprisonment if necessary but without ceasing to show respect to those who made the law or enforced it. Gandhi’s resistance campaign reached a climax with protests against the Immigration Law of 1913 which prohibited further immigration by Indians to South Africa. Convinced of the power and nobility of satyagraha, Gandhi left South Africa in June 1914 to immerse himself in the Indian freedom struggle. The CM Doke Collection of personal letters from MK Gandhi has been entrusted to the Library of the University of South Africa (Unisa) by Dr Eunice Marion van den Aardweg who is the daughter of Professor Clement Martyn Doke and the granddaughter of the well-known Baptist minister and biographer of MK Gandhi, the Reverend Joseph John Doke. The friendship between the Doke and Gandhi families began in February 1908 when Doke offered to care for Gandhi at the Baptist manse after he had been severely assaulted The correspondence and printed materials in the Scrapbook reflect the friendship between the Gandhi and Doke families which spanned generations and decades. The materials in the Collection are described individually in the inventory...|$|E

The analysis employed is informed by systemic functional linguistics and utilizes the framework of transitivity analysis, which identifies ideational meanings realized by grammatical choices. Newspaper reports are commonly believed to represent facts in a neutral way. However, previous studies have pointed out that events are always interpreted by the writers before being represented in texts. Because of their ability to influence public <b>opinion,</b> <b>newspaper</b> reports have been the focus of several studies. Previous studies on newspaper reports using systemic functional linguistics have considered the relationships between linguistic choices and the representation of events. Though many studies on ideational meanings in newspaper reports have considered different perspectives realized by linguistic choices, few studies have investigated newspaper reports from multiple countries written in more than one language. Thus, this thesis investigates newspaper reports published in Australia, the United States, and Japan, which include articles written in English and Japanese. These cross-linguistic sets of newspaper reports were written about a specific issue where we can assume that these three countries would maintain different stances. The aim {{of this study is to}} locate different perspectives expressed by grammatical choices in the newspaper reports and to identify the strategies that the writers employed in expressing their stances in the newspapers. Based on the framework of transitivity analysis, process types and participants were identified in all the main clauses and subordinate clauses in the newspaper reports. Participants were further categorized with according to their affiliations, institutions, and their human or non-human nature. In addition, material and verbal processes were further analyzed according to their verb types, and the participants who were involved in each type of processes were identified. The findings of this analysis revealed linguistic strategies that may not be obvious to the readers, yet influence the news reports to reflect the writers' perspectives on the events. Australian reports utilized Japanese actors in negative material processes and showed positive inclinations to their anti-whaling stance. The US news reports featured the anti-whaling groups as actors and goals, and these choices also seemed to imply their anti-whaling stance. In contrast, the Japanese reports featured the Japanese government as actors and the Japanese officials as sayers and favored their pro-whaling stance. These findings show that the grammatical choices in newspaper reports played a role to covertly express the writers' perspectives toward the events and suggest that the readers could be affected by those linguistic manipulations in their opinion making process if they continue receiving input from one specific source...|$|E
