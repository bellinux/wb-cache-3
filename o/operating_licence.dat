In 2007, they {{signed a contract}} with Ofotbanen, {{and at the same time}} bought 40% of the company. However, Ofotbanen was in financial difficulties, causing a dispute between the two owners. The result was that Autolink formally established Cargolink in March 2008, without the knowledge of Ofotbanen, and terminated the contract with Ofotbanen in July. Cargolink received an <b>operating</b> <b>licence</b> in September and service started in November.|$|E

5|$|By 2004, Braathens {{had managed}} to cut costs {{sufficiently}} to make a profit. At the same time, SAS was having problems making a profit. SAS announced on 10 March 2004 that SAS and Braathens would be merged into a single company, SAS Braathens, in May. At the same time, the airline would create separate national airlines for Sweden and Denmark. SAS Braathens would operate 50 aircraft, all variations of the 737. The company took over the <b>operating</b> <b>licence</b> of Braathens, including the IATA and ICAO code, and callsign. Because all the operations streamlined and coordinated, {{there would be no}} further downstaffing due to the merger. From 1 June 2007, SAS Braathens was rebranded to Scandinavian Airlines, making it identical to the branding in Sweden and Denmark, although it remain a separate limited company named SAS Norge AS.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, British Airways {{took over}} British Midland International (BMI) which {{gave them a}} {{monopoly}} on UK mainland flights from Heathrow. In order for the deal to be completed, the European Union Competition Commissioner decreed that BA {{would have to give}} up 14 of BMI's landing slots at Heathrow to comply with EU competition regulations. 12 of these slots were set aside for domestic usage, which were bought by Virgin Atlantic after they outbid Aer Lingus for the required British domestic <b>operating</b> <b>licence.</b> Virgin announced that they would set up Virgin Atlantic Little Red as a subsidiary to use these slots to cover domestic UK mainland routes as Aer Lingus already provided competition for BA on flights to Northern Ireland from Heathrow. Little Red was later revealed to be operated on a wet-lease by Aer Lingus whereby the planes would be operated by Aer Lingus but would bear Virgin Atlantic livery. The pilots would be employed by Aer Lingus, with cabin crew supplied by McGinley Aviation. The cabin crew would wear Virgin Little Red uniforms and had training from Virgin, despite the fact that airline had not previously operated narrow-body aircraft.|$|E

500|$|The European Commission (EC) {{claimed that}} Alcan is in breach of their <b>operating</b> <b>licence</b> as the station {{has failed to}} [...] "significantly reduce its emissions". The UK Government contested the allegations, as the power station and smelter {{combined}} then provided 650 jobs and a contribution of £100,000,000 to the local economy, in an area heavily affected {{by the loss of}} traditional heavy industry. They lost the court case over it and on 22 April 2010, the European Court of Justice ruled that the plant was subject to the emission limit values of the European directive on Large Combustion Plants. As a consequence, the station has to have at least £200 million worth of adaptations made to it so that it conforms to the directive, or be shut down. A date has not yet been given for it to conform, but two options for saving the station are the CCS project, or a switch from coal to biomass as a fuel.|$|E

After a customer complaint, Vehicle and Operator Services Agency monitored services 4, 16, 27 and 45 in February 2010, and found that of 303 instances, 44 buses were running early, despite starting the route on time, while 20 were running late. The company's defence was that they had built in some running time to cope with the delays due to tram works, but in some places, these works had ended early. The Commissioner accepted this defence, and chose not to take action against the company's <b>operating</b> <b>licence</b> (which authorises a maximum of 700 vehicles).
