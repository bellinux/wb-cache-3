40|$|A new {{computer-controlled}} {{test system}} for mapping photoreceptor properties such as charge acceptance and discharge voltage will be described. The system allows rapid scanning of a photoreceptor to: 1) characterize its functional quality and uniformity, and 2) detect both charging and discharge defects of 50 - 100 µm in diameter or larger. The system can also perform conventional electrophotographic measurements to obtain dark decay, photo-induced discharge curves (PIDC), and fatigue properties. In addition to testing the complete photoreceptor product, a unique {{feature of the}} system is its ability to perform measurements on the sub-layers in a photoreceptor.

40|$|Information display {{technology}} is a rapidly growing research and development field. Using state-of-the-art technology, optical resolution can be increased dramatically by organic light-emitting diode - since the light emitting layer is very thin, under 100 nm. The main question is what pixel size is achievable technologically? The next generation of display will considers three-dimensional image display. In 2 D, one is considering vertical and horizontal resolutions. In 3 D or holographic images, there is another dimension – depth. The major requirement is the high resolution horizontal dimension in order to sustain the third dimension using special lenticular glass or barrier masks, separate views for each eye. The high-resolution 3 D display offers hundreds of more different views of objects or landscape. OLEDs have {{potential to be a}} key technology for information displays in the future. The {{display technology}} presented in this work promises to bring into use bright colour 3 D flat panel displays in a unique way. Unlike the conventional TFT matrix, OLED displays have constant brightness and colour, independent from the viewing angle i. e. the observer's position in front of the screen. A sandwich (just 0. 1 micron thick) of organic thin films between two conductors makes an OLE Display device. These special materials are named electroluminescent organic semi-conductors (or <b>organic</b> <b>photoconductors</b> (<b>OPC)).</b> When electrical current is applied, a bright light is emitted (electrophosphorescence) from the formed Organic Light-Emitting Diode. Usually for OLED an ITO layer is used as a transparent electrode. Such types of displays were the first for volume manufacture and only a few products are available in the market at present. The key challenges that OLED technology faces in the application areas are: producing high-quality white light achieving low manufacturing costs increasing efficiency and lifetime at high brightness. Looking towards the future, by combining OLED with specially constructed surface lenses and proper image management software {{it will be possible to}} achieve 3 D images...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of Monte-Carlo {{simulations}} of the charge carrier transport in a disordered molecular system containing spatial and energetic disorders using the dipolar glass model. Model parameters of the material were chosen to fit a typical polar <b>organic</b> <b>photoconductor</b> polycarbonate doped with 30 % of aromatic hydrazone, whose transport properties are well documented in literature. Simulated carrier mobility demonstrates a usual Poole-Frenkel field dependence and its slope {{is very close to}} the experimental value without using any adjustable parameter. At room temperature transients are universal with respect to the electric field and transport layer thickness. At the same time, carrier mobility does not depend on the layer thickness and transients develop a well-defined plateau where the current does not depend on time, thus demonstrating a non-dispersive transport regime. Tails of the transients decay as power law with the exponent close to - 2. This particular feature indicates that transients are close to the boundary between dispersive and non-dispersive transport regimes. Shapes of the simulated transients are in very good agreement with the experimental ones. In summary, we provide a first verification of a self-consistency of the dipolar glass transport model, where major transport parameters, extracted from the experimental transport data, are then used in the transport simulation, and the resulting mobility field dependence and transients are in very good agreement with the initial experimental data.

We have developed a near-room-temperature (< 95 °C) process flow to fabricate pentacene integrated organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) compatible with plastic substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Integration of inkjet printed <b>organic</b> <b>photoconductors</b> (OPDs) based on titanyl pthalocyanine with OTFTs is demonstrated {{for the first time}} in an integrated process. Using the OTFT as a switch in series with an OPD, a pixel circuit was designed and measured, in addition to a proof-of-concept 4 x 4 active matrix imager. The individual pixels were measured to have a responsivity of 6 x 10 - 5 A/W, and a pixel on/off conductance ratio of 880, both at an irradiance of 5 mW/cm 2. The imager uses a 25 V power supply and was shown to correctly image a "T" pattern after 1 st order calibration. A model for the current-voltage characteristics based upon amorphous silicon models was implemented in MATLAB to investigate design trade-offs in organic digital circuits. A dual threshold voltage process is suggested to enable area-efficient zero-VGS current sources. The area and power savings of this approach is discussed compared to a single VT process. We also motivate the necessity for lowering the power supply, both for area savings and improvement in circuit lifetime due to reduction in bias stress effects. A process flow for a dual VT OTFT technology, enabled using two gate metals, is presented. By using a low work function metal (aluminum) and a high work function metal (platinum), we can obtain two threshold voltage devices. (cont.) Devices were measured to be nominally identical, shifted by a VSG which we call the [Delta]VT. A [Delta]VT of 0. 6 V was consistently observed over multiple wafer lots. This is the first demonstration of modification of OTFT VT by changing the gate work function. Area-minimized digital logic designed in the dual VT technology was demonstrated with a 3 V supply, the lowest supply reported for integrated OTFTs. In addition, we report some of the first analog organic integrated circuits, including a differential pair with differential gain of 23 dB and common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of 23 dB. A two-stage uncompensated operational amplifier was fabricated and measured to have an open-loop gain of 36 dB and unity gain frequency of 7. 5 Hz. The op-amp has a unity gain-bandwidth product of 473 Hz while dissipating < 2 nW with a 5 V supply. The comparator uses 5 nW of power, and has an input offset of 200 mV. We show the frequency response of the op-amp and comparator are dominated by parasitic overlap capacitances. The parasitics of the zero-VGs load limits frequency response, and technological improvements to increase operating frequency are suggested. We motivate a self-aligned process flow, which uses a high optical density gate to serve as a mask layer. A backside exposure patterns the source/drain layer. It is demonstrated that the parasitic capacitances can be reduced by almost an order of magnitude, from 1 fF/jlm to 0. 15 fF/jm. A method to improve carrier mobility is also presented. These process improvements have the potential to improve the switching speeds of organic circuits by more than two orders of magnitude. by Ivan Alexander Nausieda. Thesis (Ph. D.)

As the first conference on supermaterials, SUPERMAT and its companion SMART 99 have begun to reveal new branches of research from the established pathways explored in superconductivity. At the conclusion of SUPERMAT in Giens, France, the participants were as energized by the exciting science that had been covered during the week as they were impressed by the French food, wine, scenery and hospitality.

40|$|When Bardeen, Shockley and Brattain {{produced}} the first prototype transistor in 1947 {{no one could}} have imagined the invention's impact on today's life. It was the advances in thin-film technology which {{paved the way for the}} transistor to wide range applicability. Organic semiconductors have been subject to research since the early 1960 s. In the mid 1980 s, the research on organic semiconductors took another leap forward when Karl, Warta and Stehle published their research on ultrapure, high mobility <b>organic</b> <b>photoconductors</b> and on charge carrier transport in organic conductors. Organic electronics have entered everyday life as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) can nowadays be found in a variety of applications. While OLEDs have accomplished the step from basic research to market readiness with sales exceeding $ 1 B/yr in 2008, organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) still lag behind. Nevertheless they are intensively studied as the material of choice in active matrix devices for flexible displays. One of the reasons for the absence of commercial OTFT applications is their slow switching speed due to low charge carrier mobility. The application of so-called dielectric surface modification (DSM) is one pathway towards high performance thin-film OTFTs. DSMs, which are based on organic molecules forming self-assembling monolayers or polymeric dielectrics, are studied due to their huge impact on OTFT device performance and on the film perfection of organic semiconductor thin-films. The appropriate choice of DSMs enables the combination of an arbitrary organic semiconductor with any substrate materials. Hence, the key factor to high performance and film perfection is the educated choice of thin and easily applicable DSM. However, the reason for the performance enhancement is not yet understood. This hinders the development of DSMs for high performance OTFTs. In this thesis two systematic approaches will be presented. DSMs were chosen by knowledge, which means that suitable DSMs were identified by a knowledge driven process. In addition, novel dielectrics were designed and synthesized specifically for this thesis. In case of DSMs chosen by knowledge, we were able to show that different DSMs can be classified into three types: low adhesion DSMs, high adhesion DSMs and intermediate DSMs. Perlyene films produced on low adhesion DSMs grow in highly textured films with large grains while perylene films produced on high adhesion DSMs show a perturbed growth mode which leads to an inferior film quality. The film quality of perylene films grown on intermediate DSMs lies between these two extremes. Furthermore, the measurements show that perylene OTFTs based on low adhesion DSMs outperform all other perylene based OTFTs. The application of novel dielectrics, based on derivates of tridecyltrichlorosilane (TTS) with different functional end-groups aimed at the specific tailoring of the adhesion energy, which is assumed to be the major factor in producing high performance OTFTs. The experiments confirm the importance of an educated choice of an appropriate DSM. We were able to tailor the adhesion energy of perylene molecules on a substrate by the application of deliberately designed DSMs. It was confirmed that perylene based OTFTs on carefully chosen DSMs outperform TFTs without DSM in terms of charge carrier mobility and film quality. This is indicative for an influence of the DSMs on the trap-state distribution and on the thin-film formation process. Both influences were investigated in detail. In case of the thin-film formation process, the influence of DSMs on film perfection was unraveled. We were able to show that the difference in adhesion energy for different DSMs influences the diffusivity. This is also influencing the island density and hence the film perfection. Furthermore, the influence of the balance between adhesion and cohesive energy on the growth of the first monolayers was demonstrated. The influence of DSMs on the trap-state distribution at the DSM/organic interface was investigated in detail. To explain all observed time- and temperature dependent effects in perylene TFTs, a model was developed that predicts the existence of states in the vicinity of the perylene HOMO level that need energy in order to be filled and in order to be emptied. By the application of a novel variation of temperature stimulated current (TSC) we were able to confirm the existence of this energy level. It was shown that the existence of trap states has a huge impact on charge carrier transport and in turn on device performance and that different DSMs lead to a different trap state density and distribution...|$|R
