In his Bedford speech in July 1957 he told the nation they had 'never had it so good', but warned of the dangers of inflation, summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s.

25|$|In the United States, 10.2 {{million are}} {{estimated}} to experience angina with approximately 500,000 new cases occurring each year. Angina is more often the presenting symptom of coronary artery disease in women than in men. The prevalence of angina rises with increasing age, {{with a mean age}} of onset of 62.3 years. After five years post-onset, 4.8% of individuals with angina subsequently died from coronary heart disease. Men with angina were found to have an increased risk of subsequent acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease related death than women. Similar figures apply in the remainder of the Western world. All forms of coronary heart disease are much less-common in the Third World, as its risk factors are much more common in Western and Westernized countries; it could, therefore, be termed a disease <b>of</b> <b>affluence.</b> The adoption of a rich, Westernized diet and subsequent increase of smoking, obesity, and other risk factors has led to an increase in angina and related diseases in countries such as China.|$|E
25|$|Paleolithic peoples {{suffered}} less {{famine and}} malnutrition than the Neolithic farming tribes that followed them. This was partly because Paleolithic hunter-gatherers accessed {{a wider variety}} natural foods, which allowed them a more nutritious diet and a decreased risk of famine. Many of the famines experienced by Neolithic (and some modern) farmers were caused or amplified by their dependence on {{a small number of}} crops. It is thought that wild foods can have a significantly different nutritional profile than cultivated foods. The greater amount of meat obtained by hunting big game animals in Paleolithic diets than Neolithic diets may have also allowed Paleolithic hunter-gatherers to enjoy a more nutritious diet than Neolithic agriculturalists. It has been argued that the shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture resulted in an increasing focus on a limited variety of foods, with meat likely taking a back seat to plants. It is also unlikely that Paleolithic hunter-gatherers were affected by modern diseases <b>of</b> <b>affluence</b> such as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease, because they ate mostly lean meats and plants and frequently engaged in intense physical activity, and because the average lifespan was shorter than the age of common onset of these conditions.|$|E
25|$|Since TCM recognizes bear bile as a medicinal, {{more than}} 12,000 asiatic black bears {{are held in}} bear farms. The bile is {{extracted}} through a permanent hole in the abdomen leading to the gall bladder, which can cause severe pain. This can lead to bears trying to kill themselves. As of 2012, approximately 10,000 bears are farmed in China for their bile. This practice has spurred public outcry across the country. The bile is collected from live bears via a surgical procedure. The deer penis {{is believed to have}} therapeutic benefits according to traditional Chinese medicine. It is typically very big and, proponents believe, in order to preserve its properties, it should be extracted from a living deer. Medicinal tiger parts from poached animals include tiger penis, believed to improve virility, and tiger eyes. The illegal trade for tiger parts in China has driven the species to near-extinction because of its popularity in traditional medicine. Laws protecting even critically endangered species such as the Sumatran tiger fail to stop the display and sale of these items in open markets. Shark fin soup is traditionally regarded in Chinese medicine as beneficial for health in East Asia, and its status as an elite dish has led to huge demand with the increase <b>of</b> <b>affluence</b> in China, devastating shark populations. The shark fins {{have been a part of}} traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Shark finning is banned in many countries, but the trade is thriving in Hong Kong and China, where the fins are part of shark fin soup, a dish considered a delicacy, and used in some types of traditional Chinese medicine.|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} 1920s, the Agnews prospered. Theodore {{acquired}} a larger restaurant, the Piccadilly, {{and moved the}} family to {{a house in the}} Forest Park section of the city, where Spiro attended Garrison Junior High School and later Forest Park High School. This period <b>of</b> <b>affluence</b> ended with the crash of 1929, and the restaurant closed. In 1931 the family's savings were wiped out when a local bank failed, forcing them to sell the house and move to a small apartment. Agnew later recalled how his father responded to these misfortunes: [...] "He just shrugged it off and went to work with his hands without complaint." [...] Theodore Agnew sold fruit and vegetables from a roadside stall, while the youthful Spiro helped the family's budget with part-time jobs, delivering groceries and distributing leaflets. As he grew up, Spiro was increasingly influenced by his youthful peers, and began to distance himself from his Greek background. He refused his father's offer to pay for Greek language lessons, and preferred to be known by a nickname, [...] "Ted".|$|E
500|$|When George {{was about}} three years old, {{the family moved to}} Calgary for a while to be near Frances' ailing mother, and he formed {{memories}} of events such as the Calgary Stampede. When George was six, the family returned to the United States and moved to Mitchell, South Dakota, a community of 12,000. McGovern attended public schools there and was an average student. He was painfully shy as a child and was afraid to speak in class during first grade. His only reproachable behavior was going to see movies, which were among the worldly amusements forbidden to good Wesleyan Methodists. Otherwise he had a normal childhood marked by visits to the renowned Mitchell Corn Palace and what he later termed [...] "a sense of belonging to a particular place and knowing your part in it". He would, however, long remember the Dust Bowl storms and grasshopper plagues that swept the prairie states during the Great Depression. The McGovern family lived {{on the edge of the}} poverty line for much of the 1920s and 1930s. Growing up amid that lack <b>of</b> <b>affluence</b> gave young George a lifelong sympathy for underpaid workers and struggling farmers.

2500|$|Malthusian ideas {{continue}} to have considerable influence. Paul R.

In the late 1960s Ehrlich predicted that hundreds of millions would die from a coming overpopulation-crisis in the 1970s. Other examples of work that has been accused of [...] "Malthusianism" [...] include the 1972 book The Limits to Growth (published by the Club of Rome) and the Global 2000 report to the then President of the United States Jimmy Carter. Science-fiction author Isaac Asimov issued many appeals for population-control reflecting the perspective articulated by people from Robert Malthus through Paul R. Ehrlich.|$|E
2500|$|Dan Gardner {{argues that}} Ehrlich has been insufficiently forthright in {{acknowledging}} errors he made, while being intellectually dishonest or evasive in taking credit for things {{he claims he}} got [...] "right". For example, he rarely acknowledges the mistakes he made in predicting material shortages, massive death tolls from starvation (as many as one billion in the publication Age <b>of</b> <b>Affluence)</b> or regarding the disastrous effects on specific countries. Meanwhile, he is happy to claim credit for [...] "predicting" [...] the increase of AIDS or global warming. However, {{in the case of}} disease, Ehrlich had predicted the increase of a disease based on overcrowding, or the weakened immune systems of starving people, so it is [...] "a stretch to see this as forecasting the emergence of AIDS in the 1980s." [...] Similarly, global warming was one of the scenarios that Ehrlich described, so claiming credit for it, while disavowing responsibility for failed scenarios is a double standard. Gardner believes that Ehrlich is displaying classical signs of cognitive dissonance, and that his failure to acknowledge obvious errors of his own judgement render his current thinking suspect.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of environmental values across countries. Its purpose {{is to put the}} role <b>of</b> economic <b>affluence</b> into perspective by challenging the conventional wisdom that states that the level <b>of</b> economic <b>affluence</b> influences the level of environmental concern expressed by the population. While this paper does not question the fact that large scale environmental defensive activities are likely to be influenced by the level of income in a country, it is hypothesized that environmental awareness and individual involvement in environmental protection need not be a function of the level <b>of</b> economic <b>affluence.</b> To test this hypothesis, three variables are created-Positive Environmental Attitudes, Willingness to Pay to Protect the Environment, and Human-Environment Relationship-using data from the World Values Survey (1995 - 1997). The variables are regressed against a set of economic, demographic, political, psychological and education variables. The results show that economic affluence has, at best, a marginal direct influence on environmental awareness and no direct impact on environmental behavior. The paper demonstrates that the degree of urbanization, the level of subjective well-being and the level of income equality have direct effects on awareness, while education, population pressure and happiness are significantly correlated with environmental behavior. ...|$|R
