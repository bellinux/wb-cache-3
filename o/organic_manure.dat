This study comprised of four field experiments {{on the use}} of organic amendments for growing wheat cv. Bhakkar 2002 to find out their impact on crop growth, yield, nutrients contents and soil characteristics. First experiment compared the efficiency of various <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> applied singly and in combination treatments on pre- green <b>manured</b> soil. The <b>organic</b> sources used in the experiment were: farmyard manure (FYM), poultry litter (PL), press mud (PM) and sewage sludge (SS) @ 20 t ha– 1. Two years’ data (2004 - 05 and 2005 - 06) on crop growth and yield attributes revealed that PL alone performed the best, and FYM alone gave lowest results. Combined application of PL with other <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> gave lower growth and yield of wheat, while integration of FYM with other organic materials improved its effectiveness. Soil bulk density was not affected significantly by any treatment of <b>organic</b> <b>manures.</b> Contrastingly, FYM and PM alone or combined gave lower N contents in soil; whereas, soil P contents were greater with SS, PL alone and their integration with other organic amendments. Soil and plant K contents were higher under PL, PM and their integration with other organic amendments, while SS gave the lowest results. The highest N and P contents in wheat grain and straw were found with SS, PL alone and their integration with other organic amendments. Generally, PL alone and combined with SS performed better than all other treatments for wheat production. In Experiment-II residual effects of various <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> treatments used in Experiment-I were evaluated for two seasons (2005 - 06 and 2006 - 07). Crop growth and yield parameters were higher with PL+PM and FYM+PM; while, FYM performed the least. Application of PL, SS alone and combined together enhanced N and P contents in soil and plants; while PM / FYM lowered them. Potassium contents in soil and plants were higher under PL, PM and their integration, while SS gave the lowest contents. Residual effect of PL alone or combined with other <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> especially SS and FYM was greater than all other treatments for wheat. Combined application of PL and FYM with other <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> improved their effectiveness. In Experiment-III, efficiency of <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> used as in Experiment- 1 was compared on wheat straw pre-manured soil in 2005 - 06 and 2006 - 07. Data on various growth attributes of crop indicated that sole use of all the <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> (FYM, PL, PM, SS) performed better than their combined application, and PL alone out-performed over others. However, yield and yield contributing parameters responded better to the integration of these organic amendments; among them PL+SS and PL+PM gave better results. Use of PL+PM and PM+SS lowered the soil bulk density significantly and to the maximum. Application of PL, SS both alone and combined increased N and P contents in soil and plants over others. Soil and plant K contents were highest under PL, PM alone and their integration, while SS and its combinations gave the lowest K contents. On the overall, PL used alone or in combination with other <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> especially SS was superior to all other treatments. Fourth experiment compared the efficiency of NPK fertilizers, PL alone and other <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> (FYM, PM, SS) used in combination with PL and with each other under different available soil moisture depletion levels (ASDLs) on wheat straw pre-manured soil during 2005 - 06 and 2006 - 07). Interactions of ASDLs and <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> showed that PL alone and NPK fertilizer under ASDL 2 (65 %) followed by PL+PM+SS gave higher growth measurements and production of wheat. It was concluded that PL whether used alone or integrated with other <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> is the best for growing wheat in green manured as well as straw incorporated soil. Further, PL should be used at 65 % ASMDL for having higher wheat production under rain-fed conditions...|$|R

(2007) who reported that soil amended with <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> accumulated significantly more nitrate than soil without <b>organic</b> <b>manures.</b> Biological process like immobilization in which microbial community use part of the available nitrate as energy source during the mineralization could be the reason for the non-significance in the nitrate nitrogen of soil amended with ash relative to soil amended with dried manures. The significant increase in NO 3 −–N under field condition may be attributed to the fact that NPK contained the available form of nitrogen as NO 3 −–N and the sharp increase at 2 WAI was because it was incorporated at 2 WAI. The low NO 3 −–N stimulated by NPK at subsequent weeks after could be attributed to leaching or uptake of available nitrogen. This is supported with the findings of Adeniyan et al.
