And that was really weird for me because there's so many people of South Asian descent in America – in the world. I didn't want to be this stereotype of what Indian people are usually seen as in global pop culture. We don't just have to be Apu from The Simpsons." [...] After being given all 26 pilot scripts which ABC was filming for the 2015–2016 television season, she chose Quantico. The actress, who had appeared in over fifty films at that time, was required to audition for the first time, which she found nerve-wracking. Safran was impressed by Chopra's audition, which helped him re-envision the character, adding [...] "She walked into the room, and it was like the molecules shifted in that way that superstars have. I was very confused because I didn't know who she was, but we all sat up straighter. We're like this is clearly a movie star; it's like every hair on the back <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>neck</b> stands up watching her act. When I went back home I couldn't think about anyone else." [...] Chopra became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I think that when you get more than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't want to go and remake any of our past records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe That Smile Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release. While satisfied with the recorded material at first, with time the band became more critical of it and decided they would only be demos. They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them. [...] "Even though we loved the energy of what we'd done, not enough of the songs were making the hair stand up on the back <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>neck</b> and so we realized that we needed to do more work," [...] bass player Duncan Coutts explained. They decided to postpone the album's release until June and then August to continue recording.|$|E

He added that humans and dinosaurs had lived together, quoting Clifford L. Burdick for the report that dinosaur tracks had supposedly been found overlapping a human track in the Paluxy River bed Glen Rose Formation.

But he had also made up his mind that his life was not to be pauperized because he had had to renounce one sort of joy; rather, he had begun life again with a new counting-up of the treasures that remained to him, and he had even felt a release of power such as may come from ceasing to be afraid <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own <b>neck.</b>|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, {{ties are}} {{a staple of}} office attire, {{especially}} for professionals. Proponents of the tie's place in the office assert that ties neatly demarcate work and leisure time. The {{theory is that the}} physical presence <b>of</b> something around <b>your</b> <b>neck</b> serves as a reminder to knuckle down and focus on the job at hand. Conversely, loosening of the tie after work signals that one can relax. However, some tech companies have gone the other way and banned neckties in the office, such as in Google, Amazon, Apple, and Ikea. Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, believes ties are a symbol of oppression and slavery. Outside of these progressive environments, ties are usually worn especially when attending traditionally formal or professional events, including weddings, important religious ceremonies, funerals, job interviews, court appearances, and fine dining.|$|R

50|$|Injuries are a {{major factor}} {{when it comes to}} hydroflight sports {{especially}} when the pilot starts to perform advanced movements. Injuries can occur at absolutely any time <b>of</b> <b>your</b> flight. • Hitting the pressurized hose at speed can cause concussion, bruising and even broken toes / ankles / legs. • Diving into the water presents the danger <b>of</b> breaking <b>your</b> <b>neck,</b> concussion, dislocation <b>of</b> shoulders / back or neck, and if the pilot attempts to scoop the trajectory of the dive underwater against his current rotation he will be at serious risk of a back injury.• Hitting the water flat (non-diving position) from a height of 10 meters will bring the pilot to a stop in less than 1 foot which can cause serious bruising to your body and internal organs, it also strains the connective tissue securing the organs and possible minor haemorrhaging of lungs and other tissue is also possible.• According to the website Hyper Physics (impact force of falling object generator), if a fully kitted up pilot with the weight of 75 kg fell from a full height of 16 meters (without the help of forward momentum or the force of the jets pushing them) he would hit the water at approximately 63 km/h. Yet most professionals weigh between 75 - 90 kg once fully kitted up.• Whilst performing manoeuvres such as back flips or front flips the pilot can reach up to 4 Gs of force.|$|R
