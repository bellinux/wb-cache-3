However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10.

In the application of EMO algorithms to some multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems, there exit a large number of <b>overlapping</b> solutions in each generation. We examine the effect of removing <b>overlapping</b> solutions on the performance of EMO algorithms. In this paper, <b>overlapping</b> solutions are removed from the current population except for a single solution. We implement two removal strategies of <b>overlapping</b> solutions. One is the removal of <b>overlapping</b> solutions in the objective space. In this strategy, one solution is randomly chosen among the <b>overlapping</b> solutions with the same objective vector and left in the current population. The other <b>overlapping</b> solutions with the same objective vector are removed from the current population. As a result, each solution in the current population has a different location in the objective space. It {{should be noted that the}} <b>overlapping</b> solutions in the objective space are not necessary the same solution in the decision space. Thus we also examine the other strategy where the <b>overlapping</b> solutions in the decision space are removed from the current population except for a single solution. As a result, each solution in the current population has a different location in the decision space. The effect of removing <b>overlapping</b> solutions is examined through computational experiments where each removal strategy is combined into the NSGA-II algorithm. ...|$|R
