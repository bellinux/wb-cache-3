People with Tourette's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor. Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals from all walks <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>are</b> found among people with Tourette's. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was misunderstood, punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children who enjoyed an understanding and supportive environment.|$|E

Human biologists could learn about extraterrestrial biochemistry and observe how it differs from that found on Earth.

5|$|The {{cladistic}} method (or cladism) {{has emerged}} since the 1960s. In 1958, Julian Huxley {{used the term}} clade. Later, in 1960, Cain and Harrison introduced the term cladistic. The salient feature is arranging taxa in a hierarchical evolutionary tree, ignoring ranks. A taxon is called monophyletic, if it includes all the descendants of an ancestral form. Groups that have descendant groups removed from them (e.g. dinosaurs, with birds as offspring group) are termed paraphyletic, while groups representing more than one branch from the tree <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>are</b> called polyphyletic. The International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature or PhyloCode is intended to regulate the formal naming of clades. Linnaean ranks will be optional under the PhyloCode, which is intended to coexist with the current, rank-based codes.|$|E
5|$|Throughout a {{great and}} open area, not only {{will there be a}} greater chance of {{favourable}} variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>are</b> much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more important role in the changing history of the organic world.|$|E

40|$|Background Satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and {{wellbeing}} <b>is</b> {{shown to}} be important when the quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> to be understood. The nurse has {{a significant role in}} the care of the patient and in his/her experience <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Aim The purpose of this study is to examine the quality <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> from a nurse perspective. Method The text analysis was carried out with qualified attempts, of a book, "Quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> a challenge for the nurse" (in Swedish) by T. Rustoen, a nurse who also worked as a teacher in Norway. The book describes how quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> experienced from the patients and staffs view. Results The text analysis showed that out of the ordinary descriptions <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> the author found four new themes. These themes where; the meaning of solidarity, confidence, activity and meaningfulness in the existence. Conclusion Quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> an important word, which means different to different kind of people. For people in common, quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> usually means: happiness, harmony and comfort, but as been showed includes more. Quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> a complex purpose, related to a subjective feeling of comfort and satisfaction...|$|R

25|$|And the Earth is not {{the only}} one that changed - the {{luminosity}} of the sun has increased over time. Because rocks record a history of relatively constant temperatures since Earth’s beginnings, there must have been more greenhouse gasses to keep the temperatures up in the Archean when the sun was younger and fainter. All these major differences in the environment of the Earth placed very different constraints on the evolution of life throughout our planet’s history.
