5|$|Even after {{becoming}} a bishop, Bloet continued to witness royal writs, witnessing six of Rufus' writs while bishop, {{to add to}} his 11 witnessed writs during his chancellorship. Bloet was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> in 1097 that attempted to persuade Anselm when the archbishop was in a dispute with Rufus over travelling to Rome to consult with the papacy. When Anselm refused to be persuaded not to go, the king ordered {{him to leave the}} kingdom, with the support of most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> and nobility.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{the arrest}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> {{has been seen}} as a turning point in Stephen's reign, and the event that turned the ecclesiastical {{hierarchy}} against him. Recent historians have held a lively debate on the issue; a few still hold to the traditional interpretation, but most have decided that reactions in the English church were more ambivalent. One modern historian, David Crouch, believes that the arrest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> signalled the beginnings of the Anarchy, not because of any alienation of the church, but through court politics, where Stephen showed himself incapable of manipulating the factions of his court. The ascendency of the Beaumonts was marked by the placement of one of their protégés, Philip de Harcourt, as Chancellor.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin and Hugh were {{in exile}} {{together}} in Bordeaux in 1212, {{but they both}} returned to England in May 1213, {{along with the other}} English bishops. Jocelin was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> in August 1214 who refused to pay a scutage to the king. In 1215, Jocelin sided with Stephen Langton and the barons, and Magna Charta lists Jocelin as one of the king's councillors.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> that crowned John's son Henry III, and {{throughout}} the rest of Jocelin's life was involved in royal administration. He was also active in his diocese, ordering construction on the cathedral at Wells, and issuing rules for his diocesan clergy. During his time as bishop, he settled a dispute between his diocese and Glastonbury Abbey that had started during the bishopric of his predecessor. The memorial brass on his tomb in Wells Cathedral {{is probably one of the}} earliest in England.|$|E

25|$|It {{is likely}} that <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tomb {{monument}} itself, which was made almost a decade later, was by Jerôme's own hand. The monument is placed in an architectural frame {{of black and white}} marble and depicts Mary and Christ looking down on <b>the</b> effigy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> reclining on a sarcophagus. <b>The</b> portrait <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> in <b>the</b> monument is particularly fine although some have compared it unfavourably with <b>the</b> earlier bust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bishop.</b>|$|R

5|$|John was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> that {{sided with}} King William against Anselm of Canterbury at the king's Whitsun council in 1097, one of early councils called during the Investiture Controversy in England. During {{the reign of}} King Henry I, who succeeded his brother King William in 1100, John along with Robert Bloet, the Bishop of Lincoln, consecrated abbots who had been {{invested}} in office by the king. John attended Anselm's reforming Council of London in 1102, which debated and passed decrees to reform the clergy.|$|E
5|$|King Coenwulf of Mercia {{may have}} {{supported}} the unfortunate Ealhmund, and Symeon of Durham wrote that in 801:Eardwulf, king of the Northumbrians, led an army against Coenwulf, king of Mercians, because he had given asylum to his enemies. He also, collecting an army, obtained very many auxiliaries from other provinces, having made a long expedition among them. At length, with the advice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> and chiefs of the Angles on either side, they made peace through the kindness of {{the king of the}} Angles.|$|E
5|$|King Stephen gave {{permission}} {{for some of}} England's bishops, including Bethune, to attend the Council of Reims in 1148. Stephen had expelled the papal legates, or representatives, who arrived in England to summon the bishops to Reims, and after that appointed three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> as representatives of the English Church. These three, Bethune, Hilary of Chichester, and William de Turbeville, were allowed to attend the council. Theobald of Bec was expressly forbidden to attend, {{but he managed to}} evade those watching him and arrived in Reims along with his clerk, Thomas Becket.|$|E

50|$|The opening is {{characterized}} by advancing early in <b>the</b> game <b>the</b> <b>bishop's</b> head pawn on 8g to 8f if played by Black or on 2c to 2d if played by White, {{in which it is}} undefended. This is a daring move since <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bishop</b> (<b>the</b> 8g or 2c square) needs to be defended from a Static Rook attack and moving <b>the</b> <b>bishop's</b> head pawn forward increases <b>the</b> vulnerability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bishop's</b> head.|$|R

5|$|Later Sulien, now Bishop of St David's (he was bishop 1073–1078 and 1080–1086), himself {{took refuge}} at Llanbadarn Fawr from the Vikings who were raiding St David's. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> were murdered by raiders and marauders, {{including}} Bishop Morgeneu I (also known as Morgenveth, Morgeney, Uregeneu) in 999 and Bishop Abraham (who had been newly elected to succeed Sulien) in 1080.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{granted to}} Alexander the {{land on which}} the Old Palace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> stands in Lincoln, {{although}} {{it is unclear whether}} it was Alexander or his successor as bishop who began the construction of the existing building. Stephen's grant added to an earlier one by King Henry, of the Eastgate in Lincoln as an episcopal residence. Work commissioned by Alexander has survived at the three castles he built at Newark-on-Trent, Sleaford, and probably Banbury.|$|E
5|$|Wells {{was listed}} in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Welle, from the Old English wiells, not as a town but as four manors with a {{population}} of 132, which implies a population of 500–600. Earlier names for the settlement have been identified which include Fontanetum, in a charter of 725 granted by King Ina to Glastonbury and Fontanensis Ecclesia. Tidesput or Tithesput furlang relates to the area east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> garden in 1245. Wells was part of, and gave its name to, the hundred of Wells Forum.|$|E

5|$|A royal {{charter of}} 1215 gave Wellington {{its status as}} a town, and during the medieval period it grew as a centre for trade on the road from Bristol to Exeter, being laid out, with the church at the east end of town, in a similar manner to other towns of this era. In 1548, the manor was sold to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, but reverted to the control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> after his execution. By the end of the 16th century it had come under the {{protection}} of John Popham (judge) and his descendants who built a manor house which was destroyed during the English Civil War.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman Conquest, Gisa {{supported}} William, the {{new king}} of England. He helped consecrate Lanfranc as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1070, and attended the Council of Windsor in 1072 and the Council of London in 1075. At a later church council, Giso asserted his {{authority over the}} abbots of Muchelney and Athelney, but failed to uphold the same claim in regards to Thurstan, Abbot of Glastonbury. Previously, he was credited {{as the author of}} Historiola de primordiis episcopatus Somersetensis, a history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> of Wells, but he is no longer considered the author of that work.|$|E
5|$|Arundel House was {{originally}} the town house <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bishops</b> of Bath and Wells.

After Seymour was executed in 1549, the property was sold to Henry FitzAlan, Earl of Arundel, and was owned by the Earldom {{for much of the}} 16th and 17th century. In 1666, it became the meeting place of the Royal Society after the Great Fire of London destroyed their previous venue. The house was demolished in 1678 and Arundel Street, adjoining the Strand, was built on the site.|$|E
