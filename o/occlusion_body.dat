40|$|Substitution of granulin {{from the}} Trichoplusia ni {{granulosis}} virus (TnGV) for polyhedrin of the Autographa californica multinucleocapsid {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} (AcMNPV) yielded a few very large (2 to 5 μm) cuboidal inclusions in the cytoplasm and nucleus of infected cells. These polyhedra lacked the beveled edges characteristic of wild-type AcMNPV polyhedra, contained fractures, and occluded few virions. Placing a nuclear localization signal (KRKK) in granulin directed more granulin to the nucleus and resulted in more structurally uniform cuboidal inclusions in which no virions were observed. A granulin-polyhedrin chimera produced tetrahedral occlusions with more virions than granulin inclusions but many fewer than wild-type polyhedra. Despite the unusual structure of the granulin and granulin-polyhedrin inclusions, they interacted with AcMNPV p 10 fibrillar structures and electron-dense spacers that are precursors of the polyhedral calyx. The change in inclusion shape obtained with the granulin-polyhedrin chimera demonstrates that the primary amino acid sequence affects <b>occlusion</b> <b>body</b> shape, but the large cuboidal inclusions formed by granulin indicate that the amino acid sequence {{is not the only}} determinant. The failure of granulin or the granulin-polyhedrin chimera to properly occlude AcMNPV virions suggests that specific interactions occur between polyhedrin and other viral proteins which facilitate normal virion occlusion and <b>occlusion</b> <b>body</b> assembly and shape in baculoviruses...|$|E

The major constituent protein of <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> from the baculovirus Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus is polyhedrin, and assembly of recombinant <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> which incorporate a foreign protein depends {{on an interaction between}} native polyhedrin and a polyhedrin–foreign protein fusion.

Viral proteins were electrophoresed in polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with viral antisera, and the antibodies were detected with 125 I-labeled Staphylococcus aureus protein A. Antisera were prepared to purified and intact virions from five baculoviruses: Autographa californica, Porthetria dispar, Trichoplusia ni, and Heliothis zea nuclear polyhedrosis viruses (NPVs) and T. ni granulosis virus (GV).

Its product, Ac 92, is {{a functional}} sulfhydryl oxidase. Deletion of ac 92 results in almost negligible levels of budded virus (BV) production, defects in occlusion-derived virus (ODV) co-envelopment and their inefficient incorporation into <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> To determine {{the role of}} sulfhydryl oxidation {{in the production of}} BV, envelopment of nucleocapsids, and nucleocapsid incorporation into <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies,</b> the Trichoplusia ni single nucleopolyhedrovirus ortholog, tn 79, was substituted for ac 92.

A case in point: research on baculoviruses. Baculoviruses are rod-shaped DNA viruses, many of which begin their life cycle reproducing inside cells. In the nuclei of caterpillar cells infected with baculoviruses, viral progeny multiply and are incorporated into protective polyhedronshaped protein structures called <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> Infected caterpillars die and contaminate the leaf surfaces with the <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> Then, healthy caterpillars ingest the <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> and release the virus when feeding on contaminated leaves, thus continuing the life cycle of infection and replication. “Each year, natural baculovirus epidemics nearly wipe out populations of some caterpillar pests, such as corn earworm, cotton bollworm, tobacco budworm, and cabbage’s nemesis—the diamondback moth,” says ARS microbiologist Arthur H.

40|$|A novel protein {{which is}} {{expressed}} {{at high levels}} in insect cells infected with Amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus was identified by our laboratory. This viral gene product migrates as a 25 / 27 -kDa doublet when subjected to electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. It is expressed at late times of infection and is present in infected cells but is absent in purified extracellular virions and <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> The gene encoding this polypeptide was mapped on the viral genome, and cDNA clones were generated and sequenced. The predicted protein was shown to be phosphorylated and contained an unusual 10 -unit proline-glutamic acid repeat element. A polyclonal antiserum was produced against a recombinant form of the protein expressed in Escherichia coli, and a monoclonal antibody which reacted with the proline-glutamic acid motif was also identified. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy techniques revealed that this protein is associated with large cytoplasmic fibrils which accumulate in the cytoplasm between 96 and 120 h postinfection. We subsequently called this viral polypeptide filament-associated late protein of entomopoxvirus. The fibrils containing this polypeptide are closely associated with <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> and {{may play a role}} in their morphogenesis and maturation...|$|R
