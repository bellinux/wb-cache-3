50|$|The tribrach is {{attached}} to the tripod and placed over the monument. Looking through the <b>optical</b> <b>plummet</b> pick up two of the tripod legs and position the cross hairs over the monument. Tread all three legs into the grass, bitumen, concrete. Look through the <b>optical</b> <b>plummet</b> and using the thumbscrews put the cross hairs back over the monument. Adjust the level of the tribrach by slackening the tripod screws and sliding the legs. Re-center the cross hairs using the thumb screws, then fine-tune the level using the tripod legs. Once the tribrach is nearly centered over the monument, level the tribrach the last little bit using the thumbscrews. Slacken the tribrach from the tripod head and slide it the last 4-5mm so that it is centered over the monument and level. If the target over which the instrument is to be placed is roughly at the same elevation as the tripod feet, the preceding technique is applicable. However, if there is a considerable difference between the elevation of the target and the elevation of the tripod feet, such as when the target is in a deep hole or raised on a shelf or wall, it will not work, as the target will appear to move laterally by a large distance in the <b>optical</b> <b>plummet</b> as the tripod legs are raised or lowered.|$|E
50|$|Some modern total {{stations}} have a laser plummet {{which allows the}} instrument to be levelled and positioned vertically over a survey monument or ground control point. Other tribrachs have an <b>optical</b> <b>plummet</b> with either a bullseye or cross hair sight for positioning the instrument. The oldest tribrachs required a plumb line {{to allow them to}} be positioned vertically over a point and were slower to set up.|$|E
50|$|A {{theodolite}} {{is mounted}} on its tripod head {{by means of a}} forced centering plate or tribrach containing four thumbscrews, or in modern theodolites, three for rapid leveling. Before use, a theodolite must be precisely placed vertically above the point to be measured using a plumb bob, <b>optical</b> <b>plummet</b> or laser plummet. The instrument is then set level using leveling footscrews and circular and more precise tubular spirit bubbles.|$|E
50|$|The device {{consists}} of two triangular metal plates connected at their corners by leveling thumbscrews, a bubble level, a locking mechanism and often an <b>optical</b> <b>plummet.</b> The centre of the bottom plate of the tribrach has a 5/8-11 UNC thread bolt hole {{which is used to}} attach the tribrach to the tripod. The top plate of the tribrach has three small holes or slots spaced at 120 degrees above leveling thumbscrews, and a locking mechanism which enables a survey instrument to be placed on the tribrach and locked in place.|$|E
40|$|At present {{extensive}} underground {{construction works}} {{take place at}} the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. In the context of the Large Hadron Collider project (LHC), connecting tunnels between the existing ring accelerators LEP and SPS are built on the one hand. On the other hand further tunnels are constructed for the CNGS project (CERN neutrinos to Gran Sasso). Already for the excavation works highest accuracy demands were stated. Thus, the real axis of the tunnels must be centred within a 50 mm radius circle in the theoretical axis. The main difficulty {{from the point of view}} of surveying is the orientation transfer from the surface reference network to the tunnels, since tunnelling is started from shafts. A further crucial aspect of the survey are lateral refraction effects due to the small diameters of the tunnels (3 m). Grunder Ingenieure AG based in Hasle-RÃ¼egsau, Switzerland, were mandated to carry out survey checks of the contractor's primary survey. Controlled traverses in the tunnels and trigonometric networks in and around the shafts are measured. Further, the plumbings in the shafts are independently controlled by an <b>optical</b> <b>plummet.</b> The height transfer in the tunnel...|$|E
