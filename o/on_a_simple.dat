5|$|An electoral {{division}} {{which is a}} GRC returns the number of MPs designated for the constituency by the President to serve in Parliament. A group of individuals standing together in a GRC is voted for as a team, and not as individual candidates. In other words, a successful voter's single vote in an SMC sends to Parliament one MP, and a GRC sends a group of MPs depending on how many have been designated for that GRC. All elected MPs are selected <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> plurality voting ("first past the post") basis.|$|E
5|$|Beresford visited several {{schools and}} auditioned many {{children}} {{for the role of}} Sonny before he came across Allan Hubbard in Paris, Texas. Beresford said Hubbard, like Harper, was chosen based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple,</b> rural quality he possessed. The boy was able to relate easily to the character because, like Sonny, his father died at an early age; later, some media reports falsely claimed that his father was killed during the Vietnam War, just as Sonny's was in the film's backstory. None of the filmmakers knew Hubbard's father had died until after filming began. Duvall developed a strong, trusting relationship with Hubbard, which Foote felt improved the duo's on-screen chemistry. Hubbard would often play guitar with Duvall during breaks from filming.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, the {{mechanics}} of how dew condenses were much better understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best. A number of researchers worked on this method. In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of polyethylene supported <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived much better than the control group planted without such aids– they all dried up over the summer. In 1986 in New Mexico condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.|$|E

5|$|Rare co-founder Tim Stamper {{conceptualized}} a gardening {{game for}} the handheld Pocket PC platform in 2002. A three-person team began work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> prototype while the company was still affiliated with Nintendo, prior to its Microsoft acquisition. Development transferred to the original Xbox and, ultimately, to the Xbox 360 for its enhanced graphical capabilities. The development team wanted its animals to have a unified style, which was how the concept artist arrived at the piñata conceit. The idea was exciting for the team, as piñatas were not commonplace in the United Kingdom. The connection between piñatas and candy-filled insides led to new gameplay directions.|$|E

5|$|Before Crisis was {{the first}} {{original}} video game developed by Square Enix exclusively for mobile phones, originally released on NTT DoCoMo's FOMA mobile devices, and the first action role-playing game exclusive to the platform. The company's first major mobile title, also in collaboration with NTT DoCoMo, was a remake of the original Final Fantasy. Using {{lessons learned from the}} development of the Final Fantasy port, the team worked hard to make Before Crisis a uniquely mobile experience, with gameplay features built to exploit mobile functions such as the camera and network capacity. The camera function used to generate Materia was based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> image recognition that specifies the Materia generated based on the picture's general color. One of the challenges during development was to keep the framerate smooth during moments of high action, especially as no two mobiles would have identical components. In addition to these problems were issues with integrating the multiplayer functions, balancing the gameplay for different playstyles, creating a comfortable button layout, and adjusting the amount of content they could include for mobiles while maintaining the desired product quality.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at the USDA, Thom became a world {{authority}} on the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. Thom pioneered the technique of using defined, reproducible culture media to grow microorganisms; most of the taxa he described are still valid today. Together with Margaret B. Church, Thom maintained collections of fungus cultures for the American Type Culture Collection, established in 1925. In 1929, a year after discovering penicillin, Alexander Fleming published a well-known paper in which he identified the mold Penicillium rubrum as the one responsible for creating the drug. Harold Raistrick succeeded in growing the organism <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> culture medium, but could not isolate the penicillin produced by the mold when grown this way. With Thom's assistance, they correctly identified the organism as Penicillium notatum and, in 1941, developed a method to scale up production at the Department of Agriculture's Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria, Illinois, which ultimately resulted in an inexpensive supply of the drug.|$|E

25|$|The {{measurement}} of the dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects among AAS is based largely <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> although arguably unsophisticated and outdated model involving rat tissue bioassays.

In this model, anabolic (myotrophic) activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat bulbocavernosus/levator ani muscle and androgenic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat ventral prostate (or, alternatively, the rat seminal vesicles) in response to exposure to the AAS, and the measurements are then compared and used to form a ratio.|$|E

25|$|The 46-caliber21-K was {{a minimal}} {{adaptation}} of the 53-K anti-tank gun that was created by taking the latter's barrel and mounting it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> pedestal mount. Its semi-automatic breech automatically ejected the cartridge case and locked open, {{ready for the next}} round. This was less than ideal for an anti-aircraft weapon that relied on its rate of fire to inflict damage on aircraft because every round had to be hand-loaded. Fully automatic weapons of roughly this caliber like the 40 mm Bofors typically used 4-5 round clips of ammunition to produce rates of fire four times as high.|$|E
25|$|A schema (pl. schemata) is {{the mental}} {{framework}} that is created as children {{interact with their}} physical and social environments.

According to Piaget, these children are operating based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> cognitive schema that things that move are alive. At any age, children rely on their current cognitive structures to understand the world around them. Moreover, younger and older children may often interpret and respond to the same objects and events in very different ways because cognitive structures take different forms at different ages.|$|E
