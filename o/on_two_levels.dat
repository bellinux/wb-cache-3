5|$|Passenger {{service has}} run to Readville {{continuously}} since the Boston and Providence Railroad opened in 1834. Separate stations <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>levels</b> were consolidated by the New Haven Railroad around 1898. Until 1958, the railroad had its heavy maintenance facilities located in Readville 5-Yard {{to the west}} of the station. The station building burned down in 1983, but the MBTA built replacement platforms and ramps in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Between 1998 and 2000, {{numerous}} airport {{expansion and}} renovation projects were completed, including a $25 million terminal renovation in 1998 that included additional retail shops, new flight information displays, enhanced lighting, upgraded flooring, {{and a new}} food court. Also, new hangars and office spaces were completed for NetJets in 1999, {{as well as a}} $92 million parking garage including an underground terminal entrance, new rental car facilities, dedicated ground transportation area, improved eight-lane terminal access <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>levels,</b> and a new atrium and entrances in 2000, which were designed by URS Corporation.|$|E
5|$|For {{lines with}} three or four tracks with express service, local stops will have side {{platforms}} and the middle one or two tracks will not stop at the station. On these lines, express stations typically have two island platforms, one for the local and express in one direction, and another for the local and express in the other direction. Each island platform provides a cross-platform interchange between local and express services. Some lines with four-track express service have two tracks each <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>levels</b> and use both island and side platforms.|$|E
40|$|We {{tackle the}} problem of online paging <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>level</b> {{memories}} with arbitrary associativity (including victim caches, skewed caches etc.). We show that some important classes of paging algorithms are not competitive on a wide class of associativities (even with arbitrary resource augmentation) and that although some algorithms designed for full associativity are actually competitive <b>on</b> any <b>two</b> <b>level</b> memory, the myopic behavior of paging algorithms designed for full associativity will generally result in very poor performance at least for some "associativity topologies". At {{the same time we}} present a simple and yet powerful technique that allows us to overcome this shortcoming, generalizing algorithms designed for full associativity into practical algorithms which are efficient <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>level</b> memories with arbitrary associativity. We identify a simple topological parameter, pseudo associativity, which characterizes the competitive ratio achievble <b>on</b> any <b>two</b> <b>level</b> memory, giving a lower bound on the competitiveness achievable by any paging algorithm and matching it within a factor 4 with a novel algorithm...|$|R

5|$|From 1898 to 1909, {{architect}} Frank Lloyd Wright {{lived and}} worked out of his home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois. In Oak Park, Wright had developed his concept of Prairie School architecture, designing houses primarily for local clients. In 1903, Wright began designing a home for Edwin Cheney, but quickly took a liking for Cheney's wife. Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney began an affair and separated from their spouses in 1909. They met up in Florence, Italy, in February 1910, where Wright made sketches of his future studio. He was particularly inspired by Michelozzo's Villa Medici in Fiesole because it was built into a hill, had commanding views of its surroundings, and featured gardens <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Torah ark had the {{capacity}} to house 50 Torah scrolls and was built <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>levels.</b> It was flanked by four Corinthian columns surrounded by baroque woodcuts depicting flowers and birds. The Ark, together with its ornamental gates, were taken from the Nikolayevsky Synagogue in Kherson, Russia, which had been used by Russian Jewish conscripts forced to spend twenty-five years in the Imperial Russian Army. Directly above the Ark was a triangular window with rounded points. To the right and in front of the ark was the cantor's podium, which was designed as a miniature version of the two-level Ark.|$|E

It includes the Genesis Youth Theatre Group, Operatic Society, Pantomime Group, Civic Players, Arcadians and the Spectrum Arts And Crafts. The Wellesley Cinema was built in 1937, in the traditional Art Deco style of that period. The auditorium seats 400 people <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>levels</b> and is run as an independent cinema.|$|E
