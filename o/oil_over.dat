5|$|Overall {{the attackers}} lost six bombers and 12 Bf 109s, some 12.5% of its strength. However, the British claimed 81 aircraft, 26 by the Duxford Wing. Zehbe's Dornier alone was claimed nine times. Among the German {{casualties}} {{that day was}} Rolf Heitsch and his flame throwing Dornier; the device had not been tested at high altitude and when used, squirted black <b>oil</b> <b>over</b> Holmes' windshield and {{attracted the attention of}} British fighters. Park would not have been pleased that despite being stripped of protection the small force of bombers lost only a quarter of its strength while surrounded by 100 fighters. Still, the operation had been a victory. Fighter Command lost 13 fighters, eight were claimed by JG 52.|$|E

25|$|The 1968 {{discovery}} of oil at Prudhoe Bay and the 1977 {{completion of the}} Trans-Alaska Pipeline led to an oil boom. In 1989, the Exxon Valdez hit a reef in Prince William Sound, spilling between 11 and 34 million US gallons (42,000 and 130,000 m³) of crude <b>oil</b> <b>over</b> 1,100miles (1,600km) of coastline.

25|$|Anointing is {{the ritual}} act of pouring {{aromatic}} <b>oil</b> <b>over</b> a person's head or entire body. By extension, {{the term is}} also applied to related acts of sprinkling, dousing, or smearing a person or object with any perfumed oil, milk, butter, or other fat. Scented oils are used as perfumes and sharing them {{is an act of}} hospitality. Their use to introduce a divine influence or presence is recorded from the earliest times; anointing was thus used as a form of medicine, thought to rid persons and things of dangerous spirits and demons which were believed to cause disease.|$|E
25|$|Within {{months of}} {{becoming}} premier, Bjelke-Petersen encountered his first controversy over allegations of conflict of interest. In April 1959, while still a backbencher, {{he had paid}} £2 for an Authority to Prospect, giving him the right to search for <b>oil</b> <b>over</b> 150,000km2 near Hughenden in far north Queensland. The next month he incorporated a company, Artesian Basin Oil Co. Pty Ltd, {{of which he was}} sole director and shareholder, and the same day entered an agreement to sell 51% of the company's shares to an American company for £12,650. The following day he sought the consent of Mines Minister Ernie Evans to transfer the oil search authority to Artesian for £2; the consent was given a week later.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{the midwife}} {{received}} the infant, {{placed it in}} pieces of cloth, cut the umbilical cord, and cleansed the baby. The child was sprinkled with “fine and powdery salt, or natron or aphronitre” to soak up the birth residue, rinsed, and then powdered and rinsed again. Next, the midwives cleared away any and all mucus present from the nose, mouth, ears, or anus. Midwives were encouraged by Soranus to put olive oil in the baby’s eyes to cleanse away any birth residue, and to place a piece of wool soaked in olive <b>oil</b> <b>over</b> the umbilical cord. After the delivery, the midwife made the initial call {{on whether or not}} an infant was healthy and fit to rear. She inspected the newborn for congenital deformities and testing its cry to hear {{whether or not it was}} robust and hearty. Ultimately, midwives made a determination about the chances for an infant’s survival and likely recommended that a newborn with any severe deformities be exposed.|$|E
25|$|Century eggs can {{be eaten}} without further preparation, {{on their own}} or as a side dish. As an hors d'œuvre, the Cantonese wrap chunks of this egg with slices of pickled ginger root (sometimes sold on a stick as street food). A Shanghainese recipe mixes chopped century eggs with chilled tofu. In Taiwan, it is popular to eat century eggs by slicing them, and placed on top of cold tofu with katsuobushi, soy sauce, and sesame oil in a style similar to Japanese hiyayakko. A {{variation}} of this recipe common in northern China is to slice century eggs over chilled silken (soft) tofu, adding liberal quantities of shredded young ginger and chopped spring onions as a topping, and then drizzling light soy sauce and sesame <b>oil</b> <b>over</b> the dish, to taste. They are also used in a dish called old-and-fresh eggs, where chopped century eggs are combined with (or used to top) an omelet made with fresh eggs. The century eggs may also be cut into chunks and stir fried with vegetables, which is most commonly found in Taiwanese cuisine.|$|E
25|$|In October 1911, Churchill was {{appointed}} First Lord of the Admiralty and {{continued in the}} post into the First World War. While serving in this position, he put strong emphasis on modernisation and was also in favour of using aeroplanes in combat. He undertook flying lessons himself. He launched a programme to replace coal power with oil power. When he assumed his position, oil was already being used on submarines and destroyers, but most ships were still coal-powered, though oil was sprayed on the coals to boost maximum speed. Churchill began this programme by ordering that the upcoming s were to be built with oil-fired engines. He established a Royal Commission chaired by Admiral Sir John Fisher, which confirmed the benefits of <b>oil</b> <b>over</b> coal in three classified reports, and judged that ample supplies of oil existed, but recommended that oil reserves be maintained {{in the event of}} war. The delegation then travelled to the Persian Gulf, and the government, largely through Churchill's advice, eventually invested in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, bought most of its stock, and negotiated a secret contract for a 20-year supply.|$|E

500|$|Since {{the vessel}} {{was no longer}} {{seaworthy}} and could not move under its own power, even if freed from the beach, {{the focus of the}} operation changed. Oil from the ship's fuel tanks continued to pose an environmental hazard, a situation exacerbated by both the ship's structural failure and continuing pounding from the surf. In order to mitigate the situation, the Unified Command decided to set the fuel tanks on fire in order to burn off the oil. The first attempt was made on February 10. Napalm and other incendiary devices were used to ignite the fuel, but only one of the diesel tanks was burned effectively. A second attempt was made on February 11 when US Navy explosive experts placed 39 shaped charges to breach the top of the fuel tanks from within the cargo holds. 2,280liters of napalm and nearly 180kg of plastic explosives were also used to ignite the fuel on board. The ship burned for approximately 33hours. Additional smaller-scale attempts were made to burn more <b>oil</b> <b>over</b> the next two days, with limited success. The total amount of oil that was burned is estimated to be between [...] The structural stress caused by the fire, combined with continued severe weather, caused the vessel to break into two sections around midnight on February 11.|$|E
