5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V <b>one</b> <b>got</b> two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, <b>one</b> <b>got</b> even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this <b>one</b> <b>got</b> a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

For that <b>one</b> <b>got</b> a bed closed off from the aisle by curtains; a {{compartment}} to oneself would cost more.

If {{the young}} people hadn't been at a crowded public dance overseen by extensive security (19 guards were at CHAC on Saturday night) where no <b>one</b> <b>got</b> hurt, the kids would likely have been out at unchaperoned and completely unregulated house parties—not after the dance, but all night. And, without a fat calendar of all-ages events, that's {{where they would be}} every weekend. Because without organized all-ages dances and live-music events, house parties and parking lots are all kids have.|$|E

In 1995 DAIM, Hesh and New Yorker Graffiti-Artist Per <b>One</b> <b>got</b> caught while spraying on a wall of the basketball court of elementary school 107 in the Bronx. The artists had to face charges for property damage, trespassing and possession of graffiti material. The possible sentence could vary from community service to one year in jail, reported the spokesperson of the prosecution, Charisse Campbell. They got released after the hearing though, because the authorization of the art teacher was requested {{in the run-up to}} spraying.|$|E

25|$|Childhood amnesia (also {{known as}} {{infantile}} amnesia) {{is the common}} inability to remember events from one's own childhood. Sigmund Freud notoriously attributed this to sexual repression, while modern scientific approaches generally attribute it to aspects of brain development or developmental psychology, including language development, which may be why people do not easily remember pre-language events. Researchers have found that implicit memories cannot be recalled or described. Remembering {{how to play the}} piano is a common example of implicit memory, as is walking, speaking and other everyday activities that would be difficult to focus on if they had to be relearned every time <b>one</b> <b>got</b> up in the morning. Explicit memories, on the other hand, can be recalled and described in words. Remembering the first time meeting a teacher is an example of explicit memories.|$|E
25|$|The pros {{were given}} a points system just like the amateurs. A first in the Main will earn a AA pro 240 points second 200, 160 for third and so on until six place would be worth 40 points. As in the amateur {{divisions}} the pros would earn rider points. The top ten pros would be determined by this points ranking. Additionally the best ten finishes at the nationals plus the Grand Nationals (making it eleven races) would count toward the pros eligibility to contend for the Pro #1 plate. Purse money would be distributed not only among the racers who made the main, but also those who got to the semis or even didn't make it that far, so practically every <b>one</b> <b>got</b> something for racing, {{even if it was}} just a one hundred percent payback on their entrance fee.|$|E
25|$|The {{destruction}} {{of three of}} the four trawlers and the turning back of the fourth demonstrated that Operation Market Time was an effective net for the interception of supplies destined for resupply of the Viet Cong. Except for the 1 March trawlers and one other instance in the days after Tet 1968 no other trawlers were spotted between July 1967 and August 1969. The North Vietnamese were forced to use the Ho Chi Minh trail through Laos or the neutral port of Sihanoukville in Cambodia to ship supplies to the Viet Cong. With the closing of the port at Sihanoukville to Communist shipping in August 1969, attempted North Vietnamese trawler traffic into South Vietnam resumed. Of 15 trawlers detected by Market Time assets from August 1969 to late 1970, one was sunk, 13 were turned back and only <b>one</b> <b>got</b> through. In 1970, ten out of eleven trawlers were either sunk or were turned back.|$|E

The unlucky <b>ones</b> <b>got</b> liberated by the Soviets, who instead of turning them over quickly to the western allies, held them as virtual hostages for several more months.

Local {{letters to the editor}} supported Binky during both incidents, most often arguing that polar bears' dangerousness should be respected. [...] The Zoo's director, Sammye Seawell, criticized Warburton's actions in the Anchorage Daily News, saying [...] "he violated the rules and jeopardized the bear's life." [...] Though Seawell initially insisted that the attack would not change how the zoo was run, security around Binky's cage was upgraded to keep zoo visitors out.|$|E
500|$|As to his {{national}}ism, {{he wished}} to see Scotland {{on an equal footing}} with other nations. His national pride was intense; in a Preparatory Note to The Voyage of the Scotia he wrote: [...] "While 'Science' was the talisman of the Expedition, 'Scotland' was emblazoned on its flag". This insistence on emphasising the Scottish character of his enterprises could be irksome to those who did not share his passion. However, he retained the respect and devotion of those whom he led, and of those who had known him longest. John Arthur Thomson, who had known Bruce since Granton, wrote of him when reviewing Rudmose Brown's 1923 biography: [...] "We never heard him once grumble about himself, though he was neither to hold or bend when he thought some injustice was being done to, or slight cast on, his men, on his colleagues, on his laboratory, on his Scotland. Then <b>one</b> <b>got</b> glimpses of the volcano which his gentle spirit usually kept sleeping".|$|E
500|$|After <b>one</b> <b>got</b> {{past the}} {{symbolism}} of the ladies as lakes, complaints existed about the lack of recognition of the contemporary form of female representation in art and literature which had gone from the Lillian Russell-type to the Gibson Girl to the Lillie Langtry image while Taft had apparently chosen [...] "packing house ladies" [...] as his female form. [...] When Taft presented live depictions of his sculptures with quintets of women, he faced complaints that three of his five sculptural compositions had nude upper torsos, while his live representations were fully clothed. [...] The degree to which nudity in public art was more for the [...] "sake of nudity than for the sake of art." [...] was a contemporary issue involving confiscated Paul Chabas fully nude painting, the Roman Catholic Church, critics, art dealers and collectors. [...] All this led to a 1913 amendment to the Chicago municipal obscenity laws proposed by Mayor of Chicago Carter Harrison, Jr. to the Chicago City Council, which passed three months before the dedication of Taft's partially nude fountain. Chicago Tribune writers stood behind Taft's fountain using humor against what they described as a [...] "streak of over-accentuated puritanism" [...] that could adversely affect public art.|$|E
