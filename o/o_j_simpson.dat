After Lois expresses her hope for the restaurant to be successful, Stewie sarcastically states {{that it will be}} just as successful as Liza Minnelli's Playboy photoshoot. Returning home from the restaurant, Peter and Lois decide to watch an episode of Maude, but the length of the opening theme song causes Peter to become fatigued by the show. Once the restaurant begins hemorrhaging money, Peter decides to shoot a commercial parodying M. Night Shyamalan's 1999 film The Sixth Sense. After Joe's handicapped friends take over the restaurant, Peter expresses his discomfort about the restaurant's coolness to Lois by retrieving a picture of American actor Mark Harmon and showing it to Lois in an attempt to make her understand his concern.|$|E

5|$|For {{the role}} of Kyle Reese, Orion wanted a star whose {{popularity}} was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal. Orion co-founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for The Terminator. Cameron was dubious about casting Schwarzenegger as Reese as he felt he would need someone even bigger to play the Terminator. Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson were offered the Terminator role, but both turned it down. The studio suggested <b>O.</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> for the role, but Cameron {{did not feel that}} Simpson would be believable as a killer.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} originally asked Anthony Hopkins and Clint Eastwood {{to provide}} {{the voice of the}} dentist, Dr. Wolfe, but they both turned the role down. Anthony Perkins was later asked to fulfill the role and he agreed, but died before the role could be recorded. In the end, the role went to Simpsons regular Hank Azaria. As well, the original panelist on Smartline was supposed to be <b>O.</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Simpson,</b> but he turned it down, much to the relief of the writers when Simpson was later tried for murder.|$|E
5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the <b>O.</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E

5|$|Players {{are often}} awarded after record-breaking or near-record-breaking {{offensive}} seasons. Running back <b>O.</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> won {{the award for}} 1973 after rushing for a record 2,003 yards, becoming the first NFL player to rush for 2,000 yards in a season. When his record was broken by Eric Dickerson in 1984, Dickerson placed second in voting behind quarterback Dan Marino, who that year {{was the first to}} pass for 5,000 yards in a season. Marino's 5,084 yards stood as the record for 27 years before being broken by Drew Brees in 2011, who won that season's award. In turn, 2013 winner Peyton Manning set league single-season records for passing yards (5,477) and passing touchdowns (55).|$|E
5|$|Sayers' {{record of}} 22 {{touchdowns in a}} season was broken by <b>O.</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> in 1975, who scored 23; his 22 touchdowns remains a rookie record as of 2017. Sayers remains the most recent player to score at least six touchdowns in a game. His career kickoff return average of 30.56 yards is an NFL record for players with at least 75 attempts, and {{he is one of}} several players to have scored two return touchdowns in a game. He is tied with four other players for the second most career kickoff return touchdowns, with six. Sayers' rookie record of 2,272 {{all-purpose}} yards was broken in 1988 by Tim Brown, who gained 2,317 yards through 16 games, two more games than Sayers set the record in. His single-season all-purpose yards record of 2,440 set in 1966 was broken in 1974 by Mack Herron, who surpassed it by four yards.|$|E
5|$|Owner Hugh Culverhouse, {{encouraged}} by recommendations from Vice President of Operations Ron Wolf and Alabama coaching legend Bear Bryant, chose John McKay, winner of four national championships with the USC Trojans, {{as the first}} Buccaneer head coach. Aided by a string of great tailbacks, including Heisman Trophy winners <b>O.</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> and Mike Garrett, McKay was credited with popularizing the I formation. Other candidates considered included Hank Stram, Ara Parseghian, and Joe Paterno. McKay was reportedly offered a five-year contract worth $750,000, plus cars, insurance, and real estate, and turned down an offer from the Seattle Seahawks and a counter-offer from USC to take the job. Critical of the NFL, he had turned down offers from professional teams in the past. McKay cited NCAA cutbacks in finances and recruiting as motivations for leaving the college ranks, saying simply that it was “time to try something else”. McKay’s only promise {{was that he would}} beat what he called “Pittsburgh’s timetable”, referencing the fact that it took the Steelers 41 years to win their first championship. Coach McKay would prove to be somewhat correct as Tampa Bay won the NFC's Central Division in 1979, the team's fourth year of existence, though it would take the team 27 seasons to win its first championship, which occurred in the 2002 season.|$|E

5|$|Payton {{was eager}} to improve his performance. During the 1976 NFL season, Payton rushed for 1,390 yards and scored 13 touchdowns. After the season, he was {{selected}} {{to play in the}} 1977 Pro Bowl, where he was declared the Pro Bowl MVP. The next year, he rushed for 1,852 yards and scored 16 touchdowns, becoming the league’s leading scorer for the season. He earned numerous awards that season, including the Associated Press and Pro Football Writers of America's Most Valuable Player awards. A memorable game of the 1977 NFL season was against the Minnesota Vikings on November 20. He rushed for a then-record 275 yards, breaking the previous record of 273 yards held by <b>O.</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Simpson.</b> In that record-setting game against the Vikings, Payton was suffering with a 101-degree fever and intense flu. His longest run was for 58 yards, and he caught one pass for 6 yards. His record stood for 23 years until Corey Dillon of the Cincinnati Bengals ran for 278 yards on October 22, 2000. (Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings set the current record of 296 rushing yards in 2007.) By the end of the decade, Payton had received additional accolades for his exploits as a blocker, receiver, emergency punter, and quarterback.|$|E
5|$|Greene won {{his second}} AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award after the 1974 season, {{becoming}} {{the first player to}} receive the award multiple times. That year, he developed a new tactic of lining up at a sharp angle between the guard and center to disrupt the opposition's blocking assignments. His coaches were at first skeptical of the tactic and did not allow him to try it during the regular season. He first implemented it against the Buffalo Bills in the division championship game. It proved to be highly effective, as it impeded Buffalo's blocking, and running back <b>O.</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> managed only 48 yards rushing. The following week, the Steelers faced the Oakland Raiders in the AFC championship game, with the defining match-up being Greene against All-Pro center Jim Otto. At one point Greene, consumed by emotions, kicked Otto in the groin. Later, on a third-down play, Greene threw Otto to the ground with one arm before leaping to sack quarterback Ken Stabler. Oakland was held to 29 rushing yards in the Steelers' 24–13 victory. On January 12, 1975, the Steelers won their first of four Super Bowl championships in a six-year span by defeating the Minnesota Vikings 16–6 in Super Bowl IX. In that game, lined up against center Mick Tingelhoff, Greene recorded an interception, forced fumble, and fumble recovery in what {{is considered one of the}} greatest individual defensive Super Bowl performances. Pittsburgh limited the Vikings to only 119 total yards of offense, 17 of which were gained on the ground. After the season, Greene was honored by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at its 39th Dapper Dan dinner as Pittsburgh's outstanding sports figure of the year.|$|E
25|$|The {{more severe}} {{penalties}} available in criminal law {{also means that}} it requires a higher burden of proof to be discharged than the related tort. For example, in the <b>O.</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> murder trial, the jury was not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that <b>O.</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> had committed the crime of murder; but in a later civil trial, the jury in that case decided that there was sufficient evidence to meet the standard of preponderance of the evidence required to prove the tort of wrongful death.|$|E
