Michael proves to be completely incapable of living out in the wild by himself. Dwight is forced to come out of hiding to save Michael when he tries to eat wild mushrooms.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the muscle}} in an alligator's jaw evolved to bite and grip prey. The muscles that close the jaws are {{exceptionally}} powerful, but the muscles for opening their jaws are comparatively weak.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the effectiveness <b>of</b> using <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> in sealing residential air distribution systems through two laboratory longevity tests. The first test involved {{the aging of}} common ?core-to-collar joints? <b>of</b> flexible <b>duct</b> to sheet metal collars, and sheet metal ?collar-to-plenum joints? exposed to continuous 200 ?F (93 ?C) circulating air. The second test consisted <b>of</b> baking <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> specimens in a constant 212 ?F (100 ?C) oven following the UL 181 BFX ?Temperature Test? requirements. The study concluded that the <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> performance in sealing joints depends on the joint's space dimensions; it gets worse {{as the number of}} dimensions required to describe the joint increases (1 -D to 3 -D). This is essentially caused by the shrinkage <b>of</b> the <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> backing that results in the peeling of its rubber-based adhesive off the sheet metal fixture. The baking test results showed that the failure in the <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> joints could be attributed to the combination type <b>of</b> the <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> and the material it is applied to...|$|R

2500|$|FBI latent-print {{examiner}} Elizabeth Fontaine {{testified that}} adhesive {{in the shape}} of a heart was found on a corner of a piece <b>of</b> <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> that was covering the mouth portion of Caylee's remains during ultraviolet testing. Fontaine examined three pieces <b>of</b> <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> found on Caylee's remains for fingerprints, and said she did not find fingerprints but did not expect to, given the months the tape and the remains had been outdoors and exposed to the elements, stressing that any oil or sweat from a person's fingertips would have long since deteriorated. Though Fontaine showed the findings to her supervisor, she did not initially try to photograph the heart-shaped adhesive, explaining, [...] "When I observe something is unexpected, I note it and continue with my examination."

2500|$|University of Florida {{professor}} and human identification laboratory director Michael Warren was {{brought on by}} the prosecution to present a computer animation of the way duct tape could have been used in the death of the child, which the defense objected to hearing. Judge Perry, after a short recess to review, ruled that the video could be shown to the jury. The animation featured a picture of Caylee Anthony taken alongside Casey Anthony, superimposed with an image of Caylee's decomposed skull, and another with a strip <b>of</b> <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> that was recovered with her remains. The images were slowly brought together showing that the duct tape could have covered her nose and mouth. Baez stated, [...] "This disgusting superimposition {{is nothing more than a}} fantasy ...They're throwing things against the wall and seeing if it sticks."

The magazine rejected Apple's explanation after conducting tests in a controlled environment, and comparing the results against prior generations of iPhone. It sarcastically pointed out that using a piece of tape to cover the lower left antenna gap was one way to fix the problem, but recommended that consumers who [...] "want an iPhone that works well without a masking-tape fix" [...] purchase the iPhone 3GS instead.

40|$|AbstractThe {{relevance}} {{of this article}} is explained by the increasingly extensive efforts associated with construction and reconstruction of buildings and structures having mainly architectural and cultural significance, as well as preserving their pristine ambience and integrity for use by future generations. Furthermore, reconstruction helps to serve a range of social demands, such as the provision of comfortable and safe living conditions for people. The review of research publications shows that wooden structures are the first to lose their load-bearing capacity during the long-term use of buildings and structures. Still, the scientific literature mostly features the traditional labor-intensive methods of timberwork strengthening that further increase its weight, or the methods of external reinforcing with composite tapes. This article, for the first time, discusses the technology of the strengthening timber framing with butterfly-shaped wooden inserts. Joints between existing rafters and wooden inserts are reinforced with two layers <b>of</b> the furniture <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> and fine composite mesh pressed in between, with the plywood top finishing <b>of</b> the <b>duct</b> <b>tape.</b> The experimental studies that were in progress for two years showed that the technology suggested meeting all the reliability requirements applicable for timber trusses. As compared to traditional technologies, the suggested solution is less labor-intensive and more sparing in terms of the truss weight, as it only adds the weight <b>of</b> furniture <b>duct</b> <b>tape,</b> composite mesh and plywood at the joints. This is the applied research, and its outcome can be used not only for strengthening of roof timber, but also for reinforcing of wooden inter-floor joists...|$|R

40|$|The aging tests {{conducted}} so far {{showed that}} <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> tends to degrade in its {{performance as the}} joint it is applied to requires a geometrical description of a higher number of space dimensions (1 -D, 2 -D, 3 -D). One-dimensional joints are the easiest to seal with <b>duct</b> <b>tape,</b> and thus the least to experience failure. Two-dimensional joints, such as the flexible duct core-to-collar joints tested in this study, {{are less likely to}} fail than three-dimensional collar-to-plenum joints, as the shrinkage could have a positive effect in tightening the joint. Three-dimensional joints are the toughest to seal and the most likely to experience failure. The 2 -D flexible duct core-to-collar joints passed the six-month period of the aging test in terms of leakage, but {{with the exception of the}} foil-butyl tape, showed degradation in terms hardening, brittleness, partial peeling, shrinkage, wrinkling, delamination of the tape layers, flaking, cracking, bubbling, oozing and discoloration. The baking test results showed that the failure in the <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> joints could be attributed to the type of combination <b>of</b> the <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> and the material it is applied to, as the <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> behaves differently with different substrates. Overall, the foil-butyl tape (Tape 4) had the best results, while the film tape (Tape 3) showed the most deterioration. The conventional <b>duct</b> <b>tapes</b> tested (Tape 1 and Tape 2) were between these two extremes, with Tape 2 performing better than Tape 1. Lastly, we found that plastic straps became discolored and brittle during the tests, and a couple of straps broke completely. Therefore, we recommend that clamping the duct-taped flexible core-to-collar joints should be done with metallic adjustable straps...|$|R

Broomball sticks vary quite widely in length and shape according to the user's preference (and to some degree his ability in shaping and taping the straw).
