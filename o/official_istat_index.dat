40|$|The article {{contains}} a broad description of the tourist trend in the Emilia-Romagna region during the years 2001 - 2003. <b>Official</b> <b>Istat</b> data are used to place the regional tourism in the national outline, while data from provincial and regional administration are handled to find the specific characteristics of the phenomenon in the region. The analysis is based on structural indicators (hotels and complementary structures capacity) and flux indicators (arrivals, presences and mean time of stay) with particular reference to guest’s nationality. National and international tourist fluxes are analysed considering the kind of structure used, the kind of tourist resort, destinations and seasonality...|$|R
2500|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, {{because of}} severe poverty and high unemployment, the village {{suffered}} a considerable emigration towards richer Northern Italy areas, especially {{in the town of}} Bologna, where a sizeable community live nowadays. A small number also migrated to Belgium, in the Charleroi area to work in the local coal mines, and France by subsequently settling there. From around 900 units in 1951, the population halved to 457 in 1982, and down to 371 in 1991, according to <b>official</b> <b>ISTAT</b> statistics. [...] In 2001 the total population plummeted to 271 units and as of 2006, the stable residents are less than 250, of which those aged 65+ account for half of the total.|$|R
40|$|Crop monitoring, and in {{particular}} yield estimate and forecast is considered very important for those Boards in charge to monitor agrarian season. Remote Sensing for its features and potentiality can contribute to these tasks in some new and interesting ways. This study is aimed to investigate the potential use of AVHRR/NDVI data from NOAA satellites for crop monitoring in South Italy within an interregional agrometeorological project. Over 1600 images in LAC format are processed from 1986 to date. Using previous results on NDVI correlation with plant photosynthetic capacity and efficiency during wheat Grain Filling Period Duration (GFPD) a simple linear regression model has been derived for wheat yield estimate and forecast for each South Italy Agricultural Region. Estimated and forecasted values are compared with <b>official</b> <b>ISTAT</b> data. Pages: 458 - 46...|$|R
40|$|Since 1991 social cooperatives {{have been}} {{conceived}} by the Italian legislation as mutual-benefit entrepreneurial organizations {{with a social}} character. The social objective was nested into the mutualistic structure, while the multi-stakeholder governance and the accumulation of socialized assets made social cooperative similar to more traditional non-profit forms. In 2010, the <b>official</b> <b>ISTAT</b> census of social cooperatives recorded about 10. 000 active organizations at the national level. The paper offers {{an analysis of the}} structure and development of governance at CEFF, {{as an example of the}} emergence of a multi-stakeholder cooperative. By analyzing its evolution over time, we aim at shedding new light on the social nature of cooperation, on the ways in which cooperatives can generate and distribute social value across an integrated (horizontal) value chain by means of networking...|$|R
40|$|Setting fees in {{transport}} service {{has always been}} particularly important in economy both under a theoretical {{point of view and}} for the aims economic policies have to achieve by means of this instrument. In this view, the issue of the European Commission Green Book in 1997 - on ports and sea infrastructures - and that of the White Book in 1998 - referring to a fair set of fees to exploit infrastructures with an approach in stages in an UE context - led again to the debate on criteria to set transport infrastructures fees, particularly for ports. This paper aims to find a motion to review taxation on shipped and unloaded goods (art. 13, paragraph 1, letter c), act of 28 th January 1994, no. 84) effective in the Brindisi port, Apulia, determined with ordinance no. 1 / 1999. Tax revision will occur referring to last years <b>ISTAT</b> <b>indexes</b> and considering the possibility of a higher levy to Harbour Authority necessary to improve services for passengers and goods movement. Variables of port fees will be set both for passengers and goods handling. Moreover, estimating transport demand elasticity in relation to price (fee) is essential to set fees variation. To set fees other ports taxes – comparable and/or competitor with the Brindisi port - will be taken into account together with the increase in management operational costs expected in 2004. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{socioeconomic}} {{importance of}} the dairy-sheep supply chain is noteworthy especially at the farming stage. In fact, {{according to the latest}} <b>official</b> statistics (<b>ISTAT</b> 2012), Sardinia farms breed approximately three million sheep (44 % of the total Italian sheep livestock) and provide 56 % of the total sheep milk produced in Italy. However, among the 12, 000 sheep breeding farms, only 5000 are specialized (ISTAT 2012), and despite the increasing average herd size (about 240 heads per farm), the majority of businesses are still family run and predominantly (or exclusively) make direct use of the labor available within their family (Pulina et al. 2011). Unlike in the past, {{only a small portion of}} milk is now processed into cheese on farms, with the rest being supplied to processing firms (Furesi et al. 2013; Idda et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} digital skills, and its {{aim is to}} empirically assess the Matthew effect in Italy. Thus, {{following}} an empirical point of view, microdata from Italian <b>official</b> statistical sources (<b>Istat,</b> Istituto Nazionale di Statistica) and harmonised European indicators have been used. The chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 overviews the various measurement approaches suggested in the literature. Section 3 presents the European framework that is the operating procedures – and the recent changes – proposed by the European Commission to detect and measure eSkills. Using Istat microdata, Sections 4 and 5 focus on the Italian context, to identify the synthetic indices of e-skills and an Internet user’s typology based on digital competence and socio-demographic characteristics. Finally, in Section 6 the main results are summarized and new lines of research are proposed. This chapter highlights the relation between e-inclusion and e-skills, starting with the complexity of these concepts, which are often applied with different semantic dimensions and different modalities of measurement. The different approaches to establishing indicators of e-skills inevitably introduce elements of diversification. To obviate this problem, setting up shared indicators, used in periodical extensive surveys, {{makes it possible to}} compare the results in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Thus, it seems appropriate to use indicators harmonised in the European Union. The results of this study, which was based on using data collected by the Italian <b>official</b> statistical sources (<b>Istat),</b> reveals the convergence of skills pertaining to computer use with those linked to the Internet use. A diversification of skills in terms of complexity and the different types of ability is clear, depending on a prevalently instrumental or prevalently relational use of the technology. Digital inequalities are thus reiterated, also within a segment of the population that represents the youngest, better qualified subgroup, better positioned in terms of the labour market and which can consider itself “included”, {{on the basis of the}} simple criterion of net access. Even within the connected group, the dynamics of the Matthew effect can be seen: those with the "richest" personal resources activate a cumulative multiplication of advantages that follows the logic of “those who have, will be given more”. Instead the “poorest” are victims of a cumulative multiplication of disadvantages according to the logic of “those who have nothing, will have even that taken away”. Thus, there are categories of subjects who are “richer” and “poorer” in e-skills, who again present the customary inequalities of gender (men/women), generations (young/old), and culture (low/high education). These elements reiterate the old, but not negligible, inequalities, heightened by the new technologies: "the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer"...|$|R
30|$|Before {{commenting on}} the {{differences}} between Federici’s findings and our results, we offer a brief introduction to the data sources used. All the analyses presented in {{this section of the}} paper are based on the “Rilevazione annuale dei matrimoni da fonti di stato civile” for the period 2007 – 2009. This data source accounts for all the marriages legally recognized by the Italian Republic. In particular, every minister (both civil and religious) who has celebrated a civilly valid marriage in Italy, must fill out a form with detailed information about both the marriage (date, place, patrimonial regime chosen by the spouses and type of rite) and the spouses (date of birth, place of birth and of residence, nationality, occupation and level of education). These forms are then collected by the Italian <b>Official</b> Statistics Institute (<b>ISTAT).</b> In the case of marriages celebrated with the religious rite, we are speaking of the so-called matrimonio concordatario, i.e. a religious marriage recognized by the state, thanks to an official agreement between the representatives of a religious group and the Italian State. These religious groups are the Roman Catholic Church; the Italian Union of Adventist Churches; the Italian Union of Jewish Communities; the Italian Union of the Evangelical Lutheran Churches; the Italian Union of the Baptist Churches; the Waldesian Church; and the Italian Pentecostal Evangelical Church. Even if not all religious marriages are celebrated with this formula, at least for Catholic marriages, {{in the vast majority of}} cases (more than 80  % of all Catholic marriages), the marriage is a “matrimonio concordatario” (see Bonarini 2013 for more detailed data and for a discussion). The procedure to get access to these data is particularly long and complex because of the severe privacy norms protecting them. The following steps need to be undertaken to access material: (1) the interested researcher has to present a research project asking for access to the data; (2) the project is evaluated by the General Direction of ISTAT; (3) if authorization is granted, the researcher does not enter into possession of the data but he or she has to elaborate them in the relevant data laboratory in a regional ISTAT office; (4) all the outputs produced have to be submitted again to the General Direction, for a last check to guarantee the non-infringement of privacy rules. These steps are the principle reason that we have focused on such a short time period, exactly 50  years after Federici’s analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical work in this area using ISTAT data (save, of course, that conducted by Federici herself).|$|R
40|$|Tourism, {{more than}} other fields, needs to be managed. As such, the {{provision}} of reliable information and adequate tools {{is one of the}} major challenges to monitor and to manage tourism destinations. Sicily (Italy) seems to have a great potential coming from its tourism resources, and most of the recent development programs have been focused on tourism. In line with the world’s trend, tourism in Sicily faced a growth in terms of overnight stays, from about 9 millions in 1994, to more than 14 millions in 2007. The regional expenditure in tourism from 1996 to 2006 was of euro 785 millions (Federalberghi, 2007), which ranks Sicily as the second region in Italy for tourism expenditure, in the years considered. Finally, in the South of Italy the share of employees in HORECA (hotel, restaurant, and camping) sector in 2006 was of 4. 7 %, though the overall impact is likely to be higher if the others tourism related activities would be considered. However, there are still many open questions, which treats the possibility of a sustainable development of tourism in Sicily. Some of these questions are related to the spatial concentration of tourism activities – mainly coastal destination; to the high share of national tourism demand, characterized by a lower expenditure profile; to the decreasing efficiency of accommodation establishments in the lasts years. Particularly, the low monthly average occupancy rates of accommodation establishments are one of the major problems of tourism in Sicily, since they are affected by an high degree of seasonality. In tourism literature, seasonality in tourism demand has been studied under different perspectives, such as causes, impacts and policy implications. However, relatively few authors have closely examined ways of quantifying and comparing empirical patterns (Koenig & Bischoff, 2005). This work starts with a critical analysis of the concept of seasonality itself and with its specification from the statistical point of view. After reviewing main seasonality measures, highlighting their properties in relation to the different research aims, this paper analyzes a standard and comparable efficiency measure, such as the occupancy rate of Sicilian accommodation establishments (by nationality of guests and by accommodation category), placing particular attention to its seasonality caused by tourism demand. Seasonal adjustment procedures, such as TRAMO-SEATS, are used to derive seasonal factors. Through the use of seasonal factors several seasonality measures are compared, distinguishing between measures for amplitude and measures for pattern. Data come from the Italian <b>official</b> statistical institute (<b>ISTAT)</b> surveys on tourism. Some considerations on data quality are also included in this work, and these are related particularly to the un-observed tourism, and to the geographical level of aggregation of data. Finally, this paper aims to highlight some questions related to the efficiency evaluation of tourism sector in Sicily, and to provide some tools for the analysis of seasonality which can be used to compare efficiency level of tourism activity and to evaluate the efficacy of policies oriented to reduce seasonality...|$|R
