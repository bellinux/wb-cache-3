5|$|A {{terracotta}} Nandi (the bull {{of the god}} Shiva – {{father of}} Murugan), head of a woman, terracotta lamps, potsherds and a shivalinga (aniconic symbol of Shiva) made of green stone {{are some of the}} important artefacts found at the site. The Nandi is the first <b>one</b> <b>made</b> of terracotta to be found. While most of the items unearthed belong to the Sangam period, artefacts of a later period including a Chola copper coin have also been found.|$|E

50|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} {{to secure a}} vow to the Temple, they seized {{property}} from the <b>one</b> who <b>made</b> the vow. But they let the <b>one</b> who <b>made</b> the vow keep food for 30 days, garments for 12 months, bed and bedding, shoes, and tefillin. If the <b>one</b> who <b>made</b> the vow was a craftsperson, they left two of every kind of tool. If the <b>one</b> who <b>made</b> the vow was a carpenter, they left two axes and two saws. Rabbi Eliezer {{said that if the}} <b>one</b> who <b>made</b> the vow was a farmer, they left a yoke of oxen. If the <b>one</b> who <b>made</b> the vow was a donkey-driver, they left a donkey.|$|R
5|$|Adolf Hitler's {{sexuality}} {{has long}} been a matter of historical and scholarly debate. There is evidence that he had romantic encounters with a number of women during his lifetime, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence of homosexual encounters. His name has been linked to a number of possible female lovers, two of whom committed suicide. Another died of complications eight years after a suicide attempt, and <b>one</b> <b>made</b> a failed suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|Deodato drew {{influence}} from {{the works of}} Paolo Cavara, Gualtiero Jacopetti, and Franco Prosperi, documentary filmmakers of whom Deodato was a fan. Prosperi and Jacopetti produced several Mondo films, which are documentaries similar to the <b>one</b> <b>made</b> in Cannibal Holocaust. These documentaries focused on sensationalistic and graphic content from around the world, including bizarre local customs, death, and general cruelty. Deodato followed suit in ways of similar content, such as graphic violence and animal slayings. Although fictional, Deodato created a similar exposé of worldly violence, such as Cavara's, Prosperi's and Jacopetti's Mondo Cane.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 Byard {{was heavily}} {{involved}} in jazz education: he began teaching at the New England Conservatory of Music {{and went on to}} work at several other music institutions, as well as having private students. He continued performing and recording, mainly in solo and small group settings, but he also led two big bands – <b>one</b> <b>made</b> up of some of his students, and the other of professional musicians. His death, from a single gunshot while in his home, remains an unsolved mystery.|$|E

5|$|Like the Shieldings’ lookout, <b>one</b> <b>made</b> {{guardian}} of the gateway to Lejre {{would have had to}} be trusted, and perhaps connected to the king by family or loyalty; the guardian would at least occupy an important position in the military hierarchy. Adornments like the Gevninge helmet fragment would have served to identify the rank of such a person, adding decoration to a helmet meant for more than just protection.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, Michigan {{defeated}} Michigan State (#9 AP/#10 Coaches) in the Ann Arbor rematch {{of their}} rivalry series as Trey Burke made 2 steals {{in the final}} 30 seconds to secure the 58–57 victory. Michigan snapped a 453-game streak with at least <b>one</b> <b>made</b> three-point shot {{and became the first}} team since February 2009 to defeat a top ten opponent without making one. On March 6, with its Big 10 Conference Championship destiny in its own hands, Michigan defeated Purdue to set up a championship showdown with Indiana on March 10. Michigan concluded its road schedule with a 5–5 record.|$|E
5|$|Organic finds {{are rarely}} well {{documented}} with hoards, because most coin and treasure finds are removed hastily by the finder or have previously been disrupted by farm work rather than excavated. The Hoxne organic finds included bone, wood and other plant material, and leather. Small fragments from a decorated ivory pyxis (a cylindrical lidded box) were found, {{along with more}} than 150 tiny shaped pieces of bone inlay or veneer, probably from a wooden box or boxes that have decayed. Minuscule fragments of wood adhering to metal objects were identified as belonging to nine species of timber, all native to Britain: wood traces associated with the iron fittings of the outer chest established that {{it was made of}} oak. Silver locks and hinges were from two small wooden boxes or caskets, <b>one</b> <b>made</b> of decorative cherry wood and <b>one</b> <b>made</b> of yew. Some wheat straw survived from padding between the plain silver bowls, which also bore faint traces of linen cloth. Leather fragments were too degraded for identification.|$|E

5|$|The Orange Tower is an 11-storey building, {{designed}} by architects Sheppard Robson. It is a glazed structure with {{four types of}} cladding, including <b>one</b> <b>made</b> of folded aluminium in a diamond pattern.

5|$|The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is {{the debut}} studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, {{and the only}} <b>one</b> <b>made</b> under {{founding}} member Syd Barrett's leadership. The album, named after the title of chapter seven of Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows and featuring a kaleidoscopic cover photo of the band taken by Vic Singh, was recorded from February to May 1967 and released on 5 August 1967. It was produced by Beatles engineer Norman Smith and released in 1967 by EMI Columbia in the United Kingdom and Tower in the United States, in August and October respectively.|$|E
5|$|The rifle, {{without the}} {{silencer}} or sights attached, {{was lying on}} her body pointing up at her neck. June's Bible {{lay on the floor}} to the right of Sheila.

5000|$|In April 2006, Nam-Hee Chae, the {{president}} of KRRI, called for a generic name for Korean-made high-speed trains, one to match recognised high-speed train brand names like Shinkansen for <b>ones</b> <b>made</b> in Japan, TGV for <b>ones</b> <b>made</b> in France, and ICE for <b>ones</b> <b>made</b> in Germany. [...] Chae argued that G7 is difficult to explain to foreigners, HSR-350x is not a proper name for series trains, and KTX is already associated with trains with technology imported from France. [...] After collecting and discussing proposals, one year later, on April 5, 2007, Chae announced the name Hanvit (Hangul: 한빛), which means a streak of intense light in Korean. [...] Under the new naming scheme, HSR-350x became Hanvit 350, KRRI's new distributed power high-speed train project HEMU-400X became Hanvit 400, and its tilting train TTX became Hanvit 200.|$|R
5|$|Two limited {{editions of}} the globe were made in Berlin in the mid 1930s, one for the Nazi Party and another for German {{dictator}} Adolf Hitler himself. The <b>one</b> <b>made</b> for the Führer was nearly {{the size of a}} Volkswagen car and manufactured at a great expense. It changed Abyssinia (today's Ethiopia) to Italian East Africa. The other was made of standard wood with no special features. The actual number of globes produced cannot be verified as the factory that produced the globe, along with its archives, was destroyed in air raids in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Al-Biruni (973–1048) {{measured}} the {{radius of the}} earth using a new method. It involved observing {{the height of a}} mountain at Nandana (now in Pakistan). Al-Idrisi (1100–1166) created a map of the world for Roger, the Norman King of Sicily. He also wrote the Book of Roger, a geographic study of the peoples, climates, resources and industries of the whole of the world known at that time. The Ottoman admiral Piri Reis (c. 1470–1553) made a map of the New World and West Africa in 1513. He made use of maps from Greece, Portugal, Muslim sources, and perhaps <b>one</b> <b>made</b> by Christopher Columbus. He was part of a major tradition of Ottoman cartography.|$|E
5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each <b>one</b> <b>made</b> of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E

5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and <b>one</b> <b>made</b> a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E
5|$|Byard also {{continued}} to play and record with other leaders. While in Europe in 1965, he joined Art Blakey's band {{for a series of}} concerts there. In 1967 Byard played in a small group with drummer Elvin Jones. Between 1966 and 1969 Byard recorded three albums with the saxophonist Eric Kloss, then, in 1970, returned to Mingus' band, including for performances in Europe. Byard occasionally substituted on piano in Duke Ellington's orchestra in 1974 when the leader was unwell. In 1974–75 Byard had a residency at Bradley’s in New York. He also fronted a big band, the Apollo Stompers, which was formed in the late 1970s. There were two versions of the band: <b>one</b> <b>made</b> up of musicians in New York, and the other using students from the New England Conservatory of Music, where Byard had taught from 1969.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1911 exhibition, at the {{personal}} request of Sir George White, Coandă {{moved to the}} United Kingdom {{to take a position}} as chief engineer or chief designer at British and Colonial Aeroplane Company for a few years. In the next four decades Coandă worked on a great variety of inventions. During World War II he revived his earlier turbo-propulseur engine when he was contracted by the German Army in late 1942 to develop an air propulsion system for military ambulance snow sledges much like the <b>one</b> <b>made</b> for the Russian Grand Duke. The German contract concluded after one year, yielding no plans for production. Though Coandă had experimented with a variety of nozzles, and said that he had achieved a degree of success, no turbojet-engine-style fuel injection or combustion in the air stream was attempted.|$|E
