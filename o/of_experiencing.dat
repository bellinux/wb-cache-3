They show that property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because it reduces their susceptibility to violence.|$|E

Another common subject in his writings was the need of putting oneself under the guidance of a spiritual father. The authority for many of his teachings derived from the traditions of the Desert Fathers, early Christian monks and ascetics. Symeon's writings include Hymns of Divine Love, Ethical Discourses, and The Catechetical Discourses.|$|E

In all his work, Carpentier uses the characters he creates {{to explore the}} notions of subjectivity and identity, analyzing {{the way in which}} individuals see themselves and others within cultural settings. In order to achieve such an analysis, Carpentier makes use of spectatorship: his characters perceive a spectacle in alterable ways which parallel their alterable ways <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> the world. Spectacle situations are also sometimes used by Carpentier as a tool for the characters to reframe and rethink the world, as well as to establish individual and group identity.|$|E
5|$|According to Twain, {{she became}} {{depressed}} and lost {{her desire to}} live after the divorce. As a distraction, she began to write a memoir, titled From This Moment On after the 1998 song of the same name. She then re-evaluated her life and noted a pattern of withholding emotions, which affected her voice for both speaking and singing. She explained {{the loss of her}} voice resulted from the cumulative stress <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> domestic violence in her childhood, the death of her parents, stress from her musical career, and the divorce. As a result, the singer developed dysphonia, an impairment in the ability to produce sound because of tightened muscles enveloping her voice box. In order to recover, Twain embarked on a documented journey with the series Why Not? with Shania Twain. Twain's wanted go outside her comfort zone and perform once again, while inspiring viewers to be proactive about their own problems.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{oriented}} to The Intensity <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> {{and its role}} in The Dramaturgy of Experiential Courses. The main concepts: The Intensity <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> and The Dynamics <b>of</b> <b>Experience,</b> are described in the theoretical part. At first, the author defines the concept of The Intensity <b>of</b> <b>Experience,</b> furthermore she describes diferences between The Intensity and Dynamics <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> in order to implement both concepts into the context of Experiential Education. The second chapter is aimed at Experiential Courses, their background and history, principles of Experiential Education and Dramaturgy of Experiential Education Courses. The main part of the thesis is the third chapter, which is devoted to quantitative-qualitative research. This research is focused on The Intensity <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> evaluated by the participants, which the author further compares with The Intensity <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> intended by instructors.

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> has two sides: {{it implies}} that {{knowledge}} is acquired through the senses, and {{it implies that}} knowledge is acquired over time. Different traditions of thought have emphasized either {{one or the other}} of these two aspects <b>of</b> <b>experience,</b> with epistemology gravitating toward an idea <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> as perception and political philosophy gravitating toward an idea <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> as repetition. In this paper, I argue that Hume's great innovation consisted in taking the notion <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> traditionally associated with political philosophy and applying it to epistemology. Meanwhile, Kant aimed his critique at the traditional epistemological notion <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> and thus failed to appreciate Hume's originality.  </p...|$|R

5|$|Carol Vernallis, author <b>of</b> <b>Experiencing</b> Music Video, found homoerotic connotations between Madonna and the mermen. The mermen in {{the video}} exist in a {{self-contained}} world of their own, where they procreate with their own kind, both biologically and socially. The fact that the mermen {{did not seem to}} possess genitalia led Vernallis to believe that the video associated them with other works by Ritts – namely homoerotic sculptural images without penises. Their tails drew different meanings, including sexual ones and Christian symbolism. Since in contemporary art, images of mermen are rare while mermaids are common, they are sometimes called fairies partly because it is not known how they came to be. Vernallis believed that the mysteriousness and the elusiveness of the mermen {{in the video}} played a crucial role. They never address the camera directly and are often shown disappearing from view. Vernallis believed that since invisibility was a central theme in the homosexual community, this actually portrayed oppression and the desire to watch but never be seen.|$|E

Some with severe anaphylaxis may suffer cardiac arrest and will need resuscitation. Inhalers may additionally be used in case a victim has asthma and experiences a reaction from a sting. The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended, as it is known to increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Medications like antihistamines, H2 blockers, corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes have no effect on anaphylaxis.|$|E

Supporters of his predecessor, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, lambasted Meade before the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, where Radical Republicans suspected that Meade was a Copperhead and tried in vain to relieve him from command. Daniel E. Sickles and Daniel Butterfield accused Meade of planning to retreat from Gettysburg during the battle. Most politicians, including Lincoln, criticized Meade for what they considered to be his half-hearted pursuit of Lee after the battle. A number of Meade's most competent subordinates—Winfield S. Hancock, John Gibbon, Gouverneur K. Warren, and Henry J. Hunt, all heroes of the battle—defended Meade in print, but Meade was embittered by the overall experience.|$|E

25|$|Optimism bias is {{typically}} measured through two determinants of risk: absolute risk, where individuals {{are asked to}} estimate their likelihood <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> a negative event compared to their actual chance <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> a negative event (comparison against self), and comparative risk, where individuals are asked to estimate the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> a negative event (their personal risk estimate) compared to others {{of the same age}} and sex (a target risk estimate). Problems can occur when trying to measure absolute risk because it is extremely difficult to determine the actual risk statistic for a person. Therefore, the optimistic bias is primarily measured in comparative risk forms, where people compare themselves against others, through direct and indirect comparisons. Direct comparisons ask whether an individual's own risk <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> an event is less than, greater than, or equal to someone else's risk, while indirect comparisons ask individuals to provide separate estimates of their own risk <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> an event and other's risk <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> the same event.|$|E
