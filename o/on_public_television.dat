25|$|Yanni {{continues}} {{to use the}} musical shorthand that he developed as a child, blending jazz, classical, soft rock, and world music to create predominantly instrumental works. Although this genre of music was not well suited for commercial pop radio and music television, Yanni received international recognition by producing concerts at historic monuments and by producing videos that were broadcast <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>television.</b> His breakthrough concert, Live at the Acropolis, yielded the second best-selling music concert video of all time. Additional historic sites for Yanni's concerts have included India's Taj Mahal, China's Forbidden City, the United Arab Emirates' Burj Khalifa, Russia's Kremlin, Puerto Rico's El Morro castle, Lebanon's ancient city of Byblos, Tunisia's Roman Theatre of Carthage, India's Laxmi Vilas Palace, the Egyptian pyramids and Great Sphinx of Giza, and the Amman Citadel.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, PBS {{produced}} a documentary entitled 'Trader' {{which focused on}} Jones's activities. The film shows Jones {{as a young man}} predicting the 1987 crash, using methods similar to market forecaster Robert Prechter. Although the video was shown <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>television</b> in November 1987, few copies exist. When copies surface, Jones attempts to buy them up. According to Michael Glyn, the video's director, Jones requested in the 1990s that the documentary be removed from circulation. The video has surfaced from time to time on different video sharing and torrent sites, but has often been taken down shortly thereafter due to copyright claims. Various theories exist as to why Jones does not support the film. Despite it showing a positive approach to risk and client care, as well as showcasing Jones's charity work, {{it has been suggested that}} it may be because of the trading secrets revealed within it.|$|E

500|$|Sesame Street {{focused on}} {{children}} from disadvantaged backgrounds, but the show's creators recognized {{that in order}} to achieve the kind of success they wanted, they needed to encourage all children, no matter what their background, to watch it.

500|$|Sesame Street was {{conceived}} in 1966 during discussions between television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and Carnegie Foundation vice president Lloyd Morrisett.

After two years of research, the newly formed Children's Television Workshop (CTW) received a combined grant of US$8 million ($ million in [...] dollars) from the Carnegie Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and the U.S. Federal Government to create and produce a new children's television show. The program premiered <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>television</b> stations on November 10, 1969.
