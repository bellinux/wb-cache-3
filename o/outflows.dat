A simple dynamical model of the <b>outflow</b> based on potential vorticity conservation is used to find the horizontal extension of the <b>outflow</b> from the coast.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} {{analysis}} of cool <b>outflowing</b> gas around galaxies, traced by Mg-II absorption lines in the coadded spectra of a sample of 486 zCOSMOS galaxies at 1 = z = 1. 5. These galaxies span a range of stellar masses (9. 45 = log(10) [M-*/M-circle dot] = 10. 7) and star formation rates (0. 14 = log(10) [SFR/M-circle dot yr(- 1) ] = 2. 35). We identify the cool <b>outflowing</b> component in the Mg (II) absorption and find that the equivalent width of the <b>outflowing</b> component increases with stellar mass. The <b>outflow</b> equivalent width also increases steadily with the increasing star formation rate of the galaxies. At similar stellar masses, the blue galaxies exhibit a significantly higher <b>outflow</b> equivalent width as compared to red galaxies. The <b>outflow</b> equivalent width shows strong correlation with the star formation surface density (Sigma(SFR)) of the sample. For the disk galaxies, the <b>outflow</b> equivalent width is higher for the face-on systems {{as compared to the}} edge-on ones, indicating that for the disk galaxies, the <b>outflowing</b> gas is primarily bipolar in geometry.

5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital <b>outflows</b> and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia was {{the country}} {{hardest hit by}} the Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997â€“98. From mid-1997 there were large capital <b>outflows</b> and against the US dollar. Due to poor bank lending practices, many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah. The weakening rupiah spurred panic buying of US dollar by these companies, causing the Indonesian Rupiah to drop in value from a pre-crisis level of Rp. 2,600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp. 17,000. Consequently, many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13.7% leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country. Efforts by the central bank to defend the rupiah proved futile and only drained the country's dollar reserves. In exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, between October 1997 and the following April, Suharto signed three letters of intent with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an economic reform process. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits, and set-up the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take over management of troubled banks {{in order to prevent}} the collapse of the financial system. Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation, the government raised interest rate up to 70% pa in February 1998 which further worsened the contraction of the economy.|$|E

40|$|Glaucoma is {{the second}} leading cause of {{irreversible}} blindness in the United States.

Unfortunately, the biology and physiology of the human <b>outflow</b> tract and its role in ocular hypertension remains poorly understood. The purpose of our study is to investigate the pharmacological regulation of aqueous <b>outflow</b> in human conventional <b>outflow</b> pathway using anterior segment perfusion model. Human anterior segments were perfusion cultured for one or two weeks while the functional response of cells in the conventional <b>outflow</b> pathway was measured by recording the pressure change in the anterior chamber and the <b>outflow</b> facility was calculated. In addition, the central corneal thickness was recorded every 24 hours during the perfusion and the relationship between functional corneal endothelial cells and viable trabecular meshwork cells were examined. After perfusion-fixation, drainage tissues of each anterior segment were histologically graded. At last, an effective anti-glaucoma agent - bimatoprost and a prostamide specific antagonist were introduced to the anterior segment perfusion model and their pharmacological function in regulating <b>outflow</b> facility in human conventional <b>outflow</b> pathway was investigated. We attained stable <b>outflow</b> facility from the perfusion culture of anterior segment and found that the <b>outflow</b> pathway tissues were viable after dissection and weeks of incubation in the perfusion system. In addition, we found that there was a recovery in central corneal thickness over time of perfusion and this recovery correlated with the viability of the trabecular meshwork tissues. Finally, we observed that bimatoprost increased <b>outflow</b> facility and a prostamide specific antagonist significantly attenuated this effect. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that the tissues of conventional <b>outflow</b> pathway are viable after weeks of perfusion and the function of corneal endothelial cells reflects the viability of the trabecular meshwork cells in conventional <b>outflow</b> pathway. Finally, our data supports that bimatoprost increases <b>outflow</b> facility by targeting a novel receptor in the conventional <b>outflow</b> pathway...|$|R
