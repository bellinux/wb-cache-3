500|$|In Tony Johnston's 2005 book, Neighbours: 20 Years of Ramsay Street, Charlene placed {{sixth in}} the twenty classic {{characters}} chapter. Johnston said Charlene and her mother represented [...] "the old and the new", that her career choice was unusual and her [...] "razor-sharp tongue" [...] put the fear into all the men who lusted after her. Johnston added that the younger female viewers admired Charlene, while the boys loved her feisty nature. In her book Soap Opera, Dorothy Hobson believed Charlene broke stereotypes, especially {{when it came to}} careers for women in the 1980s. She wrote, [...] "The sight {{of one of the most}} attractive female characters, dressed in overalls, with her cascading blonde curls tied up <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> was one of the most positive images for breaking the stereotypes of what jobs are suitable for girls." [...] Hobson also praised Charlene's on-screen relationship with Scott branding the positive images for young people as [...] "immense". The BBC News noted that Charlene became one of Neighbours most popular characters.|$|E

2500|$|Author Naoko Takeuchi {{describes}} Chibiusa as a precocious brat {{who likes}} pulling pranks. She {{is the daughter}} of Neo-Queen Serenity and King Endymion. Her real name is the same as her mother's, but is called Chibiusa in Japanese to avoid confusion between the two. Her name in several English-language versions of Sailor Moon, Rini, is a diminutive of [...] "Serena", the name of her mother. She is known for having pink hair put into a unique style that resembles rabbit ears <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Chibiusa's hair is apparently truly pink, and not just colored that way for stylistic purposes; its color is stated in the manga's first Picture Diary and in the poem about her in the Sailor Stars CD single.|$|E
60|$|The general {{atmosphere}} was easy and livable. Carl found himself at home again. Adelaide told funny anecdotes about her school of domestic science, {{and the chief}} teacher, who wore {{her hair in a}} walnut <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and interrupted a lecture on dietetics to chase a cockroach with a ruler.|$|E
6000|$|I took a carving-knife {{from off}} the table, and {{standing}} over her I brought it down gently <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "Rise, Sir Jane Puddle," [...] said I, {{to which the}} maid gave a smothered gasp, and--would you believe it, madam?--she crept {{out of the room}} on her hands and knees. The cook waited on us at breakfast, and I truly believe that the landlord and his wife {{breathed a sigh of relief}} when we left the Ship Inn, for their sordid souls had never heard of knighthood, but knew all about assassination.|$|E

6000|$|... "Come on with me," [...] he said, and {{the yellow}} papers flying in his hands, he dashed through a door and down some stairs, into the {{basement}} where the gas was burning. They crossed the cold, damp storeroom, then a long, dreary room with a long table on trestles, into a smaller, cosy apartment, not very high, which had been built on to the main building. In this room a small woman with a red serge blouse, and her black hair done <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> was waiting like a proud little bantam.|$|E
60|$|He {{was rather}} excited {{at the idea}} of meeting Clara at Willey Farm. Mrs. Dawes came for the day. Her heavy, dun-coloured hair was coiled <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> She wore a white blouse and navy skirt, and somehow, {{wherever}} she was, seemed to make things look paltry and insignificant. When she was in the room, the kitchen seemed too small and mean altogether. Miriam's beautiful twilighty parlour looked stiff and stupid. All the Leivers were eclipsed like candles. They found her rather hard to put up with. Yet she was perfectly amiable, but indifferent, and rather hard.|$|E
60|$|She {{loved his}} artist's paraphernalia, and the books, and {{the photos of}} people. Soon he was telling her: this was William, this was William's young lady in the evening dress, this was Annie and her husband, this was Arthur {{and his wife and}} the baby. She {{felt as if she were}} being taken into the family. He showed her photos, books, sketches, and they talked a little while. Then they {{returned}} to the kitchen. Mrs. Morel put aside her book. Clara wore a blouse of fine silk chiffon, with narrow black-and-white stripes; her hair was done simply, coiled <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> She looked rather stately and reserved.|$|E

60|$|When a {{young girl}} reaches {{eighteen}} she is recognised as being a woman. She adds six inches to her skirt, she unplaits her dangling braids and balls her hair <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> she stops sleeping with her little sister and has a room to herself, and becomes {{in many ways a}} thundering expense. But she is in society now; and papa has to stand it. There is no avoiding it. Very well. The Great Republic lengthened her skirts last year, balled up her hair, and entered the world's society. This means that, if she would prosper and stand fair with society, she must put aside some of her dearest and darlingest young ways and superstitions, and do as society does. Of course, she can decline if she wants to; but this would be unwise. She ought to realise, now that she has 'come out,' that this is a right and proper time to change a part of her style. She is in Rome; and it has long been granted that when one is in Rome it is good policy to do as Rome does. To advantage Rome? No--to advantage herself.|$|E
