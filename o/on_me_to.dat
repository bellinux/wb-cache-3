5|$|On October 10, 2011the {{day before}} Chandler's 65th birthdayFlorida Governor Rick Scott signed Chandler's death warrant. His {{execution}} {{was set for}} November 15, 2011, at 4:00pm. His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He {{is not going to make}} a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E

In 1987, Shiller, Nancy Kaszak, and Gerald Pechenuk challenged Orbach. Kaszak was a lawyer, a former {{vice president of the}} , a Mayor Harold Washington appointee to the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, a leader of the Lakeview Citizens' Council, and president of Citizens United for Baseball in Sunshine (CUBS), which opposed night baseball at Wrigley Field. Newfeld co-chaired Kaszak's campaign. Pechenuk was a consultant for Lyndon LaRouche Jr. for 12 years, and was treasurer of LaRouche-supported Sheila Jones's mayoral campaign. Shiller challenged Pechenuk's nominating petitions.|$|E

"Thinking {{back to when}} we met and {{the many}} times that we spent {{together}} and whenever we were out together, {{there would be a}} caption of some kind, and the caption usually said something like 'an odd couple' or 'an unlikely pair,' but to us it was the most natural and easiest of friendships.... Michael always knew he could count <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> support him or be his date and that we would have fun no matter where we were. We had a bond....

500|$|He joined Conference Premier rivals Cambridge United on {{a two-year}} {{contract}} for a £15,000 fee on 6 August 2008. His debut {{came in a}} 1–0 win away to Northwich Victoria on 9 August 2008, and scored his first goal with a stoppage time winner in a 1–0 home win over Lewes on 7 October 2008. Soon after he was told by manager Gary Brabin to provide more support for the team's strikers, with Challinor agreeing, saying [...] "It will put the added responsibility <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> start shooting and take some pressure off the forwards. If the midfield can get some goals as well, then {{that will help the}} team". He immediately followed this up with the winning goal against Weymouth in a 1–0 home win on 11 October 2008, coming from a low right-footed shot into the corner from 25yards.|$|E
500|$|Ezra Cornell, {{a self-made}} {{businessman}} and austere, pragmatic telegraph mogul, {{made his fortune}} on the Western Union Telegraph Company stock he received during the consolidation that led to its formation. [...] Cornell, who had been poor {{for most of his}} life, suddenly found himself looking for ways that he could do the greatest good for with his money. He wrote, [...] "My greatest care now is how to spend this large income to do the greatest good to those who are properly dependent <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> the poor and to posterity." [...] Cornell's self-education and hard work would lead him {{to the conclusion that the}} greatest end for his philanthropy was in the need of colleges for the teaching of practical pursuits such as agriculture, the applied sciences, veterinary medicine and engineering, and in finding opportunities for the poor to attain such an education.|$|E
500|$|Due to the Palm Beach media {{attention}} and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy's public image suffered. A Gallup Poll gave Kennedy {{a very low}} 22percent national approval rating. A Boston Herald/WCVB-TV poll found that 62 percent of Massachusetts citizens thought Kennedy should not run for re-election, by a 2-to-1 margin thought Kennedy had misled authorities in the Palm Beach investigation, and had Kennedy losing a hypothetical Senate race to Governor William Weld by 25points. Meanwhile, at a June 17, 1991, dinner party, Kennedy saw Victoria Anne Reggie, a Washington lawyer at Keck, Mahin & Cate, a divorced mother of two, and {{the daughter of an}} old Kennedy family ally, Louisiana judge Edmund Reggie. They began dating and by September were in a serious relationship. In a late October speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Kennedy sought to begin a political recovery, saying: [...] "I am painfully aware that the criticism directed at me in recent months involves far more than disagreements with my positions ... involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> fight the good fight. To them I say, I recognize my own shortcomings– the faults in the conduct of my private life. I realize that I alone am responsible for them, and I am the one who must confront them." [...] In December 1991, the William Kennedy Smith rape trial was held; it was nationally televised and the most watched until the O. J. Simpson murder case three years later. Kennedy's testimony at the trial seemed relaxed, confident, and forthcoming, and helped convince the public that his involvement had been peripheral and unintended. Smith was acquitted.|$|E

500|$|On February 1, 2008, Gasol {{was traded}} to the Los Angeles Lakers along with a 2010 second round draft pick for Kwame Brown, Javaris Crittenton, Aaron McKie, the rights to Marc Gasol (Pau's younger brother), and 2008 and 2010 first round draft picks. There has been some {{controversy}} surrounding the trade. Chris Wallace denied in an ESPN article that he had been ordered by owner Michael Heisley to make the Grizzlies more attractive to a potential buyer. Wallace said, [...] "No one put pressure <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do this, and Michael Heisley has actually been reluctant to move Pau." [...] He also said that they had been [...] "trolling" [...] the waters for a while and dealt with a number of teams. He selected the Lakers deal because [...] "it didn't get any better than this." [...] When Gasol departed the Grizzlies, he held twelve franchise records, including games played, minutes played, field goals made, free throws made and attempted, offensive, defensive, and total rebounds, blocked shots, turnovers, and points. Per game statistics, he leads Memphis in defensive and total rebounds along with blocked shots. On February 5, he made his first Lakers appearance in a game against the New Jersey Nets, during which he scored 24 points and had 12 rebounds in a 105–90 win over the Nets. On March 14, Gasol sprained his ankle in a game against the New Orleans Hornets, stepping on the foot of teammate Vladimir Radmanović in the first quarter. Gasol was expected to miss the remaining three games of the Lakers' road trip after x-rays came up negative. Gasol returned to the starting lineup on April 2 against the Portland Trail Blazers and played nearly thirty-two minutes, registering 10 points, six rebounds and seven assists. He admitted to feeling limited with the swelling in his ankle still present. Gasol helped the Lakers finish the regular season with {{the best record in the}} Western Conference (57–25), with him in the starting lineup the Lakers went 22–5. Kobe Bryant has also stated that playing with Gasol clicked from the start.|$|E

He was trained at Parris Island, South Carolina, and was a combat correspondent with the 3rd Marine Division. Having been reared in a segregationist society, Tiner recalled having been [...] "thrown together in boot camp, black and white people from the South. All of that made a very profound impact <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> see black Marines getting shot and dying for their country. I {{came back with the}} very clear idea that something's not right about this, {{that it was time to}} change how we did things in this country." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the post-war}} period progressed, Abe's stance as an {{intellectual}} pacifist led to him joining the Japanese Communist Party, with whom he worked to organize laborers in poor parts of Tokyo. Soon after his reception of the Akutagawa Prize in 1951, Abe began to feel {{the constraints of the}} Communist Party's rules and regulations alongside doubts about what meaningful artistic works could be created under the title of [...] "socialist realism." [...] By 1956, Abe began writing in solidarity with the Polish rebels and their freedom movement, drawing the ire of the Japanese Communist Party. The Party's criticism reaffirmed his stance: [...] "The Communist Party put pressure <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> change the content of the article and apologize. But I refused. I said I would never change my opinion on the matter. This was my first break with the Party." [...] The next year, Abe traveled to Eastern Europe for the Twentieth Convention of the Soviet Communist Party. Here, Abe saw little of interest, but the arts gave him some solace. He visited Kafka's house in Prague, read Rilke and Karel Čapek, reflected on his idol Lu Xun, and was moved by a Mayakovsky play in Brno.|$|E
2500|$|Controversy arose {{before the}} start of the 1976 season when Golden Gaters {{co-owner}} Larry King acting in his capacity as WTT president changed the date of a match between the Pittsburgh Triangles and Boston Lobsters from May 8 to May 16, to free up Evonne Goolagong for a promotional event. Triangles owner Frank Fuhrer protested the change and called for a vote of the owners to overrule the decision. The Golden Gaters abstained from voting. The Lobsters, who were hosting the match in question, voted to accept the schedule change. However, Fuhrer got six other owners to side with him to overrule King's decision. Later, the sponsor of the promotional event appealed to Fuhrer personally and bought $10,000 worth of tickets to two Triangles matches resulting in Fuhrer accepting the schedule change. The conflicts of interest that were pervasive throughout WTT clearly caused dissent among some owners. Fuhrer was quoted as saying, [...] "We're the defending champs, and I'm not having Larry King change my schedule <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> accommodate his own interests. We're going to get all the conflict of interest out of this league." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sharp used {{to treat}} poor Londoners at his house. One night, he was asked for help by a slave who had been beaten by his owner. Sharp treated the man but also {{discussed}} the case with his brother, Granville Sharp. The man was called Jonathan Strong {{and he had been}} so badly beaten that he was blind and required four months of treatment at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Sharp met the expense of Strong's recovery and arranging his employment with a pharmacist. However, two years later, while Strong was serving as a footman on the pharmacist's coach, he was seen by his owner, David Lisle, who sold him to a Jamaican planter and had him kidnapped. Strong got a message to Granville Sharp, who immediately took the matter up with the Lord Mayor of London, who called a hearing and declared Strong to be now free. Lisle challenged Granville Sharp to a duel, but he declined, later explaining [...] "David Lisle, Esquire, (a man of the law) called <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> demand gentlemanlike satisfaction. I told him that as he had studied the law so many years, he should want no satisfaction that the law could give him." [...] The English courts ultimately sided with the Sharp brothers, denying an application that they should pay Lisle two hundred pounds in damages for taking another man's property. From this encounter, Sharp's younger brother Granville went on to become an early advocate for the abolition of slavery and remained so for fifty years.|$|E

2500|$|He was honoured on {{the first}} anniversary of his death by a {{memorial}} concert in Brooklyn, which featured performances from Johnny Osbourne, Micky Jarrett, Delano Tucker, and Half Pint. In 2001, a charitable trust was set up in Brown's name. The Dennis Emanuel Brown Trust works to educate youngsters, maintain and advance the memory of Dennis Brown, and help to provide youngsters with musical instruments. The trust awards the Dennis Emanuel Brown (DEB) bursary for educational achievement each year to students between the ages of 10 and 12 years. In 2005, George Nooks, who had worked with Brown in the mid-1970s in his deejay guise as Prince Mohamed, released an album of Brown covers, George Nooks Sings Dennis Brown: The Voice Lives On, with Nooks stating: [...] "I was always inspired by his talent and I used to sing like him. Dennis had a large influence <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> <b>To</b> me he was the greatest. He was my number one singer." [...] In the same year, Gregory Isaacs paid a similar tribute with the album Gregory Isaacs Sings Dennis Brown. In February 2007, a series of events were staged in Jamaica in celebration of the lives of both Brown and Marley (both would have had birthdays that month). In 2008, the Dennis Brown Trust announced a new internet radio station, dedicated solely to the music of Dennis Brown, and in the same month a tribute concert was staged by the Jamaican Association of Vintage Artistes and Affiliates (JAVAA) featuring Dwight Pinkney, Derrick Harriott, Sugar Minott, George Nooks, and John Holt.|$|E
2500|$|Toot is {{the same}} cousin who tried to steer T.I. toward {{positivity}} and is most notably shouted out on [...] "Rubber Band Man". Jay-Ru was a buddy T.I. used to hustle with. The two had a falling out and Jay-Ru died before the two {{had a chance to}} reconcile. [...] "Me and Jay-Ru was still close partners," [...] T.I. explained. [...] "We lived together, we was in the streets hustling together. I had got involved with my older son's mom at the time. I moved out of the apartment into my own spot with her.

[...] I was thinking about everybody who could play the piano as well as sing, and Jamie {{was at the top of}} my list". [...] T.

2500|$|Former German Federal Minister of Labor Norbert Blüm {{was honored}} with the 2001 Leipzig Human Rights Award. [...] Blüm was {{recognized}} {{because he had}} [...] "championed human rights and religious freedom in the discussion with the totalitarian Scientology Organization." [...] The Award again contained a picture of Leipzig's St. Nicholas Church, and Blüm was presented with the Award at a ceremony in Leipzig at a site near the Leipzig Trade Fair on June 10, 2001. [...] In {{an interview with the}} junge Welt on June 11, 2001, Blüm was asked why it takes courage to be a politician critical of the Scientology, and he cited actions the Church of Scientology had taken against him: [...] "Scientology acts on people's fears. For instance they threatened me by saying they would distribute their dossier <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> television. They've called me all kinds of names in their newspaper: the [...] "Rasputin" [...] of politics, for example." [...] Blüm also stated in the interview that he did not support a ban on Scientology in Germany, but rather sought to foster the distribution of information about the organization. [...] He also compared what he saw as totalitarian similarities between the ideologies of L. Ron Hubbard and Adolf Hitler, noting that he was not comparing the individuals themselves but rather their [...] "totalitarian systems." [...] At the awards presentation, Thomas Gandow stated that Blüm was the only federal minister to date to criticize Scientology's [...] "new totalitarianism." [...] Gandow noted that Blüm had been criticized by Scientologists in the press, and was sued in court for his actions critical of the organization. [...] The Scientology Church Germany, Inc. characterized the Award as a [...] "cynical mockery of the most elementary basic rights and of the East German civil rights movement," [...] and referred to the Awards Committee as [...] "a dubious clan of fanatical religious discriminators." ...|$|E
