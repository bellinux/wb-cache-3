5|$|The Epistles are {{admired for}} the way that their poetry and music fit so well together. Bellman chose not to compose the tunes, instead {{borrowing}} and adapting existing melodies, most likely to exploit the humour of contrasting the associations <b>of</b> <b>well-known</b> tunes with the meanings he gave them. This {{may also have been}} intended to provide historical depth to his work; he sometimes devoted considerable energy to adapting melodies to fit an Epistle's needs.|$|E

Bhima Kavi's work, a biography of Basavanna, is an important Veerashaiva purana. It was inspired by earlier biographies of Basavanna by the Hoysala poet Harihara (the author of the first biographical narrative poem of the protagonist's life called Basavaraja Ragale) and the Telugu writings of Palkuriki Somanatha of the 13th century. Bhima Kavi humbly acknowledges and eulogises his predecessors in a writing full <b>of</b> <b>well-known</b> personalities.|$|E
5|$|Bottomley {{was born}} on 23 March 1860, at 16 Saint Peter's Street, Bethnal Green in London, the second child and only son of William Bottomley, a tailor's cutter, and Elizabeth, née Holyoake. William Bottomley's {{background}} is obscure, but Elizabeth belonged to a family <b>of</b> <b>well-known</b> radical agitators—her brother George Jacob Holyoake was {{a founder of the}} Secularist movement and in later life a leading figure in the growth of Co-operative societies. Among Holyoake's close associates was Charles Bradlaugh, who founded the National Republican League and became a controversial Member of Parliament. A longstanding friendship between Bradlaugh and Elizabeth Holyoake led to rumours that he, not William Bottomley, was Horatio's biological father—a suggestion that Bottomley, in later life, was prone to encourage. The evidence is circumstantial, mainly based on the marked facial resemblance between Bradlaugh and Bottomley.|$|E
5|$|Iravan, {{also known}} as Iravat and Iravant, is a minor {{character}} from the Hindu epic of Mahabharata. The son of Pandava prince Arjuna (one of the main heroes of the Mahabharata) and the Naga princess Ulupi, Iravan is the central deity of the cult of Kuttantavar {{which is also the}} name commonly given to him in that cult—and {{plays a major role in}} the cult of Draupadi. Both these cults are of Tamil origin, from a region of the country where he is worshipped as a village deity and is known as Aravan. He is also a patron god <b>of</b> <b>well-known</b> transgender communities called ThiruNangai (also Aravani in Tamil, and Hijra throughout South Asia).|$|E

5|$|Malouma Mint Moktar Ould Meidah {{was born}} in Mederdra in the Trarza Region of {{south-western}} Mauritania, on October 1, 1960, the year the country gained independence from France.

Her father, Mokhtar Ould Meidah, was a celebrated singer, tidinet player and poet while her grandfather, Mohamed Yahya Ould Boubane, is remembered as a talented writer and tidinet virtuoso.

5|$|Most of {{the major}} musical {{organizations}} in Baltimore were founded by musicians who trained at the Peabody Institute's Conservatory of Music. These include Baltimore Choral Arts, Baltimore Opera Company (BOC), and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (BSO). These organizations all have excellent reputations and sponsor numerous performances throughout the year. Baltimore has produced a number <b>of</b> <b>well-known</b> modern composers of classical and art music, most famously including Philip Glass, a minimalist composer and Christopher Rouse, a Pulitzer winner. Glass {{grew up in the}} 1940s, working in his father's record store in East Baltimore, selling African American records, then known as race music. He was there exposed to Baltimore jazz and rhythm and blues.|$|E
5|$|The {{large amount}} of space in rural cemeteries permits the use of {{sculpture}} {{in a way that}} the crowded churchyard has never allowed. Many rural cemeteries, including Oakwood, subsequently became virtual outdoor sculpture museums, displaying the works <b>of</b> <b>well-known</b> contemporary sculptors as memorials to the deceased. Oakwood is home to thousands of individual statues and sculptures as well as 24 private mausolea. Because of its popularity as a public park, many memorials included benches to invite visitors to rest while investigating the large, hilly property.|$|E

5|$|The {{publisher}} of paperbacks, Penguin Books, introduced {{a range of}} books for children under the Puffin Books brand in 1939. At first these were non-fiction titles but these were soon followed by a fiction list <b>of</b> <b>well-known</b> authors. The demand {{was so great that}} Puffin Book Clubs were introduced in schools to encourage reading, and a children's magazine Puffin Post was established. There is a tradition on the Icelandic island of Heimaey for the children to rescue young puffins, a fact recorded in Bruce McMillan's photo-illustrated children's book Nights of the Pufflings (1995). The fledglings emerge from the nest and try to {{make their way to the}} sea but sometimes get confused, perhaps by the street lighting, ending up by landing in the village. The children collect them and liberate them to the safety of the sea.|$|E

A variety of sailing and wind surfing options are on offer, {{as well as the}} usual beach activities. There are many other attractions and amusement arcades and a variety <b>of</b> <b>well-known</b> high street stores such as W H Smith and Boots, together with independent local shops. The town has both a Tesco and a Morrisons supermarket on its outskirts as well as a new Lidl.|$|E
5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles {{give rise}} to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles {{give rise to}} their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number <b>of</b> <b>well-known</b> genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E
