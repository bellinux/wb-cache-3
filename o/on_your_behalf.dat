2500|$|The {{substance}} of Suffolk's speech is [...] "As I {{was instructed to}} marry Margaret <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>behalf,</b> I did so, and now I deliver her to you." [...] However, the formality of the scene {{and the importance of}} the event require him to deliver this message in heightened language, with the formal significance of Henry's marriage to Margaret mirrored in the formal language used by Suffolk to announce that marriage.|$|E

Nothing was advanced <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>behalf</b> to reflect that there is even the faintest glimmer of hope for you. Even if there were, any considerations of rehabilitation must, in this case, be subordinated to the gravity of your offending, {{the need for the}} imposition of a just punishment, and the principle of general deterrence. All those circumstances combine, in my view, not only to justify, but also to require that I do not fix a minimum term." ...|$|E
2500|$|Increasing media {{scrutiny}} {{based upon}} allegations by former members placed further pressure on Jones in 1977, in particular, {{an article by}} Marshall Kilduff in New West Magazine. Just before publication of the New West piece, editor Rosalie Wright telephoned Jones to read him the article. Wright explained that she was only doing so before publication because of [...] "all the support letters we received <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>behalf,</b> from the Governor of California (Jerry Brown)" [...] and others. While still on the phone listening to the allegations contained in the article, Jones wrote a note to Temple members {{in the room with}} him that said, [...] "We leave tonight. Notify Georgetown (Guyana)." ...|$|E

5000|$|Throughout his career, some of Loach's {{films have}} been shelved for {{political}} reasons. In a 2011 interview with The Guardian newspaper he said: [...] It makes you angry, not <b>on</b> <b>your</b> own <b>behalf,</b> but <b>on</b> {{behalf of the}} people whose voices weren't allowed to be heard. When you had trade unions, ordinary people, rank and file, never been on television, never been interviewed, and they're {{not allowed to be}} heard, that's scandalous.|$|R

"You will do well, sir," [...] {{he muttered}} sourly, [...] "to address the Lord <b>on</b> <b>your</b> own <b>behalf.</b> As for {{that young man}} of Baal, your master, rejoice not yet in his escape. By the same {{crowning}} mercy in which the Lord hath vouchsafed us victory to-day shall He also deliver the malignant youth into my hands.

I can only say that I have endeavoured to act up to the teaching of Monsieur de Turenne, and I felt sure that although my methods might at first seem irksome to some of you, their value would gradually become appreciated. I am scarcely less pleased at the decrease in drunkenness, and at the general improvement in the men, than by the increase of discipline and efficiency." ...|$|R

6000|$|It {{is quite}} horrid {{for me to}} have to tell you (and after a little delay caused by a glut of correspondence, at once, and a {{pressure}} of other occupations) that <b>your</b> gentle appeal, <b>on</b> <b>your</b> friend's <b>behalf,</b> in the matter of the [...] "favourite quotation," [...] finds me utterly helpless and embarrassed. The perverse collectress proposes, I fear, to collect the impossible! I haven't a favourite quotation--absolutely not: any more than I have a favourite day in the year, a favourite letter in the alphabet or a favourite wave in the sea! And the collectress, in general, has ever found me dark and dumb and odious, and I am too aged and obstinate and brutal to change! Such is the sorry tale I have to ask you all patiently to hear. I wish you were, or had been, coming over to see me from Canterbury--instead of labouring in that barren vineyard of other friendship.

[...] "I shall be glad to know whether that respectable person, Mr. Western, comes back again. I don't think she'll have a good time if he does, and if he don't I sha'n't break my heart." [...] Then he put his pen down and sat for a while {{thinking}} what should be his last paragraph. Should he put an end to all his doubts and straightway make his offer, or should he dally a little longer and still keep the power in his own hands? At last he said to himself that even if he wrote it his letter would not go till to-morrow morning, and he would have the night to think about it. This consideration got the better of his prudence and he did write it, simply beginning a new sentence on the page. [...] "Don't you think that you and I know each other well enough to make a match of it? There is a question for you to answer <b>on</b> <b>your</b> own <b>behalf,</b> instead of blowing me up for any cruelty to Cecilia Holt." ...|$|R

There was not on Lady Noel's part any [...] exaggeration of the facts; nor, so far as I could perceive, any [...] determination to prevent a return to Lord Byron: certainly none was [...] expressed when I spoke of a reconciliation. When you came to town, in [...] about a fortnight, or perhaps more, after my first interview with Lady [...] Noel, I was for the first time informed by you of facts utterly [...] unknown, as I have no doubt, to Sir Ralph and Lady Noel. On receiving [...] this additional information, my opinion was entirely changed: I [...] considered a reconciliation impossible. I declared my opinion, and [...] added, that, if such an idea should be entertained, I could not, [...] either professionally or otherwise, take any part towards effecting [...] it.|$|R

5000|$|In June 1992, R. U. Sirius, {{publisher}} of the magazine Mondo 2000, {{came up with an}} interesting idea. Publicists from U2 had contacted him regarding the possibility of interviewing Dave [...] "The Edge" [...] Evans, hoping to promote U2's impending multimillion-dollar Zoo TV Tour, which featured found sounds and live sampling from mass media outlets (things for which Negativland had been known for some time). Sirius, unbeknownst to Edge, decided to have his friends Joyce and Hosler of Negativland conduct the interview. Joyce and Hosler, fresh from Island's lawsuit, peppered the Edge with questions regarding his ideas about the use of sampling in their new tour, and the legality of using copyrighted material without permission. Midway through the interview, Joyce and Hosler revealed their identities as members of Negativland. An embarrassed Edge reported that U2 were bothered by the sledgehammer legal approach Island Records took in their lawsuit, and furthermore that much of the legal wrangling took place without U2's knowledge: [...] "by the time we U2 realized what was going on it was kinda too late, and we actually did approach the record company <b>on</b> <b>your</b> Negativland's <b>behalf</b> and said, 'Look, c'mon, this is just, this is very heavy...'" [...] Island Records reported to Negativland that U2 never authorized samples of their material; Evans' response was, [...] "that's complete bollocks, there's like, there's at least six records out there that are direct samples from our stuff." ...|$|R
