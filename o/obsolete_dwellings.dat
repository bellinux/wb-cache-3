Arising out of 'Greening the Greyfields', a federally funded, inter-state project examining the feasibility of redevelopment in the middle suburbs, ENVISION was produced as a GIS-based, Participatory Support System, for engaging with the diverse array of stakeholders involved in urban redevelopment. This system was designed to bring wide-ranging land, demographic and market data together to highlight the redevelopment options, and identify potential redevelopment precincts, across metropolitan centres, with the aim of initiating debate between those involved on how best to manage urban growth. The result of this project has seen ENVISION being used at a state and municipal level, where workshops based on its use have begun to highlight the barriers to redevelopment as well as the ways forward for more sustainable redevelopment in the urban Greyfields (middle suburbs with high levels of un-planned redevelopment, high incidences of culturally and technologically <b>obsolete</b> <b>dwellings,</b> on land that is highly undercapitalised). Based on the communicative and deliberative models of community engagement, ENVISION has shown that geo-tools can have considerable affect in the mutual education of stakeholders, in extracting the pertinent issues and potential barriers to redevelopment, and in encouraging groups of experts to produce novel solutions to 'wicked' problems that they could not, without the collaboration that the tool demands, resolve on their own. Ultimately this project highlights the ability of GIS to not only provide an interface to real-time data manipulation, but its power {{to be used as a}} tool for communicative education between the diverse perspectives within a politically, technologically, financially and culturally sensitive area...|$|E

By providing cheap housing, workers could also be persuaded to accept lower salaries, therefore keeping production costs down. In 1940, Playford introduced the Housing Improvement Act to parliament, having seen {{the benefits of the}} Housing Trust's activities. The main aims of the legislation were [...] "to improve the adverse housing conditions" [...] by replacing [...] "insanitary, old, crowded, or <b>obsolete</b> <b>dwelling</b> houses" [...] with better-quality buildings—at the time many older residences in the city centre were made of corrugated iron and many areas were slum-like. The law forced landlords to provide a minimum standard of housing and enacted rent controls, setting a maximum rent for various houses; at the time many landlords bought large numbers of low-quality dwellings and charged tenants exorbitant prices. It also expanded the role of the Housing Trust, potentially undercutting the rentier class. Labor were taken aback by Playford's move, as this was the start of a trend whereby the nominally conservative government pursued policies that were more left-wing than other Labor governments across the country. After expressing shock at Playford's [...] "loving kindness to the poor and distressed", Labor helped to get the legislation—which threatened the interests of the landlord class that traditionally supported the LCL—passed into law. During one 15-year period, Housing Trust rents were not increased once despite steady inflation.|$|R
