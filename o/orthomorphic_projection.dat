The quality of the outputs is depending on how good a reference system is defined. The existing reference system is based on Rectified Skew <b>Orthomorphic</b> <b>Projection</b> (RSO), which is projected from Malayan Revised Triangulation (MRT) system. Many researches have been carried out to get a global coordinate system that suite with earthâ€™s surface. A new datum also called geocentric datum, which is the origin referred to the origin of the earth, gives the best surface reference system for the entire world. In remote sensing applications, datum system (transformation) is important factor to gather spatial data for determination of coordinate location. By using the RSOgeodetic datum and RSOgeocentric datum as reference surfaces, geometry correction has been performed in terms to see the differences. The results shows that the average RMS errors is 0. 2867 meter for north KL and 0. 3306 meter for south KL from twelve checkm points that are measured. Then, the Z-test is carried out and the result shows that the errors of the checkpoints are accepted in 95 percent of confident level. From the comparison analyses between RSOgeodetic and RSOgeocentric coordinate datum, show that the coordinates changes happen as much as 194. 0 meter to 195. 0 meter...|$|E

This is the property of orthomorphism (from Greek 'right shape'). The qualification 'small' means that at some given accuracy of measurement no change can be detected in the scale factor over the element. Since conformal projections have an isotropic scale factor they have also been called <b>orthomorphic</b> <b>projections.</b> For example, the Mercator projection is conformal since it is constructed to preserve angles and its scale factor is isotopic, a function of latitude only: Mercator does preserve shape in small regions.|$|R

In contrast, mappings that are not conformal distort most such small circles into ellipses of distortion.

These are some conformal projections: ...|$|R

These environmentally sensitive areas are under intense pressure from natural processes, urban growth, resources development, and pollution. These threats have made the coastal zone a priority for shoreline monitoring programs. This research utilizes multi-temporal satellite imagery to monitor shoreline changes from 1992 to 2009 at Seberang Takir, Terengganu, Malaysia through the use of image processing algorithm and statistical analysis. All the imagery was geo-rectified to the Malaysian Rectified Skew <b>Orthomorphic</b> (MRSO) <b>projection</b> and analysis was done to detect spatially significant areas with erosion and accretion along the shoreline and detect potential sources of the changes. The shoreline was divided into 16 sited and shoreline changes at the sites were determined based on satellite sensor imagery. Preliminary result show erosion occurring near to human activities Northeast of Kuala Terengganu shoreline while southwest of Kuala Terengganu was subjected more to accretion...|$|R
