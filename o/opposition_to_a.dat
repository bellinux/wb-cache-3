5|$|Although a {{potential}} local ownership group was identified in late February, local <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> perceived bailout of multi-millionaire ownership {{began to take}} hold. A citizens opposition group called Don't Target Us (referencing the Target Center in their name) formed to voice their <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> public purchase of the facility. Additionally, polling at the time showed support for public intervention as being unfavorable with 60 {{percent of those polled}} being against intervention.

5|$|A {{debate on}} whether the {{military}} photos {{should or should not}} be released to the public has taken place. Those supporting the release argued that the photos should be considered public records, that the photos are necessary to complete the journalistic record, and that the photos would prove bin Laden's death and therefore prevent conspiracy theories that bin Laden is still alive. Those in <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> release of the photos expressed concern that the photos would inflame anti-American sentiment in the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|Atrash {{supported}} {{formation of}} the United Arab Republic (UAR), a union between Syria and Egypt, in 1958. During the UAR years, Atrash became a devoted Nasserite—a supporter of President Gamal Abdel Nasser's policies—and wrote several articles in Nasserite daily newspaper Al Jamahir ("The People.") Atrash opposed the break-up of the union after a secessionist coup in September 1961, and opposed playing a political role in the anti-unionist governments that succeeded the UAR; Prime Minister Bashir al-Azma (term in 1962) offered him a cabinet post, but he turned down the offer, citing his ideological <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> secessionist government. Prime Minister Khalid al-Azm (term in 1962–63) appointed him minister of social affairs without asking him, but Atrash turned down that job as well.|$|E

2500|$|Polls with leading information, {{such as a}} Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg {{poll taken}} June 24–27, 2006, asking [...] "If Iran {{continues}} to produce material {{that can be used}} to develop nuclear weapons, would you support or oppose the U.S. taking military action against Iran?", mostly gave minority <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> attack on Iran. This Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll gave minority (about 40 percent) <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> attack. A Newsweek Poll taken on October 19–20, 2006 with the leading information [...] "if that country [...] continues its efforts to develop nuclear weapons" [...] gave a large majority (76 percent) opposed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> land attack and a small majority (54 percent) opposed <b>to</b> <b>an</b> air attack, conditional on the claim in the leading information.|$|R

5|$|In 1549, {{a series}} of uprisings known as the Prayer Book Rebellion forced Vermigli to leave Oxford and take up {{residence}} at Lambeth Palace with Cranmer. The rebellion involved conservative <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vernacular liturgy, which was imposed with the Book of Common Prayer at Pentecost in 1549. Rioters {{in the streets of}} Oxford threatened Vermigli with death. At Lambeth, Vermigli assisted Cranmer by helping write sermons against the rebellion. After some time he returned to Oxford, where he was made first canon of Christ Church in January 1551. Vermigli, the first married priest at Oxford, caused controversy by bringing his wife into his rooms overlooking Fish Street at the Great Quadrangle. His windows were smashed several times until he moved to a location in the cloisters, where he built a fortified stone study.|$|E
5|$|In December, after former East German leader Erich Honecker {{was issued}} {{an arrest warrant}} by {{prosecutors}} in Berlin and charged with giving orders to fire on escapees, Snetkov refused to hand over Honecker, who was under Soviet protection at a military hospital. He opposed the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Germany, and stated in multiple early 2000s interviews with Russian military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda that his <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Soviet pull-out {{was the reason for}} his dismissal from command of the WGF later that month. However, according to a contemporary Izvestia report, he was fired along with deputies after the desertions of a regimental commander and a supply unit leader on 29 November, who took two missiles, three tank shells and other armaments with them. After his dismissal, Snetkov joined the Group of Inspectors General of the Ministry of Defense, traditionally a pre-retirement post for elderly generals. He retired in May 1992 after the elimination of the Group of Inspectors General.|$|E
5|$|Shelley {{uses the}} {{historical}} novel {{to comment on}} gender relations; for example, Valperga is a feminist version of Scott's masculinist genre. Introducing women into the story who {{are not part of}} the historical record, Shelley uses their narratives to question established theological and political institutions. Shelley sets the male protagonist's compulsive greed for conquest in <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> female alternative: reason and sensibility. In Perkin Warbeck, Shelley's other historical novel, Lady Gordon stands for the values of friendship, domesticity, and equality. Through her, Shelley offers a feminine alternative to the masculine power politics that destroy the male characters. The novel provides a more inclusive historical narrative to challenge the one which usually relates only masculine events.|$|E

5|$|Solis was not {{a member}} of the Education and the Workforce Committee, but championed the Employee Free Choice Act and was the only member of Congress on the board of American Rights at Work, a pro-union {{organization}} that strongly supports the act, for whom she served as treasurer starting in 2004. On trade she voted against both the Dominican Republic–Central America trade agreement and the U.S.-Peru trade agreement, and also expressed <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> purposed bilateral U.S.-Colombia trade agreement, citing concerns about human rights violations. Solis opposed legislation that would soften job safety requirements. She received 100percent ratings from several pro-labor groups for the years 2005 through 2007, and was a major recipient of union political donations. United Farm Workers co-founder Dolores Huerta is one of Solis's role models.|$|E
5|$|The Anahuac Disturbances {{coincided with}} a Mexican civil war. Texians aligned {{themselves}} with proponents of federalism advocating a stronger role for state governments, in <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> centralized government that set most policies at the national level. The federalists prevailed, and their favored general, Antonio López de Santa Anna, was elected president. In 1835, Santa Anna began consolidating power; in response federalists launched armed rebellion in several Mexican states. Travis, an ardent foe of centralism, led an attack on Anahuac in June 1835 and forced the Mexican garrison to surrender. Many Texas settlers thought Travis's action was imprudent, and {{he was forced to}} apologize. Although the Mexican government issued a warrant for his arrest, local authorities did not enforce it.|$|E
5|$|The Mint {{had trouble}} {{striking}} the new design. This {{was due to}} the hard copper-nickel alloy {{and the fact that the}} eagle on one side of the piece was directly opposite parts of the reverse design; efforts to bring out the design more fully led to increased die breakage. Many Flying Eagle cents show weaknesses, especially at the eagle's head and tail, which are opposite the wreath. In 1857, Snowden suggested the replacement of the eagle with a head of Christopher Columbus. Longacre replied that as there had been objections to proposals to place George Washington on the coinage, there would also be <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Columbus design. Despite the difficulties, the 17,450,000 Flying Eagle cents struck at Philadelphia in 1857 constituted the greatest production of a single coin in a year at a U.S. mint to that time.|$|E

5|$|The South financed a {{much lower}} {{proportion}} of its expenditures through direct taxes than the North. The share of direct taxes in total revenue for the North was about 20%, while for the South the same share was only about 8%. A {{major part of the}} reason why tax revenue did not play as large a role for the Confederacy was the individual states' <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> strong central government and the belief in states' rights which precluded giving too much taxing power to the government in Richmond. Another factor for not extending the tax system more broadly was the belief, present in both the North and the South, that the war would be of limited duration, and hence there was no compelling reason to increase the tax burden.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, the MCC was {{involved}} in controversy over the non-selection of the mixed-race cricketer Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa, which was then under apartheid. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira, himself South African-born, in the England team because of his colour. The MCC were aware that there was <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tour taking place, and that D'Oliveira's place in the team would be an issue, but wanted the tour to go ahead. The Shadow Foreign Secretary and former MCC President Sir Alec Douglas-Home visited South Africa in January 1968 and met the South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, who privately did not want D'Oliveira to come to South Africa under any circumstances. Vorster suggested to Douglas-Home that the MCC should not explicitly ask whether D'Oliveira's selection would be acceptable, {{but that it was}} likely no protest would be made. Douglas-Home passed this information to the MCC and advised them not to push for an answer. They had earlier written to the South African Cricket Association to establish whether they had a free hand in choosing a team, but their change of strategy meant that when the official reply arrived Allen refused to take receipt of it. In his biography of D'Oliveira, Peter Oborne writes that Allen and the MCC secretary Billy Griffith wished to hide any South African reply from the full MCC Committee to avoid raising awkward questions over Vorster's intentions.|$|E
5|$|The decade {{following}} {{ratification of}} the PTBT (1963–72) featured more US nuclear tests than the decade prior (1953–62). In the following decade, the US conducted 385 nuclear tests and 23 peaceful nuclear explosions (PNEs), versus 268 tests and three PNEs in the preceding decade. In contrast, the number of Soviet detonations fell from 218 in the preceding decade to 157 in the following decade, as the Soviet Union {{was never able to}} meet the pace of US underground explosions. China and France, both non-signatories, conducted 53 tests between 1963 and 1973. In all, 436 tests were conducted between the signing of the PTBT and 1 July 1973, compared to 499 tests between 16 July 1945 and the signing of the PTBT. In the 1960s and 1970s, China conducted 22 atmospheric tests and France conducted 50. The last atmospheric test was conducted by China in 1980, after French atmospheric testing stopped in 1974. Public opposition to nuclear testing continued following the treaty's enactment. Greenpeace was founded in 1971 in <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> planned underground test on the Alaskan island of Amchitka. In 1982, a Greenpeace ship docked at Leningrad without permission demanding that the Soviet Union stop testing.|$|E

5|$|Well {{before the}} American victory at Buena Vista, {{political}} clubs were formed which supported Taylor for President. His support {{was drawn from}} an unusually broad assortment of political bands, including Whigs and Democrats, Northerners and Southerners, allies and opponents of national leaders such as Henry Clay and James K. Polk. By late 1846 Taylor's <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> presidential run began to weaken, and {{it became clear that}} his principles more closely resembled Whig orthodoxy. Still, he maintained that he would only accept election as a national, independent figure, rather than a partisan loyalist. Taylor declared, as the 1848 Whig Party convention approached, that he had always been a Whig in principle, but he did consider himself a Jeffersonian-Democrat. Many southerners believed that Taylor supported slavery and its expansion into the new territory absorbed from Mexico, and some were angered when Taylor suggested that if he were elected President he would not veto the Wilmot Proviso, which proposed against such an expansion. This position did not enhance his support from activist antislavery elements in the Northern U.S., as these wanted Taylor to speak out strongly in support of the Proviso, not simply fail to veto it. Most abolitionists did not support Taylor, since he was a slave-owner. Many southerners also knew that Taylor supported states' rights and was opposed to protective tariffs and government spending for internal improvements. The Whigs hoped that he put the federal union of the United States above all else.|$|E
