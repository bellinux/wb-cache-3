5000|$|Carbon ribbons are on {{rolls and}} are fitted onto a spindle or reel holder within the printer. The used ribbon is rewound by a take-up spindle forming {{a roll of}} ‘used’ ribbon.

If one were to hold a strip of used carbon ribbon {{up to the light}} one would see an exact negative of the images that have been printed. The main benefit of using a <b>one-trip</b> thermal transfer ribbon is that providing the correct settings are applied prior to printing, an 100% density of printed image is guaranteed; compare this with a pre-inked ribbon on a dot matrix impact printer ribbon which gradually fades with usage.|$|E

5000|$|Through {{the latter}} part of the 20th century, most British brewers used a {{standard}} design of bottle, known as the London Brewers' Standard. This was in brown glass, with a conical medium neck in the pint and with a rounded shoulder in the half-pint and nip sizes. Pints, defined as 568 ml, and half-pints, or 284 ml were the most common, but some brewers also bottled in nip (1/3-pint) and quart (2-pint) sizes. It was for example mostly barley wines that were bottled in nips, and Midlands breweries such as Shipstone of Nottingham that bottled in quarts. This standardisation simplified the automation of bottling and made it easier for customers to recycle bottles as they were interchangeable. They carried a deposit charge, which in the 1980s rose to seven pence for a pint and five pence for a half-pint. Some brewers however used individual bottle designs: among these were Samuel Smith, which used an [...] clear bottle, and Scottish and Newcastle, which used a clear bottle for their Newcastle Brown Ale (both designs survive in the 500 ml size today). Other brewers such as Timothy Taylor had used their own embossed bottles and rare examples continued to be reused into the 1980s. During the 1980s the industry turned away from refillable bottles and UK beer bottles are now all <b>one-trip,</b> and most are 500 ml (16.9 U.S. fl oz; 17.6 imp fl oz) or 330 ml in volume. The compulsory high recycled-content of these bottles makes them very dark and the lack of temper makes them chip easily when being opened.|$|E
40|$|We propose TCP-L, an {{improved}} version of TCP, {{equipped with a}} learning algorithm whose purpose is to avoid probing for additional bandwidth when the network conditions {{are known to be}} unfavourable. TCP-L learns the relationship between its current (average) <b>one-trip</b> delay and its current window size when congestion occurs, leading to packet loss. After the learning phase, TCP-L will only probe for bandwidth by increasing its window if, under the current network conditions (measured by the <b>one-trip</b> delay), this inflated window has not previously created congestion. Simulations show that after the learning phase, TCP-L reaches a much more stable throughput, while remaining TCP-friendly, which makes it usable for a larger class of applications, including some multimedia applications that will benefit from that stability. TCP-L is a simple backward compatible extension of TCP which can thus be deployed progressively. We show that there is a benefit for the Internet to deploy TCP-L, because the overall tra#c becomes smoother when the proportion of TCP-L flows increases. Finally, our learning component can also be easily embedded in other unicast or multicast transport protocols...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to {{the demand}} of {{exploiting}} the poor-thin oil layer in Daqing oilfield, Y 422 retrievable fracture bridge plug is designed. Match usage of this bridge plug and other instruments can fracture multiple oil reservoirs with <b>one-trip</b> string, which {{is characterized by}} simple technology and safety operation. This bridge plug has realistic significance and practical value for improving oilfield economic benefits and provides an extensive application prospect. After setting process, the slips brace the bridge plug whose performance have a directly influence on the oil well productivity and production safety. In {{order to make sure}} that the bridge plug slips can meet the anchoring requirement, the actual working state of the slips system was analyzed by using finite element software, and the stress distribution rules were obtained. The results provide theoretical basis for optimizing slip structure and improving working reliability...|$|E
40|$|Montana, overall, is {{a surplus}} {{producing}} area of dairy products. Large amounts of butter and cheese are being {{shipped to the}} urban markets of other regions. Yet, many markets of the state {{do not have an}} adequate supply of quality milk to meet year around consumer demands. The deficit areas exist not because the overall production of the area is low, but because the type of production and marketing of milk does not permit the supply to be available to the non-producer. This problem has become increasingly acute the past decade, during which time a large shift in cow numbers has taken place from the plains region to the more favorable producing areas of the mountain region. This shift has been accentuated by favorable crop producing conditions and cityward migration of our population in the plains region. Feasible means to alleviate these shortages have not been accessible to the smaller markets until only recently. Today, {{with the advent of the}} <b>one-trip</b> paper carton and refrigerated truck, milk of high quality can be shipped to all areas of the state. No single marketing process has so completely revolutionized our milk industry as that of the paper carton. Significant determinations of this study includes (1) Milk production in Montana exhibits pronounced seasonal fluctuations. In 1948 milk production ranged from a low of 36 million pounds to a high of 7...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the following scenario. A point robot is placed at some start location in a 2 -dimensional scene containing oriented rectangular obstacles. The robot must repeatedly travel {{back and forth between}} and a second location in the scene. The robot knows the coordinates of and but initially knows nothing about the positions or sizes of the obstacles. It can only determine the obstacles ’ locations by bumping into them. We would like an intelligent strategy for the robot so that its trips between and both are relatively fast initially, and improve as more trips are taken and more information is gathered. In this paper we describe an algorithm for this problem with the following guarantee: in the first trips, the average distance per trip is at most times the length of the shortest- path in the scene, where is the Euclidean distance between and. We also show a matching lower bound for deterministic strategies. These results generalize known bounds on the <b>one-trip</b> problem. Our algorithm is based on a novel method for making an optimal tradeoff between search effort and the goodness of the path found. We improve this algorithm to a “smooth ” variant having the property that for every, the robot’s th trip length is times the shortest- path length. A key idea of this paper is a method for analyzing obstacle scenes using a tree structure that can be defined based on the positions of the obstacles. ...|$|E
40|$|Animal populations exhibiting partial {{migration}} {{present a}} fraction of the population which is migratory, while the other is resident, representing thus a unique opportunity to explore the causes of the general phenomenon of migration. In ungulate species showing high ecological plasticity, partial migration {{has been described as a}} complex phenomenon: the proportion of migrants, the timing of migration and the pattern of the migratory route was affected by environmental factors and density dependent regulation. The European roe deer Capreolus capreolus is particularly suited for such studies due to a wide distribution range and a high level of ecological plasticity. In this study we undertook a comparative analysis of roe deer GPS location data from a representative set of European ecosystems available within the EURODEER collaborative project. We aimed at evaluating the ecological factors affecting migration tactic (i. e. occurrence) and pattern (i. e. timing, residence time, number of migratory trips). Migration occurrence varied between and within populations and depended on winter severity and topographic variability. Spring migrations were highly synchronous, while the timing of autumn migrations varied widely between regions, individuals and sexes. Overall, roe deer were faithful to their summer ranges, especially males. In the absence of extreme and predictable winter conditions, roe deer seemed to migrate opportunistically, in response to a tradeoff between the advantages to exploit spatially separated ranges and the costs of migratory movements. Animals performed numerous trips between winter and summer ranges which depended on factors influencing the costs of movement such as between-range distance, slope and habitat openness. Our results support the idea that migration encompasses a behavioural continuum, with <b>one-trip</b> migration and residence as its end points, while commuting and multi-trip migration with short residence times in seasonal ranges are intermediate tactics. We believe that a full understanding of the variation in tactics of temporal separation in habitat use will provide important insights on migration and the factors that influence its prevalenc...|$|E
40|$|The {{oilfield}} {{service industry}} is currently exposed to strong competition. In order to remain competitive, oilfield service companies {{are dependent on}} streamlined operations, which {{can be achieved by}} e. g. developing and applying new and more efficient products and technologies. Baker Hughes, a United States oilfield service company among the largest in the world, is now at the final stage of developing a new drilling system called the <b>One-Trip</b> System (OTS), which is to be tested operationally in the summer of 2017. The Norwegian department of the company is the first in Baker Hughes' organization to incorporate the new system. Based on experience, the implementation of new products is a challenging process within the company and the industry. Increasing the likelihood of successful integration of the new system into the organization is thus desirable. There {{is a great deal of}} literature that examines the importance and application of critical success factors in projects. Studies show that there are some specific factors that, if followed by the project and its stakeholders, may increase the likelihood of a successful project. Some studies focus on success factors for projects in general, while others look at specific project types, such as product development, IT and implementation projects. This study aims to determine the critical success factors for the integration of new tools and equipment in oilfield service companies, which may aid the integration of the OTS within the Norwegian department of Baker Hughes. The critical success factors are mapped using a mixed method where findings from case-projects are compared with findings from relevant literature. All the presented case-projects have similar features as the OTS project, as they all relate to the integration and implementation of new products. Based on the findings from the case-projects, a set of critical success factors for the integration of new tools and equipment in the oil service industry is proposed and presented. These success factors are analyzed and compared with findings from the literature study. It appears that the findings from the case-projects are supported by literature on success factors within projects, project implementation and change management, which increases the validity and generality of the research. The final list of critical success factors is presented below. - Capable and experienced project manager - Dedicated and committed project manager - KPIs must support and reward use of new technology - Upper management support and trust - Early and continuous involvement of end-user - Openness - Communication - Training of end-use...|$|E
