5|$|Following the Dutch defeat, Queen Wilhelmina {{established}} a government-in-exile in England. The German occupation officially began on 17 May 1940. It would be {{five years before}} the entire country was liberated, during which time over 210,000 inhabitants of the Netherlands became victims of war, among them 104,000 Jews and other minorities, victims of genocide. Another 70,000 more may have died from indirect consequences, such as poor nutrition <b>or</b> <b>limited</b> medical services.|$|E

5|$|Strength {{testing of}} these muscles can be {{measured}} during a neurological examination to assess function of the spinal accessory nerve. Poor strength <b>or</b> <b>limited</b> movement are suggestive of damage, which can result {{from a variety of}} causes. Injury to the spinal accessory nerve is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve the head and neck. Injury can cause wasting of the shoulder muscles, winging of the scapula, and weakness of shoulder abduction and external rotation.|$|E
5|$|In {{their work}} Pleasure Able: Sexual Device Manual for Persons with Disabilities, authors Kate Naphtali and Edith MacHattie of the Disabilities Health Research Network under the {{supervision}} of doctors Andrei Krassioukov and Stacy L Elliott recommended use of the Magic Wand in sexual activity for people with disabilities. The authors said the person holding the device would need to be capable of maintaining an active wide grasp throughout the process. They wrote that the Magic Wand was helpful for disabled people with either limited strength in their upper extremities <b>or</b> <b>limited</b> use of their hands. They also said it was well-suited for individuals with decreased movement in their upper extremities.|$|E

5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, <b>or</b> <b>limited</b> carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells. The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen, albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} of bog turtles between colonies facilitates genetic diversity. If this movement {{were to be}} prevented, <b>or</b> <b>limited</b> in any significant way, the species would have a higher likelihood of becoming extinct because genetic diversity would fall. Some aspects of a bog turtle's movement that remain unresolved include: phenomena that motivate bog turtles to move outside their natural habitat; the distances an individual {{can be expected to}} travel each day, week, and year; and how separation of small groups affects the genetics of the species.|$|E
5|$|Menem {{began his}} {{presidency}} assuming a non-confrontational approach, and appointing {{people from the}} conservative opposition, and business people to his cabinet. To prevent successful legal cases against the projected privatizations, the Supreme Court's numbers were increased from five to nine judges; the new judges ruled in support of Menem and usually had the majority. Other institutions that restrained <b>or</b> <b>limited</b> executive power were controlled as well. When Congress resisted some of his proposals, he used the Necessity and Urgency Decree {{as an alternative to}} send bills to it. He even considered it feasible to dissolve Congress and rule by decree, but this step was never implemented. In addition, he developed a bon vivant lifestyle, taking advantage of his authority. For instance, he made a journey from Buenos Aires to Pinamar driving a Ferrari Testarossa in less than two hours, violating speed limits. He divorced his wife Zulema Yoma and expanded the Quinta de Olivos presidential residence with a golf course, a small zoo, servants, barber, and even a buffoon.|$|E

5|$|The N.W.O.B.H.M. Encyclopedia by Malc Macmillan lists {{more than}} 500 {{recording}} bands {{established in the}} decade between 1975 and 1985 and related to the movement. Probably as many bands launched in the same period, but never emerged from their local club scene, or recorded nothing more than demo tapes <b>or</b> <b>limited</b> pressings of self-produced singles. The disinterest of record labels, poor management of bands, internal struggles and musical choices that turned off much of their original fan base, resulted in most groups disbanding and disappearing {{by the end of}} the decade. A few of the best known groups, such as Praying Mantis in Japan and Saxon, Demon and Tokyo Blade in mainland Europe, survived in foreign markets. Some others, namely Raven, Girlschool and Grim Reaper, tried to break through in the US market signing with American labels, but their attempts were unsuccessful. Two of the more popular bands of the movement, however, went on to considerable, lasting success. Iron Maiden has since become one of the most commercially successful and influential heavy metal bands of all time, even after adopting a more progressive style. Def Leppard became even more successful, targeting the American mainstream rock market with their more refined hard rock sound.|$|E
