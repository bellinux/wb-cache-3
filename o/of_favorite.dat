5|$|As {{the series}} progressed, some critics began to express {{frustration}} with the comic. Joey Smith, also with Inside Pulse, found the large cast was difficult to track by the fourth issue. In a review of issue 33, Fulton found the series entertaining, but sometimes thought the plot felt directionless. Not all agreed, however; Paste Magazine included the comic book in its list <b>of</b> <b>favorite</b> horror comics in late 2016.|$|E

Nagisa is a shy, soft-spoken girl who has very low {{self-esteem}} and self-confidence which causes her to rely on those around her for support. She has developed the strange habit of muttering the names <b>of</b> <b>favorite</b> foods that she plans to eat as a way to motivate herself, such as anpan.

5|$|Thrown into further {{confusion}} by {{the loss}} <b>of</b> <b>Favorite,</b> the French and Venetian formation began to break up and the British squadron was able to pull ahead of their opponents; the leading French ships Flore and Bellona succeeded in only reaching Amphion, which was now {{at the rear of}} the British line. Amphion found herself caught between the two frigates and this slowed the British line enough that the French eastern division, led by Danaé, was able to strike at HMS Volage, now the leading British ship after overtaking Cerberus during the turn. Volage was much smaller than her opponent but was armed with 32-pounder carronades, short range guns that caused such damage to Danaé that the French ship was forced to haul off and reengage from a longer range. The strain of combat at this greater distance ruptured Volage's short-ranged carronades and left the ship much weakened, with only a single gun with which to engage the enemy.|$|E

There are two major purposes for grafting in bonsai. First, a number <b>of</b> <b>favorite</b> species do not thrive as bonsai on their natural root stock and their trunks are often grafted onto hardier root stock. Examples include Japanese red maple and Japanese black pine. Second, grafting allows the bonsai artist to add branches (and sometimes roots) where they are needed to improve or complete a bonsai design. There are many applicable grafting techniques, none unique to bonsai, including branch grafting, bud grafting, thread grafting, and others.|$|E

He also used mythological images with a strong sense of purpose; some of his religious paintings are among his greatest.|$|E
