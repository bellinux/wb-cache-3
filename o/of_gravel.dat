5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the routing through Muskegon was altered. Instead of {{terminating}} in {{the park}} at the outlet of Muskegon Lake into Lake Michigan, M-46 was routed to follow US16 to the car ferry docks. The last section <b>of</b> <b>gravel</b> highway was also paved in Newaygo County near the Montcalm County line. The routing of M-46 between Casnovia and Howard City was altered in 1973 when the US131 freeway was opened north of Cedar Springs by then-Congressman Gerald R. Ford. M-46 was restored to the Kent City–Cedar Springs roadway it used in the 1930s and routed concurrently along US131 again.|$|E
5|$|The {{section of}} Highway401 between Windsor and London {{has often been}} {{referred}} to as Carnage Alley, in reference to the numerous crashes that have occurred throughout its history. The term became more commonplace following several deadly pileups during the 1990s. The narrow and open grass median was an ineffective obstacle in preventing cross-median collisions. The soft shoulders consisted <b>of</b> <b>gravel</b> with a sharp slope which was blamed for facilitating vehicle rollovers.|$|E
5|$|When US-62 first {{appeared}} on the state highway map in 1930, it had the same basic routing as it did today. In 1930, most of the highway was <b>of</b> <b>gravel</b> or earthen construction. The only portions of the highway that were paved were from Chickasha to Tabler, from Newcastle to Oklahoma City and Meeker, from Okemah to Morris, and from {{just south of the}} US-64 junction to Fort Gibson. By 1948, the entire stretch of US-62 through Oklahoma had been paved.|$|E

5|$|After a {{bill that}} would have {{provided}} funds to protect the site failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a levee around the site to protect it from the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers <b>of</b> <b>gravel</b> that had not been accounted for. However, as the site was being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes of being able to return to the dig in the future.|$|E
5|$|By 2001 NFF was in {{the process}} of {{implementing}} new stadium requirements in the top leagues, and Briskeby would no longer be permitted to be used in the top tier. Ham-Kam entered an alliance with Totalprosjekt—an real estate development company working on Lillestrøm's Åråsen Stadion—who presented a concept to finance a new venue: The municipality would transfer property to a limited company jointly owned by the municipality and the major sports clubs, the real estate would be re-regulated to increase their value, and the company would use this capital to build a new professional and a new recreational stadium. Parallel with this, a municipal commission made a report that recommended a consolidation in the number of venues in town and the conversion <b>of</b> <b>gravel</b> and grass fields to artificial turf. The commission recommended that a new professional football venue be built either at Briskeby or Hamar stadion.|$|E
5|$|Ismael {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} {{further to the}} north, peaking at 10.9inches (276mm) in Sonora. Severe flooding was reported in Huatabampo. The hurricane directly affected 24,111people in 8 municipalities. Throughout Sonora, the strong winds destroyed 4,728 houses and removed the roofs of 6,827 homes. The hurricane also destroyed 107 schools and 2 health centers in the state. The passage of Hurricane Ismael damaged high-tension power lines and cable lines, causing interruptions to the communication system. The hurricane also weakened 2,163miles (3,481km) <b>of</b> <b>gravel</b> roads and damaged about 100miles (165km) of paved highways. 250people lost their jobs in Sonora due to sunken or damaged fishing boats.

5|$|Lafarge Aggregates owns various {{sites in}} the parish. In 1974 the village won an appeal against Pioneer Concrete's {{application}} for gravel extraction near the village. Similar events took place in March 2003 when hundreds of local residents protested against an application <b>of</b> <b>gravel</b> extraction by Lafarge. Larfarge's initial appeal, in April 2003, was turned down by West Berkshire Council. A further application to extract aggregate at the Wasing Estate was due to be decided in 2010. One former extraction site, Butts Lake Quarry, is now a nature reserve and the flooded lakes {{have been identified as}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is now operated by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve contains specimens of trees such as alder, cherry, hawthorn, oak, and willow. Examples of reeds present include typha latifolia, phragmites australis, mentha aquatica, and lythrum salicaria. Numerous species of bird nest in the reserve, including the common teal, shoveler, warbler, kingfisher, water rail, and nightingale.|$|E
5|$|Over $200,000 {{was spent}} on renovations {{in the fall and}} winter before the 1995 season. The home clubhouse and weight room were remodeled, aisles behind the dugouts were resurfaced to reduce {{slippery}} areas, and the entire playing field was re-sodded. This was the first replacement and upgrading of the field since the original sod was laid in 1978. First, all of the old grass was stripped from the field. Then, the grounds crew installed a new drainage system. Four trenches were dug and laid with 2,500feet (760m) of drainage pipe to carry water away from the field and beyond the center field wall. A layer <b>of</b> <b>gravel</b> was laid over the pipe, and a 4-to-6-inch (10to15cm) layer of sand was placed above the gravel. After raising the level of the infield dirt and brick warning track to the same height of the new field, 100,000square feet (9,300m²) of Tifton 419 Bermuda Grass was installed on the field and edged into a baseball diamond configuration.|$|E
5|$|Since 1966, over 630,000 men, 100,000 tons of foodstuffs, 400,000 weapons, and 50,000 tons of {{ammunition}} had traveled {{through the maze}} <b>of</b> <b>gravel</b> and dirt roads, paths, and river transportation systems that crisscrossed southeastern Laos. The trail also linked up with a similar logistical system in neighboring Cambodia known as the Sihanouk Trail. However, following the overthrow of Prince Norodom Sihanouk in 1970, the pro-American Lon Nol regime had denied {{the use of the}} port of Sihanoukville to communist shipping. Strategically, this was an enormous blow to the North Vietnamese effort, since 70 percent of all military supplies that supported its effort in the far south had moved through the port. A further blow to the logistical system in Cambodia had come {{in the spring and summer}} of 1970, when U.S. and ARVN forces had crossed the border and attacked PAVN/NLF Base Areas during the Cambodian Campaign.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Through the {{experimental}} analysis on {{performance of the}} water permeability and conservation and the shear resistance <b>of</b> graded <b>gravel</b> base, the influencing factors and changing rules, {{as well as the}} internal relations of the drainage ability and structural performance are found out; the key factor for balancing the contradiction lies in the scope and content of the fine aggregates <b>of</b> graded <b>gravel.</b> Provided that other constraint conditions are met during the gradation design, good water permeability and conservation performance <b>of</b> graded <b>gravel</b> permeable base shall be guaranteed as long as the content of the fine aggregates <b>of</b> graded <b>gravel</b> could be controlled within a reasonable scope, meanwhile, the mechanical stability could also be ensured.

5|$|The Inland Empire Highway was {{originally}} a collection <b>of</b> <b>gravel</b> county roads that have existed since 1898 in the Spokane area and 1905 in the Pullman area. The highway {{was added to}} the state highway system in 1913, traveling within the Palouse region between Colfax and Spokane. The Second Division of the Eastern Route of the Inland Empire Highway was also established in 1913, traveling northwest from Sampson Trail Y at the IdahoWashington state line to Pullman. The Idaho portion of US195 became part of the North and South Highway in 1916 and was not numbered under Idaho's state highway system in 1953. The gap in the Second Division between Pullman and Colfax was named by Whitman County as a highway of importance the following year and was not built until 1925 as part of State Road3.|$|E
5|$|The {{entirety}} of old Route6-a between West Junius and Halsey Corners {{was assigned a}} designation {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. From West Junius to Magee, the highway was designated as NY291; meanwhile, the section from Magee to Halsey Corners became part of NY89, which originally continued north from Magee to North Rose on what is now NY414. At the same time, Black Brook Road, a connector between the village of Seneca Falls and NY89 east of Magee, was assigned NY390. In the mid-1930s, the portion <b>of</b> <b>Gravel</b> Road between US20 and NY5 and NY89 was designated as NY390A. The route was a spur route of NY390 in name only as NY390A never connected to NY390. The NY291 designation was deleted in the early 1940s.|$|E
5|$|The first {{segments}} of {{road in the}} location of what would become FM 1528 existed by the year of 1936. On September 26, 1939, a portion of road traveling from SH 24 to the community of Klondike was designated as Spur Highway 39 (Spur 39). and on September 28, 1949, through {{the order of the}} Texas Transportation Board, FM 1528 was designated, and Spur 39 was redesignated as part of the highway. In 1961, the highway had a bituminous surface, a combination <b>of</b> <b>gravel</b> and asphalt. By 1987, the highway had been minorly rerouted and straightened, and the entire length had been paved. Between 1986 and 1991, the highway's route was minorly rerouted between Klondike and Cooper, due to the construction of Cooper Lake.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} along {{a series of}} roads between Appleton and Minneapolis around 1933. At first these roads were a mixture <b>of</b> <b>gravel</b> and bitumen surfaces, the latter a forerunner of today's asphalt. Within the first year or so, the western end was extended to terminate MN7 in the Ortonville area. In 1958, the highway was extended to its modern western terminus at Beardsley by replacing another trunk highway. The section that is now an expressway in the Twin Cities was expanded by the 1950s, and the whole highway was paved in a hard-surface {{by the end of}} that decade. The highway was truncated in the Twin Cities to its current eastern terminus in the 1980s. The scenic byways designations were applied at the state and federal levels in 1995 and 2002, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{tax system}} was {{partially}} reformed in 1881, allowing for direct payment of road taxes instead of relying totally on the statute-labor system. The first road district {{larger than the}} township level was created in Bay County in 1883 under Public Act278. This road district encompassed eight townships and provided for better coordination and planning of road construction. Other county systems were created in 1893 with passage of legislation which allowed other counties to {{follow the lead of}} Bay County. By 1900, the plank roads were generally abandoned. While a few were still in good repair, most consisted of rotting logs with intermittent patches <b>of</b> <b>gravel.</b> Toll houses were empty shacks, and the ditches were clogged with duck ponds. Only 23 of the original 202plank roads chartered by the state were still in operation.|$|E
5|$|There {{are about}} 30 ponds in the park. Some– {{including}} Barn Wood Pond, Bishop's Pond, Gallows Pond, Leg of Mutton Pond, Martin's Pond and White Ash Pond– {{have been created}} to drain the land or to provide water for livestock. The Pen Ponds (which in the past were used to rear carp for food) date from 1746. They were formed when a trench was dug in the early 17th century to drain a boggy area; later in that century this was widened and deepened by the extraction <b>of</b> <b>gravel</b> for local building. The Ponds now take in water from streams flowing from the higher ground around them and release it to Beverley Brook. Beverley Brook and the two Pen Ponds are most visible areas {{of water in the}} park.|$|E

5|$|In 1908 Reading Central Goods {{railway station}} was {{opened on the}} Coley branch line {{diverting}} at Southcote Junction. During the first few decades of the 20th century, however, most of Southcote remained rural and undeveloped. An Ordnance Survey map of 1914 shows the majority of land as agricultural (farms and nurseries) with a number <b>of</b> <b>gravel</b> pits and smithies. The 1930s saw {{the construction of the}} Southcote Park Estate, a housing estate built on land inherited after the death of William Berkeley Monck of Coley Park. An Ordnance Survey map of 1938 shows greater provision for the population (as opposed to industry); some of the gravel pits no longer existed and Presentation College, a boys' school, had opened in two large Victorian buildings—Rotherfield Grange and Oakland Hall, the latter a suburban villa built in the 1870s. By the advent of World War II, Southcote had begun to experience urban sprawl from Reading and the land bordering the Great Western Railway had begun to be used for housing. Following the war, Denton's Field on the Bath Road in Southcote was used for celebratory events; Battle of Britain commemorative fêtes were held in September 1949 and 1950, and featured a performance by three Alsatians—Rocky, Lindy and Irma—to recognise their work in the war. Denton's Field gained reputation as a location for outdoor community events, and was comparable to places such as Caversham Park and Palmer Park.|$|E
