True to Jack's word, Captain John is lying and seizes the containers, trying to kill Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) using a paralyzing lip gloss, shooting Owen Harper (Burn Gorman), punching Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) and pushing Jack <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a building, thinking he's dead. However the containers, which are supposed to contain {{the location of a}} valuable diamond hidden by the lover he murdered, instead contain an explosive which latches on the DNA signature of her killer.

5|$|In November Cochet only {{competed in}} the Toussaint tournament, held at the Tennis Club de Paris, {{alongside}} Colette Rosambert with whom he lost to Jean Borotra and his more skilled female partner Helen Wills Moody. The year 1932 {{marked the first time}} Cochet slipped <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the charts after switching places with Vines. In June 1933 Cochet, seeded first, relinquished his French Championships title to Australian Jack Crawford, who overwhelmed him in the final in three straight sets, becoming the first non-French player to possess it. In July the French team lost the Davis Cup {{for the first time since}} 1927. In front of their home crowd on the clay courts of Roland Garros, but without Lacoste and Borotra, the French team lost 3â€“2 to Great Britain. Cochet was defeated by Fred Perry and won against Bunny Austin, both in five sets. At the 1933 Wimbledon Championships first-seeded Vines conquered Cochet, who was seeded third, in straight sets in the semifinal. It was the third time in a row that Vines beat Cochet. These events marked the end of the Four Musketeers era.|$|E
5|$|Robert {{issued an}} appeal {{for help to}} his barons, and Henry {{was the first to}} arrive in Rouen in November.

Henry was angry that Conan had turned against his feudal lord. He had him taken to the top of Rouen Castle and then, despite Conan's offers to pay a huge ransom, threw him <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the castle to his death. Contemporaries considered Henry to have acted appropriately in making an example of Conan, and Henry became famous for his exploits in the battle.|$|E

Roseboro led <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the sixth inning with a home run to give the Dodgers a 3â€“2 lead.

Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment.|$|E
