The specimens were prepared using modified solvothermal synthesis to produce large (similar to 1 mm dimension) crystals. In the case of the clathrasil dodecasil- 3 C the material undergoes a first-order phase transition at similar to 433 K that is reversible after heating to 873 K and cooling to room temperature. Comparison with powder X-ray diffraction data from a bulk sample shows that this is a ferroelastic tetragonal (I (4) over bar 2 d) to cubic (Fd (3) over barm) transition, which is supported by the functional form of temperature variation of the birefringence. There is apparently no loss of the <b>organic</b> <b>template</b> involved in this transition. For the zeolite ferrierite, the plate-like crystals show a pronounced domain-like structure, which, although not due to twinning, shows a distinctive optical birefringence change on heating, suggesting that variable concentrations of <b>organic</b> <b>template</b> might be present in different domain-like regions. In this material there is no evidence for a change in crystal symmetry up to 873 K (Pnnm), despite apparent loss of some <b>organic</b> <b>template</b> from the material which, in turn, gives rise to strain birefringence at the edges parallel to the [010] direction. ...|$|E
40|$|Nanocrystalline ZSM- 5 zeolite, {{which is}} a {{well-known}} catalyst used {{in a variety of}} applications in industry, environment, and medicine, can be synthesized using different methods. However, a big challenge in synthesizing nanocrsytalline ZSM- 5 is the use of an <b>organic</b> <b>template</b> such as TPAOH, which is very expensive. The template is required to facilitate the growth of the nanocrsytalline ZSM- 5 during the synthesis. However, to use the nanocrsytalline ZSM- 5, the template has to be removed by a calcination process to open the pores and reveal the active surface of the nanocrystalline ZSM- 5. The calcination process requires a high temperature {{for a long time to}} remove the <b>organic</b> <b>template.</b> Consequently, synthesizing nanocrystalline ZSM- 5 by using a templated method is considered to be time, energy, and materials inefficient.

40|$|In {{this work}} a direct {{activation}} route of zeolites is assessed. It consists of NH 4 -exchanging the as-synthesized solids before removing the <b>organic</b> <b>template.</b> Calcination afterwards serves to combust the <b>organic</b> <b>template</b> and creates the Bronsted sites directly; thus applying merely a single thermal step. This method simplifies their activation {{and the material}} suffers less thermal stress. The approach was particularly effective for microcrystalline beta and ferrierite zeolites. Thorough investigation of the template content and materials' texture points out to three relevant effects that can explain the effective exchange process: partial removal of the template during exchange creates substantial microporosity (ferrierite), the remaining template is reorganized within the pores (ferrierite) and finally, void space can exist due to the non-perfect matching between the network and template (beta). This shorter method appears suited for microcrystalline zeolites; it was ineffective for crystalline MFI types. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of sustainable and environmentally friendly techniques for synthesizing zeolites has attracted much attention, {{as the use}} of <b>organic</b> <b>templates</b> and solvents in the hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites is a major obstacle for realizing green and sustainable synthesis ways. Recently, the introduction of the organotemplate-free synthesis method allowed avoiding the use of <b>organic</b> <b>templates,</b> but water as solvent was still required; solvent-free routes on the other hand beared the potential to significantly reduce the amount of polluted wastewater, but <b>organic</b> <b>templates</b> were still present. In this work, we have demonstrated a combined strategy of both organotemplate- and solvent-free conditions to synthesize aluminosilicate zeolites Beta and ZSM- 5 (S-Beta and S-ZSM- 5), two of the most important zeolites relevant for industry. The samples are thoroughly characterized by XRD patterns, SEM images, N- 2 sorption isotherms, UV-Raman spectra, and Si- 29 and Al- 27 MAS NMR spectra. The results demonstrate that S-Beta and S-ZSM- 5 zeolites exhibit almost the same textural parameters (e. g., BET surface area and pore volume) and catalytic performance in cumene cracking and m-xylene isomerization as those of conventional Beta and ZSM- 5 zeolites synthesized under hydrothermal conditions (C-Beta and C-ZSM- 5). The organotemplate- and solvent-free syntheses of S-Beta and S-ZSM- 5 take place at a low-pressure regime and are free of harmful gases as well as give high product yields together with highly efficient consumption of the starting raw materials. These advantages plus the very simple procedures opened the pathway to a highly sustainable zeolite synthesis protocol compared to conventional methods currently employed for C-Beta and C-ZSM- 5. Very interestingly, this simple synthesis is a good model for understanding zeolite crystallization. The detail characterizations indicate that the S-Beta crystals are formed from the assembly of zeolite building units, mainly 4 MRs, while the SMRs in the framework are just formed in the crystallization of S-ZSM- 5, rather than existence in the starting solid mixture.

Prepared from a nanocrystal suspension containing residual amorphous silica, these films hold mechanical properties superior to other organosilicate low-k candidates. In this study, we have systematically synthesized these zeolite films with different crystallization times {{in order to}} alter the proportion of zeolite nanocrystals to residual amorphous silica. An extended characterization of these films shows a trade-off, which is crystallization-time dependant, between the pore size and the dielectric constant. We demonstrate that ultraviolet-assisted curing moderates this trade-off by enhancing the cross-linking of the matrix and, most importantly, by minimizing the hydrophilicity of the films. However, this synthesis approach provides no optimal solution to obtain the necessary pore size and dielectric constant. In addition, we present further evidences that this approach is intrinsically limited to fulfill all the requirements for low-k materials. For example, synthesized films lack homogeneity at a length scale of few tens of nanometers and the achieved roughness {{is comparable to the}} interconnect feature sizes. We propose a different strategy that exploits advantages of these zeolite films such as high porosity and stiffness but overcomes their intrinsic limitations. It consists of a sol-gel process with tetraalkoxysilanes and alkyltrialkoxysilanes in presence of <b>organic</b> <b>templates</b> commonly used in zeolite synthesis. Variation of synthesis media (acidic or basic) and flexibility in choice of zeolite <b>organic</b> <b>templates</b> allows a fine tuning of the desired properties.
