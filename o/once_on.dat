5|$|Although The Covent-Garden Tragedy {{appeared}} with The Old Debauchees, {{it was not}} a success like the other play and quickly dropped.

After all, the plot focuses on a love triangle between characters in a brothel. Even though the first night fell apart, the play was later performed; it eventually appeared again for four nights with Don Quixote in England, <b>once</b> <b>on</b> its own in 1734, and a few later times during the 18th century, including as a puppet show.|$|E

5|$|Dunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, {{went to work}} at <b>once</b> <b>on</b> {{the task}} of reform. He had to re-create monastic life and to rebuild the abbey.
