5|$|Alfred Hitchcock made a low-budget biographical film of Strauss in 1933 called Waltzes from Vienna. After {{a trip to}} Vienna, Walt Disney was {{inspired}} to create four feature films. One of those was The Waltz King, a loosely adapted biopic of Johann Strauss, which aired {{as part of the}} Wonderful World <b>of</b> <b>Disney</b> in the U.S. in 1963. In Mikhail Bulgakov's 1940 (published 1967) novel, The Master and Margarita, Johann Strauss conducts the orchestra during Satan's Great Ball at the invitation of Behemoth.|$|E

5|$|Previously, feature {{animation}} satellite studios {{were located}} {{around the world}} in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France (a suburb of Paris), and in Bay Lake, Florida (near Orlando, at Disney's Hollywood Studios, one of the four theme parks at Walt Disney World). The Paris studio was shut down in 2002, while the Florida studio was shut down in 2004. The Florida animation building survives as an office building, while the former Magic <b>of</b> <b>Disney</b> Animation section of the building is home to Star Wars Launch Bay.|$|E
5|$|The Black Cauldron was {{intended}} to expand the appeal <b>of</b> <b>Disney</b> animated films to older audiences and to showcase the talents of the new generation <b>of</b> <b>Disney</b> animators from CalArts. Besides Keane, Musker, and Clements, this new group of artists included other promising animators such as Andreas Deja, Mike Gabriel, John Lasseter, and Tim Burton. Lasseter was fired from Disney in 1983 for pushing the studio to explore computer animation production, but {{went on to become}} the creative head of Pixar, a pioneering computer animation studio that would begin a close association with Disney in the late 1980s. Similarly, Burton was fired in 1984 after producing a live-action short shelved by the studio, Frankenweenie, then went on to become a high-profile producer and director of live-action and stop-motion features for Disney and other studios. Some of Burton's high-profile projects for Disney would include the stop-motion The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), a live-action adaptation of Alice in Wonderland (2010), and a stop-motion feature remake of Frankenweenie (2012).|$|E

5|$|Walt Disney Productions {{purchased}} the film rights to Gary K. Wolf's novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit? shortly after its publication in 1981. Ron W. Miller, then president <b>of</b> <b>Disney,</b> {{saw it as}} a perfect opportunity to produce a blockbuster. Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were hired to write the script, penning two drafts. Robert Zemeckis offered his services as director in 1982, but Disney declined as his two previous films (I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Used Cars) had been box office bombs. Between 1981 and 1983 Disney developed test footage with Darrell Van Citters as animation director, Paul Reubens voicing Roger Rabbit, Peter Renaday as Eddie Valiant, and Russi Taylor as Jessica Rabbit. The project was revamped in 1985 by Michael Eisner, the then-new CEO <b>of</b> <b>Disney.</b> Amblin Entertainment, which consisted of Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, were approached to produce Who Framed Roger Rabbit alongside Disney. The original budget was projected at $50 million, which Disney felt was too expensive.|$|E
5|$|Aladdin, {{released}} in November 1992, continued the upward trend in Disney's animation success, earning $504 million worldwide {{at the box}} office, and two more Oscars for Best Song and Best Score. Featuring songs by Menken, Ashman, and Tim Rice (who replaced Ashman after his passing) and starring the voice of Robin Williams, Aladdin also established the trend of hiring celebrity actors and actresses to provide the voices <b>of</b> <b>Disney</b> characters, which had been explored to some degree with The Jungle Book and Oliver & Company, but now became standard practice.|$|E

His next film was the 2000 television film Geppetto, which debuted on The Wonderful World <b>of</b> <b>Disney.</b> The film, an adaptation of Pinocchio, included actor Wayne Brady, who had joined Carey on his improv shows. Carey took singing lessons {{to prepare for the}} role. In 2005, Carey appeared in three films: the animated film Robots, where he provided a voice-over for the character Crank; The Aristocrats, where he retold a dirty joke along with other celebrities; and the documentary Fuck, where he was interviewed.|$|E
5|$|Disney had {{originally}} conceived Mulan as an oppressed young Chinese woman who ultimately elopes to Europe {{to be with}} a British prince. However, director Tony Bancroft, who was inspired by the well-being of his own daughters, wanted Mulan to be a different, unique kind <b>of</b> <b>Disney</b> heroine – one who is strong and independent, whose fate does not depend upon a male character. Thus, the relationship between Mulan and Captain Li Shang was relegated to that of a minor subplot, while Mulan's bravery and strength were emphasized {{in order to ensure that}} she remained the hero of her own story. Mulan's supervising animator was Mark Henn, who deliberately designed the character so that she would appear less feminine than her predecessors.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, after {{disagreements}} between Disney's Michael Eisner and Pixar's Steve Jobs {{over the}} distribution of Pixar's films, Disney announced {{that they would be}} creating a new animation studio, Circle 7 Animation, to make sequels to the seven Disney-owned Pixar films (which consisted of the films released between 1995 and 2006). The studio had put Toy Story 3 and Monsters University into development, and had hired screenwriter Laurie Craig to write a draft for Finding Dory. Circle 7 was subsequently shut down after Robert Iger replaced Eisner as CEO <b>of</b> <b>Disney</b> and arranged the acquisition of Pixar.|$|E

Jobs' new Disney holdings exceeded holdings belonging to ex-CEO Michael Eisner, the previous top shareholder, who still held 1.7%; and Disney Director Emeritus Roy E. Disney, who held almost 1% of the corporation's shares. Pixar shareholders received 2.3 shares <b>of</b> <b>Disney</b> common stock for each share of Pixar common stock redeemed.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts is {{the first}} game in the series, {{released}} in Japan on March 28, 2002 for PlayStation 2. Tetsuya Nomura has served as game director, his first time in this position.

It also established the role <b>of</b> <b>Disney</b> characters in the series, with character cameos from the Final Fantasy series. Kingdom Hearts was released in North America on September 17, 2002, and featured additional content that {{was not in the}} original Japanese version. The game was later re-released exclusively in Japan as Kingdom Hearts Final Mix on December 26, 2002. Final Mix includes the content from the North American release and additional enemies, cutscenes, and weapons.|$|E

The pilot aired as part of The Wonderful World <b>of</b> <b>Disney</b> series, with additional scripts being ordered and production contingent on the movie's reception. The series was passed at ABC, and UPN also passed following Lawson being cast on another series.|$|E
