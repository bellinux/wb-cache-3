25|$|Gadamer {{writes that}} human {{tradition}} and reason {{can serve as}} a standard of measure for testing uncovered truths and avoiding relativism. Heidegger states that we can avoid relativism by testing interpreted truths against Dasein's facticity, <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is already given in existence that informs our theorizing. Additionally, hermeneutic psychotherapists and theorists say that interpreted truths must be congruent with ontological hermeneutics theory.|$|E
25|$|Grief is a {{multifaceted}} response to loss, {{particularly to the}} loss of someone <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> has died, to which a bond or affection was formed. Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, bereavement refers to the state of loss, and grief is the reaction to that loss.|$|E
25|$|Resilience in {{children}} refers {{to individuals who}} are doing better than expected, given a history that includes risk or adverse experience. Once again, {{it is not a}} trait <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> some children simply possess. There {{is no such thing as}} an 'invulnerable child' that can overcome any obstacle or adversity that he or she encounters in life—and in fact, the trait is quite common. Resilience is the product of a large number of developmental processes over time, that has allowed children who experience some sort of risk to continue to develop competently (while other children do not).|$|E

25|$|Different {{strains of}} Triticeae exist for {{different}} industrial applications; durum for pasta and food pastes, {{two types of}} barley for beer, bread wheats used in different areas with different growing conditions. Replacing these motifs is not a plausible task since a contamination of 0.02% wheat in a gluten-free diet {{is considered to be}} pathogenic and would require replacing the motifs in all known regional varieties—potentially thousands of genetic modifications. Class I and antibody responses are downstream of Class II recognition and are of little remedial value in change. The innate response peptide could be a silver bullet, assuming there is only one of these per protein and only a few genome loci with the protein. Unresolved questions relevant to a complete understanding of immune responses to gluten are: Why is the rate of late onset gluten sensitivity rapidly rising? Is this truly a wheat problem, <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is being done to wheat, or to those who are eating wheat (for example, communicable diseases a trigger? Some individuals are susceptible by genetics (early onset), but many late onset cases could have different triggers because there is nothing genetically separating the 30 to 40% of people that could have Triticeae sensitivity from the ~1% that, in their lifetime, will have some level of this disease.|$|E
500|$|Gojira were {{acquired}} by Roadrunner Records and released L'Enfant Sauvage on 26 June 2012 on that label. The title translates to [...] "The Wild Child". Joe Duplantier explained that titling the album in English inadequately encapsulated {{the meaning of}} the French term: [...] "'Sauvage' is something that is not educated <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is like free and completely free in nature. A wild flower that goes wherever she wants and becomes something beautiful. The idea with [...] "L'Enfant Sauvage" [...] is like with a human that would grow up in nature, raised by wolves, for example, without the influence from others and the influence from institutions or society in general." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Spears revealed that her idea initially was to make an album that was [...] "fresh-sounding [...] for the clubs <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> you play in your car when you're going out at night that gets you excited, but I wanted it to sound different from everything else out right now." [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] is a party song with a heavy club beat. The elements used on the song's background were compared to similar used on songs by The Black Eyed Peas, Usher, Rihanna, and Lady Gaga, while its bass line {{was said to be}} [...] "a cousin of the ground" [...] for the Eurythmics' 1983 single [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)".|$|E

500|$|Rhodes {{gave him}} 48 hours {{to decide whether}} he wanted to join the new band that would [...] "rival the Pistols". Within 24 hours, Strummer agreed. Simonon later remarked, [...] "Once we had Joe on board it all started to come together." [...] Strummer {{introduced}} the band to his old school friend Pablo LaBritain, who sat in on drums during Strummer's first few rehearsals with the group. LaBritain's stint with the band {{did not last long}} (he subsequently joined 999), and Terry Chimes—whom Jones later referred to as [...] "one of the best drummers" [...] in their circle—became the band's regular drummer. In Westway to the World, Jones also says, [...] "I don't think Terry was officially hired or anything. He had just been playing with us." [...] Chimes did not take to Strummer at first: [...] "He was like twenty-two or twenty-three <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> seemed 'old' to me then. And he had these retro clothes and this croaky voice". Simonon came up with the band's name after they had briefly dubbed themselves the Weak Heartdrops and the Psychotic Negatives. He later explained the name's origin: [...] "It really came to my head when I started reading the newspapers and a word that kept recurring was the word 'clash', so I thought 'the Clash, what about that,' to the others. And they and Bernard, they went for it." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Poll" [...] was {{originally}} {{a name for}} the top of the head, and [...] "to poll" [...] was a verb meaning [...] "to crop the hair". This use was extended to similar treatment of the branches of trees and the horns of animals. A pollard simply meant someone <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> had been polled (similar to the formation of [...] "drunkard" [...] and [...] "sluggard"); for example, a hornless ox or polled livestock. Later, the noun pollard came {{to be used as a}} verb: [...] "pollarding". Pollarding has now largely replaced polling as the verb in the forestry sense. Pollard can also be used as an adjective: [...] "pollard tree".|$|E
2500|$|The term {{is related}} to Rādha (Sanskrit: राध), which means [...] "kindness, any gift but {{particularly}} the gift of affection, success, wealth". The word appears in the Vedic literature {{as well as the}} Epics, but is elusive and not as a major deity. In some Vedic contexts, states Sukumar Sen, it could mean [...] "beloved, desired woman" [...] based on an Avestan cognate. However, Barbara Stoller and other scholars disagree with the Avestan interpretation. They state that the better interpretation of Radha in these ancient texts is [...] "someone <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> fulfills a need". Starting with the Bhakti movement and particularly with Jayadeva's composition, her profile as a goddess and constant companion of Krishna became dominant in Krishna-related Vaishnavism.|$|E

2500|$|Lyrics {{based on}} {{personal}} experiences are another common feature of many gothic metal bands such as Anathema, Elis, Tiamat, Midnattsol and The Old Dead Tree. Graveworm moved away from fantasy stories in favor of personal lyrics after finding them more suitable for their style of music. The lyrics of fellow Italians Lacuna Coil also do not feature any [...] "fantasy stuff <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> you cannot find in reality" [...] as their co-vocalist Cristina Scabbia finds it desirable that people can relate themselves to her band's lyrics. Similarly, the band Lullacry features lyrics on the subjects of [...] "love, hate, passion and pain" [...] because a person [...] "can easily connect to a song" [...] with lyrics [...] "about human relationships".|$|E
2500|$|Jack Fiorito {{states that}} the {{organizing}} model and the servicing model cannot be considered separate and {{there needs to be}} provision for using both models at the same time; Fiorito's research about British union members showed that [...] "...a large number of responses express reservations about the OM or at least the organizing vs. servicing dichotomy suggested. Many of these responses emphasize the importance of service as an aid to organizing (18%) <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is expected by the members (23%)." [...] Fiorito believes that the organizing model and the servicing model are not mutually exclusive in some cases; there are some instances when the two models could be complementary. The debate over the organizing model versus the servicing model is widespread and multifaceted. Even the goals of the organizing model are debated and disagreed upon.|$|E
2500|$|Command {{hallucinations}} {{are sometimes}} used {{in defense of}} a crime, often homicides. In essence, it is a voice that one hears and it tells the listener what to do. Sometimes the commands are quite benign directives such as [...] "Stand up" [...] or [...] "Shut the door." [...] Whether it is a command for something simple <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is a threat, it is still considered a [...] "command hallucination." [...] Some helpful questions that can assist one in figuring out if he/she may be suffering from this include: [...] "What are the voices telling you to do?", [...] "When did your voices first start telling you to do things?", [...] "Do you recognize {{the person who is}} telling you to harm yourself (or others)?", [...] "Do you think you can resist doing what the voices are telling you to do?" ...|$|E
