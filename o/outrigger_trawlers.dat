25|$|<b>Outrigger</b> <b>trawlers</b> use {{outriggers}}, or booms, to tow the trawl. These outriggers {{are usually}} fastened to, {{or at the}} foot of the mast and extend out over the sides of the vessel during fishing operations. Each side can deploy a twin trawl or a single otter trawl. <b>Outrigger</b> <b>trawlers</b> may have the superstructure forward or aft. Warp winches with capstans are installed on the deck to haul the catch.|$|E
25|$|<b>Outrigger</b> <b>trawlers</b> with aft {{superstructure}} and midship {{working deck}} are usually beam trawlers (see below). These use large beams to rig the trawls.|$|E
25|$|<b>Outrigger</b> <b>trawlers</b> with {{a forward}} {{superstructure}} and aft working deck {{are widely used}} to target shrimp. The towing winch is usually located {{to the rear of}} the superstructure so warps from the drums feed to bollards on the cap rail, and then to towing blocks on the outriggers.|$|E
25|$|Beam {{trawlers}} are {{a type of}} <b>outrigger</b> <b>trawler</b> (above), {{with the}} superstructure aft and the working deck amidships. They use a very strong outrigger boom on each side, each towing a beam trawl, with the warps going through blocks {{at the end of}} the boom. This arrangement makes it easier to stow and handle the large beams. The outriggers are controlled from a midship A-frame or mast. The towing winch is forward of the superstructure, with the towing warps passed through deck bollards and then out to the towing blocks on the booms.|$|R
25|$|<b>Outrigger</b> <b>trawlers</b> â€“ use {{outriggers}} to tow the trawl. These {{are commonly}} used to catch shrimp. One or two otter trawls can be towed from each side. Beam trawlers, employed in the North sea for catching flatfish, are another form of outrigger trawler. Medium-sized and high powered vessels, these tow a beam trawl on each side at speeds up to 8 knots.|$|E
25|$|Otter {{trawlers}} {{usually have}} two gallows at the stern with towing blocks. The towing warps run through these, each regulated {{by its own}} winch. Medium and large trawlers usually have a stern ramp for hauling the trawl onto the deck. Some trawlers tow twin parallel trawls, using three warps, each warp with its own winch. Some otter trawlers are also <b>outrigger</b> <b>trawlers</b> (above), using outriggers to tow one or two otter trawls from each side.|$|E

40|$|Trawl net is a bag-shaped gear towed through water, {{the mouth}} of which is kept open either by a frame or beam or otter boards and floats or kites and sinkers or weight. Sometimes the opening is {{effected}} by dragging the net with two boats. According to the habitation of fish in sea, trawl net is operated either at the bottom or in the midwater. For fish living in the bottom, bottom trawls are operated. Shrimps, flatfish, sciaenids, ribbonfish, carangids, perches etc. are caught by bottom trawls. For catching pelagic fish such as sardine, silver belly, anchovies, ribbonfish, shallow water mix etc. midwater trawls can be used. In India there are 35, 000 mechanised boats most of which operate bottom trawl. Besides mechanised boats, there are 180 large vessels operated as <b>outrigger</b> <b>trawlers</b> for shrimp and stern trawlers for cuttle fish beyond territorial waters and offshore seas...|$|E
