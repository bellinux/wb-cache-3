5|$|In {{order to}} retain a {{consistent}} shape of the Stanley Cup, as there is only sufficient space for thirteen teams <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five lower bands, team names can only remain on the cup for 64 years. In 2005 the band for teams from 1941 to 1953 were removed and placed on display, thus Teeder Kennedy's name no longer appears on the Stanley Cup.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{official}} armament plan Kronan was to be equipped with 124–126guns; 34–36guns <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gundecks and an additional 18 shared between forecastle and sterncastle decks. Guns were classed {{by the weight of}} the cannonballs they fired, varying between 3 and 36pounds (1.3–15.3kg). The guns themselves weighed from a few hundred kg (400–500lbs) up to four tonnes (4.4 tons) with the heaviest pieces placed {{in the middle of the}} lower-most gundeck with successively lighter ones on the decks above. Kronans most lethal weapons were the 30- and 36-pounders on the lowest gundeck which had a range and firepower that outclassed the armament of almost any other warship. The guns lighter than 18-pounders were primarily intended to inflict damage on the enemy's crew and rigging rather than the hull.|$|E

These {{three days}} are {{commemorative}} {{of the three}} days in the year 1904 during which Aleister Crowley wrote the Book of the Law. One chapter was written each day, the first being written on April 8, the second on April 9, and the third on April 10. Although there is no official way of celebrating any Thelemic holiday, this particular feast day is usually celebrated by reading the corresponding chapter <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three days, usually at noon.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{deterioration}} of the wood of the exterior balconies over time, Queen RanavalonaII commissioned James Cameron to reinforce and encase the original structure in a stone shell in 1867. Cameron's exterior replaced the wooden balconies with stone walls three stories high. <b>On</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three floors, seven arched windows run the length of the two longer side walls while five windows illuminate the shorter front and back walls. A square tower stands at each of the four corners of the stone shell, extending above the level of the walls and forming their junction. A clock and bells were installed in the north-eastern tower.|$|E

The CM class is a powered passenger car. Class TTC is unpowered, it is equipped with a pantograph and a restaurant. The TT class is an unpowered passenger car which has also a pantograph on its roof. Each of the powered carriages is fitted with one motor <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two bogies. If needed, two trains can be coupled together.|$|E
5|$|East of {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} was a two-storey building with a basement. The basement was probably used for storage while the above two floors provided accommodation. The purpose of the buildings along {{the west end of}} the north range is uncertain. The sparse arrangement, with little provision for lighting, has led to suggestions that it was used as stables, however there are no drains which are usually associated with stables. The tower in the northwest corner of the castle had a garderobe and fireplace <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three above-ground floors, and there was a basement underneath.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} mounted <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> E-3's four engines {{provide the}} one megawatt of electrical {{power that is}} required by the E-3's radars and other electronics. Its pulse-Doppler radar (PD) has a range of more than 250mi (400km) for low-flying targets at its operating altitude, and the pulse (BTH) radar has a range of approximately 400mi (650km) for aircraft flying at medium to high altitudes. The radar, combined with an SSR, and electronic support measures (ESM), provides a look down capability, to detect, identify, and track low-flying aircraft, while eliminating ground clutter (radar) returns.|$|E

All platforms are signalled for trains in either direction and the flexible layout means that trains on any route can use {{any part of the}} station. Platforms with odd numbers are at the east end, even numbers at the west end (geographically the south, due to the curvature of the platforms).|$|E
5|$|Facilities at {{the station}} are minimal – there is a metal and glass shelter <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two islands {{as well as on}} the bridge.

5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany on November 1918, {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet, {{under the}} command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base of Scapa Flow. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha made clear to von Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and enlisted men <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital ships.|$|E

5|$|Illingworth took 4/92 in South Australia's first innings but was no-balled a {{total of}} three times by Egar and Ryan. Illingworth was called <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{occasions}} by the umpire standing at square leg. He was called twice by Egar on the second and fourth deliveries of his eleventh over, and once by Ryan on the sixth ball of his fourteenth over. In the same fourteenth over, Illingworth had dismissed former Pakistani Test batsman Duncan Sharpe and Australian Test wicket-keeper Barry Jarman from the first and fourth deliveries respectively. This broke a 97-run stand between Sharpe and Ian Chappell, before Jarman was removed for a duck. After 17 more runs were added, Illingworth had Chappell caught behind for 127.
