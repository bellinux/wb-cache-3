5|$|The {{circulation}} {{version of}} the Eisenhower dollar, the largest clad coin ever attempted by the Mint, was released through banks on November 1, 1971. Many were obtained by collectors; there was sufficient demand that many banks imposed a limit of one coin per customer. The clad pieces were struck from coinage strip purchased by the Mint from contractors. Many were not well-struck, causing collectors to search through rolls in search of better specimens. An <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> was found on {{a large number of}} specimens; this was removed by collectors.|$|E
25|$|The {{boundary}} layer shields and the <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> act as thermal insulation, {{leading to a}} low temperature of the lubricating film (maximum ~ on a water-cooled Wankel engine. This gives a more constant surface temperature. The temperature around the spark plug {{is about the same}} as the temperature in the combustion chamber of a reciprocating engine. With circumferential or axial flow cooling, the temperature difference remains tolerable.|$|E
25|$|UV {{detectors}} {{are sensitive}} to most fires, including hydrocarbons, metals, sulfur, hydrogen, hydrazine, and ammonia. Arc welding, electrical arcs, lightning, X-rays used in nondestructive metal testing equipment (though this is highly unlikely), and radioactive materials can produce levels that will activate a UV detection system. The presence of UV-absorbing gases and vapors will attenuate the UV radiation from a fire, adversely affecting {{the ability of the}} detector to detect flames. Likewise, the presence of an oil mist in the air or an <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> on the detector window will have the same effect.|$|E
40|$|The PETRO MAKS project "Formation and {{behaviour}} of thin <b>oil</b> <b>films</b> {{and evaluation of}} response methods including HSE", in the following short "Thin oil films" has the objective to achieve new knowledge more efficient and safe oil spill response operations for releases of condensates and light crude oils {{that may lead to}} thin <b>oil</b> <b>films</b> on the sea surface. Main objectives are: 1. lncreased understanding of the formation {{and behaviour}} of thin <b>oil</b> <b>films.</b> 2. Assessment of the potential human exposure to volatile compounds 3. Refined processes in oil trajectory models in order to give more reliable predictions of the life time and behaviour of thin <b>oil</b> <b>films</b> and to assess the efficacy of response options. This report addresses objective 3. and summarizes the results of three pre-studies on important processes for modelling of (thin) surface oil. We discuss model improvements and conclude with a proposal for concrete changes in the OSCAR model to better address behaviour and lifetime of thin films in the model...|$|R
40|$|A {{dielectric}} barrier discharge (DBD) {{powered by}} pulsed sinusoidal voltage at atmospheric pressure {{was used for}} the removal of thin <b>oil</b> <b>films.</b> Using pulsed power with suitably chosen pulse and pause duration, the oil removal rate, obtained here by the film thickness differences and the total local treatment time, can be significantly enhanced when compared to the continuous excitation. At pulse lengths of 120 µs and pause lengths of 1200 µs, the removal rate is approximately 10. 4 nm/s. That is approximately twice the removal rate obtained without pauses. The removal rate of thin <b>oil</b> <b>films</b> sensitively depends on the pulse length in the range from 100 to 200 µs and the pause length shorter than 480 µs. We propose a simple equation, based on a model containing reactions with long-lived reactive species during the pause period, to describe the effect of pulse and pause length in the removal rate of thin <b>oil</b> <b>films...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{existence}} of a wind field on the water’s surface accelerated the leeward diffusion of <b>oil</b> <b>films</b> and the faster the wind speed is, the faster the <b>oil</b> <b>films</b> expands and the vertical displacement of leakage oil will be reduced {{in the same time}} period. Due to the combined influence of water flow and wind field on the vertical displacement of a spilled-oil jet-flow, the jet-flow height was limited. During leakage, the spilled oil usually flowed along the water flow direction on the river bottom; however, the frontier oil droplets easily dispersed and moved upward under the influence of buoyancy.|$|R
25|$|Four-stroke {{reciprocating}} {{engines are}} not very suitable for use with hydrogen fuel. The hydrogen can misfire on hot parts like the exhaust valve and spark plugs. Another problem concerns the hydrogenate attack on the lubricating film in reciprocating engines. In a Wankel engine, this problem is circumvented by using a ceramic apex seal against a ceramic surface, {{so that there is}} no <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> to suffer hydrogenate attack. The piston shell must be lubricated and cooled with oil. This substantially increases the lubricating oil consumption in a four-stroke hydrogen engine.|$|E
25|$|A {{block heater}} warms {{the engine of}} an {{automobile}} in order to ease and speed starting and vehicle warm-up in cold weather. The most common type is an electric heating element connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's core plugs, or may be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or heater hoses. The block heater, first known as a head bolt heater, was invented in 1945 by Andrew Freeman in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Freeman used some scrap hoses and copper tubing onto the heating element of an old flat-iron and produced the first headbolt heater, which warmed the engine's water jacket and the <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> between cylinder heads and pistons. U.S. patent #2,487,326 was filed on November 4, 1946 and issued to Freeman on November 8, 1949.|$|E

The damaged bow section sank the next night at [...] to a depth of [...] with what remained of the cargo and 1,600 metric tons of fuel oil in the tanks.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a class of}} potential problems on a periodic half-space for the modeling of electrified <b>oil</b> <b>films,</b> which {{are used in the}} development of novel switchable liquid optical devices (diffraction gratings). A boundary integral formulation which reduces the problem {{to the study of the}} oil-air interface alone is derived and solved in a highly efficient manner using the Nyström method. The <b>oil</b> <b>films</b> encountered experimentally are typically very thin and thus an interface-only integral representation is important for avoiding the near-singularity problems associated with boundary integral methods for long slender domains. The super-algebraic convergence of the proposed method is discussed and demonstrated via appropriate numerical experiments...|$|R

40|$|AbstractErudites of the antiquity {{already knew}} the calming effect of <b>oil</b> <b>films</b> on the sea waves. But one {{had to wait until}} 1774 to read the first {{scientific}} report on <b>oil</b> <b>films</b> from B. Franklin and again 1878 to learn the thermodynamic analysis on adsorption developed by J. Gibbs. Then, in 1891, Agnes Pockels described a technique to manipulate <b>oil</b> <b>films</b> by using barriers. Finally, in 1917, I. Langmuir introduced the experimental and theoretical modern concepts on insoluble monolayers. Since that time, and because it has been found to provide invaluable information at the molecular scale, the monolayer technique has been more and more extensively used, and, during the past decade, an explosive {{increase in the number of}} publications has occurred. Over the same period, considerable and ever-increasing interest in the antimicrobial peptides of various plants, bacteria, insects, amphibians and mammals has grown. Because many of these antimicrobial peptides act at the cell membrane level, the monolayer technique is entirely suitable for studying their physicochemical and biological properties. This review describes monolayer experiments performed with some of these antimicrobial peptides, especially gramicidin A, melittin, cardiotoxins and defensin A. After giving a few basic notions of surface chemistry, the surface-active properties of these peptides and their behavior when they are arranged in monomolecular films are reported and discussed in relation to their tridimensional structure and their amphipathic character. The penetration of these antimicrobial peptides into phospholipid monolayer model membranes, as well as their interactions with lipids in mixed films, are also emphasized...|$|R
