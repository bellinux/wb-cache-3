5|$|As {{early as}} 1857, {{the need for}} a {{lighthouse}} on Point Stephens was identified, due to the proximity to the entrance <b>of</b> <b>Port</b> Stephens, and the dangers of the local coastline to ships.

At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. the most serious being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives.

40|$|The Cruise Itinerary Schedule Design (CISD) problem {{determines the}} optimal {{sequence}} {{of a given}} set <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> call (a <b>port</b> <b>of</b> call is an intermediate stop in a cruise itinerary) and the arrival and departure times at each <b>port</b> <b>of</b> call {{in order to maximize}} the monetary value of the utility at <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> call minus the fuel cost. To solve this problem, in view of the practical observations that most cruise itineraries do not have many <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> call, we first enumerate all sequences <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> call and then optimize the arrival and departure times at each <b>port</b> <b>of</b> call by developing a dynamic programming approach. To improve the computational efficiency, we propose effective bounds on the monetary value of each sequence <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> call, eliminating non-optimal sequences without invoking the dynamic programming algorithm. Extensive computational experiments are conducted and the results showthat, first, using the bounds on the profit of each sequence <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> call considerably improves the computational efficiency; second, the total profit of the cruise itinerary is sensitive to the fuel price and hence an accurate estimation of the fuel price is highly desirable; third, the optimal sequence <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> call is not necessarily the sequencewith the shortest voyage distance, especially when the ports do not have a natural geographic sequence.
