5000|$|<b>Overriding</b> <b>Royalty</b> Interest: a {{share of}} income received, {{unconnected}} to either mineral ownership or working interest. A person or company may receive an <b>overriding</b> <b>royalty</b> by a contract with an owner of a net revenue interest. This is typically received for performing some service for working interest owners. The original owner of an oil and gas lease will sometimes retain an <b>overriding</b> <b>royalty</b> {{as part of a}} farmout agreement.|$|E
50|$|Most of the Trust's {{properties}} {{are on the}} Waddell Ranch in Crane County, Texas, where it owns a 75% net <b>overriding</b> <b>royalty</b> interest in the fee mineral interests (in this case, oil and natural gas). Other properties of the trust are in 32 other Texas counties, {{most of which are}} in the western portion of the state, on the High Plains; the trust owns a 95% net <b>overriding</b> <b>royalty</b> interest in all of its properties outside of the Waddell Ranch.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the time}} The Offspring began writing new {{material}} for their fourth studio album in 1995-1996, {{they were the}} biggest act of Epitaph's roster and had originally declined to leave the label before signing a recording contract with Columbia Records. Following the widespread commercial success of the band's previous album, Smash, frontman Dexter Holland wanted The Offspring to release more albums on Epitaph, or remain on the label for a long time. However, tensions were encountered when Epitaph founder and Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz decided to sell Smash to a major label in [...] "return for a <b>royalty</b> <b>override</b> on it," [...] an action that the band did not like. Gurewitz had approached several major labels, such as Geffen, Capitol and Sony, in attempt to sign The Offspring. The band eventually signed to Columbia, and Holland recalled that they [...] "took less money" [...] with the label and the signing [...] "was not {{to try and make}} more money." [...] Holland also claimed that The Offspring signed to Columbia because they would not [...] "record for someone who thinks Gurewitz can force them to" [...] and would not [...] "record for a guy who's worse than a major label." [...] Recording sessions for Ixnay on the Hombre took place from June to October 1996 at Eldorado Recording Studios with producer Dave Jerden (Alice in Chains, Anthrax, Jane's Addiction, Social Distortion).|$|R

50|$|Oil and gas {{contracts}} have nuances which {{differ from}} standard contracts. For example, when an assignment {{of an oil}} and gas lease expressly provides that any extension or renewal of the lease is subject to an <b>overriding</b> <b>royalty,</b> a new lease that is substantially similar to the first lease and procured by the assignee during the term of the first lease, is regarded, {{as a matter of}} law, as an extension of renewal of the first lease.

50|$|Noe {{was born}} in tiny Evans Landing in Harrison County, Indiana, to John M. Noe and the former Belle McRae. He also lived {{as a child in}} the area of West Point in Hardin County in Kentucky. His {{education}} was limited to county schools. In 1971, he received an honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Louisiana at Monroe, then known as Northeast Louisiana University, to commemorate his lifetime achievements. He served in World War I as a first lieutenant with the 369th Infantry in France. He relocated to Louisiana and garnered a fortune as an independent oilman, both as producer and <b>overriding</b> <b>royalty</b> owner in Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana.|$|E
5000|$|... 1961: The McDonald {{brothers}} {{agree to}} sell Kroc business rights to their operation for $2.7 million, a sum that Kroc borrows {{from a number}} of investors, including Princeton University; Kroc considers the sum extreme, and it strains his relationship with the brothers. In a handshake agreement, the brothers would also receive an <b>overriding</b> <b>royalty</b> of 1% on the gross sales. At the closing table the brothers told Kroc that they were giving the real estate and rights to the original unit to the founding employees. Kroc closed the transaction, then refused to acknowledge the royalty portion of the agreement because it wasn't in writing. The brothers keep their original restaurant, but in an oversight they fail to retain the right to remain a McDonald's franchise. Renamed [...] "The Big M", Kroc drives it out of business by opening a McDonald's just one block north; he attends the opening. Had the brothers maintained their original agreement, which granted them 0.5% of the chain's annual revenues, they or their heirs would have been collecting in excess of $100 million per year today. Had Kroc adhered to the handshake agreement these royalties would now be over $200 million a year.|$|E
