The results of this review were published in 1999: six of the previously accepted records were rejected as not meeting modern identification standards. In 2003, following the split of <b>olivaceous</b> <b>warbler</b> into two species, the accepted records were all reviewed again to ascertain {{which of the two}} they wereall nine proved to be eastern olivaceous warblers. Following the split of Bonelli's warbler into two species, the committee reviewed all the 121 accepted records, and concluded that 51 were western and two were eastern; for the remainder, not enough evidence was available to make a firm decision. The committee had previously stated that it would regard as western Bonelli's warbler all except proven eastern Bonelli's warblers, however, this announcement rescinded that decision. In 2003–04, all desert warbler records were reviewed, and it was concluded that all were referable to the newly split Asian desert warbler, rather than African desert warbler.|$|E

50|$|Considerable evidence, {{much of it}} {{summarised}} in Parkin et al. (2004), {{suggests that}} the genus Hippolais is paraphyletic with respect to Acrocephalus. DNA studies, e.g. Leisler et al. (1997), interpreted by George Sangster in 1997, indicated that the <b>olivaceous</b> and booted/Sykes's <b>warbler</b> grouping (the subgenus Iduna) are {{more closely related to}} Acrocephalus species than they are to icterine and melodious warblers and as a result the Dutch Committee on Avian Systematics (CSNA) has moved these four species into Acrocephalus. A subsequent review by the British Ornithologists' Union Records Committee retained the genus Hippolais, for all eight species, but in agreement with Sangster, acknowledged that they fell into two groups.|$|R
50|$|Western <b>olivaceous</b> <b>warbler</b> {{differs from}} this species in being larger {{and having a}} browner tinge to the upperparts; {{it also has a}} larger bill. Eastern <b>olivaceous</b> <b>warbler</b> {{sometimes}} has a greenish tinge to its upperparts, and can be very difficult to separate from Sykes's warbler, Iduna rama. The song is a fast nasal babbling.|$|E
5000|$|The western <b>olivaceous</b> <b>warbler,</b> {{also known}} as isabelline warbler, (Iduna opaca) is a [...] "warbler", {{formerly}} placed in the Old World warblers when these were a paraphyletic wastebin taxon. It is now considered {{a member of the}} acrocephaline warblers, Acrocephalidae, in the tree warbler genus Iduna. It was formerly regarded as part of a wider [...] "olivaceous warbler" [...] species, but as a result of modern taxonomic developments, this species is now usually considered distinct from the eastern <b>olivaceous</b> <b>warbler,</b> Iduna pallida.It is a small passerine bird, found in dry open country, including cultivation, with bushes or some trees. 2-3 eggs are laid in a nest in low in undergrowth or a bush.

50|$|This is a {{medium-sized}} warbler, similar {{in size to}} the icterine warbler, with a slightly longer bill and shorter wings and a longer tail. Its frequent tail movement is reminiscent of a Sylvia warbler or a chat. Its rather grey plumage {{is similar to the}} <b>olivaceous</b> <b>warbler,</b> but tail movements are diagnostic.|$|E
50|$|These {{are small}} warblers, {{especially}} compared {{to others in}} their genus. They are pale brown (weak tea colour) above and whitish below with buff flanks. The outer tail feathers have pale edges. They have a short pale supercilium, and the bill is strong and pointed. Sykes's is larger and greyer than booted, and most resembles an eastern <b>olivaceous</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|E

50|$|Among {{the birds}} of prey which {{frequent}} the area in fairly large numbers between the southernmost point and the Gedser Marina are the rough-legged buzzard, red kite (often flying low), the western marsh harrier and common buzzard. Smaller birds also occur, including the western yellow wagtail, meadow pipit, common chaffinch and brambling. Much less common species have on occasion also been observed in the area, such as little egret, black stork, Steller's eider, short-toed snake eagle, Blyth's reed warbler, great reed warbler, eastern <b>olivaceous</b> <b>warbler,</b> barred warbler, brown warbler and rock bunting.|$|E
50|$|Ash {{was born}} in Gosforth, Northumberland on 26 May 1925 as son of Sidney and Kathleen Ash né Denley. In 1945, he {{graduated}} to Bachelor of Science at the University of Durham. He received the D.I.C. at the Imperial College London in 1948 and promoted there to Ph.D. in 1952. He was co-author of two fieldguides, The Birds of Somalia (with John E. Miskell) in 1998, and Birds of Ethiopia and Eritrea (with John Atkins) in 2009. Ash discovered several new bird taxa, including the Ankober serin (Serinus ankoberensis), Turdoides squamulata carolinae (a subspecies of the scaly babbler) which he named for his daughter Caroline, Hippolais pallida alulensis (a subspecies of the eastern <b>olivaceous</b> <b>warbler),</b> Acrocephalus baeticatus avicenniae (a subspecies of the African reed warbler), the Ash's lark (Mirafra ashi) which was named after him by Peter Colston in 1982, and Ploceus victoriae, which is now {{thought to be a}} hybrid between the black-headed weaver and the northern brown-throated weaver. In May 1968, he co-discovered the Sidamo lark along with Christian Érard who described this species in 1975 but is now considered as conspecific with Archer's lark. He died on 6 January 2014. In November 1951, Ash married Jonquil Gudgeon, a zoologist, who died three days before him. The couple had one daughter, Caroline Penelope-Jane.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{problems}} of identifying the recently-split Western <b>Olivaceous</b> <b>Warbler</b> Hippolais opaca and Eastern <b>Olivaceous</b> <b>Warbler</b> H pallida reiseri in the field, the migration phenology, passage routes and wintering areas of the two species remain unknown. Both species were mist-netted regularly during autumn and spring migration on Mauritania and the migration phenology of the species in the western Sahara is described here for the first time. Autumn migration of Western Olivaceous Warblers through central Mauritania lasts from early August to early October. Passage at the coast started later and occurred during a shorter time period. The species does not seem to winter in central Mauritania. During spring migration, Western Olivaceous Warblers occurred from early March to early May. No birds were mist-netted in spring at the coast although some were present. The Eastern <b>Olivaceous</b> <b>Warbler</b> was mist-netted at the inland sites only. Only a few birds were mist-netted on autumn migration, which was between late August and early October. The species does not seem to winter in central Mauritania. During spring migration, Eastern Olivaceous Warblers were mist-netted from mid March until early May. There were no indications that the species breeds in central Mauritania.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{phenotypic}} and molecular variation within the polytypic <b>olivaceous</b> <b>warbler</b> H. pallida was examined. This species is {{distributed in the}} southern parts of the western Palaearctic, central Asia and in the arid parts of northern Africa, and also {{in parts of the}} sub-Saharan Sahel zone. Based on morphology, five subspecies, at times assigned to three groups, have been identified. By comparing morphological, behavioural, vocal and molecular variation, we investigated the phenotypic and phylogenetic relationships within the Hippolais pallida group. The morphological and genetic data of the present study support the view of splitting the <b>olivaceous</b> <b>warbler</b> into a western (former subspecies opaca) and an eastern form (former subspecies elaeica, pallida, reiseri and laeneni). Opaca is consistently and significantly larger than the other taxa in all size measurements, even if it does share morphological properties with elaeica in characters associated with migration. The song of the polytypic pallida differs clearly from that of opaca, and is remarkably consistent within its wide range which comprises four subspecies. The molecular analysis, and the resulting phylogenetic pattern, clearly separated opaca on a single branch distant from the other subspecies. The eastern form consists of two non-overlapping haplotype groups: elaeica with relatively diverse mtDNA variation, and the three African subspecies pallida, reiseri and laeneni, which all share the same or closely related mtDNA haplotypes. It remains open whether the African taxa should be regarded as three valid subspecies of the Eastern <b>olivaceous</b> <b>warbler,</b> or if they are better treated as a single African subspecies...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Cermes (Quercus coccifera L.) {{is one of}} {{the rare}} species in Bulgarian flora and it is the only {{evergreen}} representative of the oaks. It is typical mediterian species. Observations were made during the breeding seasons in 2002 and 2003. For estimation of the number of breeding pairs the Line transects method was used. During the period of the investigation, 37 species of birds were established as breeding in the plant formation with prevalence of cermes. The most strong in numbers were found to be the species belonging to order Passeriformes. The common density of birds in these plant formations is 21. 52 pair/ 10 ha. but in particular years it ranges from 9. 41 to 18. 12 pair/ 10 ha. Dominant species in this region were found to be Turtle Dove (Streptopelia turtur), Nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos), <b>Olivaceous</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Hippolais pallida), Blackbird (Turdus merula).

40|$|Given {{the high}} costs of avian obligate brood parasitism, host {{individuals}} are selected to reject parasitic eggs they recognize as foreign. We show that rejection may not necessarily follow egg discrimination when selective removal of the parasitic egg is difficult. We studied egg rejection behaviour in a small host of the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus, the eastern <b>olivaceous</b> <b>warbler</b> Hippolais pallida, by experimental parasitism with model and real non-mimetic cuckoo eggs and video recordings of host behaviour. Hosts pecked 87 per cent (20 out of 23) of the model eggs but eventually accepted 43. 5 per cent (10 out of 23) of them. A similar pattern was found for real cuckoo eggs, which were all pecked, but as many as 47 per cent (7 out of 15) of them were accepted. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a cuckoo host discriminating against real parasitic eggs but often accepting them. Our results also show that in host species experiencing difficulties in performing puncture ejection, non-mimetic cuckoo eggs may avoid rejection by means of their unusually high structural strength...|$|E
