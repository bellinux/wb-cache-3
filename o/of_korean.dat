40|$|This article {{deals with}} the current {{situation}} of language use, ethnic identity, and ethnic relations <b>of</b> <b>Koreans</b> in Central Asia. The primary set of {{data for this study}} came from a sample survey <b>of</b> 1, 302 <b>Koreans</b> in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Moscow, Sankt Perterburg, and Sakhalin done in July 1997 through March 1998. Raymond Breton’s concept of institutional complete-ness proved to be useful in explaining the regional and temporal differences in the level <b>of</b> assimilation <b>of</b> <b>Koreans</b> to Russian culture and society. High levels of education and occupational upward mobility <b>of</b> <b>Koreans</b> in urban areas, historical experiences and structural conditions have contributed to the assimilation <b>of</b> <b>Koreans</b> in Russian society. Nonetheless, Koreans have maintained high levels of ethnic identity primarily because ethnicity is a socially imposed and recognized marker, differentiating Koreans from others and limiting their life chances...|$|R

There, the brigade was to join with Marine reinforcements to re-form the 1st Marine Division, which would then be a part of X Corps for a counterattack at Inchon. However, the North Korean Great Naktong Offensive delayed these plans, as the brigade was needed to repel one more North Korean crossing of the Naktong River.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{characteristic}} traits of Kim's mature style, first seen {{in these three}} films, are gothic excess, surrealism, horror, perversions and sexuality. Although {{in stark contrast to}} the realism, harmony, balance and sentimentality typical <b>of</b> <b>Korean</b> cinema of the time, Kim's films, in an eccentric and metaphorical way, deal with the realities of postwar, industrializing South Korean society and psychology. After having firmly established his auteur status with these films, Kim's unique vision began to wane in his films of the later 1960s.|$|E

5|$|After the {{unification}} of the peninsula up to Taedong River in 668 AD, Gyeongju became the center <b>of</b> <b>Korean</b> political and cultural life.

5|$|Gyeongju is {{strongly}} associated with the education tradition of Hwarangdo ("Way of the Flower of Young Men") which was established and flourished during the Silla period. It is a military and philosophical code that offered the basis of training to Hwarang, a military cadet of youths from the aristocratic class. The training equally emphasized practicing academic and martial arts based on Buddhism and patriotism. A number of Silla's greatest generals and military leaders such as Kim Yu-sin were Hwarang who {{played a central role}} in Silla unification of the Korean peninsula. As Silla was integrated into the next ruling dynasty, Goryeo, the system declined and was officially disbanded in the Joseon dynasty. However, the spirit and discipline were revived in the second half of the 20th century as a form <b>of</b> <b>Korean</b> martial arts with the same name.|$|E
