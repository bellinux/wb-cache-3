5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people <b>off</b> <b>welfare</b> benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E

500|$|Enactment {{of welfare}} reform was a major goal of Bill Clinton's presidency, but when the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican-controlled Congress that lacked protections for people coming <b>off</b> <b>welfare,</b> Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did. A third version came up during his 1996 general {{election}} campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the president to veto it again. But she decided to support the bill, which became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the best political compromise available.

40|$|Research {{suggests}} an important link between maternal welfare and employment, lack of after-school care, and a child's propensity {{to engage in}} increased levels of delinquency. Indeed, with welfare reform, many disadvantaged families, typically single-mother households, face increased pressures to move <b>off</b> of <b>welfare</b> and into employment or risk losing their benefits, which decreases the mother's ability to provide adequate after-school care and supervision. Using longitudinal data from Welfare, Children, and Families: A Three-City Study, this study assessed how changes in maternal welfare and employment status, as well as participation in after-school activities influence rates of adolescents' delinquency 4 Â years later. Results show that early and increased participation in after-school activities served as a protective factor against late adolescent delinquency during a mother's transition <b>off</b> of <b>welfare.</b> Youth who increased their after-school activity participation from early to late adolescence had lower rates of delinquency at wave 3.

40|$|Abstract. The Personal Responsibility and Work Reconciliation (PRWORA) Act of 1997 {{marked a}} {{significant}} change in US welfare policy. Under the terms of this legislation, welfare recipients are limited to 24 consecutive months of monetary benefits, not to exceed 60 months over an individual’s lifetime. The primary intent of PRWORA is to force people <b>off</b> of <b>welfare</b> roles and into the work force. However, it may also have created a second effect; namely that wel-fare recipients treat the 60 months of welfare benefits as a stockpile of wealth. If so, recipients might strategically move on and <b>off</b> of the <b>welfare</b> roles in order to increase the length of time before one exhausts his or her total lifetime benefits. This leads to a high number of “welfare spells”, each relatively short in duration. We present an empirical analysis using data from three counties in Washington State to test whether (and how) an individual’s ability to maxim-ize welfare spells varies by their potential employment opportunities and their socio-economic characteristics. We find that socio-economic characteristics such as race and gender, family structure and educational attainment all significantly influence welfare spells. Additionally, welfare spells differed significantly by county, indicating that local labor market conditions specific to those counties are also important in decisions to “bank ” welfare benefits...|$|R
