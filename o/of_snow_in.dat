5|$|The {{hot springs}} along the Chikuma River for example from {{tourists}} {{into the upper}} reaches of the river. The high rate <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> the mountains surrounding both the Chikuma and Shinano Rivers make them attractive places for snow sports with a number of ski resorts scattered throughout the mountains. The 1998 Winter Olympics, which were held in Nagano, indicate the large number of locations for snow sports in the area.|$|E

5|$|Previously, {{portions}} of the Great Lakes were hit by a significant lake effect snow event which dumped incredible amounts of snow over {{portions of}} central New York. Several areas received over 115inches (over 2.5m) <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> a ten-day period just before the large winter storm as northwesterly winds and unfrozen lake surfaces due to the early winter warm weather favored the heavy snowfall. Several areas across Michigan and Ontario also received significant amounts of snow with locally 1meter (3.3ft) of snow east of Georgian Bay in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, pickup trucks and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} to plow snow. Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free <b>of</b> <b>snow.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E
5|$|The {{hill was}} {{scheduled}} to host two FIS Ski Jumping World Cup events in January 1991, {{but they had to}} be cancelled due to lack <b>of</b> <b>snow.</b> <b>In</b> 1993, the hills hosted a single large hill World Cup event. Since 1997, Tremplin du Praz has been used annually for the FIS Ski Jumping Grand Prix, the premier international summer ski jumping tournament. Originally it consisted of a single competition in the large hill, but from 2010, a qualification run was introduced the day before the main event. The venue has hosted the FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup four times, in 2000, 2002, 2010 and 2011. In February 2006, the venue hosted two FIS Cup competitions in the normal hill. In January 2007, Courchevel hosted two rounds of a FIS-organized junior ski jump in the normal hill. In Nordic combined, the venue has hosted the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup twice, in 1991 and 1992. It also held a World Cup B event in 1997. The venue has been a popular training venue for national teams, and Germany often holds summer training in Courchevel.|$|E

25|$|Nevada and Arizona {{are both}} {{generally}} arid with desert lands and mountains, and receive large amounts <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> the higher elevations in {{and near the}} mountains. New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado are generally arid, with desert lands and mountains as well. They all receive decent amounts of snow and large amounts <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> the high elevations in the mountains, although some areas in far southwestern and southern New Mexico do not receive much snow at all. West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive {{the same amount of}} snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the flat, rolling land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with some hills, and there are significant mountains as well once you reach the Trans-Pecos area.|$|E
50|$|The first lake-effect snow event {{around the}} Great Lakes {{occurred}} as cold air {{swept through the}} region.

Areas on the southern shores of Lake Superior and Georgian Bay in Ontario also received significant amount <b>of</b> <b>snows</b> <b>in</b> excess <b>of</b> 6 inches (15 cm). The low pressure disturbance continued eastward to produce significant snowfalls across the mountains of central Quebec in excess of 12 inches (30 cm), disrupting traffic in several areas.|$|R

25|$|Many {{parts of}} the region spend {{a large part of}} the year under a blanket <b>of</b> <b>snow.</b> <b>In</b> {{northern}} {{parts of the}} USSR, most open ground was permafrost, leading to further problems with pitches, especially with the placement of goalposts. Other regions such as Soviet Central Asia often had desert climates, leading to temperature extremes, and water shortages for the pitch.|$|E
25|$|The {{blizzard}} {{was part}} of a winter remarkable for its snowstorms in the affected states, where total snowfall for the season ranked in the topten and even higher in some areas. In sections of the coastal northeast, 75inches of total snowfall occurred that year. Some Maryland communities getting more than three feet <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> the President's Day blizzard, such as Kingsville and Perry Hall, experienced more than 80inches of snow for the entire winter season.|$|E
25|$|The plains {{are also}} {{susceptible}} to occasional floods, which are caused both by thunderstorms {{and by the}} rapid melting <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> the mountains during warm weather.

Denver's record in 1901 {{for the number of}} consecutive days above 90°F (32°C) was broken during the summer of 2008.

25|$|An {{interesting}} meteorological occurrence was {{the first}} snowfall, which occurred on 8 July 1994 in Pelotas from 11:00am to 1:30pm.

However, the snowfall was more intense further inland, in districts such as Cascata and Quilombo, and was able to cover the vegetation in a white blanket. Snow grains were recorded in Pelotas on 4 September 2006, on 5 September 2008, and on 3 August 2010, and graupel was registered on 12 July 2012, and on 25 September 2012.|$|E

Östersund has also hosted several World Championships in various sports such as biathlon, speed skating and ski orienteering along with Swedish National Championships in cross country skiing and snocross. The city has been the applicant city of Sweden for several Winter Olympic Games, but has yet to host one. The precursor to the Winter Olympic Games, the Nordic Games, were however held at several occasions in the city, due to lack <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> Stockholm.|$|E
