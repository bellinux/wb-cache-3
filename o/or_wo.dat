[...] It becomes a Wolf–Rayet star on the nitrogen sequence, moving from WNL to WNE as more of the outer layers are lost, possibly reaching the WC <b>or</b> <b>WO</b> spectral class as carbon and oxygen from the triple alpha process reach the surface. This process would continue with heavier elements being fused until an iron core develops, {{at which point the}} core collapses and the star is destroyed. Subtle differences in initial conditions, in the models themselves, and most especially in the rates of mass loss, produce different predictions for the final state of the most massive stars. They may survive to become a helium-stripped star or they may collapse at an earlier stage while they retain more of their outer layers. The lack of sufficiently luminous WN stars and the discovery of apparent LBV supernova progenitors has also prompted the suggestion that certain types of LBVs explode as a supernova without evolving further.|$|E

I never hear the loud solitary whistle of the curlew in a summer noon, or the wild mixing cadence of a troop of gray plover in an autumnal morning, without feeling an elevation of soul like the enthusiasm of devotion or poetry. Tell me, my dear friend, to what can this be owing? Are we a piece of machinery, which, like the Æolian harp, passive, takes the impression of the passing accident; or do these workings argue something within us above the trodden clod?

To assess QoL, urinary and bowel symptoms we used the EORTC QLQ-C 30, EORTC QLQ-CX 24, and Leiden Questionnaire. We performed a multivariate analysis to identify factors associated with urinary symptoms. Results Two hundred sixty-eight women were included (152 WO and 116 WM). Quality of life was not significantly different in patients treated by <b>WO</b> <b>or</b> WM. Urinary symptoms were more often reported by patients in the WO group compared to the WM group: feeling of urine retention (53 % vs 32 %), feeling less/no urge to void (59 % vs 14 %), and timed voiding (49 % vs 10 %). With regard to bowel symptoms, {{there was no difference between}} both. Multivariate analysis showed that surgical technique was an independent factor for differences in urinary symptoms. Conclusions Patients undergoing more radical surgery for early-stage cervical cancer report significantly more urinary dysfunction, whereas bowel function and health-related QoL are not decrease...|$|R
