30|$|The main {{outcome of}} COFs was a {{regional}} seasonal climate <b>outlook</b> that <b>was</b> released twice a year, in {{time before the}} main rainfall seasons {{in most parts of}} the GHA. Preparation of the climate <b>outlook</b> <b>was</b> monitored at ICPAC during the program, with support from international climate institutes. The regional <b>outlook</b> <b>was</b> built using climate data collected by the NHMSs. The NHMSs were then responsible for disseminating the forecasts at the national level, using communication media such as radio, TV, and newspaper. The climate <b>outlooks</b> <b>were</b> regional in nature and contained an advisory to users not to use the information as such, at national level, but to contact their respective NHMS for specific guidance.|$|R

5|$|Complications {{may also}} occur with treatment; for example a {{granuloma}} can form at the suture site. Also, the sutured wound can tear again, as occurs {{when there is}} excessive pressure in the airways from ventilation. However, {{for people who do}} receive surgery soon after the injury to repair the lesion, outcome is usually good; the long-term outcome is good for over 90% of people who have TBI surgically repaired early in treatment. Even when surgery is performed years after the injury, the <b>outlook</b> <b>is</b> good, with low rates of death and disability and good chances of preserving lung function.|$|E
5|$|The two {{earliest}} codes {{were concerned}} with clerical matters, and Æthelstan stated that he acted {{on the advice of}} Wulfhelm and his bishops. The first asserts the importance of paying tithes to the church. The second enforces the duty of charity on Æthelstan's reeves, specifying the amount to be given to the poor and requiring reeves to free one penal slave annually. His religious <b>outlook</b> <b>is</b> shown in a wider sacralization of the law in his reign.|$|E

25|$|What ontological hermeneutics {{is saying}} is here that the {{therapist}} strives to avoid an attitude of “expert” or “specialist” on human suffering and healing. Even though many mainstream counseling theories assume such roles, the position of ontological hermeneutics is that such roles create a conflict between freedom and commitment for the client and should therefore be avoided. In fact, hermeneutic theory states that such positions are nonexistent. Therefore, therapist does not intervene with objective truths that are intended to disprove the client’s previously perpetuated ways of thinking and feeling. Fusing horizons “is, instead, a matter of integrating another’s horizon {{in such a way}} that the one’s own <b>outlook</b> <b>is</b> changed in the process”) so that both therapist and client are thus both authentically benefited. And, ontological hermeneutics holds that this process is only possible via authentic dialogue during which both therapist and client utilize their memory and imagination to develop therapeutic possibilities. Furthermore, through this process, empathy is seen as a deeper phenomenon (intropathy) for relating to others; the entire process being what may be referred to as empathic envisioning, and compels therapists to become subjective in their value-laden conversations.|$|E

500|$|After {{a strong}} {{show of support}} from the University, Schulz ran into further {{academic}} problems.

Fishermen do not target the creatures sperm whales eat, but long-line fishing operations in the Gulf of Alaska have complained about sperm whales stealing fish from their lines.|$|E
500|$|The same {{paper had}} {{received}} Keable's second novel, 1922's The Mother of All Living, favourably; reviewer Louise Maundell Fields called it [...] "Not only...better from an artistic {{point of view}} ... its general <b>outlook</b> <b>is</b> both steadier and more mature. [...] the book has in {{it so much that}} is well done and worth while that one does not feel inclined to carp at its comparatively few weaknesses." [...] On the whole, other reviews were less favourable. The characters in both Peradventure and Recompense were criticised for lacking depth: reviewers said they served only as vehicles for conveying different theoretical points of view. A later book, 1927's Ann Decides, was dismissed succinctly by the Chicago Daily Tribune as [...] "tosh".|$|E

500|$|Although the Zuo zhuan was {{probably}} not originally a commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals (Chunqiu [...] )a work which was traditionally viewed as a direct creation of Confuciusits basic philosophical <b>outlook</b> <b>is</b> also strongly Confucian in nature. [...] Its overarching theme is that haughty, evil, and stupid individuals generally bring disaster upon themselves, while those who are good, wise, and humble are usually justly rewarded. [...] The Confucian principle of [...] "ritual propriety" [...] or [...] "ceremony" [...] (lǐ [...] ) is seen as governing all actions, including war, and to bring bad consequences if transgressed. [...] However, the observance of li is never shown as guaranteeing victory, and the Zuo zhuan includes many examples of the good and innocent suffering senseless violence. [...] Much of the Zuo zhuans status as a literary masterpiece stems from its [...] "relentlessly realistic portrayal of a turbulent era marked by violence, political strife, intrigues, and moral laxity".|$|E
500|$|After the 2009 Afghan presidential election, Afghan President Karzai's {{views about}} the {{security}} issues confronting Afghanistan {{and how best to}} deal with them reportedly changed. This impacted the working relationship between the President of Afghanistan and some of his cabinet ministers including his intelligence chief. Saleh said, [...] "He [...] thought democracy had hurt him as a person. His family had been attacked by the media unfairly, and the West was criticizing him unfairly. So after a presidential election, he was a changed man, and we could not have the same relationship as before the presidential election." [...] Political analyst Ahmed Rashid in 2010 observed the same, [...] "Karzai's new <b>outlook</b> <b>is</b> the most dramatic political shift he has undergone in the twenty-six years that I have known him." [...] Both Saleh and Interior Minister Hanif Atmar subsequently had strong disagreements with Karzai on how to proceed against the Taliban, who Karzai began referring to as [...] "brothers". At that point Saleh and Atmar were increasingly isolated in the Karzai administration.|$|E

[...] McKinley swept the populous northeastern states, and the Midwest.
