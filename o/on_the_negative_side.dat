5|$|When {{used as a}} tunable {{narrow band}} filter, Michelson interferometers exhibit a number of {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry–Pérot interferometers or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a Fabry–Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>side,</b> Michelson interferometers have a relatively restricted wavelength range and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance.|$|E

Equally important is getting feedback that indicates how others perceive your leadership behavior. Purpose of Study: To investigate the degree of self-awareness regarding military cadets’ leadership behaviour and how this was correlated with others perceptions of the same leadership behavior. Method: This study was an explorative and descriptive study. 26 cadets at the Norwegian Military Academy filled out the Developmental Leadership Questionnaire (DLQ) measuring their degree of developmental leadership, {{as well as their}} degree of transactional leadership and non-leadership. The cadets also had to send the same DLQ to 6 - 10 commanders, colleagues and subordinates in order to get feedback from them on their leadership behavior. Findings and Results: It was found that the cadets scored themselves lower on both developmental leadership and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> positive parts of transactional leadership and higher <b>on</b> both <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> parts of transactional leadership and on non-leadership as compared to their respondents. Conclusions and Recommendations: In the scores the cadets gave themselves they scored quite high on developmental leadership and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> positive sides of transactional leadership, and quite low <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>sides</b> of transactional leadership and on non-leadership; one may conclude that they have a high degree of self-awareness.

Tellis {{argues that}} the Indo-US nuclear deal is {{attractive}} to India because it gives it access to far more options on its civil nuclear programme than would otherwise be the case, primarily by ending its isolation from the international nuclear community. These options include access to latest technologies, access to higher unit output reactors which are more economical, access to global finance for building reactors, ability to export its indigenous small reactor size PHWRs, better information flow for its research community, etc. Finally, the deal also gives India two options that are relatively independent from the three-stage programme, {{at least in terms}} of their dependencies on success or failure. The first option is that, India can opt to stay with the first stage reactors as long as the global supply of uranium lasts. The plus side of this is that it covers any risk from short term delays or failures in implementing the three-stage programme. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>side,</b> this is an option that is antithetical to the underlying objective of energy independence through the exploitation of thorium.|$|E
