25|$|This {{series of}} {{evaluations}} is providing {{a mechanism to}} characterize in more precise terms exactly {{what is necessary to}} compute in meaning. As such, the evaluations provide an emergent mechanism to identify the problems and solutions for computations with meaning. These exercises have evolved to articulate more of the dimensions that are involved in our use of language. They began with apparently simple attempts to identify word senses computationally. They have evolved to investigate the interrelationships among the elements in a sentence (e.g., semantic role labeling), relations between sentences (e.g., coreference), and the nature <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> saying (semantic relations and sentiment analysis).|$|E
25|$|The {{second point}} of {{contention}} between freewill and open theists is exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events. Freewill theists have traditionally affirmed {{what is known as}} simple foreknowledge according to which God, prior to creation, just “sees” or knows all that will ever happen in history. Sanders argues that the simple foreknowledge view has conflicts with types of biblical texts mentioned below and has two philosophical problems. The first problem is the old debate about whether or not divine foreknowledge entails determinism. Open theists argue that exhaustive definite foreknowledge is incompatible with the freewill of creatures. The other problem with simple foreknowledge is that it is useless for God to possess it since once God knows {{what is going to happen}} God cannot change it from happening. Sanders argues that simple foreknowledge cannot explain such things as prophecy, divine guidance, or why God did not prevent particular evils. Instead, open theists affirm “dynamic omniscience” (a term coined by Sanders). God knows all that has happened in the past and all that is happening in the present. God knows those future events that are determined to occur and God knows all that could possibly happen but does not know as definite what creatures with freewill will do. God has anticipatory knowledge (foresight) <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> likely to do so God is not caught off-guard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Until I {{saw these}} chicks, Redwood, I don't think I began to realise--anything--of the {{possibilities}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> making. It's {{only beginning to}} dawn upon me ... the possible consequences...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did he say so?" [...] {{said little}} Lucy, her hazel eyes opening wide with anxiety. [...] "I {{never heard him}} say {{anything}} of that kind; I thought he approved <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|She nodded, and {{her eyes}} were luminous. [...] "There {{is such a thing as}} old sake. Won't you, Grant, please, just {{remember}} back ... a little ... oh, so little ... <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> to each other ... then?" ...|$|R
500|$|Regarding the {{inspiration}} behind the remix, Hayden Thorpe from Wild Beasts group told The Guardian: [...] "The unlikeness of this match was perhaps what compelled {{us to take}} it on. Gaga in many ways is the epitome <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not. She is the butcher to our butter knife. The essential thrill is always to keep eluding {{what is expected of}} us and what we expect of ourselves." [...] The last of the remix to be released was The Weeknd's take on [...] "Marry the Night" [...] which featured Illangelo, thus earning him a co-producer credit on it.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} a New York Times Best Seller and was praised by critics. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that it [...] "eviscerates a basic assumption: that slavery in America ended with the Civil War." [...] She praised the book's {{evidence}} as [...] "relentless and fascinating," [...] although she thought that the conceit of reconstructing Cottenham's life gives the book [...] "a shaky start". Leonard Pitts, {{a columnist for the}} Miami Herald, wrote that [...] "Slavery by Another Name is an astonishing book. It will challenge and change your understanding of what we were as Americans - and <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> I cannot recommend it to you highly enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Steiner is {{regarded}} as a polymath and often credited with recasting the role of the critic by exploring art and thought unbounded by national frontiers or academic disciplines. He advocates generalisation over specialisation, and insists that the notion of being literate must encompass knowledge of both arts and sciences. Steiner believes that nationalism is too inherently violent to satisfy the moral prerogative of Judaism, saying [...] "that because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> there are things we can't do." ...|$|E
6000|$|When we as strangers sought [...] Their {{catering}} care, Veiled smiles bespoke their thought [...] <b>Of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were.</b> They warmed as they opined [...] Us {{more than}} friends - That {{we had all}} resigned [...] For love's dear ends.|$|R
60|$|As the sun slowly sank {{behind the}} hills in the west, I forgot the thirst and the hunger which had assailed me. So great was {{the fear in}} my mind because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> about to attempt, that bodily discomforts seemed as nothing.|$|R
5000|$|... "sitting in midair, {{watching}} me paint {{the ceiling in}} the living room, rocking back and forth... I was on an 8-foot stepladder. I asked if he approved <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing to the house, if the colors were to his liking. He smiled and he nodded his head." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Hangman" [...] {{is about}} the {{feelings}} of an innocent man condemned to be executed for a crime he did not commit. Of capital punishment Harper stated [...] "That people can even think about bringing back {{the death penalty is}} profane. Yes, some people deserve to be locked up forever, but they're the responsibility of society. They are part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> We {{have to be able to}} civilise, to teach with heart, and to keep the savage in ourselves under scrutiny rather than allowing the mob in us to rule." ...|$|E
2500|$|The milieu is {{identified}} by the author as science fantasy. As L'Engle explains in her book The Rock That Is Higher: Story as Truth: [...] "If we limit ourselves to the possible and provable... we render ourselves incapable of change and growth, {{and that is something}} that should never end. If we limit ourselves to the age that we are, and forget all the ages that we have been, we diminish our truth." [...] Later in the same book, she further explains her use of the science fantasy genre: [...] "Writing A Wrinkle in Time... was my first effort in a genre now called 'science fantasy', and science fantasy is not far from fairy tale, that world which delves deep into the human psyche, struggling to find out at least a little more <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all about." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Blumenthal's view, {{experiments}} such {{as these}} show that our appreciation of food is subjective, determined by information sent by the senses to the brain: [...] "the {{ways in which we}} make sense <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> eating and decide {{whether we like it or}} not depend to a large extent on memory and contrast. Memory provides us with a range of references – flavours, tastes, smells, sights, sounds, emotions – that we draw on continually as we eat." [...] His dishes, therefore, tend to be designed to appeal to the senses in concert, and through this to trigger memories, associations and emotions. Thus the Nitro-poached Green Tea and Lime Mousse on the Fat Duck menu is served with spritz of ‘lime grove’ scent from an atomiser; and the Jelly of Quail dish includes among its tableware a bed of oak moss, as well as being accompanied by a specially created scent of oak moss that is dispersed at the table by means of dry ice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let {{me remind}} you, then, <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> saying {{a little time}} ago," [...] he went on. [...] "You will not take offence? You will understand, I am sure. Those things that lie nearest to my heart {{concerning}} my country are the things of which I cannot speak." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The LRB {{name was}} never 'for sale'. It {{was lost to}} Stephen Housden because of a legal {{document}} that transferred the name to We Two Pty. Ltd. The name should have been licensed, not transferred. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> ill-advised and totally unaware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> leaving behind." [...] Graeham Goble (2005) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} that she {{reasoned}} much upon the subject," [...] said the young man, [...] "and I am sure I did not. We made no plans. Every day <b>we</b> thought only <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing or saying, and not at all <b>what</b> <b>we</b> had done or would do. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> very happy.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{in safety}} best we may [...] Compose our present evils, with regard [...] <b>Of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> and were, dismissing quite [...] All {{thoughts}} of war." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Helen, [...] "that a {{great deal}} of evil is done to {{children}} in this way, by our not thinking <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> saying." ...|$|E
60|$|After this, {{it will be}} {{necessary}} to define superstition, in order to have some tolerably clear understanding <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> talking about. I beg leave to define it as--Fear of the unknown.|$|E
5000|$|... "We {{are in a}} 'revolution <b>of</b> consciousness' .... <b>What</b> <b>we</b> (<b>are)</b> {{looking for}} is the truth." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{theme of}} the festival focused on the artists' independence, self-sufficiency, and DIY ethic: the entire affair {{manifested}} a [...] "fierce resistance to corporate takeover." [...] As described by Bratmobile singer Allison Wolfe, [...] "The whole point <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing was DIY, create it yourself, taking over {{the means of production}} for ourselves, and creating something ourselves." ...|$|R
5000|$|Burns told The Australian Women's Weeklys Susan Moore that [...] "When {{we arrived}} new wave was very full-on {{and we had}} pretty much a street image. Then when we did Space Race, which <b>we</b> felt <b>was</b> an {{extension}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing, I guess some people didn't {{like the idea of}} a concept album ... we copped a lot of flack." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These {{officers}} who {{have so much}} wind to spare in camp cannot afford the time to consider such trifles as a few scouts skulkin' around to make certain <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is for ever!' {{repeated}} Philip. 'But, Laura, let us {{be content}} with our own knowledge <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to each other. Do not let us call in others to see our happiness.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{can be no}} harm {{in giving}} you some idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to do. Being so old a sailor, Master Cap, you've heard, no doubt, of such a port as Frontenac?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why? Do {{you think}} that, after what I have gone through, I {{was shocked at}} seeing you kill three of those wretches? Two months ago I suppose I should have thought it dreadful, but those two months have changed us altogether. Think <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> then and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now. There remain only you, Mrs. Hunter, myself, and your letter said, Mr. Wilson. Is he the only one?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Involuntary Doppelgänger" [...] is {{the first}} track from our {{upcoming}} release Relentless Mutation. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> extremely proud <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to accomplish with Dave Otero at Flatline Audio, {{he was able to}} keep the production clear enough for every instrument to be heard, even at such a fast tempo. We hope you enjoy this track, and we'll be releasing more of Relentless Mutation soon.|$|R
5000|$|Eccsame the Photon Band marks Kurt Heasley's Lilys {{shift to}} a slower, moodier, and more spaced-out sound. “I went closest to what my 23 year-old brain could stand with Eccsame— {{to the edge of}} my own {{mortality}} and sanity", Heasley says. “as far as the period, the energy, the zeitgeist <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> intending, that was the only time we ever did it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Master Bridgenorth, {{since you}} {{act as a}} magistrate, I desire to be treated {{according}} {{to the laws of}} England; and demand to know <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> accused, and by whose authority we are arrested?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{the son of}} the man at St. Alwyth," [...] he said. [...] "I {{have seen}} you in the streets before. What think you <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doing? I have heard of you {{attending}} meetings there." ...|$|E
6000|$|Weissmann {{was not to}} be hastened. [...] "If we do not now go slowly we lose much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{trying to}} attain. We must take her pulse and temperature, and observe the {{position}} of every object." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Sound of Boston, lead vocalist James Bagshaw noted that signing on to Heavenly Records did not change their recording process. [...] "Nothing changed, everything stayed exactly the same... At no point did they say, you know, go into the studio. If they did, we probably wouldn’t have signed to them because we liked the idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing," [...] Bagshaw stated.|$|R
60|$|Then he went out, {{my father}} leaning {{heavily on his}} arm, and Jerry and I faced {{each other in the}} gloom, heeding not {{the fact that we had}} had nothing to eat during nearly eight and forty hours, save the chips of ham and the unsavory mess {{prepared}} by Jim; thinking only <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> to do, and the many chances against success.|$|R
30|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have <b>been</b> {{discussing}} {{in terms}} of coordination, mirroring and reflexivity can be considered, and measured, as synchronization.|$|R
