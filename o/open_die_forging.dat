40|$|<b>Open</b> <b>die</b> <b>forged</b> 7050 {{aluminum}} alloy has residual stresses {{that can be}} measured by the hole-drilling method following standard ASTM E 837 - 01. Weber Metals (Paramount, CA) assumes that the stress is uniform throughout the thickness of an <b>open</b> <b>die</b> <b>forged</b> plate. Four different stress relieved 7050 aluminum samples were tested to confirm if the measurements by the hole-drilling method at {{the surface of a}} plate is indicative of the stress throughout. The different stress relief methods included: two water quenched samples at temperature ranges of 60 °- 90 °F and 120 °- 130 °F and two samples plastically deformed by forging at room temperature 1 % and 3 %. For accurate measurements, a strain gauge rosette, CEA- 06 - 062 UL- 120, was applied to the samples and drilled with a RS- 200 Milling Guide by Micro-Measurements. The final three microstrain values at the depth of 0. 100 inches were tabulated by the P 3 Strain Indicator and Recorder. The strains were then converted into stresses following equations provided by the standard. Before drilling into samples, the method was calibrated with a plate that had a known low level of residual stress between 0 - 2 ksi. Testing confirmed the residual stress to be 0. 65 ksi. Each sample was tested and results confirmed the residual stress to be non-uniform through the cross-section of the forged plates. The two water quenched samples had residual stress in tension at the surface; the two plastically deformed samples had residual stress in compression at the surface. There were no trends for either type of sample for residual stress variation from the surface to the center. Overall, the 3 % plastically deformed sample would be the recommended residual stress reducing method before machining...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of grain orientation on the high cycle fatigue properties of 7050 -T 7452 aerospace grade aluminum, rotating-bending fatigue tests were performed on longitudinal (LG) and short transverse (ST) specimens taken from two sample sets (Method A and Method B) of <b>open</b> <b>die</b> <b>forged</b> 7050 aluminum. The fatigue specimens were machined to a 0. 22 ̆ 2 gage diameter and 42 ̆ 2 length and subsequently hand polished to a mirror finish to minimize potential crack initiation sites. The tests were conducted on a Fatigue Dynamics RBF- 300 HT tester in the fully reversed loading condition, with stress levels varying from 20 ksi - 45 ksi in 5 ksi increments, except the 25 ksi stress level. The applied stress amplitude and number of cycles to failure for each specimen were plotted to generate S-N curves comparing both Method A and B. The fatigue life was comparable between Method A and Method B sample sets and the fatigue life of longitudinal samples was greater than the fatigue life of short transverse samples. Runout tests were stopped at 107 cycles and set as 20 ksi for both orientations. There was no significant statistical difference between Method A and Method B on fatigue life of 7050 -T 7452 aluminum. There was a significant statistical difference between LG and ST specimen orientations on fatigue life due to the precipitate alignment and grain flow from forging...|$|R

Tensile testing of the specimens cut from the forged discs showed that the Cu-forged disc had a fairly high yield strength of 330 MPa, UTS of 340 MPa and a plastic strain to fracture of 15 %, but the Cu– Al₂O₃ composite-forged discs did not show any macroscopic plastic yielding.

40|$|The {{presence}} of internal voids is commonly observed throughout the casting and solidification of large size ingots. Their mechanical closure is generally achieved {{during the initial}} deformation of a hot forming process. The present work focuses on the determination of optimal forging conditions for void elimination in large steel ingots {{with respect to the}} involved materials and industrial processes. A state of the art is compiled as initial research in order to develop a solid background in void elimination theory. An extensive review of void closure models is presented and characterisation techniques are discussed. It is shown that current void closure models lack application to industrial scale forgings. An analysis of the industrial partner’s <b>open</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> procedure ensues and characteristic forging sequences are introduced. Feasibility for further forging analysis using experimental data is evaluated and successfully proposed. A novel method for fast calculating void closure models is developed. Rational polynomial functions are established for the calculation of material dependant constants. 3 D mapping is used to evaluate the influence of the triaxiality state and material parameters. The void closure model is validated for use on high strength steels from the industrial partner. Void closure is modeled and simulated during an <b>open</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> sequence. The effect of in-billet void positioning is studied and the forging sequence effectiveness for void closure is validated and characterized for different zones. An original combination of data from relative void closure and volumetric strain rate provides a way for forging optimisation.
