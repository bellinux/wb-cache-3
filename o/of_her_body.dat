5|$|Anna Anderson (16 December 1896– 12 February 1984) was {{the best}} known of several impostors who claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia. Anastasia, the {{youngest}} daughter of the last Tsar and Tsarina of Russia, Nicholas II and Alexandra, was killed along with her parents and siblings on 17 July 1918 by communist revolutionaries in Yekaterinburg, Russia; but the location <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>body</b> was unknown until 2007.|$|E

She can withstand impacts up to high caliber rifle fire, {{though she has}} been wounded by fire from an MP-40 sub-machine gun.|$|R
60|$|Her thick dark brows almost met {{above her}} {{irregular}} nose, {{she had a}} wide, rather thick mouth. But her face was lifted to another world of life: not to heaven or death: but to some place where she still lived, in spite <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>body's</b> absence.|$|R
5|$|On June 1, 1997, young {{grandson}} Malcolm set {{a fire in}} Shabazz's apartment. Shabazz suffered burns over 80 percent <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>body,</b> {{and remained}} in intensive care for three weeks, at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, New York. She underwent five skin-replacement operations as doctors struggled to replace damaged skin and save her life. Shabazz died of her injuries on June 23, 1997. Malcolm Shabazz was sentenced to 18 months in juvenile detention for manslaughter and arson.|$|E
5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. When {{one of the}} males approaches the female, he uses his upper jaw to grab her dorsum. The male will then roll the female over by grabbing one of her pectoral fins, which are located on either side <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>body.</b> Once he is on her ventral side, the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them venter to venter, with both undersides together. The mating process lasts for 30–90 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children reconstructed the child's face {{to provide}} the public with an {{estimation}} of the victim's appearance during life. They aimed to generate tips to a potential identity and to locate the individual or individuals responsible for the disposal <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>body.</b> After the reconstruction was released and news coverage began nationwide {{a large amount of}} public attention emerged; an estimated 56 million people viewed reports on the case. Half of these occurred within the first week after the body was found.|$|E

40|$|Teens {{present a}} unique {{challenge}} for the childbirth educator. A committed educator must find creative teaching strategies that will ease an adolescent's tension and provide a safe environment where a teen can “own” the message <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>body's</b> ability to give birth. The author of this column presents one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own strategies for teaching relaxation techniques to adolescents...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} reboot {{continuity}} Tinya Wazzo {{is also the}} fifth to join, under the codename Apparition. As in pre-Zero Hour reality, she becomes romantically involved with Ultra Boy.

5|$|The unnamed half-female form of Shiva is also {{alluded to}} in the epic Mahabharata. In Book XIII, Upamanyu praises Shiva rhetorically asking if there is anyone else whose half-body is shared by his spouse, and adds that the {{universe}} had risen from the union of sexes, as represented by Shiva's half-female form. In some narratives, Shiva is described as dark and fair-complexioned, half yellow and half white, half woman and half man, and both woman and man. In Book XIII, Shiva preaches to Parvati that half of his body is made up <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been {{deposited}} on top of a layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>body</b> had been buried.|$|E
5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} that Tabak had {{then tried to}} conceal the crime by disposing <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>body.</b> The court heard that DNA swabs taken from Yeates' body had provided a match with Tabak. Samples found behind the knees of her jeans indicated {{she may have been}} held by the legs as she was carried, while fibres suggested contact with Tabak's coat and car. Blood stains were found on a wall overlooking a quarry close to where Yeates was discovered. The prosecution also said that Tabak attempted to implicate Jefferies for the murder during the police investigation, and that in the days following Yeates' death, he had made internet searches for topics that included the length of time a body takes to decompose and the dates of refuse collections in the Clifton area.|$|E

5|$|In her legend, Haumea's many {{children}} came from different parts <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>body.</b> The dwarf planet Haumea {{appears to be}} almost entirely made of rock, with only a superficial layer of ice; most of the original icy mantle {{is thought to have}} been blasted off by the impact that spun Haumea into its current high speed of rotation, where the material formed into the small Kuiper belt objects in Haumea's collisional family. There could therefore be additional outer moons, smaller than Namaka, that have not yet been detected. However, HST observations have confirmed that no other moons brighter than 0.25% of the brightness of Haumea exist within the closest tenth of the distance (0.1% of the volume) where they could be held by Haumea's gravitational influence (its Hill sphere). This makes it unlikely that any more exist.|$|E
5|$|In the Fire Kingdom, Don John the Flame Lord {{shows up}} to tell Flame Princess {{she is not}} brutish enough to rule over the Flame subjects. Her father, the Flame King, appears as his {{daughter}} is deprived <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>body</b> temperature and crown. He tells Flame Princess he has arranged her marriage with Don John. When she tries to escape their palace, its inhabitants– put under a mind-control spell by Don John– try to seize her. Cinnamon Bun, riding his wolf, punctures the palace walls. He rescues Flame Princess, and the two escape. They enlist the aid of Finn, the ex of Flame Princess.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{has only}} {{performed}} this song live once, on The Virgin Tour in 1985. It {{was the first}} song of the second act of the show. Madonna wore a black, fringed micro-top and similar skirt, with her belly-button exposed, {{and a number of}} crucifixes in different sizes, hanging from different parts <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>body.</b> As the guitar intro of the song started, Madonna appeared on the side-stage and started dancing energetically, while flashlights fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled the steel structure present on the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main stage. It was included on the video release, titled , which was shot in Detroit.|$|E

50|$|Neslihan {{responded to}} criticisms <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lack <b>of</b> {{revealing}} <b>her</b> <b>body</b> {{by stating that}} she wants people to {{take an interest in}} her for her skills as a musician, not for <b>her</b> choice <b>of</b> clothing.|$|R

5|$|Obayashi {{already had}} {{experience}} with special effects {{from his work}} on television commercials. Obayashi and the cameraman oversaw the special effects for the film. Obayashi desired the special effects to look unrealistic, as if a child created them. For the scene in which Ai Matsubara's character vanishes under the blood, Obayashi had her suspended nude, pouring buckets of blue paint on her to create a blue-screen chroma key effect where the blue colored parts <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>body</b> would deteriorate on camera. The outcome {{of a lot of}} these effects would be unknown until the film was completed. Obayashi stated that sometimes the effects did not turn out how he originally envisioned them.|$|E
5|$|On 11 January 2006, Venerable Ho died peacefully in {{her sleep}} at the Man Fut Tong Nursing Home, at about 9:30pm, just one month before turning 98. Until being {{hospital}}ised in November 2005, she had cooked for and looked after herself and played {{an active role in}} running both the temple and the nursing home. During her hospital stay, she suffered a stroke, which affected her speech and paralysed the left side <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>body.</b> Discharged in December 2005, she was recuperating well at the nursing home until she developed a chest infection and breathing difficulties a few days before she died.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 2014, Kesha {{checked into}} Timberline Knolls Residential Treatment Center, a rehab {{facility}} in Lemont, Illinois, for eating disorder treatment. Kesha's mother Pebe Sebert {{confirmed that the}} eating disorder Kesha was suffering with is bulimia nervosa {{and that she had}} been struggling with it since she was signed. She also alleged that Dr. Luke was partly the cause of Kesha's eating disorder, saying that Luke had allegedly told her to lose weight after he signed her, comparing the shape <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>body</b> to a refrigerator. Sebert asserted that this had caused Kesha's disorder to worsen. Kesha had completed her treatment on March 6, 2014, after spending two months in rehab.|$|E

5|$|The photographers in 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2004 were {{respectively}} Antoine Verglas, James Porto, Michael Zeppetello and Steven White for the Swimsuit Issue works. From 2005–2007 Gair {{took the}} photographs <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>body</b> paintings herself. Verglas again photographed the bodypainting for the 2008 Swimsuit Issue. No body painting pictures {{have been chosen}} as the main image {{on the cover of}} the Swimsuit Issue. However, in the 2005 Swimsuit Issue (pictured left) in which Carolyn Murphy is the cover model, Jessica White was shown as an inset on the cover in a Miami Dolphins jersey body painting by Gair. Thus, as a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue photographer Gair debuted on the cover in a sense. In 2006 a small cropped portion of her photograph of a bodypainting of Klum appeared in an inset on the cover, but no bodypainting was apparent.|$|E
