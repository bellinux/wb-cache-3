5|$|Throughout the 1890s, Tesla {{would pursue}} his ideas for {{wireless}} lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements {{on the possibility}} <b>of</b> <b>wireless</b> communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.|$|E
5|$|Sennheiser sound {{equipment}} {{was used for}} the audio. According to Matt Napier, Madonna's monitor engineer, they used Sennheiser's Wireless Systems Manager software to tweak frequencies. Madonna used an HSP 4 headset {{at the beginning of the}} show, later switching to a Sennheiser SKM 5200-II handheld transmitter. Sennheiser transmitters were also used by Minaj, M.I.A. and LMFAO, and Green's microphone used an MD 5235 capsule. Napier said in a Mix article that they needed gold-plated transmitters for Madonna and Green, which were provided by Sennheiser the day of the show. Professional Wireless Systems (PWS), a Masque Sound company, were in charge <b>of</b> <b>wireless</b> sound monitoring; in a series of trial runs, PWS chose a frequency that eliminated interference from other systems.|$|E
40|$|Network {{reliability}} analyses {{have received}} much attention in heterogeneous wireless network performance evaluation {{during the last}} few years. In this paper, a method for heterogeneous wireless network reliability evaluation to meet the required levels <b>of</b> heterogeneous <b>wireless</b> network differences <b>of</b> various graph-theoretic connectivity measures is proposed. A concept <b>of</b> heterogeneous <b>wireless</b> network reliability degree is proposed and a heterogeneous wireless network reliability entropy-based method for analyzing the proposed reliability measure is discussed. This method is based on heterogeneous wireless network survivability and stability analyses. Its core is the computation <b>of</b> some heterogeneous <b>wireless</b> network combinatorial invariants. These invariants, once computed, directly provide pure and simple framework for computation <b>of</b> heterogeneous <b>wireless</b> network reliability. We illustrate how a new approach to assessing the performance <b>of</b> in heterogeneous <b>wireless</b> networks. Our results also illustrate how the characteristics <b>of</b> the heterogeneous <b>wireless</b> networks may affect the performance of the different measures. We also present some simulation results...|$|R

The ships, , and were built as the {{culmination}} of a major naval expansion program begun in the 1870s following Italy's defeat at the Battle of Lissa in 1866. The Re Umbertos incorporated several innovations over previous Italian designs, including a more efficient arrangement of the main battery, installation <b>of</b> <b>wireless</b> telegraphs, and in Sardegna, the first use of triple-expansion steam engines in an Italian capital ship. Designed by Benedetto Brin, they retained the very thin armor protection and high top speeds of his earlier designs.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Engineers Signal Service, {{formed in}} 1912, was given {{responsibility}} for communications that included signal dispatch, telegraph, telephone and later wireless communications, from army headquarters to brigade {{and down to}} battery level for the artillery.

At {{the start of the}} war, the Army had a small number <b>of</b> <b>wireless</b> sets, which in addition to being heavy and unreliable, operated on longwave.
