5|$|A half-way line, {{parallel}} to the back line, divides the pitch in two. The start of each period <b>of</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> resumption of play following a goal starts with all players in the half they are defending. The line was also used for the obselete offside rule.|$|E
5|$|As Näslund's {{free agency}} {{approached}} on 1 July 2008, Näslund {{made it clear}} that the style <b>of</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> the player personnel of a team would be important factors in determining which team he would sign with after his contract with the Canucks expired. He was admittedly frustrated with Vigneault's defensive coaching style.|$|E

Among new signings were 2006 World Cup stars such as Franck Ribéry, Miroslav Klose and Luca Toni. Bayern {{went on to win}} the Bundesliga, being on top of the standings on every single week <b>of</b> <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> the DFB-Pokal against Borussia Dortmund.|$|E
5|$|García {{has worn}} the number 7 jersey for both club and country {{during the course}} of her short career.

5|$|Leto won the 2003 and 2004 World Cyber Games, and {{was signed}} {{to become a}} {{professional}} game player that same year.

5|$|Stevens {{started the}} 1996–97 {{season with a}} one-game {{suspension}} due to a high-sticking penalty against Igor Larionov, which drew blood. The team, however, returned to a solid style <b>of</b> <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> finished the season atop the Atlantic Division, though they would be eliminated in the playoffs once again by the Hudson River rival New York Rangers. Stevens finished second on the team among defencemen in scoring behind Scott Niedermayer.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of articles of agreement, agreed before matches by the stakeholders, largely resolved any problems between patrons and match organisers. The concept {{was more important}} in terms of defining the rules <b>of</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> eventually these were codified as the Laws of Cricket.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of Patrick Vieira to Juventus, Fàbregas was given the Frenchman's number 4 shirt and featured regularly in the Arsenal central midfield alongside Gilberto Silva. He made 49 appearances in all competitions during the 2005–06 season. Despite his young age, his performances came under greater scrutiny due to his increased involvement in the first team. Further, as Fàbregas possessed a smaller frame and played with less aggression than Vieira, there were initially doubts over his ability {{to fill in the}} void left by the Frenchman. Nevertheless, Fàbregas asserted his own style <b>of</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> impressed pundits in the Champions League against Real Madrid and Juventus. In the latter, he scored Arsenal's first goal and set up Thierry Henry for the second, at the same time proving that he could compete against tough, hard-tackling midfielders like Vieira. He then played in the Final against his former club Barcelona, but Arsenal were defeated 2–1, completing a trophyless 2005–06 campaign for Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|All line {{markings}} on the pitch {{form part of}} the area which they define. For example, a ball on the side line {{is still in the}} field of play; a ball on the line of the penalty circle is in the penalty circle; a foul committed over the 23-metre (25-yard) line has occurred in the 23-metre area. A ball must completely cross a boundary line to be out <b>of</b> <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> a ball must wholly cross the goal line before a goal is scored.|$|E
5|$|Bosh {{is noted}} for his leadership. When {{he was the}} leader of the Raptors, he was not known for being vocal on the court, preferring to {{maintain}} his quiet and humble demeanor but expecting his teammates to match his work ethic. However, Bosh was also known to deliver stern rebukes to teammates who make bad calls on the court. Throughout his career, comparisons have been made between him and Kevin Garnett due to their similar style <b>of</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> physique.|$|E
5|$|In 1877, McGregor {{was invited}} to become a {{committee}} member of Aston Villa, a football club formed three years earlier. He also umpired matches for the club. At the time the club played at Aston Park, close to the premises of McGregor's business. He became interested in joining Villa due to the strong Scottish contingent in the club's ranks, the team's exciting style <b>of</b> <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> the club's connection to a Wesleyan Chapel. He quickly assumed the post of club administrator, helping the impecunious club to survive its financial troubles. After some of Aston Villa's possessions were seized by bailiffs, McGregor allowed the club to use his shop as a store to prevent further seizures. Under McGregor's leadership, Aston Villa won their first trophy, the Birmingham Senior Cup, in 1880, shortly after which McGregor became the club's president.|$|E

5|$|In {{comparison}} to dogs, cats have not undergone major changes during the domestication process, as {{the form and}} behavior of the domestic cat is not radically {{different from those of}} wildcats and domestic cats are perfectly capable of surviving in the wild. Fully domesticated house cats often interbreed with feral F. catus populations, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat. This limited evolution during domestication means that hybridisation can occur with many other felids, notably the Asian leopard cat. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have predisposed them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love <b>of</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> relatively high intelligence. Several small felid species may have an inborn tendency towards tameness.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{reviews of}} the title have been {{generally}} positive. Famitsu generally praised several aspects, but found the item management and weapon structures confusing, saying {{that it did not}} live up to the legacy of the Mana series. Reviewing the Vita port, Famitsu praised the game's general ease <b>of</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> use of the Mana series, but the button layout was criticized. Kyōsuke Takano of AppGet praised the gameplay and graphics, noting that the game avoided the possible pitfalls of being a mobile game while delivering a strong experience. His one point of reservation was that he would have preferred the game on another platform. 4Gamer.net praised the variety of control options, the feel of gameplay, and the graphics. The writer noted that the game should be played on more advanced mobiles despite recommendations, as the graphics and performance suffered on older smartphone models.|$|E
5|$|Jones was {{selected}} by the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) with the second pick in the 1946 NFL Draft, but did not sign with the team as he pondered returning to LSU to finish his studies. When the Miami Seahawks of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) offered him a $12,000 contract, however, he accepted it and joined the team. The Seahawks won just three games in 1946, the AAFC's first season <b>of</b> <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> Jones was traded along with two other players to the Brooklyn Dodgers, another AAFC team, in December. The Seahawks, meanwhile, folded and were moved to Baltimore after the season because of poor attendance and shaky finances. Jones played sparingly for the Dodgers {{in the last three}} games of the 1946 season, rushing for 62 yards on 19 carries.|$|E

He alienated local reporters by writing a column for the local paper during his time as coach of the Quebec Nordiques. His seminal work, Goaltending, was published in 1972 in English, with the French edition (entitled Devant le filet) published in 1973. In his book, Plante outlined a program of goaltender development that included off-ice exercises, choice of equipment, styles <b>of</b> <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> game-day preparation. He also advised on best coaching methods for both young and advanced goaltenders. His book remained popular with coaches and players and was reprinted in both French and English in 1997, 25years after it was first published.|$|E
5|$|Rapinoe is {{internationally known}} for her crafty style <b>of</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> her precise cross to Abby Wambach in the 122nd minute of the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup quarterfinals against Brazil, which {{resulted}} in an equalizer goal and eventual win for the Americans after a penalty kick shootout. The last-minute goal set a record for latest goal ever scored in a match and was awarded ESPN's 2011 ESPY Award for Best Play of the Year. During the 2012 London Olympics, she scored three goals and tallied a team-high four assists to lead the United States to a gold medal. She is the first player, male or female, to score a Goal Olimpico at the Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Storylines often {{centred on}} new signings who {{were unable to}} settle easily in the Melchester team, either because they refused to change their style <b>of</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> {{expected}} the Rovers to play around them, such as the uncomprisingly tough defender Duncan McKay, or had personal characteristics that {{made it difficult for}} the other players to accept them, such as ex-circus ball juggler Sammy Spangler. As the average reader probably stayed with the comic for only three or four years, many storylines were recycled. For instance, during the first ten years of his playing career Roy was kidnapped at least five times.|$|E
