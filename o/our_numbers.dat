We are the advance guard of a massive moral revolution that is not confined to the Negro, nor is it confined to civil rights, for our white allies know that they are not free while we are not.|$|E
25|$|We {{will never}} accept any global deal {{that does not}} limit global warming to the minimum {{unavoidable}} level, no matter what levels of compensation and assistance are promised to us… While we will reason with everyone to achieve our objective, we will not rubber stamp an agreement by {{the powers that be}} as the best we could get for the moment. We will use <b>our</b> <b>numbers</b> to delegitimize any agreement that is not consistent with our minimal position. If needs be we are prepared to walk out of any negotiations that threaten to be another rape of our continent.|$|E
500|$|With {{the filming}} and airing of [...] "Salvage", Robert Patrick {{began to feel}} [...] "comfortable in his new role". He later {{recalled}} that [...] "we started seeing our [...] numbers. <b>Our</b> <b>numbers</b> were good, and everyone was happy." [...] Several of the characters and locations were named or based after real individuals and places. The three scientists: Chamber, Clifton, and Pugovel, were named after friends of Bell's, [...] who were engineers. Much of the action was based in Muncie, Indiana. Bell picked this location {{because it was the}} hometown of his grandparents.|$|E

500|$|... "No Better" [...] is an electropop and trip hop ballad with hip hop elements. The song has {{a similar}} {{sonority}} {{to that of other}} songs from Pure Heroine, featuring Lorde's [...] "feathery" [...] vocals and minimal production. It incorporates [...] "woozy" [...] basslines, and [...] "pulsing" [...] synthesisers in its instrumentation, making the song's melody [...] "dreamy", according to Whitney Phaneuf of HitFix. Lyrically, the song features Lorde [...] " [...] an infatuation that deepens as the seasons change". At the first verse, she sings [...] "We roll in every summer when there's strength in <b>our</b> <b>numbers</b> / And your breath's hot and gross but I kiss you like a lover". During the chorus the bass beat becomes more intense as Lorde sings [...] "Go all the way / Have your fun, have it all".|$|E
500|$|Following the race, Mercedes apologised to Hamilton for the pit call, which {{commentators}} such as F1Fanatic's Keith Collantine, Formula One {{correspondent for}} The Guardian Paul Weaver, and former Formula One driver David Coulthard felt cost him the victory. Team boss Toto Wolff told the press: [...] "We got <b>our</b> <b>numbers</b> wrong. We {{thought we had}} the gap for Lewis to take fresh tyres and come back out in the lead behind the safety car, ahead of Nico and covering off any risk of another competitor taking fresh tyres. But the calculation was incorrect and he came out in third place." [...] Indeed, {{more than half of}} the teams made a pit stop at least one car when the safety car was deployed, just as Hamilton did. However, he as race leader caught up with the safety car quicker and lost a considerably larger amount of time on his way into the pit lane, leading to him coming out behind Rosberg and Vettel.|$|E
500|$|The series {{takes place}} in the year 2517, on a variety of planets and moons. The TV series does not reveal whether these {{celestial}} bodies are within one star system, only saying that Serenitys mode of propulsion is a [...] "gravity-drive". The film Serenity makes clear that all the planets and moons are in one large system, and production documents related to the film indicate that there is no faster-than-light travel in this universe. The characters occasionally refer to [...] "Earth-that-was", and the film establishes that, long before the events in the series, a large population had emigrated from Earth to a new star system in generation ships: [...] "Earth-that-was could no longer sustain <b>our</b> <b>numbers,</b> we were so many". The emigrants established themselves in this new star system, with [...] "dozens of planets and hundreds of moons". Many of these were terraformed, a process in which a planet or moon is altered to resemble Earth. The terraforming process was only the first step in making a planet habitable, however, and the outlying settlements often did not receive any further support in the construction of their civilizations. This resulted in many of the border planets and moons having forbidding, dry environments, well-suited to the Western genre.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The error-ranges of exact {{rational}} {{numbers and}} intervals can be guaranteed {{even during the}} arithmetic operations whereas we cannot rely on the error-ranges of floating-point numbers. In this paper, we propose a novel number system, where the exact rational numbers are strictly separated from inexact floating point numbers and carefully in-tegrated with the inexact numbers. A three-valued logic is also shipped with <b>our</b> <b>number</b> system to appropriately deal with uncertainties due to the inexactness. A prototype implementation of <b>our</b> <b>number</b> system in Python is demonstrated. ...|$|R
2500|$|Su Ze {{called for}} a meeting with Hao Zhao, Wei Ping, his {{subordinates}} and his Qiang allies to discuss {{how to deal with the}} rebellions. He told them: [...] "Although the rebels have superiority in numbers, they are nothing more than a motley crowd. As some of them have been forced to join the rebellion, they aren't necessarily as united as they seem. We should exploit their differences and make them split into 'good' and 'bad' camps. We shall then induce those in the 'good' camp to join us. This will boost <b>our</b> <b>numbers</b> and reduce theirs. Once we have increased <b>our</b> <b>numbers,</b> our morale will increase as well. By then, we should be able to defeat the rebels easily. If we do nothing now and wait for reinforcements to arrive, by then it'll be much more difficult to separate the rebels into 'good' and 'bad' camps and turn those in the 'good' camp to our side. Although we have no authorisation from the imperial court, given the current circumstances, I don't think it's unreasonable for us to exercise our own judgment and act accordingly." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{was under}} the {{impression}} that these Negro musicians would jump at the chance to patronize one of their own publishers. They didn't... The Negro musicians simply played the hits of the day...They followed the parade. Many white bands and orchestra leaders, on the other hand, were on the alert for novelties. They were therefore the ones most ready to introduce <b>our</b> <b>numbers.</b> [...] Negro vaudeville artists...wanted songs that would not conflict with white acts on the bill. The result was that these performers became our most effective pluggers.|$|E
2500|$|Borzou Daragahi Iraq {{correspondent}} for the Los Angeles Times, {{in an interview with}} PBS, questioned the study based on their earlier research in Iraq, saying, [...] "Well, we think—the Los Angeles Times thinks these numbers are too large, depending on the extensive research we've done. Earlier this year, around June, the report was published at least in June, but the reporting was done over weeks earlier. We went to morgues, cemeteries, hospitals, health officials, and we gathered as many statistics as we could on the actual dead bodies, and the number we came up with around June was about at least 50,000. And that kind of jibed with some of the news report that were out there, the accumulation of news reports, in terms of the numbers killed. The U.N. says that there's about 3,000 a month being killed; that also fits in with <b>our</b> <b>numbers</b> and with morgue numbers. This number of 600,000 or more killed {{since the beginning of the}} war, it's way off our charts." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a {{despatch}} to London Grey {{wrote that}} {{he had failed to}} shake the [...] "dogged determination" [...] of Māori on the Waitara question. [...] "A great part of the native race," [...] he wrote, [...] "may be stated to be at the present moment in arms, in a state of chronic discontent ... Large numbers of them have renounced the Queen's authority, and many of them declare openly that they have been so wronged that they will never return under it ... the great majority of them declare that if war arises from this cause, they will rise and make a simultaneous attack upon the several European settlements in the Northern Island. The reasons they urge for such proceedings are ... that the people of the Waitara, without having been guilty of any crime, were driven at the point of the sword from villages, houses, and homes which they had occupied for years. That a great crime had been committed against them. That through all future generations it will be told that their lands have been forcibly and unlawfully taken from them by officers appointed by the Queen of England. They argue that they have no hope of obtaining justice, that their eventual extermination is determined on; but that all that is left to them is to die like men, after a long and desperate struggle; and that the sooner they can bring that on before our preparations are further matured, and <b>our</b> <b>numbers</b> increased, the greater is their chance of success." ...|$|E
