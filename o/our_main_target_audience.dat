Methodology: The project is based on both primary and secondary information retrieved in connection with the theoretical framework. A qualitative approach of research and analysis has been considered to reach the desirable result. Theoretical Framework: The theoretical framework has been created with Porter’s (1998) five forces and National Diamond together with factors that influence the international entry strategy described by Franklin R (1998) Findings: While presenting the data, we have followed a structure. We have divided all our data in four parts. They are namely, The Focal Company Factors, Home country (Sweden) factors, the Focal country (Bangladesh) Factors, and the Focal country’s (Bangladesh) Telecom market factors. All data have been presented under the respective headings of these parts and also with some corresponding subheadings. Analysis: The analysis is based on the result of a consolidated evaluation of relevant theory and empirical information collected accordingly. All the collected information has been observed through the gloss of theoretical framework and has been used for answering the problem statement. Conclusion: After investigating the factors of Bangladesh telecom market, we can conclude that it will be a good idea for TeliaSonera to expand their business in Bangladesh as both the industry and the country has a lot of potential to offer. An Investment entry mode (Joint Venture) has been suggested. It is worth mentionable that this paper is a preliminary idea about the market to encourage TeliaSonera to expand in Bangladesh which reveals the opportunity for further research...|$|E
