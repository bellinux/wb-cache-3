5|$|Isopods have {{a simple}} gut which lacks a midgut section; instead there are caeca {{connected}} {{to the back of}} the stomach in which absorption takes place. Food is sucked into the esophagus, a process enhanced in the blood-sucking parasitic species, and passed by peristalsis into the stomach, where the material is processed and filtered. The structure of the stomach varies, but in many species there is a dorsal groove into which indigestible material is channelled and a ventral part connected to the caeca where intracellular digestion and absorption take place. Indigestible material passes <b>on</b> <b>through</b> the hindgut and is eliminated through the anus, which is on the pleotelson.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the direct effect of motivation, {{discipline}} to organizational commitment, and examine the effect of indirect motivation, discipline <b>on</b> performance <b>through</b> organizational commitment.

The research proves that there is a significant influence between motivation, organizational commitment and discipline to performance. While the indirect effect of motivation <b>on</b> performance <b>through</b> organizational commitment results obtained by (P 1 X P 3) = 0. 477 x 0. 159 = 0. 0758, whereas the indirect influence between disciplines working <b>on</b> performance <b>through</b> organizational commitment is equal to (P 2 x P 4) = 0. 186 x 0. 199 = 0. 0370.

5|$|After {{capturing}} the crater, Cherry pushed <b>on</b> <b>through</b> the village, where his party emerged {{from among the}} buildings on the far side. Another stiff fight ensured {{with a group of}} Germans in dug-outs {{by the side of the}} road, before the company was able to meet up with its fellow units which had bypassed the village and were already established to the north and east of the area. Cherry's orders were to fall back into reserve, but he disregarded them as he sensed a counter-attack was forthcoming. At 09:00 on 27 March, the Germans launched a very strong counter-attack under heavy artillery fire. At one point, Cherry noticed that the Germans were firing yellow flares to pinpoint Australian positions to their gunners. He found some of these flares, and fired them away from his position. The German attempts to retake Lagnicourt—at a cost to the 7th Brigade of 377 casualties—raged all day before they abandoned the counterattack.|$|E
