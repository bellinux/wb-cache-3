5|$|These attacks led the United States, Britain, China, Australia {{and several}} other states to {{formally}} declare war <b>on</b> <b>Japan,</b> whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan. Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt.|$|E

5|$|Allied forces {{conducted}} many {{air raids}} <b>on</b> <b>Japan</b> during World War II, causing extensive destruction to the country's cities and killing between 241,000 and 900,000 people. During {{the first years}} of the Pacific War these attacks were limited to the Doolittle Raid in April 1942 and small-scale raids on military positions in the Kuril Islands from mid-1943. Strategic bombing raids began in June 1944 and continued until the end of the war in August 1945. Allied naval and land-based tactical air units also attacked Japan during 1945.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Wilson was Chief of Development Engineering at United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) headquarters, {{and was the}} USAAF {{liaison officer}} to the Manhattan Project. In December 1944 he became Chief of Staff of the 316th Bombardment Wing. Its B-29s {{deployed}} to Okinawa in June 1945, and he participated in the last air raids <b>on</b> <b>Japan.</b> After the war ended {{he was involved in}} a survey of the damage done by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1947, {{he became one of the}} Deputy Chiefs of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project.|$|E
5|$|Following the Doolittle Raid, {{the next}} air attacks <b>on</b> <b>Japan</b> were made against the Kuril Islands in mid-1943. The liberation of Alaska's Attu Island in May 1943 during the Aleutian Islands Campaign {{provided}} the USAAF with bases {{within range of}} the Kurils. As part of the preparations for the liberation of Kiska Island in the Aleutians, the Eleventh Air Force {{conducted a series of}} raids against the Kurils to suppress the Japanese air units stationed there. The first of these attacks was made against southern Shumshu and northern Paramushiru by eight B-25s on 10July. The Kurils were attacked again on 18July by six B-24 Liberator heavy bombers, and the unopposed liberation of Kiska (Operation Cottage) took place on 15August.|$|E
5|$|German {{operations}} in the Atlantic also suffered. By May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly effective, the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign. In November 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran. The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory and the military planning for the Burma Campaign, while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war <b>on</b> <b>Japan</b> within three months of Germany's defeat.|$|E

5|$|Groves {{expected}} to have another atomic bomb ready for use on 19 August, with three more in September and a further three in October. Two more Fat Man assemblies were readied, and scheduled to leave Kirtland Field for Tinian on 11 and 14 August. At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast another plutonium core. Although cast, it still needed to be pressed and coated, which would take until 16 August. It could therefore have been ready for use on 19 August. On 10 August, Truman secretly requested that additional atomic bombs not be dropped <b>on</b> <b>Japan</b> without his express authority. Groves suspended the third core's shipment on his own authority on 13 August.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Sakurai {{confirmed}} {{that he was}} working on a new game through Project Sora. Uprising was officially announced at the 2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo alongside the announcement of the 3DS. In an interview closer to release, Sakurai said that he had misgivings about Uprising being shown off at gaming expos since 2010 while it was still in an unfinished state. As announced in 2011, the game suffered a delay that pushed its release into 2012. In January 2012, Sakurai announced via his Twitter feed that the game had gone gold. The game released <b>on</b> <b>Japan</b> on 22 March 2012; in Europe and North America on 23 March; and in Australia on 29 March. The game's box art was almost identical between its Japanese and English releases.|$|E
5|$|In August, the Japanese {{government}} refused surrender demands as specifically {{outlined in}} the Potsdam Declaration. With the invasion of mainland Japan imminent, Truman approved the schedule for dropping the two available bombs. Truman always said that attacking Japan with atomic bombs saved many lives on both sides; military estimates for the invasion of mainland Japan were that it could take a year and result in 250,000 to 500,000 American casualties. Hiroshima was bombed on August 6, and Nagasaki three days later, leaving 105,000 dead. The Soviet Union declared war <b>on</b> <b>Japan</b> on August 9 and invaded Manchuria. Japan agreed to surrender the following day.|$|E

5|$|In January 1945, XXBomber Command began {{preparations}} to redeploy to the Mariana Islands. The Command ceased its attacks <b>on</b> <b>Japan</b> and East Asia, {{for which}} it used bases in China to refuel the B-29s en route to their targets, and instead focused on targets in Southeast Asia that could be reached from Kharagpur. As there were few industrial targets within range of Kharagpur, the highest priority was given to attacking shipping in major ports such as Rangoon, Bangkok and Singapore as well as smaller harbours. Attacks were conducted through both conventional bombing and laying naval mines. As part of the transition, LeMay departed for the Mariana Islands on 18 January {{and was replaced by}} Brigadier General Roger M. Ramsey.|$|E
5|$|In October 1943, General Hansell was {{appointed}} {{chief of the}} Combined and Joint Staff Division, in the Office of the Assistant Chief of Air Staff for Plans, located at Headquarters USAAF. As such he became Air Planner on the Joint Planning Staff. He immediately affected planning of strategic air attacks <b>on</b> <b>Japan.</b> The JPS draft outline denigrated strategic bombing and declared that an invasion of the home islands was {{the only means of}} defeating Japan, but Hansell successfully argued that an invasion should only be a contingency if bombing and a sea blockade of Japan failed to compel a surrender.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{before and after the}} first {{demonstration}} of a nuclear weapon, the Trinity test in July 1945, his fellow Hungarian Leo Szilard circulated the Szilard petition, which argued that a demonstration to the Japanese of the new weapon should occur prior to actual use <b>on</b> <b>Japan,</b> and with that hopefully the weapons would never be used on people. In response to Szilard's petition, Teller consulted his friend Robert Oppenheimer. Teller believed that Oppenheimer was a natural leader and could help him with such a formidable political problem. Oppenheimer reassured Teller that the nation's fate should be left to the sensible politicians in Washington. Bolstered by Oppenheimer's influence, he decided to not sign the petition.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{in early}} August, Duke of York was {{assigned}} to Task Force 37, along with four aircraft carriers and her sister-ship King George V. From 9 August, TF 37 and three American carrier task forces {{conducted a series of}} air raids <b>on</b> <b>Japan,</b> which continued until 15 August when a surrender came into effect. After the conclusion of hostilities, Duke of York, alongside her sister-ship, King George V, participated in the surrender ceremonies that took place in Tokyo Bay. The following month Duke of York sailed for Hong Kong, to join the fleet that assembled there to accept the surrender of the Japanese garrison. She was the flagship of the British Pacific Fleet when the Japanese surrendered, and remained so until June 1946, when she returned to Plymouth for an overhaul.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1944 a United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) F-13 Superfortress {{conducted}} {{the first flight}} by an Allied aircraft over the Tokyo region of Japan since the Doolittle Raid in April 1942. This photo reconnaissance sortie was highly successful, with the aircraft's crew taking thousands of photographs which were later used to plan many air raids <b>on</b> <b>Japan</b> during the final months of World War II. Attempts by Japanese air units and anti-aircraft gun batteries to destroy the F-13 failed, as the available fighter aircraft and guns could not reach the high altitude it operated at.|$|E
