40|$|In {{this work}} we study {{a set of}} tilt grain {{boundaries}} (GB) with a misorientation angle varied from 26 º to 141 º by applying atomistic calculations in α-Fe. A set of different interatomic potentials was used to deduce the most energetically favourable configurations, the gamma surface profile and sliding pathway. The uniaxial loading tests were performed by pulling apart two grains to calculate the separation energy profile, cleavage stress and to study the process <b>of</b> the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> free surfaces during the simulated cleavage fracture. We show that the resistance of a grain boundary to slide {{is closely related to}} its structure. The results of the loading tests have shown that the cleavage fracture process may involve: (i) reconstruction <b>of</b> the surface and/or <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> two <b>non-equivalent</b> open surfaces; (ii) movement of the grain boundary front, which involves sliding and thus allows to accommodate the applied strain by plastic deformation.
