25|$|The Naassenes {{had one or}} {{more books}} out of which Hippolytus of Rome largely quotes in the Philosophumena, which professed to contain heads of discourses communicated by James, the brother of Jesus, to Mariamne. They {{contained}} treatises of a mystical, philosophic, devotional, and exegetical character, rather than a cosmological exposition. A very interesting feature of the book {{seems to have been}} the specimens it gave of <b>Ophite</b> hymnology.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the myths}} {{of the earlier}} <b>Ophite</b> system are but lightly touched on, there is some trace of an {{acquaintance}} with them, as for example the myth that Adam was brought forth by the Earth spontaneously; he lay without breath, without motion, without stirring, like a statue; being made after {{the image of the}} First Man, through the agency of several Archons. In order for them to seize hold of the First Man, there was given unto Adam a soul, that through this soul the image of the First Man above might suffer and be chastened in bondage.|$|E
5000|$|Pseudo-Tertullian (probably the Latin {{translation}} of the lost work Syntagma of Hippolytus, written c. 220) is the earliest source to mention <b>Ophites,</b> and the first source to discuss the connection with serpents. He claims (Haer. 2.1-4) that the <b>Ophites</b> taught that ...|$|R

50|$|Origen (c. 185-254) is led {{to speak}} of the <b>Ophites</b> (Contra Celsum 6:28) by an {{accusation}} of Celsus that the Christians counted seven heavens, and spoke of the Creator as an accursed divinity, inasmuch as he was worthy of execration for cursing the serpent who introduced the first human beings to the knowledge of good and evil. Origen replies that Celsus had mixed up matters, and had confounded with the Christians the <b>Ophites,</b> who so far from being Christians would not hear the name of Jesus, nor own him to have been so much as a wise and virtuous man, nor would admit anyone into their assembly until he had cursed Jesus. It may be doubted whether Origen has not here been misinformed about a sect of which he intimates that he knows but little. According to all other authorities the <b>Ophites</b> claimed to be Christians. Elsewhere Origen classes the <b>Ophites</b> as heretics of the graver sort with the followers of Marcion, Valentinus, Basilides, and Apelles (Commentary on Matthew 3:852). The identity of the nomenclature shows that for Origen, these <b>Ophites</b> of Origen are a branch of the unnamed sect described by Irenaeus.|$|R
25|$|In 1969 a Satanic {{group based}} in Toledo, Ohio, part of the United States, came to public attention. Called the Our Lady of Endor Coven, it was led {{by a man named}} Herbert Sloane, who {{described}} his Satanic tradition as the <b>Ophite</b> Cultus Satanas and alleged that it had been established in the 1940s. The group offered a Gnostic interpretation {{of the world in which}} the creator God was regarded as evil and the Biblical Serpent presented as a force for good who had delivered salvation to humanity in the Garden of Eden. Sloane's claims that his group had a 1940s origin remain unproven; it may be that he falsely claimed older origins for his group to make it appear older than Anton LaVey's Church of Satan which had been established in 1966.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the system}} of Valentinus (...) Ennoea {{is one of several}} {{alternative}} names for the consort of the primary Aeon Bythos.

2500|$|Organized groups {{began to}} emerge in the mid 20th century, {{including}} the <b>Ophite</b> Cultus Satanas (1948) and The Church of Satan (1966). [...] After seeing Margaret Murray's book The God of the Witches the leader of <b>Ophite</b> Cultus Satanas, Herbert Arthur Sloane, said he realized that the horned god was Satan (Sathanas). Sloane also corresponded with his contemporary Gerald Gardner, founder of the Wicca religion, and implied that his views of Satan and the horned god were not necessarily in conflict with Gardner's approach. However, he did believe that, while [...] "gnosis" [...] referred to knowledge, and [...] "Wicca" [...] referred to wisdom, modern witches had fallen away from the true knowledge, and instead had begun worshipping a fertility god, a reflection of the creator god. He wrote that [...] "the largest existing body of witches who are true Satanists would be the Yezedees". Sloane highly recommended the book The Gnostic Religion, and sections of it were sometimes read at ceremonies. It was estimated that there were up to 100,000 Satanists worldwide by 2006, twice the number estimated in 1990. Satanistic beliefs have been largely permitted as a valid expression of religious belief in the West. For example, they were allowed in the British Royal Navy in 2004, [...] and an appeal was considered in 2005 for religious status as a right of prisoners by the Supreme Court of the United States. Contemporary Satanism is mainly an American phenomenon, although it began to reach Eastern Europe in the 1990s {{around the time of the}} fall of the Soviet Union.|$|E

2500|$|Charis, in {{the system}} of Valentinus, was an {{alternative}} name, with Ennoea and Sige, for the consort of the primary Aeon Bythos (...) [...] The name expresses that aspect of the absolute Greatness {{in which it is}} regarded not as a solitary monad, but as imparting from its perfection to beings of which it is the ultimate source; and this is the explanation given in the Valentinian fragment preserved by Epiphanius (Haer. xxxi. 6), dia to epikechoregekenai auten thesaurismata tou Megethous tois ek tou Megethous. The use of the word Charis enabled Ptolemaeus (quoted by [...] ) to find in [...] the first tetrad of Aeons, viz., Pater, Monogenes, Charis, Aletheia. The suspicion arises that it was with a view to such an identification that names {{to be found in the}} prologue of St. John's Gospel were added as alternative appellations to the original names of the Aeons. But this is a point on which we have no data to pronounce. Charis has an important place {{in the system}} of Marcus (...) [...] The name Charis appears also in the system of the Barbelitae (...) , but as denoting a later emanation than in the Valentinian system. The word has possibly also a technical meaning in the <b>Ophite</b> prayers preserved by Origen (...) , all of which end with the invocation he charis synesto moi, nai pater, synesto.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} verifiable theistic Satanist {{group was}} a small group called the <b>Ophite</b> Cultus Satanas, which was created in Ohio in 1948. The <b>Ophite</b> Cultus Satanas {{was inspired by the}} ancient <b>Ophite</b> sect of Gnosticism, and the horned god of Wicca. The group was dependent upon its founder and leader, and therefore dissolved after his death in 1975.|$|E

Both basic igneous manifestations suffered very low- to low-grade metamorphism, more intense {{in the case of}} the <b>ophites.</b> Two types of <b>ophites</b> are distinguished on the basis of their primary mineralogy. In the first type, orthopyroxene is present in the less differentiated products. Clinopyroxene and Ca-plagioclase are the main primary phases and quartz appears in the more evolved rocks. In the second type, olivine is present in the less differentiated products. Ti-rich augite and Ca-plagioclase are also important primary minerals, but quartz is absent. Whole-rock chemistry (major and trace elements, including REE) also allows us to discriminate between these two groups. The first group has higher SiOz and lower TiOz, PzOs and lower NazO/KzO ratios than the second.

5000|$|The Sethians (Latin Sethoitae) {{are first}} mentioned, {{alongside}} the <b>Ophites,</b> in the 2nd century, by Irenaeus and in Pseudo-Tertullian (Ch.30).

5000|$|The name [...] "Jesus" [...] is not {{mentioned}} in the account. Epiphanius' account differs from that of Pseudo-Tertullian only in a few places.

50|$|Although, {{following}} Theodoret, we {{have given}} the name <b>Ophite</b> to the system described by Irenaeus, it will have been seen that the doctrine concerning the serpent forms a very subordinate part of the system. In the passage immediately following the chapter we have analysed, Irenaeus shows acquaintance with {{a section of the}} school who may be called <b>Ophite</b> in the proper sense of the word, some teaching that Sophia herself was the serpent, some glorifying Cain and other enemies of the God of the Old Testament.|$|E
5000|$|In the <b>Ophite</b> and Sethian systems, {{which have}} many affinities with that last {{mentioned}} , {{the making of}} the world is ascribed to a company of seven archons, whose names are given, but their chief, [...] "Yaldabaoth" [...] (also known as [...] "Yaltabaoth" [...] or [...] "Ialdabaoth") comes into still greater prominence.|$|E
25|$|According to Origen's Contra Celsum, a sect {{called the}} <b>Ophites</b> posited the {{existence}} of seven archons, beginning with Iadabaoth or Ialdabaoth, who created the six that follow: Iao, Sabaoth, Adonaios, Elaios, Astaphanos, and Horaios. Similarly to the Mithraic Kronos and Vedic Narasimha, a form of Vishnu, Ialdabaoth had a head of a lion.|$|R
25|$|According to Smith, Sethianism {{may have}} begun as a pre-Christian tradition, {{possibly}} a syncretic cult that incorporated elements of Christianity and Platonism as it grew.

50|$|Again, {{beside the}} higher hebdomad {{of the seven}} archons, the <b>Ophite</b> system told of a lower hebdomad. After the serpent in {{punishment}} for having taught the first parents to transgress the commands of Ialdabaoth was cast down into this lower world, he begat himself six sons, who with himself form a hebdomad, the counterpart of that of which his father Ialdabaoth is chief. These are the seven demons, the scene of whose activity is this lower earth, not the heavens; and who delight in injuring the human race on whose account their father had been cast down. Origen (Adv. Cels. 30) gives their names and forms from an <b>Ophite</b> diagram; Michael in form as a lion, Suriel as an ox, Raphael as a dragon, Gabriel as an eagle, Thauthabaoth as a bear, Erataoth as a dog, Onoel or Thartharaoth as an ass.|$|E
50|$|Herbert Arthur Sloane was {{the first}} person known to have {{organized}} and led a specifically Satanic religious group. Its name was the <b>Ophite</b> Cultus Sathanas. Sloane -- a World War II U. S. Army veteran, barber, Spiritualist minister, numerologist, card and tea leaf reader, hypnotist, and evidentiary medium -- formed the group in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1948, and also headed his own local branch of the organization, Our Lady of Endor Coven. As Sloane changed location, the headquarters of the <b>Ophite</b> Cultus Sathanas relocated with him, first to Mishawaka and South Bend, Indiana in the 1950s, and then to Toledo, Ohio in the 1960s, where it remained until Sloane's death in 1975. It is estimated that membership in his group numbered fewer than a dozen people at any given time; according to one contemporary account there were five local members.|$|E
50|$|In the Gnostic system {{described}} by Irenaeus (I. xxi.; see Ophites) the name Prunikos several times takes {{the place of}} Sophia in the relation of her story. The name Prunikos is also given to Sophia in the account of the kindred Barbeliot system, given in the preceding chapter of Irenaeus. Celsus, who shows that he had met with some <b>Ophite</b> work, exhibits acquaintance with the name Prunikos (Orig. Adv. Cels. vi. 34) a name which Origen recognizes as Valentinian. That this <b>Ophite</b> name had really been adopted by the Valentinians is evidenced by its occurrence in a Valentinian fragment preserved by Epiphanius (Epiph. Haer. xxxi. 5). Epiphanius also introduces Prunikos as a technical word in the system of the Simonians (Epiph. Haer. xxi. 2) of those whom he describes under the head of Nicolaitans (Epiph. Haer. xxv. 3, 4) and of the Ophites (Epiph. Haer. xxxvii. 4, 6).|$|E

2500|$|Instead, however, of {{retaining}} the female {{principle of the}} Syrian <b>Ophites,</b> they represented their [...] "Man" [...] as androgynous; and hence one of their hymns runs [...] "From thee, father, through thee, mother, the two immortal names."
