5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was based}} around {{the concept of}} five different races, and the interaction with a human character. The story premise <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> character becoming {{a member of one}} of the five playable races was born out of a compromise about who and what the player character should be. The concept of a non-human character was introduced by Horii as he saw an inherent contradiction in the idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> saving the other tribes. This raised some contention among the staff including Fujisawa due to the Dragon Quest series' established convention <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> as the main protagonist, but Fujisawa and Horii decided to have the player character be a human first and later become one of the five tribes. Part of the story's initial drama came from the player character growing accustomed to their new form. Once the basic scenario concept had been finalized, the team commissioned the various character designs from Toriyama. In contrast to the greater majority of MMORPGs, which did not seem to have a solid ending, the team wanted to create a definitive ending with a final boss as featured in normal RPGs.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Szilard {{switched}} to biology. He invented the chemostat, discovered feedback inhibition, and {{was involved in}} the first cloning <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> cell. He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted thermonuclear bombs, a new kind of nuclear weapon that might annihilate mankind. Diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1960, he underwent treatment using a cobalt-60 treatment that he had designed. He helped found the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he became a resident fellow. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver “the sweet voice of reason” about nuclear weapons to Congress, the White House, and the American public. He died in his sleep {{of a heart attack in}} 1964.|$|E

5|$|An {{elephant}} uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting {{its skin}} from ultraviolet light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular mud baths {{to protect it}} from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human.</b> They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{was viewed}} as a potent source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E

5|$|Folk {{tales and}} myths {{sometimes}} contain mythological hybrids; the Minotaur was the offspring <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human,</b> Pasiphaë, {{and a white}} bull. More often, they are composites of the physical attributes {{of two or more}} kinds of animals, mythical beasts, and humans, with no suggestion that they are the result of interbreeding, as in the centaur (man/horse), chimera (goat/lion/snake), hippocamp (fish/horse), and sphinx (woman/lion). The Old Testament mentions a first generation of half-human hybrid giants, the Nephilim, while the apocryphal Book of Enoch describes the Nephilim as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.|$|E
5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus, {{the ancient}} Greek historian, {{documented}} women carrying large phallic shaped monuments and ornaments the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> body in villages in ancient Dionysia. On {{the island of}} Delos a pillar supports a colossal phallus, the symbol of Dionysus. Phallus reliefs on buildings on such sites are also {{believed to have been}} apotropaic devices to ward off evil. The elaborate use of phallic architecture and sculpture in ancient Greek society can also be seen in sites such as Nea Nikomedeia in northern Greece. Archaeologists excavating the ancient town discovered clay sculptures of plump women with phallic heads and folded arms.|$|E
