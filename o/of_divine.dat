5|$|In Hymns <b>of</b> <b>Divine</b> Love (also called Hymns <b>of</b> <b>Divine</b> Eros) most {{of which}} were {{completed}} during his time in exile, Symeon describes his vision of God as uncreated divine light. That experience <b>of</b> <b>divine</b> luminosity is associated by Symeon with the Holy Trinity, with God, and sometimes with Christ. The Hymns are similar in theme to the Discourses, but are written with poetic meter and rhyme. He began writing them {{at the same time as}} the Discourses but only finished editing them during the last thirteen years of his life at the monastery of St. Macrina. There are 58 hymns totaling approximately 11,000 verses.|$|E

5|$|The medieval {{doctrine}} <b>of</b> <b>divine</b> simplicity also poses {{problems for}} religious language. This suggests that God has no accidental properties– these are properties that a being can have {{which do not}} contribute to its essence. If God has no accidental properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as goodness are accidental. If divine simplicity is accepted, then to describe God as good would entail that goodness and God have the same definition. Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the Bible regularly ascribes different emotions to God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>divine</b> simplicity.|$|E

5|$|The {{canonical}} {{texts are}} {{the writings of}} the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, and the authenticated talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá. The writings of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh are considered as divine revelation, the writings and talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá and the writings of Shoghi Effendi as authoritative interpretation, and those of the Universal House of Justice as authoritative legislation and elucidation. Some measure <b>of</b> <b>divine</b> guidance is assumed for all of these texts. Some of Bahá'u'lláh's most important writings include the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, literally the Most Holy Book, which defines many laws and practices for individuals and society, the Kitáb-i-Íqán, literally the Book of Certitude, which became the foundation of much of Bahá'í belief, the Gems <b>of</b> <b>Divine</b> Mysteries, which includes further doctrinal foundations, and the Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys which are mystical treatises.|$|E
5|$|The {{repulsion}} of the Arab {{assault on}} Nicaea {{was an important}} success for the Byzantines. Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717–741) regarded the city's survival as a sign <b>of</b> <b>divine</b> favour towards his newly instituted iconoclastic policies, and was encouraged to drive them further. This is probably related to an incident mentioned {{in the account of}} Theophanes, where a certain Constantine, who served as a groom (strator) to Artabasdos, threw a stone on an icon of the Virgin Mary and then trampled on it. The soldier was killed the next day by a catapult, a fact which Theophanes reports as evidence <b>of</b> <b>divine</b> vengeance. However, this passage shows strong signs of tampering by the fervently anti-iconoclast Theophanes, from what was probably originally a pro-iconoclast story.|$|E
5|$|Various forms <b>of</b> <b>divine</b> command theory {{have been}} {{presented}} by philosophers including William of Ockham, St Augustine, Duns Scotus, and John Calvin. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of God and that morality is determined by divine commands. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God's command is {{the only reason that}} a good action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason. The theory asserts that good actions are morally good {{as a result of their}} being commanded by God, and many religious believers subscribe to some form <b>of</b> <b>divine</b> command theory. Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God's commands; what is morally right is what God desires.|$|E

5|$|With {{the rise}} of nation-states and the Protestant Reformation, the theory <b>of</b> <b>divine</b> right {{justified}} the king's absolute authority in both political and spiritual matters.

Louis XIV of France (1643–1715) strongly promoted the theory as well.|$|E
5|$|A folk {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's death. Ramprasad was very fond of taking part in Kali puja {{on the night of}} Diwali, the festival of lights. On one Kali puja night, he {{performed}} the puja and sang throughout the night. In the morning, Ramprasad carried the jar <b>of</b> <b>Divine</b> Mother's sanctified water on his head to the Ganges. He was followed by the devotees, who carried the clay image of Kali to be immersed in the Ganges after the night of worship. Ramprasad waded into the holy river, until the water was neck deep, all the while singing for Kali. As Kali's image was immersed, Ramprasad died— this was believed to be around 1775.|$|E
5|$|A similar tale <b>of</b> <b>divine</b> {{seduction}} {{appears in}} Greek mythology, where Zeus, a king-of-the-gods figure akin to Indra, seduces Alcmene by assuming {{the form of}} her husband, resulting in {{the birth of the}} legendary hero Heracles. Like Ahalya, Alcmene falls victim to Zeus's trickery in some versions or, recognising his true identity, proceeds with the affair in others. The main difference between the tales is that the raison-d'être of Alcmene's seduction is the justification of Heracles's divine parentage, so she is never condemned as an adulteress or punished; in contrast, Ahalya faces the ire of the scriptures as her encounter is regarded as purely erotic (not resulting in procreation).|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh wrote many books, tablets and prayers, {{of which}} only a {{fraction}} have been translated into English.

5|$|Because {{evolutionary}} naturalism proposes {{an empirical}} account of morality, {{it does not}} require morality to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead to moral scepticism or antirealism. C. S. Lewis argued that, if evolutionary naturalism is accepted, human morality cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right or wrong. Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent. As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form <b>of</b> <b>divine</b> command theory which equated God with goodness and treated goodness as an essential part of reality, thus asserting God's existence.|$|E
5|$|By 829, {{when the}} young emperor Theophilos ascended the Byzantine throne, the Byzantines and Arabs had been {{fighting}} {{on and off for}} almost two centuries. At this time, Arab attacks resumed both in the east, where after almost twenty years of peace due to the Abbasid civil war Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) launched several large-scale raids, and in the west, where the gradual Muslim conquest of Sicily was under way since 827. Theophilos was an ambitious man and also a convinced adherent of Byzantine Iconoclasm, which prohibited the depiction <b>of</b> <b>divine</b> figures and the veneration of icons. He sought to bolster his regime and support his religious policies by military success against the Abbasid Caliphate, the Empire's major antagonist.|$|E
