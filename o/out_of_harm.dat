40|$|This {{presentation}} {{discusses the}} pros and cons of using various Automated Flagger Assistance Devices (AFADs). It reviews both AFADs using STOP/SLOW signs which are currently allowed in Indiana, and Red/Yellow signal faced AFADs that are not allowed in Indiana. The presentation points out that the principle reason for developing AFADs was to enhance worker safety by enabling flagger/operators to position themselves <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>harm</b> 2 ̆ 7 s way while controlling work zone traffic. However, the dominant reason for buying them seems to be to save money by only using one flagger/operator. Various applications using AFADs are reviewed as well as potential changes to the MUTCD regarding AFADs...|$|E
40|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} forms a cocoon {{that surrounds the}} cellular genome keeping it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>harm</b> 2 ̆ 7 s way and can be utilized by the cell {{as a means of}} functionally regulating chromatin structure and gene expression. At the same time, this double-layered membrane system constitutes a formidable obstacle to the unimpeded flow of genetic information between the genome {{and the rest of the}} cell. The nuclear pore has been long considered the sole passageway between nucleus and cytoplasm. A new report challenges this view and proposes a novel mechanism by which RNA transcripts destined for localized translation in highly polarized cell types, cross both inner and outer {{nuclear envelope}} membranes and reach the cytoplasm without utilizing the nuclear pore route...|$|E
