5|$|In {{addition}} to the main Victorian rail network of the Victorian Railways and successors, a number of narrow gauge private railways and tramways have also existed for logging and mining purposes. These included the Yallourn 900mm Railway in the Latrobe Valley <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> coal mines, the Fyansford Cement Works Railway near Geelong, the Tyers Valley Tramway at Mount Baw Baw, and the Powelltown Tramway from Yarra Junction.|$|E
5|$|The IRT Flushing Line {{would be}} {{extended}} from Main Street to Bell Boulevard, as a two-track and a four-track line, along Roosevelt Avenue. The line would be constructed in a tunnel, embankment, and an <b>open</b> <b>cut,</b> costing $12,070,000. An additional extension would be constructed to College Point, running along 149th Street and 11th Avenue as an elevated line from Roosevelt Avenue to 122nd Street, costing $14,100,000.|$|E
5|$|Beyond West Brighton near a NYCDEP water {{pollution}} control facility, the line rose onto a reinforced concrete trestle {{known as the}} Port Richmond Viaduct, crossing Bodine Creek and running for about a mile through the Port Richmond neighborhood. West of Nicholas Avenue near Port Richmond High School, the line entered an <b>open</b> <b>cut,</b> crossing under the Bayonne Bridge approach and continued west to the Arlington Yard and station at South Avenue. Rapid transit service continued via a northern spur to Port Ivory; freight service passed the current Howland Hook Marine Terminal (adjacent to Port Ivory) and crossed the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge to Cranford Junction in New Jersey. The right-of-way from the Port Richmond Viaduct to Arlington Yard has remained intact and in good condition, though the former station sites and infrastructure are dilapidated and need rehabilitation or replacement should passenger service be reactivated.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the copper}} was {{for sale to}} India as it was taking {{over a third of}} world copper supply in the mid-19th century. Due to the lack of {{smelting}} in South Australia, copper ore was initially shipped to Cornwall. The company purchased a Cornish beam engine which was the first in Australia when erected in 1848. Due to the uneconomic state of the mine, in 1868 a decision made to <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> the mine. Mining ceased underground, having reached a depth of 183metres(600ft) and open-cut operations starting in 1870 although, over the remaining life of the mine, small underground operations extracted more ore than the expensive <b>open</b> <b>cut.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{health effects}} {{discovered}} from radon exposure in unventilated uranium mining prompted the switch away from uranium mining via tunnel underground mining towards <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> and In-situ leaching technology, {{a method of}} extraction that does not produce the same occupational hazards, or mine tailings, as conventional mining.|$|E
25|$|In 1875, {{the line}} was grade-separated and put in an <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> and a viaduct between Grand Central and the Harlem River to reduce {{the loss of life}} and to {{increase}} speeds. The work was completed for $6,000,000, of which half was paid by the city.|$|E
25|$|Coal mining has {{had many}} {{developments}} over the recent years, {{from the early}} days of men tunnelling, digging and manually extracting the coal on carts, to large <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> and long wall mines. Mining at this scale requires the use of draglines, trucks, conveyors, hydraulic jacks and shearers.|$|E
50|$|Kelly {{defeated}} Troy Mandaloniz at UFC 95. Kelly battered Mandaloniz {{from top}} position throughout the fight. He <b>opened</b> <b>cuts</b> above both of Mandaloniz's eyes with elbows and punches. The judges scored the fight (30-27, 30-27, 30-28) for a unanimous decision for Kelly.|$|R
50|$|The design {{standards}} specified a minimum {{impact on the}} land. The vehicle tunnels were often constructed to reduce excessive landscape scarring that <b>open</b> <b>cuts</b> would have produced. They are used in areas of steep terrain where ridges run perpendicular to the roadway alignment.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{swimming}} {{or working}} in affected areas {{can lead to}} infections of the eyes, ears, or <b>open</b> <b>cuts</b> and wounds.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, MIM built an SX–EW plant at Mount Isa to recover copper leached from {{low grade ore}} stockpiled while mining its Black Rock <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> in the 1960s. In a world first, a Jameson Cell was used to clean the {{electrolyte}} solution by removing the remaining organic solvent. This replaced the sand filters traditionally used.|$|E
25|$|Though {{this part}} of the route is on the {{alignment}} of the 1878 <b>open</b> <b>cut,</b> it was rebuilt in 1918 to 1920 to a four track line with an express station at Prospect Park, a local station at Parkside Avenue (replacing the original station at Woodruff Avenue) and another express station at Church Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Several {{options were}} considered, {{including}} dualization of the tunnels, addition of two lanes {{through a large}} road cut in the mountain, leaving the other two lanes in the tunnel, and replacement of the entire tunnel with an <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> to the north. Citing the high maintenance costs of a tunnel, the replacement option was ultimately chosen.|$|E
50|$|A {{slurry wall}} is a civil {{engineering}} technique used to build reinforced concrete walls in areas of soft earth close to open water, or with a high groundwater table. This technique is typically used to build diaphragm (water-blocking) walls surrounding tunnels and <b>open</b> <b>cuts,</b> and to lay foundations.|$|R

25|$|This {{decision}} {{resulted in}} around one kilometre (1,100 yards) of existing railway (including the tunnel itself) being abandoned {{and replaced by}} a new section of line constructed in <b>open</b> <b>cut,</b> somewhat {{to the west of}} the original course. The operation to reopen the railway took five months of round-the-clock working. The portals of the collapsed tunnel were sealed to prevent further access.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, {{there was}} a {{proposal}} to renovate the Sea Beach <b>open</b> <b>cut,</b> which were deteriorating {{to the point that}} a retaining wall along the line was in danger of collapsing onto the tracks. Funding was allocated for the line's infrastructure improvements in 1975. More than $20 million was earmarked for New York City Subway projects in 1977, including for upgrades to the Sea Beach line.|$|E

25|$|Until 1860 {{the mine}} {{was the largest}} metals mine in Australia. From 1845 to 1877 the mine {{produced}} approximately 50,000 tonnes of copper. The mine was reopened as a modern <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> in 1971, operating for a decade with 24,000 tonnes of copper extracted. The mine's Adelaide operation was run by Henry Ayers, secretary of SAMA, from its opening until the 1890s. Henry Roach was chief Captain, responsible for day-to-day operations, from 1847 to 1867.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} Dual Contracts, {{and while}} the Fourth Avenue Subway Line was being {{constructed}} the BRT dug a four-track <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> and built high-level platforms for subway operation on the Sea Beach Line. Trolley cars started using the new <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> between Avenue T and 86th Street on January 9, 1914. Service was gradually extended until the new Sea Beach Line opened for full subway service. Two subway cars with poles were run between Third Avenue and New Utrecht Avenue and started operating on March 16, 1915. Additional cars were equipped with poles and operated service {{on the line from}} May 1, 1915 until the line opened for full subway service on June 22, 1915, with trains running between Coney Island and Chambers Street in Lower Manhattan. Service started with two- and three-car trains operating via the Fourth Avenue local track and the Manhattan Bridge south tracks. The express tracks were finished several weeks later. When the BMT Fourth Avenue Line was extended south from the Sea Beach Line on January 15, 1916, the Sea Beach trains were shifted to the express tracks on Fourth Avenue, with Fourth Avenue trains providing local service.|$|E
25|$|The Brooklyn, Flatbush, and Coney Island Railway, or Brighton Line, was {{incorporated}} in 1877 {{in order to}} connect Downtown Brooklyn with the hotels and resorts at Coney Island, Manhattan Beach, and Brighton Beach. The line opened on June 2, 1878, originally running from the entrance of Prospect Park to the Brighton Beach Hotel. However, the railroad desired to get the line closer to downtown Brooklyn. There was a problem–the line could not pass through Prospect Park as this was before subway started {{to be built in}} New York, and therefore the line was to be built in a trench through the hill at Crown Heights, connecting with the Long Island Rail Road tracks at Atlantic Avenue. The route, was built on the surface between Atlantic Avenue (Bedford Terminal) and Park Place. The line was then built in an <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> {{to the rest of the}} line at Prospect Park in order to avoid grade crossings and anger from the local community. This portion of the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway's mainline would become the Franklin Avenue Line. Later on, in order to accommodate larger locomotives for LIRR through service, the <b>open</b> <b>cut</b> had to be dug deeper.|$|E
50|$|Many onsens display notices {{reminding}} {{anyone with}} <b>open</b> <b>cuts,</b> sores, or lesions not to bathe. Additionally, {{in recent years}} onsens are increasingly adding chlorine to their waters to prevent infection, although many onsen purists seek natural, unchlorinated onsens that do not recycle their water but instead clean the baths daily. These precautions as well as proper onsen usage (i.e. not placing the head underwater, washing thoroughly before entering the bath) greatly reduce any overall risk to bathers.|$|R
