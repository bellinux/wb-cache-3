We'd just {{released}} <b>our</b> <b>second</b> album overseas on an independent label; and, spent time in America as an independent act.

25|$|While Duke University’s {{reputation}} grew as {{a national}} educational institution, its attitudes towards black workers remained unchanged. The same year the Duke Employees Benevolent Society was established in 1965, Duke revealed a new $200 million plan to promote Duke’s status as a top national university. The funds were used to advance the renovation of new libraries, science research labs, and more modern facilities. Despite Duke University’s reputation as an institution for higher education and its growing expertise in preparing its students for the professional society, the working environments and attitudes towards black, blue-collar workers had not changed. Workers were not given health insurance, received little pay, had inconsistent and demanding schedules, often working ten to twelve days without a day off, and were treated unprofessionally. One nurse’s maid, Helen Johnstone, recalled being treated like a servant: “When I was a nurse’s maid, <b>our</b> <b>second</b> head nurse, Joan Ashley, she used to run me everywhere—uptown to get the immunizations and {{to put them in}} my refrigerator. She had me run to the library to return her books for her on time.” It was not unusual for black workers to be treated this way, especially as a result of unclear job descriptions that gave those with higher power control over the tasks assigned to black workers.|$|E

In demand as an acting teacher during this period, he resumed acting after an absence of nearly twenty years. Davis earned a number of roles on stage and film before accepting the position of artistic director of the Vancouver Playhouse Acting School, which required relocating with his wife and family. Davis writes in his memoir, [...] "And so, in the fall of 1985, we hitched <b>our</b> <b>second</b> hand boat to <b>our</b> <b>second</b> hand car and drove across the country".|$|E

500|$|Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after seeing two news reports about Project Dante, a robotic explorer created by NASA that had been sent into a volcano. Chris Carter said of the episode, [...] "I think that's {{the first time in}} <b>our</b> <b>second</b> season that we were telling what's one of our serial stories rather than our mythological stories. In other words, it was an X-File rather than one of the cosmology shows that explore the characters". However, Gordon felt that the episode allowed him to explore the possible results of Mulder's search for the truth, echoing this in the mindset of Daniel Trepkos and the interactions between the two characters. Gordon noted that [...] "the natural endpoint of this quest for the truth is madness", comparing Mulder's treatment of Trepkos with the events of the novel Heart of Darkness.|$|E

Kirkman insisted that the similarities especially with 28 Days Later was coincidental. [...] "I saw 28 Days Later shortly before the first issue of Walking Dead was released," [...] he stated. [...] "That first issue came out in October of 2003 and 28 Days Later was released in the States in June of 2003. So we were working on <b>our</b> <b>second</b> issue by the time I saw it.

[...] Besides the heavier songs, the album features two acoustic ballads in [...] "Daughter" [...] and [...] "Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town". A few of the songs incorporate elements of funk, including [...] "Animal", [...] "Blood", and [...] "Rats". McCready stated that it wasn't that the band [...] "sat down and decided to be funky," [...] but rather {{it came from the}} band [...] "exploring different directions and combining our influences."
