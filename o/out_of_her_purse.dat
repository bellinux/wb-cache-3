500|$|During the Verizon Ladies First Tour {{which also}} {{featured}} Alicia Keys, Missy Elliott and Tamia, Beyoncé performed [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] in New York City {{to an audience}} of over 20,000. Before singing, she told the audience {{that she was going to}} sing about [...] "a relationship horror story". She pulled a pair of red panties <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> saying that these were not hers but belonged to her cheating boyfriend's mistress. During the performance, Beyoncé held out the microphone for the audience's response, which was [...] "is all I got in the end". She shouted that she wanted to hear everybody from front to back, and continued singing, then told the audience that she wrote the song for [...] "each and every one of y'all!".|$|E
60|$|The little tremulous {{old lady}} was so pleased with this reply {{that she took}} half-a-crown <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> {{and put it into}} the boy's hand. He looked at her in silent surprise.|$|E
6000|$|Little Clive was the {{innocent}} and lucky object upon whom the increasing affection of the Newcomes for their Indian brother was exhibited. When {{he was first}} brought home a sickly child, consigned to his maternal aunt, the kind old maiden lady at Brighton, Hobson Brothers scarce took any notice of the little man, but left him to the entire superintendence of his own family. Then there came a large remittance from his father, and the child was asked by Uncle Newcome at Christmas. Then his father's name was mentioned in general orders, and Uncle Hobson asked little Clive at Midsummer. Then Lord H., a late Governor-General, coming home, and meeting the brothers at a grand dinner at the Albion, given by the Court of Directors to his late Excellency, spoke to the bankers about that most distinguished officer their relative; and Mrs. Hobson drove over to see his aunt, where the boy was; gave him a sovereign <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> and advised strongly {{that he should be}} sent to Timpany's along wit her own boy. Then Clive went from one uncle's house to another; and was liked at both; and much preferred ponies to ride, going out after rabbits with the keeper, money in his pocket (charge to the debit of Lieut.-Col. T. Newcome), and clothes from the London tailor, to the homely quarters and conversation of poor kind old Aunt Honeyman at Brighton. Clive's uncles were not unkind; they liked each other; their wives, who hated each other, united in liking Clive when they knew him, and petting the wayward handsome boy: they were only pursuing the way of the world, which huzzas all prosperity, and turns away from misfortune as from some contagious disease. Indeed, how can we see a man's brilliant qualities if he is what we call in the shade? ...|$|E
5000|$|Her {{biography}} celebrates her for [...] "the pious intention under vow to free captives. She {{arranged the}} ransom price and weighed out the silver. ... When the captives had been bought {{back with the}} ransom money <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>purse,</b> at <b>her</b> command they returned to their families and homes." ...|$|R

Lois remarks {{that it is too}} bad he was not there as well, whereupon Clark pulls the second press pass sticking <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> open <b>purse</b> and says, [...] "I would've been, if I hadn't lost my pass." ...|$|R
60|$|No sixty pounds, however, came to {{help the}} {{household}} {{at the end of}} the half year, and it fell deeper and deeper into trouble--Mrs. Sedley, who was growing infirm and was much shaken, remained silent or wept a great deal with Mrs. Clapp in the kitchen. The butcher was particularly surly, the grocer insolent: once or twice little Georgy had grumbled about the dinners, and Amelia, who still would have been satisfied with a slice <b>of</b> bread for <b>her</b> own dinner, could not but perceive that her son was neglected and purchased little things <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> private <b>purse</b> to keep the boy in health.|$|R
60|$|GREAT-HEART. This {{woman is}} a witch, and it is by virtue of her sorceries that this ground is enchanted. Whoever doth lay their head down in her lap, had as good lay it down upon that block over which the axe doth hang; and whoever lay their eyes upon her beauty, are counted the enemies of God (James 4:4; 1 John 2:15). This is she that maintaineth in their splendour all those that are the enemies of pilgrims. Yea, this is she that hath bought off many a man from a pilgrim's life. She is a great gossipper; she is always, both she and her daughters, at one pilgrim's heels or another, now commending, and then preferring the excellencies of this life. She is a bold and impudent slut; she will talk with any man. She always laugheth poor pilgrims to scorn; but highly commends the rich. If there be one cunning to get money in a place, she will speak well of him from house to house; she loveth banqueting and feasting mainly well; she is always at one full table or another. She has given it out in some places, {{that she is a}} goddess, and {{therefore}} some do worship her. She has her times and open places of cheating; and she will say and avow it, that none can show a good comparable to hers. She promiseth to dwell with children's children, if they will but love and make much of her. She will cast <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> gold like dust, in some places, and to some persons. She loves to be sought after, spoken well of, and to lie in the bosoms of men. She is never weary of commending her commodities, and she loves them most that think best of her. She will promise to some crowns and kingdoms, if they will but take her advice; yet many hath she brought to the halter, and ten thousand times more to hell.|$|E

50|$|A Kit-Kat ad {{campaign}} {{from the late}} 80s involved {{a man and a}} woman in two separate commercials deciding they wanted something to eat. The woman pulls food items <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> while the man pulls them out of his pants pocket, and the items they pull out before pulling out a Kit-Kat bar were items that, in real life, couldn't easily be stored there (i.e. the woman pulls a fully intact birthday cake <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> while the man pulls a large hamburger out of his pocket).|$|E
6000|$|Clara's voice {{took the}} plaintive tone that her aunt {{never knew how}} to resist, and with a sigh the old lady drew forth her ivory tablets and {{prepared}} to record the amount that Clara had just spent at the confectioner's shop. Her expenditure was always made <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> aunt's <b>purse,</b> but the poor girl knew, by bitter experience, {{that sooner or later}} [...] "Mad Mathesis" [...] would expect an exact account of every penny that had gone, and she waited, with ill-concealed impatience, while the old lady turned the tablets over and over, till she had found the one headed [...] "PETTY CASH." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nothing had happened--they {{were both}} as safe {{and as well}} as when I had left them. Laura sent her love, and begged that I would let <b>her</b> know <b>of</b> my return a day beforehand. Her sister added, in {{explanation}} of this message, that she had saved [...] "nearly a sovereign" [...] <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own private <b>purse,</b> {{and that she had}} claimed the privilege of ordering the dinner and giving the dinner which was to celebrate the day of my return. I read these little domestic confidences in the bright morning with the terrible recollection of what had happened the evening before vivid in my memory. The necessity of sparing Laura any sudden knowledge of the truth was the first consideration which the letter suggested to me. I wrote at once to Marian to tell her what I have told in these pages--presenting the tidings as gradually and gently as I could, and warning her not to let any such thing as a newspaper fall in Laura's way while I was absent. In the case of any other woman, less courageous and less reliable, I might have hesitated before I ventured on unreservedly disclosing the whole truth. But I owed it to Marian to be faithful to my past experience <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> and to trust her as I trusted herself.|$|R
