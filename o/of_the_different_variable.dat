40|$|A {{method to}} numerically solve the Euler {{equations}} for fluids with general equations of state is presented. It {{is based on}} a formulation solving the conservation equations for either pressure primitive variables or entropy variables, instead of the commonly used conservation variables. We use a space-time discontinuous Galerkin finite-element discretization, which yields a highly local, potentially higher-order scheme. The algorithm is applied to test cases for compressible fluids to demonstrate its capabilities and the performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>variable</b> sets...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a common methodological {{flaw in the}} comparison of variable selection methods. A practical approach to guide the search or the selection process is to compute cross-validation performance estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>variable</b> subsets. Used with computationally intensive search algorithms, these estimates may overfit and yield biased predictions. Therefore, they cannot be used reliably to compare two selection methods, as is shown by the empirical results of this paper. Instead, like in other instances of the model selection problem, independent test sets {{should be used for}} determining the final performance. The claims made in the literature about the superiority of more exhaustive search algorithms over simpler ones are also revisited, and some of them infirmed.

40|$|We analyse the {{spectral}} variability of MCG– 06 - 30 - 15 with 600 [*]k[*]s of XMM–Newton data, including 300 [*]k[*]s of new {{data from the}} joint XMM–Newton and NuSTAR 2013 observational campaign. We use principal component analysis to find high-resolution, model-independent spectra <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>variable</b> components of the spectrum. We find that over 99 [*]per[*]cent of the variability can be described by just three components, which are consistent with variations in the normalization of the power-law continuum (∼ 97 [*]per[*]cent), the photon index (∼ 2 [*]per[*]cent) and the normalization of a relativistically blurred reflection spectrum (∼ 0. 5 [*]per[*]cent). We also find a fourth significant component but this is heavily diluted by noise, and we can attribute all the remaining spectral variability to noise. All three components {{are found to be}} variable on time-scales from 20 down to 1 [*]k[*]s, which corresponds to a distance from the central black hole of less than 70 gravitational radii. We compare these results with those derived from spectral fitting, and find them to be in very good agreement with our interpretation of the principal components. We conclude that the observed relatively weak variability in the reflected component of the spectrum of MCG– 06 - 30 - 15 is due to the effects of light-bending close to the event horizon of the black hole, and demonstrate that principal component analysis is an effective tool for analysing spectral variability in this regime...|$|E

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) {{has the ability}} to adapt to the host environment by escaping from host immune responses. We previously observed that escape from humoral immunity, both at the individual and at a population level, coincided with longer variable loops and an increased number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) in the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) and, in particular, in variable regions 1 and 2 (V 1 V 2). Here, we provide several lines of evidence for the role of V 1 V 2 in the resistance of HIV- 1 to neutralizing antibodies. First, we determined that the increasing neutralization resistance of a reference panel of tier-categorized neutralization-sensitive and -resistant HIV- 1 variants coincided with a longer V 1 V 2 loop containing more PNGS. Second, an exchange <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>variable</b> regions of Env from a neutralization-sensitive HIV- 1 variant into a neutralization-resistant escape variant from the same individual revealed that the V 1 V 2 loop is a strong determinant for sensitivity to autologous-serum neutralization. Third, exchange of the V 1 V 2 loop of neutralization-sensitive HIV- 1 variants from historical seroconverters with the V 1 V 2 loop of neutralization-resistant HIV- 1 variants from contemporary seroconverters decreased the neutralization sensitivity to CD 4 -binding site-directed antibodies. Overall, we demonstrate that an increase in the length of the V 1 V 2 loop and/or the number of PNGS in that same region of the HIV- 1 envelope glycoprotein is directly involved in the protection of HIV- 1 against HIV-specific neutralizing antibodies, possibly by shielding underlying epitopes in the envelope glycoprotein from antibody recognitio...|$|E
40|$|We analyse {{a sample}} of 26 active galactic nuclei (AGN) with deep XMM-Newton observations, using {{principal}} component analysis (PCA) to find model-independent spectra <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>variable</b> components. In total, we identify at least 12 qualitatively different patterns of spectral variability, involving several different mechanisms, including five sources which show evidence of variable relativistic reflection (MCG- 6 - 30 - 15, NGC 4051, 1 H 0707 - 495, NGC 3516 and Mrk 766) and three which show evidence of varying partial covering neutral absorption (NGC 4395, NGC 1365 and NGC 4151). In {{over half of the}} sources studied, the variability is dominated by changes in a power-law continuum, both in terms of changes in flux and power-law index, which could be produced by propagating fluctuations within the corona. Simulations are used to find unique predictions for different physical models, and we then attempt to qualitatively match the results from the simulations to the behaviour observed in the real data. We are able to explain {{a large proportion of the}} variability in these sources using simple models of spectral variability, but more complex models may be needed for the remainder. We have begun the process of building up a library of different principal components, so that spectral variability in AGN can quickly be matched to physical processes. We show that PCA can be an extremely powerful tool for distinguishing different patterns of variability in AGN, and that it can be used effectively on the large amounts of high-quality archival data available from the current generation of X-ray telescopes. We will make our PCA code available upon request to the lead author...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{variation}} of V- 1 antigens of Mycoplasma pulmonis has been correlated with variable {{expression of the}} cytadherence properties of this organism and has been implicated as a virulence determining factor in M. pulmonis-induced murine respiratory disease, the precise function of these antigens remains unknown. We have cloned and characterized genes encoding V- 1 from two M. pulmonis UAB CT V- 1 variants that differ in hemadsorption properties. A comparison of the nucleotide sequences revealed that these two variant genes were identical in the 5 '-most 724 nucleotides. Regions of extensive divergence that contained repeated sequences were found 3 ' to this conserved region. On {{the basis of their}} deduced amino acid sequences, one variant expressed a V- 1 protein of 94. 2 kDa presumptively containing 40 repeats of 17 amino acids and the other expressed a protein of 27. 4 kDa consisting 2 direct, noncontiguous 9 -amino-acid repeats. These general properties, as well as the presence of a prokaryotic lipoprotein acylation sequence (L-X-Y-C), indicated that the genes encoding V- 1 were similar in structure to genes encoding other mycoplasma surface lipoproteins. Further analysis of sequences flanking these genes revealed that these variants arose via an inversion event which provided an interchange of the two variable regions {{as well as for the}} conserved region of these genes and immunoblot analyses using rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for synthetic peptides derived from the sequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>variable</b> regions indicated that DNA inversion acted as a switch which allowed only one of the two different genes to be expressed at any given time. This inversion model clearly provides a mechanism by which M. pulmonis can alter its surface architecture and also strongly suggests that the as-yet-undefined function of V- 1 residues in the variable carboxy region of these proteins...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{synthesize}} the findings of prior bankruptcy prediction research studies by compiling and classifying the independent variables used as predictor variables in the studies. The objective is to find out the popularity of the different types of the predictor variables by classifying the variables into the categories describing the fincancial function of the variables, and by assessing the popularity of the significant variables in the categories. This work studies elementary theories on firm failure and bankruptcy to discuss and seek justitication for what might be the reasons for using the most popular financial function measures in the bankruptcy prediction. Bankruptcy prediction research literature covers vast amount of studies in which various different predicton models are developed for predicting bankruptcy. Usually these studies use a prediction model with a set of some financial and/or non-financial variables that are presumed to be relevant proxies for financial distress and eventually business failure and bankrupcty. However, there seems to be no consensus or unified theory on how the variables predicting bankrupcty should be selected, thus the numerous bankruptcy prediction research studies include vast number and various different types of variables that are presumed to be applicable in predicting bankruptcy. This study includes a systematic literature review where 51 bankruptcy prediction research studies were collected from well-recognized scientific journals. The studies included into the review were such that included a single or multiple bankruptcy prediction models, the detailed description of the independent variables, and the information about the statistical significances of the independent variables. The variables were then classified according to their financial function and a meta-analysis were conducted on those variables which were significant in bankruptcy prediction, to find out the popularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>variable</b> categories. The findings of this study suggest that the most popular predictor variables included into the banktuptcy predicton models are accounting-based financial ratios, particurarly ones measuring liquidity, profitability, and financial leverage, and that there exists also theoretical foundation for using these variables in the bankruptcy prediction...|$|E
