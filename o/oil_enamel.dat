He creates over-paintings, collages and cut-outs: using pencils, coloured pencils and felt-tip pens, <b>oil,</b> <b>enamel,</b> and acrylic, on such supports as cardboard, paper, canvas, recycled materials and hand-made tapestries. He also makes films and sculptures, and text too {{plays a major role in}} his works. His subject matter encompasses superheroes, dinosaurs, devils, spaceships and historical villains.|$|E
50|$|Culwell’s {{interest}} in texture {{led him to}} experiment radically with material properties—often he combined oil paint, commercial <b>oil</b> <b>enamel,</b> and Duco on a single canvas. Duco and oil paint are not wholly compatible, which frequently led to the curdling and wrinkling of the paint surface—an effect that pleased Culwell, who took this property to extremes in the 1950-54 Roof series. Completed while Culwell lived in San Antonio, Texas, the Roof series consists of paintings that Culwell set to dry {{on the roof of}} his home. He found, during his experiments with Duco, that the paint emits noxious fumes while drying, which led him to place the paintings on the roof. This exposed the work to the sun and other elements, which allowed the dense accretion characteristic of earlier works but did not take the amount of intense labor and time.|$|E

He is considered by many to be the first major sports artist in the world, challenged only in his later years by a new generation of artists like Stephen Holland and Richard T. Slone. His work is in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian, the Whitney Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the State Hermitage Museum in Russia, Wadham College at Oxford and in museums and art galleries the world over, as well as in private and corporate collections.|$|E
5000|$|De Kooning’s {{well-known}} Woman series, {{begun in}} 1950 (after meeting his future wife) and culminating in Woman VI, owes much to Picasso, not {{least in the}} aggressive, penetrative breaking apart of the figure, and the spaces around it. Picasso’s late works show signs that he, in turn, saw images of works by Pollock and de Kooning.De Kooning led the 1950s art world into a new movement known as American abstract expressionism. “From 1940 to the present, Woman has manifested herself in de Kooning’s paintings and drawings as at once the focus of desire, frustration, inner conflict, pleasure, … and as posing problems of conception and handling as demanding as those of an engineer.” [...] The female figure is an important symbol for de Kooning’s art career and his own life. The Woman painting is considered as a significant work of art for the museum through its historical context about the post-World War II history and American feminist movement. Additionally, the medium (<b>oil,</b> <b>enamel,</b> and charcoal on canvas) of this painting makes it different from others of de Kooning’s time.|$|E
30|$|The {{presence}} of drying oil was indicated in particular by {{high levels of}} dicarboxylic acids. These are relatively stable end-products formed upon oxidation and scission of unsaturated fatty acids and are encountered in relatively high amounts in aged oil paint systems. It is thought that {{the ratio of the}} diacids suberic acid (Su, C 8) to azelaic acid (Az, C 9) gives an indication whether the oil has been prepolymerized by heat treatment [34, 50], since isomerization of the original double bond systems during heating leads to the formation of elevated amounts of diacids other than azelaic acid. Su/Az ratios of 0.4 – 0.5 have been proposed as an indication of heat-processing of the drying oils, although the value will vary according to the exact nature and extent of prepolymerization and other factors. Bodied oils such as stand oil have higher viscosity and were used in <b>oil</b> <b>enamel</b> paints to improve application and performance characteristics [9, 36]. In the dried paint samples from cans examined, the generally high Su/Az ratios of 0.36 – 0.59 suggest that the oil medium has undergone heat-bodying. In comparison to the dried paint samples, the liquid samples analysed did not exhibit detectable levels of diacids and correspondingly higher levels of monounsaturated (oleic) and polyunsaturated acids (linoleic, linolenic and isomers) were found; this is consistent with bulk paint that has been aged in a closed container and not exposed to oxidation.|$|E

5000|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} to the mid-1990s, Stella created {{a large body}} of work that responded in a general way to Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick. During this time, the {{increasingly}} deep relief of Stella’s paintings gave way to full three-dimensionality, with sculptural forms derived from cones, pillars, French curves, waves, and decorative architectural elements. To create these works, the artist used collages or maquettes that were then enlarged and re-created with the aids of assistants, industrial metal cutters, and digital technologies. [...] La scienza della pigrizia (The Science of Laziness), from 1984, is an example of Stella's transition from two-dimensionality to three-dimensionality. It is fabricated from <b>oil</b> paint, <b>enamel</b> paint, and alkyd paint on canvas, etched magnesium, aluminum and fiberglass.|$|R

5000|$|Best {{known for}} {{introducing}} new themes and subject-matter into Australian art and {{being one of}} the first Australian artists to be influenced by Pop art, particularly British Pop artists like Peter Blake, Allen Jones, Derek Boshier, Joe Tilson and the formal strategies of the post-modernist R. B. Kitaj. Another major Influence was and remains the British painter Francis Bacon. He was an associate of Brett Whiteley and there was a likely mutual influence. Sansom has had a distinct influence on subsequent Australian art, paving the way for later notable artists such as Juan Davila and Howard Arkley. His work is represented by the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and the Mertz Collection. His paintings are eclectic, studded with allusions both historical, cultural and personal. There is something almost diaristic about his work, but its presentation is anything but linear and logical. Abiding themes are mortality, ageing, sexual identity, popular and youth culture and cinema. There is also a strong element of humour, iconoclasm and irony in his work, from their titles, such as [...] "Art Can't Fart (for Rose Selavay)", [...] "Four Wise Men Looking for God in Abstract Art", [...] "Dr Fu Manchu's Death by Gyro" [...] or [...] "Ship of Fools (Hello sailor!)" [...] to comic and grotesque figurative elements and their sometimes lurid but highly resolved colour schemes. On a technical level his paintings combine <b>oils,</b> <b>enamels</b> (both sprayed and applied with brush) and collaged elements from personal photographs to objects stuck on or painted over. Stylistically Sansom uses a wide array of painting techniques but signature devices include allowing earlier layers of paint to remain visible, hard-edge geometric shapes juxtaposed with playful, lyrical, more organic or atmospheric passages of paint and figurative [...] "doodles", often at the margins of the paintings.|$|R
60|$|He was jarred as by {{nothing else}} when the paragon of stenographers, Miss McGoun, {{suddenly}} left him, though her reasons were excellent--she needed a rest, {{her sister was}} sick, she might not do any more work for six months. He was uncomfortable with her successor, Miss Havstad. What Miss Havstad's given name was, {{no one in the}} office ever knew. It seemed improbable that she had a given name, a lover, a powder-puff, or a digestion. She was so impersonal, this slight, pale, industrious Swede, that it was vulgar to think of her as going to an ordinary home to eat hash. She was a perfectly <b>oiled</b> and <b>enameled</b> machine, and she ought, each evening, to have been dusted off and shut in her desk beside her too-slim, too-frail pencil points. She took dictation swiftly, her typing was perfect, but Babbitt became jumpy when he tried to work with her. She made him feel puffy, and at his best-beloved daily jokes she looked gently inquiring. He longed for Miss McGoun's return, and thought of writing to her.|$|R
5|$|The {{economic}} {{revolution in}} England and the tariff {{policies of the}} British also caused massive de-industrialization in other sectors throughout India and Mysore. For example, the gunny bag weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, which they lost when the British began ruling the area. The import of a chemical substitute for saltpetre (potassium nitrate) affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder. The import of kerosene affected the Ganiga community which supplied <b>oils.</b> Foreign <b>enamel</b> and crockery industries affected the native pottery business, and mill-made blankets replaced the country-made blankets called kambli. This economic fallout {{led to the formation}} of community-based social welfare organisations to help those within the community to cope better with their new economic situation, including youth hostels for students seeking education and shelter. However, the British economic policies created a class structure consisting of a newly established middle class comprising various blue and white-collared occupational groups, including agents, brokers, lawyers, teachers, civil servants and physicians. Due to a more flexible caste hierarchy, the middle class contained a heterogeneous mix of people from different castes.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the masks}} are shaped, they are painted and {{otherwise}} decorated. Facial features may be cut into or {{painted on the}} mask. Most masks are painted first {{with a layer of}} white with colors added. Traditionally the decorative paint was <b>oil</b> and <b>enamel,</b> but many have switched to acrylics and other commercial paints. [...] Although details such as beards, mustaches and eyebrows can be painted or sculpted on the mask, more realistic versions add ixtle, cotton, animal hair (such as horse or sheep) and even human hair, as well as other materials. Eyes can be imitated on the mask with the use of marbles, mica, flat or curve glass (painted behind) or glass eyes. Many tiger masks place mirrors for eyes. Teeth can be added with the use of real ones from animals or humans, as well as metal, cactus spines, corn or reeds. If the mask has a tongue, it is often of leather or tin. Horns on devil masks are commonly made from those from cows, goats or deer. Finished masks often receive further decoration with ribbons, gold accents, bells, sequins and more. Often this addition of decoration is done by the dancers themselves to personalize them, especially the addition of beards and fangs. In the town of Teloloapan, Guerrero, the local government holds a contest for the best decoration of devil masks.|$|R
5000|$|He uses so many {{different}} media but his goal {{seems to be the}} unending search to express his deepest, almost agonising feelings: not really concerned if he uses collage, watercolour, <b>enamel,</b> <b>oil,</b> canvas, board, card or other media. He could be closely compared to contemporary artists such as André Lanskoy and Kurt Schwitters among others of that period. He does not digress form his main themes of artistic work and his paintings are easily recognisable as Lanzi. His seclusion in Chiddingfold allowed him to follow his own artistic path, often working late into the night in his fairly dimly lit studio. Paintings and compositions by Lanzi are in private collections in England, France, South America, United States, Belgium, Spain, Canada and other countries. His work reflects the isolation, intensity and creativity of an abstract artist who Michael Budd described as [...] "the self-absorbed".|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to verify the {{presence}} of the carcinogenic risk for teachers, technical assistants and students in 96 secondary schools, providing suggestions for its assessment. Since the analysis of the national and international scientific literature does not reveal data on the evaluation of the carcinogenic risk nor in schools nor in similar environments, the authors gave importance to the preliminary phase of the risk assessment that is to say the inspections aimed to detect the possible presence of risk agents and to identify the possible exposed subjects. The evaluation of the exposition through the execution of environmental and biological monitoring has to be performed, according to the authors opinion, only after this indispensable preliminary phase. The carcinogenic risk has been ascertained in relation to the presence of substances used for didactical means (fuels, mineral <b>oils,</b> reagents, <b>enamels</b> and pitch, ceramic mixtures and metallic alloys) or produced during practical activities (hard wood dusts, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) deriving from high temperatures cooking), analyzing the tasks implying their use and identifying the exposed subjects.

5000|$|The 19th century {{brought about}} the {{so-called}} [...] "backward classes movement", {{a direct result of}} the hegemony in employment (in educational and government sectors) by the wealthy few and the loss of jobs across southern India due to the Industrial Revolution in England. This movement was heralded first by the Lingayats followed by the Vokkaligas and the Kurubas. The economic revolution in England and the tariff policies of the British caused massive deindustrialization in India, especially in the textile sector. For example, Bangalore was known to have had a flourishing textile industry prior to 1800 and the gunny bag weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, a state of events that changed significantly when the British began ruling the area. The import of a chemical substitute of saltpetre (potassium nitrate) affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder. The import of kerosene affected the Ganiga community who supplied <b>oils.</b> Foreign <b>enamel</b> and crockery industries affected the native pottery business and the mill made blankets replaced the country made kambli. This economic fallout led to the formation of community based social welfare organizations such as the Lingayat Vidyavardhakara Sangha in Dharwad in 1883, the Vokkaligara Sanga in Bangalore in 1906 and the Praja Mitra Mandali in Mysore in 1917. The goal of these organizations was to help those within the community to cope better with a new economic situation. Community based youth hostels sprang up to help students seeking education and shelter.|$|R

50|$|Stingel became first {{recognised}} in {{the late}} 1980s for his monochromatic works, silvery paintings with undertones of red, yellow or blue from 1987 to 1994. Stingel’s later abstract paintings from the 1990s consist of oils in pure, brilliant colors exuberantly splayed, dripped, pressed, and pulled across a black field. The works begin with {{the application of a}} thick layer of paint in a particular colour to the canvas. Pieces of gauze are then placed over the surface of the canvas and silver paint is added using a spray gun. Finally, the gauze is removed, resulting in a richly textured surface. For his works on paper Stingel is known for a technique of applying <b>oil</b> paint and/or <b>enamel</b> onto canvas or paper through a tulle screen. At the Venice Biennale in 1989, he published an illustrated “do-it-yourself” manual in English, Italian, German, French, Spanish and Japanese, 'Instructions, Istruzioni, Anleitung...', outlining the equipment and procedure that would enable anyone to create one of his paintings. In so doing, he suggests that everyone could produce a work of abstraction by following a simple set of instructions.|$|R
50|$|The {{most notable}} driers are litharge, sugar of lead, patent driers, sulfate of zinc and {{manganese}} dioxide. Liquid driers, such as terebene, {{are also in}} use. Litharge, an oxide of lead, is in most general use. Sugar of lead is used, ground in oil, for light tints. Sulfate of zinc and manganese driers are used for paints in which zinc white is the base, which would be injured by lead driers. Pigments are preparations of metallic, earthy or animal origin mixed into paint to give it color. For oil paint they are usually ground in oil; for distemper they are sold as a finely ground powder. The ordinary pigments are white lead, zinc white, umbers, siennas, ochres, chromes, Venetian red, Indian red, lampblack, bone black, vegetable black, ultramarine, Prussian blue, vermilion, red lead, oxide of iron, lakes and Vandyke brown. The term enamel paint was first given to a compound of zinc white, petrol and resin, which possessed on drying a hard glossy surface. The name is now applied to any colored paint of this nature. Quick-drying enamels are spirit varnishes ground with the desired pigment. For slow-drying <b>enamels</b> <b>oil</b> varnishes form the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|Paul Rusconi {{was born}} in California. He studied at Pepperdine University, {{and is now a}} {{contemporary}} artist living and working in Los Angeles. [...] Born and raised in California, Los Angeles based artist Paul Rusconi investigates the portrait with his own photo-based images as well as found or sourced images from popular culture. His work is a digital screening process often combined with nail polish, <b>oil</b> paint, engine <b>enamel</b> and monochromatic photography. The work is layered and framed. The shadow image on the monochromatic photographic is a simple projection through the Plexiglas. There is no image on the actual photograph until one is projected on it by the digital screen. His own photography is used for images that create a grey scale from blue, magenta, yellow and black. Up close all that is evident are colorful dots - and from about 12 feet away - those dots turn into a grey scale or what looks to be a black-and-white image. This notion came from the observation that a grey-scale could be created from color and therefore such a grey-scale could be broken down into color. The subjects have included artists, musicians, politicians and currently with his fascination of pop-culture and its huge and wide-reaching skate sub-culture Rusconi focuses his current group of portraits on today's 14 most influential skateboarders in the world.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the success}} of her Sky Felt hangings, Cowern began to expand and develop the media, taking {{inspiration}} from the natural elements found in her immediate surroundings. At heart she was an abstract painter, as she explained. [...] "I have often found the need to balance my observational work with completely abstract work, developing it along side." [...] Taking encouragement from her own garden she produced Hydrangea, (1986) a felt later purchased by the Shipley Art Gallery. She {{would return to the}} subject years later, where, using first oils and then pastels she produced equally stunning but differing representations. Indeed, this flirtation with varying media became one of her many strengths; after choosing her subject she hopscotched between a variety of media, producing watercolours, <b>oils,</b> pastels, pencil, <b>enamel,</b> tempera’s etc. She interpreted the geological structure of a group of tide-washed pebbles; and captured the spectrum of light as it danced through her windows. In 1996 she received an award from the Northern Arts Board and Cumbria County Council, which allowed her to produce a body of work inspired by the Solway Coast on the Cumbrian side. Not satisfied with encapsulating the changing facets of the beach and the tide at Allonby, she moved down the coast to sketch, paint and felt the sandstone rocks below the Roman Fort at Maryport. Then on to Workington to study the slag formed cliffs, with their giant boulders and rusting metal. The coast would demand her attention for a number of years, as she explored every aspect, endeavouring to improve and perfect what she had previously done. After completing a commission to decorate a Summer House on the shore of Windermere, Cowern continued with the theme and produced a body of work centred on her own conservatory, where she contrasted the wooden-glazed structure, the hanging vines, and spectacular floral displays with decaying compost. For the remainder of her life she would continue with recurring themes, at Bassenthwaite, Isel, the River Derwent, Bergen; and many more places and many more themes.|$|R
