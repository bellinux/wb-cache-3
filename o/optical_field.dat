2500|$|The {{absorption}} and emission {{cross sections}} of the ions can be modeled as ellipsoids with the major axes aligned at random in all directions in different glass sites.

Also, those excited ions aligned with the signal field produce more stimulated emission. The change in gain is thus dependent on the alignment of the polarizations of the pump and signal lasers – i.e. whether the two lasers are interacting with the same sub-set of dopant ions or not.|$|E

40|$|Classical {{definition}} of {{degree of polarization}} is expressed in quantum domain by replacing intensities through quantum mechanical average values of relevant number operators and is viewed as first generalization of Intensity. This definition assigns inaccurately the unpolarized status to some typical <b>optical</b> <b>fields</b> such as amplitude coherent phase randomized and hidden polarized, which are not truly unpolarized light. The apparent paradoxical trait is circumvented by proposing a new {{definition of}} degree of polarization in Quantum Optics through second generalization of Intensity. The correspondence of new degree of polarization to usual degree of polarization in Quantum Optics is established. It is seen that the two definitions disagree significantly for intense <b>optical</b> <b>fields</b> but coincides for weak light (thermal light) or for <b>optical</b> <b>fields</b> in which occupancy of photons in orthogonal mode is very feeble. Our proposed definition of degree of polarization, similar to other proposals in literature, reveals an interesting feature that states of polarization of <b>optical</b> quantum <b>fields</b> depend upon the average photons (intensity) present therein.

Chapter 2 proposes a novel optical geometry for the full-field coherence visualization to study the coherence diffraction. The non-diffracting solutions for the coherence function and the coherence interference phenomena have been presented in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, respectively. As the application, Chapter 5 presents the experimental demonstration of the coherence holography to synthesize the arbitrary spatial coherence function. To take the vector nature, Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 develop our optical geometry for the full-field visualization of coherence polarization matrix to study of the stochastic electromagnetic fields on propagation. The principle of coherence tensor holography is proposed in Chapter 8 and experimentally demonstrated for the first time. At last, conclusions and future works have been given...|$|R
