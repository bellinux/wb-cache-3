25|$|Another {{alternative}} is to equip the vehicle with a single wiper placed in the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield,</b> allowing it to cover both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield.</b> This mitigates the amount of drag by decreasing the frontal area of the blade. While such application may be useful for racing, for most road vehicles this would produce minimal improvement in overall drag reduction.|$|E
25|$|To {{minimize}} {{production costs}} for export, {{the windshield wipers}} used a pattern where the wipers started {{in the center and}} wiped towards the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield,</b> instead of from the passenger side towards the driver.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> cockpit <b>windshield</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first 247s was angled forward, instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{conventional}} aft sweep. This was {{the design}} solution (similar to that adopted by other contemporary aircraft that used a forward-raked windscreen) to <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> lighted control panel instruments reflecting off <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> at night, {{but it turned}} out that <b>the</b> forward-sloping <b>windshield</b> would reflect ground lights instead, especially during landings and it also increased drag slightly. By <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 247D, <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> was sloped aft in the usual way, and the night-glare problem was resolved by installing an extension (the glarescreen) over the control panel.|$|R

25|$|In 1971, the Cityliner was {{introduced}} to the public. This design had a passenger platform above the driver's cab, and included an onboard toilet. The vehicle also made use, of glass-fibre reinforced plastic for certain areas of the body, this was the first instance when this technique was used. In 1973, the Jetliner {{was introduced}}, featuring a large one-piece windshield, with the driver and door windows sloping from the passenger window line down to the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> level.|$|E
25|$|For 1932, the Greater Eights {{received}} new, more streamlined styling, {{including a}} greater slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield.</b> Hudson's engineering stylist, Frank S. Spring, made the fenders more graceful {{and gave the}} car's body gentler curves. The 1932 models featured a prominent Vee'd grille with vertical chrome theme. The cars were recognizable by their uniquely styled rounded-triangle shaped headlights and parking lights, which mimicked the shape of Hudson's triangle logo. The triangle theme was also repeated in the interior, including the driver's floor pedals.|$|E
25|$|Each car is {{required}} to display its number on each door {{of the car and}} on its roof. The front of the car and bottom of the rear bumper are required to match the decal specifications of the car manufacturer. Each car {{is required}} to display a series of around 30 NASCAR sponsor decals just to the left of each door and on the front fenders. These contingency decals represent series sponsors and bonus money teams are eligible to earn during the race, but may be omitted in the event in which they conflict with the team's sponsors or moral beliefs.

25|$|Beginning in 2013, the livery layout for the NASCAR Cup Series was altered, {{coinciding with}} the change to the Generation 6 model car. In lieu of the series sponsor like in lower series, the {{windshield}} prominently features the last name of the driver (as well as first name or first initial {{in the case of}} siblings and family members, as is the case for both Busch brothers, or suffixes for drivers such as Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Martin Truex, Jr.) placed in the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> header. Logos of the manufacturer are placed on each corner of the upper windshield. Number and sponsor logos were barred from being placed on the headlights and taillights, as not to obstruct each car model's unique characteristics. A new location for a single sponsor logo, however, was added {{to the rear of the}} roof adjacent to the number. In 2014, a new layout was created for participants in the NASCAR Chase for the Championship, requiring the cars to feature yellow roof numbers, front splitters and front fascias. The background <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> header would also be colored yellow, with the driver's name displayed in black lettering. A new Chase for the Championship logo would replace the normal NASCAR Cup Series logo in the contingency group. A decal would also be placed next to the driver's name above the door to signify each win a driver earned that season. For 2015, the liveries of the Xfinity and Camping World Truck Series would feature the driver's last name on the upper rear window. Starting in 2017, the Monster Energy logo is now on the front windshield with the driver name moving to the rear windshield in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series.|$|E

500|$|About 1454Z (now 0954 CDT {{due to the}} flight's {{crossing}} {{into the}} Central Time zone), a U.S. Air Force F-16 test pilot from the 40th Flight Test Squadron at Eglin AFB in western Florida, {{who happened to be}} in the air nearby, was directed by controllers to intercept N47BA. When the fighter was about [...] from the Learjet, at an altitude of about , the test pilot made two radio calls to N47BA but did not receive a response. The F-16 pilot made a visual inspection of the Lear, finding no visible damage to the airplane. Both engines were running, and the plane's red rotating anti-collision beacon was on (standard operation for aircraft in flight). The fighter pilot could not see inside the passenger section of the airplane because the windows seemed to be dark. Further, he stated that the entire right cockpit windshield was opaque, as if condensation or ice covered the inside. He also indicated that the left cockpit windshield was opaque, although several sections of the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> seemed to be only thinly covered by condensation or ice; a small rectangular section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> was clear, with only a small section of the glare shield visible through this area. He did not see any flight control movement. At about 1512Z, the F-16 pilot concluded his inspection of N47BA and broke formation, proceeding to Scott AFB in southwestern Illinois.|$|E

[...] Body design focused on a trimmer, fuselage design. [...] At the bottom of the rear quarters, a [...] "skeg" [...] - a downward fin - jutted outboard to counterbalance the rearward point of the quarter panel. Round tail lights, one on each side, were set into the rear cove. [...] For 1961, GM retired the compound curve windshields that it introduced in 1954, and the much hated body dogleg necessitated by the shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield.</b> [...] Instead of adopting the cleaner straight angled [...] "A" [...] pillar, Harley Earl, who was nearing the end of his tenure at GM, pushed for a small curved switch back, used in 1961â€“62, at the outboard base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshield.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Concealed {{windshield}} wipers, which {{presented a}} cleaner appearance hidden below the rear {{edge of the}} hood, were standard on the GTO and other 1968 GM products after having been originally introduced on the 1967 Pontiac Grand Prix.

50|$|Based on the evidence, they {{hypothesized}} that the pilot descended the aircraft beneath the minimum safety altitude while attempting to seek their target, Wujiapu airport. The visibility was bad when the plane flew into the fog, and the crews could only use compass heading to navigate. After the plane flew via Dangjiazhuang Railway Station, the first officer gradually lost the directing railway in his sight due to poor visibility. That occasion spoiled the flight plan. The first officer could look for the airport lights only visually, failed to recognize the terrain. Runway lights were blocked by the mountains surrounding Jinan. But instead, the pilot in control considered that it was simply caused by thick fog and misjudged the situation. Thus, he continued descending until the plane flew {{too close to the}} mountain. There were no ground proximity warning systems on aircraft at that time, so when the terrain abruptly appeared in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshields,</b> {{it was too late for}} the pilot to divert the plane.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{prototype}} model for an automatic anti-glare system to reduce <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> accidents during night time driving. <b>The</b> architecture consists <b>of</b> an aperture assembly and sensors. The aperture assembly is a two dimensional array of aperture elements, and their transmittances can be independently controllable. According to the transmittance, each aperture element will act either as opaque or transparent. <b>The</b> intensity <b>of</b> light ray is modulated by <b>the</b> transmittance <b>of</b> aperture elements, which causes <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> {{intensity of light}} passing through it. The prototype is implemented using liquid crystal display (LCD) and photovoltaic sensors. This system provides an automated mechanism to control the illumination according to <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> incoming light. <b>The</b> fundamental idea is to measure the incoming light and using measured values to generate patterns on the LCD to reduce the illumination. The proposed prototype can be implemented in two ways: i) as spectacles with liquid crystal sheets placed in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glasses, {{which can be used}} while driving, ii) by placing large liquid crystal sheets in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windshields</b> <b>of</b> vehicles. This method provides a flexible low cost implementation to build simple, reliable device to reduce <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light on-the-fly...|$|R
