5000|$|The term [...] "estrous" [...] {{refers to}} the point of female sexual {{excitement}} in mammals which causes ovulation. At ovulation females are most receptive to mating. This period is commonly referred to as heat. estrous synchronisation is the process of targeting female mammals to come to heat within a short time frame (36 to 96 hours). This is achieved through the use of one or more hormones. GnRH and Prostaglandin F2 are two hormones used in the “Synch” protocols during <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation.</b> [...] The synchronization of the estrous cycle is often used in the Dairy and Beef industries (and elsewhere) in order to decrease the costs for Artificial Insemination or feeding a bull by reducing the period in which it takes for all cows to be in heat and fall pregnant.|$|E
40|$|This {{review is}} aimed at {{providing}} information on current status of oestrus synchronization as a management tool in goats in Nigeria. <b>Oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> is a reproductive tool that enables goat farmers breed their animals within a short pre-determined period. The principle of <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> is chiefly {{the control of the}} luteal phase of the oestrous cycle and two basic mechanisms are employed. These include the use of prostaglandins or its analogues to shorten luteal life/induce premature luteolysis or the use of exogenous progesterone to prolong luteal life, thereby simulating the activity of natural progesterone produced by the corpus luteum. The latter is advantageous where the reproductive status of the flock is unknown. However, the former is easy to apply and only effective in cycling animals. Pharmaceutical products that have been employed in ES protocols in Nigeria include Lutalyse®, Estrumate®, EstroPLAN®, Fluorogestone acetate®, Sil-Oestrus®, Medroxyl-progesterone acetate®, Synchromate-B®, PMSG®, and more recently, the Controlled Internal Drug Release® (CIDR) devices. Over the last three decades, many attempts have been made at assessing the response of goats to various <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> agents and protocols in Nigeria. However, the low availability of these pharmaceutical agents and cost preclude the widespread use of <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> technique in goat production. The inclusion of gonadotrophins in <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> protocols have been reported to improve oestrus responses in goats, while season has been reported to influence the efficiency of <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> programmes. Increasing the dose levels of exogenous hormones in <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> protocols has caused variable and sometimes inconsistent effects. The effects of combining the male stimulus with exogenous hormones, seasonal variation, extra-label use of products and short-term nutritional manipulation on oestrus responses in goats require further evaluation.

One hundred and twenty cycling cows were equally divided among three pens. For the first three days of the experiment, nine cows were induced to display oestrus on each of the three days. On the first day, one cow was programmed in pen 1, in pen 2, and three in pen 3, The following day, the number of cows were three, one, and five, respectively, and on the third day, live, three, and one, in the respective pens. Nine other cows per pen were stimulated to show high levels of progesterone during the expected oestrus of the synchronised ones. The number of animals artificially induced into oestrus was directly related to the number of non-treated herd mates showing sexual behaviour (r = 0. 96, P 0. 05) in oestrous lengths, onset of oestrus, and sexual activity (mounts given and received) among treatments.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present research were to study {{the factors that influence}} postpartum reproductive characteristics of suckling beef cows in extensive production systems in Mozambique and to develop new management strategies to improve their reproductive efficiency. The effects and interactions between post-partum BW, BCS, age and parity number on plasma concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, creatinine, urea and cortisol around oestrus and the related conception rates of Bos indicus cows in extensive production system were analysed as well as the minimum BCS at the beginning of breeding to maximise the subsequent conception rates. Thirty-five days prior to the breeding season cows were synchronised using Crestar. During the second <b>oestrus</b> after <b>synchronisation,</b> 18 blood samples were collected per animal for hormonal analysis, from 24 hr before oestrus to 24 hr after oestrus. The hormonal pattern of estradiol and progesterone around oestrus were similar to that observed in Bos taurus cows under intensive conditions. Conception rates of cows in the experimental group were 90. 5 %. Better results on estradiol pattern and conception rates were related to a BCS of ≥ 2. 5 and it was thus concluded that the post-partum management of extensive Bos inducus cows should aim to achieve at least a BCS of 2. 5 {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season. Twelve-hour and 48 -hr calf removal were conducted separately to evaluate their effects on conception rates of Bos indicus beef cows in extensive production systems and to quantify the related effects on calf-weaning weights. The 12 -hr calf removal was performed from 45 days post-partum to the beginning of the breeding season, and the 48 -hr calf removal was performed preceding the onset of the breeding season. It was concluded that 12 -hr calf separation at night enhance the energy balance (3 %), increases the conception rates (80 %) and improves the calf-weaning weights, whereas 48 -hr calf removal increases conception rates (76 %) and does not affect calf weaning weights. Both calf removal management strategies concentrate conceptions in the early part of the breeding season and stress the importance of the effect of BCS and estradiol on conception rates in Bos indicus beef cows in extensive production systems.

40|$|Sheep of five* breeds {{imported}} into New Zealand and {{held at a}} quarantine farm were increased in number {{through the use of}} embryo transplantation (ET) procedures. For this, donor ewes after superovulation treatment were inseminated with fresh semen of rams of their own breed and flushed to recover embryos 5 or 6 day after onset of oestrus. The embryos after classification and processing through ten washes of flushing media were transported to a secondary quarantine farm and transferred into synchronised recipient Coopworth and Romney ewes. Some of the surrogate ewes received intravaginal progesterone supplementation (CIDR) for 14 days after transfer. Details of lamb production were recorded. This thesis reports the results of some factors that can affect the success of a commercial ET programme. Among the donor ewes 87 - 89 % of the animals were in <b>oestrus</b> after <b>synchronisation</b> and gonadotrophin treatment. The ewes not in heat often had low or absent superovulatory responses. Superovulation was induced with either FSH-P or Folltropin given as 7 or 8 intramuscular injections at 12 h interval begining 72 h before withdrawal of the progesterone treatment (CIDR). The gonadotrophin dose levels were modified according to the breed and also as the programme progressed. Most of the data were examined within breed. The superovulatory response to either the type of gonadotrophin preparation or the dose levels did not differ significantly. The variation in recovery rate of embryos was not affected by the type of gonadotrophin used, whether the animals treated were flushed on one or two occasions, whether flushing was done 5 or 6 days after oestrus, or according to the ovulatory response (classed as 1 - 8, 9 - 16 and > 16 corpora lrttea counted). Overall 85 % of the ova were fertilised and had developed into embryos. There {{were no significant differences in}} fertility between inseminations done in the morning or the afternoon, or when flushed once or twice, or when AI was followed by natural mating, or relative to the ovulatory response. Moreover there was no significant difference within the six breeds in the fertility rate. The quality of the embryos, classified as "good" or "poor" on the basis of their appearance and stage of development consistent with the day of flushing (developmental age), was. significantly affected in several of the breeds by the type of gonadotrophin, the dose levels, the ovulatory response and the age of the embryos when recovered. The pregnancy rate after the transfer of two embryos was 59 %, 72 %, 60 %, 53 %, 53 %, 46 % for recipients carrying DT,FT,FINN,GOT,OXD,WHM embryos, respectively. The comparable ·values for embryo survival were 46 %, 57 %, 54 %, 42 %, 40 %, 34 %, respectively. In general among the factors studied involving breed of recipient, degree of synchronisation between donor and recipient, ovulation rate in the recipient, interval from flushing to transplantation and progesterone supplementation it was found that only the latter factor in the DT, FT and OXD breeds of embryos was significant. The results from this multiplication programme after considering 409 treatments with gonadotrophin gave an average of 6. 0 corpora lutea, 3. 9 eggs recovered, 3. 4 eggs fertilised and 1. 5 lambs born per treatment. It is concluded that the low recovery rate and poor survival rate of the embryos are important factors to be overcome if a significant increase in the number of lambs born is to be expected from embryo transplantation. Work to overcome these problems is necessary, but attempts should also be made to increase the OR through modification of the gonadotrophin treatments. Support for this idea is suggested because in some animals with a high OR satisfactory numbers of eggs were fertilised and an increase of good quality embryos was recorded. * Texel (from two sources, Danish (DT) and Finnish (FT) and considered as separate breeds), Finnish Landrace (Finn), Gotland Pelt (Got), Oxford Down (OXD), White Headed Marsh (WHM) breeds...|$|R
40|$|Present {{research}} {{was carried out}} with the main objective {{to determine the effect}} of different sources and combinations of gonadotrophin for superovulation on ovarian responses and subsequent embryo transfer (ET) performance in goats. A total of 5 experiments had been designed. In Experiment 1, effect of supplementation of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) or gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) on ovulation and subsequent embryo production of equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) superovulated does were evaluated. In Experiment 2, effect of supplementation of hCG or GnRH on ovulation and subsequent embryo production of follicle stimulating hormone (pFSH) superovulated does were evaluated. The suitable gonadotrophin was selected from Experiments 1 and 2 for further research. In Experiment 3, effect of pFSH dosage based on body weight (BW) (3, 5 and 8 mg pFSH per kg BW) on superovulation performance was evaluated. In Experiment 4, effects of donor age (2 - 4 yr and > 4 yr) and body weight (BW) (15 - 25 kg and > 25 kg) on superovulation were evaluated. In Experiment 5, effect of recipient physical condition (surgery cycle) on pregnancy rate and subsequent kidding were evaluated. Oestrus was synchronised with a controlled intravaginal drug release device (CIDR) for 14 days and an i. m. injection of prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α) was carried out on Day 11. Subsequently superovulation was performed by using the exogenous gonadotrophin (eCG or pFSH) and initially administered on Day 12. eCG was administered with 1500 IU in a single injection and pFSH was administered with 6 decreasing dosages (0800 to 0900 hr and 1900 to 2000 hr) for 3 consecutive days. After CIDR removal, oestrus was observed 3 times every day. Natural mating and artificial insemination (AI) were performed after showing the <b>oestrus.</b> Recipient does <b>synchronisation</b> for ET was carried out by inserting CIDR for 14 days and an i. m. injection of 300 IU eCG on Day 12. Embryo flushing from donor does were carried out during the laparotomy session on Day 7 after CIDR removal, and subsequently embryos were transferred to the recipient does. The findings of the present research were as follows: a) hCG supplementation was needed for eCG-superovulated donor does for better ovulation synchronisation and structures recovery; b) for pFSHsuperovulated donor does, no difference was observed among the treatment groups; c) pFSH dosage based on BW had a significant effect on embryo production performances and 5 mg pFSH per kg BW performed better for embryo production; d) the donor does of 2 to 4 years of age and more than 25 kg BW performed better on the ovulation and embryo production performances; e) intact recipient does produced significantly higher number of pregnancy after ET than the recipient does used for different surgeries earlier. In conclusion, it was suggested that the dosage based on per kg BW as well as age and BW of the donor does affected the performances in ovarian response and embryo production of superovulated donor does for ET programme...|$|R
40|$|Although {{essential}} for artificial insemination (AI) and MOET (multiple ovulation and embryo transfer), <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> and superovulation {{are associated with}} increased female reproductive tract mucus production and altered sperm transport. The effects of such breeding practices on the ovine cervicovaginal (CV) mucus proteome have not been detailed. The {{aim of this study}} was to qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the Merino CV mucus proteome in naturally cycling (NAT) ewes at oestrus and mid-luteal phase, and quantitatively compare CV oestrus mucus proteomes of NAT, progesterone synchronised (P 4) and superovulated (SOV) ewes. Quantitative analysis revealed 60 proteins were more abundant during oestrus and 127 were more abundant during the luteal phase, with 27 oestrus specific and 40 luteal specific proteins identified. The oestrus proteins most disparate in abundance compared to mid-luteal phase were ceruloplasmin (CP), chitinase- 3 -like protein 1 (CHI 3 L 1), clusterin (CLU), alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) and mucin- 16 (MUC 16). Exogenous hormones greatly altered the proteome with 51 and 32 proteins more abundant and 98 and 53 proteins less abundant, in P 4 and SOV mucus, respectively when compared to NAT mucus. Investigation of the impact of these proteomic changes on sperm motility and longevity within mucus may help improve sperm transport and fertility following cervical AI.

40|$|Dairy farmers using {{artificial}} insemination (AI) {{are dependent on}} effective oestrus detection. In Sweden, AI is used {{for a majority of}} all dairy cows and <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> with hormones is not allowed. There are reports of declining ability to express oestrus with higher levels of milk production. This makes oestrus detection more difficult. Several aids for oestrus detection have been developed, for instance pedometers and mounting detectors. These aids can be used in loose housing systems and even though they can be very efficient, visual observations are still important for detection of possible missed or false registrations. Analysis of milk progesterone can be used to verify that an ovulation has occurred. Flooring and temperature influence the expression of oestrus. Lactation number, milk production, loose housing or tied system, season and feeding are examples of other factors that can influence oestrus expression. The chance of getting a cow pregnant seems to increase with a more obvious expression of oestrus. The ability to express oestrus has a low heritability and an unfavourable genetic correlation to milk production.

The 1. 5 and 2 mg dose of DEX was more effective in synchronising labour as regards the treatment to lambing interval and the proportion of ewes that gave birth within 3 days. However, obstetrical manipulations were needed, and dead lambs were born when 2 mg DEX was used.

40|$|Current <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> regimes for cattle {{are based}} on {{synchronising}} {{the end of the}} progestational phase of the oestrous cycle so that ovulation occurs simultaneously in treated animals. The end of the progestational phase can be synchronised through inducing premature luteolysis using prostaglandin F 2 α and its analogues or by artificially extending dioestrus using exogenous progesterone treatment. The time taken for subsequent follicular maturation and ovulation tends to be inconsistent between animals, which contributes to the poor fertility obtained following fixed-time insemination after <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> treatments. The variable rate of follicular development occurring after a synchronous decline in plasma progesterone levels is a major limiting factor in achieving a degree of synchrony of oestrus and ovulation which would allow for fixed-time insemination. Controlling the time of ovulation using exogenous oestrogen to induce a preovulatory LH surge is a potential method by which the variability in timing of ovulation may be reduced. Alternatively, re-setting follicular wave patterns in different animals at the commencement of synchrony treatments using exogenous oestrogen, so that follicular wave emergence is synchronised, is another method by which the variability in timing of ovulation could be reduced. A clinical trial was conducted involving 750 dairy heifers in 13 herds {{to determine the effects of}} 0. 5 mg oestradiol benzoate administered intramuscularly 24 hours after removal of progesterone-containing intravaginal devices (CIDR-B) on the occurrence and timing of oestrus, synchronised pregnancy rate and synchronised conception rate in dairy heifers. Within each herd heifers were randomly allocated to one of two <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> treatments. All heifers received a CIDR-B progesterone-containing intravaginal device with an attached 10 mg oestradiol benzoate capsule for 12 days. Twenty-four hours after CIDR-B removal one group received an intramuscular injection of 0. 5 mg oestradiol benzoate and the other group received an intramuscular injection of a placebo. Heifers were inseminated to detected oestrus 48 and 72 hours after device removal. Administration of oestradiol benzoate 24 hours after removal of CIDR-B devices significantly increased the number of heifers exhibiting oestrus within the observation period (96. 1 %; vs 90. 5 %, p < 0. 01). It also altered the onset of oestrus so that significantly more heifers were in oestrus (86. 6 % vs 72. 3 %, p< 0. 01) and conceived (47. 1 % vs 37, 5 %, p< 0. 05) by 48 hours after device removal. The overall synchronised conception rate and synchronised pregnancy rate were unaffected by treatment. The effects of the same <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> treatment, on the time to oestrus, ovulation, and peak LH concentration were examined in dairy heifers. Treatment with oestradiol benzoate tended to reduce the time from device removal to LH peak in randomly cycling heifers (median time to LH peak 40. 1 hr vs 63. 9 hr, p= 0. 07), but treatment with oestradiol had no significant effect on the time to LH peak, standing oestrus or ovulation in heifers synchronised during late dioestrus. The effects of oestradiol benzoate on the dominant follicle and corpus luteum of cows treated with progesterone (CIDR-B) at different stages of the oestrous cycle were investigated. Treatment with oestradiol benzoate on day 3 of the oestrous cycle caused atresia of the dominant follicle present at CIDR-B insertion and resulted in the early emergence of the subsequent follicular wave. Treatment with oestradiol benzoate on days 6, 9, 12 and 15 of the oestrous cycle had no effect on follicular characteristics or the emergence of the subsequent follicular wave. Treatment with oestradiol benzoate had no effect on the day of onset of regression of the corpus luteum regardless of the stage of the oestrous cycle at CIDR-B insertion. The effectiveness of re-using CIDR-B devices to synchronise returns to oestrus in non-pregnant dairy heifers was examined. After an initial CIDR-B synchronisation programme in dairy heifers, the used CIDR-B devices were re-inserted 14 or 16 days after first insemination, for a period of 5 days. Re-insertion of used CIDR-B devices significantly increased the number of non-pregnant heifers detected in oestrus and inseminated by 48 hours after device removal (45. 2 % vs 27. 3 %, p< 0. 05, in herds where CIDR's were re-inserted on day 14; 48. 8 % vs 13. 6 %, p< 0. 05, in herds where CIDR's were re-inserted on day 16). Re-insertion at 14 or 16 days after first insemination was equally effective in increasing visible returns to service. Conception rate was unaffected by CIDR-B treatment. In conclusion, intramuscular administration of oestradiol benzoate 24 hours after the removal of CIDR-B progesterone-containing intravaginal devices increases the number of heifers exhibiting oestrus at an earlier time after device removal. The administration of oestradiol benzoate appears to reduce the variability in timing of LH peaks typically occurring in a herd of synchronised heifers due to different stages of follicular development being present at the time of CIDR-B removal. Treatment with oestradiol benzoate at the start of CIDR-B treatment appears to have no significant effect on synchronising follicular wave emergence in different animals other than those in early metoestrus. Administration of oestradiol benzoate after treatment with exogenous progesterone therefore appears to offer the most potential in controlling the time of oestrus and ovulation and allowing for fixed-time insemination...|$|E
40|$|COMPARISON OF TWO PREGNANCY TEST RESULTS USING MILK PROGESTERONE KITS IN ETAWAH CROSS GOATSABSTRACTThis study aims {{to compare}} the {{effectiveness}} of the milk progesterone kits in two different diagnosis schedules namely at day 18 to 22 and day 40 to 44 following service. This research used 8 lactating Ettawa cross goats with the age of between 2 to 2. 5 years old and their average weight were 30 kgs. One buck was used in this experiment at the age of between 4 to 4. 5 years old and its weight was roughly 70 kgs. All goats were subject to <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> protocol using progesterone implant followed by prostaglandin administration. At oestrous detection, only 4 out of 8 female goats showed oestrous signs and one female goats was in oestrous naturally. Early pregnancy diagnosis using the milk progesterone kits were carried out in 5 goats. The result of this study showed that the accuracy of the kits for early pregnancy diagnosis protocol could reach 100 % for a non-pregnant status. It can be concluded that the repeated pregnancy diagnosis schedule at day 40 - 44 following service was not necessarily recomended for a field practices.

40|$|Exposure of {{previously}} isolated anoestrous ewes to a ram induces an almost instantaneous rise in luteinising hormone (LH) pulse frequency. This physiological response, a phenomenon coined 'the ram effect' is commonly sufficient {{to override the}} seasonal suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and induce a synchronous first ovulation. The objective of the first series of experiments in this thesis {{was to develop a}} nonpharmacological method of <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation,</b> using socio-sexual cues, for natural mating of mule ewes during the breeding season. Initially two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of short-term fence line and vasectomised ram exposure repeated every 17 days on three occasions during the transition into the breeding season. Ewes repeatedly exposed to the ram had a significantly compacted mating period compared to ewes maintained in isolation from rams prior to mating. This compaction persisted through to lambing with no significant negative effect on litter size. Artificially inseminated ewes synchronised using the above method of ram synchronisation had higher conception rates than progestagen synchronised ewes. The second objective was to compare the efficacy of different durations and frequencies of ram exposures as methods of <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation.</b> Ewes maintained continuously with rams over the pre-mating period had a more compacted mating and lambing period than ewes exposed intermittently to rams. Maiden ewes typically show a poorer level of reproductive competence than adult ewes. Similarly maiden ewes induced to ovulate using the ram effect have been found to have a lower ovulatory response. The next objective of this thesis was to determine if pre-exposure to the ram during anoestrus or the breeding season would modulate the hormonal and behavioural responses of maiden ewes when re-introduced to rams during the breeding season or anoestrus. There was no major effect of prior experience of the ram on any parameters of the LH response to ram introduction. However ewes with prior ram experience did have more positive interactions with the rams and demonstrated more ram seeking behaviour. Incorporation of socio-sexual cues with artificial methods of reproductive control has to date been restricted to ram exposure post progestagen sponge withdrawal. Therefore the final objective of this thesis was to investigate the effect of ram exposure towards the end of a progestagen synchronisation protocol on ewe fertility. There {{was no significant difference in}} conception rates between ram exposed and control ewes, however ram exposed ewes had a significant depression in mean litter size due to a greater number of ewes having single lambs. The studies in this thesis show a robust and repeatable endocrine response to ram introduction in mule ewes exposed to the ram during the transition between anoestrus and the breeding season. The potency of the socio-sexual cues from the ram permits modification of the distribution of oestrus within randomly cycling ewes. The findings in this thesis highlight the potential for application and development of pre-mating strategies using socio-sexual cues within seasonal breeds of sheep.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of CIDR devices (AHI, NZ) used either alone or combined with prostaglandins to synchronise oestrus was evaluated in {{a herd of}} lactating dairy c o ws l Onset of oestrus and fertility to artificial insemination (A.

Group 2, a CIDR was inserted for 12 days followed by A. I. at observed oestrus after CIDR removal. Group 3, a CIDR was inserted for 7 days with a luteolytic dose of prostaglandin F 2 a analogue administered on day 6. All animals were inseminated at 63 h after CIDR removal followed by A. I. at observed oestrus. The proportions of cows showing oestrus during the first 5 days were 22 %, 78 % and 87 X, and by 25 days were 85 %, 92 % and 98 % for groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. In group 3, 83 % of animals had exhibited oestrus and 49 % subsequently conceived to A. I. at the fixed time of 63 h. Pregnancy rates after 25 days of mating as determined by rectal palpation were 46 %, 62 % and 64 % for groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. These results demonstrate that the CIDR is an effective device for synchronisation of oestrus in dairy cows, and when used in combination with luteolytic prostaglandins this synchronisation is sufficiently precise for successful A.

40|$|Recommendations for <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> {{of dairy}} heifers using progesterone-containing intravaginal devices suggest re-insertion of used devices 16 days after first {{insemination}} {{for a period}} of 5 days to allow a second opportunity for artificial insemination. Controlled studies on the effectiveness of re-using intravaginal devices to synchronise returns to oestrus in non-pregnant dairy heifers are lacking. A clinical trial was conducted involving 750 Friesian heifers in 13 herds. After an initial synchronisation programme, the used intravaginal devices were re-inserted 14 or 16 days after first insemination into half of the heifers in each herd {{for a period of}} 5 days. After the first synchronisation programme, 47. 5 % of heifers remained non-pregnant. Re-insertion of used intravaginal devices for 5 days significantly increased the number of non-pregnant heifers detected in oestrus and inseminated by 48 hours after device removal compared to heifers in which devices were not re-inserted (45. 2 % v. 27. 3 %, p < 0. 05, in herds where intravaginal devices were re-inserted on day 14; 48. 8 % v. 13. 6 %, p < 0. 05, in herds where intravaginal devices were re-inserted on day 16). Re-insertion at 14 or 16 days after first insemination was equally effective in increasing visible returns to service. However, the number of non-pregnant heifers synchronised for a second round of artificial insemination was less than expected. Conception rate to the re-synchronised oestrus was unaffected by the treatment. It is concluded that the additional procedures of CIDR re-insertion, removal, tailpainting and insemination involved in there-synchrony programme, and the relatively low in-calf rate to the re-synchronised round of insemination, reduced the potential benefits of re-synchronisation.

40|$|A JASSA {{study to}} compare the {{reproductive}} performance of yearling heifers with that of two year old heifers and to determine whether hormone addition could improve fertility in yearling beef heifers. The objective {{of this study was}} {{to compare the}} reproductive performance of yearling heifers with that of two year old heifers and to determine whether <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and prostaglandin F 2 a(PGF 2 a) could improve fertility in yearling beef heifers. The experiment was conducted at Grasslands Research Station, Marondera, Zimbabwe from October 1997 to July 1998. Supplementary feeding of 52 Tuli yearling heifers, seven to nine months old, was initiated at the beginning of the experiment. This was done to ensure that the heifers would have attained a target breeding weight of 260 to 300 kg (60 to 65 percent of the mature cow body weight) by 13 to 15 months of age. The yearling heifers and 20 two year old heifers were observed for signs of oestrus starting two months prior to the onset of breeding. At 13 to 15 months of age the yearling heifers weighed on average 265 ± 15 kg. The heifers were randomly divided into two equal groups, and one group was synchronised for oestrus with GnRH (2 ml Receptal® per injection) and PGF 2 a (1 ml Prosolvin® per injection) given six days later. All heifers then ran with three Tuli bulls over a 60 day breeding period. Blood samples were taken for plasma progesterone concentration determination. The pre-breeding mean interval between oestruses for yearling heifers was longer (21. 9 ± 1. 6 d vs 17. 7 ± 1. 0 d; P 0. 05) between synchronised and non-synchronised heifers. The results indicated that yearling Tuli heifers showed normal oestrous activity but had lower conception rates than the two year old heifers. In addition, the results showed that reproductive performance of the yearling heifers was not improved by synchronising oestrus with GnRH and PGF 2 a and that there was little benefit in breeding Tuli heifers below 280 kg body weight...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to develop an embryo {{transfer}} programme under farm conditions. For this embryos were collected from donor ewes 5 - 6 days after single-sire mating by rams of the same crossbreed as the ewes. Then the embryos were transplanted soon after collection or after they had been initially frozen and later on thawed before their transfer. To enable this study to be carried out, one hundred and sixty-one Booroola-Merino x Perendale ewes aged between 3 and 6 years and of 34 - 69 kg live weight were examined. These animals were classified as either carriers (F+) or non-carriers (++) of the fecundity gene {{on the basis of}} the number of ovulations recorded at laparoscopy carried out a few days after progestagen sponge treatment to induce <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation,</b> and in a few cases on the basis of previous lambing data. The aims of the study therefore were also to identify ewe carriers or non-carriers of the fecundity gene, and to evaluate their ovulatory response to several doses of Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotrophin (Tl=O, T 2 = 350, T 3 = 700 and T 4 = 1050 i. u. of PMSG) given during the embryo transfer programme. On the basis of the criteria used to classify F+ and ++ ewes, 76 ewes were considered as carriers and 85 as non-carriers of the fecundity gene. Immediately after progestagen synchronisation treatment the incidence of oestrus and the distribution of onset of oestrus was similar in both groups of ewes, and also following PMSG treatment given in the succeeding cycle. Ovulation rate after the progestagen sponge treatment was significantly affected by genotype and age of the ewes, but it was not associated with the live weight of the ewes. The least-squares means for number of ovulations in F+ and ++ ewes and in 3 and 4 - 6 years old animals were 3. 02, 1. 73, 2. 14 and 2. 45 respectively. Higher sensitivity to PMSG treatment was observed from the right ovary than from the left ovary (3. 40 v. 2. 82 ovulations respectively). No significant effect of dose of PMSG was found on the percentage of embryos recovered, the overall recovery rate being 66 %. Of the ova or potential embryos recovered 78 % had been fertilised and had developed to embryos. There were no significant differences between the 3 rams in the fertilisation rate in the ewes compared on a per ewe basis. The reproductive performance of donor ewes which had been flushed, was considerably influenced by the efficiency of the embryo recovery procedures, since every embryo not recovered represents a potential pregnancy and such a situation sometimes is not desirable. In this study 30 % of the ewes that were flushed, subsequently became pregnant and produce lambs as a result of one or more embryos not being recovered at surgery. The number of ovulations after PMSG treatment was significantly affected by the dose-level of PMSG and the genotype, age and live weight of the ewes. F+ ewes recorded a significantly higher ovulation rate than ++ ewes. Their respective least-squares means were 3. 61 and 2. 31 corpora lutea. No significant difference was found between treatments 1 and 2 and between treatments 3 and 4. However, the response from the last two treatments was significantly higher than that from the first two treatments. Their respective least-squares means were 2. 10, 2. 01, 3. 74 and 4. 37 corpora lutea. Ewes 4 - 6 years old recorded a significantly higher number of ovulations than younger ewes (3 years old). Small significant effect of live weight was found on the ovulatory response of the ewes. Analysis within each genotype showed a similar trend in both genotypes, but small significant effect of weight was only detected in the ++ ewes. The pregnancy rate that occurred after the transfer of two fresh embryos (86 %) was significantly affected by the genotype of the recipient ewe (F+ ewes 75 % v. ++ ewes 96 %). The number of ovulations in the recipients and whether or not they had received PMSG before transfer had no effect on the incidence of pregnancy. The pregnancy rate achieved after the transfer of frozen embryos (35 %) was significantly influenced by the number of embryos transferred, but not by the ovulation rate in the recipient ewe or the time elapsing from flushing until freezing. Pregnancy rate was significantly higher after the transfer of 2 embryos compared to the transfer of single embryos (43 % v. 0 %), but only 8 transfers were made in the later category. On the basis of the number of ovulations, it can be concluded that ewe carriers of the fecundity gene recorded significantly higher ovulation rate after <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> and were more sensitive to PMSG stimulation than non-carrier ewes. There was an encouraging pregnancy rate obtained with frozen embryos, even although the small number of transfers carried out limits conclusions that can be drawn. However, the eighty-six percent pregnancy rate achieved after the transfer of two fresh embryos per recipient, shows the feasibility of the embryo transfer programmme under conditions where suitable recipients are available. Where recipients are limited then additional embryos might be frozen and stored until ready for transplantation...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} 272 beef heifers were studied from {{just prior to}} their first {{breeding}} season (15 October 2003), through their second breeding season and until just after they had weaned their first calves in March 2005. The study consisted of two main parts: in the first part, heifers were randomly allocated to either a synchronised TEST group or an unsynchronised CONTROL group. The TEST group received artificial insemination (AI) for 6 days followed by prostaglandin F 2 á (PGF) treatment on day 6 (PGF/ 6) and further AI {{for a total of}} 50 days, which was followed after a 6 day break by a 42 day bull breeding season. The CONTROL group were bred for the same period without PGF treatment. Synchronisation resulted in a reduction in days to first insemination (P < 0. 01) and days to calving (P = 0. 04). No significant difference could be demonstrated in pregnancy rate to the 50 day AI season (60. 0 % vs. 51. 8 %, TEST and CONTROL groups respectively, P = 0. 18), final pregnancy rate (82. 2 % vs. 83. 2 %, P = 0. 87) or pregnancy rate to the subsequent breeding season (96. 0 % vs. 95. 0 %, P = 1. 00). A significant increase in mean weaning mass of the calves due to synchronisation could not be demonstrated (207. 0 kg vs. 201. 4 kg, TEST and CONTROL groups respectively, P = 0. 32). However, data from this study were used to calculate the benefit:cost ratio, and a value of 2. 8 was reached, representing the return on investment for the synchronisation protocol under these circumstances. It was concluded from this study that a PGF/ 6 protocol may lead to a change in the total mass of calves weaned by changing days to calving and thus weaning mass, birth mass of calves, weaning rate and/or the ratio of male:female calves born. It was further concluded that a practical way to predict the cost effectiveness of an <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> protocol is to determine the ratio between the total cost of the programme and the price of weaner calves per kg live mass. This ratio represents the minimum increase in mean weaning mass that has to be achieved for the programme to be cost effective if no increase in weaning rate is achieved. In the second part of this study, reproductive tract scoring (RTS) was performed on the same group of heifers one day before the onset of their first breeding season. The effect of RTS on several reproduction and production outcomes was tested, and the association of RTS with the outcomes was compared to the associations of other input variables such as mass, age, body condition score (BCS) and Kleiber ratio using multiple or univariable linear or logistic regression. RTS was associated with pregnancy rate to the 50 day AI season (P < 0. 01), days to calving (r = 0. 28, P < 0. 01), calf weaning mass (r = 0. 22, P < 0. 01) and pregnancy rate to the subsequent breeding season (P < 0. 01). These associations were mostly independent of associations with mass, age and BCS before the onset of the first breeding season. RTS was a better predictor of fertility than was Kleiber ratio, and similar in its prediction of calf weaning mass. It was concluded from this study that RTS is a unique predictor of heifer fertility, compares well with (but is independent of) other traits used as a predictor of production outcomes and {{is likely to be a}} good predictor of life production of the cow.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} {{of a series of}} studies on aspects of the reproductive performance of dairy cows in New Zealand. The studies of ovarian activity in post-partum dairy cows by ultrasound examinations were conducted in a spring- and an autumn-calving herd. This study showed that there is seasonal variation in the initiation of post-partum ovarian function in dairy cows in New Zealand, and this influences some aspects of reproduction. The interval from calving to the first post-partum ovulation in the autumn-calving herd was significantly shorter than that in the spring calving herd. Other reproductive indices were shorter in the spring-calving herd. The mean milk progesterone concentration during the dioestrous phase(Day 7 - 16) of the normal first cycle for cows in the spring-calving herd was significantly higher than in animals in the autumn-calving herd. In addition, the mean number of follicles in each of the follicle-size categories from 11 days before the first ovulation in spring-calving cows was significantly higher than in autumn-calving cows. There were three wave-like patterns in the mean size of the largest follicle during the first normal cycle. The patterns of the mean number of each follicle category and the mean size of the largest follicle in cows which had a shortened first cycle were similar to those seen in the first two stages of a normal first cycle. The follicular patterns in cows which had a short first cycle were also the same as those in the first stage of a normal first cycle. The use of gonadotrophin releasing hormone(GnRH) in post-partum anoestrous dairy cows in a spring-calving herd showed that the GnRH injection could induce luteinising hormone(LH) release and ovulations The study of ovarian activity post-injection showed that the GnRH-induced LH release was associated with an increase in average number of medium follicles(MF's) and a decrease in large follicles(LF's) in the ovaries of treated cows. Treated cows ovulated 4. 7 ± 2. 6 days post-injection, while only one control cow ovulated on the equivalent of Day 5 post-injection. The reproductive indices in treated cows were improved, compared with untreated controls. Oestrous behaviour was studied in a group of sixteen Taurindicus heifers(Sahiwalx Holstein Friesian crossbreds) after <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> treatment by using a CIDR {Control Intravaginal Drug Release) device. It was found that these animals preferred to be mounted rather than to mount when in oestrus. The mean interval from CIDR removal to the onset of oestrus was 31. 5 ± 2. 3 h, with the mean duration of oestrus(8. 3 ± 1. 9 h). The use of visual observation in combination with tailpaint scoring could detect all oestrous animals. The DairyMAN programme was used to analyse breeding records from two intensively managed research dairy herds. Results from analyses produced by the programme were used to monitor and compare against standard or target values. The results showed that reproductive performance in the two herds was above target values. The increase in the use of hormonal treatment such as prostaglandin F 2 α to synchronise oestrus and/or to increase fertility of a herd, concomitantly with improvement in oestrus detection efficiency, resulted in an increase in submission rates and conception rates in these herds. Nutritional supply before and after calving can reduce reproductive performance of a herd. Relatively low reproductive performances were obtained in both herds during the 1985 season in which pasture growth was badly affected by climatic conditions. This was reflected in the lower occurrence of +PMH(behavioural oestrus events recorded before the mating period commences) in the No 2 herd in 1985 (61 %), compared with a target value of 85 %, whereas the average of all 7 years was 80 %. The conception rates of the herd were also affected as the first service pregnancy rate(PR) was only 43 %, compared with a target value of 59 %. The average of all 7 years was 56 %. Relatively high reproductive performance was obtained in 1986. The submission rates(SR) at 3 and 4 weeks after Planned Start of Mating(PSM) were 94 and 100 %, respectively, compared with target values of 90 and 100 %, respectively. In addition, the occurrence of +PMH was high in 1986 (90 %), compared with a target value of 85 % and an average of all 7 years(80 %). The first service PR was also high in 1986 (71 %). The proportional incidences of short return to service intervals(1 - 17 days) were high(32 to 57 %) in the No 1 herd which used natural mating, compared with 6 to 22 % in the No 2 herd which used artificial insemination...|$|E
40|$|The aim of <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronisation</b> in cattle is {{to achieve}} a close {{synchrony}} of oestrus and ovulation with high submission rates. The status of follicular wave development {{at the time of}} treatment has been responsible for {{a large portion of the}} variability in ovarian response to treatments employed. The control of oestrus and ovulation require firstly that the life span of the corpus luteum is reduced, and secondly that follicular wave emergence is synchronized so that a healthy, oestrogen active dominant follicle is present at the end of the treatment. A clinical trial was conducted to determine the effective dosage of oestradiol bezoate in combination with progesterone on follicular dynamics, oestrous behaviour and time of ovulation when treatment was administered intravaginally. Intravaginal treatment with 2 mg or 7 mg oestradiol benzoate and progesterone on day 3 of the oestrous cycle was effective in inducing atresia of the dominant follicle and a new cohort of follicles began to emerge, on average, 2. 5 ± 0. 93 days after treatment. However, the IBD Onsettl 2 TM drug adminstration device, failed to maintain the required progesterone output and plasma concentrations during the treatment period. This resulted in failure to synchronize oestrus and ovulation. IBD Onsett 12 TM, as a single application intravaginal drug delivery device for the purpose of controlling the oestrus cycle in cattle, was further evaluated in cycling and non-cycling cows and compared to the CIDR oestrus synchronization program. A total of 350 Friesian or Friesian cross cows in five herds were involved in the trial. The retention rate for the IBD Onsett 12 TM was significantly lower than the CEDR (65. 12 % vs. 99. 44 %, χ 2 = 73. 528, P = 0. 001), and the synchronized conception rate from the CIDR protocol was significantly higher than the IBD Onsett 12 TM among cycling and non-cycling cows (χ 2 = 15. 087, P = 0. 02). The IBD Onsett 12 oestrus synchronization program was effective in inducing fertile synchronized oestrus in some cycling and non-cycling cows, but resulted in a low synchronized conception rate. Manipulation of follicular development and controlling the oestrous cycle length will synchronize oestrus more precisely and control the time of ovulation more exactly to allow a single fixed-time insemination. Controlling the time of new follicular wave emergence and synchronizing the follicular wave status in dairy cows at random stages of the oestrous cycle would provide a more practical and less variable method of synchronization than those of the past. A clinical trial was conducted to control both follicular development and luteal function. Twenty randomly cycling, non-lactating dairy cows were randomly assigned to two treatments; 1) 2 mg oestradiol benzoate injected intramuscularly and 200 mg of progesterone subcutaneously, 9 days before prostaglandin (500 μg cloprostenol) and a second injection of 1 mg oestradiol benzoate 24 hours after prostaglandin treatment (ODB, n = 10). 2) 10 μg busereiin injected 7 days before prostaglandin (500 μg cloprostenol) and a second injection of 10 μg busereiin 48 hours after prostaglandin treatment (GnRH, n = 10). An acute short-acting treatment with progesterone and oestradiol benzoate or busereiin was effective in inducing atresia of the dominant follicle. A new follicular wave emerged earlier in the GnRH treated group than in the ODB treated group (2. 22 ± 0. 15 vs. 3. 60 ± 0. 22 days, P = 0. 001). An LH surge occurred earlier after a second buserelin treatment on day 9 than after a second oestradiol benzoate treatment on day 10 (4. 0 ± 1. 0 vs. 22. 80 ± 1. 20 hour, P = 0. 001). The mean time of ovulation after the second oestradiol benzoate or buserelin treatment was not significantly different between the ODB and the GnRH group (1. 70 ± 0. 30 vs. 1. 56 ± 0. 18, P = 0. 692). The proportion of cows that were observed in oestrus was higher in the ODB group than the GnRH group (100 % vs. 55. 6 %, χ 2 = 5. 630, P = 0. 018). In conclusion, progesterone and oestradiol treatment intravaginally or intramuscularlly was effective in synchronizing follicular wave emergence. Administration of oestradiol benzoate 24 hours after prostaglandin given 9 days after an initial progesterone and oestradiol treatment produced the oestrus synchrony, induced an LH surge and provide a degree of synchrony in the time of ovulation. This program showed potential in manipulating follicular development and luteal function and has the possibility allowing fixed-time insemination. However, the efficacy of the EBD Onsett 12 TM as a single application intravaginal drug delivery device to control the oestrous cycle or as progesterone-releasing device in cattle did not demonstrate satisfactory results when used in these trials. This might arise from the complexity of the drug delivery system. Nevertheless, the concept of delivering multiple drugs at different rates and times may have many benefits to the end user when current design and use problems arc resolved...|$|E
