5|$|Feeling {{the need}} to seek out truth creates a {{separation}} between {{the mind of a}} poet and the mind of a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E

500|$|Spacey viewed {{continuing}} to portray Underwood {{for a second}} season as a continuing learning process. [...] "There is so much I don't know about Francis, so much that I'm learning ... I've always thought that the profession closest to that of an actor is being a detective ... We are given clues by writers, sometimes clues they're aware of and sometimes not. Then you lay them all <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to make them come alive as a character who's complex and surprising, maybe even to yourself". Gerald McRaney spoke about his expanded role by saying that whereas in season 1 the challenge to playing his character, Raymond Tusk, was in [...] "having to learn Mandarin", in season 2 his character has become [...] "somebody who you don't know which color hat he's wearing".|$|E

500|$|In {{terms of}} production, Hill collaborated {{with a group}} of musicians known as New Ark, {{consisting}} of Vada Nobles, Rasheem Pugh, Tejumold Newton, and Johari Newton. Hill later said that she wanted to [...] "write songs that lyrically move me and have the integrity of reggae and the knock of hip-hop and the instrumentation of classic soul" [...] and that the production on the album was intended to make the music sound raw and not computer-aided. Hill spoke of pressure from her label to emulate Prince, wherein all tracks would be credited as written and produced by the artist with little outside help. She also wanted to be appreciated as an auteur as much as Jean had within the Fugees. (She also saw a feminist cause: [...] "But step <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> and control things and there are doubts. This is a very sexist industry. They'll never throw the 'genius' title to a sister.") While recording the album, when Hill was asked about providing contracts or documentation to the musicians, she replied, [...] "We all love each other. This ain't about documents. This is blessed." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for GamePro, Captain Squideo called Destruction Derby [...] "the most raucous racing {{experience}} of the fall". He believed that its [...] "graphics are almost all you could want for a game" [...] of this type, but wrote that [...] "nothing here stands out as graphically spectacular". He complained that the game does not let players customise cars, and he disliked its lack of split-screen multiplayer. He summarised, [...] "Limited options keep Destruction Derby out of the winner's circuit, but this rowdy stock-car racer still generates a stadium full of thrashin' fun." [...] Victor Lucas of The Electric Playground stated that [...] "the beauty of the game" [...] is the strategy involved in making [...] "calculated strikes" [...] against enemy vehicles, and he wrote, [...] "If you go all <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to make big noise on the track, more than likely you'll be limping to the scrap yard in seconds." [...] He believed that the game's Stock Car racing mode [...] "is {{no match for the}} white knuckle inertia of either Wipeout or Ridge Racer", and that the demolition derbies in The Bowl were [...] "most fun to be had" [...] in the game. He praised the game's graphics and physics, and concluded, [...] "Destruction Derby is a winner in every capacity." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation was extremely pleased with the concept of smashing into other cars, saying it taps into a near-universal fantasy. He remarked the single-player mode is indefinably [...] "lacking" [...] but the multiplayer offers unqualified enjoyment.|$|E
500|$|... "Ride Me to Hell" [...] {{was written}} by Mike Rowe and {{directed}} by Aaron Augenblick and series creator Devin Clark. Screenwriter and executive producer Daniel Powell said that the episode explores [...] "a little bit more" [...] about Mark's background, particularly that his father left {{him when he was}} younger, and that it [...] "sort of informs why he became a social worker". Unlike the series' first season, which paid homage mainly to horror films, season two referenced a variety of genres. In an interview with Matt Barone of the magazine Complex, Clark used [...] "Ride Me to Hell" [...] as an example that the season [...] "taps into a little bit beyond the horror culture". He referred it to as [...] "one of our big episodes" [...] and stated that it references contemporary shows with [...] "unsatisfied endings", such as Monk and Lost. In the episode, Grimes unleashes memories of being a cop in the 1970s, which Clark saw as an opportunity to make fun of 1970s cop shows, such as CHiPs and Starsky and Hutch. He said, [...] "It's always a fun opportunity to see what other worlds I can pull from, even beyond horror. We had some really fun opportunities this season to pull from old '70s cop shows. ... So, it's fun for me just to step <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> lots of different styles and looks. I'm excited for whatever the writers throw at me, thematically. It's just a new opportunity to try something different." [...] "Ride Me to Hell" [...] was the fifth episode to be produced for the second season. In addition to the regular cast, the episode features appearances by recurring guest voice actors Pete Holmes, Julie Klausner and Mike O'Gorman.|$|E

2500|$|The {{riders in}} the hippika gymnasia were armed with dummy {{javelins}} and darts that they employed in mock battles. According to Arrian, the riders would divide into two teams, {{one of which}} would be the attacking side and one the defenders. They used their shields to cover their own and their horses' backs, forming a type of mobile testudo. Two of the defenders would stand in front of their team, acting as targets for the throws of the other side. The attackers were tested on their accuracy in hitting the two defenders, who in turn would attempt to protect themselves with their shields. Some of the other defenders would ride <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to hit the passing attackers. This was a challenging exercise, as Arrian noted: ...|$|E
2500|$|In a December 2016 {{interview}} with The Ex-Man, despite an ongoing [...] "huge legal battle" [...] with Bell and Cazares, former bassist-guitarist Christian Olde Wolbers {{stated that he}} has been [...] "trying to reach <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to get this reunion thing happening." [...] He added, [...] "There would be nothing better for this band [...] to reconcile our differences, fucking write a killer record, which I know we can, and fucking we would be doing really big tours. My passion for playing and what we have invested in this band is very big, and I know it's really big for Dino as well, 'cause he started it with Raymond back in the day." [...] More fuel to the possibility of a reunion with the [...] "classic" [...] lineup of Bell, Cazares, Wolbers and Herrera was added later that month, when Wolbers posted an image on his Instagram account, suggesting Fear Factory's official website was [...] "under construction." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dewey's biographer Richard Norton Smith wrote, [...] "For fifteen years... {{these two}} combatants waged {{political}} warfare. Their dispute pitted East against Midwest, city against countryside, internationalist against isolationist, pragmatic liberals against principled conservatives. Each man thought himself the genuine spokesman of the future; each denounced {{the other as}} a political heretic." [...] In a 1949 speech, Dewey criticized Taft and his followers by saying that [...] "we have in our party some fine, high-minded patriotic people who honestly oppose farm price supports, unemployment insurance, old age benefits, slum clearance, and other social programs... these people believe in a laissez-faire society and look back wistfully to the miscalled 'good old days' of the nineteenth century... if such efforts {{to turn back the}} clock are actually pursued, you can bury the Republican Party as the deadest pigeon in the country." [...] He added that people who opposed such social programs should [...] "go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to get elected in a typical American community and see what happens to them. But they ought not to do it as Republicans." ...|$|E
