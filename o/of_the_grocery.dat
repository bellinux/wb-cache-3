Yet Hill refused to explain further, even after he was accused <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> store murders {{on the basis of his}} injury. Hill was convicted of the murders in a controversial trial. Following an unsuccessful appeal, political debates, and international calls for clemency from high-profile figures and workers' organizations, Hill was executed in November 1915. After his death, he was memorialized by several folk songs. His life and death have inspired books and poetry.|$|E

500|$|After {{the failure}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> store in Arkansas in 1886, Zimmerman {{returned}} to the family farm and became a gentleman farmer. After Zimmerman returned, his father gave a small acreage of the Hinde farm to Zimmerman's half brother John H. Zimmerman, who raised pigs and farmed the acreage until he sold the property to Zimmerman several years later. Zimmerman was given title to the Hinde family farm by his father on July 13, 1902 after he married Agnes Oldendorf (1872–1922). [...] Agnes {{was the daughter of}} Peter and Mary S. Oldendorf who ran a music business and were retail liquor dealers in Mount Carmel. The brother of Zimmerman's wife, Charles Oldendorf, who served as mayor of Mount Carmel, Illinois during the late 1890s, encouraged Zimmerman to join the fraternal organization the Knights of Pythias. [...] In 1906, Zimmerman became chancellor commander of the Knights of Pythias lodge in Wabash County, Illinois and was a Captain in the uniform rank of the order.|$|E
500|$|In 1883, {{at the age}} of nineteen, Zimmerman and {{his cousin}} Harry Hinde were invited by Zimmerman's uncle Edmund C. Hinde to move to Fort Smith, Arkansas, where Hinde lived {{following}} his return from the California Gold Rush. After moving to Fort Smith, they owned and operated a grocery store from 1883 to 1886. Judge Isaac Parker at this time {{was in the process of}} eradicating the brothels, saloons, and outlaws that had taken over Fort Smith through increased public hangings and stiffer criminal penalties and this general lawless environment made operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> store difficult. [...] Interestingly, this period in the history of Fort Smith, Arkansas has been memorialized in the novel True Grit, and the two movies it inspired, True Grit (1969) and True Grit (2010). [...] The grocery store was a failure, and they were forced to sell the business and return to Mount Carmel, Illinois, but Zimmerman remained close to his cousin Harry Hinde, who later was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives, operated several businesses, and speculated in real estate. In later years, along with their uncle Charles T. Hinde, they invested in real estate and mines in New Mexico. [...] The New Mexico properties only returned modest profits but were kept in the family until the 1950s.|$|E
500|$|The {{only member}} of the group born in Skagen, Anna Ancher (1859–1935), was the {{daughter}} of Erik Brøndum, the owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> shop and guest house which later became Brøndums Hotel. Inspired by the artists who stayed there, she received her first lessons from Karl Madsen, Viggo Johansen and Michael Ancher. From 1875, she spent several winters in Copenhagen at Vilhelm Kyhn's school for women painters. As a result of her portraits of family and friends as well as her skills as a colourist, she is considered to be one of Denmark's finest artists although her talents were not fully appreciated until after her death. Her works depict scenes from the home, children and women and religious life in Skagen. She now stands out as a pioneer at a time when women were not expected to become artists and were not admitted to the Royal Danish Academy. Unlike her husband, she adopted a style of Realism, inspired above all by Christian Krohg. Commenting on her [...] (1882) in which the face is illuminated in an otherwise dark portrait, Madsen pointed out that she was the first Danish artist to depict a sunbeam. Her most cherished works include [...] (1886), Sunlight in the Blue Room (1891) and [...] (1903).|$|E

Upon his departure, Parcells famously stated: [...] "They want you to cook the dinner; at least they ought to let you shop for some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groceries.</b> Okay?" [...] This was mainly in reference to an incident in the Patriots' war room during the 1996 Draft. Parcells wanted to draft DE Tony Brackens with their first-round choice, but was vetoed by Kraft.

30|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this {{empirical}} {{paper is}} to {{shed some light on}} price dispersion and search behavior in <b>the</b> Spanish online <b>grocery</b> sector.

Most brick-and-mortar chains have already committed to this e-grocery segment, and most supermarket chains are increasing <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> services offered online. At the same time, the last few years have seen the deployment in Spain of several online price comparison applications that have significantly increased the price information available to consumers. 3 The empirical analysis is based on price information obtained from the comparison site Soysuper.com. The data cover a period of 182 days—from 1  October 2013 through 31  March 2014 —and include 836, 074 price observations.
