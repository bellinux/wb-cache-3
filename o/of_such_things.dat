5|$|Several {{branches}} of creationism, including creation science, neo-creationism, and intelligent design, {{argue that the}} idea of life being directly designed by a god or intelligence is at least as scientific as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught in public education. Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's evidence, methodology, plausibility, morality, and scientific acceptance. The scientific community does not recognize such objections as valid, pointing to detractors' misinterpretations <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as the scientific method, evidence, and basic physical laws.|$|E
5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic processing of information (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E

25|$|C.S. Lewis, in Mere Christianity and elsewhere, {{raised the}} {{argument}} from desire. He posed that all natural desires {{have a natural}} object. One thirsts, and there exists water to quench this thirst; One hungers, and there exists food to satisfy this hunger. He then argued that the human desire for perfect justice, perfect peace, perfect happiness, and other intangibles strongly implies the existence <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>things,</b> though they seem unobtainable on earth. He further posed that the unquenchable desires of this life strongly imply that we are intended for a different life, necessarily governed by a God who can provide the desired intangibles.|$|E
25|$|The {{methods of}} craft {{transmission}} {{were based on}} those established in China, and consisted of highly methodical copying of sample images until they could be adequately reproduced without looking at the model. This was practiced {{in a number of}} ways, including through use of edehon, “pictorial models containing sketches <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as ideal forms, subjects, and objects that are copied repeatedly for study purposes in learning painting.” This was employed ardently within the Kanō School, which wanted to ensure its tenets were not diluted through its wide network of painters. Consistency was also attempted through written manuals detailing such trade secrets as pigments and brush technique.|$|E
25|$|Matter is {{composed}} <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as atoms, electrons, neutrons, and protons. It has intrinsic or rest mass. In the {{limited range of}} recognized experience {{of the nineteenth century}} it was found that such rest mass is conserved. Einstein's 1905 theory of special relativity showed that it corresponds to an equivalent amount of rest energy. This means that it can be converted to or from equivalent amounts of other (non-material) forms of energy, for example kinetic energy, potential energy, and electromagnetic radiant energy. When this happens, as recognized in twentieth century experience, rest mass is not conserved, unlike the total mass or total energy. All forms of energy contribute to the total mass and total energy.|$|E

25|$|Chibiusa's {{dream is}} to one day become a real lady, to have her own prince, and {{to be friends with}} {{everyone}} she knows. Meanwhile, she is a fairly ordinary little girl; she likes the colour pink and red, pudding, pancakes, and rabbits. Her favorite school subject is drawing, while her least favorites are language classes. Her least favorite food is listed in the manga as carrots, just like Usagi, but they both eat them in the anime. Chibiusa hates taking care of the house and is afraid <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as thunder and lightning, ghosts, vampires, dentists, and needles. She also likes to collect things with rabbits on them, and belongs to the Gardening Committee at school. She is very short when she first appears, but grows slightly taller as she gets older.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Adams {{decided not}} to seek reelection, but rather to {{challenge}} the popular incumbent U.S. Senator John G. Townsend, Jr. for his U.S. Senate seat. A thoughtful moderate Republican, Townsend had supported much of the New Deal legislation, and had demonstrated considerable effectiveness through {{his involvement in the}} establishment <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. By contrast, Adams had a low profile in the House of Representatives and Townsend was able to raise questions about Adams' effectiveness for Delaware. Once again bucking national trends, Delaware had its own local Republican landslide in 1934, led by Townsend. Adams came home and moved to Georgetown, Delaware where he continued the practice of law. He was also the acting Postmaster at Georgetown, from May 6, 1937, until his death.|$|E

Other extensive works were those of the Birmingham Small Arms and Metal Co., at Adderley Park Mills, and the National Arms and Ammunition Co., at Small Heath, and Perry Barr.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{overlap in}} the {{influences}} of the two authors (as could be expected from writers working {{in the same time}} period and location), such as a common interest in thinkers like Augustine of Hippo. However, the primary focus and concern of each writer seems to set them apart. For example, most of the works attributed to Fulgentius the bishop deal with his opposition to heretical factions such as Arianism, a topic for which Fabius Fulgentius seems to have no concern. Topics on which the bishop seemed to have been strongly opinionated (Arianism, free-will, etc.) are never discussed in the mythographer’s work, even when a discussion <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> would seem to fit his discussion. From a linguistic standpoint, the mythographer’s unique style and inclusion of otherwise unused words and idioms is not replicated {{in the work of the}} bishop, which suggests further a negative identification.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Anderson {{appeared}} in a MasterCard television commercial for Super Bowl XL. In it, he manages to cut the ropes binding him to a chair using a pine tree air freshener, uses an ordinary tube sock as the pulley for a zip-line, and somehow repairs and hot-wires a nonfunctional truck using a paper clip, ballpoint pen, rubber band, tweezers, nasal spray, and a turkey baster. In contrast to previous MasterCard commercials showing people making extravagant purchases to accomplish some mundane task, MacGyver is portrayed as escaping from some sort of deathtrap using less than $20 worth of common household items. The commercial ends by showing him purposefully buying an assortment <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> at a department store with his credit card (as a tongue-in-cheek explanation for how he seems to always have items he needs on hand no matter where he goes). Although the commercial implies that Anderson is portraying MacGyver, he is not identified.|$|E

500|$|Italian {{contributions}} to ballet are less known and appreciated {{than in other}} areas of classical music. Italy, particularly Milan, was the European center of court choreography as early as the 15th century in the form <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as ritual masked balls. Early choreographers and composers of ballet include Fabritio Caroso and Cesare Negri. The style of ballet known as the [...] "spectacles all’italiana" [...] imported to France from Italy caught on, and the first ballet performed in France (1581), Ballet comique de la Royn, was composed by an Italian, Baltazarini di Belgioioso, better known by the French version of his name, Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx. Early ballet was accompanied by considerable instrumentation, with the playing of horns, trombones, kettle drums, dulcimers, bagpipes, etc. Although the music has not survived, there is speculation that dancers, themselves, may have played instruments onstage. Then, {{in the wake of the}} French Revolution, Italy again became a center of ballet, largely through the efforts of Salvatore Viganò, a choreographer who worked with some of the most prominent composers of the day. He was made the balletmaster of La Scala in 1812. The best-known example of Italian ballet from the 19th century is probably Excelsior, with music by Romualdo Marenco and choreography by Luigi Manzotti. It was composed in 1881 and is a lavish tribute to the scientific and industrial progress of the 19th century. It is still performed and was staged as recently as 2002.|$|E
500|$|Lennon's first son, Julian, {{was born}} during his {{marriage}} to Cynthia as his commitments with the Beatles intensified {{at the height of}} Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, [...] "I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'" [...] Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, [...] "It's not an acid song." [...] McCartney corroborated Lennon's explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name. Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, [...] "Hey Jules", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song [...] "Hey Jude". Lennon later said, [...] "That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't." ...|$|E
