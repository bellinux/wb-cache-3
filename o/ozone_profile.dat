40|$|Climatological <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> {{data are}} widely used as a-priori {{information}} for total ozone using DOAS type retrievals {{as well as for}} <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> retrieval using optimal estimation, for data assimilation or evaluation of 3 -D chemistry-transport models {{and a lot of other}} applications in atmospheric sciences and remote sensing. For most applications it is important that the climatology represents not only long term mean values but also the links between ozone and dynamic input parameters. These dynamic input parameters should be easily accessible from auxiliary datasets or easily measureable, and obviously should have a high correlation with ozone. For <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> these parameters are mainly total ozone column and temperature profile data. This was the outcome of a user consultation carried out in the framework of developing a new, dynamic <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> climatology. The new <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> climatology is based on the Neural Network Ozone Retrieval System (NNORSY) widely used for <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> retrieval from UV and IR satellite sounder data. NNORSY allows implicit modelling of any non-linear correspondence between input parameters (predictors) and <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> target vector. This paper presents the approach, setup and validation of a new family of <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> climatologies with static as well as dynamic input parameters (total ozone and temperature profile). The neural network training relies on <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> measurement data of well known quality provided by ground based (ozonesondes) and satellite based (SAGE II, HALOE, and POAM-III) measurements over the years 1995 – 2007. In total, four different combinations (modes) for input parameters (date, geolocation, total ozone column and temperature profile) are available. The geophysical validation spans from pole to pole using independent ozonesonde, lidar and satellite data (ACE-FTS, AURA-MLS) for individual and time series comparisons as well as for analysing the vertical and meridian structure of different modes of the NNORSY <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> climatology.

40|$|The Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument 2 (GOME- 2) {{on board}} EPS/MetOp-A {{is the first}} {{instrument}} on a European operational meteorological platform aimed at sensing ozone and other trace gases in the Earth's atmosphere. GOME- 2 is a nadir looking scanning instrument that measures UV-VIS back scattered solar light with a relatively high spectral resolution (0. 2 - 0. 4 nm). From these measurements, a vertical profile of ozone concentrations can be retrieved using the decreasing ozone absorption cross section with wavelength between 270 and 340 nm. Within {{the framework of the}} O 3 MSAF, KNMI has developed the <b>Ozone</b> <b>Profile</b> Retrieval Algorithm (OPERA). OPERA will be used to calculate a vertical <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> for each 640 x 40 km ground pixel on a global scale and in near real time (NRT).

The SASBE <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> is obtained using the radiosonde <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> as a priori information in an optimal estimation retrieval of the SOMORA radiometer. The resulting <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> ranges from ground up to 65 km altitude and makes optimal use of the available information at each altitude. The high vertical resolution of the radiosonde profile can be conserved and {{the uncertainty of the}} SASBE is well defined at each altitude. A SASBE <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> dataset has been generated for Payerne, Switzerland, with a temporal resolution of 3 profiles a week for the time period ranging from 2011 to 2013. The relative difference of the SASBE ozone profiles to the AURA/MLS ozone profiles lies between − 3 to 6 % over the vertical range of 20 – 65 km. Above 20 km, the agreement between the SASBE and AURA/MLS ozone profiles is better than the agreement between the operational SOMORA ozone data set and AURA/MLS. Below 20 km the SASBE ozone data are identical to the radiosonde measurements. The same method has been applied to ECWMF-ERA interim ozone profiles and SOMORA data to generate a SASBE dataset with a time resolution of 4 profiles per day. These SASBE ozone profiles agree between − 4 and + 8 % with AURA/MLS. The improved agreement of the SASBE datasets with AURA/MLS above 20 km demonstrates the benefit of better a priori information in the retrieval of ozone from brightness temperature data...|$|E

40|$|We have {{assessed}} {{the sensitivity of}} the operational OMI <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> retrieval (OMO 3 PR) algorithm to a number of a priori assumptions. We studied the effect of stray light correction, surface albedo assumptions and a priori ozone profiles on the retrieved <b>ozone</b> <b>profile.</b> Then, we studied how to modify the algorithm to improve the retrieval of tropospheric ozone. We found that stray light corrections {{have a significant effect on}} the retrieved <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> but mainly at high altitudes. Surface albedo assumptions, on the other hand, have the largest impact at the lowest layers. Selection of an <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> climatology which is used as a priori information has small effects on the retrievals at all altitudes. However, the usage of climatological a priori covariance matrix has a significant effect. Based on these sensitivity tests, we made several modifications to the OMO 3 PR algorithm: the a priori ozone climatology was replaced with a new climatology (TpO 3), the a priori covariance matrix was calculated from the climatological ozone variance values, and the surface albedo was assumed to be linearly dependent on wavelength in the UV 2 channel. We found that the a priori covariance matrix basically defines the vertical distribution of degrees of freedom for a retrieval. Moreover, all the studied versions of the OMO 3 PR algorithm were equally effective in reducing uncertainty in the retrieved <b>ozone</b> <b>profile.</b> This implies that the posterior error values depend mostly on the assumed a priori errors.

The advantage of using these combined wavelengths and instruments for sounding ozone over either instrument alone is improved sensitivity near the surface {{as well as the}} capability to consistently resolve the lower troposphere, upper troposphere, and lower stratosphere for scenes with varying geophysical states. For example, the vertical resolution for ozone estimates from either TES or OMI vary strongly by surface albedo and temperature and typically provide 1. 6 degrees-of-freedom for signal (DOFS) for TES or less than 1 DOFS for OMI in the troposphere. The combination typically provides 2 degrees-of-freedom for signal (DOFS) in the troposphere with approximately 0. 4 DOFS for near surface ozone (surface to 700 hPa). We evaluate these new <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> estimates with ozonesonde measurements and find that calculated errors for the joint TES and OMI <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> estimates are in approximate agreement with actual errors as derived by the root-mean-square difference between the ozonesondes and the joint TES/OMI ozone estimates.

Umkehr <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> (quarter of Umkehr layer) from 1978 to 2011 are investigated at two locations: Boulder (USA) and Arosa (Switzerland). The study consists of two statistical stages. First we approximate <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> employing an appropriate basis. To capture primary modes of ozone variations without losing essential information, a functional principal component analysis is performed. It penalizes roughness of the function and smooths excessive variations {{in the shape of the}} <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles.</b> As a result, data-driven basis functions (empirical basis functions) are obtained. The coefficients (principal component scores) corresponding to the empirical basis functions represent dominant temporal evolution in the shape of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles.</b> We use those time series coefficients in the second statistical step to reveal the important sources of the patterns and variations in the profiles. We estimate the effects of covariates – month, year (trend), quasi-biennial oscillation, the solar cycle, the Arctic oscillation, the El Niño/Southern Oscillation cycle and the Eliassen–Palm flux – on the principal component scores of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> using additive mixed effects models. The effects are represented as smooth functions and the smooth functions are estimated by penalized regression splines. We also impose a heteroscedastic error structure that reflects the observed seasonality in the errors. The more complex error structure enables us to provide more accurate estimates of influences and trends, together with enhanced uncertainty quantification. Also, we are able to capture fine variations in the time evolution of the profiles, such as the semi-annual oscillation. We conclude by showing the trends by altitude over Boulder and Arosa, as well as for total column ozone.

40|$|Identifying <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> shapes from nadir-viewing {{satellite}} sensors is {{a critical}} yet challenging task for accurate reconstruction of vertical distributions of ozone relevant to climate change and air quality. Motivated {{by the need to}} develop a methodology to fast, reliably, and efficiently exploit ozone distributions and inspired by the success of machine learning, this paper introduces a novel algorithm for estimating <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> shapes from satellite ultraviolet absorption spectra. The Full-Physics Inverse Learning Machine (FP-ILM) algorithm successfully characterizes <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> shapes using machine learning approaches. Its implementation mainly consists of a clustering process based on a semi-supervised agglomerative algorithm, a classification process based on full-physics radiative transfer simulations and a neural network (NN), and a profile scaling process based on a NN ensemble. The classification model has been trained with synthetic data generated by a forward model in conjunction with “smart sampling,” while the scaling model corresponding to each cluster requires total ozone information. The main innovation of FP-ILM is that, unlike conventional inversion methods, the <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> retrieval is formulated as a classification problem, leading to a noteworthy speed-up and accuracy when dealing with applications of satellite data. An outstanding retrieval performance with errors of less than 10 % over 100 – 1 hPa has been obtained for synthetic measurements.

An important focus of the new algorithm is to estimate various sources of errors in the SBUV <b>profiles</b> and total <b>ozone</b> retrievals. We discuss here the smoothing errors that describe the components of the profile variability that the SBUV observing system can not measure. The SBUV(/ 2) instruments have a vertical resolution of 5 km in the middle stratosphere, decreasing to 8 to 10 km below the ozone peak and above 0. 5 hPa. To estimate the smoothing effect of the SBUV algorithm, the actual statistics of the fine vertical structure of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> must be known. The covariance matrix of the ensemble of measured <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> with the high vertical resolution would be a formal representation of the actual ozone variability. We merged the MLS (version 3) and sonde <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> to calculate the covariance matrix, which in general case, for single profile retrieval, might be a function of the latitude and month. Using the averaging kernels of the SBUV(/ 2) measurements and calculated total covariance matrix one can estimate the smoothing errors for the SBUV <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles.</b> A method to estimate the smoothing effect of the SBUV algorithm is described and the covariance matrixes and averaging kernels are provided along with the SBUV(/ 2) <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles.</b> The magnitude of the smoothing error varies with altitude, latitude, season and solar zenith angle.

In the stratosphere above 40 hPa the smoothing errors are less than 5 % and between 10 and 1 hPa the smoothing errors are on the order of 1 %.

Ground-based networks play a pivotal role in evaluating which satellite records comply with end-user requirements and are fit for their purpose. They provide high-quality, independent measurements on a pseudo- global scale from the ground up to the stratosphere. Here, we present an assessment of the long-term stability and mutual consistency of fourteen limb/occultation <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> data records, using NDACC/GAW/SHADOZ ozonesonde and NDACC lidar network data as reference standards. We show how a harmonized analysis framework and robust statistical methods allow us to derive reliable estimates of the drift, bias, and short-term variability of each satellite data record. We examine the dependence of these parameters on altitude and, whenever feasible, on latitude and season. The analysis is furthermore performed in four different <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> representations, as it turns out that auxiliary data used for unit and representation conversions can impact data quality. We discuss the mutual consistency and compliance of satellite data sets with respect to specific user requirements from GCOS and from climate research groups. We conclude by reflecting on the implication of our results for trend assessments on recently merged <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> records (Ozone_CCI, GOZCARDS, SWOOSH, [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of volcanic aerosols on stratospheric ozone {{is a topic}} of current interest, especially with the June 15, 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines. Lidar {{has been used in}} the past to provide aerosol profiles which could be compared with <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> measured using ozonesondes to look for coincidences between volcanic aerosols and ozone decreases. The differential absorption lidar (DIAL) technique has the advantages of being able to measure <b>ozone</b> and aerosol <b>profiles</b> simultaneously as well as being able to cover large geographical regions rapidly. While there are problems associated with correcting the <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> for the presence of aerosols, the corrections can be made reliably when the wavelengths are closely spaced and the Bernoulli method is applied. The DIAL measurements considered in this paper are those obtained in the tropical stratosphere in January 1992 during the Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition (AASE-II). The determination of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> in the presence of Pinatubo aerosols is discussed in a companion paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} the smoothness of vertical <b>profiles</b> of <b>ozone</b> concentrations. We describe the smooth-ness of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> via a characteristic {{scale of the}} profile fluctuations. The characteristic scale was computed for 11 -years (1989 – 1999) ozone sonde data at Sodankylä. Mean values of the characteristic scale were determined. They are ∼ 1 km in the troposphere and ∼ 1. 4 km in the lower stratosphere (up to 25 km). Only slight seasonal variations of these parameters are observed. The information about smoothness of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> is needed both in the instrumental design for defining the vertical resolution requirements and {{in the development of}} inversion algorithms from remote sensing measurements, in order to obtain the best accuracy in retrieved <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> and sufficient resolution.

40|$|Total ozone {{operational}} algorithms use climatological mean <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles.</b> When {{the actual}} <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> have significantly different shapes versus the climatology and the solar zenith angles are large, retrieved total ozone {{will have an}} error. Recalibrated SBUV profiles are used to estimate this error. Preliminary results suggest that, on the average, the change and variation in significant profiles shapes can {{to a large degree}} be estimated by the SBUV derived profiles. Preliminary results suggest the average error in the report algorithm ozone trend (trend in reported <b>ozone)</b> from <b>profile</b> shape is relatively small during the north hemisphere winter (less than 2 percent) for solar zenith angles less than 82 degrees (for 60 degrees North Latitude) ...|$|R
