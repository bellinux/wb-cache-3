From August 1872 to December 1873, Wilhelm had lived among the Chippewa Indians in Wisconsin, where he fathered a daughter. On returning to Denmark, he suffered from syphilis which resulted in bouts of deep depression. After conceiving a child out of wedlock with his maid Anna Rasmussen, he was devastated by breaking his promise to his mother-in-law to remain faithful to his wife. He hanged himself on 28 March 1895 when Karen was almost ten.|$|E

30|$|It {{was found}} that the <b>outdoor</b> service <b>life</b> {{differed}} by 10 – 13 times among the fifteen sites chosen in this study. Focusing on PB(PF), the MOR will reduce by half in around one year at humid sites such as Singapore and Miami, whereas, the same reduction will take ten years at dry sites such as Santiago. Also, the results indicate that PB(MDI) was about 6 times more durable than PB(PF), this again implies that the mechanical durability of particleboards depends on manufacturing conditions such as types of adhesive and amounts of additive used.|$|R

25|$|The {{surgical}} procedure is simple {{both for the}} surgeon, involving very few risks for the experienced ear surgeon. For the patient, minimal discomfort and pain is reported. Patients may experience numbness of {{the area around the}} implant as small superficial nerves in the skin are sectioned during the procedure. This often disappears after some time. There is no risk of further hearing loss due to the surgery. One important feature of the Baha is that, if a patient for whatever reason does not want to continue with the arrangement, it takes the surgeon less than a minute to remove it. The Baha does not restrict the wearer from any activities such as <b>outdoor</b> <b>life,</b> sporting activities etc.|$|E
25|$|One {{of seven}} sons born in Grahamstown to Henry Carter Galpin, watchmaker and jeweller, and Georgina Maria Luck, Ernest Galpin started his {{education}} at the local St. Andrew's College. Due to his father's ill-health, Ernest left school at 14 {{to assist with the}} business. A short spell of active service on the frontier followed, after which he joined the Oriental Banking Corporation, later the Bank of Africa. After being transferred to Middelburg in the Cape, he developed an interest in the local plants and spent long hours dissecting and identifying wild flowers with the aid of the three volumes of Flora Capensis and Harvey's Genera. However, it was not till 1888 when he became bank manager in Grahamstown, that his collecting took on a serious turn. In 1889 he was transferred to Barberton and became intrigued by the relatively unknown local flora. His specimens now started reflecting his meticulous nature in that they were carefully pressed, preserved and labelled with extensive notes on locality, habitat and plant form. His duplicates soon found their way to Kew, Zurich and a number of notable botanists such as Harry Bolus, John Medley Wood and Peter MacOwan. Not surprisingly his collection became internationally known. In Barberton he befriended a young lawyer and plant collector Douglas Gilfillan, later to become his brother-in-law through their marriage to the de Jongh sisters. Galpin had had some new plant discoveries painted by Marie Elizabeth de Jongh (the daughter of Countess Mimi von Schönnberg) and married her in 1892. She shared his love of the <b>outdoor</b> <b>life</b> and accompanied him on many of his excursions and expeditions.|$|E

In 1845, Phoebe's father, a Cincinnati merchant, gave his daughter $1,000, enough to buy the family a farm.

All had experience of <b>outdoor</b> <b>life</b> in extreme conditions, and were experienced skiers.

30|$|In this study, {{we chose}} to use two types of {{particleboard}} with different water resistances as samples among several wood-based panels tested in the project.

Furthermore, three conventional climate indexes relevant to the durability of wood were investigated for their significance to WI. Finally, we predict the <b>outdoor</b> service <b>life</b> of the particleboards for several sites worldwide.|$|R

In its application, Vista Outdoor said it would invest about $10 million in a new facility where about 90 highly-paid employees would work.
