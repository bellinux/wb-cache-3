40|$|The {{effect of}} aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) {{ingestion}} on <b>occult</b> gastrointestinal <b>blood</b> loss {{has been studied}} in patients with treated Addisonian pernicious anaemia and proved achlorhydria and in control patients able to secrete hydrochloric acid. A highly significant increase in gastrointestinal blood loss (1 · 9 ml. /day of treatment) occurred with aspirin ingestion in the achlorhydric patients. The control group had a significantly greater increase in blood loss (4 · 29 ml. /day of treatment). Thus aspirin can produce <b>occult</b> gastrointestinal <b>blood</b> loss by a mechanism unrelated to hydrochloric acid. Half of the control patients had losses of similar magnitude {{to those in the}} pernicious anaemia group, and the degree of blood loss in individual control patients appeared unrelated to gastric acidity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) therapy {{refers to}} the {{transcutaneous}} administration of CO(2) for therapeutic purposes. This effect has been explained {{by an increase in}} the pressure of O(2) in tissues known as the Bohr effect. However, there have been no reports investigating the oxygen dissociation of haemoglobin (Hb) during transcutaneous application of CO(2) in vivo. In this study, we investigate whether the Bohr effect is caused by transcutaneous application of CO 2 in human living body. METHODS: We used a novel system for transcutaneous application of CO(2) using pure CO(2) gas, hydrogel, and a plastic adaptor. The validity of the CO(2) hydrogel was confirmed in vitro using a measuring device for transcutaneous CO(2) absorption using rat skin. Next, we measured the pH change in the human triceps surae muscle during transcutaneous application of CO(2) using phosphorus- 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31) P-MRS) in vivo. In addition, oxy- and deoxy-Hb concentrations were measured with near-infrared spectroscopy in the human arm with <b>occulted</b> <b>blood</b> flow to investigate O 2 dissociation from Hb caused by transcutaneous application of CO(2). RESULTS: The rat skin experiment showed that CO(2) hydrogel enhanced CO(2) gas permeation through the rat skin. The intracellular pH of the triceps surae muscle decreased significantly 10 min. after transcutaneous application of CO(2). The NIRS data show the oxy-Hb concentration decreased significantly 4 min. after CO(2) application, and deoxy-Hb concentration increased significantly 2 min. after CO(2) application in the CO(2) -applied group compared to the control group. Oxy-Hb concentration significantly decreased while deoxy-Hb concentration significantly increased after transcutaneous CO(2) application. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel transcutaneous CO(2) application facilitated an O(2) dissociation from Hb in the human body, thus providing evidence of the Bohr effect in vivo...|$|R

Malignant pleural mesothelioma generally manifests as a locally invasive chest tumor, while cases of gastrointestinal metastases are rare, probably because diagno-sis is difficult. Abdominal symptoms tend to be unspecific and are often interpreted as side effects of chemotherapy, and the sensi-tivity of ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) techniques for detecting intestinal tumors is poor. PET/CT and the com-bination of capsule endoscopy and double-balloon enteroscopy may overcome difficulties in detecting this type of metastatic implant.

Patients & methods: The study covered 18 chronic renal failure patients (CRF) [12 males (66. 7 %) their age ranged from 28 to 65 years and 6 females (33. 3 %) their age ranged from 15 to 55 years] undergoing hemodialysis in Nile Hospital as part of their therapy have to receive blood transfusions (275 blood units) for the first time. Commercial ELISA kits for anti-HCV and nested-RT-PCR (N-RT-PCR) kits were used. Results: Anti-HCV was positive in one serum from the eighteen (5. 5 %) poly transfused CRF patients {{at the end of the}} study while the seventeen sera were negative. This serum was also positive for HCV RNA by N-RT-PCR. Out of the 20 transfused blood units, one blood unit (three components) were tested by blood banking anti-HCV negative by ELISA, were positive for HCV RNA by N-RT-PCR.

40|$|Background: The {{presence}} of visible blood in stool or emesis is frightening {{to the child}} family, and at times, even to the physician. While usually patients with obvious gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding will quickly seek medical attention, those with <b>occult</b> intestinal <b>blood</b> loss are problematic. Iron deficiency anemia or guaiac positive stools {{may be the only}} evidence of intestinal bleeding. Therefore, a diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the child with suspected intestinal blood loss is critical to avoid a delay in diagnosis for the seriously ill child. Methods: In a period of 2 years (march 2001 - march 2003), we studied children with lower GI bleeding hospitalized in the Children’s Hospital, Tabriz or seen in the outpatient clinic. Data on age, sex, chief complaint, endoscopic and colonoscopic results were recorded and statistically analyzed. Findings: There were 59 patients consisting of 20 (33. 9 %) females and 39 (66. 1 %) males. Children in preschool age formed with 31 (52. 5 %) cases the prevalent group. Fourty-nine (83. 1 %) cases presented with a complained of hematochesia and 10 cases (16. 9 %) had melena. Endoscopy was done in 46 patients (78 %) and biopsy was obtained in 45 cases(97. 8 %). Polyp was the most common etiology(32. 2 %). Conclusion: According to this study the majority of patients with lower GI bleeding had hematochesia as chief complaint. Colonoscopy is the best diagnostic method for determining the source of bleeding and provision of appropriate patient care is crucial in these patients [...] The incidence of lesions varies depending on the age of the patient...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A 59 -year-old {{woman with}} a history of nodular goiter {{developed}} thyrotoxic symptoms while on levothyroxine therapy. Her thyrotoxicosis persisted after levothyroxine withdrawal, so she was given methimazole and, once euthyroid, underwent near-total thyroidectomy. Histological examination revealed a nodular variant of Graves' disease. Proptosis, eyelid swelling and diplopia appeared 2 months after surgery. These symptoms worsened, and the patient was initially given four intravenous pulses of glucocorticoids, which resulted in a transient amelioration of her eye symptoms. After glucocorticoid withdrawal, however, the patient's eye motility worsened and there was a reduction of visual acuity in the left eye. She was then referred to our hospital for further advice and treatment. INVESTIGATIONS: Complete thyroid and ophthalmological evaluation, computerized visual field analysis, CT scan of the orbits, routine blood tests, search for <b>occult</b> fecal <b>blood,</b> blood tests for hepatitis B and C virus markers, measurements of serum non-organ-specific autoantibodies and serum anti-TSH-receptor antibodies, and liver ultrasonography. DIAGNOSIS: Nodular Graves' disease with severe, active Graves' orbitopathy complicated by optic neuropathy. MANAGEMENT: Intravenous glucocorticoid therapy for 3 consecutive days, followed by once-weekly pulses of intravenous glucocorticoids over a 10 -week period, and then by oral prednisone treatment on alternate days for 2 months. During the first 2 weeks of intravenous glucocorticoid therapy the patient received orbital irradiation.

Virus was detected by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a quantitative RNA assay that used substitutional PCR. FIV in tissue sections was assayed by DNA and RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Viral DNA was detected in 67 % and 92 % of fetuses with FIV-A-Pet and FIV-C-Pgmr, re-spectively.
