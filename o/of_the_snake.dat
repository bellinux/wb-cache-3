5|$|The body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snake</b> is subcylindrical, and is {{taller than}} it is wide. It has an upper surface that is {{typically}} a shade of blueish gray, while the belly is yellowish, with wide ventral scales that stretch from a third to {{more than half of}} the width of the body. Black rings of about uniform width are present throughout the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snake,</b> but the rings narrow or are interrupted at the belly. The midbody is covered with 21 to 25 longitudinal rows of imbricate (overlapping) dorsal scales. The tail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snake</b> is paddle-shaped and adapted to swimming.|$|E
5|$|The rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River {{watershed}} {{borders on}} several other major Columbia River tributaries - mostly the Spokane River to the north, but also Clark Fork in Montana {{to the northeast}} and the John Day River to the west. Of these, the Clark Fork (via the Pend Oreille River) and the Spokane join the Columbia above the Snake, while the John Day joins downstream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snake,</b> in the Columbia River Gorge. It is of note that the northeastern divide <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River watershed forms the Idaho-Montana boundary, so the Snake River watershed does not extend into Montana.|$|E
5|$|Rugged {{mountains}} {{divided by}} rolling plains characterize the physiographically diverse watershed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River. The Snake River Plain {{was created by}} a volcanic hotspot which now lies underneath Yellowstone National Park, where the headwaters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River arise. Gigantic glacial-retreat flooding episodes {{that occurred during the}} previous Ice Age carved out many topographical features, including various canyons and ridges along the middle and lower Snake River. Two of these catastrophic flooding events significantly affected the river and its surrounds.|$|E

50|$|Bitis nasicornis is {{considered}} to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most dangerous <b>snakes</b> <b>of</b> Africa. Small doses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snake's</b> primarily hemotoxic venom can be deadly. This is unlike the Gaboon viper, <b>the</b> largest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vipers, which uses a considerably larger amount of venom. Bitis nasicornis has both neurotoxic, as well as hemotoxic venom, as do most other venomous <b>snakes.</b> <b>The</b> hemotoxic venom in rhinoceros vipers is much more dominant. This venom attacks <b>the</b> circulatory system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snake's</b> victim, destroying tissue and blood vessels. Internal bleeding also occurs. When not in use, the rhino viper's fangs are folded up into <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snake's</b> mouth. <b>The</b> <b>snake</b> has <b>the</b> ability to control <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> its fangs. Simply because the rhino viper may open its mouth {{does not mean that the}} fangs will flip down into place. These fangs penetrate deep into the victim and <b>the</b> small doses <b>of</b> venom flow through the hollow fangs into the wound.|$|R

5|$|Another {{example of}} {{differentiation}} of snake scales is a transparent scale called the brille or spectacle which covers the eye <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snake.</b> The brille {{is often referred}} to as a fused eyelid. It is shed as part of the old skin during moulting.|$|E
5|$|Later American explorers {{traveled}} {{throughout the}} Snake River area and up its major tributaries beginning in 1806, just after Lewis and Clark had returned. The first was John Ordway in 1806, who also explored the lower Salmon River. John Colter in 1808 {{was the first}} to sight the upper headwaters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River, including the Jackson Hole area.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the return}} flows do not issue {{directly}} back into the Snake River, but rather feed the Snake River Aquifer underneath the Snake River Plain. Water diverted from the river for irrigation, after absorbing any surface pollutants, re-enters the ground and feeds the aquifer. Although the aquifer has maintained its level, {{it has become increasingly}} laced with contaminants. Water in the aquifer eventually travels to the west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Plain and re-enters the river as springs. Throughout much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Plain and Hells Canyon, excessive sediment is also a recurring problem. In December 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along the Snake River to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40%. Pollutant levels in Hells Canyon upstream of the Salmon River confluence, including that of water temperature, dissolved nutrients, and sediment, are required to meet certain levels.|$|E

5|$|Scholar John Lindow {{comments}} that the episode in Gylfaginning detailing Loki's antics with a goat may have associations with castration and a ritual involving making a goddess laugh.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the ventral scales <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snake</b> is an anal {{plate that}} protects the opening to the cloaca (a shared opening for waste and {{reproductive}} material to pass) on the underside near the tail. This anal scale may be single or divided into a pair. The part of the body beyond the anal scale is considered to be the tail.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{explorer}} David Thompson {{first recorded}} the Native American name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River as Shawpatin {{when he arrived}} at its mouth by boat in 1800.

5|$|The Continental Divide of North America runs diagonally {{through the}} southwestern {{part of the}} park. The divide is a {{topographic}} feature that separates Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean water drainages. About {{one third of the}} park lies {{on the west side of}} the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, the waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Mullan Road was {{constructed}} in 1862 and crossed the Snake River with a ferry crossing at Lyons Ferry until {{the construction of the}} Lower Monumental Dam downstream caused the water level to rise and longer wait times, resulting in the reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Bridge. The current route of SR261 from Washtucna to Ritzville was designated during the creation of the Primary and secondary state highways in 1937 as SSH11E.|$|E
2500|$|The habitat {{requirements}} for <b>the</b> queen <b>snake</b> are very specific, and this snake is never found {{in areas that}} lack clean running streams and watersheds with stony and rocky bottoms. The water temperature must be a minimum <b>of</b> [...] during <b>the</b> <b>snake's</b> active months. This is in a large part due to <b>the</b> <b>snake's</b> dietary requirements. They subsist almost entirely on fresh water crayfish. It preys almost exclusively on newly-molted crayfish, which {{are not able to}} defend themselves effectively with their pincers. One study indicates that crayfish make up over 90% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snake's</b> diet.|$|R
2500|$|In 1932, Frank Buck {{wrote about}} {{a teenage boy}} who was eaten by a pet [...] {{reticulated}} python in the Philippines.

5|$|The name of {{the road}} matches its winding route, but {{actually}} derives from the emblem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> Inn, {{one of the few}} buildings on the high stretch of road. In turn, the pub's name and sign were derived from the serpent on the Cavendish arms of William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire. In the early 21st century, the inn was renamed the Snake Pass Inn, such that the inn now refers to the road that referred to itself.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no simple}} way of {{differentiating}} a venomous snake from a non-venomous one merely by using a scale character. Finding out whether a snake is venomous or not is correctly done by identification of the species of a snake {{with the help of}} experts, or in their absence, close examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snake</b> and using authoritative references on the snakes of the particular geographical region to identify it. Scale patterns help to indicate the species and from the references, it can be verified if the snake species is known to be venomous or not.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, the Nez Perce tribe {{was first}} {{founded in the}} valley of the Clearwater River, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River's {{lowermost}} major tributaries. At its height, there were at least 27 Nez Perce settlements along the Clearwater River and 11 more on the Snake between the mouth of the Clearwater and Imnaha Rivers. There were also villages on the Salmon River, Grande Ronde River, Tucannon River, and the lower Hells Canyon area. The Snake River's annual salmon run, which was estimated at that time to exceed four million in good years, supported the Nez Perce, who lived in permanent, well-defined villages, unlike the nomadic southeastern tribes along the Snake River. The Nez Perce also were involved in trade with the Flathead tribe to the north and other middle Columbia River tribes. However, they were enemies to the Shoshone and the other upstream Snake River tribes.|$|E

5|$|As the Tairona of the Colombian Caribbean coast, the Muisca {{made the}} zoomorphic figurines {{based on the}} fauna with their habitat of the area. Main animals used for their figures were the frog and serpents. The serpents were made in zig-zag shapes with eyes {{on top of the}} head. Many serpentiform objects have the typical forked tongue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snake</b> {{represented}} as well as the fawns clearly added. Some of the snakes have beards, moustaches or even a human head. Researcher Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff theorised in his book Orfebrería y chamanismo in 1988 that the basis for the beards and moustaches may have been the abundant fish present on the Altiplano and essential part of the diet of the Muisca and their ancestors, as evidenced in Aguazuque; Eremophilus mutisii.|$|E
5|$|Beta, Gamma, and Iota Serpentis form a {{distinctive}} triangular shape marking the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snake,</b> with Kappa Serpentis being roughly midway between Gamma and Iota. The brightest {{of the four}} with an apparent magnitude of roughly 3.67, Beta Serpentis is a white main-sequence star roughly 160 parsecs distant. It is likely that a nearby 10th-magnitude star is physically associated with Beta, {{although it is not}} certain. The Mira variable R Serpentis, situated between Beta and Gamma, is {{visible to the naked eye}} at its maximum of 5th-magnitude, but, typical of Mira variables, it can fade to below magnitude 14. Gamma Serpentis itself is an F-type subgiant located only 11 parsecs distant and thus is quite bright, being of magnitude 3.84 ± 0.05. The star is known to show solar-like oscillations.|$|E
5|$|Between 1985 and 2007, only {{an average}} of 18 sockeye salmon {{returned}} to Idaho each year. Serious conservation efforts by wildlife biologists and fish hatcheries have captured the few remaining wild sockeye salmon, collected their sperm and eggs, and in a laboratory, have them spawn. Instead of spawning naturally, these sockeye begin their lives in an incubator in a fishery biologist's laboratory. These baby salmon then are transported by ship, bypassing the dams. (The dams can hurt juvenile baby sockeye salmon with their powerful tides and currents, which suck the baby salmon down.) Another conservation effort that has helped the salmon recover, is the destruction of old, outdated dams, such as the Lewiston Dam on the Clearwater River, a tributary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snake.</b> After destroying the dam, salmon populations noticeably recovered.|$|E
