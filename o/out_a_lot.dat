His other pitches (slurve and change-up) travel in the low eighties. Wildness {{has been a problem}} for Sánchez; he has walked 10% – 15% of major-league batters faced each season. However, he also strikes <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of batters; he struck out two hundred {{for the first time in}} his career in 2010. That year, he led all qualifying MLB starting pitchers in limiting hits per innings pitched (6.61 H/9), and his career swinging-strike percentage is among the best in the majors.|$|E
5|$|The sequel, Xenosaga Episode II, was {{developed}} by a new team with Takahashi overseeing the project so the series could be taken {{in a new direction}} by younger staff members within Monolith Soft. The scenario, written by Norihiko Yonesaka based on the initial draft by Takahashi and Saga, ended up leaving <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the originally planned content. Episode II was released in Japan in June 2004, while it was released in North America in February 2005. The sequel was also published in Europe by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe in October of that year. Both Episode I and Episode II were re-imagined for the Nintendo DS as Xenosaga I & II, released in March 2006. Co-developed by Monolith Soft and Tom Create, the scenario was supervised by Takahashi and included material which needed to be cut from the original releases of the first two Xenosaga games. Xenosaga I & II remains exclusive to Japan.|$|E

In 2007, two desalinization plants were built capable of producing 28 tons of clean water every day. Both of the major South Korean telecommunications companies have installed cellular telephone towers on the islets.|$|E
25|$|Recording Unrest {{was another}} intense experience, and the strongest period of {{collective}} learning since The Bacchae. They only had enough material to fill {{one side of}} the LP, and so were forced to spend {{a good deal of time}} developing the studio composition process that produced side two. The recording session brought <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of tensions in the band, these being reflected in the music, but in the end they were pleased with the result and this reunited the group.|$|E
25|$|In early 1992, prices skyrocketed {{throughout}} Russia, {{and a deep}} {{credit crunch}} shut down many industries and brought about a protracted depression. The reforms devastated the living standards {{of much of the}} population, especially the groups dependent on Soviet-era state subsidies and welfare entitlement programs. Through the 1990s, Russia's GDP fell by 50 percent, vast sectors of the economy were wiped out, inequality and unemployment grew dramatically, while incomes fell. Hyperinflation, caused by the Central Bank of Russia's loose monetary policy, wiped <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of personal savings, and tens of millions of Russians were plunged into poverty.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{planting of}} the garden {{is one of the}} Taj Mahal's remaining mysteries. The contemporary accounts mostly deal just with the architecture and only mention 'various kinds of fruit-bearing trees and rare aromatic herbs' in relation to the garden. Cypress trees are almost certainly to have been planted being popular similes in Persian poetry for the slender elegant stature of the beloved. By the end of the 18th century, Thomas Twining noted orange trees and a large plan of the complex suggests beds of various other fruits such as pineapples, pomegranates, bananas, limes and apples. The British, {{at the end of the}} 19th century thinned <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the increasingly forested trees, replanted the cypresses and laid the gardens to lawns in their own taste.|$|E
25|$|The January 1986 {{overthrow}} of President Tito Okello, an ethnic Acholi, by the National Resistance Army (NRA) of south-west Uganda born Yoweri Museveni marked {{a period of}} intense turmoil. The NRA {{in their efforts to}} liberate the entire country meted <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of atrocities on the people of Acholi. This act spurred some Acholis to resist the medieval acts. The Acholi are sometimes said to have feared the loss of their traditional dominance of the national military; they were also deeply concerned that the NRA would seek retribution for the brutal counterinsurgency, particularly the actions of the army in the Luwero triangle. By August of that year, a full-blown popular insurgency had developed in northern regions that were occupied by the new government forces.|$|E
25|$|All {{processes}} in organisms obey physical laws, the difference from inanimate processes lying in their organisation and their being subject to control by coded information. This {{has led some}} biologists and philosophers (for example, Ernst Mayr and David Hull) {{to return to the}} strictly philosophical reflections of Charles Darwin to resolve some of the problems which confronted them when they tried to employ a philosophy of science derived from classical physics. This latter, positivist approach emphasised a strict determinism (as opposed to high probability) and to the discovery of universally applicable laws, testable in the course of experiment. It was difficult for biology, beyond a basic microbiological level, to live up to these structures. Standard philosophy of science seemed to leave <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of what characterised living organisms - namely, a historical component {{in the form of an}} inherited genotype.|$|E

The Lunas described the creation of Ultra as [...] "organic", admitting they had a plan but saying they [...] "figured <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things as [...] were doing them".

That same look all the time just gets boring for the screen and for the actress to wear, so we spread it <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> We try to have her buttoned-up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute dress, like she doesn't quite get it right. Or she takes that sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats. She makes it her way, which is more quirky. The popular girls {{find a way to make}} it look cool, but Rachel makes it look nerdy. But it's not old-school nerdy with thick glasses and pocket protectors.

500|$|Heading {{into his}} junior year, Anderson was named preseason third-team All-Atlantic 10. He {{became known as}} the entrenched {{starting}} point guard for UMass and was named team captain. He posted a team-high 21 points, 5 rebounds, and 6 assists in his debut vs. St. Francis (NY). Anderson notched a career-high 29 points on December 2, against Vermont, connecting on 7 of his 9 three-point attempts. He was the first Minuteman to accomplish the feat since Monty Mack in March 2001. Anderson also recorded the seventh-most three-pointers in a single game in school history. He said, [...] "When you see a guy hit a couple shots you might want to run a play to get that guy open. So it definitely helps <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> it makes it way easier for me."

500|$|After {{recording}} Astral Weeks, Morrison {{moved with}} his wife to a home on a mountain top in the Catskills near Woodstock, a hamlet in upstate New York with an artistic community. Because of the album's poor sales figures, the singer wanted to produce a third record {{that would be more}} accessible and appealing to listeners: [...] "I make albums primarily to sell them and if I get too far <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people can't relate to it. I had to forget about the artistic thing because it didn't make sense on a practical level. One has to live." [...] He began writing songs for Moondance in July 1969. The musicians who went on to record the album with Morrison were recruited from Woodstock and would continue working with him for several years, including guitarist John Platania, saxophonist Jack Schroer, and keyboardist Jef Labes. The singer left after the Woodstock music festival in August attracted an influx of people to the area.|$|E
500|$|During filming, Gillian Anderson {{was unsure}} how exactly to perform her lines. She noted, [...] "the way the script was {{originally}} read to me, initially {{seemed to me}} as if Scully kind of {{stepped up to the plate}} and played along with the sheriff's humor". She reportedly performed her lines in a [...] "tongue in cheek"-esque way before receiving a call from Carter. He informed her that her lines were not meant to be humorous and that the production staff was having to [...] "edit <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of stuff" [...] in order to make up for this. Several of the scenes in the episode were shot at the places they stood in for. The gas station scene was filmed at a real gas station across from the series' production headquarters. The supermarket shots were filmed in an actual supermarket, Shop Easy in Port Coquitlam, a first for the series, according to art director Greg Loewen. The scenes required the store to be closed before Christmas and be installed with up-right freezers.|$|E
