5|$|According to British filmmaker Tony Rayns the film's {{presentation}} of the vanity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> neglecting his family, is a critique of historic men in feudal Japanese culture.

However, by neglecting his family, Genjurō failed to appreciate he has already been blessed with a good life, and in the process, loses it.|$|E
5|$|According to Williams, it is {{possible}} that after Sveinn defeated Ölvir and Frakökk, Ölvir may have fled to kinsmen of his in the Suðreyjar. Williams suggested that the blood feud between the families may be a reason for Sveinn's military activities in the Hebrides and the Isle of Mann, afterwards; although Sveinn had other interests in the area, since he is stated to have married the window of a Manx king. In the late 19th century, antiquary F.W.L. Thomas speculated that the memory of Ölvir may have been preserved in the Hebrides. Thomas stated that within the mythological history of the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis, the island clan of Macaulays were said to be the descendants <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> named Amhlaebh, {{who was one of the}} twelve sons, or near relations, <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> named Oliver, among whom Lewis was divided. This Oliver was said to have been the eldest son of the Norse king who was given the Isles and Highlands by a son of Kenneth MacAlpin, for his assistance in driving his own brother from Scotland. Thomas speculated that Oliver could represent Ölvir Rósta; meaning that he was the progenitor of the Macaulays.|$|E
