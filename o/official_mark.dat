David Bellion gave Manchester United the lead in just 19 seconds {{but it was not}} until the start of the second half that tempers began to flare. A fracas between Robin van Persie and Kieran Richardson, following a late tackle on Richardson by Van Persie, resulted in clashes from both sets of players, which concluded with both protagonists getting booked by match <b>official</b> <b>Mark</b> Halsey.

500|$|After {{sitting out}} the 1949 season to allow {{time for his}} back to heal from the surgery, Fonville {{returned}} to competition in 1950. The 1950 U-M yearbook, Michiganensian, simultaneously lamented about and praised Fonville's comeback, noting his return to form with a [...] throw in the Michigan A.A.U. meet in January and describing how it would have earned {{second place in the}} 1948 Olympics. However, Fonville was not able to throw at the distances he reached in 1948. After a victory in a meet against Wisconsin, The Wisconsin State Journal said: [...] "Charlie Fonville, the former world recordholder in the shot put, heaved a creditable [...] to win the event. The Negro star, sidelined for 18months, returned to competition three weeks ago to heave more than 55feet." [...] He also won the Big Ten Conference indoor title for the third time. However, the AP noted that Fonville [...] "returned to competition this season after laying out last year and either has lost his terrific snap or is favoring the back." [...] Jim Fuchs of Yale broke Fonville's world record, and the AP reported: [...] "An injured back, perhaps, is all that stands in the way of boosting the world's record for the shot put to 60feet. Michigan's Charlie Fonville, the athlete with the bad back, was the world's best shot putter two years ago and still holds the <b>official</b> <b>mark</b> of [...]" [...] Though Fonville won the 1950 Drake relays, his winning throw of [...] was described as [...] "comparatively puny" [...] compared to the [...] throws of Jim Fuchs that year. In 1952, Michigan track coach (and future athletic director) Don Canham dedicated his book Field Techniques Illustrated to Fonville as follows: [...] "Dedicated to Charlie Fonville a world record holder who accepted disappointment as graciously as he did fame and success." ...|$|E
