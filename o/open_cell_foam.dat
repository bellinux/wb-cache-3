Vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5) {{was chosen}} as a {{sintering}} aid to lower the sintering temperature of the ZnO-TiO 2 system. The effect of V 2 O 5 on the sintering behavior of ZnO-TiO 2 ceramics and cermets was studied {{as a function of}} additive percentage and sintering temperature. Then porous alumina ceramics with different porosity were fabricated by two different methods. For both of two methods, the bulk density, porosity, and microstructure of the obtained alumina ceramics were studied. <b>Open</b> <b>cell</b> <b>foams,</b> as one type of porous materials, are nowadays commercially used in a broad range of applications. A method for the generation of random foam structures, based on Laguerre-Voronoi tessellations of randomly packed spheres with log-normal volume distribution, was proposed.

FPT is now part of GKN. For military use, tanks are qualified to MIL-DTL-27422 (includes crashworthiness requirements) or MIL-DTL-5578 (non-crashworthy).

5000|$|One of the {{benefits}} of hammock camping, however, can also be a significant drawback. A suspended hammock allows for a cooling air flow to surround the camper in hot weather but that also makes it harder to stay warm when temperatures plummet either during the evening or seasonally as a sleeping bag will be compressed under a camper's weight, reducing its ability to trap air and provide insulation. When deciding to commit to hammock camping most [...] "hangers" [...] ditch their sleeping bags for down filled or synthetic quilts. The quilts are divided into two different types, top quilts (TQ) and under quilts (UQ). The UQ is suspended underneath the hammock so the weight of the hanger doesn't compress the baffles thus providing the air pockets for your body to heat and keep you warm. Concurrently the TQ is just a down blanket with some having the option or ability to make a small box for your feet. Essentially, it is just the top half of a sleeping bag. Because a sleeping bags underside is compressed it loses its insulating properties. A TQ cuts the unnecessary material to save weight and fabric. The TQ/UQ sleep system is not only warm but each quilt packs into the size of a grapefruit or smaller depending on temperature rating. Some hammocks have been designed with an extra layer of fabric, or a series of large pockets, on the bottom. Insulating material, such as foam, quilting, aluminum windscreen reflectors, [...] clothes, or even dead leaves and brush from the campsite is stuffed between the bottom layers or inside the bottom pockets to create an insulating buffer between the camper and the cold outside air. While the above solutions, except for the found materials, add weight and bulk to the hammock, some approaches use an ultralight <b>open</b> <b>cell</b> <b>foam</b> with a mylar space blanket to mitigate this increase in weight. Another drawback is that a camping hammock requires two trees close enough to hang it and strong enough to support the sleeper's weight. This can be a limitation depending on what environment a person is camping in and at higher elevations where trees are more sparse. In these situations hammock campers may bring along a light groundsheet and [...] "go to ground" [...] using their hammock as a ground tent.|$|E

This study concerns the characterization and modelling of the core and skins of a recently developed sandwich structure. The core consists out of a flexible <b>open</b> <b>cell</b> <b>foam</b> in combination with a rigid closed cell foam. Due to the flexible properties of the spacer {{and the development of a}} new production process, a 3 D-shaped sandwich panel can be produced.

Compression experiments were performed to determine the stiffness of the core {{as a function of}} density and cell size of the <b>open</b> <b>cell</b> <b>foam</b> constituent. The experimental results were fitted to the power-law model [1] and were independent of the cell size of the <b>open</b> <b>cell</b> <b>foam</b> constituent. Micro-CT imaging was used to determine the skin thickness of the sandwich panels in situ. An automated image processing script analysed the region of interest for multiple black/white threshold values.

Existing {{assumptions about the}} foam characteristics that define the elastic properties were expanded to include contributions of axial and shear deformations in addition to bending and were rewritten {{in terms of the}} axial and bending stiffness ratios of ligaments. Compressive and tensile tests were performed to gain a measure of the elastic properties of the foam as well as the behavior and failure mechanisms in both loading conditions.

Tests on samples with deep sharp notches show that the tensile and compressive strengths are notch-insensitive. Fracture toughness measurements show an R-curve behaviour.

Samples of <b>open</b> <b>cell</b> PU-PE <b>foams</b> with negative Poisson's ratio were manufactured and used in the measurements of sound absorption based on ISO 10 - 534 - 2 Standard.
