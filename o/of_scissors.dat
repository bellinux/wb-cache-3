5|$|Chamberlain {{sought the}} {{abolition}} of the elected Poor Law Boards of Guardians, which administered relief and which in some areas were responsible for rates. Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour, and had defied the Government by distributing relief funds to the able-bodied unemployed. Chamberlain's first step in the direction of abolition was the Rating and Valuation Act 1925, which greatly reduced the number of authorities which administered rates, as well as imposing uniform standards for assessment. Despite policy differences Chamberlain continued to work with Churchill, who showed him the manuscript of a volume of his heavily autobiographical The World Crisis. Churchill confided that he would have wished for two more years to revise the manuscript; Chamberlain wrote to his sisters that he could have done the job in two hours—with a pair <b>of</b> <b>scissors.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{intelligence}} assumes {{control of}} Sandy, {{who has been}} marked {{in the same way}} as Ricky. She stabs Barbra (Victoria Tennant) to death with a pair <b>of</b> <b>scissors,</b> demonstrating superhuman strength while committing the murder, and then mutilates Dean and the remains of Mitch, drinking their blood. The rest of the team seek refuge in the Operations Room as Sandy destroys essential machinery – including the base transmitter – with explosives. When the imbalance in Sandy's mind appears to correct itself, Karl, Sharon and Commander Holly McKay (Jennifer Ashley) attempt to sedate her to spare the unborn children. Sandy's madness returns and Holly and Karl are killed in an accident with heat-sealing apparatus, whereupon Sandy disembowels the corpses.|$|E
5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid putting her good shoes {{in the snow and}} filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair <b>of</b> <b>scissors</b> {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{nonlinear}} coupling <b>of</b> the three <b>scissors</b> modes <b>of</b> an anisotropic Bose-Einstein condensate. We show that {{only when the}} frequency of one <b>of</b> the <b>scissors</b> modes is twice the frequency <b>of</b> another <b>scissors</b> mode, these two modes can be resonantly coupled and a down conversion can occur. We perform the calculation variationally using a gaussian trial wave function. This enables us to obtain simple analytical results that describe the oscillation and resonance behaviour of the two coupled modes. Comment: 12 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

5|$|Spencer {{seeks out}} the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, but finds her with another man. Crushed, Spencer {{returns to his}} room, where the child is crying. He takes a pair <b>of</b> <b>scissors</b> {{and for the first}} time removes the child's swaddling. It is {{revealed}} that the child has no skin; the bandages held its internal organs together, and they spill apart after the rags are cut. The child gasps in pain, and Spencer cuts its organs with the scissors. The wounds gush a thick liquid, covering the child. The power in the room overloads; as the lights flicker on and off the child grows to huge proportions. When the lights burn out completely, the child's head is replaced by the planet. Spencer appears amidst a billowing cloud of eraser shavings. The side of the planet bursts apart, and inside, the Man in the Planet struggles with his levers, which are now emitting sparks. Spencer is embraced warmly by the Lady in the Radiator, as both white light and white noise crescendo.|$|E
5|$|The cat skull {{is unusual}} among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a {{powerful}} and specialized jaw. Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them {{between two of the}} prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death. Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae. The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair {{on each side of the}} mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair <b>of</b> <b>scissors.</b> These are vital in feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication. Although cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar, they are nonetheless subject to occasional tooth loss and infection.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, Admiral Coligny {{was walking}} back to his rooms from the Louvre when a shot rang out from a house and wounded him in the hand and arm. A smoking arquebus was {{discovered}} in a window, but the culprit had made his escape {{from the rear of}} the building on a waiting horse. Coligny was carried to his lodgings at the Hôtel de Béthisy, where the surgeon Ambroise Paré removed a bullet from his elbow and amputated a damaged finger with a pair <b>of</b> <b>scissors.</b> Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker. Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny. Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king.• Frieda, 292. The Duke of Anjou was later reported as saying that he and Catherine had planned the assassination with Anne d'Este, who longed to avenge her husband, Francis, Duke of Guise.• For an overview of historians' various interpretations, see Holt, 83–4. Whatever the truth, the bloodbath that followed was soon beyond the control of Catherine or any other leader.|$|E

5|$|As {{in falls}} one and two, Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out against each other. At one point, Guerrero applied Hijo del Santo's own {{submission}} hold, La de a Caballo (camel clutch), {{on him to}} mock his opponent, but {{was not able to}} make Hijo del Santo submit before Octagón saved his partner. Later in the fall, with the referee distracted, Barr was able to surprise Octagón and execute a kneeling reverse piledriver, a move that would have been an automatic disqualification in Lucha Libre. Moments later, Barr was able to pin Octagón to eliminate him from the match. In Lucha Libre, the piledriver is treated as a very dangerous move, something that was sold during this match by Octagón being taken from the arena on a stretcher during the closing moments of the third fall. Minutes later, Hijo del Santo was actually able to kick out of the Superplex/Frog Splash combo by La Pareja del Terror. At one point, both Hijo del Santo and Guerrero were on the floor, which distracted the referee long enough for Blue Panther to enter the ring and perform a piledriver of his own on Barr in retaliation for what was done to Octagón. The move was not seen by the referee but allowed Hijo del Santo to pin Barr, leaving just Hijo del Santo and Guerrero still in the match. A minute or two later, Hijo del Santo was able to roll up Guerrero for the final pinfall and the victory for his team. Following their loss, both Guerrero and Barr visibly cried in the ring, selling the severeness of the loss as they cut off each other's hair with a pair <b>of</b> <b>scissors.</b> This was followed by an AAA official shaving off the rest of their hair with electric clippers backstage.|$|E
