40|$|Screening of lipolytic strains using Rhodamine-B/olive <b>oil</b> <b>plate</b> {{technique}} {{allowed the}} selection of Aspergillus niger MYA 135. Lipase production in submerged culture containing 2 % olive oil was enhanced by more than 50 % compared to basal cultural conditions. Optimal catalytic conditions for olive oil-induced lipase were pH= 6. 5 and 30 – 35 °C. These values were shifted to the acid region (4. 0 – 6. 5) and 35 – 37 °C when lipase extract was produced under basal conditions. Slight changes of the residual lipase activity against the pH were found. However, preincubation at either 37 or 40 °C caused {{an increase in the}} olive oil-inducible lipolytic activity. On the contrary, lipase residual activity decreases in the 30 – 55 °C range when it was produced in basal medium. Lipolytic extracts were almost not deactivated in presence of 50 % water-miscible organic solvents. However, water-immiscible aliphatic solvents reduced the lipase activity between 20 and 80 %...|$|E

Lipases {{have great importance}} since their wide usage in industry. Lipases are produced by microorganisms (bacteria and fungi), plants and animals. However, microbial lipases, especially from bacteria, more useful than their plant and animal derivatives because of several important properties. The primary goals of this thesis were to isolate and identify a lipase producing bacterium from soil sample from Erciyes mountain in Kayseri by 16 S rRNA sequence analysis, find the sequence of lipase gene by degenerate PCR and inverse PCR and analyze of lipase gene for some important features like active site residues. The other {{purposes of this study}} were determination of lipase production conditions like optimum production time, partial purification and characterization of native lipase enzyme. Purification was performed by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration. Spectrophotometric lipase assay was used for enzyme characterization. As conclusion, a lipase producer bacterium was isolated from soil using rhodamine B-olive <b>oil</b> <b>plate</b> assay and identified as a strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens based on 16 S rRNA sequence homology. Its partial lipase gene was obtained and it was suggested that the lipase belong to group 3 Pseudomonas lipases according to gene and amino acid homology search. Moreover, native lipase partially purified and characterized. The molecular mass of purified lipase was estimated to be approximately 43 kDa by SDS-PAGE.

Contrary to many other enzymes, lipases show {{a wide range of}} substrate specificity and remarkable levels of activity and stability in non-aqueous environments. Therefore, they have a great potential in many industrial applications such as detergent industry, paper and food technology, as biocatalysts for the synthesis of organic intermediates. Lipases can be obtained from animals, plants as well as from natural and recombinant microorganisms in good yields. The aim of this thesis was isolation and identification of a lipolytic fungus and purification and characterization of its lipase enzyme. For this purpose, a lipolytic fungus was isolated from soil sample collected from Kula. Lipase activity of this fungus was detected rapidly by Rhodamin B - olive <b>oil</b> <b>plate</b> assay. The lipolytic fungus was identified by 28 S rRNA gene sequence analysis and determined to be a strain of Rhizopus stolonifer. Because this lypolytic fungus was isolated from soil sample collected from Kula, it was named as R. stolonifer K 45. This fungus showed best growth at 25 °C and did not grow above 35 °C. In {{the second part of the}} study, lipase enzyme of the fungus was partially purified but previously, optimum time and carbon source for lipase production was determined. According to this, optimum lipase production was obtained at 7 th day of growth in the media including only olive oil as carbon source. Glucose when included in the growth media was observed to reduce the amount of lipase. In order to purify fungal lipase, aceton precipitation (30 %) and ultrafiltration methods were used. Lipase activity assay was performed spectrophotometrically. The chain length specificity of this lipase was detected and highest activity was observed towards p-NP laurate. The effect of different temperature and pH values on lipase activity and stability was also determined and optimum temperature and pH were found 45 °C and pH 8, respectively. Furhermore, different organic solvents and metal ions were tested on lipase activity. The lypolytic enzyme was inhibited by n-hexane. However, methanol and DMSO were detected to enhance the lipase activity...|$|E

No {{clearing}} zones with abiotic control samples were found, {{which means that}} the clearance zones resulted from bacteria action and not because of other abiotic factors. Hasanuzzaman et al. (2004) reported that a clearance halo around Pseudomonas aeruginosa colony was observed after 3  days on an agar plate (with salad, olive, lard, and waste oils) and correlated to the presence of extracellular lipase enzyme. Satpute et al. (2008) found emulsified hole in coated <b>plates</b> with crude <b>oil</b> after incubation for 7 – 10  days with Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas. In agreement with previous studies, this study found clearing zones formation after 7  day with different bacteria consortia. Wasta sample which have mixture of B. licheniformis, B. firmus and Bosea thioxidants showed the largest clearing zones diameter in heavy oil. Zones formed after incubation with free cells filtrate, suggest that these types of bacteria produce extracellular compounds that break oil and produce clearing zones. Chandran and Das (2010) concluded that culture supernatant of Trichosporon asahii (yeast) when inoculated with diesel oil, produced clear halo. Rodrigues et al. (2006) correlated higher surface activity of biosurfactant solution with larger diameter produced by Lactococcus lactis. Ting et al.

In this study the isolation of thermophilic bacterial consortia from crude oil contaminated soil samples {{and their ability to}} degrade heavy crude oil were investigated. Thermophilic spore forming bacteria were inoculated with heavy oil in minimal salt media. Maximum growth was observed on 21 st day of incubation at 40  °C. Samples were analyzed for biosurfactant production, where a substantial decrease in surface tension and interfacial tension was not observed. A well-assay was used to check the potential of bacterial consortia for oil-clearing zones on <b>oil</b> agar <b>plate</b> with bacterial cultures and their cell-free filtrates. 16 S rRNA sequencing of 27 isolates from oil contaminated soil showed that isolates belonged to three classes: Alpha-proteobacteria, gamma-proteobacteria and Bacilli.

Gas chromatography analysis of treated oil after 21  days showed that bacterial consortia efficiently degraded heavy crude oil to light hydrocarbons ranging from C 11 –C 27, from initial C 37 + carbon chain of untreated controls.
