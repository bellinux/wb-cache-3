40|$|This paper {{presents}} an architecture which applies document similarity measures to the documentation produced during the phases of software development {{in order to}} generate recommendations of process and people metrics for similar projects. The application makes a judgment of similarity of the Service Provision Offer (SPO) document of a new proposed project to a collection of Project History Documents (PHD), stored in a repository of unstructured texts. The process is carried out in three stages: firstly, clustering of the <b>Offer</b> <b>document</b> with the set of PHDs which are most similar to it; this provides the initial indication of whether similar previous projects exist, and signifies similarity. Secondly, determination of which PHD in the set is most comparable with the <b>Offer</b> <b>document,</b> based on various parameters: project effort, project duration (time), project resources (members/size of team), costs, and sector(s) involved, indicating comparability of projects. The comparable parameters are extracted using the GATE Natural Language Processing architecture. Lastly, a recommendation of metrics for the new project is made, {{which is based on}} the transferability of the metrics of the most similar and comparable PHD extracted, here referred to as recommendation.

40|$|In an {{environment}} where expected litigation costs were relatively low {{and the provision of}} forward-looking accounting information was voluntary (Australia), we show that IPO firms voluntarily providing an earnings forecast within the <b>offer</b> <b>document</b> are significantly more likely to use a high quality auditor, consistent with the signaling role of auditor attestation being at least partially dependent on the extent of voluntary, audited disclosures. Any trade-off between auditor choice with either firm risk or retained ownership is confined to smaller IPOs and/or those using less prestigious underwriters, which are also those where support for the signaling role of auditors (and voluntary disclosure) is evident using a valuation model. Our results highlight the failure of “stylised” signaling models such as [Datar et al. (1991); Hughes (1986) ] to recognize extensive interaction between various mechanisms, resulting in multiple signaling equilibria. 24 page(s...|$|E

The most important of these has been the introduction of the personal computer; other developments include the use of high-capacity optical storage devices, improved telecommunications and the development of facsimile transmission. The implementation and integration of these technologies does not in itself mean that document delivery systems will develop on their own. There are still many problems to be overcome.
