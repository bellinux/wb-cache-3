5|$|Bremner's last cap came against Denmark on 3 September 1975. An {{incident}} in Copenhagen {{after the game}} where several players were ejected from a nightclub for an alleged fight led to a lifetime ban from international football by the Scottish Football Association; four other players, Willie Young, Joe Harper, Pat McCluskey and Arthur Graham also were banned for life (Graham and Harper later had their bans overturned). Bremner maintained his innocence, stating that the incident had been blown <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> by the SFA.|$|E
5|$|By November 1885, Adler had a {{theatrical}} club of his own, the Princes Street Club, No. 3 Princes Street (now Princelet Street, E1), purpose-built, financed by a butcher named David Smith. It seated 300; playing every night except Friday, he was earning about £3 s.10 a week, {{but with a}} fame well <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> to the meagre money. Many {{of the most prominent}} figures in Yiddish theater, including Sigmund Mogulesko, David Kessler, Abba and Clara Shoengold, and Sara Heine (the future Sara Adler), gave guest performances when they passed through London.|$|E

50|$|De-escalation {{refers to}} {{behavior}} that is intended to escape escalations of conflicts. It may also refer to approaches in conflict resolution. Escalations of commitment are often hard from spiraling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportions</b> without specific measures being taken.|$|R
5000|$|The CM took {{social welfare}} {{minister}} Ravela Kishore Babu {{to task for}} allowing the dispute with Guntur district ZP chairperson Shaik Johnymoon to blow <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportions.</b> [...] "It was not an isolated incident.

5|$|Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia (also {{known as}} The Triumph of Cleopatra) is based loosely on Plutarch's Life of Antony and Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, {{in which the}} Queen of Egypt travels to Tarsus in Cilicia aboard a grand ship to cement an {{alliance}} with the Roman general Mark Antony. While superficially similar to The Coral Finder, Cleopatra is {{more closely related to}} the style of Regnault, with its intentionally cramped and crowded composition. The individual figures are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> to each other and the ship, while many figures are tightly positioned within a small section of the painting. As well as from Regnault, the work borrows elements from Titian, Rubens and classical sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Persons with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have no detectable systemic {{symptoms or}} signs (i.e., outside the mouth). Generally, symptoms may include prodromal sensations such as burning, itching, or stinging, which may precede {{the appearance of}} any lesion by some hours; and pain, which is often <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> {{to the extent of}} the ulceration and is worsened by physical contact, especially with certain foods and drinks (e.g., if they are acidic). Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer, and then recedes as healing progresses. If there are lesions on the tongue, speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable, and ulcers on the soft palate, back of the throat, or esophagus can cause painful swallowing. Signs are limited to the lesions themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{large and}} {{damaging}} tsunami that was generated was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> {{relative to the}} size of the event, based on its short-period body wave magnitude. The Indonesian Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency assigned a magnitude of 6.8, and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported a similar value of 6.1 (both body wave magnitude) that were calculated from short-period seismic waves (1–2 seconds in the case of the USGS). The USGS then presented a moment magnitude of 7.2 that was calculated from 5–100-second surface waves, and Harvard University subsequently revealed that a moment magnitude of 7.7 had been resolved based on even longer 150-second surface waves.|$|E

To this, he attributes the Palestinians' taking advantage of UNRWA's largesse, which gives out free food and aid without asking questions and deliberate gross inflation in the number of refugees by Palestinians themselves.|$|R

5|$|While each façade of Quattro Canti is {{pleasing}} to the eye, as a scheme {{it is both}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> with the limited size of the piazza and, like most other examples of early Sicilian Baroque, can be considered provincial, naive and heavy-handed, compared with later developments. Whatever its merit, {{it is evident that}} during the 17th century, the Baroque style {{in the hands of the}} local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised variation on the mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to Sicily, but occurred as far afield as Bavaria, and Russia, where Naryshkin Baroque would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.|$|E

25|$|The {{accelerated}} {{growth in}} different body parts happens at different times, {{but for all}} adolescents it has a fairly regular sequence. The first places to grow are the extremities—the head, hands and feet—followed by the arms and legs, then the torso and shoulders. This non-uniform growth {{is one reason why}} an adolescent body may seem <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion.</b>|$|E

25|$|Because of the three-fifths {{compromise}} in the U.S. Constitution, in which slaves {{counted in the}} calculation of how many representatives a state had in Congress (though only three-fifths {{as much as a}} free person), the planter class had long held power in Congress <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> to the total number of free people in the US population as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Pain is severe, {{frequently}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> {{to physical}} signs, and often requires {{the use of}} opiates to reduce it to tolerable levels. Pain should be treated as early as medically possible. Nausea can be severe; it may respond to phenothiazine drugs but is sometimes intractable. Hot baths and showers may lessen nausea temporarily, though caution should be used to avoid burns or falls.|$|E

25|$|Complex {{regional}} pain syndrome (CRPS), {{also known}} as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), is a long term pain syndrome that often worsens with time. It is characterized by severe pain <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> to the original injury and is often accompanied by sensitivity, swelling, {{and changes in the}} skin. It may initially affect one limb and then spread throughout the body; 35% of affected people report symptoms throughout their whole body.|$|E
