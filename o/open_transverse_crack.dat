Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are used for detecting the location and severity i. e. crack size but these techniques are costly and time consuming. Modal parameters like natural frequency, mode shape {{can be used to}} detect the crack in beams. The present work is aimed for detection of <b>open</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>crack</b> in a Euler Bernoulli beam. The crack considered is an open crack and the analysis is made for linear behaviour of the beam. Finite element method is adopted for the dynamic analysis of the beam. Additional flexibility coefficients of the cracked beam element are computed using 6 -point Gaussian quadrature and theories of fracture mechanics. The total flexibility matrix is obtained by adding the additional flexibility coefficients to the intact element flexibility matrix. Then from the total flexibility matrix, overall flexibility matrix is obtained. Stiffness matrix of the cracked element is derived from the overall flexibility matrix of the element for the analysis of an Euler Bernoulli beam. The first four natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes of vibration are obtained by dynamic analysis solving the Eigen value problem using a FORTRAN code. These natural frequencies are used for the crack detection. 3 D graphs of normalized frequency (cracked beam frequency/intact beam frequency) in terms of crack depth and crack location are plotted.

Crack in vibrating components causes a change in physical properties of a structure which in turn affects dynamic response characteristics.

To investigate specimen configuration effect on width-direction propagation of <b>transverse</b> <b>cracks,</b> coupon specimens with ranges of specimen width and transverse ply thickness are tested. Detailed observations of <b>transverse</b> <b>cracks</b> {{indicate that there}} are consecutive three-stage processes of edge crack initiation, edge crack increase without inward propagation, and crack propagation across the width in quasi-isotropic laminates, whereas simultaneous <b>transverse</b> <b>crack</b> propagation takes place across the width in conjunction with new edge crack formation in cross-ply laminates. The detailed process of <b>transverse</b> <b>cracking</b> is investigated using three-dimensional FEA in order to clarify the difference of damage process between quasi-isotropic and cross-ply laminates.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State UniversityTransverse {{cracking}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} distress types in asphalt pavement. The crack initiates from pavement surface and propagates downward (thermal cracking), or initiates from pavement bottom and propagates upward (reflective cracking). In this study, the mechanism and key factors of a <b>transverse</b> <b>cracking</b> type named Surface-initiated reflective cracking (SIRC) are identified and evaluated. SIRC refers to crack that initiates at the surface of pavement layer in transverse direction and propagates downward to match the existing <b>transverse</b> <b>cracking,</b> and there is no cracking in the interlayer. The mechanism and key factors of the SIRC are evaluated by using three-dimensional Finite Element Method and laboratory modified Hamburg Wheel Tracking Test. Results indicate that when the HMA surface layer is thick, thermal load associated with traffic load, overlay stiffness and thickness above existing crack/joint are the key factors to initiate SIRC. When the pavement thickness is at certain thickness range (i. e., thick enough to protect the existing crack/joint to move but not too thick which can allow the surface layer bending downward with weak base structure), with relative stiff overlay material and weak base, tensile stress can develop at the surface of the pavement layer which can ultimate lead to SIRC under repeated traffic load. The widely used <b>transverse</b> <b>cracking</b> prediction model TCMODEL is evaluated to check its predictive quality on conventional <b>transverse</b> <b>cracking</b> and the SIRC. It is found that the predicted <b>transverse</b> <b>crack</b> from TCMODEL do not match well with the field measurements and therefore, it is necessary to develop new predictive models for <b>transverse</b> <b>cracking</b> including all <b>transverse</b> <b>cracking</b> types.
