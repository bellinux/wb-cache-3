40|$|In the coevolving voter model, each voter {{has one of}} two {{diametrically}} <b>opposite</b> <b>opinions,</b> and a voter encountering {{a neighbor}} with the <b>opposite</b> <b>opinion</b> may either adopt it or rewire the connection to another randomly chosen voter sharing the same opinion. As we smoothly change the relative frequency of rewiring {{compared to that of}} adoption, there occurs a phase transition between an active phase and a frozen phase. By performing extensive Monte Carlo calculations, we show that the phase transition is characterized by critical exponents β= 0. 54 (1) and ν = 1. 5 (1), which differ from the existing mean-field-type prediction. We furthermore extend the model by introducing a contrarian type that tries to have neighbors with the <b>opposite</b> <b>opinion,</b> and show that the critical behavior still belongs to the same universality class irrespective of such contrarians' fraction.

50|$|In moral theology, {{especially}} Catholic, {{it refers}} {{especially to the}} view in casuistry that in difficult matters of conscience one may safely follow a doctrine that is probable, for example is approved by a recognized Doctor of the Church, even if the <b>opposite</b> <b>opinion</b> is more probable.|$|R
5000|$|Starting {{from the}} end of 2002, Allam {{gradually}} assumed virtually <b>opposite</b> <b>opinions</b> on most issues related to Islamic world and Middle-East.

40|$|In {{a recent}} work [Shao et al 2009 Phys. Rev. Lett. 108 018701], a nonconsensus opinion (NCO) model was proposed, where two {{opinions}} can stably coexist by forming clusters of agents holding the same opinion. The NCO model on lattices and several complex networks displays a phase transition behavior, which {{is characterized by}} a large spanning cluster of nodes holding the same opinion appears when the initial fraction of nodes holding this opinion is above a certain critical value. In the NCO model, each agent will convert to its <b>opposite</b> <b>opinion</b> if there are more than half of agents holding the <b>opposite</b> <b>opinion</b> in its neighborhood. In this paper, we generalize the NCO model by assuming that each agent will change its opinion if the fraction of agents holding the <b>opposite</b> <b>opinion</b> in its neighborhood exceeds a threshold T (T≥ 0. 5). We call this generalized model as the NCOT model. We apply the NCOT model on different network structures and study the formation of opinion clusters. We find that the NCOT model on lattices displays a continuous phase transition. For random graphs and scale-free networks, the NCOT model shows a discontinuous phase transition when the threshold is small and the average degree of the network is large, while in other cases the NCOT model displays a continuous phase transition...|$|R
50|$|Probabilism {{is one way}} of {{approaching}} difficult matters of conscience. In such cases, according to probabilism, one may safely follow a doctrine approved by a recognized Doctor of the Church, even if the <b>opposite</b> <b>opinion</b> is more probable as judged by other considerations, such as scientific considerations or many other recognized authoritative opinions.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we examine}} the problem of mining {{antagonistic}} communities from social networks. In social networks, people with <b>opposite</b> <b>opinions</b> normally behave differently and form sub-communities each of which containing people sharing some common behaviors. In one scenario, people with <b>opposite</b> <b>opinions</b> show differences in their views {{on a set of}} items. Another scenario is people explicitly expressing whom they agree with, like or trust as well as whom they disagree with, dislike or distrust. We defined the indirect and direct antagonistic groups based on the two scenarios. We have developed algorithms to mine the two types of antagonistic groups. For indirect antagonistic group mining, our algorithm explores the search space of all the possible antagonistic groups starting from antagonistic groups of size two, followed by searching antagonistic groups of larger sizes. We have als...|$|R

50|$|In Catholic moral theology, probabilism {{provides}} a way of answering the question {{about what to do}} when one does not know what to do. Probabilism proposes that one can follow an authoritative opinion regarding whether an act may be performed morally, even though the <b>opposite</b> <b>opinion</b> is more probable. It was first formulated in 1577 by Bartholomew Medina, OP, who taught at Salamanca.|$|R
50|$|This {{reflected}} {{an ongoing}} debate {{at the time}} among archivists and librarians about {{the relative merits of}} sprinkler systems: Some felt that there was a greater chance for water damage from the activation of one or more sprinkler heads, whether in a fire or accidentally, than the chance of fire damage without sprinklers to suppress it, while others were of the <b>opposite</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|R
