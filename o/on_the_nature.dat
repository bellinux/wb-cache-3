5|$|Ancient India, {{particularly}} the centuries {{in which the}} Mahavira and the Buddha lived, were one of intense intellectual debates, especially <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of reality and self or soul. Jain view of soul differs from those found in ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts, and Jain view about jiva and ajiva (self, matter) utilizes anekantavada.|$|E
5|$|In the book, Hemingway explores {{conflict}} {{within a}} marriage, {{the conflict between}} the European and native cultures in Africa, and the fear a writer feels when his work becomes impossible.

5|$|Romanticism {{began to}} subside as a {{movement}} in the 1830s, but it continued to significantly affect areas such as music until the early twentieth century. It also had a lasting impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of Scottish identity and outside perceptions of Scotland.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of This World {{has a deep}} focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of revolution, and {{the novel}} itself {{can be viewed as}} a {{reflection}} of Carpentier's ideological perspective towards revolutions. Carpentier tries to establish the idea that a distinction must be made between revolutions and reactions. While a revolution produces progress, a reaction does not.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} that {{one type of}} organism could descend from another type goes back {{to some of the}} first pre-Socratic Greek philosophers, such as Anaximander and Empedocles. Such proposals survived into Roman times. The poet and philosopher Lucretius followed Empedocles in his masterwork De rerum natura (<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nature</b> of Things).|$|E

50|$|The first European {{mention of}} the {{directional}} compass is in Alexander Neckam's <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Natures</b> of Things, written in Paris around 1190.

5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the Council are members of a {{political}} party at national level, and most of these are members of a European-level political party. However the Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties and the nature of coalition governments {{in a number of states}} means that individual configurations would vary on which domestic party was assigned the portfolio. However the broad ideological alignment of each state does have a bearing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the law the Council produces and the extent to which the link between domestic parties puts pressure on the members in the European Parliament to vote a certain way.|$|E
5|$|Although Robert {{condemned}} Gilbert Porrée {{in conjunction}} with Peter Lombard, he {{did not agree with}} Lombard's Christology, or views <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of Jesus Christ. Likewise, although he disagreed with some of Abelard's teachings, he defended Abelard against charges of heresy. Robert did, however, agree with some of Abelard's teachings and methods. The introduction to the Sententiae proclaims Robert's desire to harmonise the writings of two unnamed scholars, who have been identified by modern writers as Hugh of St Victor and Abelard.|$|E
5|$|Archimedes' Book of Lemmas or Liber Assumptorum is a {{treatise}} with fifteen propositions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of circles. The earliest known copy of {{the text}} is in Arabic. The scholars T. L. Heath and Marshall Clagett argued that it cannot {{have been written by}} Archimedes in its current form, since it quotes Archimedes, suggesting modification by another author. The Lemmas may be based on an earlier work by Archimedes that is now lost.|$|E

5|$|As {{described}} below, Apollonius' {{problem has}} ten special cases, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> {{of the three}} given objects, which may be a circle (C), line (L) or point (P). By custom, these ten cases are distinguished by three letter codes such as CCP. Viète solved all ten of these cases using only compass and straightedge constructions, and used the solutions of simpler cases to solve the more complex cases.|$|E
5|$|Epicurus (341 – 270 BC) {{anticipated}} {{the idea of}} natural selection. The Roman philosopher and atomist Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BC) explicated these ideas in his poem De rerum natura (<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nature</b> of Things). In the Epicurean system, {{it was assumed that}} many living forms had been spontaneously generated from Gaia in the past, but that only the most functional forms had survived to have offspring. The Epicureans did not anticipate the full theory of evolution as we now know it, but seem to have postulated separate abiogenetic events for each species.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Modern Times, Chaplin left with Goddard {{for a trip to}} the Far East. The couple had refused to comment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of their relationship, and it was not known whether they were married or not. Some time later, Chaplin {{revealed}} that they married in Canton during this trip. By 1938, the couple had drifted apart, as both focused heavily on their work, although Goddard was again his leading lady in his next feature film, The Great Dictator. She eventually divorced Chaplin in Mexico in 1942, citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year.|$|E

5|$|Glycerophospholipids, usually {{referred}} to as phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, {{as well as being}} involved in metabolism and cell signaling. Neural tissue (including the brain) contains relatively high amounts of glycerophospholipids, and alterations in their composition has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Glycerophospholipids may be subdivided into distinct classes, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the polar headgroup at the sn-3 position of the glycerol backbone in eukaryotes and eubacteria, or the sn-1 position in the case of archaebacteria.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp {{showed the}} highest ever linear {{polarization}} detected for any comet. Such polarization {{is the result}} of solar radiation getting scattered by the dust particles in the coma of the comet and depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the grains. It further confirms that the dust grains in the coma of comet Hale–Bopp were smaller than inferred in any other comet.|$|E
5|$|Halley was {{the first}} comet to be {{recognized}} as periodic. Until the Renaissance, the philosophical consensus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere. This idea was disproved in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon. Many were still unconvinced that comets orbited the Sun, and assumed instead that they must follow straight paths through the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Hopping or jumping is conceptually {{the most}} basic {{mechanism}} for diffusion of adatoms. In this model, the adatoms reside on adsorption sites on the surface lattice. Motion occurs through successive jumps to adjacent sites, the number of which depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the surface lattice. Figures 1 and 3 both display adatoms undergoing diffusion via the hopping process. Studies have shown the presence of metastable transition states between adsorption sites wherein {{it may be possible}} for adatoms to temporarily reside.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{like with}} many of the New Trade Theory models, the results of the Brander Spencer model and the policy {{prescriptions}} it generates are very sensitive to the underlying assumptions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the industry in question, the information available to the national government, its ability to credibly commit to an action and the likely response of foreign governments. Some of these criticisms were already noted by Brander and Spencer in their paper, where they advised caution.|$|E
5|$|Iridium is also {{obtained}} commercially as {{a by-product}} from nickel and copper mining and processing. During electrorefining of copper and nickel, noble metals such as silver, gold and the platinum group metals {{as well as}} selenium and tellurium settle {{to the bottom of}} the cell as anode mud, which forms the starting point for their extraction. To separate the metals, they must first be brought into solution. Several separation methods are available depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the mixture; two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia, and dissolution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid.|$|E
