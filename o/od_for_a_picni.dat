40|$|We use the {{photopigment}} template of Baylor et al.

The use of a template allows us to illustrate the general behavior of Rayleigh matches as the absorption spectra of the underlying spectra are altered. In a plot of the Y setting against the red–green ratio (R), both an increase in lmax and an increase in optical density lead to an anticlockwise rotation of the locus of the matches satisfied by a given pigment. Since both these factors affect the match, {{it is not possible to}} reverse the analysis and define uniquely the photopigments corresponding to a specific Rayleigh match. However, a way to constrain the set of candidate photopigments would be to determine the trajectory of the change of match as the effective optical density is altered (by, say, bleaching or field size) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Oral submucous {{fibrosis}} is a scarring {{progressive disease}} characterized by juxta-epithelial inflammatory reaction and progressive fibrosis of the submucosal tissues, i. e., lamina propria and deeper connective tissues. An {{attempt was made}} in this study to evaluate the role of vitamin E {{in the treatment of}} oral submucous fibrosis by carrying out a comparative study between regular intralesional dexamethasone, hyaluronidase, and local anesthesia with and without oral vitamin E capsules. Materials and Methods: Twenty histopathologically confirmed oral submucous fibrosis cases were randomly selected and divided into two groups, with 10 cases in each group. Group A patients were given intralesional dexamethasone 2 ml (2 mg/ml), hyaluronidase (1500 IU), and 0. 2 cc lignocaine (2 %), every week. In addition, group B patients were given oral vit E capsules, 400 IU <b>OD,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> period of 8 weeks. Weekly follow-ups were done. Results: Addition of vitamin E to the conventional treatment had synergistic effect with more improvement in the patient′s condition in terms of burning sensation, vesiculation/ulceration, pigmentation, paleness of oral mucosa, tongue protrusion, and extent of mouth opening, which was confirmed histopathologically.

Gafchromic EBT film {{has been shown to}} produce a scanning orientation effect whereby variations in measured relative optical density are found due to the films orientation relative to the scanner direction. This relative optical density change was found to be relatively consistent for different films exposed to varying dose levels ranging from 0 Gy to 3 Gy. A maximum variation of 0. 0157 ± 0. 0035 in optical density (OD) was found. This relates to an approximate 15 % variation in net <b>OD</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 50 cGy irradiated film and 4 % variation <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 3 Gy irradiated film. No noticeable effects or variations were seen with changing scanning resolution or with the film placed “up or down ” during scanning.

40|$|Abstract. Gossiping is an {{important}} problem in Radio Networks that has been well studied, leading to many important results. Due to strong resouce limitations of sensor nodes, previous solutions are frequently not feasible in Sensor Networks. In this paper, we study the gossiping problem in the restrictive context of Sensor Networks. By exploiting the geometry of sensor node distributions, we present reduced, optimal running time of <b>O(D</b> + ∆) <b>for</b> <b>an</b> algorithm that completes gossiping with high probability in a Sensor Network of unknown topology and adversarial wake-up, where D is the diameter and ∆ the maximum degree of the network. Given that <b>an</b> algorithm <b>for</b> gossiping also solves the broadcast problem, our result proves that the classic lower bound of [16] can be broken if nodes are allowed to do preprocessing. ...|$|R

40|$|A new deprotection {{procedure}} {{enables a}} medium scale preparation of phosphodiester and phosphorothioate oligonucleotides substituted with a protected thiol function at their 5 ′-ends and an amino group at their 3 ′-ends in good yield (up to 72 <b>OD</b> units/µmol <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 19 mer phosphorothioate). Syntheses of 3 ′-amino-substituted oligonucleotides {{were carried out}} on a modified support. A linker containing the thioacetyl moiety was manually coupled in two steps by first adding its phosphoramidite derivative {{in the presence of}} tetrazole followed by either oxidation or sulfurization to afford the bis-derivatized oligonucleotide bound to the support. Deprotection was achieved by treating the fully protected oligonucleotide with a mixture of 2, 2 ′-dithiodipyridine and concentrated aqueous ammonia in the presence of phenol and methanol. This procedure enables (i) cleavage of the oligonucleotide from the support, releasing the oligonucleotide with a free amino group at its 3 ′-end, (ii) deprotection of the phosphate groups and the amino functions of the nucleic bases, as well as (iii)  transformation of the 5 ′-terminal S-acetyl function into a dithiopyridyl group. The bis-derivatized phosphorothioate oligomer was further substituted through a two-step procedure: first, the 3 ′-amino group was reacted with fluorescein isothiocyanate to yield a fluoresceinylated oligonucleotide; the 5 ′-dithiopyridyl group was then quantitatively reduced to give a free thiol group which was then substituted by reaction with an Nα-bromoacetyl derivative of a signal peptide containing a KDEL sequence to afford a fluoresceinylated peptide–oligonucleotide conjugate...|$|R
40|$|The social {{functions}} of urbanized areas are {{highly dependent on}} {{and supported by the}} convenient access to public transportation systems, particularly for the less privileged populations who have restrained auto ownership. To accurately evaluate the public transit accessibility, it is critical to capture the spatiotemporal variation of transit services. This can be achieved by measuring the shortest paths or minimum travel time between origin-destination (OD) pairs at each time-of-day (e. g. every minute). In recent years, General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data has been gaining popularity for between-station travel time estimation due to its interoperability in spatiotemporal analytics. Many software packages, such as ArcGIS, have developed toolbox to enable the travel time estimation with GTFS. They perform reasonably well in calculating travel time between <b>OD</b> pairs <b>for</b> <b>a</b> specific time-of-day (e. g. 8 : 00 AM), yet can become computational inefficient and unpractical with the increase of data dimensions (e. g. all times-of-day and large network).

An open-source toolbox written in C++ is developed to implement the algorithm.
