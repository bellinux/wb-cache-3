Continued good behaviour could see the convict granted a ticket-of-leave, allowing private employment in a specified district of the colony, and eventually a Conditional Pardon, allowing most freedoms, except for returning to England. A Certificate of Freedom would only be granted {{at the end of}} a sentence. Misbehaviour would result in demotion through these levels of work, including returning to convict status within the prison. Re-offenders and captured escapees, after corporal punishment and time in solitary confinement, would be placed on a chain gang undertaking hard labour, typically on roads near Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|Andretti had a {{long career}} in racing. He {{was the only person}} to be named United States Driver of the Year in three decades (1967, 1978, and 1984). He was also one of only three drivers to have won major races <b>on</b> <b>road</b> courses, paved ovals, and dirt tracks in one season, a feat that he {{accomplished}} four times. With his final IndyCar win in April 1993, Andretti became the first driver to have won IndyCar races in four different decades and the first to win automobile races of any kind in five.|$|E

5|$|Banksia cuneata was {{declared}} critically endangered after a 1982 survey found only five populations comprising about 450 plants. The largest population, consisting of around 300 plants, {{was on a}} conservation reserve, but all others were <b>on</b> <b>road</b> verges, and contained only 50–70 plants each. However, since then more plants have been located, and populations {{have been found to}} be gradually increasing in response to a number of conservation measures including fencing and baiting of rabbits. In recognition of its slight recovery, it is now considered endangered but no longer critically so.|$|E
5|$|Bovista pila, {{commonly}} known as the tumbling puffball, is a species of puffball fungus in the family Agaricaceae. A temperate species, it is widely distributed in North America, where it grows on the ground <b>on</b> <b>road</b> sides, in pastures, grassy areas, and open woods. There are few well-documented occurrences of B.pila outside North America. B.pila closely resembles the European B.nigrescens, from which it can be reliably distinguished only by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Brown sat {{his players}} down in {{classrooms}} and relentlessly tested {{them on their}} knowledge of the playbook, requiring them to copy down every play in a separate notebook for better retention. He was a terse man, and his criticisms of players were often withering and ruthless. He prohibited players from drinking, told them not to smoke in public and made coats and ties mandatory <b>on</b> <b>road</b> trips. They were not to have sex after Tuesday night during the season.|$|E

50|$|By 1916, {{a series}} of unpaved state roads was laid out from Texola, {{just east of the}} Texas state line, east via Erick to Delhi, north to Sayre, and east and north via Doxey to Elk City. It became part of Route 66 in 1926; this initial {{alignment}} ran along the state line from a bit south of the old railroad grade south to E1240 Road, and then ran east through Texola on Fifth Street. After a mile south <b>on</b> N1680 <b>Road,</b> it turned east <b>on</b> E1250 <b>Road</b> to Erick, then south again <b>on</b> N1750 <b>Road,</b> east <b>on</b> E1260 <b>Road,</b> south <b>on</b> N1810 <b>Road,</b> and east <b>on</b> E1270 <b>Road</b> to Delhi. Traffic turned north at N1870 Road (now US-283), jogging west <b>on</b> E1250 <b>Road</b> at the mismatch in the section lines, and entered Sayre <b>on</b> N1870 <b>Road.</b> The bridge over the North Fork of the Red River in Sayre was built of timber in 1924 and upgraded and widened with steel in 1933. It was bypassed in 1958, and has been demolished; its remains are on private property. The original Route 66 passed through Sayre on Main Street (now SH-152) and Fourth Street, leaving to the east on Benton Boulevard (E1180 Road). It then turned north <b>on</b> N1900 <b>Road,</b> east <b>on</b> E1170 <b>Road</b> (there was a cutoff on the southeast side of the railroad at this turn), north <b>on</b> N1960 <b>Road,</b> east <b>on</b> E1160 <b>Road,</b> and north <b>on</b> N2000 <b>Road</b> into Elk City on Randall Avenue.

Ford reportedly threatened to quit the team {{in response to the}} university's decision, but eventually agreed to play against Georgia Tech when Ward personally asked him to play.|$|E
5|$|In the 2016 Paris–Nice, three jerseys were awarded. The general {{classification}} {{was calculated}} by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers <b>on</b> <b>road</b> stages (Stages 1–7): the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for {{the second and third}} riders respectively. Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints (three seconds for the winner of the sprint, two seconds for the rider in second and one second for the rider in third). The leader of the general classification received a yellow jersey.|$|E
5|$|One {{suggested}} {{route for}} an O-Bahn was for an alignment {{adjacent to the}} Noarlunga Centre railway line from {{the city to the}} Tonsley railway line. The O-Bahn would end there, with buses continuing on the Southern Expressway through the far south. Construction of this O-Bahn would require moving the railway track slightly to fit the O-Bahn alongside. In addition, Emerson Crossing and the Goodwood tram overpass would require alteration. The estimated cost of construction, $182million, was considered too expensive, and the proposal was suspended in 2001. Since then, the Government has focused <b>on</b> <b>road</b> upgrades and an inner-city light rail extension.|$|E

There has been criticism because during the first ten years since the scheme was implemented, gross revenue reached about £2.6 billion, but only £1.2 billion has been invested, meaning that 54% of gross revenues have been spent in operating the system and administrative expenses.|$|E
5|$|The chassis was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm.

5|$|The songs <b>on</b> <b>Road</b> to Ruin were {{considered}} by both fans and critics {{as an attempt}} to get the band more airplay. The album incorporated musical elements which were unheard of in punk rock, such as guitar solos and ballads. The difference in style caused for mixed reviews by critics, with many pointing out that the band was trying to sell more records through a change in form. This attempt by the band failed, as Road to Ruin debuted at 103 on the Billboard 200, nearly 50 places behind its predecessor Rocket to Russia.|$|E

5|$|Typically found growing solitary, {{in groups}} or in {{clusters}} under hardwood trees, the fungus produces fruit {{bodies in the}} summer and autumn. In the New England area of the United States, mycologist Howard Bigelow has noted it to grow <b>on</b> <b>road</b> shoulders in grass near oaks; it also has a predilection for growing on sloping creek banks. In Malaysia, it is found growing on the soil in forests, mostly under species of Shorea (rainforest trees in the family Dipterocarpaceae). C.lateritius has been reported from the Western Ghats, Kerala, India, forming ectomycorrhizal association with endemic tree species like Vateria indica, Hopea parviflora, Diospyros malabarica, Myristica malabarica in semi-evergreen to evergreen forests.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013 Van Dijk {{announced}} that she signed a three-year contract with Boels Dolmans Cycling Team. She is a teammate of among others Lizzie Armitstead, Katarzyna Pawłowska and Christine Majerus. The time trial at the 2016 Summer Olympics will be her big goal. She will keep her focus on time trials, world cup races and flat short stage races. Due to her focus <b>on</b> <b>road</b> cycling, she will not compete on the track. Van Dijk {{was not able to}} start in the Ladies Tour of Qatar because she did not recover in time from an illness after riding mountainbikerace Egmond-pier-Egmond. She got back her shape during the first races and just missed the podium in the GP Le Samyn.
