40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{determinants of}} ex-manufacturer prices <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> and generic drugs across a large sample of countries. We focus on drugs to treat HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria in middle and low income countries (MLICs), with robustness checks to other therapeutic categories and other countries. We examine effects of per capita income, income dispersion, number {{and type of}} therapeutic and generic competitors, and whether the drugs are sold to retail pharmacies vs. tendered procurement by NGOs. The cross-national income elasticity of prices is 0. 4 across high and low income countries, but is only 0. 15 between MLICs, implying that drugs are least affordable relative to income in the lowest income countries. Within-country income inequality contributes to relatively high prices in MLICs. Number of therapeutic and generic competitors only weakly affects prices to retail pharmacies, plausibly because uncertain quality leads to competition on brand rather than price. Tendered procurement attracts multi-national generic suppliers and significantly reduces prices <b>for</b> <b>originators</b> and generics, compared to prices to retail pharmacies. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background To {{evaluate}} medicine prices, {{availability and}} affordability in Brazil, considering the differences across {{three types of}} medicines (originator brands, generics and similar medicines) and different types of facilities (private pharmacies, public sector pharmacies and “popular pharmacies”). Methods Data on prices and availability of 50 medicines were collected in 56 pharmacies across six cities in Southern Brazil using the World Health Organization / Health Action International methodology. Median prices obtained were divided by international reference prices to derive the median price ratio (MPR). Results In the private sector, prices were 8. 6 MPR for similar medicines, 11. 3 MRP for generics and 18. 7 MRP <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> brands, respectively. Mean availability was 65 %, 74 % and 48 % <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> brands, generics and similar medicines, respectively. In the public sector, mean availability of similar medicines was 2 – 7 times {{higher than that of}} generics. Mean overall availability in the public sector ranged from 68. 8 % to 81. 7 %. In “popular pharmacies”, mean availability was greater than 90 % in all cities. Conclusions Availability of medicines in the public sector does not meet the challenge of supplying essential medicines to the entire population, as stated in the Brazilian constitution. This has unavoidable repercussions for affordability, particularly amongst the lower socio-economic strata. </p...|$|R

40|$|Twitch mouth {{pressure}} (Pmo,tw) during magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) were recently proposed as alternative noninvasive methods for assessing inspiratory muscle strength. This study aimed to compare their reproducibility with maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) in normal subjects. Ten healthy subjects were studied at {{functional residual capacity}} in semirecumbent position. Cervical magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation was performed during gentle expiration against an occlusion incorporating a small leak. Constancy of stimulation was controlled by recording diaphragmatic electromyogram. Within and between-session reproducibility of pressure were studied for Pmo,tw, SNIP, and MIP. The subjects were studied during a session of 10 manoeuvres repeated after 1 day and 1 month. The mean values were 16 cmH 2 <b>O</b> <b>for</b> Pmo,tw, 118 cmH 2 <b>O</b> <b>for</b> SNIP, and 115 cmH 2 <b>O</b> <b>for</b> MIP. For the three tests, the within subject variation was small in relation to between-subject variation, with the intraclass correlation coefficient ranging 0. 79 - 0. 90 for Pmo,tw, 0. 85 - 0. 92 for SNIP, and 0. 88 - 0. 92 for MIP. At 1 day interval, the coefficient of repeatability (2 SD of differences) was 3. 6 cmH 2 <b>O</b> <b>for</b> Pmo,tw, 32 cmH 2 <b>O</b> <b>for</b> SNIP and 28 cmH 2 <b>O</b> <b>for</b> MIP. At 1 month interval, the coefficient of repeatability was 5. 8 cmH 2 <b>O</b> <b>for</b> Pmo,tw, 23 cmH 2 <b>O</b> <b>for</b> SNIP and 21 cmH 2 <b>O</b> <b>for</b> MIP. We conclude that the within session reproducibility of the new tests twitch {{mouth pressure}} and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure is sufficient to be clinically useful. For sniff nasal inspiratory pressure, the between session reproducibility established after 1 day was maintained after 1 month. For twitch mouth pressure, the between session reproducibility declined slightly after 1 month. These characteristics should be considered when using these methods to follow an individual patient over time...|$|R

40|$|This paper evaluates {{medicine}} prices, their {{availability and}} affordability in Brazil, considering the differences across {{three types of}} medicines on the market (originator brands, generics and similar medicines) and different types of facilities (private pharmacies, public sector pharmacies and “popular pharmacies”), using an established methodology. Data on prices and availability of 50 medicines (originator brand, lowestpriced generic and similar medicines) were collected from public, private and popular pharmacies (N= 56) across six cities in Southern Brazil. Median prices obtained are divided by international reference prices to derive the median price ratio (MPR). In the private sector, prices were 8. 6 MPR for similar medicines, 11. 3 MRP for generics and 18. 7 MRP <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> brands, respectively. Mean availability was 65 %, 74 % and 48 % <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> brands, generics and similars, respectively. The number of working days needed {{to pay for a}} complete medicine treatment (affordability) varied considerably between medicines aimed at treating acute and chronic diseases and by type of medicine. In the public sector, the mean availability of similar medicines was 2 - 7 times higher than that of generics. The mean overall availability in the public sector ranged from 68. 8 % to 81. 7 %. In “popular pharmacies”, mean availability was greater than 90 % in all cities. This analysis finds that availability of medicines in the public sector does not meet the challenge for supplying essential medicines to the entire population, as stated in the Brazilian constitution. This has unavoidable repercussions for affordability, particularly amongst the lower socio-economic strata. Policies targeted to reduce the prices of the generics need to be implemented in Brazil, as well as making them more widely available. Popular pharmacies may help overcome the lack of medicines in the public sector, but the limited number of medicines distributed in these facilities is of concern...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the extent of generic {{competition}} in European countries, given an understanding of these countries' different pharmaceutical price regulations and health care structures. In particular, this study investigates generic competition among the five largest European pharmaceutical markets; the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, with comprehensive IMS data set for 10 years (1994 - 2003), in order to estimate the effect of generic entry on drug prices at the product level. Both within and across these countries, different interventions are being applied to in-patent and off-patent markets during 10 years of the study period. For example, in Germany, markets for on-patent drugs are largely unregulated and prices are set relatively freely; however, once generics enter the market, the German government uses reference pricing to set reimbursement rates. In the UK, originator medicine prices are free from direct regulatory intervention, but are subject to a rate of return regulation. Additionally, once generics enter the market, the UK's government uses price caps. France, Italy, and Spain, on the other hand, use direct price controls <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> drugs and reference pricing system for generic drugs. Accordingly, this analysis finds that generic entry has a negative effect on prices in countries with free pricing originator market, whereas in European Union (EU) countries with strict price and reimbursement regulation, generic competition is ineffective and/or counterproductive. Low regulated prices <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> products do not encourage generic entry following patent expiration. This finding is consistent with less generic firms and less competitive late entrants in regulated environments. Thus, strict price regulation undermines price competition in the off-patent sector, and cost savings from post-patent competition are not realized in countries with strict pricing and reimbursement policies...|$|R
