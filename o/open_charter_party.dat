50|$|On 15 March <b>Charter</b> <b>Party,</b> ridden by Dunwoody, {{started at}} odds of 10/1 for the 61st {{running of the}} Cheltenham Gold Cup. With Desert Orchid {{switched}} to contest the Queen Mother Champion Chase, the favourite for the race was Play School, a New Zealand-bred gelding who had won the Welsh National and the Vincent O'Brien Gold Cup since relocating to Britain. The other contenders included Rhyme 'n' Reason, Run and Skip, Forgive 'n' Forget (winner of the race in 1985), Cybrandian (runner-up in 1987), the French Challenger Nupsala (King George VI Chase), Kildimo (RSA Chase) and the diminutive but improving Cavvies Clown. Dunwoody settled <b>Charter</b> <b>Party</b> just behind the leaders as Beau Ranger set the early pace from Cybrandian. By {{the end of the}} first circuit Golden Friend had moved to the front from Cavvies Clown and Run and Skip with <b>Charter</b> <b>Party</b> well placed in fifth. Cavvies Clown took the lead early on the second circuit and took the fourth last in front from <b>Charter</b> <b>Party,</b> whilst Forgive 'n' Forget who appeared to be travelling best of all in third sustained a serious leg injury and was immediately pulled up. With most of the other runners beginning to struggle, the Gold Cup became two-horse race, with Cavvies Clown turning into the straight a length in front of <b>Charter</b> <b>Party.</b> When Cavvies Clown jumped poorly at the penultimate fence and began to hang to the right, Dunwoody sent <b>Charter</b> <b>Party</b> into the lead on the inside. <b>Charter</b> <b>Party</b> jumped the last fence in front and maintained his advantage on the run-in to win by six lengths, with Beau Ranger another ten lengths back in third place.|$|R

40|$|Bulk {{cargo ships}} are usually {{contracted}} under the <b>Charter</b> <b>Party</b> contract between {{the owner and}} the shipper. This contract establishes a time limit for vessel to stay at port. If the vessel is below this time the shipper receives a financial award and, if not, pay a fine to the owner. After the literature review, no articles {{were found on the}} Berth Allocation Problem (BAP) that addressed the issues related to premium and fine from the perspective of <b>Charter</b> <b>Party</b> contract in order to maximize the financial result of the shipper, calculated as a reward less fine. Thus, a mathematical model is proposed for the BAP with consideration of the <b>Charter</b> <b>Party,</b> and instances based in the Port of Tubar√£o were developed and implemented in CPLEX 12. 6.

5000|$|COGSA, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, {{does not}} apply of its own force to <b>charter</b> <b>parties,</b> but does apply to bills of lading issued to a shipper by the {{charterer}} (in the US) in conjunction with charterer's operations. As a practical matter, many <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> forms stipulate the applicability of COGSA or the Harter Act to the relations between owner and charterer. Such a stipulation is valid and enforceable even without the issuance of a bill of lading. Lawsuits brought for the breach of an obligation under a <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> are generally within the admiralty jurisdiction. As long as the agreement is executory, for inadequate performance the remedy is in personam which allows the plaintiff to go to state court under the [...] "saving to suitors" [...] clause. If, however, a charter breach creates a maritime lien, the suit is in rem, against the vessel itself, with exclusive admiralty jurisdiction.|$|R
50|$|<b>Charter</b> <b>Party</b> {{remained}} in training {{for two more}} seasons but failed to win again, and became increasingly subject to his leg problems. In December 1988 he finished last when carrying top weight of 168 pounds in the Rehearsal Chase at Chepstow and then came home last of the five runners behind Desert Orchid in the King George VI Chase at Kempton. In February he finished last of four behind Desert Orchid in the Gainborough Chase and then fell in the Vincent O'Brien Gold Cup, which was won by Carvill's Hill. On 16 March, <b>Charter</b> <b>Party</b> started a 14/1 outsider as he attempted to repeat his 1988 success in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Desert Orchid started favourite, whilst the other runners included Carvill's Hill, Cavvies Clown, The Thinker, West Tip and Ten Plus. In a race run on heavy ground <b>Charter</b> <b>Party</b> {{was one of the}} few runners to cope with the conditions and raced prominently throughout before finishing third behind Desert Orchid and Yahoo. The gelding fell at the twelfth fence in the Martell Cup at Aintree Racecourse and unseated Dunwoody at the final fence when favourite for the Golden Miller Chase at Cheltenham in April.

50|$|In the 1984/5 National Hunt season, <b>Charter</b> <b>Party</b> was matched against more {{experienced}} chasers.

Later that spring he won again at Newbury and finished second to Aces Wild at Cheltenham in April. On his first appearance of the next season <b>Charter</b> <b>Party</b> fell in the Hennessy Gold Cup, before winning at Kempton Park on Boxing Day, but then ran poorly at Windsor in January. In March 1986 <b>Charter</b> <b>Party</b> made his second appearance at the Cheltenham Festival and carried 150 pounds in the National Hunt Handicap Chase. Ridden as in most of his previous races by Peter Scudamore, he won from a field which included the previous year's winner West Tip.

5|$|The Worldwide Tanker Normal Freight Scale, often {{referred}} to as Worldscale, is established and governed jointly by the Worldscale Associations of London and New York. Worldscale establishes a baseline price for carrying a metric ton of product between any two ports in the world. In Worldscale negotiations, operators and charterers will determine a price based on a percentage of the Worldscale rate. The baseline rate is expressed as WS 100. If a given <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> settled on 85% of the Worldscale rate, it would be expressed as WS 85. Similarly, a <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> set at 125% of the Worldscale rate would be expressed as WS 125.|$|R

30|$|The term ‚Äòtramp {{shipping}} optimisation‚Äô {{refers to}} the use of OR to maximise the revenue or minimise the cost of a tramp shipping problem, subject to the limited shipping resources. One such tramp shipping problem exists when there are some ships and some cargoes and it is required to find out the cargo mix assigned to each ship voyage which maximises total gross profit per day for all ships, subject to ship capacity and cargo time window (lay can). Name this problem area ‚Äòoptimisation of ship voyage‚Äô. To give more details on this area, consider the following facts. Unlike ‚Äòoptimisation in liner shipping‚Äô, both ports of call and port calling sequence are here assumed optional. <b>Charter</b> <b>party,</b> signed by the ship owner and the charterer, usually specifies terms and clauses to be followed by both <b>parties.</b> Non-demise voyage <b>charter</b> <b>parties</b> are assumed here. Terms generally include the following items: calling ports, calling sequence, cargo freight, cargo time window (lay can), allowable cargo handling time (lay days), dispatch count if actual days are less than lay days, and demurrage count if more. Loading and discharging lay days may be considered in reversible or irreversible manner. If reversible, lay days are specified for loading and discharging collectively. If irreversible, lay days are specified for loading and discharging separately. The gross terms of voyage <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> are here assumed unless otherwise specified. Before cargoes are being fixed by the ship owner, ‚Äòoptimisation of ship voyage‚Äô helps in proposing a voyage plan suggesting an optimal cargo mix for each ship. This mix maximises the sum of voyage gross profit per day for all ships, subject to ship capacity, cargo lay can, and other voyage <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> terms. In the cargo mix selection, the random nature of sea transport demand has to be considered.|$|R
