5|$|The {{concept and}} origin <b>of</b> <b>Burnt</b> Norton is {{connected}} to Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral. The poem discusses the idea {{of time and the}} concept that only the present moment really matters because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{second section}} {{discusses}} disorder within nature, which is opposite {{to the discussion}} of order within nature found in the second section <b>of</b> <b>Burnt</b> Norton. Also, rational knowledge itself is described as being inadequate for explaining reality. Those who pursue only reason and science are ignorant. Even our progress is not progress {{as we continue to}} repeat the same errors as the past.|$|E

5|$|All {{excavated}} tombs were intrusive burials interred under residential platforms. They {{were all}} {{found in a}} squatting position without any particular orientation. Many of the remains were found accompanied by a broken obsidian blade. Some burials had other offerings, for example that of a woman accompanied by domestic utensils, {{some of which were}} blackened with soot. Two child burials each had a jade bead and the burial of an elderly male was accompanied by pieces <b>of</b> <b>burnt</b> pine and evergreen oak.|$|E
5|$|The central {{discussion}} {{within the}} poem is {{on the nature of}} time and salvation. Eliot emphasises the need of the individual to focus on the present moment and to {{know that there is a}} universal order. By understanding the nature of time and the order of the universe, mankind is able to recognise God and seek redemption. Many reviewers <b>of</b> <b>Burnt</b> Norton focused on the uniqueness and beauty of the poem. However, others complained that the poem does not reflect Eliot's earlier greatness and that the use of Christian themes harmed the poem.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, {{there was}} a full reading of the one-act version of the play. Despite an {{unfinished}} script and a performance by amateur actors, it evoked a strong response from the audience. Later that year, Stephen Waldschmidt, an artistic associate <b>of</b> <b>Burnt</b> Thicket Theatre, asked to read the script of She Has a Name, and later {{said he could not}} put it down. He was initially reluctant to attach himself to the play because of the immensity and ugliness of the issues therein, but he ultimately worked with Kooman to expand it into a full-length play with an extra hour of material by the end of 2010. The result is a play that can be performed in 90 minutes but may last up to two hours. Burnt Thicket Theatre served as the play's initial production company.|$|E

5|$|Although Curtis was {{personally}} opposed to British possession of Gibraltar, he took command of a marine unit during the siege, {{and in the}} attack by Spanish gunboats and floating batteries in September 1782, Curtis took his men into the harbour in small boats to engage the enemy. During this operation, Curtis witnessed {{the destruction of the}} batteries by British fireships and was able to rescue hundreds <b>of</b> <b>burnt</b> and drowning Spanish sailors from the water. This rescue effort was carried out in close proximity to the enemy force and in constant danger from the detonation of burning Spanish ships, which showered his overcrowded boats with debris and caused several casualties amongst his crews. When Lord Howe relieved the siege, he brought the much-celebrated Curtis back to Britain, where he was knighted for his service and became a society figure, featuring in many newspaper prints. He came under attack however from Lieutenant Campbell, who published a pamphlet accusing him of indecision and a lack of nerve during his time in Brilliant.|$|E

25|$|Now in {{the town}} of Ballston, NY50 retains the Saratoga Road moniker, {{crossing}} northeast into the hamlet <b>of</b> <b>Burnt</b> Hills. In the center <b>of</b> <b>Burnt</b> Hills, NY50 intersects with CR58 (Lake Hill Road) and CR339 (Lake Hill Road), which once served as the western terminus of NY339. Continuing northeast out <b>of</b> <b>Burnt</b> Hills, NY50 crosses a junction with CR110 (Kingsley Road). At a junction with Larkin Road, NY50 turns northward, reaching a junction with the northern terminus of NY146A (Midline Road). Continuing northwest through Ballston, the route remains a two-lane residential roadway, soon turning north near a junction with Charlton Road.|$|E
