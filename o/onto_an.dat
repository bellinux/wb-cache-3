5|$|EK Trianguli Australis, a dwarf nova of the SU Ursae Majoris type, {{was first}} noticed in 1978 and officially {{described}} in 1980. It {{consists of a}} white dwarf and a donor star which orbit each other every 1.5 hours. The white dwarf sucks matter from the other star <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> accretion disc and periodically erupts, reaching magnitude 11.2 in superoutbursts, 12.1 in normal outbursts and remaining at magnitude 16.7 when quiet. Nova Trianguli Australis 2008 was a slow nova which peaked at magnitude 8.4 in April 2008, before fading to magnitude 12.4 by September of that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Macartney joined North Sydney Cricket Club in {{the first}} {{division}} of Sydney Grade Cricket and then moved to the Gordon club in the outer northern suburbs when it was formed during the 1905–06 season.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} multi-objective genetic {{algorithm}} {{to solve the problem}} of mapping a set of task graphs <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> heterogeneous multiprocessor platform.

Our approach allows for mapping <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> fixed platform or <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> flexible platform where architectural changes are explored during the mapping. We demonstrate our approach through an exploration of a smart phone, where five task graphs with a total of 530 tasks after hyper period extension are mapped <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> multiprocessor platform. The results show four non-inferior solutions which tradeoffs the various objectives...|$|R
5|$|SX Leonis Minoris is a dwarf nova of the SU Ursae Majoris {{type that}} was {{identified}} in 1994. It {{consists of a}} white dwarf and a donor star, which orbit each other every 97minutes. The white dwarf sucks matter from the other star <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> accretion disc and heats up to between 6000 and 10000 K. The dwarf star erupts every 34 to 64days, reaching magnitude 13.4 in these outbursts and remaining at magnitude 16.8 when quiet. Leo Minor contains another dwarf nova, RZ Leonis Minoris, which brightens to magnitude 14.2 from a baseline magnitude of around 17 but does so at shorter intervals than other dwarf novae.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{instances}} include removing {{of parts}} from the mould {{immediately after the}} parts are created, as well as applying machine vision systems. A robot grips the part after the ejector pins have been extended to free the part from the mould. It then moves them into either a holding location or directly <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> inspection system. The choice depends upon the type of product, {{as well as the}} general layout of the manufacturing equipment. Vision systems mounted on robots have greatly enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A mobile robot can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal component, and inspect faster than a human can.|$|E

Alongside Highway 404 to the east is an industrial warehouse and commercial office area, while on the west is a suburban subdivision of North York. Northbound, the freeway is six lanes wide from Sheppard Avenue to Finch Avenue, where one lane diverges <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> off-ramp, re-emerging north of Finch. Southbound, it is six lanes wide from Steeles south to Sheppard.|$|E

5|$|In the {{commercial}} {{center of the}} community, NY117 serves the Bedford Hills Metro-North station before widening to four lanes as it crosses the railroad tracks and connects to exit39 of the Saw Mill River Parkway. For the next mile (1.6km), NY117 runs alongside {{the northern edge of}} the Saw Mill River Parkway as it heads through another residential part of Bedford Hills as a two-lane road. At Harris Road, the route turns southeastward, crossing the parkway and the adjacent railroad tracks again as it intersects with the parkway's exit42. NY117's southeastward run on Harris Road ends just past the railroad crossing, where the highway turns northeast <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> unnamed road leading to a commercial and industrial area south of the hamlet of Katonah. After turning onto the highway, NY117 serves various businesses before the route ends at the southbound-only exit43 of the Saw Mill River Parkway. NY117 northbound feeds into the northbound direction of the parkway, while exit43 serves as the start of NY117 southbound.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} to operational flying in early 1941 in 616 Squadron, which was forming {{part of the}} Tangmere Wing. Johnson often found himself flying alongside Wing Commander Douglas Bader and Australian ace Tony Gaze. On 15 January 1941, Johnson, the recently appointed Squadron Leader Burton and Pilot Officer Hugh Dundas, who arrived back at the squadron on 13 September 1940, took off to offer cover for a convoy off North Coates. The controller vectored the pair <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> enemy aircraft, a Dornier Do 17. Both attacked the bomber and lost sight of it and each other. Although the controllers intercepted distress signals from the bomber Johnson did not see it crash. They were credited with one enemy aircraft damaged.
