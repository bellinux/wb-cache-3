5|$|While {{people have}} used canning and {{artificial}} refrigeration to preserve {{food for the}} last hundred years or so, salt has been the best-known food preservative, especially for meat, for many thousands of years. A very ancient salt-works <b>operation</b> <b>has</b> been discovered at the Poiana Slatinei archaeological site next to a salt spring in Lunca, Neamț County, Romania. Evidence indicates that Neolithic people of the Precucuteni Culture were boiling the salt-laden spring water through the process of briquetage to extract the salt as far back as 6050 BC. The salt extracted from this operation may have had a direct correlation to the rapid growth of this society's population soon after its initial production began. The harvest of salt from the surface of Xiechi Lake near Yuncheng in Shanxi, China, dates back to at least 6000 BC, {{making it one of the}} oldest verifiable saltworks.|$|E
5|$|On 1July, TF38 sailed from Leyte {{to strike}} at the Japanese home islands. At this time the Task Force {{comprised}} nine fleet carriers, six light carriers and their escorts. Halsey sought to coordinate his fleet's attacks during {{the last months of}} the war with those of the USAAF's land-based aircraft, but the two forces often operated separately. On 10July TF38's aircraft conducted raids on airfields in the Tokyo region, destroying several aircraft on the ground. No Japanese fighters were encountered in the air, however, as they were being kept in reserve for a planned large-scale suicide attack on the Allied fleet. Following this raid TF38 steamed north, and began a major attack on Hokkaido and northern Honshu on 14July. These strikes continued the next day, and sank eight of the 12 railway car ferries which carried coal from Hokkaido to Honshu and damaged the remaining four. Many other ships were also destroyed in this area, including 70 out of the 272 small sailing ships which carried coal between the islands. Once again no Japanese aircraft opposed this attack, though 25 were destroyed on the ground. The loss of the railway car ferries reduced the amount of coal shipped from Hokkaido to Honshu by 80percent, which greatly hindered production in Honshu's factories. This <b>operation</b> <b>has</b> been described as the single most effective strategic air attack of the Pacific War. TF38's battleships and cruisers also began a series of bombardments of industrial targets on 14July which continued until almost the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|The first {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} tracheal intubation and subsequent artificial respiration of animals were from Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) of Brussels. In his landmark book published in 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, he described an experiment in which he passed a reed into the trachea of a dying animal whose thorax had been opened and maintained ventilation by blowing into the reed intermittently. Antonio Musa Brassavola (1490–1554) of Ferrara successfully treated a patient suffering from peritonsillar abscess by tracheotomy. Brassavola published his account in 1546; this <b>operation</b> <b>has</b> been identified as the first recorded successful tracheotomy, despite the many previous references to this operation. Towards {{the end of the}} 16th century, Hieronymus Fabricius (1533–1619) described a useful technique for tracheotomy in his writings, although he had never actually performed the operation himself. Fabricius was the first to introduce the idea of a tracheostomy tube. In 1620 the French surgeon Nicholas Habicot (1550–1624) published a report of four successful tracheotomies. In 1714, anatomist Georg Detharding (1671–1747) of the University of Rostock performed a tracheotomy on a drowning victim.|$|E
