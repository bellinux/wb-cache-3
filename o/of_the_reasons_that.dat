5|$|The {{difficulty}} in capturing {{the complexity and}} subtleties of the many methods by which antibody drugs can be produced is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> the INN dropped the source substem.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics have {{no effect}} against viral infections or against the viruses that cause the common cold. Due to their side effects, {{antibiotics}} cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{achievements}} {{and support for}} Catholics were particularly praised by Bob Santamaria, the unofficial leader and guiding influence of the Democratic Labor Party (DLP). The DLP had broken away from the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the nation's main centre-left social democratic party. The split occurred in the 1950s during the McCarthyism scares, as the Catholic factions broke away to form the DLP {{on the basis that}} the ALP was too lenient towards communists. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> Menzies strongly backed Diệm was to gain further favour with the DLP and accentuate the divisions among his left wing opponents.|$|E
50|$|Since Lotus Notes 8.5, IBM {{started to}} change the term Database to Application, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> these files are not really object {{databases}} as mentioned above.|$|R
50|$|Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Narrows are so notable {{is because}} they have a {{downward}} gradient of over 100 feet per mile. <b>The</b> entire section <b>of</b> river is about 3 miles in length.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{conventional}} nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poem, what Evelyn Simpson called its [...] "frigid conceit," [...] {{is perhaps}} a large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> this poem is not among <b>the</b> most famous <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sonnets today.|$|R
5|$|Long-standing rivalries {{result in}} {{numerous}} rematches, especially {{if one of}} the enforcers has to decline an invitation to fight during a given game. This is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> enforcers may fight {{at the beginning of a}} game, when nothing obvious has happened to agitate the opponents. On the other hand, it is bad etiquette to try to initiate a fight with an enforcer who is near the end of his shift, since the more rested player will have an obvious advantage.|$|E
5|$|The {{issues of}} federalism, {{ethnicity}} {{in politics and}} state centralisation were not resolved by the crisis and partly contributed {{to a decline in}} support for the concept of the state among Congolese people. Mobutu was strongly in favour of centralisation and one of his first acts, in 1965, were to reunify provinces and abolish much of their independent legislative capacity. Subsequent loss of faith in central government is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> the Congo has been labeled as a failed state, and has contributed violence by factions advocating ethnic and localised federalism.|$|E
5|$|The {{aristocracy}} {{shared their}} power {{only with the}} Roman Catholic Church. The Church ruled by fear of damnation in the next life and of the Inquisition in the present, and consequently both upper and lower classes gave as generously as they could on all major saints' days. Many priests and bishops {{were members of the}} aristocracy. The wealth of the Church in Sicily was further enhanced by the tradition of pressing younger children of the aristocracy to enter monasteries and convents, in order to preserve the family estates from division; a large fee, or dowry, was usually paid to the Church to facilitate this, in the form of property, jewels, or money. Thus the wealth of certain religious orders grew out of all proportion to the economic growth of any other group at this time. This is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> so many of the Sicilian Baroque churches and monasteries, such as San Martino delle Scale, were rebuilt after 1693 on such a lavish scale.|$|E
50|$|Mapperley Tunnel was {{extremely}} unstable due to mining subsidence {{and the heavy}} traffic through it. In 1925 part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof collapsed, blocking the line, and this was part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> this section <b>of</b> line closed prematurely.|$|R
50|$|In some localities, <b>the</b> {{moisture}} content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precipitation {{from the storm}} exceeded 3 inches (76 mm) This was probably part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snowpack generated by this storm persisted into late April 2010 in some locations.|$|R
50|$|Franklin stated new {{features}} such as Sim emotions, advanced Sim animation, interaction and behaviours, {{as well as the}} new Create-a-Sim and build mode tools as a large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> detracted focus from {{features such as}} swimming pools and the toddler life stage.|$|R

Mobutu was strongly in favour of centralisation and one of his first acts, in 1965, were to reunify provinces and abolish much of their independent legislative capacity. Subsequent loss of faith in central government is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> the Congo has been labeled as a failed state, and has contributed violence by factions advocating ethnic and localised federalism. Local insurgencies continued in the eastern Congo into the 1980s left a legacy of instability along the Congo's eastern borders.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the scope}} of a popular {{comparison}} that draws parallels between House and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, Wilson is equivalent to Doctor Watson. In two-parts episodes such as Euphoria, Part 1 and Euphoria, Part 2, and House's Head and Wilson's Heart, Wilson's voice is heard narrating the story, while Dr. Watson is the character who narrates the stories in most of Sherlock Holmes novels. Leonard has said that his character and House were originally intended to play roles similar to Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes, respectively, in the series although he believes that House's team has {{assumed the role of}} Watson since the show has begun. Producer Katie Jacobs believes that Wilson and House both hide from mature relationships, which brings the two closer together. She has said that {{the difference between the two}} characters is that Wilson finds it hard to say no because he wants to please the other person. The similarities between Dr. Wilson and Dr. Watson was also one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> made Leonard choose House over Numb3rs.|$|E
25|$|Geisel wrote most of {{his books}} in anapestic tetrameter, a poetic meter {{employed}} by many poets of the English literary canon. This is often suggested as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> Geisel's writing was so well received.|$|E
50|$|The Lodge's {{building}} (the Overton Lodge Masonic Temple) {{is listed}} on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as a contributing property in the Rogersville Historic District; as such, it is an historically-significant part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> district was itself included on the National Register.|$|R
50|$|The Lidov-Kozai {{mechanism}} causes <b>the</b> argument <b>of</b> pericenter (ω) to librate {{about either}} 90° or 270°, {{which is to}} say that its periapse occurs when the body is farthest from the equatorial plane. This effect is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Pluto is dynamically protected from close encounters with Neptune.|$|R
5000|$|Verwer's {{first contact}} with Christianity was through his neighbor, Dorothea Clapp, {{who gave him}} <b>the</b> Gospel <b>of</b> John and also put him on her [...] "Holy Ghost hit list". Verwer {{attributes}} to her some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> he {{made a commitment to}} Christ, and for what resulted in his life.|$|R
25|$|This is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> scuba {{regulators}} are generally constructed from brass, and chrome plated (for protection). Brass, with its good thermal conductive properties, quickly conducts {{heat from the}} surrounding water to the cold, newly decompressed air, helping to prevent icing up.|$|E
25|$|Jones cites {{private schools}} as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> Britain remains as {{socially}} stratified as it is. Among the advantages {{in private schools}} compared to state schools, Jones listed smaller classroom sizes, highly trained teachers, better facilities, and coaching through university interviews.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, Carleton S. Coon {{said that}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> Mongoloids have flatter faces than Caucasoids {{is due to the}} {{masseter}} and temporalis jaw muscles in the faces of Mongoloids being positioned more {{toward the front of the}} faces of Mongoloids relative to where these jaw muscles are positioned in the faces of Caucasoids.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{possible}} <b>that</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> churches remain segregated is because that society and communities at large are very segregated, and that churches are merely a reflection of this. This view is reified {{by the fact that}} racial differences are highly correlated with differences in income and socioeconomic class.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, Barticciotto {{made his}} return to Colo-Colo. He regained his form and was an {{important}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Colo-Colo would win three straight championships from 1996-1998. In his final season, 2002, Colo-Colo {{would go on to}} win his seventh championship but was not a fixture in the starting line-up for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season.|$|R
50|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more {{interesting}} facts of Quito {{is that the}} stadiums are located over 2,800 m above sea level, this gives the city the special feature and a great advantage for local teams when they play against foreign teams {{and it is one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> has allowed Ecuador to participate in the last two World Cups.|$|R
25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> {{blood tests}} are not {{reliable}} for accurate peptic ulcer diagnosis {{on their own}} is their inability to differentiate between past exposure to the bacteria and current infection. Additionally, a false negative result is possible with a blood test if the person has recently been taking certain drugs, such as antibiotics or proton-pump inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of their westward explorations and their {{settlement}} of Greenland, the Vikings sailed as far north and west as Ellesmere Island, Skraeling Island and Ruin Island for hunting expeditions and trading with Inuit groups. The subsequent arrival of the Little Ice Age is thought to have been one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> European seafaring into the Northwest Passage ceased until the late 15th century.|$|E
25|$|Bilateral {{meetings}} between both nations reached unexpected highs between 2009–2011 and cooperations {{between the two}} nations remain excellent with several forms of cooperation that include science, economics, education, and culture as emphasized by Lithuanian Foreign Minister Audronius Azubalis. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite has stated Israel as model of innovation in which is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> Lithuania is interested in enhancing its bilateral relations.|$|E
50|$|Whilst on the host, the louse feeds {{upon the}} hair, skin, and {{secretions}} that are present. B. bovis does not feed on blood. This is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> these lice {{are able to}} survive and thrive off <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cattle. This form of parasitism is minimally invasive and ensures the host and its parasite can co-exist.|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason of}} his staying alive {{is that he}} also {{possesses}} a very awake, alert, and active mind. He changes strategies while executing one. He comes up with tricks and ideas {{that are hard to}} beat. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> he could not be kept imprisoned for long is his quick backup schemes and arrangements.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> Circles <b>of</b> Sustainability {{assessment}} of Delhi gives a marginally more favourable impression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ecological sustainability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city {{only because it}} is based on a more comprehensive series of measures than only air pollution. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city remains assessed at basic sustainability is because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low resource-use and carbon emissions of its poorer neighbourhoods.|$|R
25|$|Size {{of youth}} {{population}}. “In 2010, {{more than a}} quarter of the world’s total population (27%) was under the age of 15.” Christian youth under 15 were the same as the 27% global average. But an even higher percentage of Muslims (34%) were younger than 15. This higher youth population is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> from 2010-2050 Muslims are projected to grow faster than Christians.|$|E
25|$|Trust law {{in civil}} law jurisdictions, {{generally}} including Continental Europe only {{exists in a}} limited number of jurisdictions (e.g. Curaçao, Liechtenstein and Sint Maarten). The trust may however be recognized as an instrument of foreign law in conflict of laws cases, for example within the Brussels regime (Europe) and the parties to the Hague Trust Convention. Tax avoidance concerns have historically been one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> European countries with a civil law system have been reluctant to adopt trusts.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{base fabric}} {{on which the}} images are embroidered is a woven purple gauze, {{which may have been}} imported; the later replica sections are stitched onto purple twill or plain white silk. The embroidery threads of the original are z-twisted (right laid) and are sewn exclusively in backstitch while the replica uses looser s-twisted yarn and a variety of different stitches. The looser twist of the yarn may be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> the replica sections are less well-preserved.|$|E
5000|$|One further {{response}} would be to take Willard Van Orman Quine's position and reject <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> conceptual analysis altogether. This is a natural response to <b>the</b> rejection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analytic-synthetic distinction. The fact that many philosophers have followed Quine in this direction is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> many now say that the term [...] "analytic philosophy" [...] is a misnomer.|$|R
50|$|Boland became Danny Wilson's first signing. His tough-tackling is {{something}} that Wilson had been looking {{to add to the}} squad and he agreed terms at The Vic after being out of contract at Cardiff in the summer. His leadership skills and experience were another part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Pools were quick to move for him when he became available.|$|R
50|$|According to {{psychologist}} and paranormal researcher Benjamin Radford, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> story was so well-received and accepted among its American Christian audience {{is that it}} reinforced their existing narratives and beliefs. By sticking closely to a widely accepted interpretation of heaven, God and demons, Malarkey was assured that his story would meet his audience’s expectations and be popular.|$|R
