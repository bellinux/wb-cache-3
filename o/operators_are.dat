40|$|A general {{procedure}} for constructing conserved electromagnetic current <b>operators</b> <b>is</b> given. The four-momentum operator in point form relativistic {{quantum mechanics is}} written as the sum of hadronic, photon, and electromagnetic four-momentum operators, where the electromagnetic four-momentum <b>operator</b> <b>is</b> generated from a vertex operator, in which a conserved current <b>operator</b> <b>is</b> contracted with the four-vector potential operator. The current <b>operator</b> <b>is</b> the sum of free, dynamically determined and model dependent operators, {{the sum of the}} first two constructed so as to be conserved with respect to the hadronic interactions.

5|$|Because {{the rail}} <b>{{operators}}</b> <b>are</b> government-assisted, profit-based corporations, fares on the MRT system are pitched {{to at least}} break-even level. The operators collect these fares by selling electronic data-storing tickets, the prices of which are calculated based on {{the distance between the}} start and destination stations. These prices increase in fixed stages for standard non-discounted travel. Fares are calculated in increments based on approximate distances between stations, in contrast to the use of fare zones in other subway systems, such as the London Underground.|$|E
5|$|By early 2016, delays as {{a result}} of {{overcrowding}} were up to more than 20,000 every month, four times the amount in 2012. The overcrowded trains have resulted in an increase of assaults because of tense commuters. With less platform space, more passengers are forced to be {{on the edge of the}} platform resulting in the increased possibility of passengers falling on the track. One possible solution that the MTA is considering is platform screen doors, which exist on the AirTrain JFK to prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. In order to prevent hitting passengers who could fall onto the tracks, train <b>operators</b> <b>are</b> being instructed to go into stations at lower speeds. The increased proximity of riders could result in the spread of contagious diseases.|$|E
