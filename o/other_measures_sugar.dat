Because sugar is the dominant compound in grape juice, these units are effectively a <b>measure</b> of <b>sugar</b> level. The level of sugar in the grapes determines the final alcohol content of the wine as well as indirect index of grape maturity. Brix (Bx for short) is measured in grams per hundred grams of solution, so 20 Bx means that 100 grams of juice contains 20gm of dissolved compounds. There are <b>other</b> common <b>measures</b> of <b>sugar</b> content of grapes, Specific gravity, Oechsle (Germany) and Beaume (France). In the French Baumé (Be° or Bé° for short) one Be° corresponds approximately to one percent alcohol. One Be° is equal to 1.8 Brix, that is 1.8 grams of sugar per one hundred grams. Therefore, to achieve one percent alcohol the winemaker adds 1.8 grams per 100 ml or 18 grams per liter — a practice known as chaptalization, which is illegal in some countries and in California.|$|R

40|$|Effective {{irrigation}} water management can only be achieved when up to date real time information on the irrigated area, crops grown, and the levels of crop water use are available. However, the spatial scale of most irrigation schemes limit effective collection of this data, since most schemes are covering hundreds to thousands of square kilometers. The rendering of data collection is both tedious and expensive, and it limits ground based monitoring of crop performance and production estimation. Employment of remote sensing, which uses synoptic and repetitive view, may be desired to compliment ground based methods. The research seeks to determine the relationship between satellite derived sugarcane water use and ground measured sugarcane water use at the study site, Hippo Valley Estates in Zimbabwe. It explores the application of remote sensing in estimating sugar cane water use by comparing the SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land) model of estimating evapotranspiration and the ground method of <b>measuring</b> <b>sugar</b> cane water use at Hippo Valley Estates. It is hypothesized {{that there is no}} significant relationship between Landsat Thematic Mapper images of derived sugar cane water use and the ground <b>measured</b> <b>sugar</b> cane water use. The research reveals that there is a significant (p< 0. 05) positive relationship (r= 0. 808466) between ground <b>measured</b> <b>sugar</b> cane water use and the Landsat derived satellite sugar cane water use. The study also reveals that the ground based method of <b>measuring</b> <b>sugar</b> cane water use has a major limitation of assuming spatial homogeneity for the ground values measured in different sections of Hippo Valley Estates unlike the satellite derived method of estimating sugar cane water use which gives actual values of evapotranspiration on a pixel by pixel basis. It is recommended that both of these methods are used simultaneously (satellite method should be used to monitor sugar cane water use, and validation tests for the results should be used through the ground method of <b>measuring</b> <b>sugar</b> cane water use) ...|$|R

Additionally he demonstrated the unrestricted intestinal absorption of fats in diabetics. He thus contributed to the scientific basis for a diabetic diet.

He thus anticipated modern principles of blood sugar measurements. Elsewhere he investigated the laxative qualities of lactose.|$|R
5000|$|Boiling {{the syrup}} is a tightly {{controlled}} process, which ensures appropriate sugar content. Syrup boiled too long will eventually crystallize, whereas under-boiled syrup will be watery, and will quickly spoil. The finished syrup has a density of 66° on the Brix scale (a hydrometric scale used to <b>measure</b> <b>sugar</b> solutions). The syrup is then filtered to remove sugar sand, crystals made up largely {{of sugar and}} calcium malate. These crystals are not toxic, but create a [...] "gritty" [...] texture in the syrup if not filtered out.|$|R
50|$|In principle, any {{technologies}} {{used for}} metabolomics {{can be used}} for exometabolomics. However, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been the most widely used. As with typical metabolomic measurements, metabolites are identified based on accurate mass, retention time, and their MS/MS fragmentation patterns, in comparison to authentic standards. Chromatographies typically used are hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography for the measurement of polar metabolites, or reversed-phase (C18) chromatography for the measurement of non-polar compounds, lipids, and secondary metabolites. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry {{can also be used to}} <b>measure</b> <b>sugars</b> and <b>other</b> carbohydrates, and to obtain complete metabolic profiles.|$|R

50|$|When oral {{rehydration}} salts packets {{and suitable}} teaspoons for <b>measuring</b> <b>sugar</b> and salt are not available, WHO has recommended that home made gruels, soups, etc. {{may be considered}} to help maintain hydration. A Lancet review in 2013 emphasized {{the need for more}} research on appropriate home made fluids to prevent dehydration. Sports drinks are not optimal oral rehydration solutions, but they can be used if optimal choices are not available. They should not be withheld for lack of better options; rehydration takes precedence. But they are not replacements for oral rehydration solutions in nonemergency situations.|$|R
50|$|Sugars {{also have}} known {{infrared}} absorption spectra {{and this has}} made it possible to develop instruments for <b>measuring</b> <b>sugar</b> concentration using NIR (Near Infra Red) and FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry) techniques. In the former case, in-line instruments are available which allow constant monitoring of sugar content in sugar refineries, beverage plants, wineries, etc. As with any other instruments, NIR and FT-IR instruments can be calibrated against pure sucrose solutions and thus report in °Bx, but there are other possibilities with these technologies, as they have the potential to distinguish between sugars and interfering substances.|$|R
