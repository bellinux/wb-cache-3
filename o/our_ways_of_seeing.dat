Productive interruption, as well as reciprocal reinforcement, is allowed by diffractions and their unpredictable and unintended effects: different realities and unforeseen possibilities can emerge from diffractive practices (Haraway in Schneider 2005 : 150).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{opposite}} of concrete. This article is partly an autobiographical {{reflection on the}} cultural, educational and linguistic influences that have shaped the author’s understanding of literacy development {{and the ability of}} language to create normative ways of seeing the world. ‘How do words influence <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing,</b> thinking and being? ’ is a guiding question throughout the piece. Drawing from the work of Ivan Illich, Erving Goffman and Edgar Friedenberg, this article suggests that schools are more concerned with institutionalizing knowledge and reproducing the power structures that govern our social exchanges than they are with education. The writing style and tone differ in structure and timbre from what is considered to be traditional in most academic forums – and all that jazz...|$|E
40|$|Recognising and {{protecting}} LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and intersex) identities and {{rights have been}} the central feature of contemporary global activisms around sexual diversity. In some countries, these identity-based movements have achieved a degree of acknowledgement and protection of LGBTI rights. However, as queer theorists have noted, this identification, specification, and categorisation of sexual desires might have limited the radical possibility of gender and sexual diversity into these narrow categories. In this paper I seek to explore alternative ways of being a sexual subject by examining a unique narrative from Naomi, an Indonesian Christian youth whom I interviewed during my doctoral study. This young person does not identify themself as man, nor woman, nor transgender; and they engages in the so-called “self-harm” practice. Drawing on Michel Foucault’s (1978) comparison of scientia sexualis and ars erotica, I argue that one way to expand <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> and being sexual is by focusing less on the science of sexual desire {{and more on the}} art of exploring bodily pleasure. Using Naomi’s narrative, I propose an alternative way to celebrate gender, sexuality, and pleasure beyond specifying and categorising sexual identities, that is, by giving new meaning to the practice of “self-harm. ...|$|E

40|$|This piece {{takes up}} Beauregard’s (1989) {{challenge}} to view planning theory {{through the lens}} of postmodern critique. It is argued here that we need to broaden the planning theory literature to include the works of feminists and people of color who are addressing the condition of postmodernity in constructive and progressive ways, within a revised radical democratic tradition. The writings of bell hooks, Gloria Anzaldua, Cornel West, and others are a challenge to our theory and practice, and therefore to planning education. I discuss their contributions to such problems as <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing, <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> acting, and <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> being, and suggest that they are addressing both what is wrong with our cities and with <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> the world...|$|R

40|$|These Aesthetics Are Not New draws {{inspiration}} from the effect of digital technological progress on a consumer society. The Internet {{as a source of}} ubiquitous imagery reaffirms the idea that in a Post-Internet age there is nothing new, only conditions affected by a networked way of life. In this thesis I attempt to question contemporary ideas of representation and art making, specifically within the medium of oil paint, in a digitally consumed culture of instantaneous access. I interrogate the repetitive imagery that pervades our online experiences, and I speak about how I use my grasp of painterly knowledge and lexicon to replicate digital conditions in the real world to further cement my position that contemporary aesthetics, (digital, physical or both) are not new. I first introduce the reader to the idea of the Post-Internet, exploring the digital’s encroachment on our physical spaces and it’s relation to the politics of the medium of Oil Paint. I then address the concept of the Image-Object, and unpack this idea by comparing and contrasting emoji’s in relation to gestural mark making and the ascription of meaning through iconographic methods in Oil Painting. This culminates in an analysis of my physical practice in relation to these ideas, and concludes with my observations on the future of <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing,</b> as affected by the Internet and technological progression...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the consequential nature of communication, literacy and citizenship and the meta-pattern that connects everything together – {{the ecology of}} the human spirit. It argues that, just like human communication, literacy is consequential in nature for humankind. Through each of our different worlds of experience and processes of communication, we manifest both of these human conditions and co-construct everyday practices that engender a plurality of effects. Literacy is a concept common to all humankind. Thus, it forms an indivisible whole with communication. This viewpoint is at odds with that which confines literacy to being understood as the acquisition of certain competences. It is arguable that, just like communication, the human condition of literacy needs to be both encouraged and developed. We suggest here that the idea of borders in literacy should be questioned. The work of Gregory Bateson on {{the ecology of the}} human spirit – an imminent characteristic of the human species that is based on the physiological structure of the living being and is in permanent interaction and reconnection with both the biosphere and <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> the world – supports the viewpoint put forward here. From the communication mediatised by a children’s television channel, from SIC K and from the results of studies carried out into children’s use of television we draw the examples that shall illustrate the theoretical approach taken here. They also underpin two premises of an ongoing project. Firstly, television is part of the solution in that it encourages and develops communication-literacy- citizenship-education-connectivity. Secondly, human rights form a shared platform from which to orient the use of Technologies and define connection strategies for the active participation of the children...|$|E
40|$|Interview with Julian Ross for Sonic Acts Festival 2015, The Geologic Imagination. Born in Iraq, London-based artist Jananne Al-Ani {{engages with}} the {{politics}} of the image. In her works in photography, film and video, Al-Ani interrogates <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> by undermining the structures of scale and perspective in which visual culture is shaped. While her conceptual application is subversive, her methods are gentle, often resulting in evocations of assumptions which are quietly unsettled. In her work in the 1990 s and early 2000 s, her central subject was the Western portrayal of the Middle East, in particular, women and the veil. Working closely with her immediate family, her works undercut media-fuelled perceptions of ‘other’ cultures with personal narratives and playful mind-games. Shifting away from the human body as an image to the human imprint, her recent series The Aesthetics of Disappearance: A Land Without People illustrates Al-Ani’s preoccupation with the ways in which history is etched into the landscape. Bold in technique yet comparatively subtle in effect, her films Shadow Sites I (2010) and Shadow Sites II (2011) capture the desert landscape of the Middle East. What appears to be an uninhabitable landscape is revealed to be a home for industrial farms and abandoned military training camps. Playing with the visual codes of modern warfare, the remnants of structures spread out over the land and speak of untold histories of human activity. Presented at the 2015 edition of Sonic Acts curated under the theme of ‘The Geologic Imagination’, the two films shown together drove home the misconception of the border between nature and humanity, a theme that spanned across the works presented in the festival. Film programmer and researcher Julian Ross took the opportunity to interview Jananne Al-Ani during her visit to Sonic Acts where she presented her recent series...|$|E

Aqui, sob os relatos dos modos de fabricação e circulação da lomografia, pudemos adentrar estas redes de mediações sociotécnicas que desenham sua prática, bem como perceber o modo como construímos, no presente, a história das imagens nesse contexto. Já sob a diversidade de elementos que hoje reordenam nossas formas de ver, junto à noção de anacronismo (AGAMBEN, 2009; BENJAMIN; 1994; DIDI-HUBERMAN, 2010; RANCIÈRE, 2012), este gesto cartográfico nos levou tanto a buscar aspecto relacional e comunicativo da imagem lomo, quando a compreender a construção deste sentido visual frente à montagem de tempos heterogêneos.

40|$|At a time when, arguably {{more than}} ever before in human history, the human mind needs to become more adaptive, and adapting, to meet the {{increasingly}} complex, ambiguous, uncertain conditions {{of the world in which}} we live, any practices that can effect lasting expansion of <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing,</b> thinking and acting in relation to self, others, and the world may be considered a useful and valuable contribution to human knowledge and practices. This practice-led research conducted over a span of eight years demonstrates the capacity of an arts-based system of knowing and knowledge production to give rise to just such effects. Creative contemplation® is a methodology of material meditation originated and evolved within an experimental, transdisciplinary, commercial design practice - a methodology that proves able to generate self-reflexive spaces for myself, and for others who are neither trained nor practised in creative arts, and it is able to do so within the context of everyday practices. This bricolage system of knowing and knowledge production primarily derives from the arts but also variously derives from Australian Indigenous cultural practices as well as psychology, somatic therapy, Western and Eastern philosophy, and traditions of meditation - most particularly Japanese forms of Zen. As such, the transdisciplinary nature of Creative contemplation® accesses and activates a continuum of somatic and intellectual ways of knowing that at once both transcend and extend habitual ontological and epistemological frameworks. This investigation draws on the experience and knowledge gained in a highly successful, five year collaboration with a courageous organisation that risks engaging me to create and conduct extensive learning fora in which Creative contemplation® is used to increase individual and collective capacity of environmental scientists, and other staff, grappling with the complex matter of sustainability, and the uncertain future of the natural environment and humanity’s prospect inextricably interwoven within it. In situating my work in relation to the orthodoxy of investigating and cultivating mind in the area of business known as organisational learning and development, and in relation to the emerging field of arts in business, its significant contribution to knowledge and practices in this arena come clearly into view, but, by its very nature, such transdisciplinary practice-research transcends boundaries of any single field allowing contributions to knowledge and practices to be far more broadly inferred. Through studio inquiry, and practice-led and literature-based research the philosophical, theoretical, methodological and practical frameworks are created that support, and make explicit, the ontology and operations of Creative contemplation® methodology, the learning fora with others that I conceive as a species of performative installation, and my agency and role as practitioner within these fora that I cast as being (an) Attendant - a specialised model and mode of facilitation commensurate with the potency of arts-based knowing to investigate and cultivate workings of mind and heart...|$|E

A sound grounding of philosophical concepts improves <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> ourselves, others and our environment. Because actions follows knowledge, proper knowledge of what we are and what we are meant to do, improves our actions, for our own and others benefit. The reports included in this sampler have been modified to preserve the privacy of the authors. Except for names and companies, the rest are «real life» situations, perceptions, actitudes and behaviours. The purpose of this sampler is to help each one of us to «budget our life» seeing how our colleagues do it. For those who want to try I have included the instructions given to the students for the project. The results of these projects are not the consequence of one subject, or one lecturer, but of the sum of efforts of the students themselves, many lecturers, mentors and other personnel who remain, as the authors, anonimous in the background, for example the project methodology was developed by Ms. C.

40|$|This paper {{address the}} current trends of two key {{features}} in adult learning: {{the ability to}} critically reflect on our own experiences, and to incorporate knowledge gained by learning through doing. Critical reflections appeal as an adult learning strategy lies in the claim of intellectual growth and improvement in one's own ability to see the need for, and to effect personal system change. Assumptions structure <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> reality, govern <b>our</b> behaviour and describe how relationships should be ordered. A number of educators assert assumption analysis to be {{a first step in}} the critical reflection process and ask if it can be taught in a classroom. Quality teaching and self- analysis are the keys to dynamic and beneficial development in learners. Research has identified characteristics of quality teaching with some indicators more easily measured than others. In a similar <b>way,</b> strategies <b>of</b> self analysis can be identified, organised as a hierarchical and continuous process, and when followed, would result in self-development. The experiential learning process involves undertaking an activity, analysing what was learnt through that activity, which, in turn, facilitates the application of this learning to other areas of our lives. Deep learning, achieved through reflection upon everyday experiences, {{can be seen as the}} most effective. It is apparent that the challenge for adult educators is knowing how to bridge the changeover from classroom to practice. This paper is a response to the current theoretical frameworks, which model many of the strategies that educators have identified for maximising strengths, minimising weaknesses and achieving desired goals...|$|R
40|$|Much of our {{experiences}} {{in the world can}} be mediated through art and artistic expression. Art is inherently political and, as such, is able to call up the interests, attitudes and experiences of particular groups in ways that illumi-nate these redities for all to see and experience. It can forge a relationship between the social, political and cultural domains <b>of</b> <b>our</b> world in <b>ways</b> that can greatly influence <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing,</b> knowing and experiencing. Art is acts and actions that are able to confront and act out particular redities in ways that illuminate certain messages, particular allusions andlor dole out real warnings (Krukowski, 1992). When we dare to integrate art into the curriculum, we provide a means by which others can decode and re-code expression to forge connections between discursive social practices and language and the aesthetic symbolization of experience and knowledge. <b>Ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing the world through the practice and pleasure of the arts could make us more observant, wiser and more aware of the world around us. Since the content and creation of forms of art are specific to the location and social nexus of its affiliation, it helps us to draw the peculiarities between ideas, thoughts and experiences and express <b>our</b> knowl-edge in <b>ways</b> that help illuminate the nature of social life and build upon personal strength. It is also communal and depicts the evolution of selfwithin the design of the group in which it resides.

To achieve this objective I use autobiographies, stories, reflections and poems etc. as narratives with multiple logics and genres; pictography as art-based expression; and ethnography as methodological space within multiparadigmatic design space. In so doing autoethnographer has to delve into whole process of research along a continuum of self and beyond within a particular sociocultural context to understand the phenomena at deeper level of consciousness. This transformative paradigm holds a strong basis in the process of research as: re/reading, re/viewing, critically reflecting on self/others, re/writing for meaning making and developing a subjective understanding of phenomena under exploration. This process of research is found to be an innovative <b>way</b> <b>of</b> knowing through ‘interpreting and constructing (Luitel, 2009) within Interpretivism, critically thinking and reflecting within Criticalism, and adding both ‘pluralism and playfulness’ (Taylor, 2013) within Postmodernism.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In some contexts, a {{photograph}} {{may be worth}} a thousand words. Previous research revealed a dialectical character of photo-graphs: they simultaneously lack determinacy and exhibit an excess of meaning. The {{purpose of this study}} was to understand how, under this condition, high school students interpret photographs that were accom-panied by different amounts and types of co-text (caption, main text). The data for this study consists of video-recorded interviews with twelve Brazilian high school students. What students perceived was in part a function of the presence of caption and main text; these texts not only de-scribed what could be seen but also taught students how to look at pho-tographs. We conclude that high school students not only need to develop subject matter literacy but also a literacy concerning photographs to fully understand their textbooks. Every image embodies a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing.</b> Even {{a photograph}}. For photo-graphs are not, as is often assumed, a mechanical record. Every time we look at a photograph, we are aware, however slightly, of the photogra-pher selecting that sight from an infinity of other possible sights.

The photographer’s <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> is reflected in his choice of subject. … Yet, although every image embodies a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing,</b> <b>our</b> perception or appreciation of an image de-pends also upon <b>our</b> own <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing.</b> (Berger, 1972, p. 10) We live in a visual world.

40|$|Nicholas Rescher {{writes that}} “objectivity is not {{something}} we infer from the data; it is something we must presuppose. It is something that we postulate or presume from the very outset of our dealings with people’s claims about the world’s facts”. Such definition is just the opposite of objectivity conceived of in classical terms, but it cannot be equated with an idealistic viewpoint according to which objectivity is something that our mind simply creates in the process of reflection. It is, rather, a sort of cross-product of the encounter between our mind-shaped capacities, and a surrounding reality made up of things that are real in the usual meaning of the term. Science itself gives us some crucial insights in this direction, since it shows that we see, say, tables and trees in a certain way which, however, does not match the image that scientific instruments are able to attain. Does this mean that our commonsense view of the world is totally wrong and that nature deceives us? This is not the case. The difference between the commonsense and the scientific image of the world is explainable by {{the fact that we are}} evolutionary creatures. Nature has simply endowed human beings with tools and capacities that enable them to survive in an environment which - at least in remote eras - was largely hostile. <b>Our</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> tables and trees is what is requested for carrying on a successful fight for the survival of the species: nothing more - and nothing less - is needed for achieving this fundamental goal. Turning once again to the problem of ontological objectivity, the picture has now gained both strength and clarity. If we recall that human endeavors, although occurring in a largely autonomous social and linguistic world, are nevertheless limited by the constraints that natural reality forces upon us, we begin to understand that the social-linguistic world itself is not a boat freely floating without directions. If the boat is there, it means that an explanation of its presence is likely to be obtained if only we are patient enough to look for it. Some kind of hand must be on the wheel, giving the boat indications on Contrary to other pragmatist-flavored positions popular nowadays, this approach maintains that universality has a fundamental and unavoidable function in our rational endeavors. This is due to the fact that “presupposition” and “hypothetical reasoning” are key ingredients of our very capacity to rationalize the world in which we live. Indeed, there can be no rationality without universality...|$|R

40|$|Throughout history, utopian ideals {{have existed}} {{promoting}} {{nature as a}} necessary affect for better aesthetic and psychological being. Yet, as human populations climb so do stresses upon the natural environment – therefore, bringing “the city in harmony with nature” becomes more challenging. Fortunately, hope exists {{through the use of}} greenroof technology. Greenroofs are a green space created by continuous layers of drainage, protection, growing medium, and plants either onto or integral to a roofing system. This paper explores extensive greenroofs, characterized by low-maintenance and shallow growing medium. Greenroof benefits (ecological, economical, aesthetic, psychological) are classified as: Market and Human. Further exploration of human-driven benefits result in the definitions of active and passive sensation (the division of sensation) : Active sensation is the immediate, present, unimagined engagement of a specific sense. Passive sensation is the imagined perception (sensing) of an object or element. As defined, Active Sensations are real and, therefore, have limits/defects/boundaries; yet, Passive Sensations are imagined, and therefore, limitless. As alluded by William James, “The philosophy which is so important in each of us is not a technical matter; it is our more or less dumb sense of what life honestly and deeply means. It is only partly got from books; it is <b>our</b> individual <b>way</b> <b>of</b> just <b>seeing</b> and feeling the total push and pressure of the cosmos. ” The remainder of the document explores human-driven greenroof design; emphasizing design as a form of inquiry. ii...|$|R

Their original concept was for an album of songs about the relationship and conflicting ideals between Davies and Hodgson themselves, to be titled Hello Stranger.
