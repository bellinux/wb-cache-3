40|$|ABSTRACT—New field {{collections}} {{allow the}} study and description of Valvata juliae new species from the Pliocene upper Burgi Member of the Koobi Fora Formation of Kenya. The shell morphology of this species varies from trochospiral to planispiral to <b>open</b> <b>coiled.</b> The species is restricted to a short stratigraphic interval. Valvata juliae is considered as an invader of the Turkana Basin during a lacustrine transgression event. The <b>open</b> <b>coiling</b> of the species is interpreted as an ecophenotypic response to {{a high level of}} environmental stress caused by lake level fluctuations and emergence of delta systems. These environmental conditions brought Valvata juliae to extinction soon after it invaded the Turkana Basin...|$|R
50|$|In general, {{based on}} the application, a {{pneumatic}} cylinder is usually a single acting cylinder, {{where there is a}} single port in the cylinder and were cylinder extension is done by compressed air and retraction by means of <b>open</b> <b>coiled</b> spring.

40|$|The study {{represents}} {{new approach}} to design helical coil spring. Response surface modeling and analysis of <b>open</b> <b>coiled</b> helical spring by considering longitudinal and invariance have been carried out. Design parameters are wire diameter, spring diameter, height, number of turns elastic modulus in X and Z direction, poissions ratio, force. Simple equations is proposed which gives value of compressive stress of helical coil spring by carrying out regression analysis. It is observed that force and material property are significant parameters which affect compressive stress because their P value is 1. Relationship among design parameters and compressive stress has been obtained...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to present a new upper molar distalization {{appliance}} called Cise distalizer designed as intraoral device supported with orthodontic mini screw for upper permanent molar distalization. The new appliance consists of eight main components. In order to understand the optimum force level, the appliance under static loading is tested by using strain gage measurement techniques. Results show that one of the <b>open</b> <b>coils</b> produces approximately 300 [*]gr distalization force. Cise distalizer can provide totally 600 [*]gr distalization force. This range of force level is enough for distalization of upper first and second molar teeth...|$|R

Low rate <b>open</b> <b>coil</b> springs sat within pairs of triangulated wishbones holding the front wheels at their outer point. The upper wishbones acted on a piston-type hydraulic damper, the arms at the bottom were set wide apart so that the rearward one could act as a torque member under braking.

5000|$|Deming {{continually}} emphasized iterating {{towards an}} improved system, hence PDCA should be repeatedly implemented in spirals of increasing {{knowledge of the}} system that converge on the ultimate goal, each cycle closer than the previous. One can envision an <b>open</b> <b>coil</b> spring, with each loop being one cycle of the scientific method - PDCA, and each complete cycle indicating an increase in our knowledge of the system under study. This approach is {{based on the belief that}} our knowledge and skills are limited, but improving. Especially at the start of a project, key information may not be known; the PDCA—scientific method—provides feedback to justify our guesses (hypotheses) and increase our knowledge. Rather than enter [...] "analysis paralysis" [...] to get it perfect the first time, it is better to be approximately right than exactly wrong. With the improved knowledge, we may choose to refine or alter the goal (ideal state). Certainly, the PDCA approach can bring us closer to whatever goal we choose.|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} to the conventional telescopic fork type front suspension used in bicycles is the Floating handle bar suspension which replaces the two springs {{that are used in}} the Telescopic forks by a single <b>open</b> <b>coiled</b> spring of a greater wire diameter and stiffness thereby eliminating the need of telescopic forks. In our study we determine the spring that is to be used to produce the required suspension effect. The newly designed spring was integrated to the bicycle and the model was validated by a working prototype which was ridden to check for any failures. The bicycle model used for checking the effectiveness of floating handlebar suspension was a Hercules Terminator V 2. One major problem that we faced was the maneuverability of the bicycle during hard turns. This was due to the increase in weight of the front suspension...|$|R
50|$|The shell-dwelling species' {{needs are}} very similar. The basic {{aquarium}} setup and equipment are appropriate {{with a few}} changes. First, the substrate should be sand. Many of the species are very accomplished diggers and for security may bury {{all or part of}} a shell, use sand as a territorial barrier, or generally amuse the owner by spitting, sifting, or throwing it. Second, hard, alkaline water must be provided, which should also be kept free of ammonia and nitrites and with low nitrates. Finally, appropriate shells must be provided. Common shells used for shell dwellers include authentic Neothauma shells, ocean turbo shells, escargot shells, whale eye shells, and Ampullariidae-family shells. Shells must be of an appropriate size for the species, have a round opening, and have <b>open</b> <b>coils.</b> Numbers of shells will vary; for colonial species, hundreds may be ideal. For brevis types, a single shell per pair is often representative.|$|R

5000|$|A more crude {{search coil}} also called {{exploring}} coil {{is also used}} in laboratory experiments in schools to measure the magnetic field in a certain region of space. In this case the search coil consists of a simple wire coil or solenoid connected to a sensitive ammeter or galvanometer. The coil {{is placed in the}} magnetic field to be measured and quickly withdrawn to a region of space with a negligible magnetic field. As the search coil moves the magnetic flux linked with the coil changes. This induces a current in the coil which can be registered on the galvanometer. Since induced current is directly proportional to rate of change of flux linkage and assuming the coil is removed from the magnetic field very quickly, the maximum current measured by the ammeter is proportional to the magnetic field [...] The search coil can be calibrated by repeating this in a known magnetic field.A reference table shows <b>open</b> <b>coil</b> voltage versus magnetic field A/m (or teslas) or short current versus magnetic field.|$|E
40|$|<b>Open</b> <b>coil</b> springs {{are used}} {{commonly}} to create {{space for a}} buccally or lingually/palatally blocked out a tooth. However, as space opens up the <b>open</b> <b>coil</b> spring loosens most of its activation and thus requires reactivation. Various techniques {{have been developed to}} re-activate the <b>open</b> <b>coil</b> spring without removing the base archwire. While reactivating the <b>open</b> <b>coil</b> spring has to be compressed towards one side using wire tucker or with the tip of the finger, thus making the procedure very cumbersome for the clinician.

40|$|The late Llandovery graptolite fauna of the Retiolites Shales on Kinnekulle Mountain in the {{province}} of Västergötland has long been known but never illustrated or studied in detail. New collections of graptolites from an interval {{at the very top of}} the exposed succession confirm previous reports of cyrtograptids, which make the shales on Kinnekulle the youngest preserved Palaeozoic rocks in the area. The co-occurrence of Oktavites spiralis and Cyrtograptus lapworthi constrains the strata to the lower lapworthi Biozone of the upper Telychian. The associated graptolite fauna comprises numerous monograptids and Retiolites angustidens as well as Cyrtograptus kinnekullensis n. sp., characterised by its <b>open</b> <b>coiling</b> and the presence of a second-order cladium on the second thecal cladium. This early occurrence of a cyrtograptid species with a second-order cladium on Baltica matches evolutionary patterns observed in Laurentia, suggesting that the ability to grow cladia of both first and higher order evolved approximately, synchronously and at the very beginning of cyrtograptid evolution...|$|R
40|$|Radio-frequency (RF) coils are a {{necessary}} component of {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) systems. When used in transmit operation, they act to generate a homogeneous RF magnetic field within a volume of interest and when in receive operation, they act to receive the nuclear magnetic resonance signal from the RF-excited specimen. This paper outlines a procedure {{for the design of}} <b>open</b> RF <b>coils</b> using the time-harmonic inverse method. This method entails the calculation of an ideal current density on a multipaned planar surface that would generate a specified magnetic field within the volume of interest. Because of the averaging effect of the regularization technique in the matrix solution, the specified magnetic field is shaped within an iterative procedure until the generated magnetic field matches the desired magnetic field. The stream-function technique is used to ascertain conductor positions and a method of moments package is then used to finalize the design. An <b>open</b> head/neck <b>coil</b> was designed to operate in a clinical 2 T MRI system and the presented results prove the efficacy of this design methodology...|$|R

In such situations, the clinician needs to remove the arch wire and reinserts a longer coil spring. A new simple and cost-effective technique describes an intraoral reactivation of an <b>open</b> <b>coil</b> spring without the need for removal of the base archwire with the additional benefit of preventing unwanted forces to the adjacent teeth...|$|E

40|$|We study numerically a {{lattice model}} of semiflexible homopolymers with nearest {{neighbor}} attraction and energetic preference for straight joints between bonded monomers. For this {{we use a}} new algorithm, the "Pruned-Enriched Rosenbluth Method" (PERM). It is very efficient both for relatively open configurations at high temperatures and for compact and frozen-in low-T states. This allows us to study in detail the phase diagram {{as a function of}} nn-attraction epsilon and stiffness x. It shows a theta-collapse line with a transition from <b>open</b> <b>coils</b> to molten compact globules (large epsilon) and a freezing transition toward a state with orientational global order (large stiffness x). Qualitatively this is similar to a recently studied mean field theory (Doniach et al. (1996), J. Chem. Phys. 105, 1601), but there are important differences. In contrast to the mean field theory, the theta-temperature increases with stiffness x. The freezing temperature increases even faster, and reaches the theta-line at a finite value of x. For even stiffer chains, the freezing transition takes place directly without the formation of an intermediate globule state. Although being in contrast with mean filed theory, the latter has been conjectured already by Doniach et al. on the basis of low statistics Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the present model as a very crude model for protein folding. Comment: 11 pages, Latex, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the influence of fluoride and stress on the mechanical properties of nickel-titanium <b>open</b> <b>coil</b> springs. Materials and Methods: Sentalloy nickel-titanium <b>open</b> <b>coil</b> springs (15 mm length) were divided into five groups. A control group was tested mechanically in as-received condition. The other four experimental groups were exposed to artificial saliva (Fusayama-Meyer solution) at 37 oC for 12 weeks in a 2 x 2 factorial design with fluoride exposure and stress (compression) as the two factors. Those springs which were under compression were held at 5 mm in length for the entirety of the testing period. Fluoride exposure was two minutes per day in a 1500 ppm NaF solution. In each group, n= 10. The experimental groups were then tested mechanically via compression on a universal testing machine following the 12 -week exposure period to measure force characteristics. Results: No significant differences in activation force were seen between the coil groups, whereas significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) differences were observed in deactivation forces between the control and compressed/fluoride group and also between the control and the non-compressed/non-fluoride group. Ranges of mean deactivation force values between all groups were less than only 6 and 14 grams of force at 4 mm and 8 mm respectively. Conclusions: Clinically relevant daily fluoride exposure (1500 ppm) and continuous compression for twelve weeks did not result in clinically significant changes in force values of the nickel-titanium <b>open</b> <b>coil</b> springs, indicating they are likely to deliver consistent forces during the course of treatment...|$|E
