Her increasing alcohol consumption, combined with her medication, {{was said to have}} contributed to her violent outburst in 2008.|$|E

25|$|The {{diversification}} in Queens' {{economy is}} reflected in the large amount of employment in the export-oriented portions of its economy—such as transportation, manufacturing, and business services—that serve customers outside the region.

25|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, {{one of the}} major causes of {{migration}} from North Dakota is the lack of skilled jobs for college graduates. Expansion of economic development programs has been urged to create skilled and high-tech jobs, but the effectiveness of such programs has been open to debate. During {{the first decade of the}} 21st century, the population increased in large part because <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oil industry related to development of shale-oil fields.|$|E

25|$|The rise of Beaumont's mill economy drew {{many new}} {{residents}} to the city, {{many of them}} immigrants.

By the early 20th century, the city was served by the Southern Pacific; Kansas City Southern, Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe; and Missouri Pacific railroad systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of huge oil fields in western Canada {{starting with the}} Leduc, Alberta field in 1947, and growing imports of cheap foreign oil into eastern Canada drastically affected the demand for Canadian coal. Beginning about 1950, almost all the coal used for heating, industry, and transportation was replaced by petroleum products and natural gas. This had a devastating effect on the coal mining communities of Atlantic Canada, although in western Canada the loss <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coal industry was more than compensated for by gains in the oil industry.|$|E

25|$|For {{decades the}} Census Bureau had been {{reporting}} a steady {{decline in the}} city's population as residents moved out to new suburbs in the postwar years, aided by newly built highways. In addition, industrial restructuring cost a loss <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 20th century. But, according to the Census Bureau's 2006 estimates, the population was 332,252, representing a slight increase from 331,310 in 2005. The city had officially challenged the original census numbers. In addition, Mayor Mark Mallory has repeatedly argued that the city's population is 378,259, after a drill-down study was performed by an independent, non-profit group based in Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|The {{quantity}} and quality <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cigar industry would continue to fall as Tampa's manufacturers underwent a near-universal shift to mechanization. Replacing traditional hand-rolled cigars with machine-made varieties allowed cigar firms to employ fewer workers and pay them less. Even when demand quickly increased to record levels during American's post-war boom, {{the number of workers}} employed in Ybor City's factories continued to decrease due to more efficient machines. By then, Tampa's economy was buoyed by other industries such as shipping and tourism. However, little new activity had replaced cigar manufacturing in Ybor City, and job seekers often had to look elsewhere for employment.|$|E

25|$|The {{county has}} a mixed economy. An {{important}} part of the economy is based on tourism: many visitors are attracted by the many beaches and the mountains. A significant part of the county lies within the Snowdonia National Park, which extends from the north coast down to the district of Merioneth in the south; it is much larger than Snowdonia proper. But tourism provides seasonal employment and thus there is a shortage <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter. Another problem with tourism is the demand that it creates for second homes. This pushes house prices out of reach of local people, {{to the detriment of the}} position of the Welsh language in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|The text {{prepared}} by Ambedkar provided constitutional guarantees and protections {{for a wide}} range of civil liberties for individual citizens, including freedom of religion, the abolition of untouchability, and the outlawing of all forms of discrimination. Ambedkar argued for extensive economic and social rights for women, and won the Assembly's support for introducing a system of reservations <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> civil services, schools and colleges for members of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and Other Backward Class, a system akin to affirmative action. India's lawmakers hoped to eradicate the socio-economic inequalities and lack of opportunities for India's depressed classes through these measures. The Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949 by the Constituent Assembly.|$|E

The number <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Information sector has been growing at annual rates above 50%.
