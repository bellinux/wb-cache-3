Helmholtz also noted that there was evidence of <b>oscillation</b> from the electrolysis experiments of William Hyde Wollaston. Wollaston was attempting to decompose water by electric shock but found that both hydrogen and oxygen were present at both electrodes. In normal electrolysis they would separate, one to each electrode.|$|E
5|$|The {{number and}} {{strength}} of Atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 50–70 year cycle, {{also known as the}} Atlantic Multidecadal <b>Oscillation.</b> Nyberg et al. reconstructed Atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early 18th century and found five periods averaging 3–5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 40–60 years, and six other averaging 1.5–2.5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 10–20 years. These periods are associated with the Atlantic multidecadal <b>oscillation.</b> Throughout, a decadal <b>oscillation</b> related to solar irradiance was responsible for enhancing/dampening the number of major hurricanes by 1–2 per year.|$|E
5|$|The term rear wobble {{is used to}} {{describe}} a mode of <b>oscillation</b> in which lean angle (roll) and heading angle (yaw) are almost in phase and both 180° out of phase with steer angle.

30|$|One of {{the major}} threats to the {{security}} and stability of power systems is low-frequency <b>oscillations</b> [1, 2]. If <b>oscillations</b> are negatively damped, the magnitude of <b>oscillations</b> will grow and consequently cause system breakup and power outages. These are known as the small signal stability problems. Analysis of low-frequency <b>oscillations</b> is critical to the reliable operation of power systems. Based on the cause of <b>oscillations,</b> low-frequency electromechanical <b>oscillations</b> can be categorized into two main categories: free <b>oscillations</b> and forced <b>oscillations.</b> Free <b>oscillations</b> result from the natural interaction among dynamic devices. In contrast, forced <b>oscillations</b> refer to system responses to an external periodic perturbation.|$|R
30|$|Methods to {{mitigate}} the free <b>oscillations</b> are totally different than those for forced <b>oscillations.</b> Power system stabilizer (PSS) is a simple and economical method to suppress the <b>oscillations</b> by increasing the damping ratio. Control strategies can be utilized to rectify lightly-damped or undamped free <b>oscillations.</b> In contrast, removing the source of <b>oscillations</b> {{can be considered a}} remedy for forced <b>oscillations.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Oscillations</b> {{classification}} is {{very important}} to the reliable operation of power systems because control strategy for suppressing different types of <b>oscillations</b> can be significantly different. Using support vector machine (SVM), [33] proposed a method that can classify two different types of <b>oscillations</b> based on feature extraction. Basically, increasing amplitude of free <b>oscillations</b> is used to distinguish it from forced <b>oscillations.</b> In this case, algorithm accuracy has direct relationship with envelope size. Thus, there is a question of whether this algorithm can work in real-time scenarios. Reference [34] proposed unique mathematical models for forced and free <b>oscillations.</b> In addition, they showed that the responses of the system to forced <b>oscillations</b> differs from those of free <b>oscillations.</b> Based on noise response and harmonic nature of <b>oscillations,</b> the authors proposed a method to distinguish forced <b>oscillations</b> from free <b>oscillations.</b> However, there is question of how to separate the pure sinusoid from noise in both cases (free and forced <b>oscillations)</b> and the effects of this separation on algorithm accuracy should be considered. In addition, it is important to evaluate the performance of proposed method when forced <b>oscillations</b> exist at a system’s mode frequency.|$|R

5|$|In general, {{westerly}} wind increases {{associated with}} the Madden–Julian <b>oscillation</b> lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all tropical cyclone basins. As the <b>oscillation</b> propagates from west to east, it leads to an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemisphere's summer season. On average, twice per year twin tropical cyclones will form in the western Pacific Ocean, near the 5th parallel north and the 5th parallel south, along the same meridian, or line of longitude. There is an inverse relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western Pacific basin and the north Atlantic basin, however. When one basin is active, the other is normally quiet, and vice versa. The main reason for {{this appears to be}} the phase of the Madden–Julian <b>oscillation,</b> or MJO, which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time.|$|E

5|$|The North Atlantic <b>oscillation</b> is an {{atmospheric}} phenomenon {{affecting the}} weather in Western Europe. When the atmospheric pressure variations in the North Atlantic are large, the springs in Europe are warmer. This brings forward the northward migration of those bird species (including the goldcrest) that winter mainly within western or southern Europe. A general climatic change resulting in more frequent positive North Atlantic <b>oscillation</b> events has led to earlier spring migration of these short-distance migrants since the 1980s. The warmer spring weather brings on plant growth, thus preparing the habitat for returning migrants. The effect is greatest in western and central Europe.|$|E

5|$|After {{three seasons}} of below average cyclone activity, the 2002–03 season was {{slightly}} above average, featuring ten cyclones and seven severe tropical cyclones. One of the cyclones, Cyclone Erica, originated from the Australian region but later {{moved into the}} South Pacific, where it impacted New Caledonia. Throughout the season, a moderately warm El Niño–Southern <b>Oscillation</b> (ENSO) generated a shift of cyclone activity away from Australia and towards the open waters of the southern Pacific. As a result, the Southern <b>Oscillation</b> Index (SOI) between November 2002 and June 2003 was negative, averaging -7.2. Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Pacific were above average; {{for most of the}} tropical regions, SSTs were above 29°C (84°C). At various times, Madden–Julian <b>oscillation</b> (MJO) pulses increased convective activity and thus cyclone development in the basin. Five pulses of the MJO and Equatorial Rossby waves (ER) were responsible for most of the cyclone activity during the season. Cyclone Zoe, the strongest cyclone of the season, was the only cyclone with no connection to any identified MJO or ER wave. By April, an easterly trade wind anomaly took place, signifying the end of the El Niño pattern that had persisted for much of the year.|$|E
