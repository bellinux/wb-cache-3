5|$|The {{geographic}} {{origin of}} the <b>onion</b> <b>is</b> uncertain because the wild <b>onion</b> <b>is</b> extinct and ancient records of using onions span western and eastern Asia. The first cultivated, farmed onions {{are the subject of}} much debate, but the two regions that many archaeologists, botanists, and food historians will point to are central Asia or Persia. They were probably simultaneously domesticated by peoples all over the world, as there are species of the onion found the world over. Food uses of onions date back thousands of years in China, Egypt and Persia.|$|E

Depending on the mature {{size and the}} purpose for which the <b>onion</b> <b>is</b> used, these may be {{referred}} to as pearl, boiler, or pickler onions, but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species. Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a long-lasting relish.|$|E
5|$|The {{triploid}} <b>onion</b> <b>is</b> {{a hybrid}} species with {{three sets of}} chromosomes, two sets from A. cepa and the third set from an unknown parent. Various clones of the triploid onion are grown locally in different regions, such as 'Ljutika' in Croatia, and 'Pran', 'Poonch', and 'Srinagar' in the India-Kashmir region. 'Pran' is grown extensively in the northern Indian provinces of Jammu and Kashmir. There are very small genetic differences between 'Pran' and the Croatian clone 'Ljutika', implying a monophyletic origin for this species.|$|E
5|$|I'itoi <b>onion</b> <b>is</b> a {{prolific}} multiplier onion cultivated in the Baboquivari Peak Wilderness, Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and {{is easy to}} grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1in below the surface and 12in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back {{in the heat of}} summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.|$|E
