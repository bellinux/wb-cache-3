Because of this, the Ontario Provincial Police claim that the road is the most often closed in the province.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{claim to}} the land {{was made by the}} Doeg. Later the Lee family of Virginia owned the land from 1725 to 1839. Richard Bland Lee did not build the main house until 1794. Following the purchase by William Swartwort in 1838, Sully was used as a home, a working farm, or both by a series of private owners. Then in 1958, Sully was acquired by the federal government {{as a part of the}} area to be used for the construction of Dulles Airport.

25|$|The Matterhorn is an {{isolated}} mountain. Because of {{its position on}} the main Alpine watershed and its great height, the Matterhorn is exposed to rapid weather changes. In addition, the steep faces of the mountain and its isolated location make it prone to banner clouds formation, with the air flowing around the mountain producing condensation of the air <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lee</b> side and also creating vortices.|$|E
25|$|Other proa {{designers}} {{blur the}} lines between Atlantic and Pacific style proas. The Harryproa from Australia uses a long, thin hull to lee, and a short, fat hull, containing the cabin, to windward. This would normally be more like an Atlantic proa, but the rig is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lee</b> hull, leaving it technically a Pacific design. This and other similar proas place {{the bulk of the}} passenger accommodations on the ama, in an attempt to make the vaka as streamlined as possible, and put much of the mass in the lee side to provide a greater righting moment.|$|E
5|$|The crémant {{produced}} in the Languedoc is made according to the Méthode Traditionnelle - formerly known as méthode champenoise, the same method used to produce the Champagne, including a second fermentation in the bottle to encapture the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast - in the small villages around the town of Limoux. The wines are normally composed of 70% Mauzac and a 30% combination of Chardonnay and Chenin blanc. AOC regulations require a year of aging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lees.</b> <b>The</b> Blanquette de Limoux, when labelled méthode ancestrale, is composed entirely of Mauzac, undergoes only one fermentation and is aged approximately three months less <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lees</b> before <b>the</b> bottling, the actual date being determined by the moon's cycle.|$|R

Sterile zones, inside the main perimeter walls and the walls encircling the female division and outside the prison wall, were standard prison practice for surveillance and contribute to the austere character of the prison.|$|E
500|$|Virginians were {{reluctant}} to believe that greatly respected figures such as Washington and Franklin would be complicit in setting up a tyrannical system. [...] There were broad attacks on Mason; the New Haven Gazette suggested {{that he had not}} done much for his country during the war, in marked contrast to Washington. Oliver Ellsworth blamed the Virginia opposition <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lee</b> family, who had long had tensions with the Washington family, and on [...] "the madness of Mason". Tarter, in his American National Biography article on Mason, wrote that [...] "the rigidity of [...] views and his increasingly belligerent personality produced an intolerance and intemperance in his behavior that surprised and angered Madison, with whom he had worked closely {{at the beginning of the}} convention, and Washington, who privately condemned Mason's actions during the ratification struggle." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dry white wines: {{restricted}} to a yield of 60 hectolitres/hectare, these wines {{are characterized by}} their Sauvignon-like nose and vigorous flavours.

40|$|Yeast mannoproteins {{released}} {{during the}} process of aging wine <b>on</b> <b>the</b> yeast <b>lees</b> have been reported to make important contributions to wine quality. However, few mannoproteins have been identified in wine and their lifespan during aging is unknown. As a first step towards better understanding the contributions of yeast mannoproteins to wine quality, a model system was used to follow changes in yeast protein release, and to identify the released proteins over a 9 -month time course following completion of fermentation. Model musts were fermented in duplicate by a number of commercial yeast strains, including BM 45 and RC 212, and were stored <b>on</b> <b>the</b> yeast <b>lees</b> post-fermentation with monthly stirring at 15 °C. Wine samples were taken during and after fermentation, and following removal of suspended solids, total protein and total mannoproteins were measured, and individual proteins were identified—but not quantified—by HPLC-MS of tryptic fragments. The total number of identified proteins in all samples increased from between 3 - 15 following inoculation, to between 70 - 80 after one month <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lees,</b> and decreased to about 20 after 6 months <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lees.</b> Over 50 % of the identified protein...|$|R

Some wines (notably Chardonnay, Champagne and Muscadet) are sometimes aged for a time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lees</b> (a process known as sur lie), leading to a distinctive yeasty aroma and taste. <b>The</b> <b>lees</b> may be stirred (bâtonage in French) {{in order to promote}} uptake of the lees' flavour.|$|R
500|$|Lake-effect snow is {{produced}} in the winter {{in the shape of}} one or more elongated bands when cold winds move across long expanses of warmer lake water, providing energy and picking up water vapor which freezes and is deposited <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lee</b> shores. [...] The same effect over bodies of salt water is called ocean effect snow, sea effect snow, or even bay effect snow. [...] The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic effect of higher elevations on the downwind shores. [...] This uplifting can produce narrow, but very intense bands of precipitation, which is deposited at a rate of many inches of snow per hour and often brings copious snowfall totals. [...] The areas affected by lake-effect snow are called snowbelts. This effect occurs in many locations throughout the world, but is best known in the populated areas of the Great Lakes of North America.|$|E

In May 2004, the International Olympic Commission put London on the shortlist of potential locations for the Games, alongside Paris, Madrid, Moscow, and New York City; although Paris was widely expected to be the eventual victor, London would prove successful in its nomination. Another major development project was launched in February 2004 as the London Plan, in which Livingstone's administration laid out their intentions to deal with the city's major housing shortage by ensuring the construction of 30,000 new homes a year.
