40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we aimed to {{evaluate}} the relationship between individual <b>total</b> <b>exposure</b> to air pollution (AP) and airways changes {{in a group of}} 51 wheezing children. Respiratory status was assessed four times (January 2006, June 2006, January 2007, June 2007) during one week, through a standardized questionnaire, spirometry, FeNO and pH in EBC. Concentrations of PM 10, O 3, NO 2 and volatile organic compounds were estimated through direct measurements with an ad hoc device or AP modelling in the children's schools and at their homes in the same 4 weeks of the study. For each child, <b>total</b> <b>exposure</b> to the different air pollutants was estimated as a function of pollutants concentrations and daily activity patterns. Increasing <b>total</b> <b>exposure</b> to PM 10, NO 2, benzene, toluene and ethylbenzene was associated significantly with a decrease of FEV 1 and with an increase of ΔFEV 1. Increasing exposure to NO 2 and benzene was also related to a significant decrease of FEV 1 /FVC. Increasing exposure to PM 10, NO 2, benzene and ethylbenzene was associated with acidity of EBC.

40|$|It {{is evident}} from space flights {{during the last three}} years that the low Earth orbital (LEO) {{environment}} interacts with spacecraft surfaces in significant ways. One manifestation of these interactions is recession of, in particular, organic-polymer-based surfaces presumably due to oxidation by atomic oxygen, the major component of the LEO environment. Three experiments have been conducted on Space Shuttle flights 5, 8 and 41 -G to measure reaction rates and the effects of various parameters on reaction rates. Surface recession on these flights indicates reaction efficiencies approximately 3 x 10 (- 24) cu cm/atoms for unfilled organic polymers. Of the metals, silver and osmium are very reactive. Effects on spacecraft or experiment surfaces can be evaluated using the derived reaction efficiencies and a definition of the <b>total</b> <b>exposure</b> to atomic oxygen. This exposure is obtained using an ambient density model, solar activity data and spacecraft parameters of altitude, attitude and operational date. Oxygen flux on a given surface is obtained from the ambient density and spacecraft velocity and can then be integrated to provide the <b>total</b> <b>exposure</b> or fluence. Such information can be generated using simple computational programs and can be converted to various formats. Overall, the extent of damage is strongly dependent on the type of surface and <b>total</b> <b>exposure</b> time...|$|R
