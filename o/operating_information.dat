50|$|Railway costing is {{typically}} performed using mathematical models. Using unit costs from current operating data and current accounting and <b>operating</b> <b>information,</b> {{it is possible}} to develop costing information for the railway. This costing information may be used to estimate the operating cost of a new line and to determine whether it is economically viable. Alternatively, the model could be used to estimate the cost effects of changing speed limits along a route. The savings that can be achieved with a railway costing model are endless. For example, by knowing the costs of doing business, a railway can appropriately determine the tariffs to be charged.|$|E

5000|$|Many times chemists {{research}} {{chemical reactions}} or other chemical principles in a laboratory, commonly {{on a small}} scale in a [...] "batch-type" [...] experiment. Chemistry information obtained is then used by chemical engineers, along with expertise of their own, to convert to a chemical process and scale up the batch size or capacity. Commonly, a small chemical plant called a pilot plant is built to provide design and <b>operating</b> <b>information</b> before construction of a large plant. From data and operating experience obtained from the pilot plant, a scaled-up plant can be designed for higher or full capacity. After the fundamental aspects of a plant design are determined, mechanical or electrical engineers may become involved with mechanical or electrical details, respectively. Structural engineers may become involved in the plant design to ensure the structures can support the weight of the units, piping, and other equipment.|$|E
50|$|High-security alarm {{controls}} use {{current and}} impedance monitoring on the premises, and may {{report to the}} central station via dedicated voice-grade or DC (obsolescent) circuit, or by means of multiple-drop AC grade transmitter (multiplex).Early (c.a. 1980) solid-state alarm controls used shunt switches or momentary closures on the key circuit to arm or disarm the control. Modern controls can use these arming techniques, but more frequently use a keypad which sends <b>operating</b> <b>information</b> to the control. Thus, {{there is no point}} in attacking the keypad, as there is no intelligence in the keypad, it is all located in the control. Also, many controls feature integrated transmitters, using wired telephony or optionally, cellular telephony.

The controls which utilize cellular telephony report either periodically or at a pseudo-random interval to the central station, and a failure to report will result in a dispatch.|$|E
