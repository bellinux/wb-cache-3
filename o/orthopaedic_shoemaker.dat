40|$|Interaction between {{drugs and}} {{solvents}} {{as a cause}} of fatty change in the liver? Occupational exposure to chlorinated and non-chlorinated solvents has been associated with liver dysfunction. ' 2 The levels of exposure have usually been high, but experimental evidence indicates that interaction may occur between different solvents at relatively low levels of exposure. 34 The following three case histories suggest that drugs and solvents may also interact. Case 1 A 52 -year-old man with no history of gastrointestinal disease suffers from lumbago, for which he took acetylsalicylic acid (Paraflex comp). He drank less than 30 cl of alcohol a month. As an <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>shoemaker</b> (1946 - 76) he was exposed mainly to acetone, but also to thinner, chloroform, trichloro-ethylene, and tetrahydrofurane. In 1967 he had raised y-GT (2 - 16 - 2 - 32,ukat/l, normal < 0 70), and three years later also increased ALAT (0 - 81,ukat/l, normal < 0 70). A liver biopsy specimen showed "liver with moderate centriacinar fatty change and pronounced siderosis. " Case 2 Another 52 -year-old man with previous hospital treatment for cholescystectomy, operation for a slipped disc, and myocardial infarction received digoxin (Lanacrist), verapamil (Isoptin), and paracetamol (Lunedon), but took no alcohol. As a painter (1950 - 73) he was exposed to thinner. In 1974 he had persistent increase in ALAT (0 - 72 - 1 - 34,ukat/l, normal 0 08 - 0 58) and ASAT (1 94 - 2 20,ukat/l, normal 0 08 - 0 84). A liver biopsy specimen in 1974 showed "pronounced fatty change in the liver. " Case 3 A 42 -year-old man with high blood pressure and cardiac enlargement but no previous history o...|$|E
