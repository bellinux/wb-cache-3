Interestingly, OsGA 20 ox 1 (<b>Os</b> 03 <b>g</b> 0856700), which is related to gibberellin biosynthesis, is located in both qGP 3 – 1 {{for the number of}} grains per panicle and qSNP- 3 b for the spikelet number per panicle. Putative fatty acid hydroxylase (<b>Os</b> 04 <b>g</b> 0578400), which is involved in carotenoid biosynthesis, and OsSAUR 20 -Auxin-responsive SAUR gene family member (<b>Os</b> 04 <b>g</b> 0608300) was shared in both qSNP 4 – 1 for spikelet number per panicle and qGPP- 4 for number of grains per panicle.

40|$|The {{oriented}} chromatic number <b>o</b> (~ <b>G)</b> of an {{oriented graph}} ~ G = (V; A) is the {{minimum number of}} vertices in an oriented graph ~ H for which there exists a homomorphism of ~ G to ~ H.
