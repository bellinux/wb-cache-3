5|$|Also in 1960, Dutton {{was named}} {{president}} of the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede on a two-year term. He had been a Stampede director for ten-years previous to his appointment. As head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition,</b> he also spoke for the Stampeders hockey team of the Western Hockey League, and was its chief negotiator.

5|$|In September 1936, Ye Qianyu, Lu Shaofei, and Zhang Guangyu {{organized}} the First National Cartoon Exhibition in Shanghai. It displayed over 600 cartoons {{from all over}} the country. After the overwhelming success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition,</b> the artists formed the National Association of Chinese Cartoonists in the spring of 1937. The blossoming movement, however, was brought to a halt by the Japanese invasion a few months later.|$|E
5|$|In September, at the St. Petersburg Open, Raonic won {{his seventh}} singles title—and first in Europe—with a three-set victory over Sousa. His serve was broken just {{once in the}} entire tournament. After early losses at the China Open and Shanghai Masters, Raonic ended his ATP season by {{withdrawing}} from three consecutive tournaments, citing injury. On November 2, he fell outside the top10, dropping to world No. 14. After six weeks off, Raonic joined the Philippine Mavericks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> International Premier Tennis League (IPTL) in December. After four matches, he withdrew due to back spasms.|$|E
5|$|Zagreb {{was one of}} {{the first}} European cities where {{television}} pictures were broadcast. Beginning on 26 August 1939 the Zagreb Fair featured a Philips television system, operated for short periods each day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> (until 4 September). The Philips television, consisting of a transmitter and several receivers, was operated by Eric Klaas de Vries in the Dutch pavilion at the fair. The fair newspaper announced the event as the first, after television broadcasts in London and Berlin. The programming consisted of comedy, opera, music performances and the first TV news broadcast in Croatia.|$|E

5|$|A man of {{progressive}} and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, {{he had a}} special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert {{served as president of the}} Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and had to fight for every stage of the project. In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park. Opponents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith. Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.|$|E
5|$|Bertie the Brain was {{an early}} {{computer}} game, {{and one of the}} first games developed in the early history of video games. It was built in Toronto by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The four meter tall computer allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of tic-tac-toe against an artificial intelligence. The player entered a move on a lit keypad in the form of a three-by-three grid, and the game played out on a grid of lights overhead. The machine had an adjustable difficulty level. After two weeks on display by Rogers Majestic, the machine was disassembled at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> and largely forgotten as a curiosity.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War {{the estate}} {{was used as}} a {{military}} hospital, and in the Second World War was requisitioned by the War Office and used in turn as a transit camp, RAF HQ and US Army Command HQ. The estate was the venue for the 1936 Royal Show. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> buildings, despite its temporary nature, was an innovative piece of modernist architecture still remembered as the Gane Pavilion. It was designed by Bauhaus architect Marcel Breuer as a show house for the Bristol furniture manufacturer Crofton Gane. For most of the 20th century Ashton Court was the venue for the North Somerset Show, however this is now held in Wraxall.|$|E

5|$|From a {{population}} of about 330,000 in 1901, Bristol grew steadily during the 20th century, peaking at 428,089 in 1971. Its Avonmouth docklands were enlarged during the early 1900s by the Royal Edward Dock. Another new dock, the Royal Portbury Dock, opened across the river from Avonmouth during the 1970s. As air travel grew {{in the first half of}} the century, aircraft manufacturers built factories. The unsuccessful Bristol International Exhibition was held on Ashton Meadows in the Bower Ashton area in 1914. After the premature closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> the site was used, until 1919, as barracks for the Gloucestershire Regiment during World War I.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Utzon Center, its art, {{architecture}} and design credited to the noted architect Jørn Utzon, is also dedicated to him. It was built {{next to the}} Limfjord at the central harbour front in Aalborg. Born in Copenhagen, Utzon grew up in Aalborg. The centre contains an exhibition on Utzon's work, which includes the Sydney Opera House, as well as educational displays on {{architecture and}} design. The centre consists of several individual buildings creating a special place around a courtyard on a platform. The tall sculptural roofs of the auditorium and the boat-hall, both on the harbour front, and the library facing the park area and the city are set off by the lower roofs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> and workshop areas inside the complex.|$|E
5|$|Mellor's {{work was}} {{represented}} in the first National Indigenous Art Triennial in 2007, with the elaborate (and elaborately named) sculpture The contrivance of a vintage Wonderland (A magnificent flight of curious fancy for science buffs, a china ark of seductive whimsy, a divinely ordered special attraction, upheld in multifariousness) featuring a diorama that included sculpted kangaroos made with blue and white crockery fragments (evoking Spode bone china), real kangaroo skin (used for the ears and paws), and synthetic eyeballs; stuffed birds sat in a life-sized mixed-media tree overhead. The work featured in media reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition,</b> including by The Adelaide Advertiser, The Canberra Times, The West Australian and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} events to take place in Hyde Park was the Great Exhibition of 1851. The Crystal Palace was constructed {{on the south side of}} the park. The public did not want the building to remain after the closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition,</b> and its architect, Joseph Paxton, raised funds and purchased it. He had it moved to Sydenham Hill in South London. Another significant event was the first Victoria Cross investiture, on 26 June 1857, when 62 men were decorated by Queen Victoria in the presence of Prince Albert and other members of the Royal Family, including their future son-in-law Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia, later Emperor Frederick III.|$|E
5|$|Other early leather {{preserving}} products {{included the}} Irish brand Punch, which was first made in 1851. In 1889, an English {{man by the}} name of William Edward Wren, started making shoe polishes and dubbin under the brand name Wren's. In just 3 years, he won the “First in the Field – First Award Leather Trades Exhibition 1892″ award which was awarded by the Leather Trades Exhibition held in Northampton, the centre of Britain’s boot making industry. This signified the importance and prestige <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> in the trade and was a recognition of Wren's quality. In 1890 the Kroner Brothers established EOS, a shoe polish factory in Berlin, which serviced the Prussian military. It finally closed in 1934 when the Nazis forbade Jews to operate a business. The German brand, Erdal, went on sale in 1901.|$|E
5|$|The finds were {{purchased}} by the museum in April 2009 and underwent conservation by specialists at Durham University and York Archaeological Trust. Using tools of the Anglo-Saxon period, {{a replica of the}} bed was created for the exhibition by Richard Darrah, an expert in early woodwork, and blacksmith Hector Cole, a crafter of medieval-style ironwork. A short film about the princess was made at the Anglo-Saxon museum at Bede's World in Jarrow with a narration by Stephen Tompkinson. Prior to the opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> at Kirkleatham, the finds were put on display for five days in May 2011 at Loftus Town Hall, where they attracted nearly 1,700 visitors.|$|E
