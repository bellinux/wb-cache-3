40|$|Background: Myomectomy is a {{surgical}} technique used for removal of uterine fibroids and historically hysterectomy has represented {{the mainstay of}} treatment. The options of conservative surgical approaches mainly aim at retention of fertility but have to be balanced against potential risks such as haemorrhage; blood loss at myomectomy still remains troublesome with use of various pharmacologic agents yielding inconclusive results. This trial aimed to explore the benefit of combining <b>ornipressin</b> and tranexamic acid during open myomectomy. Study design: A randomized double blind placebo controlled trial. Methods: Women who satisfied eligibility criteria were enrolled into the study and randomized into one of two groups. The experimental group received 1 g of tranexamic acid diluted to 50 ml of saline administered at 100 ml per hour at cutting time (knife to skin). The control group received placebo diluted to 50 ml of saline administered at 100 ml per hour at cutting time. Both groups had five international units <b>ornipressin</b> diluted in 60 ml of saline administered during surgery. The primary outcome (blood loss) was assessed by determining the weight difference of dry and soaked swabs using a digital weighing scale by converting this to volume (ml). Operating time was noted {{from the time of}} uterine incision to the time of uterine closure. The need for transfusion was determined by anaesthetists’ assessment of acceptable blood loss and clinical assessment of vital signs. Post-operative stay was calculated from the time of extubation to 8 am on the day of discharge. Results: A total of thirty-four patients were randomized to two groups; 17 received <b>ornipressin</b> only and 17 received tranexamic acid and <b>ornipressin.</b> There was no difference in blood loss between the groups with a median blood loss in the <b>ornipressin</b> (n = 17) and <b>ornipressin</b> plus tranexamic acid arms of 398 ml (IQR: 251 – 630) ml and 251 ml (IQR: 158 – 501) ml respectively P = 0. 361. Conclusions: <b>Ornipressin</b> administered along with tranexamic acid is not beneficial for blood loss reduction at open myomectomy. In settings such as ours where myomata are prevalent and severe anaemia rampant, blood donation and judicious use of scarce blood resources is key. Efforts to optimize preoperative haemoglobin levels and blood auto-donation seem the most promising options in pre-operative preparation prior to myomectomy.

40|$|In 11 {{patients}} with decompensated cirrhosis and deteriorating renal function, {{the effect of}} the vasoconstrictor substance 8 -ornithin vasopressin (ornipressin; POR 8; Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland) on renal function, hemodynamic parameters, and humoral mediators was studied. <b>Ornipressin</b> was infused at a dose of 6 IU/h over a period of 4 hours. During <b>ornipressin</b> infusion an improvement of renal function was achieved as indicated by significant increases in inulin clearance (+ 65 %), paraaminohippuric acid clearance (+ 49 %), urine volume (+ 45 %), sodium excretion (+ 259 %), and fractional elimination of sodium (+ 130 %). The hyperdynamic circulation was reversed to a nearly normal circulatory state. The increase in systemic vascular resistance (+ 60 %) coincided with a decrease of a previously elevated renal vascular resistance (- 27 %) and increase in renal blood flow (+ 44 %). The renal fraction of the cardiac output increased from 2. 3 % to 4. 7 % (P less than 0. 05). A decline of the elevated plasma levels of noradrenaline (2. 08 - 1. 13 ng/mL; P less than 0. 01) and renin activity (27. 6 - 14. 2 ng. mL- 1. h- 1; P less than 0. 01) was achieved. The plasma concentration of the atrial natriuretic factor increased in most of the patients, but slightly decreased in 3 patients. The decrease of renal vascular resistance and the increase of renal blood flow and of the renal fraction of cardiac output {{play a key role in}} the beneficial effect of <b>ornipressin</b> on renal failure. These changes develop by an increase in mean arterial pressure, the reduction of the sympathetic activity, and probably of an extenuation of the splanchnic vasodilation.

40|$|We present three {{patients}} with ornipressin-induced bradycardia, {{one of which}} developed also ventricular tachycardia of the torsade de pointes type. All {{three patients}} were treated with this vasopressin derivative because of bleeding esophageal varices due to portal hypertension in liver cirrhosis. Bradycardia ceased after discontinuing <b>ornipressin</b> therapy.

Bradycardia is a known but rarely reported side effect of vasopressin and its derivatives. Animal studies suggest that this effect is due to its cardiodepressive action and also to a vagus-mediated reflex following vasopressin-induced increase in blood pressure. When injected directly into the ventricles of the brain, vesopressin leads to a decrease of the heart rate without affecting blood pressure; however, it remains unclear whether this mechanism is responsible for bradycardia after intravenous administration.

40|$|Medical {{treatment}} of cirrhotic ascites is essentially supportive, {{dictated by the}} patient's discomfort, impaired car-diovascular o respiratory function and potential for infection. Treatment of'simple ' ascites (moderate fluid accumula-tion, serum albumin> 3. 5 g/dl, serum creatinine < 1. 5 mg/di, no electrolyte disturbance) is implemented sequentially. Only 10 % of patients respond to dietary sodium restriction and bed rest; most require pharmacotherapy consisting of spironolactone, which increases the proportion of responding patients to 65 % and loop diuretics, which may pro-duce clinical improvement i an additional 20 % (85 % in all); in the remaining 15 % of refractory patients, use of novel adjunctive therapies may be attempted.

40|$|Renal {{failure is}} a common major {{complication}} in patients with advanced cirrhosis and generally indicates a poor prognosis when combined with liver failure. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is characterised {{by a combination of}} disturbances in circulatory and kidney function. Arterial pressure is decreased in the systemic circulation due to reduced total systemic vascular resistance. Kidney dysfunction is caused by reduction in renal blood flow. The diagnosis of HRS is based on exclusion of other disorders that cause acute kidney injury in cirrhosis as there are no specific tests. There are two types of HRS with different characteristics and prognostics. Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for all patients without contraindication. The best approach to the pharmacologic management is the administration vasoconstrictor drugs based on the pathogenesis. Many vasoconstrictors including vasopressin analogues (terlipressin, <b>ornipressin</b> and vasopressin), somatostatin analogues (octreotide) and alpha-adrenergic analogues (midodrine and norepinephrine) have been studied. In most of the studies intravenous albumin therapy was coadministered with vasoconstrictor drugs and suggested that albumin should be considered as the component of pharmacologic intervention in patients with HRS. Renal replacement therapy in the form of hemodialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration has been used in the management of HRS patients awaiting transplantation or in those with acute potentially reversible conditions. The artificial hepatic support systems require further investigation. (Journal of the Turkish Society Intensive Care 2012; 10 : 37 - 44...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{incidence}} of fibroids ranges from 30 % to 70 % in women of reproductive age, with the peak incidence occurring between 35 and 49 years of age. Risk factors for fibroids include nulliparity, obesity, black ethnicity, family history, polycystic ovarian syndrome, diabetes, and hypertension. Fibroids {{are present in}} 5 – 10 % of the patients presenting with infertility. Laparoscopic myomectomy is preferred over abdominal myomectomy because several small incisions are used rather than one larger incision. Related to the small incisions, recuperation is usually associated with minimal discomfort. Women with infertility and fibroids become pregnant after myomectomy in approximately 50 % of cases. The pregnancy rate in patients undergoing hysteroscopic and laparoscopic/abdominal myomectomy is 45 – 49 %. Laparoscopic myomectomy is a technically challenging procedure with surgeon-specific limitations. Preoperative treatments with gonadotropin-releasing hormone {{have been shown to}} reduce blood loss and shorten operative time. The consensus states that the maximal size must be 8 – 10  cm and the total number of fibroids should not exceed four. It is important not to perform laparoscopic myomectomies with more than 5 – 7 large fibroids because in these cases, the procedure is excessively time-consuming and gives the surgeon opportunities to miss the smaller fibroids after the uterus has been incised and repaired in too many places. The role of vasoconstrictors such as vasopressin, epinephrine, and <b>ornipressin</b> help with the control of bleeding from the incised sites. Temporary clipping of the uterine artery is an effective procedure in reducing hemoglobin loss during laparoscopic myomectomy...|$|E
40|$|Background. Hepatorenal {{syndrome}} (HRS) is {{a severe}} complication of cirrhosis and {{is associated with}} high mortality. <b>Ornipressin</b> and terlipressin are effective in treatment of HRS, but are not available in the USA. The efficacy of vasopressin (AVP) and octreotide (OCT) infusions, commonly utilized in the USA, {{in the treatment of}} HRS is unknown. This study aims to evaluate the effects of AVP and OCT on renal function, systemic haemodynamics and clinical out-comes in HRS. Methods. This observational study evaluated patients receiving AVP or OCT therapy for HRS from January 2000 to December 2003. Recovery from HRS was defined as a decrease in the serum creatinine (SCr) to a value 1. 5 mg/dl. Results. Forty-three patients were identified: eight received AVP, 16 received OCT and 19 received both AVP and OCT. Patients who received AVP alone or in combination with OCT had significantly greater recovery rates than those receiving OCT monotherapy (42 vs 38 vs 0 %, respectively, P 0. 01). The average time to response in serum creatinine (SCr) was 7 ± 2 days. The mean AVP doses were 0. 23 ± 0. 19 U/min in patients demonstrating clinical response. Therapy with AVP was an independent predictor of recovery (odds ratio 6. 4, 95 % confidence interval 1. 3 – 31. 8). Patients who responded to therapy had significantly lower mortality (23 vs 67 %, P 0. 008) and higher rates of liver transplantation (23 vs 0 %, P 0. 005). No adverse effects related to AVP therapy were observed. Conclusion. When compared with OCT, HRS patients treated with AVP had significantly higher recovery rates, improved survival and were more likely to receive a liver transplant...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), {{the third}} {{member of the}} natriuretic peptide family, is {{considered}} {{to be involved in the}} regulation of vascular tone. Furthermore, the recent demonstration of CNP in human kidney and urine may indicate a role for CNP in fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the possible role of CNP in renal function disturbances in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.  METHODS—Peripheral venous and urinary concentrations of CNP were determined in samples from 11  healthy controls, 20  cirrhotic patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance 117  (8) ml/min), and 20  cirrhotic patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 35  (4) ml/min). In a second protocol, arterial and renal venous plasma concentrations of CNP were determined in 37  patients with cirrhosis of the liver to estimate renal extraction ratios of CNP. A sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay was applied after solid phase extraction of samples.  RESULTS—Plasma CNP was lower in cirrhotic patients with normal and impaired renal function than in controls (3. 0  (0. 4) and 2. 7  (0. 2) v 4. 2  (0. 4) pg/ml, respectively; p< 0. 05; mean (SEM)). In contrast, urinary CNP was higher in patients with impaired renal function compared with those with normal renal function and healthy controls (47. 2  (7. 4) v 20. 8  (1. 9) and 17. 0  (3. 0) ng CNP/g creatinine, respectively; p< 0. 05). Urinary CNP was found to be inversely related to urinary sodium excretion in cirrhotic patients (r=− 0. 56; p< 0. 01). No differences were observed between arterial and renal venous concentrations of CNP in cirrhosis (2. 4  (0. 2) v 2. 4  (0. 2) pg/ml). In cirrhotic patients with hepatorenal syndrome or refractory ascites (n= 5), urinary CNP decreased from 132  (59) to 38  (7) ng/g creatinine (p< 0. 05) one week after either <b>ornipressin</b> infusion or insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt together with an increase in urinary sodium excretion from 27  (17) to 90  (34) mmol/ 24 hours.  CONCLUSIONS—Increased urinary CNP in cirrhotic patients in the absence of renal arteriovenous concentration gradients suggests enhanced renal CNP production in cirrhosis. Furthermore, an inverse relation between urinary CNP and urinary sodium excretion suggests a role for this peptide in renal sodium handling in patients with cirrhosis.    Keywords: C-type natriuretic peptide; renal function; natriuresis; cirrhosi...|$|E
