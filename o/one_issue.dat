5|$|Kindt took on {{additional}} comic scripting {{work while}} making MIND MGMT, but MIND MGMT was always his top priority. He scripted six issues at a time, then {{worked on the}} art during the hours his daughter was at school. At any given time, he would have <b>one</b> <b>issue</b> completed and ready to print.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>issue</b> {{with which}} ML Pin was deeply {{concerned}} {{was that of}} the country's teacher-training system, an issue he stressed during an audience with King Ananda Mahidol after the war in 1946, and would later address during his term as Permanent Secretary of Education.|$|E

5|$|The Appalachian Natural Resources Law Journal is a {{publication}} of the students at the Appalachian School of Law. The journal focuses on topics which relate to environmental law, natural resources law, and energy and mineral law.

5|$|Ceolnoth, Archbishop of Canterbury {{throughout}} Æthelwulf's reign, also minted coins {{of his own}} at Canterbury: {{there were}} three different portrait designs, thought to be contemporary {{with each of the}} first three of Æthelwulf's Canterbury issues. These were followed by an inscribed cross design that was uniform with Æthelwulf's final coinage. At Rochester, Bishop Beornmod produced only <b>one</b> <b>issue,</b> a cross-and-wedges design which was contemporary with Æthelwulf's Saxoniorum issue.|$|E

5|$|Gerber's defense {{cost him}} his life savings, {{some of which may}} have been in the form of bribes paid through his lawyer. The police never {{returned}} Gerber's personal papers, his typewriter or his remaining copies of Friendship and Freedom despite a court order compelling their return. The only concrete record of the newsletter's existence is a photograph of <b>one</b> <b>issue</b> in a German homophile magazine and a review of the issue in a French homophile publication.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Coolidge {{signed the}} bill, {{which became the}} Act of February 24, 1925, authorizing all three coins. This {{was the first time}} {{commemorative}} coin legislation covered more than <b>one</b> <b>issue.</b> A total of 300,000 for the California piece was authorized, with the coins to be drawn at face value on behalf of the Citizens' Committee by the San Francisco Clearing House Association or the Los Angeles Clearing House Association. The latter group of banks had in 1923 distributed the Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>issue</b> {{that emerged}} from these studies was the problem of {{providing}} early warning to the SCD sites. The SCD's MSR radars provided detection at perhaps , which meant targets would appear on their radars only seconds before launches {{would have to be}} carried out. In a sneak attack scenario, there would not be enough time to receive command authority for the release of nuclear weapons. This meant the bases would require launch on warning authority, which was politically unacceptable.|$|E
50|$|In 2014 {{the second}} {{designated}} postal operator of Kyrgyzstan, Kyrgyz Express Post (KEP), decided to issue its stamps by {{the consent of}} the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan. During that year, KEP has presented two issues of stamps. The first <b>one,</b> <b>issued</b> on November 18, was dedicated to the 140th anniversary of the Universal Postal Union and Postal transportation of Kyrgyzstan. The second <b>one,</b> <b>issued</b> on November 19, was dedicated to Fauna of Kyrgyzstan.|$|R

5|$|<b>One</b> <b>issue</b> {{that led}} to {{accidents}} with the CFM56-3C engine was the failure of fan blades. This mode of failure led to the Kegworth air disaster in 1989, which killed 47 people and injured 74 more. After the fan blade failed, the pilots mistakenly shut down the wrong engine, resulting in the damaged engine failing completely when powered up for the final approach. Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a Dan-Air 737-400 and a British Midland 737-400 suffered fan blade failures under similar conditions; neither incident resulted in a crash or injuries. After the second incident, the 737-400 fleet was grounded.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>issue</b> {{that was}} {{foreseen}} {{as a potential}} problem was the supply of skilled officers to the Army in wartime, and a committee was established in 1906 under Sir Edward Ward to study the matter. It issued two reports, one focusing on university and school corps, {{and one on the}} Special Reserve. The main recommendation of the former was to reorganise the existing school Cadet Corps and university Rifle Corps, which had been formed on an ad-hoc basis as part of the broader Volunteer movement, into a uniform force, administered and supported by the War Office.|$|E
5|$|Queen's University's student {{population}} operates {{a number of}} media outlets throughout the campus environment. The Queen's Journal is Queen's main student newspaper. During the academic year, the Queen's Journal publishes two issues a week, until the last month of the semester, when only <b>one</b> <b>issue</b> is published each week. In total the Queen's Journal publishes 40 issues a year. The newspaper was established in 1873, {{making it one of}} the oldest student newspapers in Canada. The other weekly student publication from Queen's is the Golden Words, a weekly satirical humour publication managed by the Engineering Society.|$|E

5|$|The initial vigour and {{excitement}} {{he brought to}} the job began to fade as administration, commuting and office life became tedious. At {{the same time as}} Wilde's interest flagged, the publishers became concerned anew about circulation: sales, at the relatively high price of one shilling, remained low. Increasingly sending instructions to the magazine by letter, he began a new period of creative work and his own column appeared less regularly. In October 1889, Wilde had finally found his voice in prose and, {{at the end of the}} second volume, Wilde left The Woman's World. The magazine outlasted him by <b>one</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
5|$|Charles's {{cautious}} {{failure to}} directly assault the town, putting {{a higher priority}} on minimising losses than on victory, had cost the Royalists dearly; while claims for their number of dead and wounded men ranged from 1,000 to 1,500, only around 50 people inside the city were killed. Essex's force, on the other hand, was in relatively good shape; its <b>one</b> <b>issue</b> {{was the lack of}} supplies. If he stayed in the Severn Valley, Essex would be unable to get reinforcements or outside aid, the London elements of the army would demand to go home, and the one remaining significant Parliamentarian force would find itself pinned down, while Charles, with secure bases at Oxford and Bristol, would be able to starve them into surrender while other Royalist armies ran rampant through Britain. Because of this, Essex {{had no choice but to}} try to return to London. Travelling back across the Cotswolds, as he had done to reach Gloucester initially, would expose the Parliamentarians to Charles's cavalry on open ground.|$|E
5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number <b>one</b> <b>issue</b> right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the early}} stories were {{completed}} in <b>one</b> <b>issue,</b> but multi-part stories began to appear {{by the middle of}} the series' first year of publication, and there were hints of the ongoing storylines that would later characterize the series. In May 1983, issue #11 introduced many new characters, including most of the 1983 action figure line and the villain Destro, who would become a frequently recurring character. Many subsequent storylines involved the machinations and power struggles between him, Cobra Commander, and the Baroness. Issue #11 established a pattern for the series in which every so often Marvel would publish an issue introducing a group of characters and vehicles that represented the new year's toy offerings.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>issue</b> {{that has}} arisen {{is whether a}} Singaporean who votes {{in a foreign country}} where the right to vote is not {{exclusive}} to nationals of that country is disqualified from voting in a Singapore election. For instance, the United Kingdom permits citizens of Commonwealth countries, including Singapore, who are resident in the UK and have leave to remain there (or do not require such leave) to register to vote in general elections and local government elections. When queried, the Elections Department stated that since suffrage in the UK is not exclusive to British citizens, Singaporeans who vote there are still eligible to vote in Singapore. However, this interpretation of the PEA has not been tested in court.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>issue</b> {{that has}} often raised {{concerns}} {{is the use}} of cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains. It is used as semiconductor component in CdTe solar cells and as buffer layer for certain CIGS cells in the form of CdS. The amount of cadmium used in thin-film PV modules is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3–0.9 microgram/kWh over the whole life-cycle. Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and natural gas 0.2 microgram/kWh.|$|E
