5|$|Passenger {{services}} at the station declined following the Second World War, and the Beeching Report recommended the complete closure of the Portishead line. Passenger {{services at}} Clifton Bridge ended on 7 September 1964, with goods services following on 5 July 1965, although the line saw <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic</b> until 1981. Most of the station was demolished, leaving some remains of the platforms, a retaining wall and the footbridge. Regular freight trains through the station began to run again in 2002 when Royal Portbury Dock {{was connected to the}} rail network. The line is due to be reopened to passenger traffic in 2019 as part of MetroWest, but there are no plans to reopen the station.|$|E
2500|$|Iqaluit has a {{local road}} system only {{stretching}} from the nearby community of Apex to the Sylvia Grinnell Territorial Park, [...] west of town. Iqaluit has no public transportation, although there is citywide taxi service. (There used to be bus service in the city, but the service was cancelled due to low ridership.) Motor cars are increasing in number, {{to the extent of}} causing <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic</b> jams known locally as [...] "the rush minute". However, the cost of shipping automobiles and the wear-and-tear of the harsh Arctic climate combined with its notoriously rough roadways mean that snowmobiles remain the preferred form of personal transportation. All-terrain vehicles are also increasingly common in most of the Canadian Arctic. Snowmobiles are used to travel within the city and in the surrounding area. In winter, dog sleds are still used, but primarily for recreation. In winter, the nearby Qaummaarviit Territorial Historic Park and the more remote Katannilik Territorial Park Reserve are only accessible by snowmobile, dog sled or foot. In the summer, both are accessible by boat.|$|E
2500|$|There are 4,000 {{species of}} animals locally. [...] Common mammals include North American river otters, bobcats, white-tailed deer, raccoons, marsh rabbits, and opossum. Feral pigs, {{introduced}} by Europeans, present an <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic</b> hazard. [...] Lovebug season occurs twice annually in May and August–September. Motorists, usually, encounter swarms of these while driving during a four-week period. [...] Deer flies are particularly noticeable from April through June. [...] There were 596 manatees in Brevard County in 2009, {{out of a}} total of 3,802 in the state. This is a decline from 2007 when there was a total of 859 out of a state total of 2,817. Bottlenose dolphin are commonly seen in the intercoastal waterway. [...] The poisonous brown recluse spider is not native to the area but has found the environment congenial. [...] The Florida Butterfly Monitoring Network has counted species of butterflies monthly for a year since 2007. In 2010, it counted 45 species. Included are zebra swallowtail butterflies. [...] Fish and reptiles include alligators, red snapper, sea turtles, scrub lizards, and rat snakes. There are an estimated 3,500 gopher tortoises in the county. They are on the endangered list.|$|E
5000|$|Belcher's {{merchant}} interests {{included the}} <b>occasional</b> <b>trafficking</b> in slaves. [...] He {{is known to}} have owned slaves, ordering them from his friend, Isaac Royall, Sr. He presented an enslaved Indian to Electress Sophia on his second visit to Hanover in 1708. [...] Despite this, he expressed a distaste for slavery, writing in 1739, [...] "We have but few in these parts, and I wish there were less." ...|$|R

5000|$|Two very <b>occasional</b> <b>traffics</b> {{added to}} the line's {{diminishing}} income: special trains for royalty and enthusiasts, both of which gathered publicity beyond their revenue. The latter were a phenomenon of the 1950s, with the best recorded running along the line (and others) on 2 June 1957 and 23 June 1957. The King and Queen arrived at [...] by train on 6 July 1948. As with the summer Scarborough to Tyneside trains mentioned above, other royal trains touched {{the north end of}} the line when making double-reverses to get to events in Ryedale.|$|R
50|$|Lopez Island is {{a popular}} {{destination}} for bicycle tourists. Some of the roads, however, are narrow {{which can lead to}} <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic</b> and bicycle congestion. But overall the drivers are bicycle friendly and the roads are easier to ride than the other islands.|$|E
50|$|The {{traffic is}} usually very smooth; however, on weekends, {{tourists}} flock to suburban districts causing <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic</b> jams. The exit at Baige Bridge is also usually jammed due to heavy police {{presence at the}} exit. Car crashes also cause rare traffic jams.|$|E
50|$|Just east of exit 191 is a {{significant}} uphill/downhill grade (uphill eastbound/downhill westbound) approximately 2 mi long. Truck traffic is significantly slowed by this hill, causing <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic</b> backups. East of this incline, the route travels through generally rural forested rolling country until reaching the Georgia state line.|$|E
50|$|Through Darwin, {{outside the}} fertile valley, passes the railway that connects Buenos Aires with Bariloche, but {{the line is}} {{currently}} almost inactive, with <b>occasional</b> cargo-train <b>traffic</b> that doesn't stop at the town.|$|R
500|$|Colas Rail owns a small {{fleet of}} {{locomotives}} for duties hauling its track maintenance trains and <b>occasional</b> steel <b>traffic.</b> Locomotives currently operational are 47739 and 47749. 47727 is currently stored out of service.|$|R
5000|$|It {{closed to}} regular {{passenger}} {{traffic on the}} 14 October 1957 but goods, mails and <b>occasional</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> continued {{until the end of}} 1959 [...] It was part of the Great Northern Railway of Ireland railway system.|$|R
5000|$|The transit routes {{for road}} travel {{connecting}} West Berlin to other destinations usually consisted of autobahns and other highways, marked by Transit signs. Transit travellers (link=no) were prohibited {{to leave the}} transit routes, and <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic</b> checkpoints would check for violators.There were four transit routes between West Berlin and West Germany: ...|$|E
50|$|As of 2017, {{the line}} is still in a {{functional}} condition, and sees <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic</b> from Machen Quarry, {{but there is no}} longer a passenger station in the area. Rhiwderin station is now a private residence, though much of its original character has been retained. The station signal box was acquired in 1967 by the Caerphilly Railway Society. It is now preserved on the Teifi Valley Railway.|$|E
50|$|Kraków-Rakowice-Czyżyny Airport is a disused {{airport in}} Kraków, Poland, {{one of the}} oldest {{permanent}} airfields in Europe, open for <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic</b> by certain types of aircraft. A portion of it is now the site of the Polish Aviation Museum with a 720-metre long and 60-metre wide segment of the original concrete runway restored for use by the museum for light planes (to 7,500 kg) and helicopters.|$|E
5000|$|When {{passenger}} services no longer ran via that chord it remained in use for <b>occasional</b> freight <b>traffic</b> until the mid-1960s {{after which the}} chord embankment was removed. A multi-level car park stands {{on the site of}} the chord with no remains of the station.|$|R
50|$|It {{is divided}} into three sections: the {{northern}} section from Plaue to Ilmenau is currently operated once an hour by Erfurter Bahn, the steep section in the middle from Ilmenau to Schleusingen, which originally contained stretches of rack, and the southern section from Schleusingen to Themar. There is <b>occasional</b> freight <b>traffic</b> on the southern section.|$|R
5000|$|According to an {{official}} {{report of the}} Ukrainian Ministry of Ecology, [...] "Since 1958 the navigable waterway through the Prorva Branch had become the main channel for cargo transportation in the Ukrainian part of the Danube Delta", while the Bystroye Channel was reserved for military use until 1992 (and the Bystroye saw only <b>occasional</b> merchant <b>traffic</b> thereafter).|$|R
50|$|The 18-month-long {{construction}} of two ramps connecting westbound I-10 to southbound SH-99 and northbound SH-99 to eastbound I-10 {{was completed in}} 2011. The <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic</b> jams at this intersection prompted the sped-up {{construction of}} the ramps before the through lanes of SH-99 were built through the I-10 interchange. Two more ramps connecting southbound SH-99 to eastbound I-10 and westbound I-10 to northbound SH-99 opened {{as part of the}} construction of Segment E in December 2013. A final ramp connecting northbound SH-99 to westbound I-10 has been completed and is operational.|$|E
50|$|In the 1910 en-masse relettering of fixed-wheel stock {{found the}} letters A, B and D {{replaced}} with X, Y and Z respectively. So the A cars mostly became X class; two, numbers 43 and 44 (ex 54A and 61A) {{were converted to}} XH on account of their condition, and restricted to <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic</b> only. The resulting post-1910 fleet numbered 1-42X and 45-82X. Cars 1 through 41 had been built as A Class but renumbered to B class previously. In 1913, when the Deniliquin & Moama Railway was taken over, one of their first class cars was renumbered to 43A to recycle that number.|$|E
50|$|The line to Forest l'Abbaye {{closed to}} {{passengers}} on 10 March 1947, but remained open for freight until 1 February 1951, {{although there was}} <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic</b> on the line until 1965. The line to Le Crotoy closed on 31 December 1969 and that to Cayeux on 31 December 1972. by which time the line to Le Crotoy had reopened as a heritage railway. The line to Cayeux was subsequently reopened as a heritage railway, and the two lines operate as the Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme. The standard gauge line to St. Valery was operated by SNCF until 6 February 1989 and officially closed from 1 January 1993.|$|E
50|$|Moffett Federal Airfield has <b>occasional</b> air <b>traffic,</b> with {{an average}} of 5-10 flights landing per day. Moffett is {{regularly}} used by the California Air National Guard, NASA, Lockheed Martin Space Systems (commercial satellite manufacturer), the Google founders for their private planes, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department for their helicopter STAR 1, and Air Force One during presidential visits to the Bay Area.|$|R
50|$|After the war, {{during which}} all the docks were badly damaged, the East India Docks were {{confined}} to <b>occasional</b> Channel Islands <b>traffic</b> and {{to the maintenance of}} equipment including dredgers.|$|R
5|$|Grayburn did {{not fire}} on the <b>occasional</b> German <b>traffic</b> still using the bridge, preferring not to {{advertise}} the Allied presence until {{the rest of the}} battalion had arrived. Upon his arrival, Frost began securing more buildings around the ramp, and a small section attack was made on the bridge. The German defenders quickly repulsed this however and Tatham-Warter organised a stronger attack, to be led by Grayburn.|$|R
50|$|As of June 2012 only runway 18/36 {{remains in}} use, with a sealed surface 1303 m long. The runway has no {{lighting}} and {{is suitable for}} daylight operations only. The Aeronautical Information Publication issued by Airservices Australia on 28 June 2012 shows runway 14/32 has now been decommissioned, but is still used for model aircraft. There is no fuel available at the airport. As there is only <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic</b> and no control tower, pilots use a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency to coordinate arrivals and departures, and must stay within defined airspace constraints andmonitor specific radio frequencies when the Evans Head Air Weapons Range 5 NM km southwest of the airfield is in operation.|$|E

5000|$|In the mid-1950s, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) {{began using}} the base as a {{refueling}} {{station on the}} then new [...] "polar route" [...] between Scandinavia and the United States. This use fell off in the 1960s as airliners gained greater range. However, in the 1970s Boeing 707 airliners operated by Dan-Air between the United Kingdom and Vancouver stopped to refuel. The base also became the hub of Greenland air traffic and was the destination for almost all regular air service from and to Copenhagen. The United States Air Force continued to use the base for <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic,</b> and in particular for the yearly resupply of the DYE stations. It was also a center for seasonal scientific activity.|$|E
50|$|Between 1972 and 1997 {{the line}} was used for railway ballast traffic from Meldon Quarry and <b>occasional</b> freight <b>traffic</b> to the {{remaining}} goods yard at Okehampton before its closure. Occasional charter and special trains were operated to Okehampton and Meldon Quarry during the passenger closure period. The railway reopened to regular passenger services in 1997 {{with the formation of}} Dartmoor Railway. A summer Sunday passenger service was introduced from Exeter to Okehampton as part of the Dartmoor Rover network.|$|R
5000|$|Lübeck Airport [...] {{is a minor}} German airport located 8 km {{south of}} Lübeck, the second-largest city {{in the state of}} Schleswig-Holstein, and 54 km {{northeast}} of Hamburg. Until all scheduled air traffic ceased on 15 April 2016, it was the secondary airport for the Hamburg Metropolitan Region, after the much bigger Hamburg Airport, and was used for low-cost and some <b>occasional</b> charter <b>traffic.</b> The airport was therefore sometimes called [...] "Hamburg Lübeck" [...] for marketing purposes.|$|R
50|$|Paine Field {{has three}} runways: 16R-34L, 16L-34R and 11-29. 16R-34L, at 9010 ft in length, is {{suited for the}} {{majority}} of aircraft and sees <b>occasional</b> heavy <b>traffic.</b> It is in very good condition. Runway 16L-34R is 3004 ft in length, and suitable only for small aircraft. Its pavement is in fair condition, with a noticeable rise in elevation mid-field, when compared with the ends. Runway 11-29 is currently closed except for taxiing, and Boeing is leasing some of the runway space to park partially completed 787 aircraft​.|$|R
5000|$|Opened in 1925, the halt - {{the last}} station to {{open on the}} line - sought to {{encourage}} passenger traffic {{in the face of}} increased competition from buses. It was situated to the south of a level crossing over an unclassified road leading to Lower Wainhill and Hempton Wainhill. The lane saw very <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic</b> as it was unsuitable for motor vehicles and only served nine or ten houses on {{the eastern side of the}} Watlington and Princes Risborough Railway. A modest crossing keeper's cottage had been provided by the railway company which comprised two ground floor rooms and one bedroom on the first floor; there was no mains water, gas or electricity. The crossing keeper was responsible for keeping the lamps alight on the gates and, once the station had opened, trimming and lighting the two oil hurricane lamps hung on posts to illuminate the single platform.|$|E
50|$|On 1 July 1961 the {{electric}} tramway closed, thereby depriving the GDLR's conventional line of an <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic</b> - transporting major items, notably tramcars, {{to and from}} the tramway's Pyewipe car sheds for heavy maintenance or repair. This was always a challenge, as there never was any physical connection between the tramway and any other line, but a track at the shed was adjacent to the GDLR conventional line, so cars and other large items were craned over from one to the other. After the Second World War, when the expansion of industry on the Humber Bank was bringing unprecedented usage to both the conventional and electric lines, surplus tramcars were bought first from Newcastle Corporation then from Gateshead Tramways. The Newcastle cars were transshipped without mishap, but when the Gateshead cars were being lifted over in 1951 a crane toppled onto one, damaging it beyond repair before it turned a wheel in Lincolnshire.|$|E
50|$|On January 16, 2009 Astra 5A {{suffered}} a technical failure and all traffic ceased. Much of it (especially channels for German cable service, Kabel Deutschland) transferred to Astra 23.5°E as Astra 1D was {{not suitable for}} the transmission of these services {{because it was in}} an inclined orbit. In May 2009, Astra 2C was moved from the 28.2° east position to Astra 31.5°E to take over Astra 5A's mission with Astra 1D as ultimate backup. In June 2010, Astra 1G was moved from Astra 23.5°E to Astra 31.5°E (following the launch of Astra 3B to 23.5° east), where it could take over all broadcasting activity from Astra 2C, releasing Astra 2C for backup, and releasing Astra 1D for use elsewhere. Astra 1D then commenced movement westwards and in August 2010 arrived at 1.8°E where, with Astra 1C at 2.0°E it was used for <b>occasional</b> <b>traffic</b> such as outside broadcast news feeds. Astra 1D returned 23.5° east in 2012 with two transponders active for several months (both carrying the Luxembourg terrestrial channel, RTL Télé Lëtzebuerg).|$|E
50|$|On 7 March 1988, Cyclone Bola {{struck the}} east coast of the North Island, causing {{significant}} damage to the line between Napier and Gisborne. This led to the abbreviation of the Wellington-Gisborne express at Napier, and although the track was repaired, regular passenger trains ceased beyond Napier. Patronage on the Napier-Gisborne sector was never high except for <b>occasional</b> holiday <b>traffic</b> (it rarely carried more than a busload), and by turning around the train at Napier the number of carriages needed was halved as one train could do a return trip.|$|R
50|$|Nogliki is a {{supplier}} {{for the oil}} fields Sakhalin I and Sakhalin II, located in the Pacific Ocean off the coast to the northeast. There is also some logging activity {{in the area around}} the settlement. The settlement is also the northern terminus of the Sakhalin Rail Network, with the narrow-gauge line reaching the settlement in 1978. Another railway connecting Nogliki with the town of Okha further to the north was completed in 1953; however, this line closed in to passenger traffic in the 1980s, with only <b>occasional</b> goods <b>traffic</b> thereafter.|$|R
25|$|The Green is {{overlooked}} by The Holy Trinity Church of England Church to the South East and bordered {{by a number}} of shops to the North. The Southern corner is bordered by Archdeacon Cambridge's Church of England Primary School and the North East corner hosts a restaurant. There are in total 6 churches visible from The Green and when locals have spotted them all, time can be passed attempting to count as many visible London busses at any one time, due to the popular bus routes along Staines Road and Hampton Road combined with <b>occasional</b> heavy <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
