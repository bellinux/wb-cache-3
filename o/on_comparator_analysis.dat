One key public health area of interest is age-appropriate paediatric antibiotics. We aimed to identify clinically relevant paediatric formulations of antibiotics listed on pertinent formularies that were not on the WHO Essential Medicines List for Children (EMLc). Methods We compared four medicines lists versus the EMLc and contrasted paediatric antibiotic formulations in relation to administration routes, dosage forms and/or drug strengths. The additional formulations <b>on</b> <b>comparator</b> lists that differed from the EMLc formulations were evaluated for their added clinical values and costs. Results The analysis was based on 26 EMLc antibiotics. Seven oral and two parenteral formulations were considered clinically relevant for paediatric use. Frequently quoted benefits of oral formulations included: filling the gap of unmet therapeutic needs in certain age/weight groups (phenoxymethylpenicillin and metronidazole oral liquids, and nitrofurantoin capsules), and simplified administration and supply advantages (amoxicillin dispersible tablets, clyndamycin capsules, cloxacillin tablets, and sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim tablets).

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to assess trends in endothelial {{coverage}} and recovery among leading polymer-based drug-eluting stents (DES). BackgroundAutopsy studies of human U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) –approved DES implanted coronary arteries suggest that complications of late stent thrombosis are associated with incomplete endothelial coverage of struts. MethodsRabbits received sirolimus-eluting stents (SES), paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES), zotarolimus-eluting stents (ZES), and everolimus-eluting stents (EES) for 14 or 28 days along with MULTI-LINK (ML) Vision control stents. Endothelial coverage above and between struts was measured by morphometric analysis of images acquired through en face scanning electron microscopy. Dual fluorescent immunolabeling was performed for platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) - 1 and thrombomodulin (TM), factors involved in cell-to-cell contact and thrombogenicity, respectively. In a separate analysis, the endothelial mitogen, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), was also assessed. ResultsVarying rates of endothelialization among comparator DES were most notable at 14 days, where coverage above struts remained poor in SES, PES, and ZES (≤ 30 %) relative to EES and ML Vision controls (≥ 70 %), whereas no significant differences were observed at 28 days. Select DES with poor endothelialization showed a further reduced expression of PECAM- 1. All DES showed an absence or weak expression of the antithrombotic cofactor TM. Incomplete endothelialization in select DES was further associated with increased VEGF secretion and messenger ribonucleic acid levels at 14 days, providing evidence of a transitional healing surface. ConclusionsThe present study marks the first <b>comparator</b> <b>analysis</b> of endothelial coverage in leading polymeric DES, supporting disparities in arterial healing based on endothelial regrowth and recovery, favoring newer designs over the current generation of FDA-approved stents...|$|R
40|$|Income is an {{important}} correlate for numerous phenomena in the social sciences. But many surveys collect data with just a single question covering all forms of income. This raises issues of quality, and these are heightened when individuals are asked about the household total rather than own income alone. Data are typically banded, implying a loss of information. We investigate the reliability of ‘single-question’ data using the ONS Omnibus and British Social Attitudes (BSA) surveys as examples. We first compare the distributions of income in these surveys – individual income in the Omnibus and household income in the BSA – with those in two other much larger UK surveys that measure income in much greater detail. Second, we investigate an implication of restricting the single question to individual income and interviewing only one adult per household: total income in respondents’ households is unobserved.

40|$|Anosognosia for {{hemiplegia}} (AHP) is characterised as {{a disorder}} in which patients {{are unaware of}} their contralateral motor deficit. Many current theories for unawareness in AHP are based <b>on</b> <b>comparator</b> model accounts of the normal experience of agency. According to such models, while small mismatches between predicted and actual feedback allow unconscious fine-tuning of normal actions, mismatches that surpass an inherent threshold reach conscious awareness and inform judgements of agency (whether a given movement is produced by the self or another agent). This theory depends on a threshold for consciousness that {{is greater than the}} intrinsic noise in the system to reduce the occurrence of incorrect rejections of self-generated movements and maintain a fluid experience of agency. Pathological increases to this threshold could account for reduced motor awareness following brain injury, including AHP. The current experiment tested this hypothesis in healthy controls by exposing them to training in which noise was applied the visual feedback of their normal reaches. Subsequent self/other attribution tasks without noise revealed a decrease in the ability to detect manipulated (other) feedback compared to training without noise. This suggests a slackening of awareness thresholds in the comparator model that may help to explain clinical observations of decreased action awareness following stroke...|$|R
