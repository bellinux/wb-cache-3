40|$|The present paper {{starts from}} the {{assumption}} {{that there is a}} tendency, especially among practitioners, to largely overlap concepts of <b>online</b> <b>marketing</b> and <b>online</b> advertising, thus considering that most <b>online</b> <b>marketing</b> tools aim at the aspect of value communication and promotion. This observation prompted us to try to delineate the categories of <b>online</b> <b>marketing</b> tools according to the traditional areas of marketing activity. Therefore, the paper aims to present the <b>online</b> <b>marketing</b> tools based on a different vision than the literature identified so far. Thus, it was intended to group the <b>online</b> <b>marketing</b> tools on the key components of the marketing activity and the presentation, for each, of certain software tools that support that. The way in which the analysis of <b>online</b> <b>marketing</b> tools was addressed is new and could be useful for defining a structured vision on the field. The paper aims both to analyze concepts specific to <b>online</b> <b>marketing,</b> and especially to carry out a delineation of categories of <b>online</b> <b>marketing</b> tools based on the key areas of marketing such as value creation, value delivery, value communication / promotion, customer relationship management and marketing research.

The intention was to combine the vision specific to theorists to that of practitioners in tackling the field specific to <b>online</b> <b>marketing</b> and <b>online</b> <b>marketing</b> tools. In order to synthesize the information presented in this paper, we also conducted a visual representation of the categories of <b>online</b> <b>marketing</b> tools...|$|R

40|$|This review {{explains}} {{the way how}} <b>online</b> <b>marketing</b> has been replacing traditional marketing in terms of marketing mix. This replacement might happen, because <b>online</b> <b>marketing</b> can give advantages, i. e., offering on-time delivery, increasing effectiveness of two way interactions between buyer and seller, and creating online communities (Szmigin, et al, 2005). The transition of atoms to bits format reflects that tangible products in traditional marketing is being digitalized. The marketing strategies also move from multi level product concept to customer customization. In <b>online</b> <b>marketing,</b> buyers can control over prices, hence pricing trend has been moving from fixed price to dynamic price. In terms of promotion, <b>online</b> <b>marketing</b> becomes a complementary of traditional communication tools, where the strategy {{has a tendency to}} move from personnel selling to direct marketing.
