Neither Sigismund's army nor an alliance of Dalmatian cities and noblemen were able to counter Tvrtko's advances. Split, Zadar, and Šibenik having lost all hope, Tvrtko called upon them to negotiate their surrender in March 1389. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> asked to be the last one to submit and even to be allowed to request Sigismund's assistance once more. Tvrtko granted their wish and decided that Split should be the last to submit, by 15 June 1389.|$|E

5|$|After China's {{defeat in}} the First Opium War, the country was {{forcibly}} opened to foreign trade {{by a number of}} treaties collectively referred to as the Unequal Treaties.

Foreigners, who were centered in foreign sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities,</b> enjoyed legal extraterritoriality as stipulated in the Unequal Treaties. Foreign clubs, racecourses, and churches were established in major treaty ports.
