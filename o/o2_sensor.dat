50|$|The {{titanium}} <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> {{was used}} throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s on a limited basis. This sensor’s semiconductor construction makes its operation {{different from that of}} the zirconia <b>O2</b> <b>sensor.</b> Instead of generating its own voltage, the titanium O2 sensor’s electrical resistance changes according to the exhaust oxygen content. When the air/fuel ratio is rich, the resistance of the sensor is around 950 ohms and more than 21 kilohms when the mixture is lean. As with the zirconia sensor, the titanium <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> is also considered a narrow-band <b>O2</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|E

50|$|As {{with any}} Peugeot model, {{it is very}} problematic. There were many {{reported}} cases of premature failure to coil plugs, turbo, gearbox, ABS sensors, water temp <b>sensor,</b> ECU, <b>O2</b> <b>sensors,</b> high pressure fuel pump and in-tank fuel pump. All within 3 years of ownership. The EP6 engine is very unreliable for certain countries especially those with humid or hot climates.|$|R
50|$|The {{levels of}} NO are around 100-2000 ppm (parts per million) and NO2 20-200 ppm {{in a range}} of 1-10% <b>O2.</b> The <b>sensor</b> has to be very {{sensitive}} to pick up these levels.|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} before, {{the main}} problem with any narrow-band <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> is that the ECM only detects that the mixture is slightly richer or leaner than the stoichiometric ratio. The ECM does not measure the operating air-fuel ratio outside the stoichiometric range. In effect it only detects that the mixture is richer or leaner than stoichiometry. An <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> voltage that goes lower than 450 mV will cause a widening of injector pulse and vice versa. The resulting changing or cycling fuel control (closed-loop) O2 signal is what the technician sees on the scope when probing at the <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> signal wire.|$|E
50|$|The newer “wide-band” <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> {{solves the}} narrow sensing {{problem of the}} {{previous}} zirconia sensors. These sensors are often called by different names such as continuous lambda sensors (lambda representing air-fuel ratio), AFR (air-fuel ratio sensors), LAF (lean air-fuel sensor) and wide-band <b>O2</b> <b>sensor.</b> Regardless of the name, the principle is the same, which {{is to put the}} ECM {{in a better position to}} control the air/fuel mixture. In effect, the wide-band <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> can detect the exhaust’s O2 content way below or above the perfect air/fuel ratio. Such control is needed on new lean burning engines with extremely low emission output levels. Tighter emission regulations and demands for better fuel economy are driving this newer fuel control technology.|$|E

50|$|The {{migration}} of atoms within a solid is {{strongly influenced by}} the defects associated with non-stoichiometry. These defect sites provide pathways for atoms and ions to migrate through the otherwise dense ensemble of atoms that form the crystals. Oxygen sensors and solid state batteries are two applications that rely on oxide vacancies. One example is the CeO2-based sensor in automotive exhaust systems. At low partial pressures of <b>O2,</b> the <b>sensor</b> allows the introduction of increased air to effect more thorough combustion.|$|R
5000|$|The SBEC {{controlled}} the ignition, {{as well as}} the opening and closing of the fuel injectors. During cold startup, wide-open throttle and deceleration, it did this based on [...] "open-loop", pre-programmed operating parameters. During normal idle and cruising, it began [...] "closed-loop" [...] operation, during which the module acted based upon inputs from a variety of sensors. The basic sensors that provided input to the SBEC included the Oxygen <b>sensor</b> (<b>O2),</b> Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor, Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Intake Air Temperature (IAT) sensor and Coolant Temperature sensor (CTS). The basic actuators controlled by the SBEC's outputs included the fuel injectors, ignition coil and pickup, and the Idle Air Control (IAC) valve. The latter controlled idle characteristics. However, the SBEC also {{controlled the}} operation of the charging system, air conditioning system, cruise control and, in some vehicles, transmission shifting. By centralizing control of these systems, the operation of the vehicle was simplified and streamlined.|$|R
50|$|The early {{introduction}} of the oxygen sensor came about in the late 1970s. Since then zirconia has been the material of choice for its construction. The zirconia <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> produces its own voltage, which production makes it a type of generator. The varying voltage will display on a scope as a waveform somewhat resembling a sine wave when in closed loop control. The actual voltage that is generated {{is a measure of}} the oxygen that is needed to complete the combustion of the CO and HC present at the sensor tip. The stoichiometric air-fuel ratio mixture ratio for gasoline engine is the theoretical air-fuel ratio at which all of the fuel will react with all of the available oxygen resulting in complete combustion. At or near this ratio, the combustion process produces the best balance between power and low emissions. At the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, the generated <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> voltage is about 450 mV. The Engine Control Module (ECM) recognizes a rich condition above the 450 mV level, and a lean condition below it, but does not detect the extent of the richness or leanness. It is for this reason that the zirconia <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> is called a “narrow-band” <b>O2</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{there were}} {{difficulties}} adapting the M-block {{to the second}} generation of emissions controls. Unlike previous Ford engines, Thermactor and exhaust gas recirculation features had already been built into the 351M and 400 engine, rendering adaptation to electronic feedback fuel/air systems difficult. One requirement of the second-generation equipment was an oxygen (<b>O2)</b> <b>sensor</b> in the exhaust, {{which had to be}} placed before the Thermactor air was added. Since Thermactor air was injected right into the block's exhaust ports in the M-block, there was nowhere for the <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> to go.|$|E
40|$|Teleost fish {{possess a}} unique, pH-sensitive {{hemoglobin}} (Hb) that, {{in the presence}} of an acidosis, substantially reduces the affinity and carrying capacity for O₂ (Root effect). To date, this efficient O₂ delivery mechanism is only known for filling a swim bladder (SB) against huge pressure gradients (> 50 atm) associated with depth and for oxygenating the metabolically active, yet avascular retinal tissue of the eye. In spite of the clear benefits to O₂ delivery for buoyancy and vision, no study has been conducted to determine whether the Root effect may be important in optimizing O₂ delivery to other tissues such as muscle, which is the focus of this research. During environmental or exercise-induced stress, blood pH may fall; however, some fish regulate red blood cell (RBC) intracellular pH (pHi) by releasing catecholamines that activate the sodium/proton (Na⁺/H⁺) exchanger (βNHE) on the RBC membrane. The βNHE removes H⁺s from the RBC resulting in an intracellular alkalosis, an increase in Hb–O₂ affinity, and O₂ uptake at the respiratory surfaces is safeguarded, which is the ultimate goal of this mechanism. In our proposed model, when adrenergically stimulated blood encounters plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme found in the RBC but also membrane-bound and potentially plasma-accessible in select locations, it will catalyze H⁺s removed from the RBC to form CO₂. This CO₂ will back-diffuse into the RBC creating an intracellular acidosis (extracellular alkalosis), reducing Hb–O₂ affinity, and ultimately elevating PO₂ via the Root effect. We created an in vitro closed system using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) blood where we can (1) simulate an acid-induced Root effect, (2) adrenergically stimulate the RBCs, and finally (3) short-circuit the βNHE via CA (CA-mediated Root effect), all of which can be monitored in real-time (Fig. 1). Data generated currently support our Hypothesis: adrenergic RBC pH regulation can be short-circuited {{in the presence of}} plasma-accessible CA, therefore generating a Root effect increase in PO₂. In fact, if this scenario also occurs in the tissues of O. mykiss, CA-mediated short-circuiting of adrenergic pH regulation can facilitate an increase in PO₂ over 30 times that which would be generated in vertebrates possessing only a Bohr shift! We are ready to test our model in vivo by implanting fiber-optic <b>O₂</b> <b>sensors</b> in O. mykiss muscle while simulating environmental and exercise stress with and without CA blockers. Furthermore, even though CA is not found in general circulation, there are membrane-bound and potentially plasma-accessible isoforms in muscle endothelia, and research is underway to localize this enzyme to understand the relationship between location and function of the short-circuiting. Teleost fish, which are more numerous than all other vertebrates combined (terrestrial and aquatic), have evolved an extraordinary O₂ delivery mechanism, the Root effect, that allows O₂ delivery to the eye and to the SB, thus allowing efficient buoyancy regulation, which {{may be one of the}} most important factors responsible for the extensive adaptive radiation in teleost fishes. Therefore, it is particularly interesting that the Root effect has not yet been investigated for general O₂ delivery. If the Root effect can also facilitate general O₂ delivery in vivo, which our data currently support, this would help shed insight into how the Root effect was selected for prior to the evolution of the βNHE, choroid gland and retia of the eye, and the gas gland and rete mirabile associated with the SB...|$|R
50|$|Automotive oxygen sensors, colloquially {{known as}} <b>O2</b> ("ō two") <b>sensors,</b> make modern {{electronic}} fuel injection and emission control possible. They help determine, in real time, if the air-fuel ratio of a combustion engine is rich or lean. Since oxygen sensors {{are located in the}} exhaust stream, they do not directly measure the air or the fuel entering the engine but when information from oxygen sensors is coupled with information from other sources, {{it can be used to}} indirectly determine the air-fuel ratio. Closed loop feedback-controlled fuel injection varies the fuel injector output according to real-time sensor data rather than operating with a predetermined (open-loop) fuel map. In addition to enabling {{electronic fuel injection}} to work efficiently, this emissions control technique can reduce the amounts of both unburnt fuel and oxides of nitrogen entering the atmosphere. Unburnt fuel is pollution in the form of air-borne hydrocarbons, while oxides of nitrogen (NOx gases) are a result of combustion chamber temperatures exceeding 1,300 kelvin due to excess air in the fuel mixture and contribute to smog and acid rain. Volvo was the first automobile manufacturer to employ this technology in the late 1970s, along with the three-way catalyst used in the catalytic converter.|$|R
40|$|Multiparameter {{cerebral}} monitoring {{has been}} widely applied in traumatic brain injury to study posttraumatic pathophysiology and to manage head-injured patients (e. g., combining <b>O(2)</b> and pH <b>sensors</b> with cerebral microdialysis). Because a comprehensive approach towards understanding injury processes will also require functional measures, we have added electrophysiology to these monitoring modalities by attaching a recording electrode to the microdialysis probe. These dual-function (microdialysis/electrophysiology) probes were placed in rats following experimental fluid percussion brain injuries, and {{in a series of}} severely head-injured human patients. Electrical activity (cell firing, EEG) was monitored concurrently with microdialysis sampling of extracellular glutamate, glucose and lactate. Electrophysiological parameters (firing rate, serial correlation, field potential occurrences) were analyzed offline and compared to dialysate concentrations. In rats, these probes demonstrated an injury-induced suppression of neuronal firing (from a control level of 2. 87 to 0. 41 spikes/sec postinjury), which was associated with increases in extracellular glutamate and lactate, and decreases in glucose levels. When placed in human patients, the probes detected sparse and slowly firing cells (mean = 0. 21 spike/sec), with most units (70 %) exhibiting a lack of serial correlation in the spike train. In some patients, spontaneous field potentials were observed, suggesting synchronously firing neuronal populations. In both the experimental and clinical application, the addition of the recording electrode did not appreciably affect the performance of the microdialysis probe. The results suggest that this technique provides a functional monitoring capability which cannot be obtained when electrophysiology is measured with surface or epidural EEG alone...|$|R
50|$|The {{wide-band}} <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> looks {{similar in}} appearance {{to the regular}} zirconia <b>O2</b> <b>sensor.</b> Its inner construction and operation are totally different, however. The wide-band <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> is composed of two inner layers called the reference cell and the pump cell. The ECM’s AFR sensor circuitry always tries to keep a perfect air/fuel ratio inside a special monitoring chamber (diffusion chamber or pump-cell circuit) by way of controlling its current. The AFR sensor uses dedicated electronic circuitry to set a pumping current in the sensor’s pump cell. In other words, if the air/fuel mixture is lean, the pump cell circuit voltage momentarily goes low and the ECM immediately regulates the current going through {{it in order to}} maintain a set voltage value or stoichiometric ratio inside the diffusion chamber. The pump cell then discharges the excess oxygen through the diffusion gap by means of the current created in the pump-cell circuit. The ECM senses the current and widens injector pulsation accordingly to add fuel.|$|E

50|$|Another major {{difference}} between the wide-band AFR sensor and a zirconia <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is that it has}} an operating temperature of about 750 C.

50|$|Available in both Coupé and Cabriolet forms, styling {{refreshed}} with restyled and body-coloured bumpers, {{similar to}} the 328 with more integrated indicators and driving lamps, and new alloy wheels with a more rounded face. The 3.2 also boasted a major interior update, with a more ergonomic layout and a more rounded instrument binnacle. Later cars, from 1987 onwards, also sported ABS brakes. Fuel injection remained the primarily mechanical Bosch K-Jetronic (CIS) with an <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> in the exhaust providing feedback to a simple computer for mixture trimming via a pulse modulated frequency valve that regulated control fuel pressure. The ignition system was Marelli Microplex, with electronic advance control and one distributor per bank of the V8.

50|$|If on {{the other}} hand the air/fuel mixture goes rich, the pump cell circuit voltage rapidly climbs high and the ECM {{immediately}} reverses the current polarity to readjust the pump cell circuit voltage to its set stable value. The pump cell then pumps oxygen into the monitoring chamber by way of the reversed current in the ECM’s AFR pump cell circuit. The ECM detects the reversed current and an injector pulsation-reduction command is issued bringing the mixture back to lean. Since the current in the pump cell circuit is also proportional to the oxygen concentration or deficiency in the exhaust, it serves as an index of the air/fuel ratio. The ECM is constantly monitoring the pump cell current circuitry, which it always tries to keep at a set voltage. For this reason, the techniques used to test and diagnose the regular zirconia <b>O2</b> <b>sensor</b> {{can not be used to}} test the wide-band AFR sensor. These sensors are current-driven devices and do not have a cycling voltage waveform. The testing procedures, which will be discussed later, are quite different from the older O2 sensors.|$|E

This carbon-fiber chassis, {{rear wheel}} drive {{supercar}} was designed by using Siemens advanced design software, and used a 350 hp (261 kW), mid-mounted GM LS1 engine. An early prototype MT900S, despite being 390 pounds (177 kg) heavier and having 65 hp (49 kW) less power than the production version could achieve a 0-60 mph time of 3.5 seconds, and a quarter-mile time of 12 seconds flat. Since then, the MT900 has undergone several revisions to become the 2005 MT900S, which has 435 hp (324 kW) from its Corvette Z06-derived LS-6 V8, powering a 2,500 lb (1136 kg) car (without fuel). A Photon variant was available which added a Hewland transmission, thinwall subframes, BBS magnesium wheels, titanium springs, and carbon fiber seats and bodywork, reducing the car's mass to 1,980 lb (900 kg). Motor Trend with its guest hot shoe, Le Mans winner Justin Bell, behind the wheel reported a 0-60 time of 3.1 seconds, a standing quarter-mile time of 11.72 seconds and a standing mile time of 30.4 seconds. In addition to breaking acceleration records, Motor Trend also reported 60-0 braking in 100 feet, braking from 100-0 in 275 feet and the ultimate test, 0-100-0 in 10.98 seconds, breaking the 11.15 second record previously held by the McLaren F1 LM.
