5|$|Bush {{accepted}} {{a job with}} Tufts, where he became involved with the American Radio and Research Corporation (AMRAD), which began broadcasting music from the campus on March 8, 1916. The station owner, Harold Power, hired him to run the company's laboratory, at a salary greater than that which Bush drew from Tufts. In 1917, following the United States' entry into World War I, {{he went to work}} with the National Research Council. He attempted to develop a means of detecting submarines by measuring the disturbance in the Earth's magnetic field. His device worked as designed, but only from a wooden ship; attempts to get it to work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> ship such as a destroyer failed.|$|E
5|$|Cain orders Nemesis {{to return}} to the {{helicopter}} so they can leave, but Nemesis turns on Cain and attacks the Umbrella troops. Nemesis is finally killed protecting Alice from an explosion, {{and the rest of the}} survivors seize the helicopter. They throw Cain from the helicopter to the ground to be eaten by zombies, including the now-turned Dr. Ashford. The survivors escape in the chopper as the nuclear bomb detonates over the City Hall, catching the chopper in the blast wave and forcing it to crash. Alice sacrifices herself to save Angela during the crash and is impaled <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> pole, killing her.|$|E

25|$|The reflector, {{made out}} of vapourised {{aluminum}} deposited in an extremely thin layer <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>metal,</b> glass or plastic substrate, can become dirty, oxidised, or burnt, and lose its specularity. This can happen if water enters the headlamp, if bulbs of higher than specified wattage are installed, or simply with age and use.

25|$|Sunlight {{passes through}} the {{transparent}} electrode into the dye layer where it can excite electrons that then flow into the titanium dioxide. The electrons flow toward the transparent electrode where they are collected for powering a load. After flowing through the external circuit, they are re-introduced into the cell <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> electrode on the back, flowing into the electrolyte. The electrolyte then transports the electrons back to the dye molecules.|$|E
25|$|The box-trail {{carriage}} revolved on a turntable {{that sat}} on a ball race on the firing platform and was capable of 360° traverse. The end of the carriage rested on rollers which rested <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> track or rail. For transport the K 39 broke down into three loads, the barrel, the carriage and the firing platform with the turntable. Each of these was carried on a trailer with pneumatic tires. Emplacing the gun took six to eight hours, mainly to dig in and anchor the firing platform.|$|E

25|$|In reality, {{there is}} {{interaction}} between the electrons {{with each other and}} the atomic cores of the crystal. This has several consequences: For example, the unambiguous relation between energy and momentum of an electronic state is broken and an electronic band structure is formed. Measuring the momentum of one electronic state gives a distribution of momenta which are all separated by reciprocal lattice vectors. Hence, an ACAR measurement on a solid with completely filled bands (i.e. on an insulator) gives a continuous distribution. An ACAR measurement <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> has discontinuities where bands cross the Fermi level in all Brillouin zones in reciprocal space. This discontinuous distribution is superimposed by a continuous distribution from the entirely filled bands. From the discontinuities the Fermi surface can be extracted.|$|E
25|$|The Catedral de Santiago (St. James' Cathedral), {{also known}} as the Old Cathedral of Managua was {{designed}} by Belgian architects, and the iron that was used to shape the core of the cathedral was shipped from Belgium. Construction lasted from 1928 to 1938, overseen by Pablo Dambach, who was a Belgian engineer residing in Managua. The architects had been inspired by the church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris, France. The St. James' Cathedral became the first cathedral in the Western Hemisphere to be built entirely of concrete <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> frame. The cathedral survived the 1931 earthquake, but was heavily damaged during the 1972 earthquake, which eventually led to {{the construction of a new}} cathedral located in another part of Managua. Restoration of the old cathedral has appeared to be possible.|$|E
25|$|Facial {{expressions}} {{can provide}} rapid {{feedback on the}} progress of a dialog between two humans, and soon may {{be able to do the}} same for humans and robots. Robotic faces have been constructed by Hanson Robotics using their elastic polymer called Frubber, allowing a large number of facial expressions due to the elasticity of the rubber facial coating and embedded subsurface motors (servos). The coating and servos are built <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> skull. A robot should know how to approach a human, judging by their facial expression and body language. Whether the person is happy, frightened, or crazy-looking affects the type of interaction expected of the robot. Likewise, robots like Kismet and the more recent addition, Nexi can produce a range of facial expressions, allowing it to have meaningful social exchanges with humans.|$|E

25|$|Sodium acetate is {{also used}} in heating pads, hand warmers, and hot ice. Sodium acetate trihydrate {{crystals}} melt at 136.4°F/58°C (to 137.12°F/58.4°C), dissolving in their water of crystallization. When they are heated past the melting point and subsequently allowed to cool, the aqueous solution becomes supersaturated. This solution is capable of cooling to room temperature without forming crystals. By pressing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> disc within the heating pad, a nucleation center is formed, causing the solution to crystallize back into solid sodium acetate trihydrate. The bond-forming process of crystallization is exothermic. The {{latent heat of fusion}} is about 264–289kJ/kg. Unlike some types of heat packs, such as those dependent upon irreversible chemical reactions, a sodium acetate heat pack can be easily reused by immersing the pack in boiling water for a few minutes, until the crystals are completely dissolved, and allowing the pack to slowly cool to room temperature.|$|E
500|$|The artwork for The Blackening was {{designed}} by Robb Flynn, longtime Machine Head collaborator Paul Brown, and Deanna Alcorn.

Christian attempts to seduce Aaron, but the hesitant Mormon becomes upset by Christian's remark that sex [...] "doesn't have to mean anything." [...] Aaron accuses him of being shallow and walks out. Worried that Aaron is correct, Christian joins Project Angel Food, delivering meals to people with AIDS.|$|E

500|$|A novelization of Apocalypse was {{released}} in 2004, written by Keith R. A. DeCandido. In the book, Matt and the Nemesis act as separate personalities in the same body, both aware, but with the Nemesis dominant. Matt eventually regains control after his body is impaled <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> shard while fighting Alice, by showing the Nemesis his memories of Umbrella's experimentation upon [...] "them". The Nemesis is later mentioned in the 2007 novelization of , in which antagonist Doctor Isaacs considers the Nemesis both his greatest success and his greatest failure, hating mention of it and blaming its defection and destruction upon Umbrella's desire to immediately field test it.|$|E

It could also serve as a pillbox. A corresponding post stood on the Kent shore. A small {{concrete structure}} a further [...] north-east of the fort may have been an electrical power house. The minefield was overlooked by a hexagonal radar tower about [...] south of the fort, consisting of a concrete structure <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> frame on which the radar array was mounted. This stands atop a brick building in which the power plant, electrical equipment radar screen and personnel accommodation were located. It was only used for a short time between 1941 and 1943 and is now considered structurally unsafe. Situated nearby is the detached battery built in 1893 to mount four 6-pdr. quick-firing guns. It is well-preserved and the emplacements, ready-use lockers and magazines are all still largely intact.|$|E
