5|$|Strandzha is {{situated}} on Via Pontica, the second-largest bird migratory route in Europe. The bays and estuaries along the Black Sea coast are a wintering destination for some birds. There are 269 avian {{species in the}} park, including populations of global importance of white-backed woodpecker, semi-collared flycatcher, <b>olive-tree</b> <b>warbler</b> and sombre tit, as well as populations of European importance of Egyptian vulture, white stork, black stork, Eurasian eagle owl and four eagle species.|$|E
5|$|The {{masked shrike}} gives the harsh calls typical of this family, with {{repeated}} tsr, tzr or shek notes and some whistles, and when alarmed produces a rattling krrrr. The bill may be snapped when {{the bird is}} agitated. The song, up to a minute long, is soft for a shrike, with chattering sounds interspersed with rich warbles. It resembles the songs of Hippolais species, particularly the <b>olive-tree</b> <b>warbler.</b> On rare occasions, males may sing in flight.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>olive-tree</b> <b>warbler</b> (Hippolais olivetorum) is an Old World warbler in {{the tree}} warbler genus [...] Hippolais. It breeds in {{southeast}} Europe and the near east. It is migratory, wintering in eastern and southern Africa, from Kenya south to South Africa.|$|E
50|$|His Ornithological Synonyms was {{published}} in 1855. His collection of 6,000 birds went to Cambridge in 1867. Whilst travelling in 1835 he discovered the <b>olive-tree</b> <b>warbler</b> {{on the island of}} Zante, and the cinereous bunting in the vicinity of İzmir in western Turkey.|$|E

50|$|Krumovitsa River Valley {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} areas in Bulgaria for breeding black storks (Ciconia nigra) and Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus). Other nationally significant populations breeding at site are the short-toed snake eagle (Circaetus gallicus) (1 pair), Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) (1-2 pairs) and the <b>olive-tree</b> <b>warbler</b> (Hippolais olivetorum) (2-5 pairs).|$|E

50|$|Krumovitsa Important Bird Area {{supports}} 136 bird species. Sixty-four are {{species of}} European conservation concern (SPEC), {{two of them}} being included in category SPEC 1 as globally threatened, 18 in SPEC 2, and 44 in SPEC 3 as species threatened in Europe. The area is of global importance, {{as it is a}} representative biome for the Mediterranean zone. Seven biome-restricted species, typical for the Mediterranean zone out of nine established in Bulgaria, occur there: black-eared wheatear (Oenanthe hispanica), <b>olive-tree</b> <b>warbler</b> (Hippolais olivetorum), subalpine warbler (Sylvia cantillans), Sardinian warbler (Sylvia melanocephala), rock nuthatch (Sitta neumayer), masked shrike (Lanius nubicus) and black-headed bunting (Emberiza melanocephala). Krumovitsa {{is one of the few}} places in Bulgaria where the cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus) and lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) still can be observed. Krumovitsa provides suitable habitats for 46 species, included in Annex 2 of the Biodiversity Act, which need special conservation measures. Thirty-eight of them are listed also in Annex I of the Birds Directive and more than half of them breed in the region in significant populations. The region of the Krumovitsa is one of the most important sites in the country on a European Union scale for the breeding black stork (Ciconia nigra), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus) and <b>olive-tree</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|E

They include red whip snake, Aesculapian snake, European blind snake, sheltopusik (Europe's largest lizard), Kotschy's gecko, European pond turtle, Balkan pond turtle, spur-thighed tortoise, Hermann's tortoise, etc. The sand lizard, which is typical for western Bulgaria but very uncommon to the east, is also present in the park. Ten amphibian species have been recorded, such as European tree frog, eastern spadefoot and southern crested newt. The absence of common reptiles and amphibians, such as fire salamander, common spadefoot and common European viper, is noteworthy.|$|E
