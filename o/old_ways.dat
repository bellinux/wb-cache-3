5|$|Before her stasis {{aboard the}} Spear of Adun, Rohana was a driven protoss {{who was not}} afraid to seek out tasks others thought impossible. She {{displayed}} strict adherence to tradition, yet was creative {{when faced with the}} issues. After she was awakened, Rohana held on to the <b>old</b> <b>ways</b> of the Protoss Empire, openly speaking out against her Nerazim crew, Artanis' Terran allies, and the reawakening of the Purifiers. She served as a reminder of the past, clinging to old traditions and ways, and refusing to cut her connection from the Khala even as Amon continued to possess her, stating knowledge and history {{was the only thing that}} brought unity to the protoss. Though Artanis valued her memories and her ability to see into Amon's thoughts, he began to grow weary of her adherence to the <b>old</b> <b>ways</b> and her objections to his choices, becoming more of a critic than a councilor. Eventually, she came to terms with the Daelaam, and cut herself from the Khala, stating that perhaps history did not need to be recorded with perfect clarity.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the local}} beliefs were perhaps less welcome to the {{practitioners}} of organised religion. An each-uisge was thought {{to live in a}} bottomless well near the summit of Macphee’s Hill, and faery sidhes and their associated music were taken for granted, if generally avoided. The curative powers of the seventh son of a seventh son were assumed to be sufficient for the treatment of diseases as serious as tuberculosis. Yet the <b>old</b> <b>ways</b> themselves were dying.|$|E
5|$|The Church of England itself {{contained}} three groups. Those {{who believed}} {{the form of}} the church was just what it should be included leaders like John Jewel and Richard Hooker. A second group looked for opportunities to reintroduce some Roman Catholic practices. Under the Stuart kings they would have their chance. The third group, who came to be called Puritans, wanted to remove remaining traces of the <b>old</b> <b>ways.</b> The Stuart kings were to give them a rough passage. At the end of Elizabeth's reign, the Church of England was firmly in place, but held the seeds of future conflict.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Old</b> <b>way</b> is {{characterized}} by the formation of lines, symmetry, and precision in the execution of formations with graceful, fluid-like action. Egyptian hieroglyphs and fashion poses serve as the original inspirations for <b>old</b> <b>way</b> voguing. In its purest, historical form, <b>old</b> <b>way</b> vogue is a duel between two rivals. Traditionally, <b>old</b> <b>way</b> rules dictated that one rival must [...] "pin" [...] the other to win the contest. Pinning involved the trapping of an opponent so that he or she could not execute any movements while the adversary was still in motion (usually voguing movements with the arms and hands called [...] "hand performance" [...] while the opponent was [...] "pinned" [...] against the floor doing [...] "floor exercises" [...] or against a wall).|$|R
60|$|Mary was now crowned Queen. She was thirty-seven {{years of}} age, short and thin, {{wrinkled}} in the face, and very unhealthy. But {{she had a}} great liking for show and for bright colours, and all the ladies of her Court were magnificently dressed. She had a great liking too for old customs, without much sense in them; and she was oiled in the <b>oldest</b> <b>way,</b> and blessed in the <b>oldest</b> <b>way,</b> and done all manner of things to in the <b>oldest</b> <b>way,</b> at her coronation. I hope they did her good.|$|R
5|$|A {{few months}} later, Singaperumal is {{transferred}} and a corrupt officer (Vinu Chakravarthy) takes his place. The current DGP releases Teja and together, they urge Gemini {{to work for}} them and repay for the losses they incurred but Gemini refuses. To force him to return to his <b>old</b> <b>ways,</b> Teja persuades Isaac to conspire against Gemini. With Isaac's help, Teja plots and kills Kai. Gemini is infuriated and confronts Teja to settle the issue. During the fight, Gemini beats up Teja and swaps their clothes, leaving Teja bound and gagged. The new DGP arrives and shoots Gemini dead; he later realises that he had actually shot Teja who was in Gemini's clothes. While the DGP grieves over Teja's death, he receives news that he has been transferred to the Sewage Control Board.|$|E
5|$|Mallory {{was placed}} on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs. His {{assignment}} became significant when President Millard Fillmore in his Message to Congress of December 13, 1851, recommended Congressional action on two issues. First was the problem {{of what to do with}} ineffective officers in the Navy. At the time, promotion was based solely on seniority, and no policy existed for removing officers who could not or would not fulfill their duties. Second was the issue of discipline in the enlisted rates. The practice of flogging had been outlawed in the previous Congress, and many of the old captains believed discipline on their warships was deteriorating; they wanted a return to the <b>old</b> <b>ways,</b> or at least a reasonable substitute that would enable them to exert their authority.|$|E
5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Wilhelm Mommsen and Arthur Rosenberg, {{oppose the}} idea that Frederick could have, or would have, liberalized Germany. They believe {{that he would not}} have dared to oppose both his father and Bismarck to change Germany's course; a natural soldier, he was steeped in his family's strong military tradition, and had happily reported to his father since he joined the army at the age of ten. Andreas Dorpalen notes that Frederick had complied with most of William's and Bismarck's policies early in his life, and would have been unlikely to change his behaviour. According to Arthur Rosenberg, despite his liberal tendencies Frederick still firmly believed in Bismarck and his system, with Dorpalen adding that in any case Frederick had too weak and ineffectual a character to have brought about real change, regardless of how long he reigned. James J. Sheehan states that the political climate and party system of Germany during that period were too steeped in the <b>old</b> <b>ways</b> for Frederick to overcome with liberalization. Dorpalen also observes that Frederick's liberal persona may have been exaggerated after his death, to keep the liberal movement strong in Germany, and he points out that the many mistakes made by Wilhelm II helped to paint his father in a more favorable light.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies {{ended the}} month with two four-game home series, against the Marlins and Braves. In their first {{game against the}} Marlins, a 4–0 loss, they had six hits. The next night the Phillies won, 7–4; Asche and Byrd had two RBIs each and the bullpen was solid. In the third game, Domonic Brown failed to catch a fly ball to left field; three runs scored in a 3–2 loss. The Phillies won the series' final game, 5–3, with a 14th-inning walk-off home run by Chase Utley. After the game, Carlos Ruiz {{was placed on the}} {{disabled}} list with to a concussion sustained in the 11th inning. After the Phillies swept the Braves earlier in the month, the Braves returned the favor in the month's final series for both teams. In game one Kendrick returned to his <b>old</b> <b>ways,</b> allowing three runs in the first inning of a 4–2 loss. The next day, June 28, featured a day-night doubleheader. Hernandez started the afternoon game; two errors and six runs allowed by the bullpen led to a 10–3 loss. In the night game, the Phillies called up Sean O'Sullivan for his season debut and lost 5–1. After this game (the 81st of the 162-game season), the Phillies had a 36–45 record before losing the series' final game 3–2.|$|E
5|$|The Sandmans main {{character}} is Dream, the titular Sandman, also known to various characters throughout the series as Morpheus, Oneiros, the Shaper, the Shaper of Form, Lord of the Dreaming, the Dream King, Dream-Sneak, the Cat of Dreams, Murphy, Kai'ckul and Lord L'Zoril, {{who is the}} anthropomorphic personification of dreams. At {{the start of the}} series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence. The character's initial haughty and often cruel manner begins to soften after his years of imprisonment {{at the start of the}} series, but the challenge of undoing past sins and changing <b>old</b> <b>ways</b> is an enormous one for a being who has been set in his ways for billions of years. In its beginnings, the series is a very dark horror comic. Later, the series evolves into an elaborate fantasy series, incorporating elements of classical and contemporary mythology, ultimately placing its protagonist in the role of a tragic hero.|$|E

Creativity leads to capital, and creative products are protected by intellectual property laws.|$|E

25|$|Another {{theme of}} the series is that First World {{countries}} are likely to survive the Change better than Third World countries. Stirling speculates that the developed world is a larger repository of handicraft lore than the undeveloped world, because the latter group heavily relies on First World castoffs and is too busy {{on a day-to-day basis}} to keep up the <b>old</b> <b>ways,</b> while people in the First World have the leisure to become expert horse riders or bow makers.|$|E
