50|$|Another use of ANCOVA is {{to adjust}} for preexisting {{differences}} in nonequivalent (intact) groups. This controversial application aims at correcting for initial group differences (prior to group assignment) that exists <b>on</b> <b>DV</b> among several intact groups. In this situation, participants cannot be made equal through random assignment, so CVs are used to adjust scores and make participants more similar than without the CV. However, even {{with the use of}} covariates, there are no statistical techniques that can equate unequal groups. Furthermore, the CV may be so intimately related to the IV that removing the variance <b>on</b> the <b>DV</b> associated with the CV would remove considerable variance <b>on</b> the <b>DV,</b> rendering the results meaningless.|$|R

40|$|The diurnal {{variation}} (DV) in {{peak expiratory flow rate}} (PEFR) {{has been studied}} among 132 grain elevator workers who accomplished three daily measurements of PEFR during three weeks. DV was calculated as the difference between the highest and the lowest PEFR {{as a percentage of the}} mean PEFR on each day. For the whole group the median was 5. 9 %. DV was higher among smokers and among workers with work related pulmonary symptoms. Analysis of variance showed that only age (p = 0. 012) and smoking (p = 0. 016) had a significant effect <b>on</b> <b>DV.</b> Pulmonary symptoms, total IgE, and duration of occupation had no independent impact <b>on</b> <b>DV,</b> whereas the exposure level of grain dust tended (p = 0. 082) to have an independent effect. Twelve workers had an abnormally high DV (greater than 20 %), of whom seven showed no signs of obstructive respiratory disease by spirometry.
