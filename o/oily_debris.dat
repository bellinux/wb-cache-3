In search of its natural habitat, a large sampling was undertaken in temperate as well as in tropical climates. Sampling sites were {{selected on the basis of}} the origins of previously isolated strains, and on the basis of physiological properties of the species, which also determined a selective isolation protocol. The species was absent from outdoor environments in the temperate climate, but present at low abundance in comparable habitats in the tropics. Positive outdoor sites particularly included faeces of frugivorous birds and bats, in urban as well as in natural areas. Tropical fruits were found E. dermatitidis positive at low incidence. Of the human-made environments sampled, railway ties contaminated by human faeces and <b>oily</b> <b>debris</b> in the tropics were massively positive, while the known abundance of the fungus in steam baths was confirmed. On the basis of the species' oligotrophy, thermotolerance, acidotolerance, moderate osmotolerance, melanization and capsular yeast cells a natural life cycle in association with frugivorous animals in foci in the tropical rain forest, involving passage of living cells through the intestinal tract was hypothesized. The human-dominated environment may have become contaminated by ingestion of wild berries carrying fungal propagule...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{elucidate}} the cytologic findings in simple trichilemmal (pilar) cysts and proliferating trichilemmal cysts (pilar tumors) and the clinical {{importance of these}} lesions. STUDY DESIGN: Aspirates from 12 simple pilar cysts and three pilar tumors, all histologically confirmed, were analyzed {{with a view to}} elaborating on specific cytologic features enabling a distinction from epidermal cysts and other adnexal tumors. RESULTS: Aspirates from pilar cysts showed two different pictures, depending on the age of the cyst. Young pilar cysts showed aspirates with an abundant background of blotchy keratin with or without calcification and inflammation. Older (degenerating) cysts showed <b>oily</b> fluid <b>debris</b> with cholesterol crystals and inflammatory cells. The epithelial component was sparse, and only an occasional syncitial cluster of small squamoid cells was seen. As opposed to this, epidermal cysts usually showed a cleaner background, with very cellular aspirates containing many nucleate and anucleate squames, keratin flakes, platelike crystals and no calcification. The pilar tumors showed a lesser amount of keratin as compared to pilar cysts and yielded large and small clusters of squamoid and basaloid cells, a few of which showed an abrupt association with anucleate, keratinized globules. CONCLUSION: The cytologic diagnosis of a pilar cyst should be made especially in scalp cysts, which yield either abundant, blotchy keratin or <b>oily,</b> cholesterol-rich <b>debris</b> with a sparse epithelial component and which lack a mixture of anucleate and nucleate squames. On aspiration, pilar tumors yield comparatively more cells and less keratin and show small, basaloid or squamoid cells abruptly associated with keratin globules. The cytologic diagnosis of pilar cysts is important because these cysts recur if incompletely excised and often undergo transformation to pilar tumors. Similarly, pilar tumors often clinically mimic squamous carcinomas, and hence {{there is a need to}} outline definitive cytologic features...|$|R
