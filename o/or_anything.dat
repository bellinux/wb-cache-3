5|$|Roger {{attended}} the Council of Tours in 1163, {{along with a}} number of other English bishops. Pope Alexander III named Roger a papal legate in February 1164, but his powers did not include the city of Canterbury <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> to do with Archbishop Becket. They did, however, include Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Arachnophobia is a {{specific}} phobia—it is the abnormal fear of spiders <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> reminiscent of spiders, such as webs or spider-like shapes. It {{is one of the}} most common specific phobias, and some statistics show that 50% of women and 10% of men show symptoms. It may be an exaggerated form of an instinctive response that helped early humans to survive, or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly European societies.|$|E
50|$|It is not {{permissible}} for {{a minister}} {{during his tenure}} to engage in an independent profession, buy <b>or</b> rent <b>anything</b> using state money, rent out <b>or</b> sell <b>anything</b> with state money, or barter with state money.|$|R

5|$|Chapters 5 and 6 {{discuss the}} means of {{cleansing}} the body and mind. The first ten verses of chapter 5 summarize and restate the need for always practicing virtuous self-restraints (Yamas), observances (Niyamas), avoiding anger against anyone <b>or</b> <b>anything,</b> truthfully following Dharma, respecting and learning from the Guru (teacher), and pursuing the proper goals of life without craving for rewards of one's action.|$|E
5|$|News reports linked Caspersen with {{financial}} problems and accusations of alleged large-scale tax evasion that {{were discovered in}} the course of federal investigations into offshore tax shelters managed by financial firms UBS and LGT Bank, and used by wealthy American clients. Near the end of his life, Caspersen was subjected to an IRS audit with a possible focus on alleged offshore accounts. An attorney for Caspersen’s estate claimed that in 2013 the IRS effectively exonerated Caspersen posthumously—with no penalties or fines for offshore accounts <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> else.|$|E
5|$|The pilots' smaller stories {{actually}} make a bigger point, {{which is that}} we're all {{together in the same}} robot … Either we get along or we die. I didn't want this to be a recruitment ad <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> jingoistic. The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together.|$|E

5|$|Training started {{immediately}} {{and concentrated on}} physical fitness, weapons training, movement across country including cliff climbing, obstacle crossing and raiding operations. Weapons training was limited {{by the lack of}} anything other than the personal weapons (rifles and pistols) that each man had brought with him. Machine guns <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> heavier were not available at the time. In August 1940, some officers and non-commissioned officers (NCO) were sent to Achnacarry in the Scottish Highlands on a commando course. These men were then responsible for teaching the rest of the unit.|$|E
5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E
5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> close to that, but I think after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E
50|$|It is not {{permissible}} for {{any member}} of the People's Assembly or Shoura Councils during his tenure to busy <b>or</b> rent <b>anything</b> using state money, or to rent out <b>or</b> sell <b>anything</b> with said money, or barter with it or enter into a contract with the state as an entrepreneur, importer, or contractor.|$|R

5|$|Extraterrestrial {{technology}} could have profound {{impacts on the}} nature of human culture and civilization. Just as television provided a new outlet {{for a wide variety of}} political, religious, and social groups, and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe, allowing them to interpret it for themselves, so an extraterrestrial technology might change humanity in ways not immediately apparent. Harrison speculates that a knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress, leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate for negative effects of technology. He gives the example of improvements in agricultural technology during the Industrial Revolution, which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to the new social order. Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> previously experienced by humanity.|$|E
5|$|Under the Act, it is a {{contempt}} of Parliament to perform certain acts, for instance, to insult the Speaker or any Member of Parliament (MP) coming to or going from Parliament {{on account of}} his or her conduct in Parliament or of anything done or said by him or her in Parliament; or to publish any statement, whether in writing or otherwise, which falsely or scandalously defames, or which reflects on the character of, the Speaker or any MP touching on his or her conduct in Parliament <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> done or said by him or her in Parliament. It is presumably not open to a person charged with one of these offences to argue that it violates the Article 14 right to freedom of speech and expression. However, there is not yet any case law addressing this provision, and thus little guidance as to how the courts are to interpret the restriction.|$|E
