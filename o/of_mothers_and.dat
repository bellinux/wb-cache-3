5|$|Giraffe groups {{tend to be}} sex-segregated {{although}} mixed-sex groups made {{of adult}} females and young males are known to occur. Particularity stable giraffe groups are those made <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> their young, which can last weeks or months. Social cohesion in these groups is maintained by the bonds formed between calves. Female association appears {{to be based on}} space-use and individuals may be matrilineally related. In general, females are more selective than males in who they associate with in regards to individuals of the same sex. Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, as they get older males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups. Giraffes are not territorial, but they have home ranges. Male giraffes occasionally wander far from areas that they normally frequent.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the {{characterisation}} of Shashthi {{underwent a}} gradual evolution. Aforementioned folk traditions originating between the 10th and 5th centuries BCE associated the goddess with {{both positive and}} negative elements of fertility, birth, motherhood and childhood. However, between the 4th century BCE and the 5th century CE, a shift occurred in which Shashthi was increasingly depicted as a malevolent deity associated with the sufferings <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> children. The fifth century text Kashyapa Samhita calls Shashthi by the epithet Jataharini ("one who steals the born") and provides a list of the malevolent activities in which Shashthi is believed to engage, including her practice of stealing foetuses from the womb and devouring children on the sixth day following birth. For this reason, the text recommends that she be propitiated through worship in her honour on this day in the lying-in room and on the sixth day of every fortnight thereafter.|$|E

25|$|A study {{conducted}} in 2000 revealed that poverty of Nicaraguan families heightened {{the risk of}} infant mortality. Its findings also showed that social inequity, or the contrast in wealth between a household and its surrounding neighborhood, further increased this risk. In addition to income levels, {{it has been shown}} that violence against mothers increases the risk of infant and child mortality. Intimate partner abuse also contributes to low birth weight of infants. Overall decreasing national infant mortality trends correspond with higher educational levels <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> lower fertility rates.|$|E
25|$|Baby is {{considered}} {{at risk for}} malnutrition: In certain circumstances infants {{may be at risk}} for malnutrition, such as due to iron deficiency, vitamin deficiencies (e.g. vitamin D which may be less present in breastmilk than needed at high latitudes where there is less sun exposure), or inadequate nutrition during transition to solid foods. Risks can often be mitigated with improved diet and education <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> caregivers, including availability of macro and micronutrients. For example, in Canada, marketed infant formulas are fortified with vitamin D, but Health Canada also recommends breastfed infants receive extra vitamin D {{in the form of a}} supplement.|$|E
25|$|Representations of the bodhisattva in China {{prior to}} the Song dynasty (960–1279) were {{masculine}} in appearance. Images which later displayed attributes of both genders {{are believed to be}} in accordance with the Lotus Sutra, where Avalokitesvara has the supernatural power of assuming any form required to relieve suffering, and also has the power to grant children. Because this bodhisattva is considered the personification of compassion and kindness, a mother goddess and patron <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> seamen, the representation in China was further interpreted in an all-female form around the 12th century. In the modern period, Guanyin is most often represented as a beautiful, white-robed woman, a depiction which derives from the earlier Pandaravasini form.|$|E

25|$|The golden mouse is a gregarious {{creature}} and {{not particularly}} territorial. As a result, the home ranges of many individuals may overlap. In fact, {{up to eight}} mice have been discovered sharing a nest at one time. Groups can consist of kin or unrelated individuals. The most common groups consist <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> their young. Many scientists speculate that living in groups conserves energy. This idea {{is supported by the}} observation that mice are found in groups more often in the winter when such grouping produces a clear cut thermoregulatory benefit. Golden mice have a low basal metabolic rate and high conductance. When their areas become flooded, golden mice activity is significantly reduced. Golden mice typically build two different types of nests: one for eating and one for resting and living.|$|E
25|$|Greece has {{universal}} health care. In a 2000 World Health Organization report, its {{health care system}} ranked 14th in overall performance of 191 countries surveyed. In a 2013 Save the Children report, Greece was ranked the 19th best country (out of 176 countries surveyed) for the state <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> newborn babies. In 2010, there were 138 hospitals with 31,000 beds in the country, but on 1 July 2011, the Ministry for Health and Social Solidarity announced its plans to decrease the number to 77 hospitals with 36,035 beds, as a necessary reform to reduce expenses and further enhance healthcare standards. Greece's healthcare expenditures {{as a percentage of}} GDP were 9.6% in 2007 according to a 2011 OECD report, just above the OECD average of 9.5%. The country has the largest number of doctors-to-population ratio of any OECD country.|$|E
500|$|Howe {{says that}} {{although}} Angelou writes about the Black experience, she draws from the experiences of all ethnic backgrounds. [...] Howe considers the poem [...] "Our Grandmothers", which relates the struggle of a woman attempting to overcome her enslavement and oppression, {{one of the most}} poignant poems in the volume and its focal point. [...] The poem uses the title phrase; according to Howe, Angelou's use of the personal pronoun signifies the universal experience <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> grandmothers and their struggles to overcome obstacles. [...] Howe also discusses the poem [...] "Coleridge Jackson", which she considers another significant poem in I Shall Not Be Moved. [...] The poem describes a man who [...] "wouldn't take tea for the fever"someone incapable of creatively dealing with his suffering at the hands of his employer. [...] Angelou informed Howe that she believed that [...] "Coleridge Jackson" [...] {{was one of the most}} powerful poems she had ever recited in public.|$|E

2500|$|Some Buddhist and Christian {{observers}} have {{commented on the}} similarity between Guanyin and the Blessed Virgin Mary.

One example of this comparison can be found in the Tzu Chi Foundation, a Taiwanese Buddhist humanitarian organisation, which noticed the similarity between this form of Guanyin and the Virgin Mary. The organisation commissioned a portrait of Guanyin holding a baby, closely resembling the typical Roman Catholic Madonna and Child painting. Copies of this portrait are now displayed prominently in Tzu Chi affiliated medical centres.|$|E
