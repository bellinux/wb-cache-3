5|$|Youthfulness : Horace emphasises Troilus' youth {{by calling}} him inpubes ("unhairy", i.e. pre-pubescent or, figuratively, not <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> bear arms). Dio Chrysostom derides Achilles in his Trojan discourse, {{complaining}} {{that all that}} the supposed hero achieved before Homer was the capture of Troilus who was still a boy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he had not}} {{sought the}} office and was not <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> serve, Breckinridge was elected to {{represent}} Botetourt County in the Virginia House of Delegates in late 1780. Legend says he was twice refused his seat because of his age, but his constituents reelected him each time, and he was seated the third time, but official records do not support this. His legislative colleagues included Patrick Henry, Benjamin Harrison, John Tyler, John Taylor of Caroline, George Nicholas, Daniel Boone, and Benjamin Logan.|$|E

5|$|The {{raising of}} school leaving age (shortened to ROSLA) {{is the name}} given by the {{government}} to refer to changes regarding the legal age a child is permitted to leave compulsory education as specified under an Education Act. In most countries, the school leaving age often reflects when young people are seen to be mature enough within their society, but not necessarily when they are <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be regarded as an adult.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the fisher lasts almost a year. Female fishers {{give birth to a}} litter of three or four kits in the spring. They nurse and care for their kits until late summer, when they are <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> set out on their own. Females enter estrus shortly after giving birth and leave the den to find a mate. Implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until the following spring, when they give birth and the cycle is renewed.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of Bart's shoplifting, Marge {{takes the}} family to the same store to get their annual Christmas picture taken. Bart tries to avoid {{detection}} and trouble, but is spotted by Brodka, who shows a disbelieving Marge and Homer the security tape of Bart shoplifting. Disappointed by Bart's actions and concerned that she may be mothering him too much, Marge decides that he is <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make his own decisions and becomes distant with him. Fearing he has lost Marge's love, Bart decides he must regain it.|$|E
50|$|In Lux Bella and Comento he {{presented}} rules for singing chants written in campo aperto {{on a single}} line. This was important since many choirbooks in Renaissance Spain at that time were <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> have the chant melodies written on four-line staves.|$|R

In Zone Three the women are shocked to find the deposed Al•Ith working in a stable near Zone Two. While Al•Ith is pleased to see her son, she too has misgivings about Dabeeb's action. The bumptious women's travels through Zone Three evoke feelings of xenophobia in the locals.|$|E
5|$|Although the Chronicle of Man {{maintains}} that Lǫgmaðr voluntarily vacated his throne, {{there is reason}} to suspect that he was forced from power. In about 1096, the chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1119), and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lǫgmaðr's younger brother, Óláfr (died 1153), was <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> assume control. The chronicle's account could be evidence that, by about 1096, Lǫgmaðr faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable to topple Lǫgmaðr by itself, it approached Ua Briain for assistance in placing Óláfr upon the throne.|$|E

5|$|An {{accomplished}} woman, Finch gained {{her appointment}} as royal governess in August 1762 upon {{the birth of}} George, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King George and Queen Charlotte. Finch's duties included oversight of the royal nursery and all the staff employed therein, as well as organising lessons for the children. Finch oversaw the princes' education until they became <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> live in their own households under the watch of governors, while the six princesses remained under her supervision until they turned 21. Finch retired from her role in 1793, though she continued to correspond {{with members of the}} royal family and receive gifts from them.|$|E
5|$|Clark Kent (Tom Welling) {{sits in his}} loft {{holding a}} piece of coal, waiting for Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) to arrive. He then takes her to the Kawatche Caves, where they are transported to the Fortress of Solitude. Lana is in shock as she looks around at the Fortress. Clark expresses fear that Lana is {{drifting}} away because of his secret, so he decides to reveal his powers to her. Clark then uses the coal to make a diamond ring and proposes marriage. Afterward, Clark reveals {{what he did to}} his parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole), who tell him that he is <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make decisions on his own without the advice of his father. After some initial doubt, Lana returns to the Kent farm to accept Clark's proposal.|$|E
5|$|Denning {{was told}} he would be ineligible {{to serve in the}} Armed Forces because of a {{systolic}} heart murmur, which he believed the doctor diagnosed because he was tired of sending young men off to die. He successfully appealed against the decision, and enlisted on 14 August 1917 as a cadet in the Hampshire Regiment before being sent to the Royal Engineers Oxford University Officer Training Corps. He trained at Newark and was temporarily commissioned as a second lieutenant on 17 November 1917. Although he was <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> serve in the armed forces, regulations meant that he was not allowed to serve in France until he was nineteen.|$|E

She used, I allow, to be rather {{overbearing}} to Mrs. Woodbourne; {{but that was before}} she was <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> fully <b>to</b> feel and love her gentleness. Then she did take advantage of it, and argue, and dispute, but now--' ...|$|R

50|$|A giant ox {{as tall as}} {{the clouds}} is brought from Karelia to Pohja {{intended}} for the great wedding feast, {{but no one can}} be found to slaughter it. One day an <b>old</b> man—small <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> fit under a wooden bowl—rose from the sea and slaughtered the animal.|$|R
5|$|Epaminondas evidently began {{serving as}} a soldier after adolescence; Plutarch refers to an {{incident}} involving Epaminondas that occurred during a battle at Mantinea. Though not explicitly stated, this was probably the Spartan attack on Mantinea in 385 BC, as described by Xenophon; Plutarch tells us that Epaminondas was there {{as part of a}} Theban force aiding the Spartans, so this battle fits the description.* Hanson, Hoplites, 146; Stylianoy, Diodorus Siculus, 172. However, Buck (Boiotia, 63) questions the existence of a SpartanTheban alliance in 385 BC. Epaminondas was certainly not <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have served at the First Battle of Mantinea which was in 418 BC.|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, {{producer}} Kitase {{thought that}} the greatest fan expectation was for the reunion of Tidus and Yuna after their separation in the first game. The game generated rumors about Tidus' connection with the villain, Shuyin, who was physically similar and had the same actors. Square responded that such a storyline, given Tidus' nature, would be too complicated. For the remastering of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, producer Kitase's motivation was to have people {{too young to have}} played the games experience them; his son was only <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel.|$|E
5|$|Keene came to Alaska for {{the first}} time in the early 1970s to attend a cousin's wedding. Attracted by the state's beauty, she {{returned}} for several visits before making the decision in 1977 to move there — alone. Her son Lonnie was deemed <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make his own decisions, and he chose to remain in Minnesota. Keene took a week to drive from Minnesota to Alaska in a secondhand motorhome, ending in Homer, where she parked the motorhome at the end of Homer Spit in the Homer Spit Campground, where it remained for many years. She took a job at a fish processing facility on the Spit, the Icicle Seafoods subsidiary Seward Fisheries, in the spring of 1977, where she later became a foreman.|$|E
