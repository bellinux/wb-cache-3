I only know if I was not--not {{condemned}} to--to this--this life,' (had it not been for a sort of involuntary respect to the gentle compassion of the softened hazel eyes regarding him so kindly, he would have used the violent expletive that trembled on his lip;) 'if I was not chained down here, Master Philip should not stand alone as the paragon of the family.

60|$|I mean {{no disrespect}} to your generation, Sir Patrick: {{some of you}} old stagers did marvels through sheer {{professional}} intuition and clinical experience; but when I think of the average men <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>day,</b> ignorantly bleeding and cupping and purging, and scattering germs over their patients from their clothes and instruments, and contrast all that with the scientific certainty and simplicity of my treatment of the little prince the other day, I cant help being proud of my own generation: {{the men who were}} trained on the germ theory, the veterans of the great struggle over Evolution in the seventies. We may have our faults; but at least we are men of science. That is why I am taking up your treatment, Ridgeon, and pushing it. It's scientific. [He sits down on the chair near the couch].|$|E

You will not find it so dull as you imagine, Jack. There is your work, which will occupy the greater part <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>day.</b> There is your study for the evening. You will speedily know all the people worth knowing round here; I have already {{introduced}} you to a good many, and they will be sure to call as soon as you are settled here. In the stable, my dear boy, you will find a couple of horses, and a saddle, and a dog-cart, so that {{you will be able to}} take exercise and call about. I shall keep the horses. I consider them necessary for my manager. My men will keep the garden in order, and I think that you will find that your salary of £350 a year to begin with ample for your other expenses." ...|$|E

[...] "Can I get the money back from the man to whom it was paid at Wurzburg, when my note fell due {{on the last day}} of the old year? Do I know anybody who will lend me five {{thousand}} florins? Will my father do it? His house has been closed to me for twenty years--and my mother, who might have interceded for me, is dead. Can I appeal to the sympathy and compassion (once already refused in the hardest terms) of my merciless relatives in this city? I have appealed! I forced my way to them yesterday--I owned that I owed a sum of money which was more, far more, than I could pay. I drank the bitter cup of humiliation to the dregs--I even offered my daughter's necklace as security for a loan. Do you want to know what reply I received? The master of the house turned his back on me; the mistress told me to my face that she believed I had stolen the necklace. Was the punishment of my offense severe enough, when I heard those words? Surely I have asserted some claim to your pity, at last? I only want more time. With a few months before me--with my salary as housekeeper, and the sale of my little valuables, and the proceeds of my work for the picture-dealers--I can, and will, replace the money. You are rich. What is a loan of five thousand florins to you? Help me to pass through the terrible ordeal <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>day</b> of reckoning on the sixth of the month! Help me to see Minna married and happy! And if you still doubt my word, take the pearl necklace as security that you will suffer no loss." ...|$|E

60|$|Again, let {{a certain}} part <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>day</b> (as little as you choose, {{but not to}} be broken in upon) be set apart for making strong and pretty dresses for the poor. Learn the sound qualities of all useful stuffs, and make {{everything}} of {{the best you can}} get, whatever its price. I have many reasons for desiring you to do this,--too many to be told just now,--trust me, and be sure you get everything as good as can be: and if, in the villainous state of modern trade, you cannot get it good at any price, buy its raw material, and set some of the poor women about you to spin and weave, till you have got stuff that can be trusted: and then, every day, make some little piece of useful clothing, sewn with your own fingers as strongly as it can be stitched; and embroider it or otherwise beautify it moderately with fine needlework, such as a girl may be proud of having done. And accumulate these things by you until you hear of some honest persons in need of clothing, which may often too sorrowfully be; and, even though you should be deceived, and give them to the dishonest, and hear of their being at once taken to the pawnbroker's, never mind that, for the pawnbroker must sell them to some one who has need of them. That is no business of yours; what concerns you is only that when you see a half-naked child, you should have good and fresh clothes to give it, if its parents will let it be taught to wear them. If they will not, consider how they came to be of such a mind, which it will be wholesome for you beyond most subjects of inquiry to ascertain. And after you have gone on doing this a little while, you will begin to understand the meaning of at least one chapter of your Bible, Proverbs xxxi., without need of any laboured comment, sermon, or meditation.|$|E
