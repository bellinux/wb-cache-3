5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and <b>often</b> <b>think</b> of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E

25|$|O’Sullivan and {{her colleagues}} {{assessed}} 180 girls {{between the ages of}} 12 and 14 on their perceptions on what their first sexual encounters would be like; many girls reported feeling negative emotions towards sex before their first time. The researchers think this is because adolescent girls are taught that society views adolescent pre-marital sex in negative terms. When they reported positive feelings, the most commonly listed one was feeling attractive. This shows how many girls objectify their own bodies and <b>often</b> <b>think</b> about this before they think of their own sexual desires and needs.|$|E

25|$|In Goa, India, {{which was}} a Portuguese colony until 1961, some Portuguese {{influences}} are still retained. A suburb of Margão, Goa's largest city, has a street named Rua de Saudades. It was aptly named because that very street has the Christian cemetery, the Hindu shmashana (cremation ground) and the Muslim qabrastan (cemetery). Most {{people living in the}} city of Margão who pass by this street would agree that the name of the street could not be any other, as they <b>often</b> <b>think</b> fond memories of a friend, loved one, or relative whose remains went past that road. The word saudade takes on a slightly different form in Portuguese-speaking Goan families for whom it implies the once-cherished but never-to-return days of glory of Goa as a prized possession of Portugal, a notion since then made redundant by the irrevocable cultural changes that occurred {{with the end of the}} Portuguese regime in these parts.|$|E

500|$|Holmes's fame {{continued}} through his later years. The Poet at the Breakfast-Table {{was published in}} 1872. Written fifteen years after The Autocrat, this work's tone was mellower and more nostalgic than its predecessor; [...] "As people grow older," [...] Holmes wrote, [...] "they come at length to live so much in memory that they <b>often</b> <b>think</b> {{with a kind of}} pleasure of losing their dearest possessions. [...] Nothing can be so perfect while we possess it as it will seem when remembered". In 1876, at the age of seventy, Holmes published a biography of John Lothrop Motley, which was an extension of an earlier sketch he had written for the Massachusetts Historical Society Proceedings. The following year he published a collection of his medical essays and Pages from an Old Volume of Life, a collection of various essays he had previously written for The Atlantic Monthly. He retired from Harvard Medical School in 1882 after thirty-five years as a professor. After he gave his final lecture on November 28, the university made him professor emeritus.|$|E

500|$|Prior {{to being}} cast as Kyla, Rakie Ayola had made former {{appearances}} in both Holby City and its sister show Casualty - {{in the former}} as a patient, in series five, episode 32 [...] "By Any Other Name", and the latter as a patient's relative, in series 13, episode 19, [...] "Trapped". She was approached about returning to Holby City in a more permanent role by BBC casting director Julie Harkin, who was also responsible for casting fellow Holby City newcomers Luke Roberts as Joseph Byrne and Tom Chambers as Sam Strachan. After {{a series of three}} meetings, two years after the birth of her first child, she agreed readily, despite being [...] "nervous about signing such a long contract", and having claimed just sixteen months previously that she had no desire to work in any long running serial - lambasting the quality of long-term recurring characters by stating: [...] "I watch lots of soaps and love watching them but I <b>often</b> <b>think</b> how frustrating it must be when they make a character into such an idiot. I think it would drive me mad to pick up a script and think, 'Who am I kissing now?'" ...|$|E
500|$|Masashi Hamauzu, the {{composer}} for Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon, was not {{expecting to be}} assigned the soundtrack to the game. [...] In the liner notes for the original soundtrack album, he states that he was [...] "still in high school when that lovable character first made his debut in Final Fantasy", but that the [...] "Chocobo Theme" [...] made a big impression on him, leading him to <b>often</b> <b>think</b> to himself that he would [...] "love to try {{doing this kind of}} work". The soundtrack was the first solo album that Hamauzu had produced. When he wrote his own Chocobo themes for the Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Original Soundtrack, he decided to arrange the opening and ending of the album for a fifty-piece orchestra, which lead {{to the creation of the}} orchestrated Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Coi Vanni Gialli album. [...] In the liner notes for that album, he explains that his motivation for creating the orchestral works was because [...] "Demand for classical music in Japan is still low compared with other countries" [...] and he wanted [...] "to spread the word on this style of music by any means necessary". He ends the note by exhorting his listeners to [...] "take your time" [...] with classical music such as the album, so that one day they will appreciate it.|$|E
500|$|Modern writers <b>often</b> <b>think</b> of Black's role in {{more dynamic}} terms than merely trying to equalize. Rowson writes that [...] "the idea of Black trying to 'equalize' is questionable. I {{think it has}} limited {{application}} to a few openings, rather than being an opening prescription for Black in general." [...] Evans wrote that after one of his games against Fischer, [...] "Fischer confided his 'secret' to me: unlike other masters, he sought to win with the Black pieces from the start. The revelation that Black has dynamic chances and need not be satisfied with mere equality was the turning point in his career, he said." [...] Likewise, Watson surmised that Kasparov, when playing Black, bypasses {{the question of whether}} White has an opening advantage [...] "by thinking in terms of the concrete nature of the dynamic imbalance on the board, and seeking to seize the initiative whenever possible". Watson observes that [...] "energetic opening play by Black may ... lead to a position so complex and unclear that to speak of equality is meaningless. Sometimes we say 'dynamically balanced' instead of 'equal' to express the view that either player is as likely as the other to emerge from complications with an advantage. This style of opening play has become prevalent in modern chess, with World Champions Fischer and Kasparov as its most visible practitioners." ...|$|E
