40|$|Objective: <b>Significant</b> <b>other</b> {{responses}} to patients’ symptoms {{are important for}} patient illness outcomes in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME); negative responses {{have been associated with}} increased patient depression, whilst increased disability and fatigue have been associated with solicitous <b>significant</b> <b>other</b> responses. The current study aimed {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>significant</b> <b>other</b> responses and patient outcomes within the context of daily life. Design: Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM). Method: Twenty-three patients with CFS/ME and their <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> were recruited from specialist CFS/ME services. Sixty momentary assessments, delivered using individual San Francisco Android Smartphones, were conducted over a period of 6 days. All participants reported on affect, dyadic contact, and <b>significant</b> <b>other</b> {{responses to}} the patient. Patients reported on symptom severity, disability, and activity management strategies. Results: Negative <b>significant</b> <b>other</b> responses were associated with increased patient symptom severity and distress reported at the same momentary assessment; there was evidence of a potentially mediating role of concurrent distress on symptom severity. Patient-perceived solicitous responses were associated with reduced patient activity and disability reported at the same momentary assessment. Lagged analyses indicate that momentary associations between <b>significant</b> <b>other</b> responses and patient outcomes are largely transitory; <b>significant</b> <b>other</b> responses were not associated with any of the patient outcomes at the subsequent assessment. Conclusion. The results indicate that <b>significant</b> <b>other</b> responses are important influences on the day-to-day experience of CFS/ME. Further research examining patient outcomes in association with specific <b>significant</b> <b>other</b> behavioural responses is warranted and future interventions that target such <b>significant</b> <b>other</b> behaviours may be beneficial...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{relationship}} {{which is}} widely recognised to exist between a person’s pain and their social environment provides a strong {{argument for the}} inclusion of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> e. g. friends and family, in chronic pain management programmes. To date research concerning the involvement of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in chronic pain management programmes has been dominated by a quantitative approach, with a focus on comparing the effectiveness of programmes with and without the involvement of <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> What is missing from the literature is research illuminating the perspectives of those with pain and <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> about the involvement of friends and family in pain management programmes. This study utilised a qualitative descriptive methodology to investigate the question: “What are the views of individuals who have participated in a Family Day, delivered as part of the 3 week multidisciplinary chronic pain management programme at The Auckland Regional Pain Service (TARPS), on the involvement of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> within the programme?” The purpose of this research was firstly to investigate whether the theoretical rationale for involving <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> within a programme is supported in the views shared by those with pain and <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> Secondly, to provide TARPS with feedback on their service and this may in turn identify opportunities to enhance programme delivery. Thirdly, the findings will contribute to the body of knowledge that informs the delivery of pain management services in general. Semi-structured phone interviews were held with eight people who volunteered to participate in this study after attending a Family Day at TARPS. Conventional content analysis of the interview data resulted in the emergence of two themes: Firstly, the involvement of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in the programme is important so that everyone is on the same page about pain and its management and secondly, the involvement of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in the programme is important so that <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> have the opportunity to access information and support. These views reinforce what is already known about the psychosocial dimension of pain and lend support for the theoretical rationale which is commonly used to justify the involvement of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in a pain management programme. The findings also extend existing knowledge about the involvement of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in a pain management programme in three ways. Firstly, they highlight a wish for <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> to be directly involved in the programme, rather than via media such as the internet. Secondly, the findings point to the importance of involvement finding a balance between what is feasible for <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> and beneficial for all, and thirdly the need for the involvement of children in the programme to be carefully considered. To my knowledge this is the first study that has sought to ascertain views on the involvement of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in a chronic pain management programme, from the perspective of those with pain and <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> For those involved in the delivery of pain management services, the findings from this research highlight the urgent need for research into when and how <b>significant</b> <b>others,</b> including children, are involved within programme...|$|R

5|$|If the {{proportion}} of barbarians was {{in the region of}} 25%, then it is probably much higher than in the 2nd-century regular army. If the same proportion had been recruited into the auxilia of the 2nd-century army, then in excess of 40% of recruits would have been barbarian-born, since the auxilia constituted 60% of the regular land army. There is no evidence that recruitment of barbarians was on such a large scale in the 2nd century. An analysis of named soldiers of non-Roman origin shows that 75% were Germanic: Franks, Alamanni, Saxons, Goths, and Vandals are attested in the Notitia unit names. <b>Other</b> <b>significant</b> sources of recruits were the Sarmatians from the Danubian lands; and Armenians and Iberians from the Caucasus region.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that the <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> of individuals with persistent back pain may have important influences on work participation outcomes. The aim {{of this study was to}} extend previous research by including individuals who have remained in work despite persistent back pain in addition to those who had become incapacitated for work, along with their <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> The purpose of this research was to explore whether the illness beliefs of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> differed depending on their relative’s working status, and to make some preliminary identification of how <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> may facilitate or hinder work participation for those with persistent back pain. Methods Interviews structured around the Illness Perception Questionnaire (chronic pain version) were conducted with back pain patients recruited from a hospital pain management clinic along with their <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> Some patients had remained in work despite their back pain; others had ceased employment. Data were analysed using template analysis. Results There were clear differences between beliefs about, and reported responses to, back pain symptoms amongst the <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> of individuals who had remained in employment compared with the <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> of those who had ceased work. Three overarching themes emerged: perceived consequences of back pain, specific nature of employment and the impact of back pain on patient identity. Conclusions <b>Significant</b> <b>others</b> of employed individuals with back pain focused on the extent to which activity could still be undertaken despite back pain symptoms. Individuals out of work due to persistent back pain apparently self-limited their activity and were supported in their beliefs and behaviours by their <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> To justify incapacity due to back pain, this group had seemingly become entrenched in a position whereby it was crucial that the individual with back pain was perceived as completely disabled. We suggest that <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> are clearly important, and potentially detrimental, sources of support to individuals with back pain. The inclusion of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in vocational rehabilitation programmes could potentially be a valuable way of mobilising readily accessible resources in a way that supports optimal functioning. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background Emerging {{research}} has indicated that ‘significant others’ (spouses/relatives) may have important influences on continued work participation for individuals with chronic non-specific musculoskeletal pain (CMP). In order to expand on this novel area of research, data from studies conducted in The Netherlands and the UK were assimilated. Method In both studies, worker and <b>significant</b> <b>other</b> perceptions of pain self-efficacy, perceived partner responses to pain, pain catastrophizing, and contribution to work participation were explored in relation to the worker's CMP. In the Netherlands, questionnaire data were collected from workers with CMP and their <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> (n= 103), and in the UK, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted (n= 10). Appropriate quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques were applied. Results In the Dutch study, moderate to high levels of perceived pain self-efficacy, moderate levels of <b>significant</b> <b>other</b> solicitous and distracting responses, and low levels of <b>significant</b> <b>other</b> punishing responses and catastrophizing were reported by both <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> and workers. <b>Significant</b> <b>others</b> were viewed as crucial in helping maintain continued work participation by workers with CMP. Overall group averages indicated no significant differences, with the exception of greater pain catastrophizing reported by <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> (14. 4 versus 11. 1 p< 0. 01), although this was not deemed clinically relevant (ES= 0. 34). Qualitative data from the UK study supports these findings, further elaborating on the above concepts. Conclusions This study adds further weight to the evidence which recognizes the importance of social context for successful pain management and vocational rehabilitation interventions...|$|R
