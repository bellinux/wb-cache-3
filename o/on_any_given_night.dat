2500|$|The Battle of Berlin was {{launched}} by Harris in November 1943, a concerted air {{campaign against the}} German capital, although other cities continued to be attacked to prevent the Germans concentrating their defences in Berlin. Harris believed {{this could be the}} blow that would break German resistance. [...] "It will cost us between 400 and 500 aircraft," [...] he said. [...] "It will cost Germany the war." [...] By this time he could deploy over 800 long-range bombers <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>night,</b> equipped with new and more sophisticated navigational devices such as H2S radar. Between November 1943 and March 1944, Bomber Command made 16 massed attacks on Berlin.|$|E
2500|$|The Astros {{finished}} {{in third place}} again in 1977 with a record improved at just one more win than the season before at 81–81. [...] The Astros were still in need of consistent players at key positions. [...] The middle infield was a trouble spot that saw different player playing second and short <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>night.</b> [...] One such player was Art Howe. [...] Howe who almost gave up on baseball before getting a chance in Houston was willing to play anywhere just to get playing time. [...] Howe would hit [...]264 with 58 RBIs while playing at second, short, and third. [...] Howe, like Larry Dierker would also {{become part of the}} Astros future.|$|E

In June 1988 Owen was the record producer for The Plunderers five-track extended play, Trust Us. As a member of New Christs, Owen supplied guitar, piano and organ, as well as co-writing, for their debut album, Distemper (August 1989).

However later that year the group disbanded.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Carlson's {{abundant}} culinary skills, {{his restaurant}} Schwa {{has struggled to}} stay afloat. Carlson has described the restaurant as living [...] "from paycheck to paycheck". This {{has been attributed to}} a complete lack of business acumen, and is a source of frustration for Achatz and Trotter. Despite long reservation waiting lists, <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>night</b> Schwa is usually half empty, partly by choice, partly because Carlson rarely answers the phone. The restaurant's voice mail is frequently full, meaning potential customers are unable to make, or cancel, reservations. Schwa does not have a liquor license, which takes away a large source of potential income (and an even larger source of potential profit). [...] Carlson has claimed limited size of Schwa makes storing wine bottles and glasses difficult, and that it allows him to be educated by the sophisticated customers who bring in their own wines. [...] Achatz called Carlson's decision not the offer wine [...] "stupid," [...] while Trotter said he was [...] "crazy" [...] for [...] "leaving so much money on the friggin' table." [...] For a portion of 2007, Carlson even closed Schwa on Saturdays – traditionally the most profitable day for restaurants – to spend time with his family.|$|E
