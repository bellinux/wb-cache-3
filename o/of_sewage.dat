5|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, city leaders debated the {{responsibility}} and expense {{of creating a}} waterworks system and disposal <b>of</b> <b>sewage.</b> Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s {{as a sign of}} prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s–1940s. With little regard for beauty, steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Large-scale {{livestock}} pollution {{has become the}} third largest source of pollution following industrial pollution and domestic pollution. The possible dangers <b>of</b> livestock <b>sewage</b> pollution on rivers, lakes, underground water, soil, human health are pointed out. Pretreatment is necessary for processing <b>of</b> livestock <b>sewage</b> treatment. The principle, advantages and disadvantages, applicability of three modes <b>of</b> livestock <b>sewage</b> treatment including land spreading, natural treatment and industrialized treatment are summarized. It is very necessary to study and develop efficient, low-cost, resource utilization <b>of</b> livestock <b>sewage</b> treatment technology according to local conditions...|$|R

A comprehensive evaluation is presented to industrial sewage on the base of fuzzy recognition firstly. Then a model of fuzzy artificial neural network recognition is set up to evaluate industrial sewage. Finally, the feasibility and the effectiveness of approaches <b>of</b> industrial <b>sewage</b> evaluation based on fuzzy neural network are validated by some examples <b>of</b> industrial <b>sewage</b> evaluation <b>of</b> Zigong City here...|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the range of applications of archaean enzymes, {{the use of the}} organisms themselves in biotechnology is less developed. Methanogenic archaea are a vital part <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> treatment, since {{they are part of the}} community of microorganisms that carry out anaerobic digestion and produce biogas. In mineral processing, acidophilic archaea display promise for the extraction of metals from ores, including gold, cobalt and copper.|$|E
5|$|Coral {{reefs and}} shallow marine environments are threatened, {{not only by}} natural events and {{increased}} sea temperatures, but also by such man-made problems as pollution, sedimentation and destructive fishing practices. Pollution {{may be the result}} of run-off from the land <b>of</b> <b>sewage,</b> agricultural products, fuel or chemicals. These may directly kill or injure marine life, or may encourage the growth of algae that smother native species, or form algal blooms with wide-ranging effects. Oil spills at sea can contaminate reefs, and also affect the eggs and larva of marine life drifting near the surface.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes {{the time required to}} deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E
50|$|On-site sanitation, {{also called}} decentralised sanitation, {{is a system}} where the {{treatment}} <b>of</b> excreta or <b>sewage</b> {{takes place at the}} same location where it is generated. Examples are pit latrines, septic tanks, and Imhoff tanks. A septic tank and drainfield combination is the oldest and most common type <b>of</b> on-site <b>sewage</b> facility in the U.S., although newer aerobic and biofilter units exist which represent scaled down versions <b>of</b> municipal <b>sewage</b> treatment plants.|$|R

5|$|In July 2006, sewage {{discharge}} from a pumping station {{resulted in the}} death of an estimated 1,400 fish, mostly juveniles. Brian Finn of the Fisheries Conservation Board suggested {{that there may have been}} only a small amount <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> released but the high water temperatures and the low water levels caused by the warm weather at the time increased the fish's vulnerability to pollution. The pollution led to the temporary closure of the boating lake and part of the beach near the mouth of the river.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their high biodiversity, abyssal plains are of great current and future commercial and strategic interest. For example, they {{may be used for}} the legal and illegal disposal of large structures such as ships and oil rigs, radioactive waste and other hazardous waste, such as munitions. They may also be attractive sites for deep-sea fishing, and extraction of oil and gas and other minerals. Future deep-sea waste disposal activities that could be significant by 2025 include emplacement <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> and sludge, carbon-dioxide sequestration, and disposal of dredge spoils.|$|E
5|$|Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Grace dropped heavy rainfall across central Indiana, including a record one-day total of 7inches (178mm) in Indianapolis, while other locations received over 9inches (228mm). Residents prepared sand bags to prevent overflowing rivers and creeks, though rising waters entered streets and over 700 homes. The rapid rainfall in Indianapolis backed up the sewage system, sending {{hundreds of millions of}} gallons <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> into the streets. Following the deluge in the state, the governor {{declared a state of emergency}} for the state. Eight local American Red Cross chapters arrived to provide meals and aid to the affected people.|$|E

40|$|The {{major source}} of water {{pollution}} is domestic waste from urban and rural areas, and industrial wastes which are discharged into natural water bodies. Ground water is the largest source of fresh water in developing countries {{and it is also}} subjected to such danger. In this study we have evaluated the extent of pollution caused in ground water in Perungudi. The study area is one <b>of</b> the major <b>sewage</b> disposal areas in Chennai city stretching up to 400 acres. Around 3000 tons <b>of</b> <b>sewages</b> is generated per day in Chennai city out of this half <b>of</b> the <b>sewage</b> is disposed off in Kodungaiyur and the remaining at Perungudi.

The City later stated {{it did not}} know it needed Federal Government approval to dump sewage into a Federally regulated international waterway.|$|R
5|$|Rotavirus B, {{also called}} adult {{diarrhoea}} rotavirus or ADRV, has caused major epidemics of severe diarrhoea affecting {{thousands of people}} of all ages in China. These epidemics occurred as a result <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> contamination of drinking water. Rotavirus B infections also occurred in India in 1998; the causative strain was named CAL. Unlike ADRV, the CAL strain is endemic. To date, epidemics caused by rotavirus B have been confined to mainland China, and surveys indicate a lack of immunity to this species in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Air pollution, lack {{of proper}} waste {{management}} infrastructure and degradation of water bodies {{are the major}} environmental issues in Coimbatore. There is a sewage treatment plant at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> water per day. Garbage is collected by the corporation and sewage is pumped into the water tanks and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. The tanks are renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and the corporation. The corporation is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks. Siruthuli, an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river. Environment Conservation Group based {{out of the city}} is also involved in conservation of trees and wetlands, monitoring wildlife crime and conducting awareness sessions for students.|$|E
5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, {{described}} {{an outbreak of}} typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A causal link between the bivalves and the illness {{was not easy to}} demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the Norwalk virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may be present in the marine environment even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the treatment <b>of</b> <b>sewage.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{an act of}} {{appeasement}} to the West Harlem {{community for}} the faulty operating <b>of</b> the <b>sewage</b> plant and occupation of limited open space, the state constructed a 28-acre state park known as the Riverbank State Park on top <b>of</b> the <b>sewage</b> plant in 1993. However, fumes and odors continued to seep out of the plant affecting local neighborhoods.|$|R

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> contamination, including sewer odors and debris, in the lower reaches of Nanticoke Creek. The city of Nanticoke has a permit to discharge sewage into the creek. Four combined sewer overflows {{are present in the}} watershed. Orange sediment is deposited on the creek's streambed, indicating a high concentration of iron in the waters. Yellow boy is also present along the creek in some places and can be seen from South Cross Valley Expressway. The concentration of total dissolved solids in the creek is 622 milligrams per liter, higher than the United States Environmental Protection Agency criterion for suitability for aquatic life.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipality}} {{aims for}} a coherent and holistic {{administration of the}} water cycle to protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage green growth and self-sufficiency. The main issues are excessive nutrients, adapting to increasing levels of precipitation brought on by climate change, and securing the water supply. These goals have manifested {{in a number of}} large water treatment projects often in collaboration with private partners. In the 2000s, underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes Årslev Engsø and Egå Engsø were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. The number <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> treatment plants is planned to be reduced from 17 to 2 by 2025 as the treatment plants in Marselisborg and Egå are scheduled for expansion to take over all waste water treatment. They have already been refitted for biogas production to become net producers of electricity and heat. To aid the new treatment plants, and avoid floodings, sewage and stormwater throughout the municipality is planned to be separated into two different drainage systems. Construction began in 2017 in several areas, but it is a long process and is scheduled to be finished by 2085.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, the Corporation {{had made}} {{enquiries}} about purchasing a second-hand steam engine, approaching six locomotive manufacturers, but eventually acquired a new 0-4-0 saddle tank from Peckett and Sons Ltd, {{which was built}} at their Bristol works in 1918. The original engine became a spare, but was hired out to the Blackburn Meadows power station in March 1936. A year later it was condemned by the insurance company, and was sold for scrap to Maden and McKee Ltd, who were based in Liverpool. A replacement was sought, and a third 0-4-0 saddle tank, made by Hudswell Clarke in 1914, was bought from the Olympia Oil and Cake Company at Selby. It was coupled into a goods train, and arrived at the works in July 1937. At the works, as at Selby, it carried the name Olympia, painted on the tanks. The Peckett was overhauled by the Yorkshire Engine Company at Meadow Hall Works between 1945 and 1946. Because there was a statutory obligation to keep the treatment works operational, a special dispensation was obtained during the 1926 general strike, to allow this engine to run over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip. Kilnhurst tip eventually became full, and in January 1948, regular tipping operations ceased, after a new tip at Thrybergh opened. Tipping continued at Kilnhurst sporadically, until it was closed in 1959. During its operational life up to 1948, 2,917,480 tons <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> sludge was dumped at the site, and following closure, it was sold to the National Coal Board in 1961.|$|E
