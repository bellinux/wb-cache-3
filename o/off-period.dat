This type of dyskinesias may appear in patients even in the prolonged absence of antiparkinson medication and be aggravated by levodopa. Therefore, pharmacological therapeutic approaches in these patients are limited. Here we report two patients with bilateral fetal nigral grafts in the caudate and putamen subjected to deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) or subthalamic nucleus (STN). Clinical assessment was performed according to UPDRS and the clinical dyskinesia rating scale. In both patients, we found significant improvement in <b>OFF-period</b> symptoms as well as levodopa-induced dyskinesias. However, only GPi-DBS led to a significant reduction of <b>OFF-period</b> dyskinesias whereas STN-DBS did not influence dyskinesias unrelated to external dopaminergic application. These findings, based on two case reports, highlight the pivotal role of the GPi in mediating dyskinesia-related neural activity within the basal ganglia loop.

In comparison to subthalamic nucleus DBS there is a paucity of data on GPi DBS outcomes. We present our experience {{with a group of}} 20 PD patients (9 unilateral, 11 bilateral) who underwent GPi stimulation. PD motor symptoms were assessed using the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III scores and subscores, and dyskinesia using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), UPDRS part IVa, and clinical global impression (CGI). At mean follow-up time of 7 months, bilateral stimulation reduced <b>off-period</b> motor scores by a mean of 46 % and on-period motor scores by 18 %. Unilateral stimulation reduced <b>off-period</b> motor scores by 18 %. Dyskinesia severity was reduced by 76 %, which was maintained after a mean follow-up time of 35 months. Antiparkinsonian medication dosage was unchanged. No major adverse effects were seen. Unilateral and bilateral GPi DBS provides lasting benefit in PD patients with severe LID.

The results are: (1) presenting an ambiguous figure intermittently increased the perceptual reversal rate; (2) the longer the exposure of Necker cube, the slower the perceptual reversal rate was, and when on-periods were longer as 15  s, the perceptual reversal rate was slowed down and was almost same to that in the continuous case; (3) the length of <b>off-periods</b> (which ranged from 1  s to 5  s in the present study) did not affect the reversal rate.|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring non-rapid eye {{movement}} (NREM) sleep (stage N 3), when consciousness fades, cortico-cortical interactions are impaired while neurons are still active and reactive. Why is this? We compared cortico-cortical evoked-potentials recorded during wakefulness and NREM {{by means of}} time–frequency analysis and phase-locking measures in 8 epileptic patients undergoing intra-cerebral stimulations/recordings for clinical evaluation. We observed that, while during wakefulness electrical stimulation triggers a chain of deterministic phase-locked activations in its cortical targets, during NREM the same input induces a slow wave associated with an <b>OFF-period</b> (suppression of power> 20 Hz), possibly reflecting a neuronal down-state.

40|$|When observing {{bistable}} stimuli, the percept {{can change}} {{in the absence of}} changes in the stimulus itself. When intermittently presenting a bistable stimulus, the number of perceptual alternations can increase or decrease, depending on the duration of the period that the stimulus is removed from screen between stimulus presentations (<b>off-period).</b> Longer off-periods lead to stabilization of the percept, while short off-periods produce perceptual alternations. Here we compare fMRI brain activation across percept repetitions and alternations when observing an intermittently presented ambiguously rotating structure from motion sphere. In the first experimental session, subjects were requested to voluntarily control the percept into either a repeating or an alternating perceptual regime at a single <b>off-period.</b> In a consecutive session, subjects observed the sphere uninstructed, and reported alternations and repetitions. The behavioral data showed that there were marked individual biases for observing the sphere as either repeating or alternating. The fMRI data showed activation differences between alternating and repeating perceptual regimes in an extensive network that included parietal cortex, dorsal premotor area, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, insula, and cerebellum. However, these activation differences could all be explained by intersubject differences in the bias for one of the two perceptual regimes. The stronger the bias was for a particular perceptual regime, the less activation and vice versa. We conclude that widespread activation differences between perceptual regimes can be accounted for by differences in the perceptual bias for one of the two regime...|$|E

40|$|In Sprague–Dawley rats, brown {{adipose tissue}} (BAT) {{thermogenesis}} occurs in an episodic ultradianmanner (BAT on-periods) {{as part of}} the basic rest–activity cycle (BRAC). Eating occurs approximately 15 min after the onset of BAT on-periods. Zucker obese (fa/fa) rats eat larger less frequent meals than control rats. In chronically instrumented conscious unrestrained Zucker obese rats we examined ultradian fluctuations in BAT, body and brain temperatures, and the relation between BAT temperature and eating. The interval between BAT temperature peaks for the 12 hour dark phase was 121 ± 3 (mean ± SE) min for Zucker obese rats and 91 ± 3 min for control lean rats (p b 0. 01). Corresponding values for the light phase were 148 ± 6 and 118 ± 4 min (p b 0. 01). Mean BAT and body temperatures were lower in Zucker obese rats, in comparison with lean controls, during both BAT on-periods and BAT <b>off-periods.</b> Mean brain temperatures were lower during BAT <b>off-periods.</b> Amplitudes of the BRAC-related increases in all 3 temperatures were greater in the Zucker obese rats. Meal onset in Zucker obese rats commenced 15 ± 1 min after the onset of a BAT on-period, not significantly different for the delay observed in lean control rats (18 ± 1 min, p > 0. 05). Thus periods between eating are increased in the Zucker obese rats, but the action of leptin, absent in these animals, is not crucial for the timing of eating in relation to increases in BAT and body temperature. Lack of the normal excitatory action of leptin on brain-regulated BAT sympathetic discharge could also contribute to lower BAT thermogenesis in Zucker obese rats...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{studies of}} the traffic in {{computer}} networks suggest that network traffic exhibits self-similarity and long-range dependence.

30|$|The Average Reversal Interval (ARI), {{defined as}} time {{interval}} between reversals {{in the perception}} of an ambiguous stimulus, is typically used to evaluate how fast perceptual reversals occur, and calculated by dividing trail duration by the number of reversals. The calculation is undoubtedly right when a stimulus is presented continuously. However, when a stimulus is presented intermittently, it is questionable to use whole trial duration to calculate the ARI since there are exactly no reversals could be consciously perceived during off-periods. Take account of this, we eliminated off-periods and only use the accumulated time of on-periods to calculate ARI. In order to differentiate from original ARI, we define it as netARI. Since there is no <b>off-period</b> in continuous conditions, then netARIs are same to ARI in continuous conditions. In order to avoid any confusion, we call ARI as netARI even in continuous conditions.|$|E

In this clinical setting it competes directly with intrajejunal levodopa and deep brain stimulation (DBS), however randomised controlled comparative studies are lacking. The advantages of CSAI is that it is the least invasive of these three therapeutic options, is reversible, practical to use and has shown significant efficacy for the management of both peak-effect dyskinesias and <b>off-period</b> nonmotor-symptoms. Contraindications to the use of CSAI are severe dementia or neuropsychiatric symptoms and severe biphasic dyskinesias, however unlike DBS, advanced age is not a contraindication.

Since preventive maintenance can be planned during <b>off-periods,</b> there is a perspective of significant savings if some freedom is built in concerning the starting time of preventive maintenance. Therefore, a two-stage maintenance policy is considered, which—in a first stage—provides the maintenance manager with a finite interval during which preventive maintenance must be carried out, and—in a second stage—determines the optimal starting time for preventive maintenance within this interval.

For such queueing systems, wedevelop two new numerical methods to estimate the loss probability. The numerical methods exploit an exact relation between the loss probability in a finite-buffer queue and the queue length distribution in the corresponding infinite-buffer queue. The exact relation enable us to efficiently compute the loss probability with sufficient accuracy, since the asymptotic or exact queue length distribution in the infinite-buffer queue can be efficiently estimated by stable formulas...|$|R
