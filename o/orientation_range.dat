40|$|AbstractContrast {{detection}} performance {{is known to}} be better for single component sinusoidal gratings than for sums of gratings at different orientations. A recent study Rovamo et al. (1994) (Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science, 35, 2611 – 2619) showed that spatial integration is less effective for multiple orientation component than for single component gratings. This suggests an explanation that the size of a spatial integration window depends on the orientation contents of the stimulus. To test this hypothesis we designed a computational detection model and tested it against new experimental data. The model generates a cross-correlation template, the extent of which is limited both in the spatial and spatial frequency domain. The template is a copy of the band-pass filtered signal weighted by a spatial window function. The spatial window function, which limits spatial integration, decreases with increasing <b>orientation</b> <b>range</b> of the stimulus. The experimental stimuli were composed of side-by-side located square shaped, one cycle, grating patches. The range of either grating orientations or phases within the patches as well as the number of patches in a stimulus were varied. We also measured detection efficiency for Bessel Jo images as a function of area. Human spatial integration became considerably weaker with increasing <b>orientation</b> <b>range.</b> The increasing phase range also reduced detection efficiency to some extent. Supporting the idea of the varying size of the spatial integration window, the computational model explained the orientation, phase, and Bessel Jo data well. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|In {{traditional}} light-field analysis, {{images have}} matched spectral content {{which leads to}} constant intensity on epipolar plane image (EPI) manifolds. This kind of light field is termed homogeneous light field. Heterogeneous light fields differ in that contributing images may have varying properties such as exposure selected or color filter applied. To be able to process heterogeneous light fields {{it is necessary to}} develop a computation method able to estimate orientations in heterogeneous EPI respectively. One alternative method to estimate orientation is the singular value decomposition. This analysis has resulted in new concepts for improving the structure tensor approach and yielded increased accuracy and greater applicability through exploitation of heterogeneous light fields. While the current structure tensor only estimates orientation with constant pixel intensity along the direction of orientation, the newly designed structure tensor is able to estimate orientations under changing intensity. Additionally, this improved structure tensor makes it possible to process acquired light fields with a higher reliability due to robustness against illumination changes. In order to use this improved structure tensor approach, it is important to design the light-field camera setup that the target scene covers the ± 45 ° <b>orientation</b> <b>range</b> perfectly. This requirement leads directly to a relationship between camera setup for light-field capture and the frustum-shaped volume of interest. We show that higher-precision depth maps are achievable, which has a positive impact on the reliability of subsequent processing methods, especially for sRGB color reconstruction in color-filtered light fields. Aside this, a global shifting process is designed to overcome the basic range limitation of ± 45 ° to estimate larger distances and to increase additionally the achievable precision in light-field processing. That enables the possibility to research spherical light fields, since the <b>orientation</b> <b>range</b> of spherical light fields typically overcomes the ± 45 ° limit. Research in spherically acquired light fields has been conducted in collaboration with the German Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) in Kaiserslautern...|$|E

Stability conditions for a planar tube pair are derived and used to define an optimal design problem.

Stimuli were upright and inverted faces filtered to preserve information in the horizontal or vertical orientation, or both (HV) ranges.

Conventional wisdom about two-level factorial experiments, which is deeply rooted on normal response models, does not apply to binomial models.

40|$|Background: A growing {{interest}} in frailty syndrome exists because it {{is regarded as a}} major predictor of co-morbidities and mortality in older populations. Nevertheless, frailty assessment has been controversial, particularly when identifying this syndrome in a community setting. Performance tests such as the 30 -second chair stand test (30 -s CST) are a cornerstone for detecting early declines in functional independence. Additionally, recent advances in body-fixed sensors have enhanced the sensors’ ability to automatically and accurately evaluate kinematic parameters related to a specific movement performance. The {{purpose of this study is}} to use this new technology to obtain kinematic parameters that can identify frailty in an aged population through the performance the 30 -s CST. Methods: Eighteen adults with a mean age of 54 years, as well as sixteen pre-frail and thirteen frail patients with mean ages of 78 and 85 years, respectively, performed the 30 -s CST while threir trunk movements were measured by a sensor-unit at vertebra L 3. Sit-stand-sit cycles were determined using both acceleration and orientation information to detect failed attempts. Movement-related phases (i. e. impulse, stand-up, and sit-down) were differentiated based on seat off and seat on events. Finally, the kinematic parameters of the impulse, stand-up and sit-down phases were obtained to identify potential differences across the three frailty groups. Results: For the stand-up and sit-down phases, velocity peaks and “modified impulse” parameters clearly differentiated subjects with different frailty levels (p < 0. 001). The trunk <b>orientation</b> <b>range</b> during the impulse phase was also able to classify a subject according to his frail syndrome (p < 0. 001). Furthermore, these parameters derived from the inertial units (IUs) are sensitive enough to detect frailty differences not registered by the number of completed cycles which is the standard test outcome. Conclusions: This study shows that IUs can enhance the information gained from tests currently used in clinical practice, such as the 30 -s CST. Parameters such as velocity peaks, impulse, and <b>orientation</b> <b>range</b> are able to differentiate between adults and older populations with different frailty levels. This study indicates that early frailty detection could be possible in clinical environments, and the subsequent interventions to correct these disabilities could be prescribed before further degradation occurs.

40|$|AbstractThe biaxial {{deformation}} of a ferritic sheet steel has been examined using high energy in situ X-ray diffraction. A purpose built biaxial loading mechanism was constructed to enable deformation {{across a wide}} range of strain ratios. Three nominal deformation conditions were compared: (1) uniaxial loading, ∊TD/∊RD=-ν, (2) biaxial deformation where ∊TD/∊RD= 0. 4, and (3) approximately balanced biaxial deformation, with ∊TD/∊RD= 1. 5. This novel setup allowed the full Debye–Scherrer diffraction rings to be acquired during arbitrary selected strain-paths, permitting lattice strains and reflection intensities to be measured across an unrivalled grain <b>orientation</b> <b>range</b> for such deformation conditions. This experiment reveals that the accumulation of lattice strain during deformation, as a function of azimuthal angle, is highly sensitive to strain path. For the ∊TD/∊RD= 1. 5 strain path, whilst lattice strain accumulates most rapidly in the ∊TD direction during early stages of plastic deformation, the lattice strain is shown to distribute almost perfectly isotropically for the observed orientations when plastic strain is high. This was found to be in contrast to strain paths where ∊TD/∊RD≪ 1. 5, demonstrating that lattice strain magnitudes remain highest in the direction parallel to the tensile axis with the highest applied load. Furthermore, the technique provides the capability to observe the evolution of texture fibres via changes in reflection intensity during different applied strain ratios...|$|E
