5|$|F-16C/D: The F-16C (single seat) and F-16D (two seat) {{variants}} entered {{production in}} 1984. The first C/D version was the Block 25 with improved cockpit avionics and radar which added all-weather capability with beyond-visual-range (BVR) AIM-7 and AIM-120 air-air missiles. Block 30/32, 40/42, and 50/52 were later C/D versions. The F-16C/D had a unit cost of US$18.8million (1998). <b>Operational</b> <b>cost</b> per flight hour {{has been estimated}} at $7,000 to $22,470 or $24,000, depending on calculation method.|$|E
5|$|Proposals {{to simplify}} the fare {{structure}} abound. A flat fare that disregards distance has been proposed, or simpler fare bands or zones. Either scheme would shift the fare-box recovery burden to the urban riders in San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley and away from suburban riders in East Contra Costa, Southern Alameda, and San Mateo Counties, where density is lowest, and consequently, <b>operational</b> <b>cost</b> is highest.|$|E
5|$|After the 1904 elections, the new provincial {{governments of}} Alberta and Saskatchewan {{announced}} {{their desire to}} take on similar responsibilities {{to those in the}} eastern provinces, but showed no sign of actually establishing provincial police forces of their own. Finally, Laurier proposed in 1905 that the mounted police should remain in the new provinces, under contract to the provincial authorities for $75,000 per year apiece – about one-third of the actual <b>operational</b> <b>cost</b> – a solution which was approved by both sides. The workload on the police grew quickly as a consequence, with the criminal cases being handled almost trebling between 1905 and 1912 to over 13,000. Despite complaints from Commissioner Perry, the government refused to increase the establishment of the mounted police. By 1913, the provinces were expressing dissatisfaction about the service being delivered, and Saskatchewan indicated its intention not to renew the contract in 1916.|$|E

40|$|Adding {{wind power}} {{generation}} {{in a power}} system changes the operational patterns of the existing units due to the variability and unpredictability of wind power production. For large amounts of wind power production the expectation is that the <b>operational</b> <b>costs</b> of the other power plants will increase due to more operation time in part-load and more start-ups. The change in <b>operational</b> <b>costs</b> induced by the wind power production can only be calculated by comparing the <b>operational</b> <b>costs</b> in two power system configurations: with wind power production and with alternative production having properties like conventional production, i. e. being predictable and less variable. The choice {{of the characteristics of}} the alternative production is not straight forward and will therefore influence the <b>operational</b> <b>costs</b> induced by wind power production. This paper presents a method for calculating the change in <b>operational</b> <b>costs</b> due to wind power production using a stochastic optimization model covering the power systems in Germany and the Nordic countries. Two cases of alternative production are used to calculate the change in <b>operational</b> <b>costs</b> namely perfectly predictable wind power production enabling calculation of the costs connected to unpredictability, and constant wind power production enabling calculation of the <b>operational</b> <b>costs</b> connected to variability of wind power production. A 2010 case with three different wind power production penetration levels is analysed in the paper. ...|$|R
30|$|Precautionary <b>costs,</b> <b>operational</b> <b>costs</b> and stock-out {{costs are}} closely related. When {{determining}} {{the level of}} precautionary measures, the <b>operational</b> and stock-out <b>costs</b> due to delays are taken into account. The more precautionary measures that are taken, the fewer the <b>operational</b> <b>costs</b> will be later on. However, once precautionary measures are fixed, <b>operational</b> and stock-out <b>costs</b> arise for every delay that occurs (for the part of delay costs {{not covered by the}} precautionary measures).|$|R
5|$|In January 1942 it {{was decided}} that the limit of {{long-range}} aircraft endurance should be the crew’s limits, (due to extreme aircrew fatigue seriously effecting efficiency) not the fuel supply of the aircraft. De la Ferté decided, on 7 January, sorties should not exceed 14 hours, which reduced flying hours by four per mission. This was despite the entry of the very long-range Liberators in June 1941. The Liberator Mk I had a stated Air Ministry range of 2,720 miles, but crew endurance methods now meant it would be airborne for just 2,240. De la Ferté wrote to the Ministry arguing the Liberator should be used for reconnaissance work, rather than bomb load for the solitary squadron being accepted at that time. The Liberator would assist in closing the 'Mid-Atlantic Gap' which U-boats could operate in without worrying about air interdiction. After replacing Bowhill in 1941, de la Ferté had issued a directive on 12 June 1941 to use Wellingtons and Whitleys as an interim solution to unrestricted submarine warfare now practised by the Germans. Their uneconomical <b>operational</b> <b>cost</b> meant immediate replacement of these medium-range machines was pressing. Some Avro Lancasters and Halifaxes, with some difficulty, were seconded from Bomber Command.|$|E

25|$|The annual {{operational}} budget {{in fiscal year}} 2006 was 115.5 million U.S. dollars, down 16.1 million U.S. dollars from the previous year. Though operation under the fiscal year 2006 federal budget cut was uncertain, a key portion of the <b>operational</b> <b>cost</b> (13 million U.S. dollars) was contributed privately by a group close to Renaissance Technologies of East Setauket, New York.|$|E

25|$|Customers {{under such}} tariffs could see {{significant}} savings by being careful {{about when the}} vehicle was charged, for example, by using a timer to restrict charging to off-peak hours. Thus, an accurate comparison of the benefit requires each household to evaluate its current electrical usage tier and tariffs weighed against the cost of gasoline and the actual observed <b>operational</b> <b>cost</b> of electric mode vehicle operation.|$|E
25|$|When {{initially}} {{faced with}} this realization, President Eisenhower asked ARPA to consider alternative concepts. Their Project Defender studied all sorts of systems, before abandoning most of them to concentrate on Project BAMBI. BAMBI used a series of satellites carrying interceptor missiles that would attack the Soviet ICBMs shortly after launch. This boost phase intercept rendered MIRV impotent; a successful attack would destroy all of the warheads. Unfortunately, the <b>operational</b> <b>cost</b> of such a system would be enormous, and the US Air Force continually rejected such concepts. Development was cancelled in 1963.|$|E
25|$|The {{project cost}} around $90 million, with $5 million donated each by Jordan, Israel, Turkey, Iran and the European Union. The rest was donated by CERN from {{existing}} equipment. Jordan became the greatest {{contributor to the}} project by donating land and building construction costs, and by pledging to build a $7 million solar power plant, which will make SESAME the first accelerator {{in the world to}} be powered by renewable energy. The annual <b>operational</b> <b>cost</b> of $6 million are pledged by the members according to the size of their economies.|$|E

25|$|The Solar Water Purifier, {{developed}} and manufactured by an Australian company, is a low-maintenance, low <b>operational</b> <b>cost</b> solution that {{is able to}} purify large amounts of water, even seawater, to levels better than human consumption standards set by the World Health Organization. This device works through the processes of evaporation and UV radiation. Light passes through {{the top layer of}} glass to the black plastic layer underneath. Heat from the solar radiation is trapped by the water and by the black plastic. This plastic layer is a series of connected troughs that separate the water as it evaporates and trickles down through the levels. The water is also subjected to UV radiation {{for an extended period of}} time as it moves through the device, which kills many bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. In a sunny, equatorial area like much of Africa, this device is capable of purifying up to 45 litres per day from a single array. Additional arrays may be chained together for more capacity.|$|E
25|$|Rather ill-fated was the {{adoption}} of diesel services. In 2001, a total of 20 units were commissioned for use on the Dresden-Munich and Munich-Zurich lines, but these class 605 (ICE-TD) units experienced trouble from the start so the trains were mothballed. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, they were used for supplemental services. Their top speed is 125mph (200km/h). They are expensive to use within Germany since full diesel tax must be paid. Starting {{at the end of}} 2007, the class 605 has been deployed on the Hamburg-Copenhagen route. This route, using the Fehmarn Belt train ferry needs diesel trains for both the railway and the ferry, as neither has an electric supply. Later the Hamburg-Aarhus started to use these trains. The Danish railway currently has a severe shortage of long-distance diesel trains since their new IC4, with features similar to the ICE-TD, has also been ill-fated and severely delayed in delivery. The ICE-TD can have lower <b>operational</b> <b>cost</b> for this traffic, since diesel for train usage has lower tax in Denmark, and the trains fill their tanks there.|$|E
500|$|The Gripen's cost {{has been}} subject to {{frequent}} attention and speculation. In 2008, Saab announced reduced earnings for that year, partly attributing this to increased marketing costs for the aircraft. In 2008, Saab disputed Norway's cost calculations for the Gripen NG as overestimated and in excess of real world performance with existing operators. [...] A 2007 report by the European Union Institute for Security Studies stated the total research and development costs of Gripen were €1.84 billion. [...] According {{to a study by}} Jane's Information Group in 2012, the Gripen's <b>operational</b> <b>cost</b> was the lowest among several modern fighters; it was estimated at $4,700 per flight hour. [...] The Swedish Ministry of Defense estimated the cost of the full system, comprising 60 Gripen E/F, at SEK 90 billion distributed over the period 2013–42. [...] The Swedish Armed Forces estimated that maintaining 100 C/D-model aircraft until 2042 would cost SEK 60 billion, while buying aircraft from a foreign supplier would cost SEK 110 billion.|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{marginal}} {{cost of electricity}} varies because of the varying operational and fuel costs of different classes of generators. At one extreme, base load power plants such as coal-fired power plants and nuclear power plants are low marginal cost generators, as they have high capital and maintenance costs but low fuel costs. At the other extreme, peaking power plants such as gas turbine natural gas plants burn expensive fuel but are cheaper to build, operate and maintain. To minimize the total <b>operational</b> <b>cost</b> of generating power, base load generators are dispatched most of the time, while peak power generators are dispatched only when necessary, generally when energy demand peaks. [...] This is called [...] "economic dispatch".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the year}} 2014, [...] IPPs are {{offering}} to sell solar power below 5.50 Rs/kWh to feed {{into the high}} voltage grid. This price is below the affordable electricity tariff for the solar power to replace LPG and Kerosene use (after including subsidy on LPG & Kerosene) in domestic sector. Two wheelers and three wheelers consume 62% and 6% of petrol respectively in India. [...] The saved LPG/Autogas replaced by electricity in domestic sector {{can be used by}} two and three wheelers with <b>operational</b> <b>cost</b> and least pollution benefits. By the middle of 2016, LPG spot prices have fallen below crude oil parity price in terms of heat content (one barrel crude oil is equal to 123.5kg of LPG) due to LPG glut in the market Instead of using LPG as heating fuel in domestic sector, for higher end usage, LPG can be also converted into alkylate which is a premium gasoline blending stock because it has exceptional antiknock properties and gives clean burning.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{financial}} year 2012–13, {{the production of}} crude oil is 37.86 million tons and 40,679 million standard cubic meters (nearly 26.85 million tons) natural gas. The net import of crude oil [...] & petroleum products is 146.70 million tons worth of Rs 5611.40 billions. This includes 9.534 million tons of LNG imports worth of Rs. 282.15 billions. Internationally, LNG price [...] (One mmBtu of LNG = 0.1724 barrels of crude oil (boe) = 24.36 cubic meters of natural gas = 29.2 litres diesel = 21.3 kg LPG) is fixed below crude oil price in terms of heating value. LNG is slowly gaining its role as direct use fuel in road [...] and marine transport without regasification. By the end of June 2016, LNG price has fallen by nearly 50% below its oil parity price making it more economical fuel than diesel/gas oil in transport sector. [...] In 2012-13, India consumed 15.744 million tons petrol and 69.179 million tons diesel which are mainly produced from imported crude oil at huge foreign exchange out go. Use of natural gas [...] for heating, cooking and electricity generation is not economical {{as more and more}} locally produced natural gas will be converted into LNG for use in transport sector to reduce crude oil imports. In addition to the conventional natural gas production, coal gasification, coal bed methane, coal mine methane and Biogas digesters / Renewable natural gas will also become source of LNG forming decentralised base for production of LNG to cater to the widely distributed demand. There is possibility to convert most of the heavy duty vehicles [...] (including diesel driven rail engines) into [...] LNG fuelled vehicles to reduce diesel consumption drastically with <b>operational</b> <b>cost</b> and least pollution benefits. Also, the break even price at user end for switching from imported coal to LNG in electricity generation is estimated near 6 US$/mmBtu. The advent of cheaper marine CNG transport will restrict LNG use in high end transport sector to replace costly liquid fuels leaving imported CNG use for other needs. As the marine CNG transport is economical for medium distance transport and has fast unloading flexibility at many ports without costly unloading facilities, they have become alternate solution to submarine gas pipelines.|$|E
