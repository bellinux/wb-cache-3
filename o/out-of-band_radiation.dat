To design a successful OFDM based overlay systems, {{it is important to}} reduce the sidelobes in OFDM systems. In this paper we consider three approaches: Subcarrier weighting (SW) which is based on the multiplication of the used subcarriers with real-valued weighting factors, second approach we consider is multiple choice sequence (MCS) which is based on producing set of sequences and selecting the one sequence which has lowest power in sidelobes and third approach we consider is the conventional windowing of OFDM signal in time domain. We combine MCS with windowing technique and SW with windowing technique. Simulation results show that by combining MCS with windowing technique and SW with windowing technique, the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>radiations</b> in OFDM system can be significantly suppressed.

These special carriers are modulated with complex weighting factors which are optimized such that the sidelobes of the CCs cancel the sidelobes of the transmit signal.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{disadvantages}} of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is its large peak-to-average power ratio (PAR). In case of nonlinear power amplification this fact causes undesired <b>out-of-band</b> <b>radiation.</b> In this paper PAR reduction schemes for multiple-antenna OFDM, in particular variants of selected mapping (SLM), are considered. Directed SLM (dSLM), where a joint PAR reduction over the antennas is performed, is reviewed and compared to the obvious application of SLM to each single antenna (oSLM). Due to the avoidance of the signal peaks, less <b>out-of-band</b> <b>radiation</b> is caused. It is shown that both, oSLM and dSLM, provide significant gains in {{the reduction of the}} <b>out-of-band</b> <b>radiation</b> compared to conventional OFDM.

40|$|Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) {{is one of}} the best candidates for dynamic spectrum access due to its flexibility of spectrum shaping. However, the high sidelobes of the OFDM signal that result in high <b>out-of-band</b> <b>radiation,</b> introduce significant interference to the users operating in its vicinity. This problem becomes more critical in cognitive radio (CR) system that enables the secondary users (SUs) users to access the spectrum holes not used by the primary users (PUs) at that time. In this paper, we present a generalized OFDM framework that has a capability of describing any sidelobe suppression techniques, despite of whether one or a number of techniques are used. Based on that framework, we propose cancellation carrier (CC) technique in conjunction with the generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) to reduce the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>radiation</b> in the region where the licensed users are operating.

40|$|The spatial {{characteristics}} of the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>radiation</b> that a multiuser MIMO system emits, due to its power amplifiers (modeled by a polynomial model) being nonlinear, are studied by deriving an analytical expression for the continuous-time cross-correlation of the transmit signals. It is shown that, at any spatial point and on any frequency, the received power averaged over many channel realizations from a MIMO base station {{is the same as}} from a SISO base station when the two radiate the same amount of power. For a specific channel realization however, the received power can deviate from this average. We show that the deviations from the average are small in a MIMO system with multiple users and that the deviations can be significant with only one user. Using an ergodicity argument, we conclude that <b>out-of-band</b> <b>radiation</b> is less of a problem in massive MIMO, where precoding and array gain let us reduce the total radiated power compared to SISO systems.

One of these issues is the shape of the NC-OFDM spectrum outside of the intended transmission bandwidth, which is known to be relatively high when left untreated due to the Sinc pulse shapes of the individual data-bearing subcarriers. Consequently, if PU transmissions are located next to a collection of data-bearing subcarriers belonging to an NC-OFDM signal, this may result in the former experiencing an unacceptable level of interference from the latter.

40|$|The {{radiation}} {{pattern of the}} <b>out-of-band</b> (oob) <b>radiation</b> from large arrays with nonlinear hardware {{is different from the}} {{radiation pattern}} of the beamformed inband signal. This is the main difference between the oob radiation from large arrays and from well-studied legacy systems. Beamforming might focus the oob radiation in certain directions but also significantly reduce the total power that has to be transmitted. For cost and power-consumption reasons, large arrays might have to be built from low-complexity hardware without advanced precompensation for linearization, which increases the relative amount of oob radiation. Given that large arrays will be used in future base stations, a correct understanding of the oob radiation is crucial to specify appropriate linearity requirements for the hardware. We show that the oob radiation from large arrays varies little between coherence times; it is isotropic in many cases; and, when it is beamformed, it is directed towards the served user in a very narrow beam with an array gain equal to or less than that of the in-band signal. We draw the conclusion that, compared to legacy systems, less stringent linearity requirements can be used in many systems with large arrays by virtue of the lower transmit power needed to upkeep the same received signal-to-noise ratio...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a new matrix-based {{characterization}} of generalized-frequency-division-multiplexing (GFDM) transmitter matrices is proposed, {{as opposed to}} traditional vector-based characterization with prototype filters. The characterization facilitates deriving properties of GFDM (transmitter) matrices, including conditions for GFDM matrices being nonsingular and unitary, respectively. Using the new characterization, the necessary and sufficient conditions {{for the existence of}} a form of low-complexity implementation for a minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver are derived. Such an implementation exists under multipath channels if the GFDM transmitter matrix is selected to be unitary. For cases where this implementation does not exist, a low-complexity suboptimal MMSE receiver is proposed, with its performance approximating that of an MMSE receiver. The new characterization also enables derivations of optimal prototype filters in terms of minimizing receiver mean square error (MSE). They are found to correspond to the use of unitary GFDM matrices under many scenarios. The use of such optimal filters in GFDM systems does not cause the problem of noise enhancement, thereby demonstrating the same MSE performance as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. Moreover, we find that GFDM matrices with a size of power of two are verified to exist in the class of unitary GFDM matrices. Finally, while the <b>out-of-band</b> (OOB) <b>radiation</b> performance of systems using a unitary GFDM matrix is not optimal in general, it is shown that the OOB radiation can be satisfactorily low if parameters in the new characterization are carefully chosen.
