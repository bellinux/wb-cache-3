5000|$|In {{perhaps its}} {{simplest}} implementation, a control table may sometimes be a <b>one-dimensional</b> <b>table</b> for directly translating a raw data value to a corresponding subroutine offset, index or pointer using {{the raw data}} value either directly as the index to the array, or by performing some basic arithmetic on the data beforehand. This can be achieved in constant time (without a linear search or binary search using a typical lookup table on an associative array). In most architectures, {{this can be accomplished}} in two or three machine instructions - without any comparisons or loops. The technique is known as a [...] "trivial hash function" [...] or, when used specifically for branch tables, [...] "double dispatch".For this to be feasible, the range of all possible values of the data needs to be small (e.g. an ASCII or EBCDIC character value which have a range of hexadecimal '00' - 'FF'. If the actual range is guaranteed to be smaller than this, the array can be truncated to less than 256 bytes).|$|E
50|$|Since an OpenType font {{may include}} {{thousands}} of glyphs, and consequently {{a huge number}} of pairs of characters that need kerning, OpenType fonts may have an elaborate system of tables and subtables, designed to minimize the overall storage space. (Kerning is treated as part of a broad range of new glyph positioning features which are stored in GPOS.) The system is based on the concept of glyph classes: instead of a <b>one-dimensional</b> <b>table</b> where each entry corresponds to a pair of characters, there are two-dimensional tables where each entry corresponds to a pair of classes of glyphs. A class includes several characters whose right-hand outline (and right side-bearing) is identical for kerning purposes, or several characters whose left-hand outline (and left side-bearing) is identical. All pairs of characters where the first one is from the first class and the second one is from the second class will require the same kerning value, so this value needs to be specified only once in the table. The rows in the two-dimensional table correspond to first-character classes, and the columns correspond to second-character classes. The kerning value for a given pair of characters is found in the table at the intersection of the classes to which they belong.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{additive}} decomposition of probability tables- tensor rank-one decomposition. The basic {{idea is to}} decompose a probability table {{into a series of}} tables, such that the table that is the sum of the series is equal to the original table. Each table in the series has the same domain as the original table but can be expressed as a product of <b>one-dimensional</b> <b>tables.</b> Entries in tables are allowed to be any real number, i. e. they can be also negative numbers. The possibility of having negative numbers, in contrary to a multiplicative decomposition, opens new possibilities for a compact representation of probability tables. We show that tensor rank-one decomposition can be used to reduce the space and time requirements in probabilistic inference. We provide a closed form solution for minimal tensor rank-one decomposition for some special tables and propose a numerical algorithm {{that can be used in}} cases when the closed form solution is not known. ...|$|R

For higher intensity shaking, (PGA up to 0. 40 g) there was a significant transformation in response with much greater cyclic shear strain (0. 65 percent) and settlement (3. 1 percent). Other deposits were reinforced by use of Titan 26 - 14 self-drilling micropiles installed at 30 degrees inclination. Reinforcement by one inclined micropile was found to have little effect on response to shaking but installation of two diagonally opposed, inclined micropiles was found to reduce cyclic shear strain by half and settlement to one fifth that of similar un-reinforced deposits. ...|$|R

40|$|Twomey's seminal 1959 paper {{provided}} {{lower and}} upper bound approximations to {{the estimation of}} peak supersaturation within an updraft and thus provides the first closed expression {{for the number of}} nucleated cloud droplets. The form of this approximation is simple, but provides a surprisingly good estimate and has subsequently been employed in more sophisticated treatments of nucleation parametrization.

In order to make full use of this improved approximation, the underlying integro-differential equation for supersaturation evolution and the condition for calculating peak supersaturation are examined.

The system is composed of one-dimensional laminar box, cone penetration system, soil model, system for hydraulic soil pumping to achieve loose soil deposit, instrumentation and associated testing hardware. In order to simulate the free-field conditions in the laboratory, the laminates slide on each other using rollers placed between each laminate. The static calibration test results demonstrate that the friction effects between the laminates and the rollers are satisfactorily low. The loosest and the most liquefiable sand deposit is prepared inside the laminar box by hydraulic filling process and subjected to four subsequent shaking tests at different intensities. First, the laminar box and shake table performance is verified by using time-histories of acceleration and displacement test results. Then, the measured data inside the soil and on the laminates are compared with the numerical model. The previously calibrated numerical model UBCSAND which shows the seismic loading conditions in the free field is used in the simulations.

40|$|Security {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} and natural needs of humans. It has both objective and subjective-psychological dimensions. In this study, its subjective dimension (feeling of security) is considered. Sense of security as a socio-psychological phenomenon is influenced by the direct or indirect experiences of people in different social situations and people need it to achieve a healthy life and sustain social relationships. Feeling of security may not be obtainable at the same level for different classes of society and certain segments of society may feel less secure than the others. In other words, they see their own interests at risk more than the others. Crime prevention in specific meaning of Delinquency Prevention consists of a set of non-coercive measures designed to achieve a particular purpose, i. e. inhibition of crime, reducing crime, and reducing the severity of the offense. Social security feeling is a manifestation of the efforts of systems for prevention of social insecurity and anarchy to manage a healthy society. The main objective {{of this study is to}} examine the feeling of security among the youth in Broujerd. It is measured in terms of the effect of non-criminal prevention methods on the level of social security feeling. In the first section of this study, theoretical background and the related literatures are reviewed. In the next section the collected are presented from the target statistical population by using questionnaires. Then data are examined to verify if the lack of security feeling is really caused by the lack of security or some other reasons can contribute to feeling of security? What are the factors influencing this feeling? Then some non-criminal methods for prevention of offenses leading to insecurity feeling among young in Broujerd are proposed.     Materials and Methods   In this study, the study population included all 14 - 29 years old people living in the city of Broujerd. Based on the definition of national youth organization, people in this age group are considered as young. Their number according to the last census conducted by the Statistics Centre is equal to 117269. Due to the nature and extent of the statistical population, the method of random sampling was used. According to Cochran formula, 384 questionnaires were used to assess respondents' views. Considering the measurement of the variables, the statistics data were appropriately analyzed. Extraction, coding and analysis of data and preparation of tables and diagrams were performed using Excel and SPSS software. In describing the data, descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution (<b>one-dimensional</b> <b>tables</b> and charts) were used. For data analysis, inferential statistics and statistics tests (such as two-dimensional tables and correlation intensity tests appropriate to research questions and considering the measurement of variables) were used. The main hypothesis of the research is that developing and implementing the non-criminal prevention programs plays an important role in the social and environmental security and increases the security feeling of citizens by eliminating the root causes of crimes.     Discussion of Results and Conclusions   According to the results, it can be concluded that identifying and controlling factors that cause crime and insecurity is more effective than any other measure which is taken to keep the community in comfort. To achieve this important goal, promoting religious beliefs as well as the use of strategies to support individuals and families, besides the activities of the police and the judicial system can be very effective in controlling crime and increasing the sense of security in society. The results indicate that people have a positive view about the non-criminal crime prevention programs and they think that these measures have a very positive impact on the environmental and social health and security of the people. Among the personal characteristics such as gender, marital status, place of residence, age and educational level, only two variables-gender and marital status- were effective and in significant relationship with the security feeling of the individuals. The rest of the hypotheses were rejected. According to the research findings, the feeling of calm (in general) in Broujerd is moderate and in regard to calm feeling level in its different districts, responses indicate that this level is moderate to high. This difference suggests that the feeling of security among urban population is less than residential areas in Broujerd. In other words, the results suggest that respondents have a greater sense of insecurity and fear in the areas outside their residential region. In relation to the impact of each factor in prevention of crime and insecurity, strengthening the religious culture and expansion of “encouraging the good and discouraging the wrong” have higher ranks in the responses obtained from people. The lowest rank is for police activity in public places. Results show that the proportion of people who think that non-criminal prevention programs are effective in making a healthy social environment and increase the sense of security by identifying and removing the root causes of crime, is higher than the average.     Keywords : Security, Sense of Security, Social Security, Prevention of Non penal, Criminology...|$|R
