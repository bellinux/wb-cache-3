5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Rocky Schenck and was released on 28 April 1997. It features Barlow performing the song in France, walking down a highway littered with stage props and crew members actively changing the scenes as he walks forward. As he performs the chorus, he jumps <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> and walks towards his stage chair, where he sits and observes his surroundings. The video ends with Barlow running away from a woman down a country road, as the video fades from view.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} aspect {{that led}} to disagreement amongst {{the cast and crew}} was the genuine killing of animals. Kerman stormed <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> while the death of the coatimundi was filmed, and Yorke refused to participate in the killing of a pig, which he was originally scripted to execute, leaving the duty to Luca Barbareschi. When it was shot, the squeal of the pig subsequently caused Yorke to botch a long monologue, and retakes were not an option because they had no access to additional pigs. Perry Pirkanen cried after filming the butchering of a turtle, and crew members vomited off camera when a squirrel monkey was killed for the film. Actress Francesca Ciardi also objected to the film's sexual content {{and did not want to}} bare her breasts during the sex scene between her and Carl Yorke. When she refused to comply with Deodato's direction, he dragged her <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> and screamed at her in Italian. She had earlier suggested that she and Yorke actually have sex in the jungle before filming in order to relieve the tension of the upcoming scene. When Yorke declined, she grew upset with him, alienating him for the rest of the shoot.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{then shot}} the {{sequence}} where the Little Tramp first meets the millionaire and prevents him from committing suicide. During filming, Henry Clive suddenly {{decided that he}} did not want to jump into the tank of cold water in the scene, causing Chaplin to storm <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> and fire Clive. He was quickly replaced by Harry Myers, who Chaplin had known while under contract at Keystone Studios. Chaplin finished shooting the sequence on July 29, 1929 with exteriors at Pasadena Bridge. Chaplin then shot a sequence that was eventually cut from the film involving the Little Tramp attempting to retrieve a stick that was stuck in a wall. The scene included a young Charles Lederer; Chaplin later praised the scene, but insisted that it needed to be cut. He then continued filming the scenes with the millionaire until September 29, 1929.|$|E
50|$|The film {{is often}} {{considered}} as one of Spede's greatest, due to its human-story. It also features plenty of his zany comedy most of which takes place in Pasanen's character's fantasies (reflected <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> at which he is working).|$|R

5|$|Word about Barrymore's {{problems}} on and <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> {{spread around the}} industry, {{and he did not}} work on another film for over a year, when he had a supporting role in the musical film Maytime. His divorce from Costello was finalized in October 1936, and he married Barrie in November the same year. The couple had a heated argument in public shortly afterwards, and he again spent time in Kelley's Rest Home and hospital, which cost him an average of $800 daily, draining his finances. When he came out, he collapsed on the Maytime set. On January 15, 1937, he was served with divorce papers, and a month later he filed for bankruptcy protection, with debts of $160,000. The divorce was granted in April, but the couple reconciled before it was finalized.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1957, Stompanato visited Turner in England, where she was filming Another Time, Another Place (1958), co-starring Sean Connery. In her autobiography, Turner said that she {{arranged}} for Stompanato's visit because she was lonely and having a difficult time filming. Their reunion was initially happy, but the two soon began fighting. Stompanato became suspicious when Turner would not allow him to visit the set and, during one fight, he choked her, causing her to miss three weeks of filming. Turner later wrote {{that she and her}} makeup man, Del Armstrong, called Scotland Yard in order to have Stompanato deported. Stompanato got wind of the plan and showed up on the set with a gun, threatening her and her co-star Sean Connery, whom he warned to keep away from Turner. Connery answered by grabbing the gun out of Stompanato's hand and twisting his wrist, causing him to run <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> sheepishly. Turner and Armstrong later returned with two Scotland Yard detectives to the rented house where she and Stompanato were staying. The detectives advised Stompanato to leave and escorted {{him out of the house}} and also to the airport, where he boarded a plane back to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Stromberg demanded {{complete}} authenticity in casting, language, and {{the depiction}} of Eskimo life. Casting was critical. Van Dyke cast Inupiat natives (most of them from Barrow, Alaska) for all the minor roles, but Stromberg was so insistent on finding the perfect male lead that casting the title role of Mala/Kripik proved difficult. MGM wanted Ray Wise, the actor and cameraman (who later {{changed his name to}} Ray Mala), as the star of the picture, and he would become Alaska's first movie star. Wise was a half-Inupiat, half-Russian Jew who previously starred in the 1932 documentary film Igloo. Van Dyke wanted an all-native cast, not a half-native lead, and rejected Wise. A young native Alaskan was hired for the role, but he walked <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> in July 1932 when the stress of filming proved too great. Already on location in Alaska and isolated from the studio, Van Dyke turned to Ray Wise. Not only could Wise perform his own stunts, but Stromberg praised him as an immensely realistic actor. Wise came to Hollywood in 1925, and in addition to his work on Igloo was working as an assistant cameraman. He was hired as a guide for Eskimo's production to Alaska, and was able to offer his services to the film when the original actor quit. Although the film's credits state that professional actors were used only for the Canadian police roles, in fact the major female roles were played by professional actresses Lotus Long and Lulu Wong Ying. Numerous minor roles are also clearly filled by trained actors in make-up and costume.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, Malcolm McLaren hired Meyer {{to direct}} a film {{starring}} The Sex Pistols. Meyer handed the scriptwriting duties over to Ebert, who, in collaboration with McLaren, produced a screenplay entitled Who Killed Bambi? According to Ebert, filming ended after {{a day and a}} half when the electricians walked <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> after McLaren was unable to pay them. (McLaren has claimed that the project was scrapped at the behest of the main financier and Meyer's erstwhile employer, 20th Century Fox, whose board of directors considered the prospect of a Meyer production to be untenable and incompatible with the insurgent family values ethos in popular culture.) The project ultimately evolved into The Great Rock & Roll Swindle.|$|E
25|$|Unlike these earlier shows, Moonlighting {{sometimes}} {{broke the}} fourth wall {{in much more}} involved and complex ways. Cold opens sometimes featured Shepherd and Willis (in character as Maddie Hayes and David Addison), other actors, viewers, or TV critics directly addressing the audience about the show's production itself. These cold opens were originally born out of desperation {{as a way to}} fill air time, since the dialogue on the show was spoken so quickly and the producers needed something to fill the entire hour. In some other episodes, the plot suddenly changed into extended sequences that involved crew dismantling or changing the sets, characters wandering <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> into other parts of the studio, production crew stepping into the scene as a deus ex machina (e.g. a propmaster suddenly walking into the scene and taking the villain's gun away), or guest actors dropping character and referring to each other by their real names. However, other than in stand-alone openings, the main actors never stepped out of character during the episodes.|$|E

25|$|During 1959, Bava {{had assumed}} the directorial {{assignment}} of The Giant of Marathon from Jacques Tourneur, {{who left the}} production before {{most of the major}} sequences had been filmed. Bava, who had been that film's cinematographer, completed the film quickly and efficiently. This {{was not the first time}} Bava had been able to save a troubled movie for Marathons production company, Galatea Film. During that same year, Bava had performed a similar salvage job on Caltiki – The Immortal Monster (1959), replacing Riccardo Freda as director after he had abandoned the picture in the middle of production. Even earlier, he had assumed the directorial role for I Vampiri (1957) after the temperamental Freda had also walked <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> of that film after only a few days. Bava did not receive director screen credit for any of his work on the three troubled Galatea films. After Bava completed Marathon, Nello Santi, the head of Galatea Film, subsequently offered him his choice of any property for his first directorial effort.|$|E

500|$|Financed by EMI Films, Tender Mercies {{was shot}} largely in Waxahachie, Texas. The script was {{rejected}} by several American directors before the Australian Beresford accepted it. Duvall, who sang his own songs in the film, drove more than [...] throughout the state, tape recording local accents and playing in country music bands {{to prepare for the}} role.

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} between November 2 and December 23, 1981. The plants used in the gardening scenes were brought inside at night {{to keep them from}} freezing. Due to the tight schedule, the cast and crew worked seven days a week with very long hours each day. Although the Australian filmmakers and the crew, who were mostly from Dallas, got along very well both on and <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>set,</b> Beresford and Duvall were at odds during the production. Beresford, in his usual approach, meticulously planned each scene, and Duvall, who preferred a free-form give-and-take on set, felt restricted by the director's methods. Although Duvall regularly acknowledged his talent as a director, he said of Beresford, [...] "He has this dictatorial way of doing things with me that just doesn't cut it. Man, I have to have my freedom." [...] Although he had no problem with Duvall's acting methodology, the actor's temperament infuriated Beresford. While filming one scene with Harper and Barkin, he became so frustrated during a phone conversation with Duvall that he said, [...] "Well if you want to direct the film, go right ahead," [...] and walked <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>set.</b> Beresford flew to New York and reportedly was ready to quit, until Duvall flew out to speak with him.
