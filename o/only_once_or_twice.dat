5|$|The {{avifauna}} of Puerto Rico {{is composed}} of 349 species, 18 of which are endemic to the archipelago. Almost half of the species (166) are accidental, meaning {{that they have been}} sighted <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice,</b> and 42 of the species have been introduced, either directly or indirectly (mainly through habitat alteration), by humans. Approximately 120 species, including both native and introduced, breed regularly in the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|The {{lyrics of}} the Epistles {{describe}} {{a gallery of}} fictional and semi-fictional characters who take part in more or less real events {{in and around the}} Stockholm of Bellman's time. This cast includes some 44 named personages, many of whom appear <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice.</b> Some, like the principal characters Jean Fredman and Ulla Winblad, are based on real people, and in Fredman's case his real name was used. The Fredman of the Epistles is an alcoholic former watchmaker, and is the central character and fictional narrator. He is thus supposedly present in all the Epistles, but is only named in a few of them. The backdrop of many of the Epistles, Stockholm's taverns, is also frequented by musicians including Christian Wingmark on flute, Father Berg on various instruments, Father Movitz, and the dance master Corporal Mollberg.|$|E

5|$|In early 2000, Croatia and Serbia {{set up a}} {{commission}} tasked with determining the border, but in its first ten years it convened <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice.</b> Since 2010, the issue has gained increasing prominence in the disputing countries. Plans for construction of a port in Apatin, {{on a piece of}} territory claimed by Croatia, added fuel to the dispute. After years of inactivity the inter-governmental commission established to identify and determine the border between Croatia and Serbia met in Zagreb in April 2010, only to conclude that there was a difference of opinions on the matter. Later that month, the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) proposed a National Assembly resolution which would require that Serbian officials resolve the dispute in compliance with the Serbian claim. Months later, Radoslav Stojanović, a former legal representative of Serbia and Montenegro in the Bosnian Genocide Case and former ambassador to the Netherlands, likened the dispute to the Croatia–Slovenia border dispute in the Gulf of Piran. Stojanović said that the position held by Croatia in its dispute with Slovenia was favourable for Serbia and warned that Serbia might be in a disadvantageous position if Croatia joined the European Union (EU) before Serbia—which would allow it to impose its conditions to the process of accession of Serbia to the EU.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of urban areasin particular Antananarivohave been {{hardest hit by}} economic downturns and economic policy shifts. The national economic crisis in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and the World Bank's imposition of a structural adjustment program lowered living standards for the average resident of the city. The end of state subsidies, rapid inflation, higher taxes, widespread impoverishment {{and the decline of}} the middle class were especially evident in Antananarivo, as was the growing wealth of a tiny political and economic elite in the city. In 2007, two thirds of Antananarivo residents had access to electricity, while ten percent of households owned a scooter, car or other motor vehicle. Running water was installed in fewer than 25 percent of homes, small restaurants and businesses in 2007, necessitating the collection of water from household wells or neighborhood pumps and the use of outdoor pit toilets detached from the main building. In 2007, 60 percent of households were using shared public latrines. Most homes use charcoal for daily cooking; stocks of charcoal and rice are kept in the kitchen. The average city household spends just under half of its budget on food. Owing to its increasingly high cost, consumption of meat by city residents has sharply declined since the 1970s; the urban poor eat meat on holidays <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> a year.|$|E

25|$|The {{places around}} the Middle East most likely to see the winter variety lie near Lavan Island, Halul Island, and Ras Rakan.

25|$|An older snake may shed {{its skin}} <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> a year. But a younger snake, still growing, may shed {{up to four}} times a year. The {{discarded}} skin gives a perfect imprint of the scale pattern, and it is usually possible to identify the snake if the discarded skin is reasonably intact. This periodic renewal {{has led to the}} snake being a symbol of healing and medicine, as pictured in the Rod of Asclepius.|$|E

25|$|The {{ease with}} which an {{individual}} can acquire an amateur radio license varies from country to country. In some countries, examinations may be offered <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> {{a year in the}} national capital and can be inordinately bureaucratic (for example in India) or challenging because some amateurs must undergo difficult security approval (as in Iran). Currently only Yemen and North Korea do not issue amateur radio licenses to their citizens, although in both cases a limited number of foreign visitors have been permitted to obtain amateur licenses in the past decade. Some developing countries, especially those in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, require the payment of annual license fees that can be prohibitively expensive for most of their citizens. A few small countries may not have a national licensing process and may instead require prospective amateur radio operators to take the licensing examinations of a foreign country. In countries with the largest numbers of amateur radio licensees, such as Japan, the United States, Thailand, Canada, and most of the countries in Europe, there are frequent license examinations opportunities in major cities.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the International Skating Union {{enacted a}} rule stating that a skater may perform {{each type of}} triple <b>only</b> <b>once,</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> {{if one of them}} is {{incorporated}} into a combination or sequence. For a set of jumps to be considered a combination, each jump must take off from the landing edge of the previous jump, with no steps, turns, or change of edge in between jumps. Toe loops and loops are commonly performed as the second or third jump in a combination because they take off from the back outside edge of the landing foot, or skating leg. To perform a salchow or flip on the back end of a combination, a half loop (which is actually a full rotation, but lands on a back inside edge of the landing leg) may be used as a connecting jump. In contrast, jump sequences are sets of jumps which may be linked by non-listed jumps or hops. Sequences are worth 80% of what the same jumps executed in combination would be worth.|$|E

500|$|The stylistic device most {{commonly}} found in Wodehouse's work is his use of comparative imagery that includes similes. Hall opines that the humour comes from Wodehouse's ability to accentuate [...] "resemblances which at first glance seem highly incongruous". Examples {{can be seen in}} Joy in the Morning, Chapter 29: [...] "There was a sound in the background like a distant sheep coughing gently on a mountainside. Jeeves sailing into action", or Psmith, Chapter 7: [...] "A sound like two or three pigs feeding rather noisily {{in the middle of a}} thunderstorm interrupted his meditation." [...] Hall also identifies that periodically Wodehouse used the stylistic device of a transferred epithet, with an adjective that properly belongs to a person applied instead to some inanimate object. The form of expression is used sparingly by Wodehouse in comparison with other mechanisms, <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> in a story or novel, according to Hall.|$|E

5000|$|The plot {{suggests}} that many wartime publications of Timely Comics were in fact, in the Marvel Universe, published as propaganda of the US military.

For this reason many of the early Marvel/Timely characters <b>only</b> appeared <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> in Timely comic books.|$|R
