40|$|Biodiesel is {{a notable}} {{alternative}} to the widely used petroleum-derived diesel fuel since it can be generated by domestic natural sources such as soybeans, rapeseeds, coconuts, and even recycled cooking oil, and thus reduces dependence on diminishing petroleum fuel from foreign sources. The injection and atomization characteristics of the vegetable oils are significantly different than those of petroleum-derived diesel fuels, mainly {{as the result of}} their high viscosities. Modern diesel engines have fuel-injection system that is sensitive to viscosity change. One way to avoid these problems is to reduce fuel viscosity of vegetable oil in order to improve its performance. The conversion of vegetable oils into biodiesel is an effective way to overcome all the problems associated with the vegetable <b>oils.</b> <b>Dilution,</b> micro-emulsification, pyrolysis, and transesterification are the four techniques applied to solve the problems encountered with the high fuel viscosity. Transesterification is the most common method and leads to monoalkyl esters of vegetable oils and fats, now called biodiesel when used for fuel purposes. The methyl ester produced by transesterification of vegetable oil has a high cetane number, low viscosity and improved heating value compared to those of pure vegetable oil which results in shorter ignition delay and longer combustion duration and hence low particulate emissions.

Vacuum advance works by using a manifold vacuum source to advance the timing at low to mid engine load conditions by rotating the position sensor (contact points, hall effect or optical sensor, reluctor stator, etc.) mounting plate in the distributor {{with respect to the}} distributor shaft. Vacuum advance is diminished at wide open throttle (WOT), causing the timing advance to return to the base advance in addition to the mechanical advance.|$|E

Field tests were also conducted during two successive years, where fourth instar nymphs of the Tree Locust, Anacridium melanorhodon melanorhodon, were sprayed with Metarhizium, Metarhizium/ Neem mixture, Neem, or Malathion, on a plantation of Acacia senegal. Samples of the treated nymphs were taken 24 h after application, placed in cages and their mortality observed daily for 3 weeks. The compatibility test revealed that at 288 C, all Neem concentrations below 2 % were compatible with M. acridum and concentrations of 2 and 2. 5 % were moderately toxic, while at 208 C, 1. 0 % Neem was not compatible with the fungus.

By far the most common solvent for perfume <b>oil</b> <b>dilution</b> is ethanol or a mixture of ethanol and water. Perfume has a mixture of about 10-20% perfume oils mixed with alcohol (acting as a diffusing agent delivering the fragrant odor) and a trace of water. Colognes have about 3-5% perfume oil mixed with 80-90% alcohol with about 5 to 15 percent water in the mix. Originally, eau de cologne was a mixture of citrus oils from such fruits as lemons, oranges, tangerines, limes, and grapefruits. These were combined with such substances as lavender and neroli (orange-flower oil). Toilet water has the least amount of perfume oil mixture among the three main liquid [...] "perfumery" [...] categories. It has only about 2 to 8 percent of some type of perfume oil and 60-80% alcohol dispersent with water making up the difference.

The working principle of the LNT is based on its capability to store the NOx engine out during the normal lean (excess of Oxygen) phase operation condition of the Diesel engine. The NOx will be then reduced in a dedicated regeneration phase which consist in creating for relatively short time a rich exhaust gas condition inside the LNT.

The relatively low intake manifold temperatures and large amount of fuel injected make fuel impingement and <b>oil</b> <b>dilution</b> of particular interest in marine outboard engines. This project included the development of a rezoning subroutine, a single-component fuel study and multi-component fuel study using KIVA. Single-component studies of C 6 H 14, C 8 H 18, C 14 H 30 and C 8 H 17 (gasoline) gave an initial indication of the amount and location of fuel impingement. These results indicated a fuel-composition dependence of the fuel impingement process. ASTM D- 86 fuel distillation curves were used to create gasoline multicomponent fuel distributions. The results of the multi-component study showed that the mass-averaged mean molecular weight fuel increased during time, suggesting that the heavy components in the fuel would have significant impact on the fuel film. Additional single-component simulations were conducted with a fuel mass representative of the multi-component distribution to examine what effect heavier (C 9 H 20 and C 10 H 22) test fuels would have on the impingement process.

Its specific gravity is 0. 9313; with 1. 4526 as refractive index; + 4. 249 optical activity and ester value of 101. The chemical components of the oil identified via Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy consist of 5 -(2 -propenyl) - 1, 3 -benzodioxole, eugenol isomer and caryophyllene among others. The minimum effective concentration (MIC) of the oil was determined using <b>Dilution</b> method. The <b>oil</b> {{was found to have}} significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans and Trichophyton mentagrophytes with MIC values of: 125 µg/ml; 15. 60 µg/ml; 250 µg/ml and 195 µg/ml respectively. Antimicrobial activity was tested by agar diffusion method utilizing the same test organisms. The zones of growth inhibition measured to the nearest mm. were: 67. 50 mm for S. aureus; 90 mm for S. pyogenes, C. albicans and T. mentagrophytes.

30|$|High {{viscosity}} at reservoir {{conditions is}} a major setback to heavy crude oil and bitumen recovery and transportation via pipelines. Thus, blending or dilution of heavy crude oil and bitumen to reduce viscosity {{is one of the}} several means to improve transportation via pipelines that is a most commonly used technique in the petroleum industry since the 1930 s. The blending fluid or diluents is always less viscous than the heavy crude and bitumen. Generally, it well know that the lower the viscosity of the diluents, the lower is the viscosity of the blended mixture of heavy crude and bitumen (Gateau et al. 2004). The widely used diluents include condensate from natural gas production, naphtha, kerosene, lighter crude oils, etc. However, the use of organic solvents such as alcohol, methyl tert-butyl ether, tert-amyl methyl ether has been investigated (Anhorn and Badakhshan 1994). The use of these solvents is prompted based on their use in improving the octane number of gasoline. Subsequently, a mixture of hydrocarbons and organic solvents with polar group in their molecular structure has shown some effectiveness in viscosity reduction of heavy crude <b>oil</b> at constant <b>dilution</b> rate (Gateau et al. 2004). The use of diluents allows the transportation of large quantity or volume of heavy crude oil and bitumen.|$|R
