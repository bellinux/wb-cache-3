On the way, Death (voiced by Miguel Ferrer) appears to Simon in a vision, {{offering}} his one and <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> of escaping {{the curse of the}} crown. Simon refuses, and Betty attacks and eventually destroys Bella Noche. Simon reverts to Ice King, unaware of what happened. Later, he recounts the events to a captured Muscle Princess, while Betty—who survived the struggle with Bella Noche—watches sadly from a window and flies off on the magic carpet.|$|E

5|$|Just a {{week after}} {{defeating}} Williams, a rematch was announced between Dyer and Holland. The fight venue was Rushcutters Bay Stadium in Sydney and both fighters turned out for a training exhibition in the build-up to the contest. The contest, held on 5 June 1915, was watched by a crowd of 2,000 spectators. The fight went the full distance and in the closing rounds Holland, realising that his <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> of victory was a knockout, attacked Dyer ferociously, staggering the Welshman in the 19th. Despite the late assault, Dyer stayed on his feet and was announced the winner by the referee.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{had won the}} 1965–66 Football League, {{a victory}} over Chelsea F.C. ensured they became English champions. Their league success meant that {{whatever}} the result they would be competing in the European Cup the following season. Borussia Dortmund had finished as runners-up in the 1965–66 Fußball-Bundesliga, three points behind champions 1860 Munich. As Bayern Munich had won the 1965–66 DFB-Pokal, Dortmund's <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> of participating in European football the following season was to win the Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E
5|$|The Americans buried {{their dead}} and resumed the retreat, the Indians and British rangers {{pursuing}} and firing occasionally from at long range.

The Americans fell back more than , some on foot, before making camp. The next day, two American stragglers were captured and presumably killed before the Indians and rangers finally abandoned the chase. The main body of Americans reached Mingo Bottom on June 13. Many stragglers arrived in small groups for several days more. In all, about 70 Americans never returned from the expedition.|$|E

Boro gained two goals through {{defensive}} mistakes, with Tuncay converting them both, but they weren't the <b>only</b> <b>chances</b> they had, as Alves missed a sitter from three yards out. Villa levelled the game three minutes after Boro's first goal but the visitors won it 2–1 two minutes from the end of normal time.|$|R
5|$|Alexios {{deployed}} his smaller army {{in waiting}} near Bryennios's camp, and divided {{it in two}} commands. The left, which confronted Bryennios's strongest division, was commanded by himself and contained the Frankish knights {{to the right and}} the Immortals to the Franks' left. The right command was under Constantine Katakalon, and comprised the Chomatenoi and the Turks. The latter, according to the Alexiad, were given the role of flank guard (plagiophylakes) and tasked with observing and countering the Pechenegs. Conversely, on the extreme left Alexios formed his own flanking detachment (apparently drawn from among the Immortals), concealed from enemy view inside a hollow. Given his inferiority, Alexios was forced to remain on the defensive. His <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> at success was that his out-flankers, concealed by the broken terrain, would surprise and create enough confusion among Bryennios's men for him and his strong left wing to break through their lines.|$|E
5|$|As it {{had become}} evident that the Aouzou Strip was being used by Libya {{as a base for}} deeper {{involvement}} in Chad, Malloum decided to bring the issue of the Strip's occupation before the UN and the Organisation of African Unity. Malloum also decided he needed new allies; he negotiated a formal alliance with Habré, the Khartoum Accord, in September. This accord was kept secret until 22 January, when a Fundamental Charter was signed, following which a National Union Government was formed on 29 August 1978 with Habré as Prime Minister. The Malloum-Habré accord was actively promoted by Sudan and Saudi Arabia, both of which feared a radical Chad controlled by Gaddafi. The two nations saw in Habré, with his good Muslim and anti-colonialialist credentials, the <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> to thwart Gaddafi's plans.|$|E
5|$|Blazing Lazers, {{known as}} Gunhed in Japan, is a shoot 'em up video game {{developed}} by Hudson Soft and Compile. It {{was released in}} Japan and North America in 1989 for the TurboGrafx-16. It {{is based on the}} Japanese film Gunhed, and the references to the film were removed for the North American release. In the game, a fictional galaxy is under attack by an enemy space armada called the Dark Squadron, and this galaxy's <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> for survival is the Gunhed Advanced Star Fighter, who must destroy the Dark Squadron and its Super Weapons. The gameplay features fast vertical scrolling and a wide array of weapons for the player to use.|$|E

5|$|In a {{situation}} with more time, Virginia Tech would have kicked the ball off to Florida State and {{hoped for a}} defensive stop to give the offense {{a chance for a}} game-winning drive. With less than twominutes remaining, however, and with Virginia Tech having used all its timeouts, the <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> for the Hokies was to attempt a difficult onside kick. A successful recovery would give the Hokies another chance on offense. Kicker Brandon Pace teed up the ball, and kicked it forwards, bouncing the ball high into the air to create a jump ball situation. Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi recovered the ball, but because the kick had only traveled nineyards before the recovery, the ball was awarded to Florida State. NCAA rules state that an onside kick must travel at least 10yards before the kicking team can legally touch the ball, and Pace's kick had not traveled the requisite distance.|$|E
5|$|When World War II broke out, Shaw took a {{break from}} acting and joined the Royal Air Force. He was {{commissioned}} as an Acting-Pilot Officer on probation in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch on 25 April 1941 {{and over the next}} three months was promoted to Pilot Officer on probation, then Flying Officer and then Flight Lieutenant. According to his obituary in the Guardian, he saw little action in the service and was told the <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> he would have to fly would be as a rear gunner. Some of his fellow airmen hounded Shaw for autographs while others mocked his posh accent, to which he retaliated with an excellent and unflattering imitation of their less refined speech. He continued to hold a Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve commission after the war until he resigned the commission on 10 February 1954; he was permitted to retain his rank.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool had {{a chance}} to extend their lead in the 74th minute, but Gerrard was unable to score from a cross by Núñez, with his shot going wide of the Chelsea goal. Liverpool pressed forward and a sliding tackle from Chelsea captain John Terry {{prevented}} Baroš from shooting in the Chelsea penalty area. Chelsea were awarded a free-kick in the 79th minute which was taken by Ferreira, the ball was met by Gerrard who intended to head it clear, but scored an own goal after heading the ball into the Liverpool goal. The score was now 1–1. Chelsea made their final substitution following the goal, with Glen Johnson replacing Cole. Chelsea manager Mourinho was sent off following the goal for making a gesture towards the Liverpool fans. Chelsea nearly took the lead in the 82nd minute, but Duff's shot was saved by Dudek. Chelsea had a few chances to score in the following exchanges, but all the efforts missed the Liverpool goal. Liverpool's <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> {{in the rest of the}} half fell to Baroš, but he also put his shot wide. With the scores at 1–1, following the end of 90 minutes the match went to extra time.|$|E

These <b>only</b> <b>chanced</b> to be heard, indeed, or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis.|$|R
5|$|Of the {{approximately}} 20 German infantry and armoured divisions {{trapped in the}} Falaise pocket around 12 were still operating {{with a degree of}} combat-effectiveness. As these formations retreated eastwards they fought desperately to keep the jaws of the encirclement—formed by the Canadians in Trun and St. Lambert, and the Poles and Americans in Chambois—from closing. German movement out of the pocket throughout the night of 19 August cut off the Polish battlegroups on the Mont Ormel ridge. On discovering this Stefanowicz conferred with Koszutski. Lacking sufficient means to either seal the pocket or fight their way clear, the two decided that the <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> of survival for their force was to hold fast until relieved. Although the Polish soldiers on Point 262N could hear movement from the valley below, other than some mortar rounds that landed among the positions of the 8th Infantry Battalion the night passed uneventfully. Without possession of Point 262S the Poles were unable to interfere with the large numbers of German troops slipping past the southern slopes of the ridge. The uneven, wooded terrain, interspersed with thick hedgerows, made control of the ground to the west and southwest difficult by day and impossible by night. As it grew light on 20 August Szydłowski prepared to fulfil his orders of the previous day and organised two companies of his 9th Infantry Battalion, supported by the 1st Armoured Regiment, for an attack across the road towards Point 262S. However, hampered by the wreckage littering the pass the attack soon bogged down in the face of fierce German resistance.|$|E
5|$|The Crusader army under Goffredo {{is laying}} siege to Jerusalem, where the Saracen king Argante is {{confined}} with his troops. With Goffredo are his brother Eustazio, his daughter Almirena, and the knight Rinaldo. As Goffredo sings {{of the coming}} victory, Rinaldo declares his love for Almirena, and Goffredo confirms {{that she will be}} Rinaldo's bride when Jerusalem falls. Almirena urges Rinaldo to fight boldly and assure victory. As she departs, a herald announces the approach of Argante from the city. Eustazio surmises that the king fears defeat; this seems to be confirmed when Argante, after a grandiose entrance, requests a three-day truce to which Goffredo graciously assents. After Goffredo leaves, Argante ponders his love for Armida, the Queen of Damascus who is also a powerful sorceress, and considers the help her powers might bring him. As he muses, Armida arrives from the sky in a fiery chariot. She has divined that the Saracens' <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> of victory lies in vanquishing Rinaldo, and has the power, she claims, to achieve this.|$|E
