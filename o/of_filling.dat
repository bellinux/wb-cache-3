Pierce {{spent the first}} few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E
5|$|As the new-fangled Ford Model Ts {{and other}} early {{automobiles}} increasingly {{took to the}} roads in the 1920s, inland steamship lines in the U.S. initially resisted carrying automobiles on their boats. By the Depression-ravaged 1930s, however, the Old Bay Line {{became one of the}} first inland steamship companies to promote the carriage of automobiles as a means <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> its ships' empty cargo holds. The Depression and loss of business to improved highways took an increasing toll of many U.S. steamship lines in the 1930s, as historic companies such as the Fall River Line ceased operation in 1937, preceded by the Lake Champlain company, which was the oldest steamboat line in the U.S. at its demise in 1932.|$|E

40|$|High-yielding {{variety is}} one of the targets in soybean {{breeding}} program. High-yielding variety could be developed through simultaneous selection. Simultaneous selection using selection index was more efficient than selection based on an individual trait only. Objective of the research was to select agronomic characters for construction selection index on 11 soybean populations F 6 generation based on correlation analysis, path analysis, and heritability. The correlation analysis showed that number of branch, number of total nod, number <b>of</b> <b>filled</b> pod, number <b>of</b> unfilled pod, number of total pod, and percentage <b>of</b> <b>filled</b> pod have positively and significantly correlated with yield per plant. Based on path analysis, characters number of branch, number of unfilled pod, and number <b>of</b> <b>filled</b> pod have positive direct on yield per plant. The result also showed that number <b>of</b> <b>filled</b> pod has maximum positive direct effect on yield per plant.

However, in practical situations, these extruders operate under starved conditions. To overcome this missing {{link in the}} current models, this paper describes the average degree <b>of</b> <b>fill</b> in the situation of starvation.

5|$|The state {{constitution}} had come under considerable criticism {{beginning in the}} 1840s because it allowed most government positions to be filled by appointment. The problem with this method <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> positions did not manifest itself until {{the advent of the}} state's political parties. Once in power, a party could stack the government with its own members, making it difficult for the minority to regain power. Another problem was that the authority for many trivial issues were not delegated to other authorities. For example, if a man was to divorce his wife, the divorce bill had to be approved by the General Assembly before he or she could legally remarry.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1916, Stevens announced the policy that the CUWS had organized in twenty-two states and planned on recruiting delegates {{for each of the}} 435 House Districts. The delegates were required to form committees to press Congressional Members to favor suffrage and make them aware that their constituents were in favor of women attaining the vote. Another strategy Stevens began implementing early in 1916 required CUWS members to go to other states in which women were allowed to vote, establish residence and register to vote. In this way, they could vote in state and national elections in the hope <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> the legislature with legislators who favored suffrage. Stevens registered to vote in Kansas that year. On 5 June 1916, the CUWS became the National Woman's Party (NWP), having a single platform to acquire a constitutional amendment for national women's suffrage. After attending the NWP convention in Chicago in June, Stevens headed to a convention in Colorado. By October, Stevens was organizing and managing the NWP election campaign in California.|$|E
5|$|Civil service examinations: In the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), the xiaolian {{system of}} {{recruiting}} government officials through formal recommendations {{was the chief}} method <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> bureaucratic posts, although there was an Imperial Academy to train potential candidates for office and some offices required its candidates to pass formal written tests before appointment. However, {{it was not until}} the Sui Dynasty (581–618) that civil service examinations became open to all adult males not belonging to the merchant class (although having wealth or noble status were not requirements) and were used as a universal prerequisite for appointments to office, at least in theory. The civil service system was implemented on a much larger scale during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), when an elite core of dynastic-founding and professional families lost their majority in government to a broad strata of lesser gentry families from throughout the country.|$|E

40|$|In this study, I want to {{investigate}} the types <b>of</b> <b>filled</b> pauses used by the male university students and those used by the female students in answering questions. After that, I compare it to find the similarities and the differences. That is why I will use the theories about filled pauses, the relationship between filled pauses with gender and also the theory about questions itself. In doing this study, I employed a quantitative - descriptive approach. The data were obtained by recording the utterances of 40 (forty) male Petra Christian University students and 40 (forty) female Petra Christian University students. After the recording, I transcribed the data, identified, classified and finally analyzed it. From the findings, I found four similarities. Firstly, both groups (the males and the females) use the same five types <b>of</b> <b>filled</b> pauses which consists of 2 (two) Unlexicalized Filled Pauses (ehm [...] and ee/eh.) and 3 (three) Lexicalized Filled Pauses (yah/ya/yo, apa/apa ya/apa nama?e itu and gimana ya/ yak apa ya). Secondly, both the male and the female students mostly use the Unlexicalized Filled Pause. Thirdly, I found that ?ehm [...] . and [...] . yah [...] . /ya/yo are the types <b>of</b> <b>filled</b> pauses that most frequently used by both groups. Fourthly, in general, the production <b>of</b> <b>filled</b> pauses by both groups rises {{in line with the}} level of difficulty of the questions. However, not only similarities, I also found the difference. The females use more types <b>of</b> <b>filled</b> pauses compare to the males. The females use 6 types, while the males only use 5 types.

Reynolds resigned as a director in January 2004 with the club under threat of imminent closure. A benefit match, featuring footballers such as Gascoigne, Bryan Robson and Kenny Dalglish, played in front of a crowd of over 14,000, raised £100,000 to help ensure survival in the short term.

5|$|Luzzaschi's book of madrigals for one, two, {{and three}} sopranos with {{keyboard}} accompaniment, published in 1601, comprises works written throughout the 1580s. This music {{may have been}} kept back from publication {{in order to maintain}} the secrecy of Alfonso's musica secreta, and to maintain control over it. Newcomb considers this publication the exemplar of the ladies' signature musical style. In 1584, Alessandro Striggio, responding to requests from Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, described the ladies and composed pieces imitating their style so that Francesco could start his own concerto delle donne. Striggio mentioned an ornamented four voice madrigal for three sopranos and a dialogue with imitative diminutions for two sopranos. He added that he had forgotten the intabulation for the madrigal in Mantua, and noted that the skilled singer Giulio Caccini could play the bass part on either lute or harpsichord. This indicates both that male singers were probably not used after Brancaccio, and that instrumental accompaniments were a common and acceptable means <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> in the counterpoint.|$|E

He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers. Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats.; this was especially the case with policy making positions. While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.|$|E

Henry II and the Welsh prince Rhys ap Gruffydd later agreed peace terms, and the castle was rebuilt. The inside of the ringwork was partially filled by debris during the 1151 attack, and at some point in the next few decades the bank of the ringwork was also deliberately widened inwards in places, allowing buildings to be constructed on it. These changes started the process <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> in the middle of the ringwork which led to the castle today having a mound, or motte-like, appearance.|$|E
5|$|When pressurised, a {{cylinder}} carries an equivalent volume of free gas greater than its water capacity, because the gas is compressed {{up to several}} hundred times atmospheric pressure. The selection of an appropriate set of diving cylinders for a diving operation {{is based on the}} amount of gas required to safely complete the dive. Diving cylinders are most commonly filled with air, but because the main components of air can cause problems when breathed underwater at higher ambient pressure, divers may choose to breathe from cylinders filled with mixtures of gases other than air. Many jurisdictions have regulations that govern the filling, recording of contents, and labelling for diving cylinders. Periodic inspection and testing of cylinders is often obligatory {{to ensure the safety of}} operators <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> stations.

5|$|In September 1967, {{the first}} {{successful}} Roundabout recruitment was Curtis' flatmate, the classically trained Hammond organ player Jon Lord; he had most notably played with The Artwoods, a band led by Art Wood, brother of future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, and featuring Keef Hartley. At that time, Lord was playing in a band backing the successful pop vocalists The Flower Pot Men called The Garden, which also included bassist Nick Simper and drummer Carlo Little. Simper and Little were alerted by Lord of the Roundabout project and remained in standby for an eventual involvement. They recommended to Lord the guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, whose playing Chris Curtis had appreciated when his band The Searchers had played at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany. Blackmore {{had been a member}} of The Outlaws and had played as session and live musician with many beat, pop and rock acts, including Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages, where he had met Little. Curtis contacted Blackmore to audition for the new group and persuaded him to move from Hamburg, where he was hanging out in local clubs. The guitarist came back to England for good to join the group in December 1967. Meanwhile, Curtis' erratic behaviour and his sudden loss of interest in the project he had started slowed down any development, forcing his financiers, HEC Enterprises, to drop him and entrust Lord and Blackmore with the task <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> out the rest of the band.|$|E

5|$|Most paleontologists regard birds as {{the only}} {{surviving}} dinosaurs (see Origin of birds). It is thought that all non-avian theropods became extinct, including then-flourishing groups such as enantiornithines and hesperornithiforms. Several analyses of bird fossils show divergence of species prior to the K–Pg boundary, and that duck, chicken, and ratite bird relatives coexisted with non-avian dinosaurs. Large collections of bird fossils representing a range of different species provides definitive evidence for the persistence of archaic birds to within 300,000 years of the K–Pg boundary. The absence of these birds in the Paleogene is evidence that a mass extinction of archaic birds took place there. A {{small fraction of the}} Cretaceous bird species survived the impact, giving rise to today's birds. The only bird group known for certain to have survived the K–Pg boundary is the Aves. Avians may have been able to survive the extinction {{as a result of their}} abilities to dive, swim, or seek shelter in water and marshlands. Many species of avians can build burrows, or nest in tree holes or termite nests, all of which provided shelter from the environmental effects at the K–Pg boundary. Long-term survival past the boundary was assured as a result <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> ecological niches left empty by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs.|$|E
