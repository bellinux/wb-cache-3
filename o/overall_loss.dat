5|$|Another {{criticism}} {{pertains to}} the shift in training focus {{after the end of}} Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s, as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido. As a result, strikes to vital points by tori, entering (irimi) and initiation of techniques by tori, the distinction between omote (front side) and ura (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that lack of training in these areas leads to an <b>overall</b> <b>loss</b> of effectiveness.|$|E

The Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System equipment functioned as planned, processing several hundred times more material than would have been possible on Earth, and the Asahi Shimbun crystal experiment, flown for the second time, was able to produce snow crystals after the canister was redesigned.|$|E

25|$|A {{political}} fight {{which began}} as a conflict between the President and the Supreme Court turned into a battle between Roosevelt and the recalcitrant {{members of his own}} party in the Congress. The political consequences were wide-reaching, extending beyond the narrow question of judicial reform to implicate the political future of the New Deal itself. Not only was bipartisan support for Roosevelt's agenda largely dissipated by the struggle, the <b>overall</b> <b>loss</b> of political capital in the arena of public opinion was also significant.|$|E

25|$|The TVR Vixen Series 1 was {{unveiled}} at the British motor show in October 1967. It proved popular, and generated many new orders for cars. With {{the launch of}} the Vixen, TVR transitioned back to making their own fiberglass bodies, rather than depending on Grantura Plastics to build them. Despite the sales success of the Vixen, the company still recorded an <b>overall</b> <b>loss</b> for 1967, and financial advisors began to recommend to Arthur Lilley that the company be shut down.

25|$|The Age of Innocence (1993) was a {{significant}} departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel about the constrictive high society of late-19th century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon original release, but was a box office bomb, making an <b>overall</b> <b>loss.</b> As noted in Scorsese on Scorsese by editor–interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese {{wanted to make a}} film about a failed 19th-century romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity; all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{diversity}} is modest, {{as a result}} of factors including the island's small land area, the relatively recent age of the habitats developed since the last glacial period and the island's physical separation from continental Europe, and the effects of seasonal variability. Great Britain also experienced early industrialisation and is subject to continuing urbanisation, which have contributed towards the <b>overall</b> <b>loss</b> of species. A DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) study from 2006 suggested that 100 species have become extinct in the UK during the 20th century, about 100 times the background extinction rate. However, some species, such as the brown rat, red fox, and introduced grey squirrel, are well adapted to urban areas.|$|E
25|$|Whatever the figures, {{towards the}} end of the 1960s it became {{increasingly}} clear that rail closures were not bringing the rail system out of deficit and were unlikely ever to do so. Transport minister Barbara Castle decided that some rail services, which could not pay their way but had a valuable social role, should be subsidised. Legislation allowing this was introduced in the 1968 Transport Act (Section 39 made provision for a subsidy to be paid by the Treasury for a three-year period) but this was later repealed in the Railways Act 1974. Whether these subsidies affected the size of the network is questionable: the criteria for reprieving loss-making lines had not altered, merely the way their costs appeared in the railways accounts—previously their contribution to the railways' <b>overall</b> <b>loss</b> was hidden in the total deficit.|$|E

25|$|Biofilms {{have become}} {{problematic}} in several food industries {{due to the}} ability to form on plants and during industrial processes. Bacteria can survive long periods of time in water, animal manure, and soil, causing biofilm formation on plants or in the processing equipment. The buildup of biofilms can affect the heat flow across a surface and increase surface corrosion and frictional resistance of fluids. These can lead to a loss of energy in a system and <b>overall</b> <b>loss</b> of products. Along with economic problems biofilm formation on food poses a health risk to consumers due {{to the ability to}} make the food more resistant to disinfectants As a result, from 1996 to 2010 the Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 48 million foodborne illnesses per year. Biofilms have been connected to about 80% of bacterial infections in the United States.|$|E
25|$|However, during {{onset of}} osteoarthritis, the {{collagen}} matrix becomes more disorganized {{and there is}} a decrease in proteoglycan content within cartilage. The breakdown of collagen fibers results in a net increase in water content. This increase occurs because whilst there is an <b>overall</b> <b>loss</b> of proteoglycans (and thus a decreased osmotic pull), it is outweighed by a loss of collagen. Without the protective effects of the proteoglycans, the collagen fibers of the cartilage can become susceptible to degradation and thus exacerbate the degeneration. Inflammation of the synovium (joint cavity lining) and the surrounding joint capsule can also occur, though often mild (compared to the synovial inflammation that occurs in rheumatoid arthritis). This can happen as breakdown products from the cartilage are released into the synovial space, and the cells lining the joint attempt to remove them.|$|E

500|$|Aurora was Disney's last princess created before Walt Disney's {{death in}} 1966. When Sleeping Beauty was first {{released}} in 1959, the film performed poorly {{at the box}} office while failing to impress critics. According to TheRichest, Aurora was partially responsible for Disney’s only <b>overall</b> <b>loss</b> that decade, thus the studio decided to avoid adapting fairy tales into feature-length animated films for several years; Aurora would remain Disney's last princess until The Little Mermaids Ariel debuted in 1989, 30 years later. Mic's Melissa Hugel believes that the negative reception spawned by Aurora's passive role as a woman in Sleeping Beauty also contributed to this hiatus, earning the character {{a reputation as one of}} Disney's worst princesses. Meanwhile, David Nusair of About.com attributes the film's failure with [...] "the familiarity of its storyline, as the film boasts many of the elements contained within both of its predecessors – including the revelation that Princess Aurora can only be awoken from her deep slumber by a kiss from her one true love" [...] similar to Snow White. Hollywood.com ranked Sleeping Beauty Disney's worst princess film because its main character remains asleep for the majority of it. However, Aurora has since established herself as a popular character nonetheless due to her singing voice and beauty. At one point, the name [...] "Aurora" [...] became a popular baby name, with parents often naming their daughters after the character. However, despite being featured prominently in Disney merchandise, [...] "Aurora has become an oft-forgotten princess", and her popularity pales in comparison to those of Cinderella and Snow White. While creating the Disney Princess franchise, Disney Consumer Products decided that Aurora should be marketed wearing the pink version of her dress in order to further distinguish her from Cinderella, who also wears blue. BuzzFeed readers voted Aurora their sixth favorite Disney Princess, who garnered 7% of the 9,554 votes.
