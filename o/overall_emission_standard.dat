When firms compete with each other in a Cournot fashion, as the home <b>emission</b> <b>standard</b> becomes stricter, aggregate emissions of both domestic and foreign countries decrease, if a firm which produces a gdirtier producthf supplies the same product to both domestic and foreign markets. On the other hand, if the firm supplies different products in environmental features to different markets, a stricter <b>emission</b> <b>standard</b> by the home government increases aggregate emissions of the foreign country.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{available}} evidence on {{the relevance of the}} Porter hypothesis for automotive <b>emission</b> <b>standards.</b> It focuses on two channels through which the Porter effect may operate. First, there is evidence that <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> for cars have had important effects on innovation at different levels in the supply chain (the “weak” form of the Porter hypothesis), without discernible long-run negative effects in industry performance. However, there is no strong evidence either that regulations lead to an overall increase in productivity (the “strong” version of the Porter hypothesis). Second, there is relatively strong evidence that countries {{are more likely to have}} more stringent domestic vehicular <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> if they export more automobiles and automobile components to countries which themselves have more stringent vehicular standards. There is also (mixed) evidence that countries which receive more inward foreign direct investment in the automotive sector are more likely to have more stringent domestic <b>emission</b> <b>standards.</b> This suggests that imposing strict <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> may bring some “first mover advantages” to the leading countries, in line with the Porter hypothesis. ...|$|R

40|$|Based on a {{model of}} {{industrial}} dynamics, this paper examines the impact of polluting <b>emissions</b> <b>standards</b> on trajectories of clean technologies implemented by firms subject to competitive selection and supply chain pressure. The model incorporates a few stylised facts on the relationships between environmental regulation, innovation and diffusion. The main objective is to highlight the forces influencing the long term dynamics of an industry faced with evolving <b>emissions</b> <b>standards</b> in a ‘history-friendly’ way. The paper gives guidance to the conditions of dynamic efficiency of <b>emissions</b> <b>standards</b> {{taking into account the}} coevolution of technology, user requirements and market structure. We show that <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> not only {{play a significant role in}} orienting research and innovation activities of supplier firms, but they are also likely to support the diffusion of environmental innovation in the supply chain. In some cases, <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> lead to prevent both a situation of lock-in on the supply side and a situation of behavioural inertia on the user side. Standards may thus lead to preserve a certain form of technological and behavioural diversity. Based on the computer simulations, it will be shown that the efficiency of standards depends on the nature of performance standards (process or product), on the market structure and on the timing of intervention. environmental innovation; industrial dynamics; environmental supply chain pressure; <b>emission</b> <b>standards...</b>|$|R
