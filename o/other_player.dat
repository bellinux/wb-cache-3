Healy ended her first full season as a wicket-keeper with 208 runs at 29.71, the second-highest average in her team behind Blackwell. In 11 matches, she also took 11 catches and completed 9 stumpings, effecting more dismissals than any <b>other</b> <b>player.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mike Cameron hit {{his four}} on May 2, 2002, and Green matched the total 21 days later on May 23, 2002, the {{shortest}} span between such games. Lowe and Seerey each hit fewer than 100 career home runs, while Willie Mays, with 660, hit {{more than any}} <b>other</b> <b>player</b> in this group. Both Mays and Schmidt are also members of the 500 home run club.|$|E
50|$|Single-player games such as Minecraft allow {{players to}} {{optionally}} {{create their own}} world without <b>other</b> <b>players,</b> and then combine skills from the game to work together with <b>other</b> <b>players</b> and create bigger and more intricate environments. These environments can then be accessed by <b>other</b> <b>players,</b> if the server is available to <b>other</b> <b>players</b> then {{they may be able}} to modify parts of it, such as the structure of the environment.|$|R

5|$|On August 6, 1890, Young's {{major league}} debut, he pitched a three-hit 8 - 1 {{victory over the}} Chicago Colts. While Young was on the Spiders, Chief Zimmer was his catcher more often than any <b>other</b> <b>player.</b> Bill James, a {{baseball}} statistician, estimated that Zimmer caught Young in more games than any other battery in baseball history.|$|E
5|$|One such {{solution}} is by bidding: Players take turns bidding {{on how many}} moves it will take them to win the game. The lowest bidder gets the king. Thus, one player may open with a bid of 15turns, the <b>other</b> <b>player</b> may counter with a bid of 14turns, and the first player, more confident {{in his ability to}} escape in 13rounds than in his ability to contain for 14, may bid 13 and take the king's side. If that player does not escape within 13turns, the <b>other</b> <b>player</b> wins. Another workaround is to play a two-round match, in which players switch sides after the first round. If the king escapes both rounds, the winner is the player whose king escaped in the fewest turns.|$|E
5|$|The NHL First and Second Team All-Stars {{consists}} of the top players at each position as voted on by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association. Gordie Howe has been selected twenty-one times, more than any <b>other</b> <b>player</b> in league history.|$|E
50|$|The game {{revolved}} around fighting and robbing <b>other</b> <b>players,</b> doing Jobs, Missions, and Operations to earn cash, building parts, weapons, attack and defense fighting skills, and experience, {{with the goal}} of establishing and advancing one's criminal empire. Players created mafias by recruiting <b>other</b> <b>players</b> or winning or buying artificial members (Hired Guns). <b>Other</b> <b>players</b> could be added to one's mafia through Facebook.|$|R
50|$|All players first {{review and}} {{appraise}} their own cards without showing their cards to the <b>other</b> <b>players.</b> Then, players take turns {{to bid for}} the landlord position by telling the <b>other</b> <b>players</b> the risk stake {{they are willing to}} accept.|$|R

5000|$|Indirect {{reciprocity}} {{is based}} on knowing the <b>other</b> <b>player's</b> reputation, which is the <b>player's</b> history with <b>other</b> <b>players.</b> Cooperation depends on a reliable history being projected from past partners to future partners.|$|R
5000|$|... small misery: {{a player}} thinks he can't get any tricks. He {{is allowed to}} discard one card (as are the <b>other</b> <b>players).</b> The <b>other</b> <b>players</b> must try {{to force him to}} get a trick.|$|R

5|$|This was {{the highest}} scoring period in NHL history. It was led in the 1980s by the Edmonton Oilers and Wayne Gretzky, who scored 200 points or more four times, {{including}} a current league-record 215 in 1985–86. Gretzky's 92 goals in 1981–82 also remains a league record. No <b>other</b> <b>player</b> in NHL history has scored 200 points, although Mario Lemieux came close in 1988–89 with 199.|$|E

Bradman scored centuries at a rate better than one every three innings—in 80Test innings, Bradman scored 29centuries.

50|$|On the Spot - One {{player is}} chosen {{to answer a}} question. Then, after being shown a vague subject for the question, the <b>other</b> <b>players</b> vote on whether they think the main player will get the answer right. The answerer then scores more points if they answer against how the <b>other</b> <b>players</b> thought they would. The <b>other</b> <b>players</b> then win the points if they are right, and lose the points if they are wrong.|$|R
50|$|Players {{are allowed}} to attack and kill <b>other</b> <b>players</b> ingame for any given reason, though it is {{generally}} frowned upon. Once a player has killed another player they are labeled with either yellow or later, red, that informs <b>other</b> <b>players</b> that they have killed somebody recently. Red players are not allowed in most cities and are generally ignored by NPC's. Red players are also fair game to <b>other</b> <b>players,</b> a punishment for their PK status.|$|R

5|$|Dr. Mario {{offers a}} {{multiplayer}} gaming mode {{in which two}} players compete {{against each other in}} separate playing fields. In this mode, the player's goal is to clear their own playing field of viruses before the <b>other</b> <b>player</b> does. Eliminating multiple viruses or initiating chain reactions can cause additional capsules to fall onto the opponent's playing field. A player wins a single game upon eliminating all the viruses or if the other playing field fills up. The first player to win three games wins overall.|$|E

5|$|Fischer won the 1962 Stockholm Interzonal by a 2½-point margin, going undefeated, with 17½/22 (+13−0=9). He was {{the first}} non-Soviet player to win an Interzonal since FIDE instituted the tournament in 1948. Russian {{grandmaster}} Alexander Kotov said of Fischer:I have discussed Fischer's play with Max Euwe and Gideon Stahlberg. All of us, experienced 'tournament old-timers', were surprised by Fischer's endgame expertise. When a young player is good at attacking or at combinations, this is understandable, but a faultless endgame technique {{at the age of}} 19 is something rare. I can recall only one <b>other</b> <b>player</b> who at that age was equally skillful at endgames — Vasily Smyslov.|$|E
5|$|In 17 {{first-class}} fixtures, 85 different cricketers appeared for I Zingari. Lancashire and England Test cricketer A. G.

Webbe scored the most runs for I Zingari, accumulating 612 during his seven matches. He also scored more centuries for the amateur side than any <b>other</b> <b>player,</b> passing 100 on two occasions, while the highest score for I Zingari was 147, by Teddy Wynyard. Alfred Lyttelton, one of three Lyttelton brothers {{to play for the}} side, was the most successful wicket-keeper, claiming 17 dismissals.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Berry {{recorded}} his only 1,000-yard season, as he caught 74 passes and had career highs in receiving yards (1,298) and receiving {{yards per game}} (108.2).

He had a mid-season string of six straight games with over 100 yards, during which he caught 50 passes for 920 yards and eight touchdowns. Berry again was a Pro Bowl invitee, and earned first-team All-Pro honors from all the same selectors as the previous year, including unanimous All-Pro recognition by UPI sportswriters.|$|E
