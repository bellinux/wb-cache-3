5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> an album <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E

5|$|I've {{never had}} chills through my entire body like I had from hearing Beyoncé sing this song. 'I Was Here' came from my soul {{and became the}} song that was coming from hers.

5|$|O you, Son, who, {{concealed}} in your mother's womb, you gather together peoples by your Father's act – for I perchance {{am able to}} compose a holy narrative because you are seen to be God, because, glorious one, the glittering stars show (you) to the world; and I ask, after the close <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> that you grant {{to me from the}} throne of heaven to take a tiny gift because of the honour (I have) attained.|$|E

5|$|With this tour, I'm {{going to}} be working on some {{different}} arrangements for some of the older songs, to... give it a little more life to them. That's not to say they're going to sound totally different and to freak anybody out... I love re-singing songs to different music. I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs mean so much to me, this time <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> has been so wonderful for me, and I want to experience that with my fans.|$|E

5|$|Bon Voyage debuted {{at number}} one on both the Japanese Daily and Weekly Oricon Albums Chart, with over 46,000 units sold in its first week. It became Koda's sixth studio album {{to reach the top}} spot, but became her lowest first week sales since her debut album Affection (2002). It fell to 21 in its second week, {{shifting}} over 5,000 units. The album stayed in the top 100 for four weeks, and the overall top 300 for twelve weeks. As of January 2016, Bon Voyage has sold an estimated 59,499 units, making it her first album to not sell over the 100,000 limit. Because of this, it failed to achieve a certification by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). It was her lowest selling studio album at the time, until her next album Walk <b>Of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> sold less by May 2015 (with 50,000 units). Bon Voyage reached number five on Japan's Billboard Top Albums Sales.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Brooklyn Preparatory, a Jesuit school, on {{a scholarship}} and graduated as class valedictorian in 1946. He later attended Georgetown University on a scholarship, where {{he earned his}} bachelor's degree in English in 1950. Those years at Georgetown were probably the best years <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> Blatty said in 2015. Until then, I’d never had a home. While studying for his master's degree at George Washington University, Blatty took menial jobs. Initially {{unable to find a}} job in teaching, he worked as a vacuum cleaner door-to-door salesman, a beer truck driver, and as a United Airlines ticket agent. He earned his master's in English literature from the George Washington University in 1954. He then enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he ultimately became head of the Policy Branch of the USAF Psychological Warfare Division.|$|E
5|$|Much of our {{information}} about the first Marshalsea is about the prison in the early 18th-century, courtesy of three sources. John Baptist Grano (1692 – c. 1748), one of George Frederick Handel's trumpeters at the opera house in London's Haymarket, was jailed there for a debt of £99 (£ today), and kept a detailed diary, A Journal <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> inside the Marshalsea, of his 458-day incarceration from 30 May 1728 until 23 September 1729. The other two key sources are a 1729 report by a parliamentary committee, led by James Oglethorpe MP, {{on the state of}} the Fleet and the Marshalsea, and the subsequent murder trial that year of William Acton, the Marshalsea's chief jailor.|$|E
