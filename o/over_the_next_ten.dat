A ninth armored cruiser, , was a much larger vessel representing an intermediate step between armored cruisers and battlecruisers.

Kentuckian had a leak in her number two cargo hold and damage to her port bilge keel and returned to San Francisco for repairs.

50|$|One {{theory for}} the {{formation}} of the basin is that it is dynamic topography due to a sinking slab of oceanic crust. This slab was subducted during latest Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic periods {{to the north of the}} Australian continent underneath New Guinea. The slab broke off and was gradually overridden by the Australian plate moving north. The sinking slab has a trace in the P-wave velocity in the mantle which is higher from 800 to 1200 km deep below the Murray basin, and also the Lake Eyre Basin. The velocity anomaly is oriented northwest-southeast and extends from 135°E 26°S to 144°E35°S. The sinking has dragged down the rock above it to make a hollow which is the basin. This hollow has moved south <b>over</b> <b>the</b> last 50 million years. If this theory is correct, then the Murray basin will move south <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>tens</b> of millions of years and disappear under the Southern Ocean. Modelling using the Underworld program by Moresi indicates that the slab would be sinking at 8.5 mm per year and cause a depression on the surface 200 m deep around 2500 km wide. In the past the basin depression was narrower but deeper in this model.|$|R

By 1804, very few natives lived on the barrier islands, where the Karankawa had made their home. In January 1790, the Comanche also helped the Spanish fight a large battle against the Mescalero and Lipan Apaches at Soledad Creek west of San Antonio. Over 1000Comanche warriors participated in raids against the Apache in 1791 and 1792, and the Apache were forced to scatter into the mountains in Mexico.

5|$|In 1960 Sihanouk built a {{personal}} residence at Chamkarmon District {{where he lived}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>ten</b> years as the Head of State.

In 1971 Sihanouk moved to a larger residence in the city that once housed the French embassy. The residence was equipped with a temperature-adjustable swimming pool, cinema and seven chefs to cook his meals. In 1974 North Korean leader Kim Il-sung built Changsuwon, a 40-room mansion, for Sihanouk. Changsuwon was built near an artificial lake, and Sihanouk spent time taking boat trips there and also shot a few films within the compound. In August 2008 Sihanouk declared his assets on his website, which according to him consisted of a small house in Siem Reap and 30,000 Euros of cash savings stored in a French bank.
