5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> remains unknown, {{but it is}} {{believed}} that its origin may be southwest of its actual location, possibly at Bukit Timah. Hot springs are formed when underground water comes into contact with hot rock masses. The resulting high pressure causes the water to seep upwards through cracks, forcing itself out of the ground as a spring.|$|E
5|$|As in the {{previous}} winter, Simpson went on a skiing holiday. On 25 January he fell, breaking his right tibia, and his leg was in a plaster cast {{until the end of}} February.

Simpson began riding again in March, and in late April started, but did not finish, Liège–Bastogne–Liège.|$|E

5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All {{reduced their}} seasonal predictions in early August, {{but even the}} revised predictions were too high. The lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening of the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> weather pattern over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, and atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.|$|E

5|$|At {{the core}} of Confucian ethics were the {{selected}} virtues of filial piety, harmonious relationships, ritual, and righteousness.

Although full authenticity of Dong's authorship of the Luxuriant Dew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spring</b> and Autumn Annals comes into question with hints that parts were rewritten around the time of Liu Xiang (798 BCE) or Liu Xin (d. 23 CE), three of his original memorials sent to the throne discussing his syncretic version of Confucianism were preserved in the 1st-century-CE Book of Han.|$|E

5|$|Colonel Grierson, {{commander}} of the 10th Cavalry, traversed the hot Chihuahuan Desert and then the narrow valleys of the Chinati Mountains, reaching Rattlesnake Springs {{on the morning of}} August 6, 1880. His cavalrymen and their mounts were worn down from the forced march of over 65miles in 21 hours. After resting and getting water, Grierson carefully placed his men in ambush positions. Carpenter, with his two cavalry troops, arrived as reinforcements and were posted in reserve a short distance south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring.</b> The cavalrymen settled down to wait as Indian scouts brushed away any sign of their presence.|$|E
5|$|Francis Hillier Taylor, {{previously}} senior history {{master at}} The Skinners' School, was appointed as Morgan's successor {{at the end}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> term in 1946, a position that attracted 321 applications. During his tenure, Taylor significantly expanded the school facilities: in 1948, the headmaster's living quarters were converted to include a secretaries office, waiting room and medical inspection room (the headmaster moved to neighbouring Brook House, which was purchased by The Skinners' Company). In 1955, new geography rooms were constructed, followed three years later by a new gymnasium. Although not first used until two years later, a swimming pool was constructed in 1964 {{at the cost of}} £9,000. Taylor also introduced some major curriculum changes, including the introduction of new subjects such as rural biology and zoology.|$|E

The French army in Egypt had been trapped there shortly {{after the start of}} the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt in 1798, when the French Mediterranean Fleet was destroyed at the Battle of the Nile. Since that defeat, the French Navy had maintained only a minimal presence in the Mediterranean Sea, while the more numerous British and their allies had succeeded in blockading and defeating several French bases almost unopposed.|$|E
