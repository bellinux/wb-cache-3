In the mid-1970s Spurr returned to the Far East again, this time as {{a writer for the}} Far Eastern Economic Review. He began conducting interviews about Yamato with former Japanese naval commanders and survivors of the battleship's last mission. He also gained access to Japanese naval documents and records seized by the United States, plus US interrogation transcripts. For the American side of the story, he interviewed US naval commanders and personnel involved in the sinking of Yamato. Satisfied with what he had, Spurr began writing the book in the late 1970s, over 30 years after he first found out about the battleship.|$|E

5|$|Attorney Hy Mayerson was {{an early}} pioneer in Agent Orange litigation, working with {{environmental}} attorney Victor Yannacone in 1980 on the first class-action suits against wartime manufacturers of Agent Orange. In meeting Dr. Ronald A.

5|$|Because the South Korean {{forces had}} {{suffered}} nearly 45,000 casualties {{at the end}} of 1950, most of the South Korean units were composed of raw recruits with little combat training. After inspecting the front just days before the battle, General J. Lawton Collins, the US Army Chief of Staff, concluded that most of the ROK formations were only fit for outpost duties. At the same time, the US Eighth Army was also suffering from low morale due to its earlier defeats, and most of its soldiers were anticipating an evacuation from Korea. The Eighth Army's lack of will to fight and to maintain contact with Chinese forces resulted in a lack <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> Chinese troop movements and intentions. After inspecting the front on December 27, Ridgway ordered the US I and IX Corps to organize a new defensive line around Koyang to Uijeongbu, called the Seoul Bridgehead line, to cover the Han River crossings in case the UN forces were forced to evacuate Seoul.|$|E

5|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition in foreign exchange markets which {{depends on the}} availability of the forward market. It can be rearranged to give the forward exchange rate {{as a function of the}} other variables. The forward exchange rate depends on three known variables: the spot exchange rate, the domestic {{interest rate}}, and the foreign interest rate. This effectively means that the forward rate is the price of a forward contract, which derives its value from the pricing of spot contracts and the addition <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> available interest rates.|$|E
5|$|Etruscan {{architecture}} {{was created}} between about 700 BC and 200 BC, when the expanding civilization of ancient Rome finally absorbed Etruscan civilization.

5|$|Financed, {{trained and}} {{equipped}} by the Germans, the saboteurs sank the armed trawler , and destroyed the auxiliary minesweeper , {{which resulted in}} the deaths of six British seamen on 18 January 1942. Plazas was assisted by the Spanish naval commander of Puente Mayorga, Manuel Romero Hume, who allowed him to beach a rowboat there. The British intelligence was able however to counteract the sabotage operations. In March 1942, a Gibraltarian, José Key, {{one of the most prominent}} agents working for the Germans, responsible for the collection <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> military movements for the Abwehr was arrested and executed in Wandsworth Prison in late 1942. By September 1942, Plazas, whose activities were closely monitored by the British at that time, resigned and left Carlos Calvo, his second in command, in charge of the operations. In late 1942, the German headquarters in Berlin ordered the sabotage operations being expanded. In early 1943, the arrival of an experienced head of Abwehr operations in Spain improved the outreach of the operations.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} subject matter, {{the story of}} Joan of Arc was not well known outside of a legend. A history dealing with Joan written by Clement L'Averdy was written in 1790 but it was {{probably}} unknown to Southey. This would serve as the major historical source <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> her until Jules Quicherat's history published during the mid-19th century. Of non-historical works, Voltaire's La Pucelle was well known but the work attacks Joan. Joan's reputation was polemical, and Joan would later {{be turned into a}} French hero with Napoleon's encouragement. Friedrich Schiller would also deal with the legend the same way in Die Jungfrau von Orleans. In terms of works relying on the general idea of a warrior woman, many such figures exited in epics: Virgil and Camilla, Tasso has Clorinda, and Spenser had Britomart. However, such females were not the central figure as a woman was unique to Southey at the time.|$|E
5|$|Many {{substances}} {{enter the}} sea {{as a result}} of human activities. Combustion products are transported in the air and deposited through precipitation. Agricultural, industrial, and sewage outflows contribute heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, disinfectants, cleaning products, and other synthetic chemicals. These become concentrated in the surface film and in marine sediment, especially estuarine mud. The result of all this contamination is largely unknown because of the large number of substances involved and the lack <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> their biological effects. The heavy metals of greatest concern are copper, lead, mercury, cadmium, and zinc which may be accumulated by marine invertebrates. They are then passed up the food chain.|$|E
