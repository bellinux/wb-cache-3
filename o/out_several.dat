5|$|After the {{revisions}} were completed, much of {{the plot}} stayed the same, but several events in the original draft were cut out to strengthen the whole book. Stead combined two characters into one, having a stronger outline and also cut <b>out</b> <b>several</b> scenes for minor characters. In the end, Stead found that the revisions helped to make the book more cohesive.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} blockade, the Egyptian Navy carried <b>out</b> <b>several</b> other missions. Coastal {{artillery}} at Port Said {{participated in the}} fire preparation by bombarding Fort Budapest and Fort Orkal, while coastal artillery at Suez hit targets opposite the Third Army. Missile boats bombarded Rumana and Ras Beyron on the Mediterranean, Ras Masala and Ras Sidr on the Gulf of Suez, and Sharm el Sheikh. Naval frogmen raided the oil installations at Bala'eem, disabling the massive driller.|$|E
5|$|FBO's many shorts—the popular George O'Hara and Alberta Vaughn series, {{and scores}} of others—are largely forgotten. Of {{particular}} historical interest are two independently produced series of slapstick comedies with important performers: FBO put <b>out</b> <b>several</b> shorts in 1924–25 made by Joe Rock and starring Stan Laurel, before his famous partnership with Oliver Hardy. In 1926–27, the company distributed {{more than a dozen}} shorts by innovative comedian/animator Charles Bowers.|$|E

5|$|In {{southern}} Florida, {{damage was}} mostly limited to moderate wind gusts; in Miami-Dade County, gusty winds knocked <b>out</b> <b>several</b> traffic lights along U.S. 1, the only route {{to and from}} the Florida Keys. A man died in Ft. Lauderdale when he stepped on a downed electrical wire and was electrocuted. Also, 100,000homes in Miami Dade County were without electric power.|$|E
5|$|Late Roman {{emperors}} continued {{major and}} frequent offensive operations beyond the imperial borders throughout the 4th century. These were strikingly {{similar to the}} pincer movements described by Luttwak as being characteristic of forward defence in the early Principate. For example, Valentinian I's campaign against the Quadi in 375. Julian in 356–60 and Valentinian I in 368–74 carried <b>out</b> <b>several</b> operations across the Rhine and Danube designed to force the submission of local tribes and their acceptance of tributarii status.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues amongst islanders {{in the 21st century}} is {{what to do about the}} rodent situation. Rodents have only been on the island since a ship ran aground in 1918 and have wiped <b>out</b> <b>several</b> endemic bird species and were thought to have done the same to the Lord Howe Island stick insect. There is a plan to drop 42 tonnes of rat bait across the island but the community is heavily divided.|$|E

5|$|The {{precursor}} system dropped {{heavy rainfall}} on 23 March {{in the eastern}} Kimberley {{in the state of}} Western Australia. The rainfall led to record flooding in the area; the flooding washed <b>out</b> <b>several</b> roads near Kununurra, including a portion of the Great Northern Highway. Six people were evacuated due to the flooding.|$|E

5|$|A {{small number}} of Ju 87s were also {{retained}} for anti-shipping operations in the Black Sea, a role it had proved so successful in when operating in the Mediterranean. In October 1943, this became evident again when StG 3 carried <b>out</b> <b>several</b> attacks against the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. On 6 October 1943 the most powerful flotilla in the fleet comprising the Leningrad class destroyers Kharkov, Besposhchadny and Sposobny were caught and sunk by dive -bombing. After the disaster, Josef Stalin decreed that no more ships were to pass within range of German aircraft without his personal permission.|$|E
5|$|After {{suffering}} a foot injury {{during the first}} home match of the 2014 season on April 14, Rapinoe sat <b>out</b> <b>several</b> games and made her second season appearance on July 3 against Western New York Flash. Her four goals and one assist {{during the regular season}} helped the Reign secure the league's regular season title (NWSL Shield) with a 16–2–6 record and 54 points – 13 points ahead of the second place team, FC Kansas City. During the team's playoff semi-final match against Washington Spirit, Rapinoe scored a goal helping the Reign win 2–1 and advance to the championship final against FC Kansas City. Despite Rapinoe's goal during the championship final, the Reign was ultimately defeated by Kansas City 2–1.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the Church of the Holy Mother of God was the {{terminus}} of two rival religious processions organised by the ethnic Greek and Bulgarian communities of Asenovgrad. A Greek procession took place in 1899 and a comparable Bulgarian one was carried <b>out</b> <b>several</b> years later. These processions began after a man claimed to have seen lights and heard chants while passing near the then-abandoned church. Both processions ended with a Divine Liturgy observed at night by the church.|$|E

5|$|Because Howard {{remained}} {{away from}} land no tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued. One ship, the Strong Virginian, reported sustained winds 42mph (68km/h) at 0600UTC on September4. Along the Baja California Peninsula, 1618ft (4.85.4m) swells were reported. All ships {{were required to}} remain at port due to the rough seas. Heavy rains in the mountainous and Pacific coastal areas of Baja California produced flooding which washed <b>out</b> <b>several</b> roads in San José del Cabo. The rains did help increase water levels in some reservoirs in Baja California. An estimated 2,000 hectares of agricultural land was damaged by the storm and 48 households were damaged throughout four communities. State and federal authorities purchased temporary homes for those who needed shelter in the affected areas. The State Civil Protection in Mexico provided rehabilitation {{for a total of}} 393 homes affected by Howard.|$|E
5|$|Carolyn Dinshaw {{argues that}} the poem {{may have been a}} {{response}} to accusations that Richard II had a male lover—an attempt to reestablish the idea that heterosexuality was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males. Many religious figures were trying to make the distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality. Still, the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire. In his other poem Cleanness, he points <b>out</b> <b>several</b> grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail. His obsession seems to carry into Gawain in his descriptions of the Green Knight.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as leader of La Familia Michoacana, Moreno González {{reportedly}} gave loans to farmers, funded schools and churches, financed drainage projects, and carried <b>out</b> <b>several</b> aid campaigns to help out the disadvantaged {{in the state of}} Michoacán. This, along with the manpower of the organization, allowed him get the support of several rural sectors in the state, where many served as informants and collaborators for the cartel. His wife was also known for organizing several self-help seminars in Apatzingán. The support of La Familia Michoacana is rooted in family connections and local communities in Michoacán, and in the supposed exploitation of its citizens by the government.|$|E
