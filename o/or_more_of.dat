5|$|Under the {{provisions}} of the Constitution and by law, all adults aged over 18 are eligible to vote, with a secret ballot and a universal suffrage, and those elected have certain protections from apprehension while the Diet is in session. Speeches, debates, and votes cast in the Diet also enjoy parliamentary privileges. Each house is responsible for disciplining its own members, and all deliberations are public unless two-thirds <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> those members present passes a resolution agreeing it otherwise. The Diet also requires the presence of at least one-third of the membership of either house in order to constitute a quorum.

When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term.

5|$|A {{multiple}} sequence alignment (MSA) is {{a sequence}} alignment {{of three or}} more biological sequences, generally protein, DNA, or RNA. In many cases, the input set of query sequences are assumed to have an evolutionary relationship by which they share a lineage and are descended from a common ancestor. From the resulting MSA, sequence homology can be inferred and phylogenetic analysis can be conducted to assess the sequences' shared evolutionary origins. Visual depictions of the alignment as in the image at right illustrate mutation events such as point mutations (single amino acid or nucleotide changes) that appear as differing characters in a single alignment column, and insertion or deletion mutations (indels or gaps) that appear as hyphens in one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the sequences in the alignment. Multiple sequence alignment {{is often used to}} assess sequence conservation of protein domains, tertiary and secondary structures, and even individual amino acids or nucleotides.|$|E

5|$|Animals produce colour in {{different}} ways. Pigments are particles of coloured material. Chromatophores are cells containing pigment, which can change their size {{to make their}} colour more or less visible. Some animals, including many butterflies and birds, have microscopic structures in scales, bristles or feathers which give them brilliant iridescent colours. Other animals including squid and some deep-sea fish can produce light, sometimes of different colours. Animals often use two <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> these mechanisms together to produce the colours and effects they need.|$|E
