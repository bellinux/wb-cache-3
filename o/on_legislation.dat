5|$|One {{major issue}} is the West Lothian question, in which MPs from Scotland and Wales are able to vote <b>on</b> <b>legislation</b> {{affecting}} only England, while English MPs have no equivalent right to legislate on devolved matters. This when placed {{in the context of}} England being the only country of the United Kingdom not to have free cancer treatment, prescriptions, residential care for the elderly and free top-up university fees, has led to a steady rise in English nationalism. Some have suggested the creation of a devolved English parliament, while others have proposed simply limiting voting <b>on</b> <b>legislation</b> which only affects England to English MPs.|$|E

However, as with the delegates from other U.S. territories, the CNMI delegate received limited powers, not being permitted to vote <b>on</b> full <b>legislation</b> <b>on</b> the United States House floor. The new delegate received all of the same allowances, benefits and compensation, including an approximately $170,000 a year salary, as a full member of the House of Representatives.|$|R

5|$|During the American Civil War, Wilson was Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs and the Militia, {{and later}} the Committee on Military Affairs.

5|$|The League of American Bicyclists has rated Colorado as {{the sixth}} most bicycle-friendly {{state in the}} nation for the year 2014.

5|$|The Lords {{continued}} to suggest amendments to money bills over {{which it had}} no right of veto and in several instances, these were accepted by the Commons. These included the China Indemnity Bill 1925 and the Inshore Fishing Industry Bill 1947. The use of the Lords' now temporary veto remains a powerful check <b>on</b> <b>legislation.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{a meeting}} of {{regional}} LNA branches in May, one speech focused <b>on</b> <b>legislation</b> in Europe; the meeting resolved to correspond with sister organisations on the continent. At the start of December 1874 Josephine left for Paris and a tour that covered France, Italy and Switzerland, where she met with local pressure groups and civic authorities. She encountered strong support from feminist groups, but hostility from the authorities. She returned from her travels {{at the end of}} February 1875.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the Prime Minister's {{own party}} was {{breaking}} down underneath him. There {{had been no}} official party platform yet agreed to, and individual members had a wide degree of latitude to determine the issues they ran on, leading to frequent government defections <b>on</b> <b>legislation.</b> The government's existing nine-seat majority shrank during 1928 and 1929 over various issues, {{as a result of}} by-elections, and several leading figures who had previously worked with Bruce became increasingly sharp critics of him. Hughes and Edward Mann were two of the government's most ardent opponents in 1929.|$|E
5|$|In his {{biennial}} {{message to}} the legislature in 1910, Willson called for a uniform system of accounting based <b>on</b> <b>legislation</b> recently passed in the neighboring state of Indiana. He also advocated a measure requiring full disclosure of campaign expenditures. Due to its hostility toward Willson, the Assembly scarcely considered the governor's agenda or other needed legislation such as tax reform and redistricting. The reforms Willson advocated would later pass under a Democratic administration. The few accomplishments of this legislature included making electrocution the legal form of capital punishment and establishing of an eight-hour work day for public workers.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Pollack’s career {{led into}} politics. A summer {{internship}} with the American Jewish Congress prompted a one-year role with the AJC. He {{worked as a}} lobbyist <b>on</b> <b>legislation</b> that would permit religious headwear for active military personal in noncombat settings. Pollack then relocated to Los Angeles to work for Winner & Associates, a leading political public relations firm. He was assigned to consult the Major Baseball League during the labor strife in the early-1990s. The inception of Pollack’s career in sports business occurred in 1992 when he realized—while flying from LA to New York—that there was a niche {{to fill in the}} industry.|$|E
5|$|The Kraków City Council has 43 elected members, {{one of whom}} is the mayor, or President of Kraków, elected {{every four}} years. The {{election}} of the City Council and of the local head of government, which takes place at the same time, is based <b>on</b> <b>legislation</b> introduced on 20 June 2002. The current President of Kraków, re-elected for his fourth term in 2014, is Jacek Majchrowski. Several members of the Polish national Parliament (Sejm) are elected from the Kraków constituency. The city's official symbols include a coat of arms, a flag, a seal, and a banner.|$|E
5|$|The king is {{the head}} of state and {{commander-in-chief}} of the army. He can declare war and peace, ratify laws and treaties, convene and close legislative sessions, call and postpone elections, dismiss the government and dissolve the parliament. The appointed government can also be dismissed through a majority vote of no confidence by the elected House of Representatives. After a bill is proposed by the government, it must be approved by the House of Representatives then the Senate, and becomes law after being ratified by the king. A royal veto <b>on</b> <b>legislation</b> can be overridden by a two-thirds vote in both houses. The parliament also has the right of interpellation.|$|E

5|$|The {{lieutenant}} governor has two constitutional functions. The primary {{function is to}} serve as the President of the Indiana Senate. In the Senate the {{lieutenant governor}} is permitted to debate <b>on</b> <b>legislation,</b> introduce legislation, and vote on matters to break ties. As presiding officer in the Senate, lieutenant governors also have partial control over what legislation will be considered, and influence on the legislative calendar. Unless a special session is called by the governor, the Senate meets for no more than 91 days in any two years period, leaving the lieutenant governor free from his or her senatorial duties in the remainder of the year.|$|E
5|$|Lord Hailsham {{left his}} {{position}} in 1938 due to his failing health, {{and was replaced by}} Lord Maugham, who was appointed on 15 March. His appointment was done on Schuster's advice and was considered quite a surprise as he had no real political experience; even Maugham himself admitted he had not expected to be offered the job. Schuster and Maugham had a difficult relationship, especially after the start of the Second World War in 1939, due to their differing political opinions. Schuster did not play an active part in policy decisions in this period, partially because of his disagreements with Maugham and partially because Maugham preferred to work <b>on</b> <b>legislation</b> and policy changes himself. Schuster later said that he got on with all of his Lord Chancellors except one—Maugham.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the Senate's {{committees}} varies and {{has been the subject}} of debate. The work of the committees is frequently more consensual and less partisan than activity in the parliamentary chambers, and unanimous committee reports that agree recommendations across party lines are not uncommon. As a result, these recommendations may contribute to subsequent government policy announcements and occasionally to changes in government actions. The work of the regulations and ordinances committee has led to revisions of subordinate legislation in significant respects. Committee scrutiny of bills has contributed to them being amended or withdrawn. The impact of committees <b>on</b> <b>legislation</b> overall has however been described as 'rather limited', particularly as the committees that review bills are controlled by a government majority.|$|E

5|$|Weaver {{entered the}} 46th Congress in March 1879. Although the House was closely divided, neither major party {{included}} the Greenbackers in its caucus, leaving them few committee assignments and little input <b>on</b> <b>legislation.</b> Weaver gave his first speech in April 1879, criticizing {{the use of}} the army to police Southern polling stations, while also decrying the violence against black Southerners that made such protection necessary; he then described the Greenback platform, which he said would {{put an end to the}} sectional and economic strife. The next month, he spoke in favor of a bill calling for an increase in the money supply by allowing the unlimited coinage of silver, but the bill was easily defeated. Weaver's oratorical skill drew praise, and while he was unable to advance Greenback policy ideas, he was soon considered the front-runner for the presidential nomination in 1880.|$|E
5|$|During sessions, {{members may}} speak after being called {{on by the}} President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates. Partly due {{to the need for}} translation, and the {{politics}} of consensus in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the Westminster system. Voting is conducted primarily by a show of hands, that may be checked on request by electronic voting. Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. This is required for the final votes <b>on</b> <b>legislation</b> and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the Official Journal of the European Union and can be accessed online. Votes usually do not follow a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote is unpredictable and if it continues for longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.|$|E
5|$|In Anglo-Saxon England, Witenagemot was {{an early}} {{equivalent}} to the Privy Council of England. During the reigns of the Norman monarchs, the English Crown was advised by a royal court or curia regis, which consisted of magnates, ecclesiastics and high officials. The body originally concerned itself with advising the sovereign <b>on</b> <b>legislation,</b> administration and justice. Later, different bodies assuming distinct functions evolved from the court. The courts of law took over the business of dispensing justice, while Parliament became the supreme legislature of the kingdom. Nevertheless, the Council retained the power to hear legal disputes, either {{in the first instance}} or on appeal. Furthermore, laws made by the sovereign on the advice of the Council, rather than on the advice of Parliament, were accepted as valid. Powerful sovereigns often used the body to circumvent the Courts and Parliament. For example, a committee of the Council—which later became the Court of the Star Chamber—was during the 15th century permitted to inflict any punishment except death, without being bound by normal court procedure. During Henry VIII's reign, the sovereign, on the advice of the Council, was allowed to enact laws by mere proclamation. The legislative pre-eminence of Parliament was not restored until after Henry VIII's death. Though the royal Council retained legislative and judicial responsibilities, it became a primarily administrative body. The Council consisted of forty members in 1553, but the sovereign relied on a smaller committee, which later evolved into the modern Cabinet.|$|E
