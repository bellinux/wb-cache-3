Although Leopold {{did not reveal}} {{the full extent of}} the tour's earnings, or its expenses, the material benefits from the tour had evidently been considerablebut so had the costs. The librarian of St Peter's Abbey, Salzburg, thought that the gifts ("gewgaws") alone which they brought back were worth about 12,000 florins, but estimated the total costs of the enterprise at 20,000 florins. The expenses were certainly high; in a letter to Hagenauer sent in September 1763, after ten weeks on the road, Leopold reported expenses to date as 1,068 florins, an amount covered by their concert earnings without, however, any significant surplus. Leopold stated that [...] "there was nothing to be saved, because we have to travel in noble or courtly style for the preservation <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>health</b> and the reputation of my court". He later recorded that on arrival in Paris in November 1763 that they had [...] "very little money".|$|E
2500|$|The ‘argument from hallucination’ has {{traditionally}} {{been one of those}} used by proponents of the philosophical theory of representationalism against direct realism. [...] Representationalism holds that when perceiving the world we are not in direct contact with it, as common sense suggests, but only in direct contact with a representation of the world in consciousness. [...] That representation may be a more or less accurate one depending on our circumstances, the state <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>health,</b> and so on. [...] Direct realism, on the other hand, holds that the common sense or unthinking view of perception is correct, and that when perceiving the world we should be regarded as in direct contact with it, unmediated by any representation in consciousness.|$|E

6000|$|The years passed, and, one sunny morning, the Snark {{poked her}} nose {{into a narrow}} opening in a reef that smoked with the {{crashing}} impact of the trade-wind swell, and beat slowly up Papeete harbour. Coming off to us was a boat, flying a yellow flag. We knew it contained the port doctor. But quite a distance off, in its wake, was a tiny out rigger canoe that puzzled us. It was flying a red flag. I studied it through the glasses, fearing that it marked some hidden danger to navigation, some recent wreck or some buoy or beacon that had been swept away. Then the doctor came on board. After he had examined the state <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>health</b> and been assured that we had no live rats hidden away in the Snark, I asked him {{the meaning of the}} red flag.

6000|$|Dipping clothes wetted with rain, in Sea-water.--Captain Bligh, who {{was turned}} adrift {{in an open}} boat after the mutiny of the 'Bounty,' writes thus about his experience:--"With respect to the {{preservation}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>health,</b> during a course of 16 days of heavy and almost continual rain, I would recommend to every one {{in a similar situation}} the method we practised, which is to dip their clothes in the salt water and wring them out as often as they become filled with rain: it was the only resource we had, and I believe was of the greatest service to us, for it felt more like a change of dry clothes than could well be imagined. We had occasion to do this so often, that at length our clothes were wrung to pieces; for except the few days we passed on the coast of New Holland, we were continually wet, either with rain or sea." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{our state}} of health varies greatly from time to time, however, so do the {{warnings}} of this last sympathetic adviser change and flicker. Sweet things are always sweet, and bitter things always bitter; vinegar is always sour, and ginger always hot in the mouth, too, whatever our {{state of health}} or feeling. But our taste for roast loin of mutton, high game, salmon cutlets, and Gorgonzola cheese varies immensely from time to time, with the passing condition <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>health</b> and digestion. In illness, and especially in sea-sickness, one gets the distaste carried to the extreme: you may eat grapes or suck an orange in the chops of the Channel, {{but you do not}} feel warmly attached to the steward who offers you a basin of greasy ox-tail, or consoles you with promises of ham sandwiches in half a minute. Under those two painful conditions it is the very light, fresh, and stimulating things that one can most easily swallow--champagne, soda-water, strawberries, peaches; not lobster salad, sardines on toast, green Chartreuse, or hot brandy-and-water. On the other hand, in robust health, and when hungry with exercise, you can eat fat pork with relish on a Scotch hillside, or dine off fresh salmon three days running without inconvenience. Even a Spanish stew, with plenty of garlic in it, and floating in olive oil, tastes positively delicious after a day's mountaineering in the Pyrenees.|$|E

"She says she's goin' to put 'em {{on again}} {{as soon as}} she gets back to Willoughby," [...] the younger woman {{explained}} to Mrs. Sewell in an aside, while the minister was engaged with Lemuel and his mother. [...] "But I tell her as long as it ain't the fashion in Boston, I guess she hadn't better, he-e-e-re." [...] Statira had got on her genteel prolongation of her last syllables again. [...] "I guess I shall get along with her. She's kind of queer when you first get acquainted; but she's real good-heart-e-e-d." [...] She was herself very prettily dressed, and though she looked thin, and at times gave a deep, dismal cough, she was so bright and gay that it was impossible not to feel hopeful about her. She became very confidential with Mrs. Sewell, whom she apparently brevetted Lemuel's best friend, and obliged to a greater show of interest in him than she had ever felt. She told her the whole history of her love affair, and of how much 'Manda Grier had done to help it on at first, and then how she had wanted her to break off with Lemuel. [...] "But," [...] she concluded, [...] "I think we're goin' to get along real nice together. I don't know as we shall live all in the same hou-ou-se; I guess it'll be the best thing for Lem and I if we can board till we get some little <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>health</b> back; I'm more scared for him than what I am for my-se-e-lf. I don't presume but what we shall both miss the city some; but he might be out of a job all winter in town; I shouldn't want he should go back on them ca-a-rs. Most I hate is leavin' 'Manda Grier, she is the one that I've roomed with ever since I first came to Boston; but Lem and her don't get on very well; they hain't really either of 'em got anything against each other now, but they don't like very we-e-ll; and, of course, I got to have the friends that he wants me to have, and that's what 'Manda Grier says, to-o-o; and so it's just as well we're goin' to be where they won't cla-a-sh." ...|$|E

Wherefore of judgment I shall now Inform you what I may, That you may see what 'tis, and how 'Twill be with men that day. 3. This world it hath a time to stand, Which time when ended, then Will issue judgment out of hand Upon all sorts of men. 4. The Judge we find, in God's record, The Son of man, for he By God's appointment is made Lord And Judge of all that be. 5. Wherefore this Son of man shall come At last to count with all, And unto them shall give just doom, Whether they stand or fall. 6. Behold ye now the majesty And state that shall attend This Lord, this Judge, and Justice high When he doth now descend. 7. He comes with head as white as snow, With eyes like flames of fire; In justice clad from top to toe, Most glorious in attire. 8. His face is filled with gravity; His tongue is like a sword; His presence awes both stout and high, The world shakes at his word. 9. He comes in flaming fire, and With angels clear and bright, Each with a trumpet in his hand, Clothed in shining white. 10. The trump of God sounds in the air, The dead do hear his voice; The living too run here and there, Who made not him their choice. 11. Thus to his place he doth repair, Appointed for his throne, Where he will sit to judge, and where He'll count with every one. 12. Angels attending on his hand By thousands on a row; Yea, thousand thousands by him stand, And at his beck do go. 13. Thus being set, the books do ope In which all crimes are writ. All virtues, too, of faith and hope, Of love; and every whit 14. Of all that man hath done or said, Or did intend to do; Whether they sinn'd, or were afraid Evil to come into. 15. Before this bar each sinner now In person must appear; Under his judgment there to bow With trembling and with fear: 16. Within whose breast a witness then Will certainly arise, That to each charge will say Amen, While they seek and devise 17. To shun the sentence which the Lord Against them then will read, Out of the books of God's record, With majesty and dread. 18. But every heart shall opened be Before this judge most high; Yea, every thought to judgment he Will bring assuredly. 19. And every word and action, too, He there will manifest; Yea, all that ever thou didst do, Or keep within thy breast, 20. Shall then be seen and laid before The world, that then will stand To see thy judge open ev'ry sore, And all thy evils scann'd. 21. Weighing each sin and wickedness With so much equity, Proportioning of thy distress And woful misery. 22. With so much justice, doing right, That thou thyself shalt say, My sins have brought me to this plight, I threw myself away. 23. Into that gulph my sins have brought Me justly to possess, For which I blame not Christ, I wrought It out by wickedness. 24. But O! how willingly would these That thus in judgment be, If {{that they might have}} help or ease, Unto the mountains flee. 25. They would rejoice if that they might But underneath them creep, To hide them from revenging right, For fear of which they weep. 26. But all in vain, the mountains then Will all be fled and gone; No shelter will be found for men That now are left alone. 27. For succour they did not regard When Christ by grace did call To them, therefore they are not heard, No mountains on them fall. 28. Before this Judge no one shall shroud Himself, under pretence Of knowledge, which hath made him proud, Nor seeming penitence. 29. No high profession here can stand, Unless sincerity Hath been therewith commixed, and Brought forth simplicity.[7] 30. No mask nor vizor here can hide The heart that rotten is; All cloaks now must be laid aside, No sinner must have bliss. 31. Though most approve of thee, and count Thee upright in thy heart; Yea, though preferred and made surmount Most men to act thy part, 32. In treading where the godly trod, As to an outward show; Yet this hold still, the grace of God Takes hold on but a few, 33. So as to make them truly such As then shall stand before This Judge with gladness; this is much Yet true for evermore. 34. The tree of life this paradise Doth always beautify, 'Cause <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>health</b> it is the rise And perpetuity. 35. Here stands the golden throne of grace From out of which do run Those crystal streams that make this place Far brighter than the sun. 36. Here stands mount Zion with her king. Jerusalem above, That holy and delightful thing, So beautified with love. 37. That, as a mother succours those Which of her body be, So she far more, all such as close In with her Lord; and she 38. Her grace, her everlasting doors Will open wide unto Them all, with welcome, welcome, poor, Rich, bond, free, high and low, 39. Unto the kingdom which our Lord Appointed hath for all That hath his name and word ador'd; Because he did them call 40. Unto that work, which also they Sincerely did fulfil, Not shunning always to obey His gracious holy will. 41. Besides, this much doth beautify This goodly paradise, That from all quarters, constantly, Whole thousands as the price 42. Of precious blood, do here arrive; As safe escaping all, Sin, hell, and satan did contrive To bring them into thrall. 43. Each telling his deliverance I' th' open face of heaven; Still calling to remembrance How fiercely they were driven 44. By deadly foe, who did pursue As swift as eagles fly; Which if thou have not, down thou must With those that then shall die The second death, and be accurs'd Of God. For certainly, 45. The truth of grace shall only here Without a blush be bold To stand, whilst others quake and fear, And dare not once behold. 46. That heart that here was right for God Shall there be comforted; But those that evil ways have trod, Shall then hang down the head. 47. As sore confounded with the guilt That now upon them lies, Because they did delight in filth And beastly vanities. 48. Or else because they did deceive With hypocritical Disguises, their own souls, and leave Or shun that best of all 49. Approved word of righteousness, They were invited to Embrace, therefore they no access Now to him have, but woe. 50. For every one must now receive According to their ways; They that unto the Lord did cleave, The everlasting joys. 51. Those that did die in wickedness, To execution sent, There still to grapple with distress, Which nothing can prevent. 52. Of which two states I next shall write, Wherefore I pray give ear, And to them bend with all our might Your heart with filial fear.|$|E
