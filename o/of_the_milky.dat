5|$|As {{viewed from}} Earth, the visible region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way's Galactic plane {{occupies}} {{an area of}} the sky that includes 30 constellations.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 a dwarf galaxy, {{also named}} Coma Berenices, was {{discovered}} in the constellation. The galaxy is a faint satellite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way.|$|E
5|$|The galactic plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way {{passes through}} Perseus, but {{is much less}} obvious than {{elsewhere}} in the sky as it is mostly obscured by molecular clouds. The Perseus Arm is a spiral arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way galaxy and stretches across the sky from the constellation Cassiopeia through Perseus and Auriga to Gemini and Monoceros. This segment is towards {{the rim of the}} galaxy.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> rate <b>of</b> star {{formation}} in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way is much higher, with Andromeda Galaxy producing {{only about one}} solar mass per year compared to 3–5 solar masses for <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way. <b>The</b> rate <b>of</b> supernovae in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way is also double that of Andromeda Galaxy. This suggests that the latter once experienced a great {{star formation}} phase, but {{is now in a}} relative state <b>of</b> quiescence, whereas <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way is experiencing more active star formation. Should this continue, the luminosity in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way may eventually overtake that of Andromeda Galaxy.|$|R
25|$|GLIMPSE, the Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire, is {{a survey}} {{spanning}} 300° <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>Milky</b> Way galaxy. It consists of approximately 444,000 images taken at four separate wavelengths using the Infrared Array Camera.|$|R
50|$|A {{supercluster}} is a {{large group}} of smaller galaxy clusters or galaxy groups, which is among <b>the</b> largest-known structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cosmos. <b>The</b> <b>Milky</b> Way is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Local Group galaxy cluster (that contains more than 54 galaxies), which in turn is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Laniakea Supercluster. This supercluster spans over 500 million light-years, while the Local Group spans over 10 million light-years. <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> superclusters in <b>the</b> observable universe is estimated to be 10 million.|$|R
5|$|Actual proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way {{consisting}} of many stars came in 1610 when the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope {{to study the}} Milky Way and discovered that it is composed of {{a huge number of}} faint stars.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the {{collision}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way and Andromeda galaxies should be underway. Although this {{could result in}} the Solar System being ejected from the newly combined galaxy, it is considered unlikely to have any adverse effect on the Sun or planets.|$|E
5|$|NGC 4651, {{about the}} size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way, has tidal stellar streams gravitationally {{stripped}} from a smaller, satellite galaxy. It is about 62 million light-years away.|$|E
25|$|Edwin Hubble (class of 1906), {{astronomer}} who determined <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> galaxies beyond <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way, {{and proposed}} Hubble's Law, which helped in postulating the Expanding Universe Theory. The Hubble Space Telescope was named in his honor.|$|R
25|$|N* is <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> {{stars in}} <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way. This number {{is not well}}-estimated, because <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way's mass is not well estimated. Moreover, there is little {{information}} about <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> very small stars. N* is at least 100 billion, and may {{be as high as}} 500 billion, if there are many low visibility stars.|$|R
50|$|DDO 69 (also {{known as}} Leo A, Leo III, PGC 28868 or UGC 5364) is an {{irregular}} galaxy {{which is located}} in <b>the</b> constellation <b>of</b> Leo. It is a small satellite galaxy <b>of</b> our galaxy, <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way.|$|R
5|$|The Sun lies {{close to}} the inner rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way's Orion Arm, in the Local Interstellar Cloud or the Gould Belt, at a {{distance}} of 7.5–8.5 kpc (25,000–28,000 light-years) from the Galactic Center.|$|E
5|$|The WHT {{has been}} used to make many {{significant}} new discoveries. Some of the more notable include the first evidence of a supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) at the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way (in 1995) and the first optical observation of a gamma-ray burst (GRB 970228) (in 1997).|$|E
5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy may be {{the same}} size as the Milky Way but has a visible star count of only 1% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way. The lack of {{luminosity}} is because there is a lack of star-forming gas in the galaxy which results in old stellar populations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{absolute}} magnitude (in <b>the</b> blue) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sombrero Galaxy {{is estimated to}} be -21.9 at [...] (-21.8 at <b>the</b> average distance <b>of</b> above), that as stated above makes it the brightest galaxy within a radius <b>of</b> [...] around <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way.|$|R
2500|$|A {{civilization in}} {{possession}} <b>of</b> energy on <b>the</b> scale <b>of</b> its own galaxy, with energy consumption at ≈4 erg/sec. [...] Lemarchand stated {{this as a}} civilization {{with access to the}} power comparable to <b>the</b> luminosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>Milky</b> Way galaxy, about 4 erg/sec (4×1037 watts).|$|R
5|$|Kinematic studies <b>of</b> {{matter in}} <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way and other galaxies have {{demonstrated}} {{that there is more}} mass than can be accounted for by visible matter. A dark matter halo appears to dominate the mass, although <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> this dark matter remains undetermined.|$|R
5|$|As {{the more}} massive stars appear, they {{transform}} the cloud into an H II region (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The stellar wind and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse, often leaving behind {{one or more}} young open clusters of stars. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{prominence}} of large elliptical and spiral galaxies, most galaxies in the Universe are dwarf galaxies. These galaxies are relatively small when compared with other galactic formations, being about one hundredth the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way, containing only a few billion stars. Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies have recently been discovered that are only 100parsecs across.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1995, the Pyxis {{globular}} cluster is a 13.3 ± 1.3 billion year-old {{globular cluster}} situated around 130,000 light-years distant from Earth and around 133,000 light-years {{distant from the}} centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way—a region not previously thought to contain globular clusters. Located in the galactic halo, it was noted to lie on the same plane as the Large Magellanic Cloud and the possibility has been raised {{that it might be}} an escaped object from that galaxy.|$|E
40|$|In {{this letter}} {{we show that}} {{primordial}} minihalos with vcir < 20 km s − 1 stop accreting gas after reionization, as is usually assumed, but in virtue of their increasing concentration and <b>the</b> decreasing temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intergalactic medium as redshift decreases, they have a recent phase of gas accretion and possibly star formation. We expect that some pre-reionization fossils that evolved on <b>the</b> outskirts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way will have a bimodal star formation history with an old and a younger population of stars. Leo T fits perfectly with this scenario. Another prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model is <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> a population of gas rich minihalos that never formed stars. A subset of compact high-velocity clouds may be identified as such objects but <b>the</b> bulk <b>of</b> them may still be undiscovered.

50|$|DR 6 is {{a cluster}} <b>of</b> stars in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way galaxy, {{composed}} of dust, gas, and about 10 large newborn stars, each roughly ten to twenty times <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun. It {{was discovered by}} astronomers at NASA with the Spitzer Space Telescope, viewing the nebula using infrared light.|$|R
50|$|Andromeda is {{approximately}} 220,000 light years across, {{and it is}} <b>the</b> largest galaxy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Local Group, which also contains <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way, <b>the</b> Triangulum Galaxy, and other smaller galaxies. Despite earlier findings that suggested that <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way contains more dark matter and could be {{the largest in the}} grouping, the 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed that Andromeda contains one trillion (1012) stars: at least twice <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> stars in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way, which is estimated to be 200-400 billion. <b>The</b> mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Andromeda Galaxy is estimated to be 1.5 solar masses, while <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way is estimated to be 8.5 solar masses.|$|R
5|$|Evolutionary {{studies of}} {{globular}} clusters {{can also be}} used to determine changes due to the starting composition of the gas and dust that formed the cluster. That is, the evolutionary tracks change with changes in the abundance of heavy elements. The data obtained from studies of globular clusters are then used to study the evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, when Hooker Telescope was completed, the {{prevailing}} view still {{was that the}} Universe consisted entirely <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way Galaxy. Using the Hooker Telescope, Edwin Hubble identified Cepheid variables in several spiral nebulae and in 1922–1923 proved conclusively that Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum among others, were entire galaxies outside our own, thus proving that Universe consists of multitude of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 {{a debate}} {{took place between}} Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis (the Great Debate), {{concerning}} the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way, spiral nebulae, and {{the dimensions of the}} Universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula is an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the Milky Way, as well as the significant Doppler shift.|$|E
50|$|As galaxies {{approach}} <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> crossing this cosmological event horizon, {{the light}} from them will {{become more and more}} redshifted, {{to the point where the}} wavelength becomes too large to detect in practice and the galaxies appear to vanish completely (see Future of an expanding universe). <b>The</b> Earth, <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way, and <b>the</b> Local Group <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> way is a part, would all remain virtually undisturbed as <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe recedes and disappears from view. In this scenario, the Local Group would ultimately suffer heat death, just as was hypothesized for the flat, matter-dominated universe before measurements of cosmic acceleration.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{application}} of Gaussian processes to <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> discovering “damped Lyman-α systems ” (DLAs), dense regions of hydrogen gas that are likely <b>the</b> birthplace <b>of</b> galaxies like <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way. We apply this method to a large spectroscopic survey <b>of</b> quasars from <b>the</b> Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III). ...|$|R
25|$|Stars and {{interstellar}} gas {{are bound}} by gravity to form galaxies, and groups of galaxies can be bound by gravity in galaxy clusters. With <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> stars in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way and <b>the</b> galaxies in the Local Group, almost all galaxies are moving away from us due to <b>the</b> expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to detecting extrasolar planets, SIM {{would have helped}} astronomers construct a map <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way galaxy. Other important tasks would have included collecting data to help pinpoint stellar masses for specific types of stars, assisting in {{the determination of the}} spatial distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way and in the local group of galaxies and using the gravitational microlensing effect to measure the mass of stars.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge {{with what is}} {{believed}} to be a supermassive black hole at its center. This is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from the core. This is a region of active star formation that contains many younger, population I stars. The disk is surrounded by a spheroid halo of older, population II stars, as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|NGC 362 {{is another}} {{globular}} cluster in Tucana with an apparent magnitude of 6.4, 27,700 light-years from Earth. Like neighboring 47 Tucanae, NGC 362 is a Shapley class III cluster {{and among the}} brightest globular clusters in the sky. Unusually for a globular cluster, its orbit takes it {{very close to the}} center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way—approximately 3,000 light-years. It was discovered in the 1820s by James Dunlop. Its stars become visible at 180x magnification through a telescope.|$|E
5|$|The {{globular}} cluster Palomar 5, for example, is near <b>the</b> apogalactic point <b>of</b> its orbit after passing through <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way. Streams <b>of</b> stars extend outward {{toward the front}} and rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbital path <b>of</b> this cluster, stretching out to distances of 13,000 light-years. Tidal interactions have stripped away much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mass from Palomar 5, and further interactions as it passes through the galactic core are expected to transform it into a long stream <b>of</b> stars orbiting <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way halo.|$|R
500|$|In Chinese mythology, {{there is}} a love story of Qi Xi (...) in which Niu Lang ( [...] , Altair) and his two {{children}} (β and γ Aquilae) are separated from their mother Zhi Nü ( [...] , lit. [...] "Weaving Girl", Vega) who is on <b>the</b> far side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river, <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way. However, one day per year on <b>the</b> seventh day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventh month <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese lunisolar calendar, magpies make a bridge so that Niu Lang and Zhi Nü can be together again for a brief encounter. The Japanese Tanabata festival, in which Vega is known as orihime (織姫), is also based on this legend.|$|R
50|$|His work {{consisted}} <b>of</b> assisting with <b>the</b> parallax {{program and}} continuing the proper motion {{work that he}} and Alden had begun. Van de Kamp and Alexander N.
