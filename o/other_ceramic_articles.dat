40|$|Directive 84 / 500 /EEC and its {{amendments}} {{establish the}} requirements for the commercialisation of <b>ceramic</b> <b>articles</b> intended to {{come into contact with}} foodstuffs, in order to guarantee that they do not constitute a risk for consumers and to establish the maximum limits of migration for cadmium and lead. In this respect, in the light of developments in scientific knowledge, it is advisable to review the lead and cadmium limits and the test conditions. Therefore, the European Commission is assessing the amendment of said Directive. The Scientific Committee has assessed a proposal regarding criteria for the estimation of concentrations for the discussion of proposals for migration limits of certain heavy metals and <b>other</b> elements from <b>ceramic</b> <b>articles</b> intended to come into contact with foodstuffs. It has assessed whether the criteria used in the preparation of the proposal are adequate, considering them to be acceptable except in two cases, for which it has put forward the application of alternative criteria...|$|R

40|$|A {{process for}} slip casting <b>ceramic</b> <b>articles</b> {{that does not}} employ parting agents and affords the casting of complete, detailed, {{precision}} articles that do not possess parting lines is presented. This process is especially useful for high temperature superconductors and water-sensitive ceramics. A wax pattern for a shell mold is provided, and an aqueous mixture of a calcium sulfate-bonded investment material is applied as a coating to the wax pattern. The coated wax pattern is then dried, followed by curing to vaporize the wax pattern and leave a shell mold of the calcium sulfate-bonded investment material. The shell mold is cooled to room temperature, and a ceramic slip, created by dispersing a ceramic powder in an organic liquid, is poured therein. After a ceramic shell of desired thickness or a solid article has {{set up in the}} shell mold, excess ceramic slip is poured out. The shell mold is misted with water and peeled away from the <b>ceramic</b> <b>article,</b> after which the ceramic is fired to provide a complete, detailed, precision, high temperature superconductive <b>ceramic</b> <b>article</b> without parting lines.

40|$|This is {{a review}} of acid {{aluminum}} phosphate for the binding and coating of materials. The acid aluminum phosphate {{in the form of}} a solution obtained by dissolving aluminum hydroxide in phosphoric acid, with a P/Al molar ratio of 23, is effective for the binding of fibrous or particulate materials. Porous <b>ceramic</b> <b>articles</b> are made using this binder by wet forming, followed by heat treatment. The binder resides at the junction of the adjacent fibers in the porous fibrous <b>ceramic</b> <b>article.</b> No free binder was observed in fibrous or particulate articles. The porosity is 45 %– 90 % in fibrous articles, and is 25 %– 82 % in particulate articles. Porosity above 61 % in particulate articles is attained by adding carbon particles and subsequent removal of them by combustion. The binder proportion is 3 – 10 wt % in fibrous articles, and is ∼ 0. 1 wt % in particulate <b>articles.</b> Porous <b>ceramic</b> <b>articles</b> made using a silica binder instead of the acid aluminum phosphate binder are inferior in permeability, mechanical properties and creep resistance, and exhibit a wider pore size distribution. Free silica binder was observed in articles made with the silica binder. The acid aluminum phosphate with a P/Al ratio of 12 or 23 is also effective for coating materials, particularly graphite for the purpose of oxidation protection.

40|$|The colour {{overglaze}} {{of ceramic}} dinnerware may contain heavy metals like lead and cadmium. Depending {{on whether the}} ceramics were fired at high or low temperatures {{and what kind of}} foods are stored in them for what periods of time, heavy metals may be transferred. Ingested by humans, these heavy metals can cause adverse health effects. Children are particularly at risk. Vessels, from which lead and cadmium may be transferred, are described as articles from which a migration of lead or cadmium is possible. In order to prevent consumers being harmed by a lead or cadmium migration from ceramic vessels, maximum quantities of lead and cadmium transferred from <b>ceramic</b> <b>articles</b> were laid down on the European level in 1984. According to them, certain ceramic vessels may only transfer up to four milligrammes lead per litre. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) subjected the valid limits to a risk assessment. It was prompted to do this by the review of the European Directive on <b>ceramic</b> <b>articles</b> intended to come into contact with foodstuffs. Risk assessment gets {{complicated by the fact that}} no adequate data are available on how many consumers come into contact with heavy metals and to what extent. However, there is no doubt about it that specific population-groups can have a larger dietary intake of heavy metals because of their eating habits and lifestyle. Therefore, additional exposure via migration of lead or cadmium from ceramics should be reduced to a minimum. Regarding the valid limits of the EU the Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI) laid down by the World Health Organisation (WHO) may be considerably exceeded, depending on the calculation model. Particularly in view of the higher sensitivity of children, BfR recommends reducing the statutory limits for the migration of lead and cadmium from <b>ceramic</b> <b>articles...</b>|$|R
