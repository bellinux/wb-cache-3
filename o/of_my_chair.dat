500|$|After the London Paralympics, Dodd took up {{wheelchair}} basketball. She {{started for}} the Sydney University Flames in the Women's National Wheelchair Basketball League in 2013. She has to strap her fingers and wrists, and usually dislocates a shoulder during a game. [...] "I've had a few bangs and scrapes and been tipped out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> a few times," [...] she concedes, [...] "but it's really fun. The fast pace really gives you an adrenalin kick and the girls I play with are awesome." [...] "If I have chose between my two sports for Rio," [...] she said, [...] "I will go with basketball." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{stopped in}} front <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> and stood looking down at me with an {{expression}} in which I read a contemptuous amazement.|$|E
60|$|He checked {{himself in}} glancing towards {{the window to}} look where the wind was and leaned on the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> instead.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{exhausted}} by his efforts and {{the worse for}} liquor," [...] Montgomery answered with a laugh. [...] "On the whole, I think you had better let him sleep. Perhaps you remarked {{that some of the}} glass is broken and two <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chairs</b> are smashed!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Master Robert," [...] gasped Edwards, {{sitting down}} and panting vehemently, after having {{extinguished}} the flames, [...] "wot have you been a-doin' of?" [...] I was standing speechless in the midst <b>of</b> <b>my</b> upset <b>chair,</b> table, and books, glaring wildly, when the man said this.|$|R
6000|$|... "Empty words, are they, my Lord Abbot! Well, I {{tell you}} that they are all written down and signed in due form. I tell you I had {{witnesses}} you knew naught of who heard them with their ears. Here stands one <b>of</b> them behind <b>my</b> <b>chair.</b> Is it not so, Jeffrey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I felt my hand tremble as it {{gripped the}} top rail <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> but I managed {{to command the}} voice to answer, coldly enough: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{gripped the}} sides <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair.</b> I felt my breath coming shorter. A cry. I {{could not keep}} it back from my quivering lips.|$|E
60|$|With {{my heart}} beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I rose out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> and stood {{with my hand}} upon the back of it, looking wildly at him.|$|E
60|$|I {{have already}} told {{the reader that}} there were two strong staples fixed upon that side <b>of</b> <b>my</b> box which had no window, and into which the servant, who used to carry me on horseback, would put a leathern belt, and buckle it about his waist. Being in this disconsolate state, I heard, or at least thought I heard, some kind of grating noise on that side <b>of</b> <b>my</b> box where the staples were fixed; and soon after I began to fancy that the box was pulled or towed along the sea; for I now and then felt a sort of tugging, which made the waves rise near the tops <b>of</b> <b>my</b> windows, leaving me almost in the dark. This gave me some faint hopes of relief, {{although}} I was not able to imagine how it could be brought about. I ventured to unscrew one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chairs,</b> which were always fastened to the floor; and having made a hard shift to screw it down again, directly under the slipping-board that I had lately opened, I mounted on the <b>chair,</b> and putting <b>my</b> mouth as near as I could to the hole, I called for help in a loud voice, and in all the languages I understood. I then fastened my handkerchief to a stick I usually carried, and thrusting it up the hole, waved it several times in the air, that if any boat or ship were near, the seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up in the box.|$|R
60|$|Ere I {{had brought}} up my lee-way, James {{appeared}} with his summons to our frugal supper--radishes, cheese, {{and a bottle}} of the old ale-only two plates though--and no chair set for Mr. Darsie, by the attentive James Wilkinson. Said James, with his long face, lank hair, and very long pig-tail in its leathern strap, was placed, as usual, at the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>chair,</b> upright as a wooden sentinel at the door of a puppet-show. 'You may go down, James,' said my father; and exit Wilkinson.--What is to come next? thought I; for the weather is not clear on the paternal brow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good, Monkbarns--excellent! But I do {{not take}} the sword up as justice, but as a soldier--indeed I should rather say the musket and bayonet--there they stand at the elbow <b>of</b> <b>my</b> gouty <b>chair,</b> for I am scarce fit for drill yet--a slight touch of our old {{acquaintance}} podagra; I can keep my feet, however, while our sergeant puts me through the manual. I should like to know, Captain M'Intyre, if he follows the regulations correctly--he brings us but awkwardly to the present." [...] And he hobbled towards his weapon to illustrate his doubts and display his proficiency.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother thinks," [...] {{explained}} Miss Haldin, {{standing between}} us, {{with one hand}} resting on the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> [...] "that my poor brother perhaps {{did not try to}} save himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, you weary me." [...] I seated myself, {{and flung}} a {{leg over the}} arm <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair.</b> [...] "Shall {{we come to the}} {{alternative}} For I assume you have one." ...|$|E
60|$|I sat there, tense, {{gripping}} the arms <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair.</b> I was tingling. Something {{was happening to}} me. I had a curious sensation {{of being on the}} threshold of something wonderful and perilous.|$|E
40|$|ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I {{would like}} to {{recognize}} the willingness <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dissertation <b>chair,</b> Lane Fischer, who has helped me with this project and graciously gave of his time and efforts so that this research could materialize. Lane had the original idea to conduct this research {{and was able to}} collect the interviews for interpretation. As circumstances materialized, I was able to pick up this project and develop this dissertation. I am grateful for Rachel Crook-Lyon and her assistance as my auditor to help me revise my results and discussion sections. I would also like to recognize the other members <b>of</b> <b>my</b> committee, Aaron Jackson, Ellie Young, and P. Scott Richards for their contributions and advice in preparing this dissertation at {{every step of the way}} for final revisions...|$|R
6000|$|SIR,--I {{have just}} been sent an article {{that seems to have}} {{appeared}} in your paper some days ago, {164} in which it is stated that, in the course of some remarks addressed to the Playgoers' Club on the occasion <b>of</b> <b>my</b> taking the <b>chair</b> at their last meeting, I laid it down as an axiom that the stage is only 'a frame furnished with a set of puppets.' ...|$|R

60|$|She {{was seated}} on the arm <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair.</b> She drew back her head with a smile {{trembling}} on her lips, with a lustre burning in her eyes like a vigil--a vigil for me.|$|E
6000|$|Our eyes met, but I {{could not}} stand his inquiring glance and looked down. He came to me, and sitting on the arm <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> {{put his hand on}} my {{shoulder}} and said affectionately,-- ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was leaning}} against the arm <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair.</b> It was clearly my duty to {{administer}} the consolation which the situation demanded. I realized, however, that the occasion was critical, and I ignored her proximity.|$|E
6000|$|And so I have valued <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> ever since, [...] Like {{the shrine}} of a saint, or the throne of a prince; [...] Saint Fanny, my patroness sweet I declare, [...] The queen <b>of</b> <b>my</b> heart and <b>my</b> cane-bottom'd <b>chair.</b>|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to thank the members <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{committee}} <b>chair,</b> Robert Patterson, for his guidance and patience with me in completing this project. To Lisa Fournier, for posing intriguing questions and for her reassurance. To, Craig Parks, thank you for taking the time with me to help me with developing a greater understanding of statistics and methodology. I would also like to thank Jim Gaska at the United States Air Force Research Lab in Mesa Arizona for assisting in the development of the stimuli used for this thesis. For my lab mate, Alan Boydstun, thanks for pointing out just how useful Flash can be. Lastly, I {{would like to}} thank my wife, Deirdre, for putting up with me while I completed this project. iii CYCLOPEAN MOTION AFTEREFFECTS USING SPIRAL PATTERNS...|$|R

60|$|He {{was close}} {{by my side}} now, and his hand was resting on the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair.</b> I laid mine upon it for a moment; it was cold as ice, and shaking. The old madness was upon him indeed.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{came out}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> work as <b>chair</b> <b>of</b> the European Design-for-all and Assistive Technology Standardisation Co-ordination Group (a working {{group of the}} European ICT {{standards}} board) and described {{the difference between the}} requirements for older and disabled people to use mainstream products and the lack of provision of accessible useable technology.

6000|$|The king, who, as I before observed, was {{a prince}} of {{excellent}} understanding, would frequently order that I {{should be brought}} in my box, and set upon the table in his closet: he would then command me to bring one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chairs</b> out <b>of</b> the box, and sit down within three yards distance upon {{the top of the}} cabinet, which brought me almost to a level with his face. In this manner I had several conversations with him. I one day took the freedom to tell his majesty, “that the contempt he discovered towards Europe, {{and the rest of the}} world, did not seem answerable to those excellent qualities of mind that he was master of; that reason did not extend itself with the bulk of the body; on the contrary, we observed in our country, that the tallest persons were usually the least provided with it; that among other animals, bees and ants had the reputation of more industry, art, and sagacity, than many of the larger kinds; and that, as inconsiderable as he took me to be, I hoped I might live to do his majesty some signal service.” The king heard me with attention, and began to conceive a much better opinion of me than he had ever before. He desired “I would give him as exact an account of the government of England as I possibly could; because, as fond as princes commonly are of their own customs (for so he conjectured of other monarchs, by my former discourses), he should be glad to hear of any thing that might deserve imitation.” ...|$|R
40|$|The {{writing of}} a {{dissertation}} {{can be a}} lonely and isolating experience, yet it is obviously not possible without the personal and practical support of numerous people. Thus my sincere gratitude goes to my parents and family, all my old friends in Poland, all new fiends and classmates for their love, support, and patience {{over the last few}} years. Big appreciation goes to my best friend since ever Arika Ligmann-Zielinska for always being there for me and an unconditional support. I am appreciative and thankful for the support <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dissertation <b>chair</b> and supervisor, Professor David Hui, and the Members <b>of</b> <b>my</b> Committee, Professors Paul Herrington, Ting Wang, Bhaskar Kura, and Dongming Wei. Without their support this dissertation would not have been written. I would like to thank Prof. Hui for offering me graduate research assistantship and the possibility to travel and visit other research centers and facilities and attend the ICCE conference. The warmest thanks go to his wife, Ms...|$|R
60|$|What {{need to tell}} me that! I {{had never}} seen one of that kind in all my life, but I {{knew what they were}} and for what purpose they had come. I grasped the elbows <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> and neither spoke nor moved.|$|E
6000|$|And just then, peeping {{round the}} corner <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> {{to see if there}} were any signs of cake, what should I see but a great beastly brute of a rat. It was {{standing}} right beside the visitor, drinking milk out of a saucer, if you please! ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was still}} {{standing}} by the bed, and now stooped down (but still with the same discontented face) and kissed Ada.

40|$|I am {{delighted to}} have the {{opportunity}} to acknowledge the superiority of the PhD program at Seton Hall University. Throughout my tenure here, I have been continually impressed by the quality of the faculty and the doctoral work submitted by my colleagues. Seton Hall University’s doctoral program is one of the few PhD programs offered part time and lends support to the idea that part time doctoral students can make significant contributions to nursing knowledge and may be more readily positioned to translate the knowledge gained to their work environments. I want to also recognize the expertise and commitment <b>of</b> <b>my</b> previous <b>Chair,</b> Dr. Theodora Sirota, for her tireless dedication of her time and expertise toward the quality of this study, and Dr. Pamela Galehouse, <b>my</b> current <b>Chair,</b> for assuming the lead at the time of her departure. Also mentionable, was the guidance of Dr. Martin Edwards, a statistician at Seton Hall University. I would also like to acknowledge my committee members, Dr. Marie Foley for her guidance and appreciative critiques <b>of</b> <b>my</b> work and Dr. Marian Turkel for the provision of her caring expertise to enrich my understanding and application of Watson’s theory of human caring (Watson, 2005, 2008). Attesting to her actualization of thi...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{would not}} have been written {{if it were not for}} the guidance and support <b>of</b> <b>my</b> committee <b>chair,</b> Rich Thomason. Rich is a tireless adviser and mentor. During my first seminar with him way back in 2004 and then again throughout the time he served as <b>my</b> committee <b>chair,</b> we would meet every week at his insistence. And I would write every week at his insistence. And he would provide comments every week. Rich is a model professor in our profession, especially when it comes to advising students and treating them as colleagues, even those of us who have much to learn. Thank you, Rich, for making this possible. I would also like to thank the other members <b>of</b> <b>my</b> committee. Andy Egan is a saint when it comes to graduate student advising. His prompt comments and discussions over coffee and beer helped keep me engaged when all I wanted to do was stop. Eric Swanson is new to my committee, but he is already a valuable asset to both my dissertation and my philosophical development. Acrisio Pires was there when I defended my prospectus and had useful advice for me as I went forward. I regret not being able to interact with him more...|$|R
