40|$|We {{present a}} {{high-order}} shifted Gegenbauer pseudospectral method (SGPM) to solve numerically the second-order one-dimensional hyperbolic telegraph equation provided with some initial and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The {{framework of the}} numerical scheme involves the recast of the problem into its integral formulation followed by its discretization into a system of well-conditioned linear algebraic equations. The integral operators are numerically approximated using some novel shifted Gegenbauer <b>operational</b> matrices of <b>integration.</b> We derive the error formula of the associated numerical quadratures. We also present a method to optimize the constructed <b>operational</b> matrix of <b>integration</b> by minimizing the associated quadrature error in some optimality sense. We study the error bounds and convergence of the optimal shifted Gegenbauer <b>operational</b> matrix of <b>integration.</b> Moreover, we construct {{the relation between the}} <b>operational</b> matrices of <b>integration</b> of the shifted Gegenbauer polynomials and standard Gegenbauer polynomials.

Four numerical test examples have been carried out in order to verify the effectiveness, the accuracy, and the exponential convergence of the method.

40|$|Fractional {{calculus}} is {{an extension}} of derivatives and integrals to non-integer orders, and a partial differential equation involving the fractional calculus operators is called the fractional PDE. They have many applications in science and engineering. However not only the analytical solution existed for a limited number of cases, but also the numerical methods are very complicated and difficult. In this paper, we newly establish the simulation method based on the operational matrices of the orthogonal functions. We formulate the <b>operational</b> matrix of <b>integration</b> in a unified framework. By using the <b>operational</b> matrix of <b>integration,</b> we propose a new numerical method for linear fractional partial differential equation solving. In the method, we (1) use the Haar wavelet; (2) establish a Lyapunov-type matrix equation; and (3) obtain the algebraic equations suitable for computer programming. Two examples are given to demonstrate the simplicity, clarity and powerfulness of the new method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
