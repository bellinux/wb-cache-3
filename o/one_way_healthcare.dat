40|$|The {{rising cost}} of {{healthcare}} {{is one of the}} major concerns faced by the nation. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> to lower <b>healthcare</b> costs and provide better quality care to patients is through the effective use of Information Technology (IT). Data sharing and collaboration and large-scale management of healthcare data have been identified as important IT challenges to advance the nation’s healthcare system. In this paper, we present an overview of the software framework called CDN (Collaborative Data Network) that we are developing for large-scale sharing of electronic health records (EHR). In this on-going effort, we focus on sharing EHRs of cancer patients. Cancer is the second leading cause of deaths in the US. CDN is based on the synergistic combination of peer-to-peer technology and the extensible markup language XML and XQuery. We outline the key challenges that arise when sharing evolving, heterogeneous repositories and processing queries across multiple repositories. We present the novel architecture of CDN to overcome these challenges and discuss our plan for implementation, evaluation, and deployment...|$|R

Healthcare organisations are charged with overseeing the clinical governance of NMP and guidance recommends the identification of a lead director to be responsible for its implementation.

Several studies have explored the barriers to NMP at a practice level, however {{little is known about the}} role the NMP lead and the implementation of NMP from an organisational perspective. The aim of this research was to explore the role of the organisational NMP lead across a range of practice settings within one Strategic Health Authority (SHA) and consider the development of NMP from a multi-organisational perspective. Methods Semi-structured telephone interviews with 28 NMP leads across one SHA were undertaken by a trained qualitative researcher. Interviews addressed the purpose of the role and difficulties encountered; audiotapes were transcribed, coded and themes were identified. Results The NMP lead role comprised of four main functions; communication, coordinating, clinical governance and support. Factors hampering progress in overseeing the safe development of NMP included lack of clarity about the NMP lead role and responsibilities, strategic support and a lack of protected time. The extent to which clinical governance systems were in place across organisations was inconsistent. Where a strategic approach to its development was adopted, fewer barriers were encountered and NMP was more likely to become embedded within organisations. Conclusions The significant contribution that NMP leads play in embedding NMP within organisations should be acknowledged by clearer national guidance for this role and its responsibilities. Greater standardisation and consistency is required of clinical governance systems if quality and safety is to be ensured given the expanding development of NMP. The extent to which NMP is in place worldwide differs. However, our findings will be of interest to policymakers in other countries involved in the development and implementation of this role. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Although {{attention}} to healthcare ethics {{in rural areas}} has increased, specific focus on rural palliative care is still largely under-studied and under-theorized. The {{purpose of this study}} was to gain a deeper understanding of the values informing good palliative care from rural individuals' perspectives. Methods We conducted a qualitative ethnographic study in four rural communities in Western Canada. Each community had a population of 10, 000 or less and was located at least a three hour travelling distance by car from a specialist palliative care treatment centre. Data were collected over a 2 -year period and included 95 interviews, 51 days of field work and 74 hours of direct participant observation where the researchers accompanied rural healthcare providers. Data were analyzed inductively to identify the most prevalent thematic values, and then coded using NVivo. Results This study illuminated the core values of knowing and being known, being present and available, and community and mutuality that provide the foundation for ethically good rural palliative care. These values were congruent across the study communities and across the stakeholders involved in rural palliative care. Although these were highly prized values, each came with a corresponding ethical tension. Being known often resulted in a loss of privacy. Being available and present created a high degree of expectation and potential caregiver strain. The values of community and mutuality created entitlement issues, presenting daunting challenges for coordinated change. Conclusions The values identified in this study offer the opportunity to better understand common ethical tensions that arise in rural healthcare and key differences between rural and urban palliative care. In particular, these values shed light on problematic health system and health policy changes. When initiatives violate deeply held values and hard won rural capacity to address the needs of their dying members is undermined, there are long lasting negative consequences. The social fabric of rural life is frayed. These findings offer <b>one</b> <b>way</b> to re-conceptualize <b>healthcare</b> decision making through consideration of critical values to support ethically good palliative care in rural settings. </p...|$|R
