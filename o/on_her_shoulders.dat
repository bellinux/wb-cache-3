Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs {{on the bottom of}} her dress.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage {{to look at all}} the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, a monkey, a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts it <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes {{in the middle of the}} room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, she closes her eyes again and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E
5|$|The Aboriginal group {{forms the}} inner centre {{piece in the}} tondo of both bowls. As the same image was used for both bowls, the {{implication}} is that the Chinese ceramic painters were copying from the same drawing and finishing them at the same place and time. The image is of a group of four Aboriginal men with club, shield and spears, one woman with a baby <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> – standing and turned slightly away {{from the rest of the}} figures – and another woman cowed by the men. This is thought to depict a preliminary marriage ceremony. As with the Museum bowl's Sydney Cove image, no directly related, surviving, version is known that would have been used by the ceramic artists to paint the Aboriginal group. The closest match is a drawing after an apparently now-lost original sketch by Nicolas-Martin Petit, artist on the 1800–1803 French expedition to Australia led by Nicolas Baudin. Research made around 2009–2012, indicated that during Baudin's expedition, a report was prepared for Emperor Napoleon on the feasibility of capturing the British colony at Sydney Cove. As this expedition progressed around coastal Australia, Petit began to specialise in the drawing of portraits of indigenous peoples. The French expedition arrived at Port Jackson on 25April 1802. Petit's drawing was copied for publication as plate 114 in the Voyage autour du monde : entrepris par ordre du roi (Paris, 1825) , regarding a voyage around the world (1817–1820) led by Louis-Claude de Saulces de Freycinet. The engraving is entitled Port Jackson, Nlle Hollande. Ceremonie preliminaire d'un mariage, chez les sauvages (ceremony before a marriage among the natives, Port Jackson, New Holland). Port Jackson aborigines are from the Eora group of indigenous people living in the Sydney Basin.|$|E
5|$|As many {{as eight}} males will be at a mating site, staying in close {{vicinity}} to the receptive female. The female seems to choose the male she mates with, and the males compete {{for the attention of}} the female with a significant amount of vocalization and antagonistic interactions. The female may choose to mate with several of the males, and her choice of mate {{does not seem to have}} any correlation to the physical appearance of the males. To stimulate the male to mount her, she gives a series of mewling vocalizations. The male mounts from behind, resting his body on her slightly off-center, a position requiring delicate balance; if the female were to stand, the male would have significant difficulty continuing. He places his paws <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> or grasps her around the waist and often licks her neck. Mating may last for nearly three hours. This unusually lengthy mating is due to the physical nature of the male's erect penis, which has backwards-pointing spines along most of its length. Fossa mating includes a copulatory tie, which may be enforced by the male's spiny penis. The tie is difficult to break if the mating session is interrupted. Copulation with a single male may be repeated several times, with a total mating time of up to fourteen hours, while the male may remain with the female for up to an hour after the mating. A single female may occupy the tree for up to a week, mating with multiple males over that time. Also, other females may take her place, mating with some of the same males as well as others. This mating strategy, whereby the females monopolize a site and maximize the available number of mates, seems to be unique among carnivores. Recent research suggests that this system helps the fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate-finding, such as low population density and lack of den use.|$|E

Roger Ebert gave the film 1 star out of 4 and said that it [...] "takes the tepid achievement of Twilight, guts it, and leaves it for undead."

500|$|The player {{controls}} Ōkami Amaterasu, {{the goddess}} of the sun, {{in the form of}} a white wolf. Amaterasu is referred to in the Japanese and European version of the game as a female, while in the North American version she was genderless although she is referred as the [...] "mother of all". While Amaterasu, when endowed with ink power, is seen by the player with red markings, cloud-like fur <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and weapons on her back, most of the human characters in the game only see her as a plain white wolf; some believe Amaterasu to be the reincarnation of Shiranui (the white wolf that fought Orochi 100 years prior to the game's present), and do not recognize her spiritual nature. If the player depletes their power by overuse of the celestial brush, Amaterasu will temporarily revert to this mundane white form. Issun, an arrogant, inch-tall [...] "wandering artist" [...] seeking out the thirteen Celestial Brush techniques for himself, accompanies Amaterasu (whom he calls [...] "Ammy" [...] or [...] "furball"), and serves as a guide, dialogue [...] and as comic relief.

Unsatisfied, he [...] tries to rape her, {{prompting}} her to kill him by puncturing his skull with her tongue. She then tries {{to mate with}} John Carey (Whip Hubley), a man she meets after a car accident. They swim in Carey's pool where Sil forces him to open his swimming trunks in order to mate, but he refuses. This act is interrupted by Preston and Laura. She kills Carey, morphing into her alien form, a bipedal mutant with tentacles <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> and back, and flees naked into a forest without being seen by the team. She pretends to be a rape victim to kidnap a woman (Marliese K. Schneider) in order to assume her identity. Sitting in the car near Carey's home, she reads Fitch's lips, as she had done earlier, learning of their plan to stake out the Nightclub for her return. There, she is seen by Dan, prompting a car chase.

Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com praised the subtle and refreshing humour, noting that [...] "Gowariker shows a flair for light scenes and creating atmospheric nuances" [...] but criticising the loopy screenplay. Verma called it [...] "ultimately a performance-oriented film", stating: [...] "A terrific ensemble cast {{from the world of}} television and theatre collaborate to its feel-good believability which lasts as long as their screen time." [...] She particularly praised Chopra's performance and wrote: [...] "Priyanka Chopra transforms into 12 new skins with astonishing distinction, voice and spirit. The actress reinvents herself into this unique individual every single time ranging from batty, bashful and boisterous. This is simply her show." [...] Sonia Chopra of Sify also gave a mixed review, noting that the film could have been hugely entertaining but was affected by [...] "a repetitive layout and agonising length". She believed that the film was watchable because of Priyanka Chopra's [...] "consistently stellar act"; she carried the film ably <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> and gave [...] "a fun and uninhibited performance." [...] Namrata Joshi of Outlook gave the film 2 stars out of 4. She thought that Chopra played her characters [...] "competently, confidently but a bit unevenly" [...] and wrote: [...] "The one trump card for the film is the new queen bee Priyanka Chopra.

500|$|The finale {{introduces}} parallel-universe {{versions of}} familiar characters, including the Fauxlivia version of Olivia Dunham, both played by actress Anna Torv. One {{topic of conversation}} among fans, journalists, and those working on the show was what to call the alternate Olivia to differentiate the two. Names varied, with many using [...] "Fauxlivia", [...] "Bolivia", and/or [...] "Altlivia". The writers chose Fauxlivia because {{a character in a}} season three episode referred to her as such. Torv and Akiva Goldsman discussed various ways to differentiate the two depictions of Olivia; ultimately two different physical demeanors were created. Torv wanted to make the new character [...] "completely different", but she and Goldsman recognized that the two share some major similarities, as they both are in the same profession and are [...] "fundamentally, genetically really the same person." [...] According to Torv, Fauxlivia holds herself differently and has [...] "a different silhouette. She's got a little firefighter, a little military in her." [...] Torv further explained, [...] "Olivia wants to be the best, but [...] just wants to win;" [...] "There's just a front-footedness I think to , simply because she just doesn't carry {{the weight of the world}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> like Olivia does. Olivia's mum died when she was really little, and 's mum is still around. There's lots of little, subtle differences." [...] The producers discussed cutting her hair, but ultimately decided on the auburn hair color to differentiate her. They also made her [...] "a little bit more playful". Pinkner describes shooting the Fauxlivia scenes in the DVD audio commentary: [...] "When [...] first showed up on set in this different guise, she had really embodied this other character in a very playful and sexy way. She turned a lot of heads." [...] Goldsman remarked that Torv's depiction of Fauxlivia was actually much closer to the actress' real personality than her performance as Olivia. The producers were so pleased with her Fauxlivia depiction that they thought [...] "it really opened up a bunch of possibilities... it went from 'let's see if this experiment works' to 'how can we get more of this? ...|$|E
