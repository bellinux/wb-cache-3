25|$|I am {{very fond}} of jazz music, and I swear by all the devils in the nether regions that every person shall be spared in whose home a jazz band {{is in full swing}} at the time I have just mentioned. If {{everyone}} has a jazz band going, well, then, so much the better for you people. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> and that is that some of your people who do not jazz it out on that specific Tuesday night (if there be any) will get the axe.|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximate}} 1000 feet long, {{was released}} on July 8, 1910. Theaters in Indiana and Pennsylvania were among those which advertised the film, one specifically focusing on the film having dealing with [...] "the labor question". A review in The Moving Picture News was contained detailed praise of the film's relevance and success in portraying the subject. The reviewer states, [...] "This film strikes home. ... The situation has been lived in New York City. The strike and its miseries are not forgotten. Whoever arranged the story had a big, tender heart and knew what appeals to the masses. The glee with which the superintendent's discomfiture was hailed by the audience spoke volumes. We wish {{some of the pictures}} were not quite so vividly black and white. Mayhap the tenseness of the situation hit the cameraman. Be that as it may, <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain</b> - there is no melodrama, but scenes out of real life." [...] While the reviewer in this case refers to the scenario being drawn from real life, the happy ending is termed as a fantasy by reviewer in The Moving Picture World who states, [...] " [...] of those pictures which thrill one despite their improbability. It may go in stories but never in fact, that an owner of a factory marries one of his girl employees, and a strike leader at that..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although no solid proof exists, rumors abound that Alamo Foods {{used the}} old brewery {{equipment}} {{for more than}} [...] "La Perla", and that, in fact, the brewery still bottled a tiny amount of the real Pearl and Texas Pride for close friends and sale on the black market. [...] <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> though: when the Blaine Act ended Prohibition at midnight on September 15, 1933, within minutes, 100 trucks and 25 railroad boxcars loaded with beer rolled out of the brewery grounds.|$|E

60|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain.</b> He {{could not}} give the {{required}} assurance to the detective. He must gain time.|$|R
60|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain.</b> Whatever {{happened}} I must {{regain the}} letter. Personally {{it was to}} me of greater importance than the exposure {{of what was going}} on aboard the schooner.|$|R
2500|$|If {{we could}} accept the {{somewhat}} obscure statement of Eusebius that Hegesippus [...] "made some quotations from the Gospel {{according to the}} Hebrews and from the Syriac Gospel," [...] {{we should have a}} reference to a Syriac New Testament as early as 160–180 AD, the time of that Hebrew Christian writer. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> the earliest New Testament of the Syriac church lacked not only the Antilegomena – 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude, and the Apocalypse – but the whole of the Catholic Epistles. These were at a later date translated and received into the Syriac Canon of the New Testament, as the quotations of the early Syrian Fathers take no notice of these New Testament writings.|$|E
2500|$|Daisy {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics, although fan reactions were more mixed. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 75, based on twelve reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Drew Beringer of AbsolutePunk commented [...] "Daisy is auditory proof, {{as this is}} the Long Island quintet’s most challenging and distinguished album yet", believing [...] "Some will love it, some will hate it, most will be perplexed by it and will need many listens to digest it. But <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> this is a record that will shake you". Dan Martin of NME described Daisy as a [...] "breathtakingly accomplished record" [...] calling the Brand New the [...] "most graceful rock band in America". Rock Sound also heaped praise upon the album, making comparisons to The Cure, The Smiths and Nirvana. Chris Hidden described the album as a more refined version of previous album, The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me, summarising that [...] "Brand New are now artistically unrivalled by their peers; it would be astonishing if they didn’t see where else they could go". Mikael Wood, journalist for Spin magazine particularly praised the moments of surprise throughout the album. [...] "Jesse Lacey howls about burning in bed and turning to dirt while his bandmates churn out noisy, jagged art-punk riffs that routinely explode without warning. The sound is old-fashioned, but the fury is fresh". Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone praised the band for not sticking to genre restraints; [...] "The quartet's fourth album avoids genre commonplaces with subtle shadings. 'You tried to put a fire out, but you used gasoline' — and songs like the heroin-jag slow-burner [...] "Bed" [...] prove that letting rip isn't always Lacey's best move." [...] Adam Downer of Sputnikmusic gave the album a 5/5, declaring [...] "Daisy is broken and Daisy is violent. It is not romantic {{and it is not}} particularly deep. It’s this writhing, bitter little record, obsessed with mortality as if the thing were breathing down its neck." ...|$|E

60|$|But <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain,</b> {{and that}} <b>was,</b> {{now that he}} had become {{involved}} with his new acquaintances to a <b>certain</b> extent, it <b>was</b> necessary for him to continue with them until he could leave without either compromising himself or injuring them.|$|R
60|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain.</b> Rowley, that morning, {{should not}} be {{entrusted}} with a razor and the handling of my chin. I sent {{him back to his}} bed, with orders not to rise from it without permission; and went about my toilette deliberately. In spite of the lad, I did not enjoy the prospect of Mrs. McRankine.|$|R
60|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain,</b> {{that the}} WHITE kitten had {{had nothing to}} do with it:--it was the black kitten's fault entirely. For the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it COULDN'T have had any hand in the mischief.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{depends on}} how they act. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> I {{am not going to}} stand for any more of their underhanded work," [...] {{answered}} Dave, grimly.|$|E
6000|$|... "They'll hustle him off pretty lively, that's sure. Well, <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> he won't bother {{this party}} any more," [...] added Dave. [...] "Let us get back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Home!" [...] cried Shep. [...] "Don't {{you dare}} to mention such a thing. No, I {{am not going}} home, boys. But <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> we can't stay at Lake Cameron." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were handed}} round for inspection. Rough and uncut as they stood, it was, of course, {{impossible}} to judge of their value. But <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain.</b> The men of science {{had been watching}} close at the first, and were sure Herr Schleiermacher had not put the stones in; they were keen at the withdrawal, and were equally sure he had taken them honestly out of the pannikins.|$|R
60|$|And {{the worst}} of it was that, as she well knew, sooner or later all this about Mr. Davies must come to the ears of her father, and then what would happen? <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain.</b> In his present poverty-stricken {{condition}} he would move heaven and earth to bring about her marriage to this rich man. Her father never had been very scrupulous where money was concerned, and the pinch of want was not likely to make him more so.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he went on}} to {{tell her}} all about it. Ida made no comment, that is after those first words, [...] "she did it on purpose," [...] which burst from her in astonishment. She felt, and he felt too, that the {{question}} as to how that gun went off was one which was best left uninquired into by them. No doubt if the man died there would be an inquest, and the whole matter would <b>be</b> investigated. Meanwhile <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain,</b> Edward Cossey, whom she was engaged to, was shot and likely to die.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> Wilcox; we {{must find}} out {{if any of them}} are still alive, and if so we must try and {{get them out of the}} Malays’ hands.” ...|$|E
6000|$|September 25th.--. [...] . <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain.</b> I cannot {{and will}} not spend the winter here. The time would be {{absolutely}} thrown away so far as regards any literary labor to be performed. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{may want}} {{to force him to}} sign some papers, or give up some papers he is holding, Sam. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> they were very anxious to see him-- these letters show that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a pity," [...] he said, [...] "that {{he changed}} his mind. For <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> very <b>certain.</b> The Duke and I are agreed upon it. A Brott {{ministry}} must never be formed." ...|$|R
6000|$|But let {{his heart}} be touched ever so much, <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain.</b> It {{could not be}} {{permitted}} that she should marry Adolphe. To that view of the matter he had given in his unrestricted adhesion; nor could he by any means withdraw it without losing altogether his position {{in the establishment of}} Madame Bauche. Nor indeed did his conscience tell him that such a marriage should be permitted. That would be too much. If every pretty girl were allowed to marry the first young man that might fall in love with her, what would the world come to? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain.</b> The family honour {{was in his}} hands. Anything {{that was}} to be done to keep Maud away from the {{intruder}} must be done by himself. Reggie was hopeless: he was capable, as far as Percy could see, of escorting Maud to the fellow's door in his own car and leaving her on the threshold with his blessing. As for Lord Marshmoreton, roses and the family history took up so much of his time that he could not be counted on for anything but moral support. He, Percy, must do the active work.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{right at}} all, Tom. But <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> the ring must be missing. I don't {{think that the}} teacher had {{anything}} to do with taking it. They don't have that sort here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stumped!" [...] muttered Joe. [...] "We {{might as}} well go back to the shelter and wait till he returns. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> he hasn't found any game, or we would have heard the firing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> Merwell {{will never}} get back to Oak Hall," [...] said Dave. [...] "He got his walking papers and that settled it. He is out for good, the same as Nick Jasniff." ...|$|E
60|$|C. Wal. Don't quote Scripture here, sir, {{especially}} in that gross literal way! The new lights here have {{taught us that}} Scripture's saying <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>is</b> a <b>certain</b> proof that it means another. Except, by the bye, in one text.|$|R
60|$|Some of them, who did {{not attempt}} peremptorily to choke the a {{processes}} made the startling discovery that they were not, after all, so shocked by his doctrines as they had at first supposed. The trouble was {{that they could not}} continue to listen to him, as formerly, with comfort.... <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain,</b> that they had never expected to look forward to a vestry meeting with such breathless interest and anxiety. This clergyman had suddenly accomplished the surprising feat of reviving the Church as a burning, vital factor {{in the life of the}} community! He had discerned her enemy, and defied his power....|$|R
6000|$|Pondering these questions, Percy {{decided on}} {{returning}} to his place by the Doctor's chair. [...] "Of <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I <b>am</b> <b>certain,</b> at any rate," [...] he thought to himself. [...] "I'll see the whole imposture out before I leave the house!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> I am {{much worse}} off now than I was {{when in the}} hands of Lew Flapp's crowd," [...] thought Dick dismally, after trying in vain to break the bonds that bound him.|$|E
6000|$|... "As to that, I can't say," [...] said Mrs. Hilary. [...] "You and {{he ought}} to know best. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain.</b> There won't be any {{opposition}} on his part or mine, my son, that you won't see yourself is reasonable--" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>certain,</b> {{precisely}} a week after, his Majesty,--much fluctuating in mind evidently, for the Document [...] "has {{been changed}} {{three or four}} times within forty-eight hours,"--presents his final answer to Hotham. Which runs to this effect ("outrageous," [...] as Hotham defines it):-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not sure," [...] I replied. [...] "I cannot say {{anything}} about that. But of <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I <b>am</b> <b>certain,</b> and that <b>is,</b> that if any germs of any kind entered my system, it is perfectly free from them now." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain,</b> she did {{not like}} to hear Agnes talk against the Lyddells. She could have done it herself; nay, she did so {{sometimes}} when with Lady Marchmont, but then that was only about [...] "nonsense." [...] She had lived with them too long, had shared in too many of their conversations and employments, was, in fact, too much one of the family, to like to hear them condemned. She thought it very strange, and she could not tell whether it was from having grown like them, or from a genuine dislike to injustice; at any rate it was this which convinced her that she had come to regard them in some degree as friends.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{she went}} on, more cheerfully, [...] "no one will venture {{to deny that}} Wenham is mad. He will be placed under restraint, of course, and the courts will make me an allowance. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{absolutely}} <b>certain,</b> and that <b>is</b> {{that he will not}} live a year." ...|$|R
