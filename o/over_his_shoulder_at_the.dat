25|$|The statue was rededicated on October 19, 2012 by General John Mulholland. At {{the time}} of the {{original}} battle he was Lieutenant general and Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Special Forces Command. He dedicated the statue in its new location in front of One World Trade Center across from Ground Zero and 9/11 Memorial. The bronze statue was positioned so the soldier atop the horse is keeping a watchful eye as he looks back <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> World Trade Center and its tenants. Soldiers representing the United States Army Special Operations Command attended the ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mechanic}} {{said he had}} {{remarked to}} Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant. Denver had asked how much fuel was shown. He told Denver there was [...] "less than half in the right tank and {{less than a quarter}} in the left tank". He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fuel gauges. The mirror was later recovered in the wreckage. Denver said he would use the autopilot inflight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve. He turned down an offer to refuel, saying he would be flying for about an hour.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this point}} Adorno {{reversed}} his earlier priorities: now his musical activities came {{second to the}} development of a philosophical theory of aesthetics. Thus, in the middle of 1929 he accepted Paul Tillich's offer to present an Habilitation on Kierkegaard, which Adorno eventually submitted under the title The Construction of the Aesthetic. At the time, Kierkegaard's philosophy exerted a strong influence, chiefly through its claim to pose an alternative to Idealism and Hegel's philosophy of history. Yet when Adorno turned his attention to Kierkegaard, watchwords like [...] "anxiety," [...] "inwardness" [...] and [...] "leap"—instructive for existentialist philosophy—were detached from their theological origins and posed, instead, as problems for aesthetics. As the work proceeded—and Kierkegaard's overcoming of Hegel's idealism was revealed to be a mere interiorization—Adorno excitedly remarked in a letter to Berg that he was writing without looking <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> faculty who would soon evaluate his work. Receiving favourable reports from Professors Tillich and Horkheimer, as well as Benjamin and Kracauer, the University conferred on Adorno the venia legendi in February 1931; on the very day his revised study was published, 23 March 1933, Hitler seized dictatorial powers.|$|E
