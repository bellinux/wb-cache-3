5|$|Savage {{followed}} {{his first book}} with Delilah of Harlem, The Mask of Venus, Our Mysterious Passenger and Other Stories and In the Shadow of the Pyramids. In addition to his fiction prose output, Savage published collections of his speeches and essays, and in 1895 wrote a book of poetry dedicated to his wife: After Many Years. Savage's writing style was fast and precise: he wrote from morning to night and rarely needed to correct his first drafts. He was able to carry <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> while writing. He joined the Author's Guild of America in 1894.|$|E

500|$|He {{noted that}} [...] "thinking" [...] is {{difficult}} to define and devised his famous Turing Test. If a machine could carry <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> (over a teleprinter) that was indistinguishable from {{a conversation with a}} human being, then it was reasonable to say that the machine was [...] "thinking". This simplified version of the problem allowed Turing to argue convincingly that a [...] "thinking machine" [...] was at least plausible and the paper answered all the most common objections to the proposition. The Turing Test was the first serious proposal in the philosophy of artificial intelligence.|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, Seth {{stated that}} his father fought in the Blackhawk War in Illinois in 1832. He also claimed {{that his father}} and Abraham Lincoln fought {{together}} in the war, became friends afterward, and that Seth met the future president during Lincoln's circuit-riding days in Illinois. [...] At {{about the same time}} the Kinmans acquired a rifle, known as [...] "Old Cotton Bale," [...] that Seth kept throughout his life. [...] The rifle had a [...] long barrel and [...] "is supposed to have killed Gen'l Peckenham" [...] at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. [...] With some skepticism, Anspach relates a long history of the rifle, gleaned from an 1864 local newspaper story on Kinman, of a renegade Kentucky sniper shooting the British general while carrying <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with American General Andrew Jackson.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} opening couch gag shows a pastiche of {{the cover}} collage from The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which was first used {{earlier in the season}} for [...] "Bart After Dark". Otherwise, the episode refers to other TV shows, including the syndicated couch gag featuring the Flintstone family, recycled from the season four episode [...] "Kamp Krusty", to mark The Simpsons surpassing The Flintstones as the longest-running animated series. Roy calls Homer and Marge Mr. and Mrs. S, which echoes Fonzie calling the Cunninghams [...] "Mr. and Mrs. C" [...] on Happy Days. Later, he decides to move in with [...] "two sexy ladies", recalling Jack Tripper in Three's Company. Homer hiding in the closet to hear what the network executives were planning to do with Poochie is a reference to Jay Leno reportedly eavesdropping <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> between NBC executives on whether he or David Letterman would replace Johnny Carson as the host of The Tonight Show.|$|E

500|$|Finding that {{he needed}} advice in regard to accouterments and the {{attitude}} of Australian soldiers, Jones made inquiries about consulting with an Australian. George Henry Goodall, a South Australian veteran of the Second Boer War, {{was at the time}} serving as Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant with the Australian Corps engaged in London at the coronation ceremonies for King Edward VII. Goodall was [...] "volunteered" [...] to attend Jones in order to model and to provide advice. Goodall later described how Jones had requested that he pose while the sculptor created a clay model of his head, but Simon Cameron observed that Jones's memoirs [...] "do not mention any sittings." [...] Nevertheless, a 1940 memorandum, based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with Goodall, noted that [...] "a comparison of a photograph of Mr Goodall, taken in 1902 with the statue itself certainly indicates a strong facial likeness". In the same memorandum it was noted that Goodall only posed for the head, and that he insisted that his selection to model for the statue was not based on any outstanding merit as a soldier.|$|E
500|$|The Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe speculated: [...] "I have {{sometimes}} wondered whether a brain like von Neumann's {{does not indicate}} a species superior to that of man". Eugene Wigner wrote that, seeing von Neumann's mind at work, [...] "one had {{the impression of a}} perfect instrument whose gears were machined to mesh accurately to a thousandth of an inch." [...] Paul Halmos states that [...] "von Neumann's speed was awe-inspiring." [...] Israel Halperin said: [...] "Keeping up with him was... impossible. The feeling was you were on a tricycle chasing a racing car." [...] Edward Teller admitted that he [...] "never could keep up with him". Teller also said [...] "von Neumann would carry <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with my 3-year-old son, {{and the two of them}} would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us." [...] When George Dantzig brought von Neumann an unsolved problem in linear programming [...] "as I would to an ordinary mortal", on which there had been no published literature, he was astonished when von Neumann said [...] "Oh, that!", before offhandedly giving a lecture of over an hour, explaining how to solve the problem using the hitherto unconceived theory of duality.|$|E
500|$|Actresses Anita Gillette, Jan Hooks, Patti LuPone, and Elaine Stritch reprised {{their roles}} as Margaret Lemon, Verna Maroney, Sylvia Rossitano, and Colleen Donaghy, respectively, the mothers of the {{characters}} Liz Lemon, Jenna Maroney, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), and Jack Donaghy, respectively. John Lutz appears {{as the mother of}} his character, TGS writer J.D. Lutz, but it is unclear whether this is portrayed as a casting joke on the part of 30 Rock or whether the character of Lutz is impersonating his own mother within the show. In addition, actress Novella Nelson guest starred as herself as Tracy Jordan's fake [...] "mother" [...] for the first time. Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin played himself in the episode as it is revealed that he was in a relationship with Liz's mother. In an interview with TV Guide in discussion of his guest spot, Aldrin said [...] "That was wonderful, carrying <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with very professional actors I greatly admired. I felt very honored to be paired up with something that also has another connection to me. [...] That was a lot of fun." [...] Aldrin revealed that when first notified about the guest appearance he had to [...] "think about it a little bit", and he mistook 30 Rock with the show 3rd Rock from the Sun, a program that previously aired on NBC.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Celia {{is based on}} Dorothy; Wainwright has noted that her mother [...] "became so passionate and emotional" [...] after falling in love again. Some scenes in the series are based on true events. In one episode Celia and Alan are shown laughing at an argument between Caroline and {{her husband in the}} next room; Wainwright recalls discovering her mother and stepfather in the same situation after Wainwright had had an argument with her husband Austin. Caroline's discomfort with Celia's discussing her sex life is based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> Wainwright had with her mother. Dorothy's husband died three years into their marriage, but according to Wainwright she was [...] "delighted" [...] to have their relationship dramatised; Wainwright believes Last Tango in Halifax is [...] "a celebration of how fantastic the whole thing was".|$|E

[...] The depth of the relationship between Hayasaka and Kurosawa is shown in that this film was based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> between the two friends. Hayasaka was very ill at the time, and pondering the fear of his own death. [...] Weak and sickly from TB, he told Kurosawa that “with this illness threatening my life, I can’t work.” Kurosawa was deeply affected by his friend’s death and “fell into a deep depression”.

2500|$|A simple example {{concerns}} the model on which aether was originally built: sound. The speed of propagation for mechanical waves, {{the speed of}} sound, {{is defined by the}} mechanical properties of the medium. Sound travels 4.3 times faster in water than in air. [...] This explains why a person hearing an explosion underwater and quickly surfacing can hear it again as the slower travelling sound arrives through the air. [...] Similarly, a traveller on an airliner can still carry <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with another traveller because the sound of words is travelling along with the air inside the aircraft. This effect is basic to all Newtonian dynamics, which says that everything from sound to the trajectory of a thrown baseball should all remain the same in the aircraft flying (at least at a constant speed) as if still sitting on the ground. This is the basis of the Galilean transformation, and the concept of frame of reference.|$|E

He is a sender, a person authorized to send spirits to the Farplane in the place of summoners, who once aspired to become a summoner himself before the Eternal Calm. He reveres Yuna and her legendary guardians and looks up to her. Unlike the outspoken Chuami, Kurgum is more introverted but determined. On orders from Baralai, Kurgum and Chuami travel to Besaid to meet with Yuna. Upon returning to Bevelle with Yuna and Wakka, they find out Sin has returned. As he and Chuami eavesdrop <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> between Yuna and Tidus, Kurgum suddenly claims to be in love with Yuna. It's implied that Kurgum is lying and has feelings for Chuami but she doesn't understand as Kurgum says it's something only summoners understand.

2500|$|Shortly after declaring war on Serbia, Conrad {{informed}} the Germans that Austria-Hungary could not start operations until 12 August, to much fury in Berlin. Bavarian diplomat Count Lerchenfeld reported to Munich: [...] "The Imperial government is thus {{put into the}} extraordinary difficult position of being exposed during the intervening period to the other Powers’ proposals for mediation and conferences, and if it continues to maintain its previous reserve towards such proposals, the odium of having provoked a world war will in the end recoil on it, even {{in the eyes of}} the German people. But a successful war on three fronts (viz, in Serbia, Russia and France) can not be initiated and carried on such a basis. It is imperative that the responsibility for any extension of the conflict to the Powers not directly concerned should under all circumstances fall on Russia alone." [...] At the same time, the German Ambassador to Russia, Portalés, reported that, based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with Sazonov, Russia was prepared to make [...] "astonishing" [...] concessions by promising to pressure Serbia to agree to most of the Austrian demands to avoid a war. The prospect of talks was rejected out of hand by Bethmann Hollweg.|$|E
2500|$|... is the 17-year-old female protagonist and {{narrator of}} the audio drama Final Fantasy X -Will-. She {{is a member}} of the Spira Council and the {{assistant}} of her childhood friend , but owing to her force of character and Kurgum's lack thereof, the de facto roles are actually the reverse. The two are sent from Bevelle to Besaid by Baralai to meet with Yuna. As Chuami is headstrong and tactless, she constantly upsets people with her brutal honesty. She has a deep hatred for the Yevoners organization for its role in her mother's death at the hands of Yevoner hunters since her mother only sympathized with the group. When Yuna is reluctant to accompany her and Kurgum back to Bevelle, Chuami spurs Yuna into action by mentioning Tidus' weakened state when they met. Based on stories from her mother, Chuami claims to be Auron's daughter, although Lulu says there are no physical similarities between the two and believes that Auron would have mentioned having children. Upon returning to Bevelle with Yuna and Wakka, they learn Sin has returned, possibly beckoned by someone's wish. While eavesdropping <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> between Tidus and Yuna, Kurgum says he is in love with Yuna but Chuami doesn't understand what he truly means. The two part ways with Chuami returning to Besaid with Tidus while Kurgum stays with Yuna and Wakka in Bevelle. After Tidus realizes Yuna's true reason for breaking up with him, Chuami accompanies him and Lulu on a journey to reunite with Yuna's group.|$|E
