60|$|There {{were two}} ways to reach the cover where the company of Ghoorkhas had been lying, for three hours. The top ridge had been proved to be {{absolutely}} a death passage, {{but there was another}} path, by which General Westmacott had forced his way up, three days before, and which was shorter across the <b>open</b> <b>zone</b> of fire. A fresh regiment was to take the lead.|$|E
60|$|But {{the task}} was as severe a one as the most {{fighting}} General could ask for. On the southern side the banks formed a long slope which could be shaved as with a razor by the rifle fire of the enemy. How to advance across that broad <b>open</b> <b>zone</b> was indeed a problem. It {{was one of many}} occasions in this war in which one wondered why, if a bullet-proof shield capable of sheltering a lying man could be constructed, a trial should not be given to it. Alternate rushes of companies with a safe rest after each rush would save the troops from the continued tension of that deadly never ending fire. However, it is idle to discuss what might have been done to mitigate their trials. The open ground had to be passed, and then they came to--not the enemy, but a broad and deep river, with a single bridge, probably undermined, and a single ford, which was found not to exist in practice. Beyond the river was tier after tier of hills, crowned with stone walls and seamed with trenches, defended by thousands of the best marksmen in the world, supported by an admirable artillery. If, in spite of the advance over the open and in spite of the passage of the river, a ridge could still be carried, it was only to be commanded by the next; and so, one behind the other, like the billows of the ocean, a series of hills and hollows rolled northwards to Ladysmith. All attacks must be in the open. All defence was from under cover. Add to this, that the young and energetic Louis Botha was in command of the Boers. It was a desperate task, and yet honour forbade that the garrison should be left to its fate. The venture must be made.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn concrete, a crack {{reveals a}} {{morphology}} comprised of an external part with a surface opening, and a completely or partially closed part {{below the surface}} with potentially partially <b>opened</b> <b>zone.</b> Conventional ultrasound methods defined by ASTM or ISO normalization are founded on low frequency waves time of flight measurement.

At higher frequencies, strong multiple scattering phenomena occur due to the presence of aggregates, making impossible standard waveform analysis. The main issue {{of this paper is to}} use higher frequencies and to take advantage of multiple scattering by the study diffuse waves transport and its interaction with partial contacts along the crack. The ability of diffuse ultrasound to characterize the <b>opened</b> <b>zone</b> of the crack is shown. However, the closed part of the crack remains imperceptible. To overcome this difficulty, a low frequency dynamic loading is superimposed to diffuse waves in order to alternatively open and close portions the crack.

40|$|Aluminum foams are {{favorable}} {{in modern}} thermal engineering applications {{because of the}} high thermal conductivity and the large specific surface area. The present study aims to investigate an application of porous aluminum foam by using the local thermal equilibrium (LTE) and local thermal nonequilibrium (LTNE) heat transfer models. Three-dimensional simulations of laminar flow (porous foam zone), turbulent flow (<b>open</b> <b>zone),</b> and heat transfer are performed by a computational fluid dynamics approach. In addition, the Forchheimer extended Darcy's law is employed to evaluate the fluid characteristics. By comparing and analyzing the average and local Nusselt numbers, it is found that the LTNE and LTE models can reach the same Nusselt numbers inside the aluminum foam when the air velocity is high, meaning that the aluminum foam is in a thermal equilibrium state. Besides, a high interfacial heat transfer coefficient is required for the aluminum foam to reach a thermal equilibrium state as the height of the aluminum foam is reduced. This study suggests that the LTE model can be applied to predict the thermal performance at high fluid velocities or for the case with a large height...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{a gasket}} made in soft {{material}} is not recommended for large size centrifugal compressor case flange. The two case halves are assembled with bolted flanges and leakage is prevented by the metal–to–metal contact under pressure.

In the paper an original model able to predict the leakage condition, based on a Fracture Mechanics approach, is presented. The flange surfaces interface {{is regarded as a}} crack which can be partially open. As the flanges can not transfer tensile traction, the extension of the <b>open</b> <b>zone,</b> i. e. the crack length, is obtained by the condition that the Stress Intensity Factor K is zero. An analytical model, based on the Weight Function technique, was applied to find the stress intensity K, and then to predict the leakage condition. The paper illustrates a validation of the proposed model by the comparison with a nonlinear Finite Element analysis and the results of a full scale experimental test series obtained by a research collaboration between industry and academia. The leakage pressure predicted by the model is in good agreement with the numerical prediction and the experimental results...|$|E

However, the difference between the sub-canopy and the open grassland was not significant during the wet season, implying that the role of a tree canopy in enhancing grass biomass is greater during the dry than the wet season. Variations in percent grass species composition from the mid-canopy to the adjacent open grassland were observed, indicating that while B. glabra canopy cover favours certain grass species, other species find the microclimatic conditions under the canopy unfavourable. Soil organic matter in the mid-canopy zone was significantly higher than in the sub-canopy and adjacent <b>open</b> <b>zones</b> during both dry and wet season. Although the sub-canopy zone exhibited significantly higher soil moisture content than the mid-canopy and <b>open</b> grassland <b>zones</b> during the dry season, the difference between the subcanopy and the adjacent open grassland during the wet season was not significant, suggesting that the tree canopy influence on soil moisture is more pronounced in the dry than the wet season...|$|R
40|$|I survey recent {{successes in}} the {{application}} of relativistic MHD and force-free electrodynamics to the modeling of the pulsars' rotational energy loss mechanism {{as well as to the}} structure and emission characteristics of Pulsar Wind Nebulae. I suggest that unsteady reconnection in the current sheet separating the closed from the <b>open</b> <b>zones</b> of the magnetosphere is responsible for the torque fluctuations observed in some pulsars, as well as for departures of the braking index from the canonical value of 3. I emphasize the significance of the boundary layer between the closed and <b>open</b> <b>zones</b> as the active site in the outer magnetopshere. I elaborate on the conflict between the models currently in use to interpret the gamma ray and X-ray pulses from these systems with the electric current flows found in the spin down models. Because the polar cap ``gap'' is the essential component in the supply of plasma to pulsar magnetospheres and to pulsar wind nebulae, I emphasize the importance of high sensitivity gamma ray observations of pulsars with core components of radio emission and high magnetospheric voltage, since these observations will look directly into the polar plasma production region. I also discuss the shock conversion of flow energy into the spectra of the synchrotron emitting particles in the Nebulae. I comment on the prospects for future developments and improvements in all these areas. Comment: 55 pages, 21 figures.

Tide speed and wind direction limited the effectiveness of baited drift lines. Catch rates in the fish traps were so low that only overall fish captured (total fish), pikey bream, Acanthopagrus berda, and mud crabs, Scylla serrata, were sufficiently abundant for analysis of abundance. Of those taxa, only male S. serrata in the Daintree River and female S. serrata in the Moresby River showed any significant differences between zones. In both cases relative abundance was higher in the <b>open</b> <b>zone.</b> Those differences were not found in crab pot samples where male S. serrata in the Moresby River were significantly more abundant in the NTR. In terms of length frequency, greater proportions of larger A. berda and male S. serrata were captured in the Moresby NTR than outside. All non-significant results exhibited low power due to high variability and low catch rates.

40|$|The Jáchal River Valley {{displays}} {{a number of}} significant Holocene sedimentary accumulations made up of fine-grained materials. These deposits are interpreted as the sedimentary infill of shallow temporary lakes that were generated by slow growing episodes of alluvial fans that obstructed the Jáchal River Valley. The association of fossil remains through the Holocene sedimentary sequence suggests that the accumulation of lacustrine sediments was affected by climate variations. The predominant aridity was punctuated by very few humid episodes characterised by fresh-water gastropoda and the intercalations of muddy sediments. The high proportion of charcoal particles in some samples indicates periodic forest fires. Abundant non-pollen forest remains suggest that an <b>open</b> <b>zone</b> dominated by several types of grasses underwent a dry season during part of the year. The palynomorph associations found in the Jáchal River Valley Holocene lacustrine sediments suggest that the humid conditions were less intense than those in the San Juan River Valley located more than one hundred kilometres southwards.
