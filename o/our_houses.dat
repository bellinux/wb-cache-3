Our men fashioned the wood into pipe stems, emergency snowshoes, snares, wooden nails, whistles for the children, beading looms, and frames for stretching hides. Rotted willow wood {{was used to}} smoke hides. Green willow branches were burned to smoke meat. We twisted the inner bark fibers into temporary rope, twine and fish nets. We weather proofed rawhide by wrapping it in willow bark. We used willow branches as lathing for <b>our</b> <b>houses.</b> Our men scraped off the inner cambium layer and added other ingredients, such as bearberry, to make a smoking mixture, ‘Kinnikinick’. We repaired our carts, made a shelter when we were caught in a storm, burned for fuel and had {{a variety of other}} practical uses for the wood of the willow.|$|E

The duties included [...] "drawing pictures of our [...] person or of our successors or others of our royal family for the decorment of <b>our</b> <b>houses</b> and palaces". However, from 1723 to 1823 the office was a sinecure held by members of the Abercrombie family, not necessarily connected with artistic ability.|$|E

500|$|The Union of Crowns in 1603 {{removed a}} major source of artistic {{patronage}} in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London. The result has been seen as a shift [...] "from crown to castle", as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who {{became one of the most}} successful portrait painters of the reign of Charles I and trained the Baroque artist John Michael Wright (1617–94). The growing importance of royal art can be seen in the post created in 1702 for George Ogilvie. The duties included [...] "drawing pictures of our [...] person or of our successors or others of our royal family for the decorment of <b>our</b> <b>houses</b> and palaces".

[...] The Seneca [...] "declared they would no more be falsely accused, or fight the Enemy twice" [...] (the latter being an indication that they would refuse quarter in the future). [...] Butler reported that [...] "notwithstanding my utmost Precaution and Endeavours to save the Women and Children, I could not prevent some of them falling unhappy Victims to the Fury of the Savages," [...] but also that {{he spent most of}} his time guarding the fort during the raid. [...] Quebec's Governor Frederick Haldimand was so upset at Butler's inability to control his forces that he refused to see him, writing [...] "such indiscriminate vengeance taken even upon the treacherous and cruel enemy they are engaged against is useless and disreputable to themselves, as it is contrary to the dispositions and maxims of the King whose cause they are fighting." [...] Butler continued to insist in later writings that he was not at fault for the events of the day.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{of their}} noxious emissions, Leblanc soda works became targets of {{lawsuits}} and legislation. [...] An 1839 suit against soda works alleged, [...] "the gas from these manufactories is {{of such a}} deleterious nature as to blight everything within its influence, and is alike baneful to health and property. The herbage of the fields in their vicinity is scorched, the gardens neither yield fruit nor vegetables; many flourishing trees have lately become rotten naked sticks. Cattle and poultry droop and pine away. It tarnishes the furniture in <b>our</b> <b>houses,</b> and when we are exposed to it, which is of frequent occurrence, we are afflicted with coughs and pains in the head ... all of which we attribute to the Alkali works." ...|$|E

John Smith, though he had not been in Virginia since 1609 and was not a firsthand eyewitness, related in his History of Virginia that braves of the Powhatan [...] "came unarmed into <b>our</b> <b>houses</b> with deer, turkeys, fish, fruits, and other {{provisions}} to sell us". The Powhatan grabbed any tools or weapons available and killed all English settlers they found, including men, women, and children of all ages. [...] Chief Opechancanough led a coordinated series of surprise attacks by the Powhatan Confederacy that killed 347 people, a quarter of the English population of the Virginia colony.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Las Abejas" [...] (Spanish for [...] "the bees") was chosen, {{according}} to {{one member of the}} organization, because [...] "like the bees we want to build <b>our</b> <b>houses</b> together, to collectively work and enjoy the fruit of our work. [...] We want to produce 'honey' but also to share with anyone who needs it... We know that, like the little bees, the work is slow but the result is sure because it is collective." [...] Another member of the organization notes a political element in the choice of the name: [...] "The bee is a very small insect that is able to move a sleeping cow when it pricks. [...] Our struggle is like a bee that pricks, that is our resistance, but it's non-violent." ...|$|E

2500|$|An anti-war protest {{took place}} in Donetsk city on 15 June. The protest, {{the first of its}} kind in pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory, called for an end to the {{fighting}} in Donbass. About 500 people, who had gathered outside the RSA building, shouted, [...] "Stop the war!", [...] "Give us back <b>our</b> <b>houses,</b> our homes are broken!", and [...] "Get out of here!" [...] Specifically, protesters demanded that the separatists cease firing rocket attacks from residential areas on the outskirts of Donetsk. Whilst all parties to the conflict continued to support implementation of the measures specified by Minsk II, minor skirmishes continued on a daily basis through June and July 2015. Ukrainian troops suffered losses on a daily basis, and the ceasefire was labelled [...] "unworkable" [...] and [...] "impossible to implement". Despite constant fighting and shelling along the line of contact, no territorial changes occurred. This state of stalemate led the war to be labelled a [...] "frozen conflict".|$|E
2500|$|These {{differences}} were perceived by Mazakmat who returned home and promulgated the religion despite {{resistance from the}} Catholic and Methodist missions. He met up with an old friend, Michael Homerang, who was a highly respected malanggan carver and clan leader (maimai) {{in the village of}} Madina, on the north shore of New Ireland Province in the far north east. Momerang later said [...] "I saw a white man and woman come to my village and sit down to eat and talk with us. They even slept in <b>our</b> <b>houses.</b> … Only the Almight can make this happen…" [...] Then they met with clan leaders and elders of the community and early in 1958 there were a further 10 conversions who elected the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Papua New Guinea, followed by 30-40 more converts {{over the next four years}} in two villages. 1958 is considered the founding year of the Bahá'í community in Papua New Guinea. Representatives from Papua and New Guinea each (the country was then administered separately) [...] attended the 1958 conference in Australia on the promulgation of the religion.|$|E

[...] "What?" [...] said the messenger, whose name was Jacob Hawn, the owner of mill, [...] "leave the mill and let it be burnt down? We think we can maintain it." [...] "If you maintain it" [...] said Joseph, [...] "you will do well do as you please." [...] The messenger returned and said if we thought we could maintain the mill it was Joseph’s council for us to do it, if we thought not, to come to Far West and we thought from the way the thing was represented it would be like cowards to leave and not try to maintain it, and as they agreed to be at peace we thought to gather up <b>our</b> <b>houses</b> would be useless, for we did not know that it was Joseph’s decided council for us to do so [...] [...] [...]” ...|$|E

2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} the High Priest said a short {{prayer in the}} outer area. The Jerusalem Talmud taught {{that this was the}} prayer of the High Priest on the Day of Atonement, when he left the Holy Place whole and in one piece: “May it be {{pleasing}} before you, Lord, our God of our fathers, that a decree of exile not be issued against us, not this day or this year, but if a decree of exile should be issued against us, then let it be exile to a place of Torah. [...] May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that a decree of want not be issued against us, not this day or this year, but if a decree of want should be issued against us, then let it be a want because of the performance of religious duties. [...] May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that this year be a year of cheap food, full bellies, good business; a year in which the earth forms clods, then is parched so as to form scabs, and then moistened with dew, so that your people, Israel, will not be in need of the help of one another. [...] And do not heed the prayer of travelers that it not rain.” The Rabbis of Caesarea added, “And concerning your people, Israel, that they not exercise dominion over one another.” And for {{the people who live in}} the Sharon plain he would say this prayer, “May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that <b>our</b> <b>houses</b> not turn into our graves.”.|$|E
