5|$|An {{example of}} {{gravitational}} lensing {{is found in}} the radio galaxy 3C 324. First thought to be a single overluminous radio galaxy with a redshift of z=1.206, it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies, with the radio galaxy at the aforementioned redshift being lensed by another galaxy at redshift z=0.845. The first example of a multiply-imaged radio galaxy discovered, the source appears to be an elliptical galaxy with a dust lane obscuring <b>our</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus. In even shorter wavelengths, the BL Lac object PG 1553+113 is a heavy emitter of gamma rays. This object is the most distant found to emit photons with energies in the TeV range as of 2007. The spectrum is unique, with hard emission in some ranges of the gamma-ray spectrum in stark contrast to soft emission in others.|$|E

For example, some regions of the Galactic Center have more than 30 magnitudes of extinction in the optical, meaning that less than 1 optical photon in 1012 passes through. This results in the so-called zone of avoidance, where <b>our</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extra-galactic sky is severely hampered, and background galaxies, such as Dwingeloo 1, were only discovered recently through observations in radio and infrared.|$|E

500|$|For {{much of its}} history, the Assemblies of God officially opposed Christian {{participation}} in war and was listed by The Pacifist Handbook as America's third largest peace church in 1940. The official position of the church until 1967 encouraged Christian nonviolence: [...] "We [...] [...] [...] are nevertheless constrained to declare we cannot conscientiously participate in war and armed resistance which involves the actual destruction of human life, since this is contrary to <b>our</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clear teachings of the inspired Word of God". Most of the founders and first generation members of the denomination held to this view, and it was presented as official teaching throughout World War I and World War II. The official pacifist position remained unchanged until 1967 when the denomination affirmed [...] "the right of each member to choose whether to declare their position as a combatant, a noncombatant, or a conscientious objector". This {{was the culmination of}} a process begun during World War I, when it was unpopular to hold antiwar views, in which AG adherents questioned their denomination's pacifist stance.|$|E

2500|$|The American scholar Susan Morgan called Mansfield Park {{the most}} {{difficult}} of all Austen’s novels as it features the weakest of all of Austen’s heroines who ends up the most beloved member of the Bertram family. Morgan argued that to understand the novel properly requires understanding of the capacity for characters to change or not to change. Mary Crawford, while possessing some good qualities and having much charm and vivacity is ultimately doomed by her superficiality, materialism and an inability to change. A telling example of Mary’s character occurs when says [...] "Look, where I will, I see that it is so; and I feel that it must be", as she assumes that what she sees before her is all that will ever be, and the possibility of anything else existing does not occur to her. Through not devoid of kindness, Mary has a strong competitive streak that leads her to see love as a game where one party conquers and controls the other, which coupled with her cynicism and narcissism makes her insensitive towards the feelings of others, as she insists that Edmund abandons his clerical career merely it is not prestigious enough for her and her inability to appreciate improvements, as she likes things whole and lacks the discernment to value change in one's moral character and the hard work necessary to bring it about. Price by contrast is unique amongst the Austen heroines in that her story begins when she is 10 and traces her story up to the age 17. When Price is sent to Mansfield Park, her tears at leaving the only home she has ever known, shows her awareness of the past, of who she is and was, and her wish to maintain her identity. Morgan wrote though Price is a flawed heroine, she possesses [...] "…the energy, open to us all, to struggle against selfishness, toward self-knowledge, and that generosity of mind which should illuminate <b>our</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people around us.". Austen also suggests change can be either for the worse or the better as Price almost succumbs to Henry Crawford’s charm and apparent reformation of character, even though she knows deep down that he is by nature malleable and undependable because he does not feel very much, and therefore whatever his passions are now will be easily replaced. Morgan argued that Price’s principle virtue is that of" [...] growing worth", her ability to understand the world around her, to use her reason, to care about others, to change yet remain true to herself.|$|E
