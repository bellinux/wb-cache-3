25|$|Going back {{to those}} studio days for me and John Paul Jones, the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> didn't do was speed up, because if you sped up you wouldn't be seen again. Everything had to be right on the meter all the way through. And I really wanted to write {{something}} which did speed up, and took the emotion and the adrenaline with it, and would reach a sort of crescendo. And that {{was the idea of}} it. That's why it was a bit tricky to get together in stages.|$|E

500|$|Many other {{scenes in}} Homicide were filmed {{primarily}} in the Fells Point neighorhood, including actual streets, bars and houses to create authenticity. Scenes at the Homicide morgue were filmed inside Baltimore's actual Office of the Medical Examiner, which the actors hated performing in due to the unsettling atmosphere; Ned Beatty said of filming there, [...] "The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> can't get on camera is, oh boy, it smells." [...] Homicide footage was transferred from film to videotape for editing at the Maryland studio Colorlab Motion Picture Services. There, Levinson and Ewing worked with colorist Drexel Williams to drain the footage of color value, leaving a gritty visual style almost reminiscent of black-and-white. This technique was downplayed starting in the second season, giving the show a more colorful look.|$|E

500|$|Although {{he was a}} striker, Dickov {{was better}} known for his {{tenacity}} than his goal-scoring exploits. In a 2003 interview with the Independent on Sunday he provided a summary of his playing style: [...] "The ability to battle {{is one of the}} main parts of my game. I know my limits. I am not the sort who gets the ball and is then going to beat five or six players and stick it in the top corner from God knows where. But, whether I'm playing well or not, the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> will get from me is 110 per cent, upsetting defenders and basically giving them pain." [...] Rio Ferdinand was mentioning his name as the biggest headache to deal with on the pitch. His combative approach resulted in Manchester City manager Joe Royle naming him [...] "The Wasp", and during his time at Leicester he was known as [...] "The Pest".|$|E
500|$|Nix {{praised the}} game's sound design, {{describing}} it as [...] "far and away above {{what would be}} expected on the Game Boy Color." [...] He noted, for example, that [...] "there are individual sounds of the lightsaber swinging back and forth — cutting left will sound differently than the backswing or upswing of the third stroke against an enemy." [...] Samantha Craggs of The Electric Playground praised Obi-Wan's Adventures for its interesting gameplay {{and the use of}} the lightsaber. She commented: [...] "There are quite a few things to like about this game. For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>you</b> can't underestimate the feeling of moving across the floor wielding a deadly lightsaber. Also, the levels are interesting. [...] In , Obi-Wan is actually in a boat, going through the Naboo swamp, while battle droids shoot at him from the banks. While you're essentially fighting the same enemies in the same manner, there are enough twists in the level designs to interest you in continuing." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics, ranging from largely positive to negative. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an A–, calling it [...] "gorgeously shot", citing the [...] "lush, smoky gaming sequences" [...] in particular. Television Without Pity ranked [...] "Hell Money" [...] the eleventh most nightmare-inducing {{episode of the}} show noting, [...] "If there’s <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> don’t want to mess with, it’s the Chinese mafia. Especially the branch that dresses up like Slipknot and either a) burns you alive, if you’re lucky, or b) forces you {{to participate in a}} haunted organ-harvesting raffle only to slowly carve you up and sell your vital organs on the black market, {{whether you like it or}} not." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, and called it a [...] "hard episode to love [...] sincere and purposeful". The two praised the conceit of the episode, arguing that by presenting the situation from the Chinese immigrants—members of an alien culture—and Chao's point of view, [...] "Mulder and Scully seem clumsy and arrogant. And by implication, the audience are made to feel just as arrogant." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{over the course}} of seven days in Baltimore. The scene in which Pembleton and Felton try to find the correct police car in a large garage was filmed in a rundown early 20th-century ballroom. The scene {{features}} dozens of white unmarked Cavaliers. Shortly before [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] was filmed, the Baltimore Police Department stopped using Cavaliers as their regular brand of police car, and agreed to sell their collection of leftover Cavaliers to the Homicide show for $1. Although the cars were used as props in the episode, only two of the cars were actually drivable. The scenes set in the medical examiner's office were filmed in the actual Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore. The actors, particularly Jon Polito, hated performing in the morgue because they found the atmosphere unsettling. Ned Beatty said of filming there, [...] "The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> can't get on camera is, oh boy, it smells." [...] The identification pictures of suspects that Munch looks through were all pictures of photos of members of the Homicide crew. One of the final scenes in the episode, featuring Polito, Johnson and Belzer speaking in an alley at night, was conceived, written and shot in one night simply because it was raining outside, and the Homicide crew wanted {{to take advantage of the}} location during a rainy night.|$|E
500|$|The stage play Being Sellers premiered in Australia in 1998, {{three years}} after the release of the {{biography}} by Roger Lewis, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers. [...] In 2004, the book was turned into an HBO film with the same title, starring Geoffrey Rush. The play later transferred to New York in December 2010. The Belfast Telegraph notes how the film captured Sellers's [...] "life of drugs, drink, fast cars and lots and lots of beautiful women". Although the film was widely praised by critics, both Lord Snowdon and Britt Ekland were highly critical of the film and the enactment of Sellers; Ekland believed that the film left the audiences with the wrong idea of her former husband, saying [...] "the film leaves you with the impression that Peter Sellers was essentially a likeable man when in reality he was a monster. He may have been a brilliant actor, but as a human being he had no saving graces at all". Snowdon disagreed with Ekland's verdict, and with the film, and stated that Sellers [...] "had a light touch, a sense of humour, I can't bear to see him portrayed as somebody who was apparently without either... The man on the screen is charmless, humourless and boring—the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> could never say about Peter." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Master Plan" [...] was {{directed}} by Dean Holland, his third directorial credit after [...] "Greg Pikitis" [...] and [...] "Sweetums". The script read-through and filming took place in March 2010. Rob Lowe's first day of filming took place on his birthday, March 17, which was {{the same day the}} scene where he kissed Rashida Jones was shot. The original cut of [...] "The Master Plan" [...] was a full 30 minutes and had to be cut down to 22 minutes for broadcast. The staff of Parks and Recreation had difficulty editing the episode down because the script involved so many interconnected subplots between the characters. Screenwriter Harris Wittels said, [...] "As soon as you'd cut <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>you</b> had to cut something else because it was tied to another piece." [...] Among the scenes cut were an extended cold open in which Ron gives April a handgun for her 21st birthday, much to the chagrin of Leslie. Also cut was a scene in which Ron chastises Leslie for yelling at Ben at the Snakehole Lounge and orders her to apologize to him so she will not be fired. Instead, the episode was changed to reflect that Leslie decided to apologize to Ben herself, with the line from Leslie [...] "I have to go swallow my pride" [...] added just before she spoke to Ben.|$|E

500|$|In November 2009, in an {{interview}} with MTV News, Canadian rapper Drake praised Rihanna's then-upcoming fourth studio album, Rated R (2009). During the same interview, he revealed that they have collaborated on a track that didn't make the final cut on the album, [...] "the record we have is great. It's a special record, so for it not to make it, I know something had to click. It's all good. I think the project's gonna be great no matter what." [...] Talking for the same publication, Tor Erik Hermansen of Norwegian production duo StarGate recalled that during an event Rihanna met with Drake backstage and asked him to record a verse on her song, [...] "She's calling me up saying, 'Where are the files?' That's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> don't hear often from artists on her level." [...] "What's My Name?" [...] was written by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Hermansen, Ester Dean, Traci Hale and Drake, while the production was done by StarGate. In {{an interview}} for HitQuarters, Hale explained that she got into the project that's to a phone call she received from Dean. She also elaborated that her work on the song was mostly lyrical, while Dean and StarGate did most of the music. When asked what's the inspiration behind the song she stated, [...] "Oh love, love, love! And it’s sexy – it started as a real sexy track and then you put something sexy over it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jewish philanthropist Baron Eric de Rothschild {{suggests}} that the extent of antisemitism in France has been exaggerated. In an interview with The Jerusalem Post he says that [...] "the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> can't say is that France is an anti-Semitic country." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2010, {{video footage}} of Steele was {{released}} in which he stated that the Afghan war was [...] "a war of Obama's choosing. If he's such a student of history has he not understood that, you know, that's the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> don't do - is engage in a land war in Afghanistan? Everyone who has tried, over a thousand years of history has failed." [...] He also said the war was [...] "not something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in." [...] In fact, War in Afghanistan was initiated by George W. Bush in October 2001 {{in retaliation for the}} September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington D.C.; Barack Obama has increased troop levels there since taking office.|$|E
60|$|There is but <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> which <b>you</b> {{have to fear}} {{in earth}} or heaven--being untrue to your better selves, and {{therefore}} untrue to God. If you will not do the <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> know to be right, and say the <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> know to be true, then indeed you are weak. You are a coward; you desert God.|$|R
60|$|Now why is this? Simply {{because in}} laying <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> on another <b>you</b> only move weight. In {{thrusting}} <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> under another, <b>you</b> {{have not only}} to move weight, but to overcome friction. That is why you do it, though you are hardly aware of it: simply because so you employ less force, and take less trouble.|$|R

2500|$|In 2008, Blasko co-composed the score, with Stefan Gregory (sound designer), for Bell Shakespeare's {{production}} of Hamlet, which ran from June to August. Diana Simmonds of Stage Noise was disappointed by {{an aspect of}} the opening night [...] "ess successful on opening night at least were the songs which open and then punctuate the action, composed and performed by [...] Her face mike and/or the sound balance muddied the lyrics and the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> need in Shakespeare is to hear the words". Whereas Helen Barry of Australian Stage felt Blasko was [...] "truly sublime ... er musical accompaniments add a layer of melancholy rapture to the performance which {{goes to the heart of}} Hamlet's grief, anger and loss. Ingeniously, Blasko is incorporated into the production itself as one of the players, which creates a seamless quality to her musical interludes".|$|E
2500|$|... "Daddy" [...] is {{the second}} single {{released}} from the album. It was the first song that she and Naughty Boy had worked together on and she {{pointed out that the}} song {{has nothing to do with}} her father. It has the sound of an early 1990s dance hit, and the song has been compared to the music by Seal and Adamski. The track is about her struggle while trying to get into the music industry and how people can get fanatical about money, drugs, fame or religion. [...] "Daddy" [...] also represents how that <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> can keep returning to, like how drug addiction in the music industry and how easy it is to turn to. However, at the same time as she wrote the song she was thinking about The Jeremy Kyle Show, and the fact that people laugh at the people on that show, and that they are desperate enough to go on the show and talk about their problems. She also said that the song was written very quickly in two or three hours.|$|E
2500|$|Jane Rackham {{from the}} Radio Times wrote [...] "It seems Toadie's fears that his wedding to Sonya is jinxed are {{justified}} as his big day ends in tragedy in this dramatic episode." [...] The Daily Mail's Jaci Stephen stated [...] "When Sonya tells Toadie that the wedding will all go smoothly, {{you just know}} that there is disaster in store – and, sure enough, when a gas canister is knocked over, there's a huge explosion that results in the death of two key characters." [...] A Daily Post reporter quipped [...] "No wedding goes without a hitch in soapland, and Toadie and Sonya's is no exception." [...] On the day the episode was broadcast in the UK, All About Soaps Claire Crick wrote [...] "There's just <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> need to have {{at the top of your}} to-do list today… and that's watch Neighbours! The day of the explosion has finally arrived and the episode will be epic from start to finish – we promise!" [...] Digital Spy ran a poll asking readers whether Channel 5 should put Neighbours in the prime time slot again and 89.12% believed that it would be a good idea.|$|E
