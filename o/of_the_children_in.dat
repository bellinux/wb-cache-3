5|$|David Darts {{discussed}} Not in Front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Children</b> <b>in</b> {{an article}} for Studies in Art Education, and wrote that queries over artistic value as balanced against a desire to protect attendees of educational institutions from perceived harm repeatedly came up over {{time in the history}} of censorship. He observed that the rationale for justifying censorship of artwork from children was based upon similar reasons dating back from Plato to contemporary times, namely anxiety that youth would become corrupted by viewing products deemed inappropriate.|$|E
5|$|Presumption {{in favor}} of joint custody: In some states joint {{physical}} custody is chosen over other arrangements unless the court finds that joint custody {{would not be in}} the best interest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> <b>In</b> other words it is the preferred arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{discussed}} Not in Front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Children</b> <b>in</b> academic journal articles, and characterized it {{as a work}} which balances education policy against {{the negative consequences of}} censorship. In an article for Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, Middlebury College women's studies professor Deborah Grant compared the book to Harmful to Minors by Judith Levine. Grant characterized both books as significant works emphasizing the importance of allowing youths access to informative educational resources. She classed Heins' monograph as a thorough and important survey of the chronology of censorship. Perry L. Glanzer wrote in English Journal that Heins had a valid viewpoint to engage students on controversial topics in literature classes, and he added it was necessary to teach them all perspectives of a debate. Ellen P. Goodman wrote for Berkeley Technology Law Journal that Heins was critical of prior articles which attempted to show negative impact from violence as portrayed on television programs.|$|E

5|$|Southwark Crown Court found Harris {{guilty of}} all twelve counts of indecent assault. During the trial, it was learned that, while making Kids Can Say No!, Harris was {{involved}} in a casual sexual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend; the relationship began when the victim was 13 years old and lasted for 15 years. Harris had committed nine of the twelve counts by the film's release, including the assault of fifteen-year-old Tonya Lee in London three months before the release. The first victim was about the age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> Kids Can Say No! The last assault of which Harris was convicted occurred several weeks after his meeting with officials in Western Australia to propose another film about child sexual abuse. A former child actor from the Barbara Speake Stage School who appeared in Kids Can Say No! said that Harris' behavior with older girls at the school made Harris' eventual arrest unsurprising.|$|E
5|$|The growing family, {{which came}} to include eight children, spent its winters in Berlin and summers in Potsdam; the year also usually {{included}} a stay in the country, to the delight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> <b>In</b> 1863 Vicky and Frederick purchased a run-down property and refurbished it into a farm, allowing the family to periodically experience a simple country life. Frederick was a loving husband, but as {{an officer in the}} Prussian army, his duties increasingly pulled him away from the home. Vicky was an intellectually demanding mother who expected her children to exhibit moral and political leadership, and in her husband's absence she carefully supervised their education and upbringing. Shortly after arriving in her new adopted country, Vicky observed the continuous arguments and intrigues within the Prussian royal family. This bolstered her belief in the superiority of English culture; she raised her children in English-style nurseries, and successfully fostered a love of her native country by incorporating aspects of English culture in the home and taking them on frequent trips to England.|$|E
5|$|Travers' working {{relationship}} with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy. Disney and his people are puzzled by Travers' disdain for fantasy, {{given the nature of}} the Mary Poppins story, as well as Travers' own rich imagination. She particularly objects to how the character George Banks, the estranged father <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> Mary Poppins' charge, is depicted, insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel. Gradually, they grasp how deeply personal the Mary Poppins stories are to her and how many of the characters were inspired by her past.|$|E

25|$|Women's clubs helped {{establish}} juvenile courts.

The Chicago Woman's Club also established a Protective Agency for Women and Children in 1886.|$|E
25|$|The bequest allowed Stevenson {{to travel}} extensively, {{sometimes}} {{as much as}} 55,000 miles a year, collecting around three thousand case studies {{based on interviews with}} children from Africa to Alaska. Stevenson wrote that sixty-one per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> these cases claimed to recall lives that had ended violently. According to Christopher Bache, the rest had died young (under the age of twelve years), or suddenly after a brief illness, or with a sense of unfinished business.|$|E

25|$|St. Joseph Roman Catholic Church was {{established}} in 1845 at {{the northwest corner of}} Lake Avenue and Ridge Road. In 1873, the church opened a school. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> Gross Point attended school at St. Joseph, where they were taught by nuns from Milwaukee's School Sisters of St. Francis. The German language was frequently used in the classrooms up until World War I, when the school abandoned this practice due to anti-German feeling in the United States.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 {{study of}} nearly 57,000 British nine- and ten-year-olds {{reported}} a prevalence of 3.89 per 1,000 for autism and 11.61 per 1,000 for ASD; these higher figures could {{be associated with}} broadening diagnostic criteria. Studies based on more detailed information, such as direct observation rather than examination of medical records, identify higher prevalence; this suggests that published figures may underestimate ASD's true prevalence. A 2009 study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> Cambridgeshire, England used different methods to measure prevalence, and estimated that 40% of ASD cases go undiagnosed, with the two least-biased estimates of true prevalence being 11.3 and 15.7 per 1,000.|$|E
25|$|Quentin Alice Louise Strachan {{was born}} in 1942 in Brisbane, the second of four daughters.

25|$|Despite {{plentiful}} resources, {{the country}} lacks sustainable pragmatic policies to combat poverty. Hania Sholkamy, an {{economist for the}} Social Research Center at the American University in Cairo, disclosed that although the government had subsidized 270 million loaves of bread/day at 19 Piasters/piece, 29 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> Egypt remained malnourished. Although these policies were adopted {{in an attempt to}} reduce economic burdens on the poor, they benefited the rich more which caused more problems to the poor and increased the burdens of the government. In fact, 83 percent of food subsidy, 76 percent of electricity subsidy, 87 percent of petroleum subsidy and 76 percent of the social safety net subsidy went to the non-poor instead of the poor.|$|E
25|$|The Geophysical Institute of Tromsø {{established}} a geophysical station at Kvadehuken in 1920, {{consisting of a}} small hut and a radio mast allowing communication via Ny-Ålesund. It carried out meteorological surveys and geomagnetic field measurements and was manned by four men. Two of these died in February 1922 while attempting to rescue a trapper. The station was closed in 1924 {{due to lack of}} funding. The Church of Norway never {{established a}} presence in Ny-Ålesund, although the minister at Svalbard Church in Longyearbyen visited Ny-Ålesund irregularly.

In 1925, as her own children and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> care came of school age, she got the idea to turn the orphanage into a landschulheim (boarding school). Landschulheim Herrlingen opened on 1 May 1926 as a private boarding school with 18 children ranging in age from 6 to 12. Anna Essinger became head of the school and her sister Paula, a trained nurse, became the school nurse and its housekeeper. The ceremonies to open the school were attended by Theodor Heuss and Otto Hirsch from Stuttgart, as well as the mayors of Göppingen and Ulm.|$|E
