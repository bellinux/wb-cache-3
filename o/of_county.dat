5|$|Introduction of the Local Government Bill in March 1888 caused {{much debate}} in the Potteries about the {{position}} of the towns under the proposed council structure. The bill proposed the creation <b>of</b> <b>county</b> councils across England and Wales and the granting <b>of</b> <b>county</b> borough status to towns with a population exceeding 100,000. County borough status would allow such places to govern themselves independently of the county council.|$|E

5|$|What is now Route 147 was an {{unimproved}} {{road back}} in 1927.

The route was also designated as part <b>of</b> <b>County</b> Route 18, which continued west past U.S. Route 9 to Route 47. In 1971, Route 147 was designated to replace the portion <b>of</b> <b>County</b> Route 18/County Route 585 between U.S. Route 9 in Burleigh and the North Wildwood border. As {{a result of a}} bridge replacement over the Grassy Sound, Route 147 was realigned off its former drawbridge, and the former alignment became Cape May County Route 665. The southern terminus <b>of</b> <b>County</b> Route 585 was eventually truncated its current location at Route 52 in Somers Point. By the 1990s, Route 147 was extended to its current terminus at New York Avenue in North Wildwood.|$|E
