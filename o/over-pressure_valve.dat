25|$|The {{pressure}} {{changes during}} ascent and descent may affect gas {{spaces in the}} diver and diving equipment. A change in pressure will cause a pressure difference between the gas space and environment which will cause the gas to expand or compress if that is possible, and constraining the gas from expanding or compressing to balance the pressure may cause damage to the surrounding material or tissues by over-expansion or crushing. Some gas spaces, such as the mask, will automatically release excess gas as it expands, but have to be equalized during compression, others, such as the buoyancy compensator bladder, will expand until the <b>over-pressure</b> <b>valve</b> opens. The ears are a special case, as they will usually vent naturally through the Eustachian tubes, but these may be blocked. During descent they do not usually equalize automatically, and must be intentionally equalized by the diver, using one of several possible methods. Most of the physiological airway automatically equalizes {{as long as the}} diver is breathing normally, but holding the breath can prevent equalization of the lower airways and lungs, which can lead to barotrauma.|$|E
2500|$|A {{downstream}} valve will {{function as}} an <b>over-pressure</b> <b>valve</b> when the inter-stage pressure is raised sufficiently to overcome the spring pre-load. If the first stage leaks and the inter-stage over-pressurizes, the second stage downstream valve opens automatically. if the leak is bad this {{could result in a}} [...] "freeflow", but a slow leak will generally cause intermittent [...] "popping" [...] of the DV, as the pressure is released and slowly builds up again.|$|E
2500|$|A {{gas panel}} or gas {{manifold}} is the control equipment for supplying the breathing gas to the divers. Primary and reserve gas is supplied {{to the panel}} through shutoff valves from a low-pressure compressor or high-pressure storage cylinders ("bombs", [...] "quads", or [...] "kellys"). The gas pressure may be controlled at the panel by an industrial pressure regulator, or it may already be regulated closer to the source (at the compressor, or at the storage cylinder outlet). The supply gas pressure is monitored on a gauge at the panel, and an <b>over-pressure</b> <b>valve</b> is fitted in case the supply pressure is too high. The gas panel may be operated by the diving supervisor if the breathing gas is air or a fixed ratio premix, but if the composition must be controlled or monitored during the dive it is usual for a dedicated gas panel operator, or [...] "gas man" [...] to do this work.|$|E
5000|$|... 6 28 September 1938 - Further {{test flight}} {{on behalf of}} the RLM under Captain Sammt. Zeppelin Company {{physicist}} Max Dieckmann was on board to investigate whether electrostatic charges caused the Hindenburg disaster. Therefore, it was especially flown during thunderstorms, as flights during normal weather conditions brought no useful results. The ship was flown into the stormfront slack (gas cells under-expanded), to prevent the <b>over-pressure</b> <b>valves</b> releasing hydrogen. The trip lasted nearly 26 hours; covering over 2,500 km. The ballast water recovery system fulfilled the engineers' expectations by producing about nine tons of water.|$|R
50|$|An <b>over-pressure</b> safety <b>valve</b> {{is usually}} {{installed}} inline between the compressor and the storage units {{to protect the}} cylinders from overfilling, and each cylinder may also be protected by a rupture disc.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic power {{networks}} used pipes {{to carrying}} pressurized water and transmit mechanical {{power from the}} source to end users. The power source was normally a head of water, which could also be assisted by a pump. These were extensive in Victorian cities in the United Kingdom. A hydraulic power network was also developed in Geneva, Switzerland. The world-famous Jet d'Eau was originally designed as the <b>over-pressure</b> relief <b>valve</b> for the network.|$|R

25|$|Manual and {{electronically}} controlled addition valves {{are used}} on manual and electronically controlled {{closed circuit rebreathers}} (mCCR, eCCR) to add oxygen to the loop to maintain set-point. A manually or electronically controlled valve is used to release oxygen from the outlet of a standard scuba regulator first stage into the breathing loop. An <b>over-pressure</b> relief <b>valve</b> on the first stage is necessary to protect the hose. Strictly speaking, these are not pressure regulators, they are flow control valves.|$|R
50|$|Excessive heat or {{pressure}} {{may cause}} {{the system to}} fail. At least one combination over-temperature and <b>over-pressure</b> relief <b>valve</b> is always fitted to the system to allow the steam or water to vent to the atmosphere in case {{of the failure of}} some mechanism (such as the boiler temperature control) rather than allowing the catastrophic bursting of the piping, radiators, or boiler. The relief valve usually has a manual operating handle to allow testing and the flushing of contaminants (such as grit) that may cause the valve to leak under otherwise-normal operating conditions.|$|R
25|$|Rapid {{deployment}} lift bags have a scuba cylinder {{mounted on}} the outside which contains sufficient air to inflate the bag at a specified depth. The bag can {{be attached to the}} load and when ready, the valve is opened and the diver swims clear. If the regulator pressure is set to a lower pressure than the <b>over-pressure</b> relief <b>valve,</b> a closed bag will automatically stop filling before the relief valve opens, but will be topped up if it leaks after reaching the surface. The regulator pressure must take into account the hydrostatic pressure difference between {{the top and bottom of}} the bag so that the bag will be completely filled.|$|R
25|$|Constant {{mass flow}} {{addition}} valves {{are used to}} supply a constant mass flow of fresh gas to an active type semi-closed rebreather to replenish the gas used by the diver and to maintain an approximately constant composition of the loop mix. Two main types are used: the fixed orifice and the adjustable orifice (usually a needle valve). The constant mass flow valve is usually based on a gas regulator that is isolated from the ambient pressure so that it provides an absolute pressure regulated output (not compensated for ambient pressure). This limits the depth range in which constant mass flow is possible through the orifice, but provides a relatively predictable gas mixture in the breathing loop. An <b>over-pressure</b> relief <b>valve</b> {{in the first stage}} is used to protect the output hose. Unlike most other diving regulators, these do not control the downstream pressure, but they do regulate the flow rate.|$|R
