The first was shot in two locations in Brazil, in Pelourinho, the historic city center of Salvador, and in a favela <b>of</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro</b> called Dona Marta, where the state authorities had tried to ban all production over fears the video would damage their image, the area and prospects <b>of</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro</b> staging the 2004 Olympics. Still, {{the residents of the}} area were happy to see the singer, hoping their problems would be made visible to a wider audience. The second video was shot in a prison and contained video footage of multiple references to human rights abuses.|$|E
5|$|The Rio de Janeiro bid {{committee}} was an incorporated non-profit entity {{under the leadership}} of an Honorary Council and an Executive Board, both chaired by Carlos Arthur Nuzman. At the highest level, the Honorary Council comprised the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the Governor of the State <b>of</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro</b> Sérgio Cabral, the Mayor of the Municipality <b>of</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro</b> Eduardo Paes, and the two Brazilian IOC members: Nuzman and João Havelange. At the executive level, the Executive Board was divided in four departments—Government Coordination Commission, Business Council, Legacy Committee and Athletes' Commission—being responsible for the main operations of the campaign. The Board also included representations from the three levels of Government with the specific authority to make commitments on behalf of their respective Governments. Technical aspects of the bid were supported by various Councils and Committees composed of a professionals staff, and supplemented by a team of domestic and international experts; which were coordinated by Carlos Roberto Osório, Secretary General of the bid committee. Mike Lee, former Director of Communications and Public Affairs for the London bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, was the lead advisor to the bid <b>of</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro.</b> His company, Vero Campaigning Communications, was responsible for planning the bid's advertising campaign strategy, presentation scripts, visual support development and international media relations, as well as international press conferences.|$|E

5|$|As the {{commander}} of the Permanent Municipal Guard Corps, Luís Alves brought order to the streets <b>of</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro,</b> through his own skill and through partnership with the city's chief of police, Eusébio de Queirós.

Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, one of the leading Reactionaries and a government minister, attempted to attract Luís Alves to his party.|$|E
5|$|Atlético {{also holds}} a rivalry with Flamengo <b>of</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro,</b> {{with the first}} match between the clubs being played in 1929.

The rivalry developed in the 1980s, rising from numerous controversial encounters between the two clubs in Campeonato Brasileiro and Copa Libertadores editions of the period. It remained through the following decades, and is considered the biggest interstate rivalry in Brazilian football.|$|E

He had neither noble rank nor noble ancestry and lacked patrons in {{an environment in which}} advancement depended upon exchanges of favors and family connections.

5|$|The Brazilian Olympic Committee (COB) chose Rio de Janeiro as its bidding city to {{host the}} 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, during its Annual Assembly on September 1, 2006. This was the city's first bid that {{proceeded}} to the Candidature phase, after three failed attempts {{to host the}} Games in 1936, 2004 and 2012. The lengthy and intensive bidding process was concluded with the election <b>of</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro</b> as the host city during the 121st IOC Session, held in Copenhagen, Denmark, on October 2, 2009.

5|$|The {{territory}} {{which would}} {{come to be known}} as Brazil was claimed by Portugal on 22 April 1500, when the navigator Pedro Álvares Cabral landed on its coast. Permanent settlement followed in 1532, and for the next 300 years the Portuguese slowly expanded westwards until they had reached nearly all of the borders of modern Brazil. In 1808, the army of French Emperor Napoleon I invaded Portugal, forcing the Portuguese royal family—the House of Braganza, a branch of the thousand-year-old Capetian dynasty—into exile. They re-established themselves in the Brazilian city <b>of</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro,</b> which became the unofficial seat of the Portuguese Empire.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} from Maranhão, Caxias saw that the {{political}} climate had changed. Francisco de Lima's Liberal Party had pushed through the premature declaration of the Emperor's majority on 23 July 1840. In May 1842, the Liberals rebelled in the provinces <b>of</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro,</b> São Paulo and Minas Gerais {{in retaliation for the}} Emperor's decision—on the advice of a Council of State dominated by Reactionaries—to call for new elections, annulling the previous election tainted by widespread fraud by the Liberal Party.|$|E
5|$|After Rio de Janeiro was {{purchased}} by the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would have been devoted to internal improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the Argentine National Congress in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, Italian, and Greek governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase <b>of</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro.</b>|$|E

The New York Tribune (2 November 1913) and Proceedings (May and June 1914) reported that Greece had reached an accord to purchase the first battleship counterbalance the Ottoman Empire's acquisition <b>of</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro</b> from Brazil, but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell {{one or both of the}} dreadnoughts, no deal was made.|$|E
5|$|On 20 May 1826, Honório Hermeto {{married his}} 17-year-old first cousin Maria Henriqueta Neto, the {{daughter}} of his father's brother João Neto Carneiro Leme. Unlike his brother, João Neto was a rich and influential man. Honório Hermeto and Maria Henriqueta had five children: Honório, Henrique (later Baron of Paraná), Maria Emília, Maria Henriqueta and Pedro. The advantageous marriage allowed Honório Hermeto to become a slave owner, assume his uncle's business, which included domestic slave trading, and later, in the 1830s, purchase a coffee farm in the province <b>of</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro.</b> Coffee was quickly becoming Brazil's most important export commodity and was a highly lucrative crop.|$|E

Rio Branco rose to power within the province under the tutelage of Aureliano Coutinho, Viscount of Sepetiba—a veteran politician who held tremendous influence over the young and inexperienced Emperor PedroII. He temporarily abandoned politics after Aureliano Coutinho's fall from grace and the subsequent dissolution of the Liberal Party.|$|E
