Construction was delayed by changes to the design and late deliveries <b>of</b> <b>components.</b> She was launched on 28 August 1868 and then transferred to Kronstadt for fitting out as the shallow waters around Saint Petersburg prevented deep-draft ships from being completed. This added more delays as the dockyard there lacked the equipment to efficiently fit out the ships, and she officially entered service in 1869 {{at the cost of}} 1,177,500 rubles.|$|E
5|$|After the {{announcement}} of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to a shortage <b>of</b> <b>components</b> such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} various classifications <b>of</b> <b>component</b> interoperability errors. These classifications aim at {{supporting the}} automation <b>of</b> <b>component</b> adaptation. The use <b>of</b> software <b>components</b> will only demonstrate beneficial, if the costs for component deployment (i. e., acquisition and composition) are considerably {{lower than those}} for custom <b>component</b> development. One <b>of</b> {{the main reasons for}} the moderate progress in component-based software engineering are the high costs for component deployment. These costs are mainly caused by adapting components to bridge interoperability errors between unfitting components. One way to lower the costs <b>of</b> <b>component</b> deployment is to support component adaptation by tools, i. e., for interoperability checks of (semi-) automated adaptor generation. This automation <b>of</b> <b>component</b> adaptation requires a deep understanding <b>of</b> <b>component</b> interoperability errors. In particular, one has to differentiate between different classes of interoperability errors, as different errors require different adaptors for resolving. Therefore, the presented classification <b>of</b> <b>component</b> interoperability errors supports the automation <b>of</b> <b>component</b> adaptation by aiding automated interoperability problem detection and semi-automated adaptor generation. The experience gained from already implemented solutions for a specific class of interoperability errors provides hints for the solution of similar problems of the same class. ...|$|R

Vertical products like SAS Financial Management and SAS Human Capital Management (then called CFO Vision and HR Vision respectively) were also introduced. JMP was developed by SAS co-founder John Sall and a team of developers {{to take advantage of the}} graphical user interface introduced in the 1984 Apple Macintosh and shipped for the first time in 1989.

The Civilization board game that gave rise to Sid Meier's Civilization computer game, for instance, has no exploration and no extermination. Unless extermination is targeted at non-player entities, it tends to be either nearly impossible (because of play balance mechanisms, since player elimination is usually considered an undesirable feature) or certainly unachievable (because victory conditions are triggered before extermination can be completed) in board games.|$|E
5|$|Martin, Odlyzko, and Wolfram {{investigate}} pseudoforests {{that model}} {{the dynamics of}} cellular automata. These functional graphs, which they call state transition diagrams, have one vertex for each possible configuration that the ensemble of cells of the automaton can be in, and an edge connecting each configuration to the configuration that follows it according to the automaton's rule. One can infer properties of the automaton from the structure of these diagrams, such as the number <b>of</b> <b>components,</b> length of limiting cycles, depth of the trees connecting non-limiting states to these cycles, or symmetries of the diagram. For instance, any vertex with no incoming edge corresponds to a Garden of Eden pattern and a vertex with a self-loop corresponds to a still life pattern.|$|E
5|$|Production <b>of</b> <b>components</b> {{would be}} split between Breguet and BAC, and the {{aircraft}} themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining {{the illusion of a}} shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree that}} it was for all intents and purposes a new design.|$|E

To expedite the process, maximum use was made <b>of</b> <b>components</b> of the Tu-70. Its engines were the uprated Shvetsov ASh-73TKFN or TKNV fuel-injected version. A new, narrower fuselage was designed, which included a rear cargo hatch, a vehicle loading ramp and paratroop exit doors. Three gun turrets (dorsal, ventral and tail), were to be adapted from the Tu-4, although they were not fitted on the prototype. It had a crew of six (two pilots, three gunners, a radio operator, and a navigator).|$|E

5|$|The {{detailed}} design {{work for the}} new mixed-traffic locomotives was undertaken at Brighton railway works where they were scheduled to be constructed. The earliest drawings were for a moderately sized 2-6-0 with similarities to the London and North Eastern Railway K4class, which Bulleid had helped design for the West Highland Line when he was Nigel Gresley's assistant. However, such a design would have been inadequate for the Kent Coast lines, which required a powerful 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 class. It is not clear why the design was subsequently enlarged to become a smaller version of the Merchant Navy class 4-6-2 as the likely traffic requirement did not warrant such lavish provision, but the incorporation <b>of</b> <b>components</b> from that class enabled standardisation during wartime production difficulties.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only <b>of</b> <b>components</b> with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E
