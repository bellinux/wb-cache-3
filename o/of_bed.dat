5|$|Berlin's {{civilian}} {{work schedule}} {{had been that}} of a hardworking night owl, generally writing material until two or three in the morning.

40|$|Taking care <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> is part <b>of</b> nurses {{everyday}} work. The way a bed looks {{influences the}} patients {{physical and mental}} state. Care <b>of</b> the <b>bed</b> involves its arrangement, exchanging used bed-linen and especially disinfection, which prevents the transfer of nosocomial infections. The objectives of the thesis was to survey the way nurses take care <b>of</b> <b>beds,</b> identify obstacles associated with the care <b>of</b> <b>beds,</b> and propose a basis for creating a standard care <b>of</b> <b>beds.</b> 3 research questions were set. Research question 1 : How does the length of patients stay on the bed depend on the frequency of its disinfection in practice? Research question 2 : Do nurses consider the care <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> {{from the point of}} view of the work schedule or the patients comfort? Research question 3 : What are the most frequent obstacles in the care <b>of</b> <b>beds?</b> The research was conducted by means of a structured observation, followed by a follow-up recording in the record sheet. An anonymous questioning was conducted to obtain results. 8 nurses present in the department took part in the observation and questioning in the course of research investigation. The research set consisted of nurses in the subsequent care of the CTM Hospital a. s. in Humpolec. The investigation results let us set hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 : The overall disinfection <b>of</b> the <b>bed</b> is done after the patient is discharged from the hospital. Hypothesis 2 : Nurses take care <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> according to work schedule. Hypothesis 3 : An obstacle in the arrangement <b>of</b> the <b>bed</b> is the lack of clean bed-linen. The investigation results may be provided to the management of the department in which the investigation was conducted. They may result in an improvement of the care <b>of</b> <b>beds.</b> A proposal <b>of</b> the nursing standard of the care <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> was drawn up as the result of this investigation. This proposal may serve for unifying the care <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> in individual departments. Setting principles and the overall procedure in the care <b>of</b> <b>beds...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{quantity}} <b>of</b> <b>bedding</b> {{consumption in}} {{different type of}} housing dairy cows was investigated. There was investigated the consumption <b>of</b> <b>bedding</b> in old barns with the stanchion length of 2, 55 m, new barn with the stanchion length of 1, 60 a, Louse housing without boxes and house housing with boxes. There was found that during the year the average quantity <b>of</b> <b>bedding</b> necessary to reach minimum of hygiene and comfort was per cow/day: a) 3, 64 kg <b>of</b> <b>bedding</b> in stanchion barns with the length of stanchion of 2, 55 m; b) 2, 00 kg <b>of</b> <b>bedding</b> in stanchion barns with the length of stanchion of 1, 6 m; c) over 4, 7 kg in loose housing barns without boxes; d) 2 kg in loose housing with boxes...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of a series <b>of</b> packed <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> non-equilateral cylindrical particles has been investigated and compared with those <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> spheres and equilateral cylinders of similar dimensions. It is found that the mean voidage <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> equilateral cylinders is consistently lower than the corresponding values for <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> spheres and non-equilateral cylinders of aspect ratios 0. 25, 0. 5, 2 and 3. End effects {{do not appear to}} be present in <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> cylinders of aspect ratios of 0. 25 and 0. 5 and generally, both wall and end effects are significantly weaker than corresponding effects in <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> spheres and equilateral cylinders. This suggests that chanelling is reduced in <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> non-equilateral cylindrical pellets. Whilst the axial voidage distribution <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> non-equilateral cylinders appears to be almost uniform, the radial voidage distribution bears the effect of confining walls and an oscillatory profile is observed in most cases, but is seen to be irregular for aspect ratios 0. 25 and 0. 5. The orientation effect of particles of aspect ratio 0. 25 in adjacent layers causes an irregular pattern in the axially averaged radial voidage distribution. Observed axially averaged radial voidage profiles suggest that a uniform structure may be achieved by modifying the basic cylindrical shape. 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for this condition is the surgical application of epidural blood patches, which has a higher success rate than conservative treatments <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> rest and hydration. Through the injection of a person's own blood into {{the area of the}} hole in the dura, an epidural blood patch uses blood's clotting factors to clot the sites of holes. The volume of autologous blood and number of patch attempts for patients is highly variable. One-quarter to one-third of SCSFLS patients do not have relief of symptoms from epidural blood patching.|$|E

5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised to get out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E

Near the end of his life Mercury was starting to lose his sight, and he deteriorated to the point where he could not get out <b>of</b> <b>bed.</b> Due to his worsening condition, Mercury decided to hasten his death by refusing to take his medication and continued taking only painkillers.|$|E

5|$|Coming in at 7/173, Meckiff top-scored with 55—his only {{first-class}} 50—as Victoria batted {{first and}} made a late recovery to end with 244. Meckiff took 3/65, including the wickets of Test players Bill Watson and Richie Benaud as New South Wales responded with 281. In the Victorian second innings Meckiff managed only 8 as Victoria left their opponents a target of 161 runs for victory. The paceman took 4/56 and claimed the final wicket, removing Test opener Jim Burke caught for 8 as New South Wales mustered 160, causing the match to end in the first tie in Shield history. Burke had returned to bat after being injured earlier in the innings, while New South Wales captain Ian Craig, who had been ill, hauled himself out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> {{in an attempt to}} salvage the match after his team had fallen to 7/70. Meckiff's other victims in the final innings included Test players Alan Davidson and Johnny Martin.|$|E

At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E

She got pregnant again, and she and Colin married at Chelmsford Registry Office in May 1977 when Sheila was 20, but she lost the baby at six months. The Bambers bought the couple a garden flat in Carlingford Road, Hampstead, to help Sheila recuperate. She suffered another miscarriage, then on 22 June 1979, after four months <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> rest in hospital, {{she gave birth to}} the twins.

Sheila became increasingly upset; on one occasion, when Colin left a party with another woman, she required hospital treatment after breaking a window with her fist. The couple divorced in May 1982.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Kaganovich {{arrived in}} Kiev, Khrushchev fell ill, and was barely seen until September 1947. In his memoirs, Khrushchev {{indicates}} he had pneumonia; some biographers have theorized that Khrushchev's illness was entirely political, {{out of fear}} that his loss of position was the first step towards downfall and demise. However, Khrushchev's children remembered their father as having been seriously ill. Once Khrushchev was able to get out <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> he and his family took their first vacation since before the war, to a beachfront resort in Latvia. Khrushchev, though, soon broke the beach routine with duck-hunting trips, and a visit to newly Soviet Kaliningrad, where he toured factories and quarries. By the end of 1947, Kaganovich had been recalled to Moscow and the recovered Khrushchev had been restored to the First Secretaryship. He then resigned the Ukrainian premiership in favor of Demyan Korotchenko, Khrushchev's protégé.|$|E
