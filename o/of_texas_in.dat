5|$|By {{the time}} that the United States entered World War II in 1941, oil was a vital part of {{military}} operations around the world. The United States produced 60 percent of the world's crude oil, with the state <b>of</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>in</b> the south-west leading this production, producing {{more than twice as much}} crude as any other state. The industry comprised a handful of very large producers and more than 3,500 smaller operators.|$|E

5|$|Chastain's {{final two}} {{roles of the}} year were in Wilde Salomé, a {{documentary}} based on her 2006 production of Salome, and the critically panned crime-thriller Texas Killing Fields.

Los Angeles Times Betsy Sharkey praised Chastain's polished Texas drawl, but criticized the film. Chastain's work in 2011, especially in The Help, Take Shelter and The Tree of Life, gained her awards from several critics' organizations, including the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.|$|E

5|$|From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian {{democracy}} began a set {{of reforms}} which included wider white male suffrage; {{it led to the}} rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that resettled Indians into the west on Indian reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>in</b> 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny. The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest. Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Naomi was a {{short-lived}} Category 1 hurricane that made landfall in Mexico's Pacific coast during the 1968 Pacific hurricane season. After rapidly intensifying before its landfall in Sinaloa, Naomi caused rainfall throughout northern Mexico and the U.S. state <b>of</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>in</b> association with a frontal system, {{with the highest}} measurement occurring in Corpus Christi. Four people perished in Mexico due to Naomi's effects with ten more missing, all in Sinaloa. The only reported injury in Texas due to the remnants was a factory worker who was injured when {{the roof of the}} plant they were working in collapsed due to rainfall.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, U.S. President John Tyler, unaligned {{with any}} {{political}} party, decided independently {{to pursue the}} annexation <b>of</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>in</b> a bid to gain a base of popular support for another four years in office. His official motivation was to outmaneuver suspected diplomatic efforts by the British government for emancipation of slaves in Texas, which would undermine slavery in the United States. Through secret negotiations with the Houston administration, Tyler secured a treaty of annexation in April 1844. When the documents were submitted to the US Senate for ratification, {{the details of the}} terms of annexation became public and the question of acquiring Texas took center stage in the presidential election of 1844.|$|E

5|$|Regular Democrats {{were forced}} to call for {{annexation}} <b>of</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>in</b> their platform, {{but there was a}} bitter battle for the presidential nomination. Ballot after ballot, Van Buren failed to win the necessary super-majority of Democratic votes, and slowly fell in the rankings. It was not until the ninth ballot that the Democrats turned their sights to James K. Polk, a less prominent candidate who supported annexation. They found him to be perfectly suited for their platform, and he was nominated with two-thirds of the vote. Tyler considered his work vindicated, and implied in an acceptance letter that annexation was his true priority rather than election.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} East Texas Normal College (ETNC) {{comprises}} {{the history of}} the university now known as Texas A University–Commerce from its foundation as a private normal college in 1889 to its acquisition by the State <b>of</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>in</b> 1917. It was founded in Cooper by Kentucky native William L. Mayo, who served as its president from its foundation until his death in 1917, and moved to Commerce after its original campus burned down in 1894. A popular school for active teachers seeking state certification or recertification, it was largely shaped by Mayo's own personal beliefs about education, which focused on participation and hands-on learning instead of memorization or rote learning.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Lidia, in {{combination of a}} cold front, prompted a tornado watch and flash flood watch for much <b>of</b> <b>Texas.</b> <b>In</b> Texas, six tornadoes were reported, {{with one of them}} causing over $8million (1993 USD) in damage. The Dallas-Fort Worth area was hit hard. Strong winds, tornadoes and torrential downpours left broken trees, damaged buildings, and minor injuries {{in the wake of the}} storm. Johnson, Denton, Collin, Tarrant, and Dallas counties were the hardest hit. In northern Arlington, five people were injured when a roof was torn off of a hotel.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Arlene brought torrential {{rainfall}} to {{the western}} United States Gulf Coast, particularly to the U.S. state <b>of</b> <b>Texas,</b> <b>in</b> June1993. The first named storm of the annual hurricane season, Arlene developed from an {{area of low pressure}} in the Bay of Campeche on June18. The depression slowly strengthened as it tracked west-northwestward and later north-northwestward across the western Gulf of Mexico. Arlene was subsequently upgraded to a tropical storm on June19, but failed to intensify further due to its proximity to land. The cyclone then made landfall on Padre Island, Texas, with winds of 40mph (65km/h) and degenerated into a remnant disturbance on June21.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Norman brought minor {{flooding}} {{to western}} Mexico and record rainfall to areas <b>of</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>in</b> September 2012. The fourteenth tropical cyclone and fourteenth named storm of the 2012 Pacific hurricane season, Norman developed near {{the southern tip}} of Baja California early on September28. Upon developing into a tropical cyclone on September28, Norman attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h). Heading northward into the Gulf of California, the storm began to weaken later that day due to southwesterly wind shear and land interaction. Norman curved northwestward and weakened to a tropical depression early on September29. Around that time, it briefly moved inland near Topolobampo, Sinaloa, before re-emerging into the Gulf of California. Later on September29, Norman degenerated into a remnant low pressure area.|$|E
5|$|As built, both ships {{also carried}} 21 /51 caliber guns arrayed ten {{to a side}} with one in the stern, {{primarily}} for defense against destroyers and torpedo boats. Many of the 5-inch guns were poor in accuracy in rough seas due to being mounted near {{the ends of the}} ship and below the main deck. The ships were not designed with anti-aircraft (AA) defense in mind, and with the development of naval aviation, this was seen as a serious drawback to the class. The New York class was the first US battleship to mount anti-aircraft guns, with two /50 caliber guns mounted on platforms on top of the boat cranes <b>of</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>in</b> 1916. In 1918, the secondary armament was reduced to 16 5-inch/51 caliber guns, eight to a side, as the guns near the ends of the ship were difficult to work in any kind of sea. When both ships were refitted 1925-26, AA defense was increased with eight 3-inch/50 caliber guns arrayed four to a side. Six of the 16 remaining 5-inch guns were relocated higher in the ship to new casemates on the main deck. The New York class also initially featured four torpedo tubes, 1 each on the port side bow and stern and starboard bow and stern, for the Bliss-Leavitt Mark 3 torpedo, instead of the previous two, because of advances in torpedo performance increasing the prominence of the weapon. The torpedo rooms held 12 torpedoes total, plus 12 naval defense mines. However, the torpedo tubes were removed in the 1925-26 refit.|$|E
