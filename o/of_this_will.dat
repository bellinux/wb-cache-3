The natural reflex is to attempt to defend one's head with a straight bat but this should be suppressed if possible as the likely result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> be that the ball flies off the bat at an uncontrolled angle making for an easy catch.

25|$|Nigamananda {{said that}} one should {{remember}} that death is coming. Before working on good or evil deeds one should also remember that death is not far off. Contemplating death drives away the desire for sensual pleasure and evil thoughts and stops acts of injustice. Attachment to wealth and relations will then diminish. Earthly matters remain even after departure from this world. Only spiritual wealth remains as an asset to the individual. Those who have puffed with pride on account of their accomplishments will submit to the God of death meekly when that hour comes. Drunk with pride, some persons ill-treat their brethren.

This plan requires double track from Trondheim to Stjørdal, but such a solution through the tunnel has been disregarded.

2500|$|The normal {{convention}} in topological studies {{means that a}} protein is shown with the biggest domain on the left-hand side and the smallest domain on the right-hand side. In this position the smaller domain is in turn divided into two: subdomain I (lower position, residues 1-32, 70-144 and 338-374) and subdomain II (upper position, residues 33-69). The larger domain is also divided in two: subdomain III (lower, residues 145-180 and 270-337) and subdomain IV (higher, residues 181-269). The exposed areas of subdomains I and III {{are referred to as}} the “barbed” ends, while the exposed areas of domains II and IV are termed the “pointed" [...] ends.

2500|$|When {{exchange}} rates are fixed by a rigid gold standard, or when imbalances exist {{between members of}} a currency union such as the Eurozone, the standard approach to correct imbalances is by making changes to the domestic economy. [...] To a large degree, the change is optional for the surplus country, but compulsory for the deficit country. [...] In {{the case of a}} gold standard, the mechanism is largely automatic. [...] When a country has a favourable trade balance, as a consequence of selling more than it buys it will experience a net inflow of gold. [...] The natural effect <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> be to increase the money supply, which leads to inflation and an increase in prices, which then tends to make its goods less competitive and so will decrease its trade surplus. [...] However the nation has the option of taking the gold out of economy (sterilising the inflationary effect) thus building up a hoard of gold and retaining its favourable balance of payments. On the other hand, if a country has an adverse BoP it will experience a net loss of gold, which will automatically have a deflationary effect, unless it chooses to leave the gold standard. Prices will be reduced, making its exports more competitive, and thus correcting the imbalance. While the gold standard is generally considered to have been successful up until 1914, correction by deflation to the degree required by the large imbalances that arose after WWI proved painful, with deflationary policies contributing to prolonged unemployment but not re-establishing balance. Apart from the US most former members had left the gold standard by the mid-1930s.|$|E
