5|$|Edward Samuel Miliband (born 24 December 1969) is a British {{politician}} who was Leader of the Labour Party {{as well as}} Leader of the <b>Opposition</b> <b>between</b> 2010 and 2015. He became the Member of Parliament (MP) for Doncaster North in 2005, being re-elected in 2010, 2015, and 2017, and served in the Cabinet from 2007-10 under Prime Minister Gordon Brown.|$|E
5|$|Gough Whitlam {{refused to}} use the title Leader of the <b>Opposition</b> <b>between</b> the {{dismissal}} of his government in November 1975 and {{the first meeting of}} the new parliament in February 1976. During the election campaign in December 1975 he styled himself as the Leader of the Majority in the House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|According to K. N. T. Sastry in {{his book}} Alanati Chalana Chitram, the film begins with the theme of Dhairye Sahase Lakshmi (Bravery gives wealth) which is present {{throughout}} the film. While the characters of Rama Rao and Ranga Rao epitomise heroism, {{the character of the}} princess played by Malathi epitomises innocence and sensuality. Pathala Bhairavi sets up an <b>opposition</b> <b>between</b> the worship of Rama by the protagonist's mother and the worship of Pathala Bhairavi by the sorcerer; the former being a frequent one inhabited in a domestic space while the latter being an uncivilised one.|$|E
50|$|Sarrasine {{is marked}} by oppositions. The story opens with a {{description}} of the extremes of inside and out, day and night, beauty and ugliness, age and youth, male and female that prevail in French high society and at the de Lanty's ball. Whereas the ball is young and full of life, the mysterious old man who enters it stands out as the mark of opposition. “If I look at him again, I shall believe that death itself has come looking for me,” says one beautiful young woman. The most significant opposite in the entire novella is male versus female. The story contemplates {{what it means to be}} a man and what it means to be a woman, and the degree to which those stand in opposition. The story also touches on <b>oppositions</b> <b>between</b> the generations, as Sarrasine himself is opposite to his father, on <b>oppositions</b> <b>between</b> the art world and the political world, on <b>oppositions</b> <b>between</b> France and Italy, and on <b>oppositions</b> <b>between</b> the ideal and the real.|$|R

25|$|There {{are strong}} <b>oppositions</b> <b>between</b> Pierre Bonnaud (for whom the Auvergnat is a {{language}} of its own, see the light orange line on the map – note it is including the easternmost part of the Marchois dialect) and for instance Roger Teulat.|$|R
5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The <b>opposition</b> <b>between</b> the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.|$|E
5|$|The discourses {{contained}} {{with this}} gospel {{seem to be}} concerned with issues of the church–synagogue debate at the time of composition. It is notable that in John, the community appears to define itself primarily in contrast to Judaism, rather than as part of a wider Christian community. Though Christianity started as a movement within Judaism, it gradually separated from Judaism because of mutual <b>opposition</b> <b>between</b> the two religions.|$|E
5|$|The offside {{rule was}} {{introduced}} to Sheffield Rules in 1863. Their version only required {{one member of the}} <b>opposition</b> <b>between</b> a player and the opposing goal to remain on side. Despite this the rule was only used sporadically in actual play. The FA version, which required a player to remain behind the ball at all times, was introduced during the 1865–66 season but was disliked {{due to the lack of}} goal scoring opportunities it caused. The one man offside was finally used a regular basis from 1867 until the adoption of FA rules in 1877.|$|E

5|$|All of {{the protagonists}} {{in the novel}} are misfits and social outcasts {{surrounded}} by an impersonal and largely antagonistic rural community, which is represented metonymically through minor or anonymous characters. Joanna Burden and Reverend Hightower are hounded {{by the people of}} Jefferson for years, in a failed effort to make them leave town. Byron Bunch, though more accepted in Jefferson, is still viewed as a mystery or simply overlooked. Both Joe Christmas and Lena Grove are orphans, strangers in town, and social outcasts, though the former draws anger and violence from the community, while the latter is looked down upon but receives generous assistance in her travels. According to Cleanth Brooks, this <b>opposition</b> <b>between</b> Joe and Lena is a pastoral reflection of the full spectrum of social alienation in modern society.|$|E
5|$|By 1929, {{several of}} the {{children}} were approaching the age to attend university and the family sought to move somewhere of a more congenial educational climate than Spain. That September, they moved to the Belgian village of Steenokkerzeel near Brussels, where they were closer to several members of their family. Zita continued her political lobbying on behalf of the Habsburg family, even sounding out links with Mussolini's Italy. There was even a possibility of a Habsburg restoration under the Austrian Chancellors Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg, with Crown Prince Otto visiting Austria numerous times. These overtures were abruptly ended by the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938. As exiles, the Habsburg family took the lead in resisting the Nazis in Austria, but this foundered because of <b>opposition</b> <b>between</b> monarchists and socialists.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians {{describe}} the Royal Question {{as an important}} moment in Belgian recovery after World War II. The <b>opposition</b> <b>between</b> Leopoldists and anti-Leopoldists led to the re-establishment of Socialist and Catholic political parties from before the war. The Question was also an important moment in the Belgian linguistic conflict. It also {{put an end to}} the federalisation of Belgian institutions which might exacerbate the regional tensions exposed by the Royal Question. In addition, the perceived failure of the PSC–CVP to realise Flemish demands for the return of Leopold helped to strengthen support for the Flemish nationalist Volksunie party after 1954. In Wallonia, the legacy of trade union and socialist political mobilisation during the general strike paved the way for a left-wing revival of the Walloon Movement.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issues that come with {{multicultural}} politics and cultural identity. Taking theories on difference from Gilles Deleuze as a starting point, {{the aim is to}} further develop multiculturalism and as such move beyond <b>oppositions</b> <b>between</b> sameness and difference, finally resulting in a more relational society. This thesis provides new ways of thinking, and new perspectives on multiculturalism, cultural identity and society...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{evidence}} {{will be provided}} that Wittgenstein’s intuition about the logic of colour relations is to be taken near-literally. Starting from the Aristotelian <b>oppositions</b> <b>between</b> propositions as represented in the logical square of oppositions {{on the one hand}} and <b>oppositions</b> <b>between</b> primary and secondary colors as represented in an octahedron on the other, it will be shown algebraically how definitions for the former carry over to the realm of colour categories and describe very precisely the relations obtaining between the known primary and secondary colours. Linguistic evidence for the reality of the resulting isomorphism will be provided. For example, the vertices that resist natural single-item lexicalization in logic (such as the O-corner, for which there is no natural lexicalization *nall (=not all)) are not naturally lexicalized in the realm of colour terms either. From the perspective of the architecture of cognition, the isomorphism suggests that the foundations of logical oppositions and negation may well be much more deeply rooted in the physiological structure of human cognition than is standardly assumed. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|The {{notion of}} dualism is {{maintained}} throughout Freud's various reformulations of the drive-theory. From the initial <b>opposition</b> <b>between</b> sexual drives and ego-drives (self-preservation) {{to the final}} one between the life drives (Lebenstriebe) and the death drives (Todestriebe). Lacan retains Freud's dualism {{but in terms of}} an <b>opposition</b> <b>between</b> the symbolic and the imaginary and not referred to different kinds of drives. For Lacan all drives are sexual drives, and every drive is a death drive (pulsion de mort) since every drive is excessive, repetitive and destructive.|$|E
25|$|The <b>opposition</b> <b>between</b> {{the schools}} of Ishmael and Akiva lessened gradually, and finally {{vanished}} altogether, so that the later tannaim apply the axioms of both indiscriminately, although the hermeneutics of Akiva predominated.|$|E
40|$|Starting {{from the}} Aristotelian <b>oppositions</b> <b>between</b> propositions as {{represented}} in the logical square of oppositions {{on the one hand}} and the <b>oppositions</b> <b>between</b> colors as represented in Höfler’s (1897) octahedron, it will be shown algebraically how definitions for the relations of opposition in predicate logic – entailment, contradiction, contrariety and subcontrariety – carry over to the realm of colour percepts and describe very precisely the relations obtaining between the known primary and secondary colours. This result has several interesting consequences from a linguistic, cognitive and philosophical perspective. Linguistically, there is the fact that the vertices that resist single item lexicalization in logic are also those that are hard to lexicalize in the realm of colours. From the perspective of the architecture of cognition, the isomorphism suggests that the logical oppositions may be as deeply rooted in the physiological structure of human cognition as the colour oppositions. Philosophically speaking, finally, a comparison of the algebras of logic and colour offers a new perspective from which to look at the age-old colour incompatibility problem. References HÖFLER, A.
