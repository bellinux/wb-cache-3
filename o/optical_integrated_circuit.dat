The application for these devices is dominantly seen to be in wafer scale testing for optical integrated circuits, though the planar surface may offer benefits in other areas such as 3 dimensional optical circuits. Wafer scale testing is critical to reducing production costs and increasing production yield. In this thesis a method that allows testing of individual optical components within a complex <b>optical</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> is described. The method is based on diffractive grating couplers,which {{can be used to}} efficiently couple light from an optical fibre to a silicon waveguide. In this work gratings are fabricated by the introduction of lattice disorder,induced by ion implantation of germanium opposed to the typical surface relief structure typically used. The lattice damage alters the crystalline structure of silicon, hence causing a change in the refractive index. Coupling performance determined empirically, showed a 5. 5 dB loss between the fibre and planar waveguide modes,which is not dissimilar to the performance of typical uniform surface relief gratings currently used. Gratings fabricated using this method can be erased via localised laser annealing after device testing is completed. Annealing is shown reduce the outcoupling efficiency of the gratings fabricated by ~ 21 dB. Laser annealing was achieved by employing a continuous wave laser, operating at visible wavelengths thus reducing equipment costs compared with traditional annealing systems, which use a pulsed, deep ultra violet laser.
