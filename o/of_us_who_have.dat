"Padre Pio {{looked at}} Lefebvre very sternly and said: [...] "Never cause discord among your {{brothers}} and always practise {{the rule of}} obedience; above all when it seems {{to you that the}} errors of those in authority are all the more serious. There is no other road than that of obedience, especially for those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> made this vow."... It seems Archbishop Lefebvre did not see things in quite the same way even if he did respond to Padre Pio with: [...] "I will remember that, Father." [...] Padre Pio looked at him intensely and, seeing what would soon happen, said: [...] "No! You will forget it! You will tear apart the community of faithful, oppose the will of your superiors and even go against the orders of the pope himself and this will happen quite soon..." ...|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Ernest W. Howard of the Women's Patriotic Committee on National Defense castigated the {{slackness}} of Congress for not {{picking up}} on the bill's perceived dangers: [...] "Those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been {{in the study and}} research work of the United Nations, we feel that we are experts in this ... you as Senators with all the many commitments and the many requirements, are not able to go into all these things." [...] John Kaspar, a White Citizens' Council organizer who had achieved notoriety for starting a race riot in Clinton, Tennessee, declared that [...] "almost one hundred percent of all psychiatric therapy is Jewish and about eighty percent of psychiatrists are Jewish ... one particular race is administering this particular thing." [...] He argued that Jews were nationalists of another country who were attempting to [...] "usurp American nationality".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. TV Squad's Jane Boursaw called the episode's case [...] "an interesting premise" [...] and {{was pleased that}} [...] "things are really, REALLY starting to {{come together in a}} big way, which is good, considering that the finale is fast approaching". Annalee Newitz of io9 declared it to be [...] "one of the most rewarding episodes ever for people who love the show's mythology," [...] and found Olivia's universe-hopping ability to be [...] "truly cool". Newitz concluded that [...] "this was a truly awesome episode with a lot of payoff for those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been glued to the set every Tuesday night, looking for answers." [...] The website later listed [...] "The Road Not Taken" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show. Television Without Pity graded the episode with a A-.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 July 2011, Dyke {{wrote in}} the Financial Times that [...] "from the moment it was {{revealed}} that the News of the World had hacked into Milly Dowler's phone, Rupert Murdoch's bid to buy the 60.9 per cent of British Sky Broadcasting that News Corp does not already own was all but over". He admitted, [...] "for those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been warning about the tactics used by the Murdoch operation for many years – Mr Murdoch once described me as 'an enemy' – {{the events of the past}} week have been sweet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Greenwald {{described}} his partner's detention as [...] "clearly intended {{to send a}} message of intimidation to those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been reporting on the NSA and GCHQ". Miranda was detained for nine hours and his laptop and other items were seized. He has since attempted to sue the Metropolitan Police for misuse of their powers. According to The Guardian, the claim, [...] "challenging controversial powers used under schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000, maintains that Miranda was not involved in terrorism and says his right to freedom of expression was curtailed".|$|E

But as all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> toyed with magnets or charged balls well know, their forces (or any other forces for that matter), even when set in motion produce no luminance at all.

Scholars all over the world will have gained from the depth of the critical essays, and so many rights organisations will want to thank him for all the solidarity he gave to the struggles within the republic of conscience.President Higgins also appeared live from Áras an Uachtaráin on the [...] in a five-minute segment in which he paid tribute to Seamus Heaney.|$|E
2500|$|In {{relation}} to non-intersectional feminism in the United States, Lorde famously said, [...] "Those {{of us who}} stand outside the circle of this society's definition of acceptable women; those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been forged in the crucibles of difference -- {{those of us who}} are poor, who are lesbians, who are Black, who are older -- know that survival is not an academic skill. It is learning how to take our differences and make them strengths. For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. And this fact is only threatening to those women who still define the master's house as their only source of support." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Washington Post {{review of}} the book noted, [...] "Prisoners is Jeffrey Goldberg’s sensitive, forthright and {{perceptive}} account of {{his years as a}} soldier and journalist in Israel—and of his long-running conversation with a Palestinian whom he once kept under lock and key. It is a forceful reminder of how rewarding, and how difficult, discourse between Israelis and Palestinians can be.” CBS News critic wrote, [...] "There is no shortage of histories, polemics and policy manuals about the Middle East. An honest but complex story, from what happens to be a personal perspective that many Americans can at least conjure, is a rarer opportunity for insight. And that is what Jeffrey Goldberg, a reporter for The New Yorker, delivers in Prisoners. To those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> followed Jeffrey Goldberg’s reporting on the Muslim world, the publication of his first book is cause for real pleasure...because his writing on the subject has always been exceptional: wise, unpretentious, and at times, unexpectedly funny.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In Congressional {{testimony}} on October 23, 2008, Greenspan {{acknowledged that he}} was [...] "partially" [...] wrong in opposing regulation and stated [...] "Those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder's equity—myself especially—are {{in a state of}} shocked disbelief." [...] Referring to his free-market ideology, Greenspan said: [...] "I have found a flaw. I don't know how significant or permanent it is. But I have been very distressed by that fact." [...] When Representative Henry Waxman (D-CA) pressed him to clarify his words. [...] "In other words, you found that your view of the world, your ideology, was not right, it was not working," [...] Waxman said. [...] "Absolutely, precisely," [...] Greenspan replied. [...] "You know, that's precisely the reason I was shocked, because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well." [...] Greenspan admitted fault in opposing regulation of derivatives and acknowledged that financial institutions didn't protect shareholders and investments as well as he expected.|$|E
2500|$|On August 18, 2013, David Miranda, {{partner of}} {{journalist}} Glenn Greenwald, was detained for nine hours under Schedule 7 of the United Kingdom's Terrorism Act of 2000. Miranda was returning from Berlin, carrying 58,000 GCHQ documents {{on a single}} computer file to Greenwald in Brazil. Greenwald described Miranda's detention as [...] "clearly intended {{to send a message}} of intimidation to those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been reporting on the NSA and GCHQ". The Metropolitan Police and Home Secretary Theresa May called Miranda's detention [...] "legally and procedurally sound". However, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, who helped introduce the bill in the House of Lords, said that under the act, police can only detain someone [...] "to assess whether they are involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism." [...] He said, [...] "I am very clear that this does not apply, either on its terms or in its spirit, to Mr Miranda." [...] Antonio Patriota the Brazilian Minister of External Relations said that Miranda's detention was [...] "not justifiable". The reasons for Miranda's detention were sought from the police by British politicians and David Anderson Q.C., the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation. The United States government later said that British officials had given them a [...] "heads up" [...] about Miranda's detention, while adding that the decision to detain him had been a British one.|$|E

2500|$|According to John Richardson in a 2007 Vanity Fair article, [...] "Jason Epstein's {{assessment}} of Silvers as 'The most brilliant {{editor of a}} magazine ever to have worked in this country' has been 'shared by virtually all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been published by Robert Silvers'". The British newspaper [...] The Guardian called Silvers [...] "the greatest literary editor there has ever been", while Library of America remembered him as [...] "an unsurpassed editor who helped define and sustain the literary and intellectual culture of New York and America". The New York Times described him as [...] "the voracious polymath, the obsessive perfectionist, the slightly unknowable bachelor-workaholic with the colossal Rolodexes and faintly British diction", and, in his obituary, stated that [...] "under his editorship [...] {{became one of the}} premier intellectual journals in the United States, a showcase for extended, thoughtful essays on literature and politics by eminent writers." [...] Author Louis Begley wrote, [...] "the ideal editor of my – and I would guess every writer’s – dreams is ... Robert B. Silvers, the editor, brain, and heart of the NYRB. When I write a piece for his magazine, of course I have the immeasurable good luck to be edited by him. [...] There is no experience quite like it. Bob knows everything that's worth knowing, a consequence of his unflagging curiosity." [...] "Bob's edits are scrupulous, comprehensive, and precise. They are frequently aimed at saving the reviewer's face." [...] Roger Cohen wrote, after Silvers' death, [...] "No eye for imprecise thought was ever more discerning; no edit a sharper yet gentler distillation than his. ... He was a stickler for accuracy. The pencil in his hand went {{to the heart of the}} matter." ...|$|E

[...] It was really felt that Socialism was universal like arithmetic. It was too true for idiom or turn of phrase. In the formula of Karl Marx men could find that frigid fellowship which they find when they agree that two and two make four. It was almost as broadminded as a religious dogma.|$|E

6000|$|The women (angrily {{remembering that}} Mrs. Gallilee had spoken of sending for the police) {{ridiculed}} the footman's cautious proposal--with one exception.
