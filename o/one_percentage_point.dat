The group with the highest support for Strasbourg was the over 35-year-olds with 28 percent support. The citizens of Strasbourg are of course strong supporter's of the Parliament being based in Strasbourg with each session being worth four million euro to the city's economy.

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of Malawian children must {{grow up in the}} absence of one or both birth parents. In all, nearly one-fifth (18 percent) of children aged 0 - 14 years of age are orphans, the highest orphan rate in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. There is also a large group of children, accounting for about 17 percent of total 5 - 14 year-olds, who are fostered, i. e., children who are not orphans but nonetheless live in a separate household from their parents. This Country Brief explores the links between orphanhood, fostering and child vulnerability. Evidence is presented indicating that orphanhood increases child vulnerability on two fronts: it makes it much more likely that a child is denied schooling and much more likely that a child is exposed to the dangers of work. Becoming a single orphan reduces of probability of attending school full-time by 4. 7 <b>percentage</b> <b>points,</b> and increases the probability of attending school in combination with work by about <b>one</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>points.</b> The death of one parent makes it <b>one</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>points</b> more likely that a child works full-time in economic activity and almost 3 <b>percentage</b> <b>points</b> more likely that a children falls into the “inactive” category. Becoming a foster child has even greater effect. The probability of attending school full-time decreases by 5 <b>percentage</b> <b>points</b> and increase by one percent the likelihood that a child will work and by 4 percent the likelihood that a child becomes inactive. On the other hand, becoming a double orphan does not seem significantly influence children’s activity. ...|$|R

By February 2013, he had had to write 14 such letters to chancellors. Between October 2008 and March 2009 the base rate was cut six times to an all-time low of 0.5% {{in order to avoid}} deflation and spur growth. In March 2009, the MPC launched a programme of quantitative easing, initially injecting £75 billion into the economy. By March 2010, it had also increased the amount of money set aside for quantitative easing to £200 billion, a figure later increased by a further £75 billion in the months following October 2011. The MPC announced two further £50 billion rounds of quantitative easing in February and July 2012, bringing the total to £375 billion whilst simultaneously keeping the base rate at 0.5%. In March 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, called on the MPC to follow its American counterpart (the Federal Reserve Board) in committing itself to keeping interest rates low for a prolonged period of time via appropriate forward guidance, which it did on 7 August.|$|E
5|$|Presidential {{elections}} {{were held in}} Croatia {{for the first time}} on 2 August 1992, simultaneously with the 1992 parliamentary elections. Voter turnout was 74.9%. The result was a victory for Franjo Tuđman of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), who received 57.8% of the vote in the first round of the elections, ahead of 7 other candidates. Dražen Budiša, the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) candidate and runner-up in the election, received 22.3% of the vote. The second presidential elections in modern Croatia were held on 15 June 1997. The incumbent, Franjo Tuđman ran opposed by Zdravko Tomac, the candidate of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP), and Vlado Gotovac, nominated by the HSLS. Tomac and Gotovac received 21.0% and 17.6% of votes respectively in the first round of voting, and Tuđman secured another term. The third presidential {{elections were}} held on 24 January 2000, to fill the office of the President of the Republic, after the incumbent Franjo Tuđman died on 10 December 1999. The first round of voting saw Stjepan Mesić, candidate of the Croatian People's Party (HNS) in the lead, receiving 41.3% of votes, followed by Dražen Budiša of the HSLS with 27.8% of votes and Mate Granić, nominated by the HDZ, receiving 22.6% of votes. The runoff election, the first in the presidential elections of modern Croatia, was held on 7 February, when Mesić won, picking up 56.9% of votes. Voter turnout in the first round was 63.0% and 60.9% in the runoff. The first round of the fourth presidential elections was held on 2 January 2005. No candidate secured a first-round victory; however, the incumbent Mesić enjoyed a substantial lead over other candidates, as he received 48.9% of votes, and the second and third ranked candidates Jadranka Kosor (HDZ) and Boris Mikšić (independent) managed only 20.3% and 17.8% of voter support respectively. Ultimately, Mesić won reelection, receiving 65.9% of votes in the runoff held on 16 January. The 2009–2010 presidential election was held on 27 December 2009, with Ivo Josipović (SDP) picking up 32.4% of votes, followed by Milan Bandić (independent), Andrija Hebrang (HDZ) and Nadan Vidošević (independent) receiving 14.8%, 12.0% and 11.3% of the votes respectively. The second round of voting was held on 10 January 2010, when Josipović defeated Bandić, receiving 60.3% of the vote. The first round of the most recent presidential election was held on 28 December 2014, where Josipović won 38.46% of the votes, followed by Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović (HDZ) who received 37.22% of ballots. The third was an independent candidate, Ivan Vilibor Sinčić who received 16.42% of votes, and Milan Kujundžić (Croatian Dawn – Party of the People) who was supported by 6.3% of the votes.

Business tax hikes have no discernible base effects but also no statistically significant effect on revenues. Furthermore, {{the results suggest that}} the tax hikes have no effect on broader economic outcomes such as local employment, firms 4 wage bill, and property prices.

30|$|European tax {{systems in}} general and income and payroll tax systems in {{particular}} are not age-specific, given that the income tax rate relates {{to the level of}} income and not the age of the taxpayer. While there is extensive empirical literature on the relationship between taxes and the individual labour supply decisions 6, there are few empirical findings of tax impacts on the labour supply decision of older workers. The age group that is in transition between employment and retirement is usually excluded from labour supply incentives. The labour income of workers includes decisions of qualification, income level of the industry, hours worked, age, gender, etc., with tax incentives corresponding to the elasticity of the mentioned components. Empirical findings show that working aged women are more responsive to taxes and wages than men. For US employees, Alpert and Powell (2012) find significant effects of payroll taxes on labour exit and pension entries of older workers (55 to 74 year old): the higher the tax burden of older men, the sooner they will quit employment for retirement. The authors suggest that a tax decrease for older workers by <b>one</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>points</b> would decrease labour market exits by 4 %. Age specific deductions of contributions in the social security systems try to reduce labour costs of older workers to promote their labour market attachment.
