5|$|By the 1930s, Glynne's {{focus was}} on cereal diseases, {{especially}} soil-borne varieties. She was able {{to prove that the}} lodging or flattening of wheat close to harvest was frequently not the result of wind or rain, but instead caused by take-all and eyespot, both soil-borne fungal diseases. Glynne was able to not only identify the fungal cause and which strains <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> were less susceptible, but also establish that crop rotation exacerbated the issue. On this basis, she was able to advise which strains <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> should be planted in the affected fields. Glynne also discovered Gibellina cerealis in 1935, a fungal pathogen thought to be introduced to the UK by Roman settlers.|$|E

5|$|Aldermaston {{may have}} been {{inhabited}} as early as 1690 BCE; a number of postholes and remains <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> grains {{have been found in}} the area. Written history of the village is traced back {{at least as far as}} the 9th century CE. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles show that the Ealdorman of Berkshire had his country estate in the village. The manor of Aldermaston was established by the early 11th century, when the village was given to the Achard family by Henry I; the manor is documented in the Domesday survey. The village church was established in the 13th century, and some of the original Norman architecture remains in the building's structure.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{was largely}} forested in this period; {{widespread}} forest clearance {{did not occur}} in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from {{the vicinity of the}} White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith near the river, supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Fanele {{struck the}} country during a series of {{government}} protests, and consequently the national government provided little response to the storm. Instead, United Nations (UN) agencies quickly provided relief to affected citizens. The World Food Programme prepared 87metric tons (MT) <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> and 13MT of various types of pulses. Five United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) trucks arrived in Morondova on January25 with various supplies. In {{the days after the}} storm, contaminated floodwaters resulted in cases of dysentery. To prevent the spread of disease, UNICEF provided vaccines, de-worming tablets, and water cleaning devices. Within three days of the storm's landfall, the agency also began distributing health kits and bed nets. As many schools were affected, UNICEF set up temporary classrooms in tents, while workers began fixing and cleaning the damaged buildings. Despite the quick response by the UN, thousands of people were left without aid. The Malagasy Red Cross deployed its volunteers to affected areas, although disrupted transportation services and the political situation hindered relief efforts.|$|E

5|$|Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, {{all of the}} British Isles came {{to abandon}} its former Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} lifestyle, {{to be replaced by}} the new agricultural subsistence of the Neolithic Age. Although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period, there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement, architectural styles, and the use of natural resources. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic way of life. Although witnessing some land clearance, Britain was largely forested in this period, and it is unclear what level of deforestation the area of Kent had experienced in the Early Neolithic; widespread forest clearance only took place on the chalklands of south-east Britain in the Late Bronze Age. Environmental data from the area around the White Horse Stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{diversity}} is {{an aspect of}} biodiversity important for food security. The loss of bio{{diversity is}} considered one of today’s most serious environmental concerns by the Food and Agriculture Organization. If current trends persist, as many as half of all plant species could face extinction. Among the many threatened species are wild relatives of our crops – the wild and weedy cousins of domesticated plants that possess valuable traits for crop breeding, such as pest and disease resistance. Some 6% of wild relatives <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> crops such as wheat, maize, rice, and sorghum are under threat, as are 18% of legumes (Fabaceae), the wild relatives of beans, peas and lentils, and 13% of species within the botanical family (Solanaceae) that includes potato, tomato, eggplant (aubergine), and peppers (Capsicum). In 2016, 29% of wild relative plant species were completely missing from the world’s genebanks, with a further 24% represented by fewer than 10 samples. Over 70% of all crop wild relative species worldwide were in urgent need of further collecting to improve their representation in genebanks, and over 95% were insufficiently represented with regard to the full range of geographic and ecological variation in their native distributions. While the most critical priorities for further collecting were found in the Mediterranean and Near East, Western and Southern Europe, Southeast and East Asia, and South America, crop wild relatives insufficiently represented in genebanks are distributed across almost all countries worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the impacts}} of Wipha to the already {{severely}} flooded areas of North Korea, the International Red Cross delivered relief supplies to the 2,000 people made homeless by the typhoon. Hundreds of medical clinics which were damaged or destroyed set up makeshift clinics as up to 70 percent of the affected population reported abdominal pains or diarrhea. More than 23,000 volunteers from the Red Cross mobilized to provide quick rehabilitation in the affected regions. By mid-September, €420,000 ($527,000 USD) was provided to repair hospitals and an additional €110,000 ($138,000USD) was planned to be sent. By the end of September, health kits were provided for 300,000 people and an additional $300,000 (USD) was provided for medical supplies in hospitals. From October15 to 18, a Rapid Nutritional Screening of children {{took place in the}} worst affected areas. Eleven hospitals were restocked with medical supplies and a permanent water supply was constructed at the Wonsan general hospital. About $180,000 in aid from Norway was sent to North Korea. By October 22, 2007, 80 percent of the $14.1million pledged in assistance had been funded. About 4,800 tonnes <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> was to be distributed in October as part of the second shipment of food, following the first which was sent prior to Wipha. Funds and materials, worth $166,000 (USD), for revegetation were expected to arrive between December 2007 and February 2008.|$|E

5|$|Mid-March brought warmer air to {{the country}} which thawed the snow lying on the ground. This {{snowmelt}} rapidly ran off the frozen ground into rivers and caused widespread flooding. More than 100,000 properties were affected, and the British Army and foreign aid agencies were required to provide humanitarian aid. With the cold spell over and the ground thawing, there were no further weather problems. The winter had severe effects on British industries, causing the loss of around 10per cent of the year's industrial production, 10to 20per cent <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> and potato crops, and a quarter of sheep stocks. The ruling Labour Party began to lose its popularity, which led to them losing many seats to the Conservative Party in the 1950 election. That winter is also cited {{as a factor in}} the devaluation of the pound from $4.03 to $2.80, Britain's decline from being a superpower, and the introduction of the Marshall Plan to aid war-torn Europe. The effects on the rest of Europe were also severe, with 150 deaths from cold and famine in Berlin, civil disorder in the Netherlands and business closures in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
