40|$|In {{order to}} create sub micron vias between metal layers on silicon IC circuits, the {{tungsten}} filled via processes {{have been in a}} constant state of development over the past 15 years. Processing is complex, expensive, and difficult to reproduce. The introduction of galvanic cells, via undercutting, and exposed plugs are just some of the plagues that have hit several users of the technology. Discussed in this paper is an alternative approach to the complex tungsten filled via interconnect process. The proposed process yields well at sub micron geometries, is easy to perform, and is inexpensive compared to the tungsten filled via process. Contact resistance improves greatly over the standard tungsten process. The test run achieved a mean value of 0. 25 <b>ohms</b> <b>per</b> via compared to historic tungsten process that yields 0. 4 <b>ohms</b> <b>per</b> via.

All ranges could be selected by a single rotary switch which set both the function and the range value.

In addition, a press button has been incorporated which reverses the direction of current through the moving coil, and thus obviates the inconvenience of changing over test leads when the current direction reverses. It also simplifies the testing of potentials, both positive and negative, about a common reference point. A wide range of resistance measurements can be made using internal batteries, separate zero adjustment being provided for each range.
