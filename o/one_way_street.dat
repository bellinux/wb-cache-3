500|$|Neighbours {{was created}} in the early-to-mid-1980s by Australian TV {{executive}} Reg Watson. Watson decided to create a soap opera after working on Crossroads and seeing how successful it and Coronation Street were in Britain. He had already created such successful Australian made soap operas as The Young Doctors, Prisoner and Sons and Daughters. Watson proposed the idea of making a show that would focus on more realistic stories and portray teens and adults who talk openly to each other and solve their problems together. Watson, who worked for the Grundy production company, decided to make his show appeal to both Australia and Britain. In 2005, Darren Devlyn and Caroline Frost from the Herald Sun reported that Watson then took his idea to the Nine Network in 1982, but it was rejected. Former Network Nine chief executive Ian Johnson commented {{that it was one of}} the [...] "biggest missed opportunities" [...] in his twenty-four years at the network. He added [...] "I remember it being discussed, but I'm not exactly sure what went against it. It may have had something to do with the fact we'd picked up Sale of the Century with Tony Barber in 1980 and it was doing huge business, so we didn't have a pressing need for a five-night-a-week show." [...] Watson then took his idea to the Seven Network, who commissioned the show, following the success of his other Seven Network soap opera, Sons and Daughters. Several titles for the show were discussed, including People Like Us, <b>One</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Street,</b> No Through Road and Living Together until the network programmers voted on Neighbours. The first episode was broadcast on 18 March 1985 and reviews for the show were favourable. However, the Melbourne-produced programme underperformed in the Sydney market and after a meeting of the general managers, Seven decided to drop the show in October 1985. Seven's Melbourne programme boss, Gary Fenton said Sydney chief Ted Thomas told the other general managers that Seven could not afford three dramas and argued that the Sydney-based A Country Practice and Sons and Daughters be retained.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{noting the}} {{perception}} that the status debate was not advancing within the PPD, he proposed {{the creation of a new}} party, Partido por la Libre Asociación (lit. [...] "Party for Free Association"), to directly promote free association. The initiative turned into the Partido Acción Civil (lit. [...] "Civil Action Party"), which dropped the status from its platform, aborting the initiative. Ricardo Alegría, a fervent supporter of independence and culture, noted that he would be willing to temporarily support free association in this meant abolishing the territorial clause. Juan Mari Brás, expressed a similar position, claiming that while it is not independence, free association is flexible and [...] "is not a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>street</b> like statehood". In 2002, Julio Muriente of the Movimiento Independentista Nacional Hostosiano (MINH) a moderate pro-independence group, argued that if the free association movement gained prominence within the PPD, it was only a matter of time until the inmovilism surrounding the status debate was vanquished.|$|E

40|$|Sustainability {{reflects}} one of {{the most}} fundamental human desires supported by virtually all philosophies and religions: to create a better future world. Sustainable transport is an essential aspect of developing sustainable cities. Cycling, as a commuter mode of active transportation, is getting increasing attention in cities worldwide due to its environmental and health benefits and its potential to integrate with public transportation. Brisbane City Council is attempting to promote urban cycling as a means of sustainable transport using a public bicycle sharing scheme called CityCycle, which is reputed to be underutilised and performing poorly. Unobtrusive observation of cyclist behaviour in Brisbane’s Central Business District was used to gather primary quantitative data in order to inform the research questions. This was complimented by gathering secondary qualitative data from media sources such as online blogs. This mixed methods research project attempted to find answers to the question why CityCycle was performing poorly and in particular the influence of <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>streets</b> upon cyclists. The first stage of research was to measure the activity of CityCycle station 38 during the AM peak period, as station 38 was deemed to be of strategic importance to the CityCycle network due to its close proximity to Central Station. The second stage of research was to investigate the effects of <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>streets</b> as a deterrent to cyclist participation. Nobody hired a CityCycle from station 38 during the AM peak period on Tuesday 20 August 2013. Also the findings did not back up claims in the planning literature that <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>streets</b> are cycling unfriendly. However, the findings did show the planning cycle is inefficient and the ‘vision-mission-action-measurement’ cycle breaks down at the point of ‘measurement’. Subsequently all recommendations to improve the productivity of CityCycle are based on improvements to the planning framework. It is suggested that there be an investigation into the necessity to maintain commercial sensitivity of the data held by CityCycle in relation to the activity levels of each individual station in the CityCyle network. ...|$|R

5000|$|After {{a certain}} trip modal share {{it may take}} more than just {{installing}} cycle tracks to create large increases in cycle rates. Cycling rates in the Netherlands peaked in the 1960s and dropped dramatically until the mid-1970s. The decline in bicycle use was [...] "not only caused by mass motorization {{but also by the}} related, fairly unco-ordinated process of urbanization and by scores of social, spatial and economic developments", such as a decrease in population density and increased travel distances. The bicycle was almost completely left out of the national government's vision. Certain cities, however, such as Amsterdam and Eindhoven, were slowly implementing more bicycle-positive policies: for example, bike-only streets and allowing cyclists to ignore <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>streets.</b> Throughout the 70s cycling rates increased, but the investments in bike paths made in the subsequent period had less effect. Between the late 1980s and early 1990s the Netherlands spent 1.5 billion guilders (US$945 million) on cycling infrastructure, yet cycling levels stayed practically the same.|$|R
