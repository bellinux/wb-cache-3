50|$|The ASEAN University Network (AUN) is an {{arrangement}} between 30 {{universities in the}} ten ASEAN countries. The AUN is composed of a Board of Trustees (BOT), the participating universities, and the AUN Secretariat. The Board of Trustees consists of one representative {{from each of the}} ASEAN Member Countries, the Secretary-General of ASEAN, the Chairman of the ASEAN subcommittee on Education (ASCOE) and the Executive Director of the AUN. The BOT has the task of formulating policies, approving project proposals, the allocation of budgets and co-ordinating implementation activities. The board makes decisions on these activities on the basis of consensus. The participating universities have the task of implementing the AUN programmes and activities. When AUN was founded in 1995, it consisted of thirteen universities from seven countries. Due to the inclusion of Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia in ASEAN, the network grew to 21 members (for a list of the members, see appendix I). Although numerous applications for membership have been received, it was decided to only admit universities from the new member countries. Non members from the region however, are invited as observers on a regular basis. The AUN Secretariat is involved in the planning, organisation, monitoring and evaluation of AUN activities and also in the development of new ideas and the acquisition of funding. The permanent <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretariat</b> was established in 2000 and is located on the campus of Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. The operating costs of the secretariat are (at least until 2005) allocated by the Thai Government.|$|E
40|$|Rooted in culture, taro is both eaten and exalted in the Pacific, and dished {{up in the}} Caribbean and Africa too. Is {{its future}} {{precarious}} or promising? If you were a taro an oval tuber of 1 to 3 kg and under-flowing with confidence, you might well think {{that the world was}} trying to talk you into believing that you had a serious personality disorder. On the one hand, at least in the Pacific, you are revered by all the people you grow amongst. When you are served up at mealtimes, everyone present is bound to cease whatever hostilities they were pursuing. You feature in traditional medicine and on coins in Samoa and Tonga; you might end up on a national flag one day. You rank 14 th worldwide among staple crops. In Hawaii, you are so important that only men may grow you. In Cameroon, where the women do the growing and the cooking, you are the centre of a complex serving ritual, and are used as a way to catch your man. Something for everyone. But. You are on the list of the world s most under-utilised crops though you could regard that more as a challenge than a put-me-down. Your starchy flesh is toxic, to an irritating level, unless well cooked. You are perishable and store for a week, no more. You are susceptible to leaf blight, and to removal from entire nations fields and plates if resistance is not improved. Some people regard you as poor people s food. And after a brief flirtation in the 1990 s with the yuppie markets in Europe and North America, only the ethnic and diaspora markets stay true to you. More than meets the eye Chin up, taro, it s time, quite literally, to turn a new leaf. A root crop, Colocasia esculenta originated in Asia where it is widely known as taro a name that has spread across the world. Normally small and round, the Caribbean variety is longer, known as dasheen, from the French chou de chine, or Chinese cabbage, and the tubers are known as as eddo or malanga. As a member of the calla lily family, its leaves are cooked as greens; when served as callaloo in Trinidad or Jamaica, it attains the worship-level of a national dish. In West Africa, where the tubers are mashed with cassava as fufu, it is a staple in Cameroon, Ghana, Guinea and Nigeria. It shares the name cocoyam with its relation Xanthosoma spp also known as macabo or tannia. Grown in 30 countries, either in flooded wetlands or in uplands, the bulk of taro production is in Africa. Nigeria accounts for almost half of the world s production of 8. 5 million t. Other major producers in sub-Saharan Africa are Ghana, Côte d Ivoire, Madagascar and the Central African Republic. After Africa comes Asia, where China is the main producer, followed by Japan, the Philippines and Thailand. The heart of the diet With production at 300, 000 t, Oceania is outshone by all other regions except the Caribbean but only in volume. For the general shine of taro is brightest right here among the nations and territories of the Pacific. Says FAO, 'no other part of the world can match Oceania in terms of the intensity of production, utilisation and dependence on taro for food'. In Tonga, where tubers represent almost half the nation s intake of dietary calories, about 40 % of them come from taro. In Solomon Islands, about 10 % of people s dietary calories come from taro, 30 % from other tubers. It is in Samoa that the central role of taro is best expressed. Prior to a devastating spread of taro leaf blight in 1993, virtually all the population s dietary intake from tubers (one-fifth of the overall diet) came from taro. The overnight removal of taro from household menus, and the prohibition of even modest exports to Samoans in Australia, New Zealand and California, was a great shock to the nation s psyche, diet and economy in short, to its identity. That shock made many Pacific nations realise their vulnerability to leaf blight, and to re-focus on a crop that they had perhaps taken for granted. Given its sometimes spiritual attributes, one observer mused, maybe taro was a Pacific person s tenth chakra a person s hub of energy. In healthy moderation After the blight, the new impulse. Through the TaroGen programme, set up in 1998 at the Fiji <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretariat</b> of the Pacific Community, advances {{have been made in the}} management, deployment and use of genetic diversity. The crop has bounced back in Samoa after farmers planted specially-bred disease-resistant varieties. Although more research is needed to maintain diversity and resistance, it must be accompanied by improved availability of resistant planting materials and seeds as much a question of organisation as research breakthroughs. Researchers are now focussing on DNA fingerprinting of taro varieties for the accurate comparison of accessions between countries. Another focus is on virus indexing procedures, to overcome quarantine concerns in international exchanges of taro germplasm. The establishment and maintenance of genebanks for in vitro storage remains a priority, but more attention is now going to seed storage systems and on-farm conservation. According to TaroGen, this will 'involve farming communities in research and development and combine social, biological and agroecological aspects involved in taro cultivation'. This perennial issue of good understanding between farmer and researcher is high on the agenda of the Third Taro Symposium, scheduled for late May 2003 in Fiji. But in a world of changing tastes, can taro become a more tradable commodity as well as being a cultural icon and an essential part of the diet of many Pacific nations? Improvements in quality, standards, marketing, new products, industrial processing techniques and storage will all help to pull one of the most ancient of crops into a new era, without pulling out its roots. Chips, powders, flours, cakes, biscuits, ice-creams banal enough, but power food in a way. Power for a people. Power for a plant.
