5|$|Metformin {{appears to}} be safe and {{effective}} to counteract the weight gain caused by antipsychotic drugs <b>olanzapine</b> and clozapine. Although modest reversal of clozapine-associated weight gain is found with metformin, primary prevention of weight gain is more valuable.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people on}} {{antipsychotics}} have side effects. People on typical antipsychotics {{tend to have}} a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects, while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with <b>olanzapine,</b> while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain. Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol. It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious neurological disorder.|$|E
5|$|Nonbenzodiazepines are {{contraindicated}} during benzodiazepine withdrawal as {{they are}} cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence. Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another. During withdrawal, fluoroquinolone-based antibiotics are best avoided if possible; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and, thus, may aggravate withdrawal symptoms. Antipsychotics are not recommended for benzodiazepine withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially clozapine, <b>olanzapine</b> or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with <b>olanzapine,</b> which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E
5|$|No {{medications}} directly {{treat the}} core symptoms of AS. Although {{research into the}} efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for AS is limited, {{it is essential to}} diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with AS to see why medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, inattention and aggression. The atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone and <b>olanzapine</b> have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; risperidone can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline have been effective in treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.|$|E
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as <b>olanzapine.</b> Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E
25|$|Several patient {{groups are}} at a {{heightened}} risk of side effects from <b>olanzapine</b> and antipsychotics in general. <b>Olanzapine</b> may produce non-trivial high blood sugar in people with diabetes mellitus. Likewise, the elderly {{are at a}} greater risk of falls and accidental injury. Young males appear to be at heightened risk of dystonic reactions, although these are relatively rare with <b>olanzapine.</b> Most antipsychotics, including <b>olanzapine,</b> may disrupt the body's natural thermoregulatory systems, thus permitting excursions to dangerous levels when situations (exposure to heat, strenuous exercise) occur.|$|E
25|$|Despite weight gain, a large multi-center {{randomized}} National Institute of Mental Health {{study found}} that <b>olanzapine</b> was better at controlling symptoms because patients {{were more likely to}} remain on <b>olanzapine</b> than the other drugs. One small, open-label, non-randomized study suggests that taking <b>olanzapine</b> by orally dissolving tablets may induce less weight gain, but this has not been substantiated in a blinded experimental setting.|$|E
25|$|The Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) {{recommends}} <b>olanzapine</b> as a {{first line}} maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder and the combination of <b>olanzapine</b> with fluoxetine as second line treatment for bipolar depression.|$|E
25|$|<b>Olanzapine</b> is {{associated}} with the highest placental exposure of any atypical antipsychotic. Despite this, the available evidence suggests it is safe during pregnancy, although the evidence is insufficiently strong to say anything {{with a high degree of}} confidence. <b>Olanzapine</b> {{is associated}} with weight gain which according to recent studies may put olanzapine-treated patients' offspring at a heightened risk for neural tube defects (e.g. spina bifida). Breastfeeding in women taking <b>olanzapine</b> is advised against due to the fact that <b>olanzapine</b> is secreted in breast milk with one study finding that the exposure to the infant (in mg per kg of body weight, that is) is about 1.8% that to the mother.|$|E
25|$|The {{first-line}} {{psychiatric treatment}} for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication which includes <b>olanzapine.</b> <b>Olanzapine</b> appears {{effective in reducing}} symptoms of schizophrenia, treating acute exacerbations, and treating early-onset schizophrenia. The usefulness of maintenance therapy, however, {{is difficult to determine}} as more than half of people in trials quit before the six-week completion date. <b>Olanzapine</b> treatment may result in increased weight gain and increased glucose and cholesterol levels when compared to most other second-generation antipsychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia, other than clozapine.|$|E
25|$|Direct glucuronidation and {{cytochrome}} P450 mediated oxidation are {{the primary}} metabolic pathways for <b>olanzapine.</b> In vitro studies suggest that CYPs 1A2 and 2D6, and the flavin-containing monooxygenase system are involved in <b>olanzapine</b> oxidation. CYP2D6 mediated oxidation {{appears to be a}} minor metabolic pathway in vivo.|$|E
25|$|<b>Olanzapine</b> has {{not been}} rigorously {{evaluated}} in generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, delusional parasitosis or post-traumatic stress disorder. <b>Olanzapine</b> is no less effective than lithium or valproate, and more effective than placebo in treating bipolar disorder. It has also been used for Tourette syndrome and stuttering.|$|E
25|$|<b>Olanzapine</b> is used therapeutically {{to treat}} serious mental illness. Occasionally {{it can have}} the {{opposite}} effect and provoke serious paradoxical reactions in a small subgroup of people, causing unusual changes in personality, thoughts or behavior; hallucinations and excessive thoughts about suicide have also been linked to <b>olanzapine</b> use.|$|E
25|$|Schizophrenia: {{antipsychotics}} such as haloperidol, clozapine, <b>olanzapine,</b> risperidone and quetiapine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Olanzapine</b> is generic and is {{available}} under many trade names worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{does not}} support the use of {{atypical}} antipsychotics including <b>olanzapine</b> in eating disorders.|$|E
25|$|<b>Olanzapine</b> has {{a higher}} {{affinity}} for 5-HT2A serotonin receptors than D2 dopamine receptors, which is a common property of most atypical antipsychotics, aside from the benzamide antipsychotics such as amisulpride along with the non-benzamides aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, blonanserin, cariprazine, melperone and perospirone. <b>Olanzapine</b> also had the highest affinity of any second-generation antipsychotic towards the P-glycoprotein in one in vitro study. P-glycoprotein transports a myriad of drugs across a numerous of different biological membranes (found in numerous body systems) including the blood-brain barrier (a semi-permeable membrane which filters the contents of blood prior to it reaching the brain); P-GP inhibition could mean that less brain exposure to <b>olanzapine</b> results from this interaction with the P-glycoprotein. A relatively large quantity of commonly encountered foods and medications inhibit P-GP, and it is fairly common for pharmaceuticals to be either substrates of P-GP, or to inhibit its action; both substrates and inhibitors of P-GP effectively increase the permeability of the blood brain barrier to P-GP substrates and subsequently increase the central activity of the substrate while reducing the local effects on the GI tract. The mediation of <b>olanzapine</b> in {{the central nervous system}} by P-GP means that any other substance or drug which interacts with P-GP increases the risk for toxic accumulations of both <b>olanzapine</b> and the other drug.|$|E
25|$|Bipolar disorder: lithium carbonate, {{antipsychotics}} (like <b>olanzapine</b> or quetiapine), anticonvulsants (like valproic acid, lamotrigine and topiramate).|$|E
25|$|<b>Olanzapine</b> is {{a potent}} {{antagonist}} of the muscarinic M3 receptor, which may underlie its diabetogenic side effects.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, <b>olanzapine</b> also {{exhibits}} {{a relatively low}} affinity for serotonin 5-HT1, GABAA, beta-adrenergic receptors, and benzodiazepine binding sites.|$|E
25|$|<b>Olanzapine</b> is metabolized by the {{cytochrome}} P450 system; principally by isozyme 1A2 and to {{a lesser}} extent by 2D6. By these mechanisms more than 40% of the oral dose, on average, is removed by the hepatic first-pass effect. Drugs or agents that increase the activity of CYP1A2, notably tobacco smoke, may significantly increase hepatic first-pass clearance of Olanzapine; conversely, drugs which inhibit 1A2 activity (examples: Ciprofloxacin, Fluvoxamine) may reduce <b>Olanzapine</b> clearance.|$|E
25|$|An {{antipsychotic}} {{combined with}} an antidepressant, particularly atypical antipsychotics such as aripiprazole (Abilify), quetiapine (Seroquel), <b>olanzapine</b> (Zyprexa), and risperidone (Risperdal).|$|E
25|$|<b>Olanzapine</b> (originally branded Zyprexa) is an {{antipsychotic}} medication used {{to treat}} schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It is usually classed with the atypical antipsychotics, the newer generation of antipsychotics. It appears to have slightly greater effectiveness in treating schizophrenia (especially the negative symptoms) and a lower risk of causing movement disorders than typical antipsychotics. <b>Olanzapine,</b> however, has {{a higher risk of}} causing metabolic side effects like weight gain and type 2 diabetes than the typical antipsychotics.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 meta {{analysis}} concluded that <b>olanzapine</b> plus fluoxetine {{was the most}} effective among nine treatments for bipolar depression included in the analysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Olanzapine</b> is {{believed}} to work by blocking, or antagonizing, the dopamine D2 receptor which is an action it shares with most antipsychotics. Like most other atypical antipsychotics <b>olanzapine</b> also strongly antagonizes the 5-HT2A receptor, which may partially underpin its reduced propensity for causing movement disorders. Despite its close structural relation to traditional benzodiazepine anxiety-relieving medications, it possesses no affinity for the GABAA receptor, its anxiety-relieving effect is mediated through its effect on dopamine and 5-HT receptors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Olanzapine</b> is {{considered}} moderately toxic in overdose; more toxic than quetiapine, aripiprazole and the SSRIs and less toxic than the MAOIs and TCAs.|$|E
25|$|Citing an {{increased}} risk of stroke, in 2004 the Committee on the Safety of Medicines (CSM) in the UK issued a warning that <b>olanzapine</b> and risperidone, both atypical antipsychotic medications, should not be given to elderly patients with dementia. In the U.S., <b>olanzapine</b> comes with a black box warning for increased risk of death in elderly patients. It is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis. However, a BBC investigation in June 2008 found that this advice was being widely ignored by British doctors.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{side effect}} of <b>olanzapine</b> is weight gain, which may be profound in some cases and/or associated with derangement in the blood lipid and blood sugar profiles (see section metabolic effects). A recent meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerance of 15 antipsychotic drugs (APDs) found that it had the highest propensity for causing weight gain out of the 15 APD compared with a SMD of 0.74 Extrapyramidal side effects, although potentially serious, are infrequent to rare from <b>olanzapine</b> but may include tremors and muscle rigidity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Olanzapine</b> {{was first}} {{patented}} in 1971. The drug became generic in 2011. Sales of Zyprexa in 2008 were $2.2 {{billion in the}} US, and $4.7 billion worldwide.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 meta {{analysis}} of 9 published trials having minimum duration 6 months and median duration 52 weeks concluded that <b>olanzapine,</b> quetiapine, and risperidone had better effects on cognitive function than amisulpride and haloperidol.|$|E
25|$|Atypical {{antipsychotic}} {{drugs like}} clozapine, <b>olanzapine,</b> quetiapine, risperidone and asenapine are relatively potent antagonists of 5-HT2A as {{are some of}} the lower potency old generation/typical antipsychotics. Other antagonists are MDL-100,907 (prototype of another new series of 5-HT2A antagonists) and cyproheptadine.|$|E
25|$|Only aripiprazole, <b>olanzapine,</b> and {{quetiapine}} have specifically {{been approved}} for MDD by the FDA in the United States. Quetiapine and lurasidone have been approved, as monotherapies, for bipolar depression, but as of present, lurasidone has not {{been approved for}} MDD.|$|E
25|$|Macaque monkeys {{administered}} {{with the}} antipsychotics haloperidol and <b>olanzapine</b> over a 17–27 month period showed reduced brain volume. These results {{have not been}} observed in humans who also take the drug {{due to the lack}} of available data.|$|E
25|$|National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the British Association for Psychopharmacology, and the World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry {{suggest that}} there is little {{difference}} in effectiveness between antipsychotics in prevention of relapse, and recommend that the specific choice of antipsychotic be chosen based on persons preference and side effect profile. The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concludes that <b>olanzapine</b> is not different from haloperidol in the treatment of positive symptoms and general psychopathology, or in overall assessment, but that it is superior for the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms. When trials enrolling only treatment-resistant patients were excluded from the analysis, <b>olanzapine</b> was superior for overall assessment.|$|E
25|$|Antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, are {{sometimes}} used {{in addition to}} benzodiazepines to control agitation or psychosis. Antipsychotics may potentially worsen alcohol withdrawal as they lower the seizure threshold. Clozapine, <b>olanzapine,</b> or low-potency phenothiazines (such as chlorpromazine) are particularly risky; if used, extreme caution is required.|$|E
