6000|$|We now {{reach the}} myths of Heitsi Eibib and Tsui |Goab {{collected}} by Dr. Hahn himself.

[...] "We Khoi-Khoi always, if we are in trouble, go and pray at the graves of <b>our</b> <b>grandparents</b> and ancestors." [...] They also sing rude epic verses, accompanied by the dance in honour of men distinguished in the late Namaqua and Damara war. Now it is alleged by Dr. Hahn that prayers are offered at the graves of Heitsi Eibib and Tsui Goab, as at those of ancestors lately dead, and Heitsi Eibib and Tsui Goab within living memory were honoured by song and dance, exactly like the braves of the Damara war.|$|E

40|$|What is innovation? How {{important}} is innovation in business? How can {{we use it}} to succeed? In the last 150 years our world has been transformed [...] largely due to innovation. Our parents were born into a world where television {{had yet to be}} invented, and there was no penicillin or frozen food. <b>Our</b> great <b>grandparents</b> began life in a world with no light bulbs, cars, telephones, or airplanes. This Very Short Introduction looks at what innovation is and why it can affect us so profoundly. It examines how it occurs, who stimulates it, how it is pursued, and what its outcomes are, both positive and negative. The book shows that innovation is hugely challenging and failure is common, yet it is essential to our social and economic progress. Mark Dodgson and David Gann also consider the extent to which our understanding of innovation has developed over the past century and how it might be used to interpret the global economy we all face in the future...|$|R

The critic from the Sydney Morning Herald stated that: Mr Spencer has now produced several Australian taken and manufactured pictures, all of which have been of highest class, but it is questionable if he has done anything better than his latest effort. From the first scene to the last the pictures are good, the flicker being reduced to a minimum... Set among charming old-world scenery with the quaint costumes of <b>our</b> great <b>grandparents</b> the opening scene of the May-day dance is a jewel picture, and the promise of the opening scene is fulfilled throughout. The cliff and water scenery one can safely say, has never been surpassed in Australian picture shows. Through all her varying tones, from peaceful home in England to happiness in Australia, Margaret is charming, and carries the sympathy of the audience with her. Last in the cast of characters, but far from last in the hearts of the audience, are the splendid horses that play so important a part in the story.|$|R

6000|$|The violet, again, is {{a greatly}} overrated exemplar.

But, withal, the {{fragrance}} is as far-reaching as any I know. It droops ingenuously. [...] "How could {{you come to}} me," [...] it seems to say, [...] "when all these really brilliant flowers invite you?" [...] Mere fishing for compliments.

Then it comes, too, in early spring, without a chaperon, and catches our hearts fresh before they are jaded with the crowded beauties of May. A really modest flower would wait for the other flowers to come first. A subtle affectation is surely a different thing from modesty. The violet is simply artful, the young widow among flowers, and to hold up such a flower as an example is not doing one's duty by the young. For true modesty commend me to the agave, which flowers once only in half a hundred years, as one may see for oneself at the Royal Botanical Gardens.|$|R

Our parents did not understand us, and we struggle to understand why our children would prefer to spend hours on interactive video games instead of kicking a football in the park. Our world is very different today from the world of <b>our</b> parents, <b>grandparents</b> and their parents, so it stands to reason that generations will adapt to a different world as well as influence the progress of the world.

In the workplace, tension often mounts as managers and co-workers are confronted by alien views of the world of work from a generation raised on technology and excesses.

To solve the endogeneity problem, we use a unique survey on households with twin children and a comparison group of non-twin households.

Using twinning as a natural experiment, we do not find evidence on {{the negative effects of}} fertility on parental labor supply. By contrast, we find that the twinning-induced increase in fertility enhances significantly the coresidence of grandparents. The results remain robust when we use the Chinese 1990 population census. We suggest that the negative effects of fertility on parental labor supply are mitigated by the childcare provided by <b>grandparents.</b> <b>Our</b> results have important implications for population and public childcare policies...|$|R

This first important recognition on the international scene created a useful tie with the Dutch music scene and {{laid the foundation for}} further commissions. Meanwhile, in Italy, thanks to a commission from the Teatro Lirico di Cagliari, Francesconi had the opportunity to seriously put into practice for the first time his idea of a [...] "polyphony of languages": Suite 1984. The polyphony that I have in mind hasn't got {{anything to do with the}} [...] "postmodern" [...] or collage, the exotic pastiche, the provincial chinoiserie of <b>our</b> <b>grandparents</b> (but also of Stockhausen and certain pop groups). Instead, it is a free fusion of ideas in a compact and linguistically very solid body that reveals its profound energies in its inner profundity and not in an exterior heterogeneity. Energies that come from the earth, from popular culture, from ancient African and Oriental cultures."In 1984 the Teatro Lirico in Cagliari presented a quartet made up of the pianist and composer Franco D'Andrea together with the group Africa Djolé led by the master percussionist Fode Youla from Guinea. The idea was then conceived that the music of this group be recreated in symphonic form (Suite 1984) by the 28 year-old Luca Francesconi for a performance by the theatre's orchestra under the direction of Francesconi himself, a recent product of rigorous musical studies, assistant to Luciano Berio and 'jazz student of D'Andrea', as he used to like to define himself. The concert attracted experts from all over the place anxious to hear novelties and promising syncretisms of various musical civilisations, and it was a triumph." [...] "Orchestra, African percussionists and jazz quintet: the choice of instrumental make-up itself contained in an explicit manner the generative nucleus of one of the principal aesthetic motors of the music of Luca Francesconi: the tendency to place alongside one another, following the rules of contrast and fusion, sounds and languages of highly diverse origins." ...|$|E
