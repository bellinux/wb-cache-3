500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1947, Bakshi's father and uncle {{traveled}} to Washington, D.C., in search of business opportunities, and soon moved the family to the black neighborhood of Foggy Bottom. Bakshi recalled, [...] "All my friends were black, everyone we did business with was black, the school across the street was black. It was segregated, so everything was black. I went to see black movies; black girls sat <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b> I went to black parties. I was another black kid on the block. No problem!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The San Francisco pop-punk Band J Church's 1994 song [...] "Hate So Real" [...] is a first-person {{tale of the}} murders, {{including}} the names {{of several of the}} victims and the line [...] "Now Caril can't deny me/ and to this day I swear/ she should be sittin' <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap</b> when I go to the chair." [...] Also, their song [...] "In Vain" [...] from their 1993 release Yellow, Blue and Green features themes from the Starkweather/Fugate saga and pictures of the two featured in the artwork.|$|E

5000|$|The title {{refers to}} her film 'addiction'. [...] "I got hooked on movies {{at an early}} age, (around 4 or 5 , when I saw them while sitting <b>on</b> <b>my</b> parents' <b>laps),</b> and I am still a child before a moving image. Movies seem to me the most mysteriously great of all art forms." ...|$|R
60|$|It was on {{this very}} first day that I had the misfortune to throw her, though she was not subject to such {{weakness}} in general, {{into a state of}} violent consternation. I came into the room where she and my mother were sitting; and the baby (who was only a few weeks old) being <b>on</b> <b>my</b> mother's <b>lap,</b> I took it very carefully in my arms. Suddenly Miss Murdstone gave such a scream that I all but dropped it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well, never mind," [...] she said. [...] "You needn't. I've {{got some}} picture books {{for you to}} look at. Come and sit <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> and we'll look at them together." ...|$|E

60|$|Holding my valise <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> I {{settled back}} in the seat again, but not to sleep. The little {{adventure}} had aroused me thoroughly. Mr. Allen Price sat beside me {{for a few moments}} in silence.|$|E
60|$|The child {{advanced}} promptly. Relieved of her wrapping, {{she appeared}} exceedingly tiny; {{but was a}} neat, completely-fashioned little figure, light, slight, and straight. Seated <b>on</b> <b>my</b> godmother's ample <b>lap,</b> she looked a mere doll; her neck, delicate as wax, her head of silky curls, increased, I thought, the resemblance.|$|R
5000|$|Walker {{was born}} in Stockton, California in 1969. She lived with her father, Larry Walker (b. 1935), {{who worked as a}} painter and professor. Her mother Gwendolyn worked as an {{administrative}} assistant. Reflecting on her father's influence, Walker recalls: “One of my earliest memories involves sitting <b>on</b> <b>my</b> dad’s <b>lap</b> in his studio in the garage of our house and watching him draw. I remember thinking: ‘I want to do that, too,’ and I pretty much decided then and there at age 2½ or 3 that I was an artist just like Dad.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The win tied Johnson with Dale Earnhardt for seventh on NASCAR's all-time wins list. He said {{in victory}} lane {{that it was}} [...] "such an honor. With the chaos at the end, with the crash and the {{overtime}} and how it works these days, I kind of lost sight of that. I remembered <b>on</b> <b>my</b> victory <b>lap,</b> and I had {{to come down and}} throw a 3 out the window to pay respects to the man. There's a huge void in my career that I was never able to race with him, but at least I was able to tie his record there." ...|$|R
6000|$|We did put {{him down}} on the floor--there was no other place--with his head <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> and I found strange voices asking him what Perrault had done to him. [...] "Oh! nothing! 'twasn't that. Yes, he's gone, out by the window." ...|$|E
60|$|Yet I {{have promised}} and must keep my word. So sit down here {{at my feet}} and rest your bright head <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> that I may not see in your young eyes the shadows my story will bring across their bonny blue.|$|E
6000|$|... "Put {{your head}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> and I'll cover {{you up with}} my apron; I'm {{not afraid of the}} night," [...] said Nan, sitting down and trying to persuade herself that she did not mind the shadow nor the mysterious rustlings all about her.|$|E
50|$|The {{daughter}} of Hadi Khorsandi, {{she was born}} in Iran and says her earliest memory is 'riding on a bicycle in Tehran, <b>on</b> <b>my</b> uncle’s <b>lap</b> at dawn, to get chocolate milk'. She and her family were forced to flee from Iran to London after the Islamic Revolution following the publication of a satirical poem her father composed. The poem was seen as critical of the revolutionary regime. Khorsandi was raised without any religion, and identifies as an atheist and a humanist. She later became a Patron of the British Humanist Association, which appointed her as its President from January 2016, succeeding Jim Al-Khalili.|$|R
5000|$|The team still hadn't made {{a proper}} seat for me, so I {{had taken a}} beating inside the cockpit, but I kept my foot down and desperately tried to {{remember}} where the next corner was. I knew the tunnel was taken flat out <b>on</b> <b>my</b> first <b>lap</b> but as I came back into daylight at 170mph, I was being bounced around so badly, I had double vision and I vividly remember speeding toward the tyre barrier wondering if I should turn left or right. Anyway I was called back to the pits {{and that was my}} run for the day. Perry McCarthysums up his Monaco pre-qualifying session.|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR FRIEND,--To-day is {{as hot as}} it {{has been}} in the sun; and as I was a little tired and seedy, I went down and just drank in sunshine. A strong wind has risen out of the west; the great big dead leaves from the {{roadside}} planes scuttled about and chased one another over the gravel round me with a noise like little waves under the keel of a boat, and jumped up sometimes <b>on</b> to <b>my</b> <b>lap</b> and into <b>my</b> face. I lay down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back at last, and looked up into the sky. The white corner of the hotel, with a wide projection at the top, stood out in dazzling relief; and there was nothing else, save a few of the plane leaves that had got up wonderfully high and turned and eddied and flew here and there like little pieces of gold leaf, to break the extraordinary sea of blue. It was bluer than anything in the world here; wonderfully blue, and looking deeply peaceful, although in truth there was a high wind blowing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't," [...] said Phil, {{sitting down}} comfortably {{to wait for}} her escort. [...] "Joseph, you calico beastie, don't you dare jump <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b> I won't go to a dance all over cat hairs. No, Anne, I WON'T look matronly. But no doubt I'll be married." ...|$|E
60|$|Possum, the fox-terrier puppy Galbraith had so inconsiderately foisted upon me, whimpered {{and shivered}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap</b> inside my {{greatcoat}} {{and under the}} fur robe. But he would not settle down. Continually he whimpered and clawed and struggled to get out. And, once out and bitten by the cold, with equal insistence he whimpered and clawed to get back.|$|E
60|$|We both laughed, {{though the}} Doctor {{was on his}} way to the dead-house and I held a shroud <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b> But in a {{hospital}} one learns that cheerfulness is one's salvation; for, in an atmosphere of suffering and death, heaviness of heart would soon paralyze usefulness of hand, if the blessed gift of smiles had been denied us.|$|E
6000|$|SHE {{was sitting}} alone in the dim light, with the bandage over her eyes, with her pretty hands crossed patiently <b>on</b> her <b>lap.</b> <b>My</b> heart swelled in me as I looked at her, and felt the horrid {{discovery}} that I had made still present in my mind. [...] "Forgive me for leaving you," [...] I said in as steady a voice as I could command at the moment--and kissed her.|$|R
6000|$|I forgot {{even the}} dainty dressing-jacket <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back. [...] "Miss Bowater {{is pleased to}} be satirical," [...] I said, my hand clenched in <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|R

60|$|How long I sat petrified, {{with the}} {{document}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> I never knew. Somebody {{knocked at the}} schoolroom door, and looked in and said something, and went out again. Then there was an interval. Then the door was opened again. A hand was laid kindly on my shoulder. I looked up--and there was Mrs. Fosdyke, asking, in the greatest alarm, {{what was the matter}} with me.|$|E
60|$|Trembling and breathless, I {{ran up the}} stairs, the {{two gentlemen}} {{following}} me. The address of the letter was in my husband's handwriting. My heart sank in me as I looked at the lines; there could be but one reason for his writing to me. That closed envelope held his farewell words. I sat with the letter <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> stupefied, incapable of opening it.|$|E
60|$|We {{were busy}} with Peepy, {{taking off his}} {{clerical}} hat, asking him if he remembered us, and so on. Peepy retired behind his elbow at first, but relented {{at the sight of}} sponge-cake and allowed me to take him <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> where he sat munching quietly. Mr. Jarndyce then withdrawing into the temporary growlery, Miss Jellyby opened a conversation with her usual abruptness.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And <b>my</b> <b>lap</b> full of seventy times seven bundles! Why not bid him sit <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knee, Shameless? But men {{are ever}} thus!' She looked round for approval. An Amritzar courtesan {{near the window}} sniffed behind her head drapery.|$|R
50|$|The child {{testified in}} court {{regarding}} the abuse she had suffered, and afterward - on April 10, 1874 - she said: My {{father and mother}} are both dead. I don’t know how old I am. I have no recollection {{of a time when}} I did not live with the Connollys. Mamma has been in the habit of whipping and beating me almost every day. She used to whip me with a twisted whip—a rawhide. The whip always left a black and blue mark <b>on</b> <b>my</b> body. I have now the black and blue marks <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head which were made by mamma, and also a cut {{on the left side of}} my forehead which was made by a pair of scissors. She struck me with the scissors and cut me; I have no recollection of ever having been kissed by any one—have never been kissed by mamma. I have never been taken <b>on</b> <b>my</b> mamma's <b>lap</b> and caressed or petted. I never dared to speak to anybody, because if I did I would get whipped. I do not know for what I was whipped—mamma never said anything to me when she whipped me. I do not want to go back to live with mamma, because she beats me so. I have no recollection ever being on the street in my life. Mrs. Connolly was sentenced to jail for one year. That year the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children was founded, the first organization of its kind.|$|R

She tenderly kissed the child, and then she put it <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b> 'There is my only comfort,' she said, simply; 'and there is the obstacle to my ever becoming Mr. Germaine's wife.'" ...|$|E
60|$|The chair {{returned}} to us more slowly. Miserrimus Dexter was working {{it with one}} hand only. In the other he held a harp of a pattern which I had hitherto only seen in pictures. The strings were few in number, and the instrument was so small that I could have held it easily <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b> It was the ancient harp of the pictured Muses and the legendary Welsh bards.|$|E
60|$|Having {{given that}} explanation, he seated himself by Rachel. I retired {{modestly}} to a corner--with Miss Jane Ann Stamper <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> {{in case of}} emergency. My aunt sat at the window; placidly fanning herself as usual. Mr. Ablewhite stood {{up in the middle}} of the room, with his bald head much pinker than I had ever seen it yet, and addressed himself in the most affectionate manner to his niece.|$|E
