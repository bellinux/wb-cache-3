25|$|The {{number of}} murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great; we can form only an approximative {{estimate}} {{of what is}} going on in those parts of the South which are not closely garrisoned, and from which no regular reports are received, by what occurs under the very eyes <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>military</b> authorities. As to my personal experience, I will only mention that during my two days sojourn at Atlanta, one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom died. While I was at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with their lives. Several papers attached to this report give an account of the number of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain period of time. It is a sad fact that the perpetration of those acts is not confined to that class of people which might be called the rabble.|$|E

500|$|IGN {{commented that}} the {{portrayal}} of [...] "service in the military is a hilarious satire of the current state <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>military</b> in Iraq". Iverson was also impressed with the episode's random flashback gags, commenting that [...] "normally they are only groan-worthy," [...] receiving a final rating of 9/10. Brett Love of TV Squad noted that [...] "The Full Metal Jacket/Stripes angle for Stewie and Brian was great, {{right down to the}} Stripes music during the obstacle course.

500|$|Cameron {{said that}} Americans have a [...] "moral responsibility" [...] to {{understand}} {{the impact of their}} country's recent military campaigns. [...] Commenting on the term [...] "shock and awe" [...] in the film, Cameron said: [...] "We {{know what it feels like}} to launch the missiles. [...] We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America." [...] Christian Hamaker of Crosswalk.com noted that, [...] "in describing the military assault on Pandora, Cameron cribs terminology from the ongoing war on terrorism and puts it in the mouths of the film's villains... as they 'fight terror with terror'. Cameron's sympathies, and the movie's, clearly are with the Na'vi—and against the military and corporate men." [...] A columnist in the Russian newspaper Vedomosti traced Avatars popularity to its giving the audience a chance to make a moral choice between good and evil and, by emotionally siding with Jake's treason, to relieve [...] "us the scoundrels" [...] of our collective guilt for the cruel and unjust world that we have created. Armond White of New York Press dismissed the film as [...] "essentially a sentimental cartoon with a pacifist, naturalist message" [...] that uses villainous Americans to misrepresent the facts of the military, capitalism, and imperialism. [...] Answering critiques of the film as insulting to the U.S. military, a piece in the Los Angeles Times asserted that [...] "if any U.S. forces that ever existed were being insulted, it was the ones who fought under George Armstrong Custer, not David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal." [...] Other reviews saw Avatar as [...] "the bubbling up <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>military</b> subconscious... the wish to be free of all the paperwork and risk aversion of the modern Army—much more fun to fly, unarmored, on a winged beast." ...|$|E

[...] "With many <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>military</b> members serving two or three tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is past time to enact a new veterans’ education program modeled on the World War II era G.I. bill.

2500|$|In 2006, O'Brien {{noted that}} declining {{public support for}} war in Iraq was also leading to a {{decrease}} in morale among the troops, adding, [...] "The news only shows cars being blown up, but the soldiers see hospitals being built and schools opening."

You will declare that the United States will not invade Cuba with its troops and will not support any other forces which might intend to invade Cuba. Then the necessity of the presence <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>military</b> specialists in Cuba will disappear." [...] At 6:45pm EDT, news of Fomin's offer to Scali was finally heard and was interpreted as a [...] "set up" [...] {{for the arrival of}} Khrushchev's letter. The letter was then considered official and accurate although it was later learned that Fomin was almost certainly operating of his own accord without official backing. Additional study of the letter was ordered and continued into the night.|$|E

60|$|The nature <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>military</b> service {{took him}} to the frontier, where, for a number of years, he was {{stationed}} at various posts in the Far West. Here he was brought into frequent intercourse with Indian traders, mountain trappers, and other pioneers of the wilderness; and became so excited by their tales of wild scenes and wild adventures, and their accounts of vast and magnificent regions as yet unexplored, that an expedition to the Rocky Mountains became the ardent desire of his heart, and an enterprise to explore untrodden tracts, the leading object of his ambition.|$|E
