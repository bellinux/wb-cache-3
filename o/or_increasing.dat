5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of rhabdomyolysis may be suspected in {{anyone who has}} suffered trauma, crush injury or prolonged immobilization, {{but it may also}} be identified at a later stage due to deteriorating kidney function (abnormally raised <b>or</b> <b>increasing</b> creatinine and urea levels, falling urine output) or reddish-brown discoloration of the urine.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} dynamic equilibrium {{and effectively}} carry out certain functions, a system must detect {{and respond to}} perturbations. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through negative feedback that stabilize conditions by reducing <b>or</b> <b>increasing</b> the activity of an organ or system. One example is the release of glucagon when sugar levels are too low.|$|E

5|$|While small interfering RNAs (siRNA; 20-25nt) {{are often}} {{produced}} by breakdown of viral RNA, {{there are also}} endogenous sources of siRNAs. siRNAs act through RNA interference in a fashion similar to miRNAs. Some miRNAs and siRNAs can cause genes they target to be methylated, thereby decreasing <b>or</b> <b>increasing</b> transcription of those genes. Animals have Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNA; 29-30nt) that are active in germline cells and {{are thought to be}} a defense against transposons and play a role in gametogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Currently, common elands are not endangered. They are conserved by the United States Endangered Species Act, and {{regulated}} {{in international trade}} by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Using ground counts and aerial surveys, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) calculates the population density of the common eland to be between 0.05 and 1 per square kilometre with a total population estimate of 136,000. Populations are considered stable <b>or</b> <b>increasing</b> in the countries of Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Malawi and possibly Tanzania.|$|E

5|$|If {{the amount}} of current used exceeds the {{capability}} of the electrode, tungsten inclusions in the weld may result. Known as tungsten spitting, this can be identified with radiography and can be prevented by changing the type of electrode <b>or</b> <b>increasing</b> the electrode diameter. In addition, if the electrode is not well protected by the gas shield or the operator accidentally allows it to contact the molten metal, it can become dirty or contaminated. This often causes the welding arc to become unstable, requiring that the electrode be ground with a diamond abrasive to remove the impurity.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the Air Ministry {{approached}} Morris Motors Limited to ask {{how quickly}} their Cowley plant could be turned to aircraft production. In 1936 this informal request for major manufacturing facilities {{was turned into a}} formal scheme to boost British aircraft production capacity under the leadership of Herbert Austin, known as the shadow factory plan. Austin was given the task of building nine new factories, and to supplement the existing British car manufacturing industry by either adding to overall capacity <b>or</b> <b>increasing</b> the potential for reorganisation to produce aircraft and their engines.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} has {{an extensive}} range, estimated at 10millionsquare kilometres (3.8million square miles), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated 79 to 160 million individuals in Europe alone. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as Least Concern. In the western Palaearctic, populations are generally stable <b>or</b> <b>increasing,</b> {{but there have been}} local declines, especially on farmland, which may be due to agricultural policies that encouraged farmers to remove hedgerows (which provide nesting places), and to drain damp grassland and increase the use of pesticides, both of which could have reduced the availability of invertebrate food.|$|E

5|$|The {{tawny owl}} has a {{geographical}} range {{of at least}} 10millionkm2 (3.8millionmi2) and a large population including an estimated 970,000â€“2,000,000 individuals in Europe alone. Population trends have not been quantified, but {{there is evidence of}} an overall increase. This owl is not believed to meet the IUCN Red List criterion of declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations and is therefore evaluated as being of least concern. This species has expanded its range in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway and Ukraine, and populations are stable <b>or</b> <b>increasing</b> in most European countries. Declines have occurred in Finland, Estonia, Italy and Albania.|$|E
5|$|Wobble or shimmy {{begins when}} some {{otherwise}} minor irregularity, such as fork asymmetry, accelerates {{the wheel to}} one side. The restoring force is applied in phase with {{the progress of the}} irregularity, and the wheel turns to the other side where the process is repeated. If there is insufficient damping in the steering the oscillation will increase until system failure occurs. The oscillation frequency can be changed by changing the forward speed, making the bike stiffer or lighter, <b>or</b> <b>increasing</b> the stiffness of the steering, of which the rider is a main component.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation {{may cause}} either the gain {{of a new}} feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is {{bacterial}} adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying {{the target of the}} drug, <b>or</b> <b>increasing</b> the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell. Other striking examples are the bacteria Escherichia coli evolving the ability to use citric acid as a nutrient in a long-term laboratory experiment, Flavobacterium evolving a novel enzyme that allows these bacteria to grow on the by-products of nylon manufacturing, and the soil bacterium Sphingobium evolving an entirely new metabolic pathway that degrades the synthetic pesticide pentachlorophenol. An interesting but still controversial idea is that some adaptations might increase the ability of organisms to generate genetic diversity and adapt by natural selection (increasing organisms' evolvability).|$|E

5|$|At the {{greatest}} {{extent of the}} last glacial period around 18,000 years ago, southern Europe was characterised by cold open habitats, and the Alpine chough was found as far as south as southern Italy, well outside its current range. Some of these peripheral prehistoric populations persisted until recently, only to disappear within {{the last couple of}} centuries. In the Polish Tatra Mountains, where a population had survived since the glacial period, it was not found as a breeding bird after the 19th century. In Bulgaria, the number of breeding sites fell from 77 between 1950 and 1981 to just 14 in the 1996 to 2006 period, and the number of pairs in the remaining colonies were much smaller. The decline was thought to be due to the loss of former open grasslands which had reverted to scrubby vegetation once extensive cattle grazing ceased. Foraging habitat can also be lost to human activities such as the construction of ski resorts and other tourist development on former alpine meadows. Populations of choughs are stable <b>or</b> <b>increasing</b> in areas where traditional pastoral or other low intensity agriculture persists, but are declining or have become locally extinct where intensive farming methods have been introduced, such as Brittany, England, south-west Portugal and mainland Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The Binding of Isaac is a {{top-down}} dungeon crawler game, presented using two-dimensional sprites, {{in which}} the player controls Isaac or other unlockable characters as they explore the dungeons located in Isaac's basement. The characters differ in speed, amount of health, amount of damage they deal, and other attributes. The game's mechanics and presentation {{is similar to the}} dungeons of The Legend of Zelda, while incorporating random, procedurally-generated levels {{in the manner of a}} roguelike game. On each floor of the basement dungeon, the player must fight monsters in a room before continuing onto the next room. This is most commonly done by the character's tears as bullets in the style of a twin-stick shooter, but the player can also use a limited supply of bombs to damage enemies and clear out parts of the room. Other methods of defeating enemies become possible as the character gains power-ups, items that are automatically worn by the player-character when picked up that can alter the character's core attributes, such as increasing health or the strength of each tear, or cause additional side effects, such as for allowing charged tear shots to be fired after holding down a controller button for a short while, or a means to fire tears behind the character. Power-ups include passive items that improve the character's attributes automatically, active power-ups that can be used once before they are recharged by completing additional rooms in the dungeon, and single-use power-ups such as pills or Tarot cards that confer a one-time benefit when used, such as regaining full health, <b>or</b> <b>increasing</b> or decreasing all attributes of the character. The effect of power-ups stack, so that the player may come into highly-beneficial power-up combinations.|$|E
5|$|The post {{system was}} the {{cornerstone}} of Abir's commercial activity. Each post was run by one or two European agents to oversee local operations. The salary for an agent was 1,800 fr per year, sometimes increasing to 2,100 fr in the second year, and the standard contract period was three years. Agents also received 60 fr of trade goods each month with which to buy their food. Despite the low wages the 2% commission that each agent received on rubber production made {{up the majority of}} the agents' pay, for example the agent at Bongandanga received 16,800 fr in commission in 1903. As a result, there were many applicants for each post and agents were hired with the expectation that they would increase production by 0.5â€“3 tons per month. This was implemented by extending the post to include more villages <b>or</b> <b>increasing</b> the quotas expected from the villagers, often indirectly forcing women and children to harvest the rubber as well. If production fell below the quota agents made up the shortfall in lost profits to the company from their pay. Each post consisted of a residence for the agent, barracks for armed sentries and sheds for rubber drying and storage, all built using labour conscripted from the villagers. A typical post employed ten African workmen to sort and dry the rubber, seven servants for the agent and thirty canoemen for local river transport. These were paid around 36.5 fr per year in goods, commonly 5kg of salt, one blanket, five machetes and trade goods to the value of 6.35 fr. The post system was managed by the Director of Congo Operations at the central office in Basankusu. He was assisted in his job of keeping production up and expenses down by the only Free State employee in the concession, the commander of the police. The police commander was in charge of suppressing revolts and punishing villages which dropped below the quota. He had access to a large force of men and river steamers which was stationed at Basankusu and could redeploy quickly to the site of large scale rebellions. Effective police commanders would receive bonuses paid for by Abir.|$|E
