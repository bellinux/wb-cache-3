500|$|Patricia Routledge starred as Kitty, a self-righteous middle-aged {{spinster}} from Cheadle, who {{featured in}} a weekly monologue. To show the character's forthrightness, Wood had originally written Kitty's opening introduction as [...] "Hello, I'm Kitty. I've had a boob <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can't stomach whelks"; the [...] "boob off" [...] line was later changed to [...] "I've given gallons of blood". The Kitty character shared similarities with a character in one of Wood's earlier sketch shows, Wood and Walters, Dotty (then played by Julie Walters).|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} {{began on}} August 21, 1977 and {{took place in}} Midtown Manhattan at Media Sound Studios, a premises of a former Episcopalian Church. On {{the first day of}} sessions, guitarist Johnny Ramone brought a copy of the Sex Pistols' single [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] with him, remarking that their type of music [...] "robbed" [...] the band. He emphasized that the album's sound engineer Ed Stasium needed to incorporate better production than that of the Sex Pistols, to which Stasium replied [...] "no problem". Johnny relates: [...] "These guys ripped us <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> want to sound better than this." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the start}} date was pushed to November 1990 at both Babelsberg Studios in Munich, Germany and Barrandov Studios in Prague, Czech Republic. Production for The Phantom of the Opera was stalled with Lloyd Webber and Brightman's divorce. [...] "Everything got {{tied up in}} settlements", Schumacher reflected. [...] "Then my career took <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was really busy." [...] As a result, The Phantom of the Opera languished in {{development}} limbo for Warner Bros. throughout the 1990s. In February 1997, Schumacher considered returning, but eventually dropped out in favour of Batman Unchained, Runaway Jury and Dreamgirls. The studio was keen to cast John Travolta for the lead role, but also held discussions with Antonio Banderas, who undertook vocal preparation and sang {{the role of the}} Phantom in the TV special Andrew Lloyd Webber: The Royal Albert Hall Celebration.|$|E

Among them was Lynn Bomar, selected All-American end in 1923... I also had the responsibility, as a freshman, of awakening Bomar in time for him to get to classes, and at the end of the school year I did this one morning by rolling the biggest lighted firecracker I ever saw under his bed.

500|$|After the race, Sebastian Vettel criticised Lewis Hamilton {{for what}} he {{believed}} was excessive low speed at the restart after the safety car period, calling his behaviour [...] "ridiculous". He added: [...] "There {{was no reason to}} go that slow. If you want to pack up the field you can do it earlier and not in the very last bit." [...] Following his 46G impact on Saturday, Carlos Sainz conceded that he felt [...] "a bit of dizziness" [...] {{in the early stages of}} the Grand Prix, though he added: [...] "But after lap 10 it went <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could push normally without problems." [...] After his accident on lap twelve, Romain Grosjean spoke of his [...] "biggest impact for quite a while". He also revealed that the seat of his car broke at impact, but also emphasised the fact that he was able to escape unharmed: [...] "It's a testament to all the safety inherent in the car and the other safety devices." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would have loved to have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. Or maybe we could see her in prison?" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Sleeping {{with the}} One I Love" [...] {{revolves}} around Fantasia feeling torn between {{the stability of}} her boyfriend and the sensual pleasures of her lover. According to Wanda J. Coppage of Music Times, the lyrics focus on [...] "the {{story of a woman}} in search of love, but she seems to find it with the wrong type of men". Throughout the single, Fantasia [...] "candidly and guiltlessly" [...] discusses her affair by singing: [...] "I’m sleeping with the man I love because the one I’m with just ain’t good enough.” In the verses, Fantasia sings about her conflict with choosing between the two men, through lyrics such as: “Yes, I've tried to shake it <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> even tried to pray / But I'm still waking up in a bed that don't belong to me”. She expresses pain with the lyrics [...] "See my baby's like a dream, but the other man, he haunts me".

500|$|... "Dinosaur" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Kesha Sebert, in {{collaboration}} with Max Martin, Shellback; the latter two {{are responsible for the}} song's production. The song's lyrics and conception use a metaphor, comparing an older man to a prehistoric, carnivorous dinosaur. All three composers were responsible for providing the song's instruments. The song's recording was commenced at Maratone Studios, in Stockholm, Sweden, by Martin and Shellback. While being interviewed by Rolling Stone, Kesha was asked about her writing technique and how her songs come to fruition, which she explained using [...] "Dinosaur" [...] as an example. The singer explained that the song's conception was auto-biographical and that it stemmed from a previous experience she had when an older man had been hitting on her, which she elaborated on: [...] "I just write about what I live — literally, my entire record is totally autobiographical, because I think there's a great pop song in anything and everything, any situation. There's a song called 'Dinosaur' about this old guy who was hitting on me, and his toupee was kind of falling <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was like, 'Oh my God, you're so old, you're prehistoric, you're like a dinosaur. D-I-N-O-S-A-you are a dinosaur.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Casting for the {{character}} was hectic, with Oberman describing the process as a [...] "whirlwind" [...] affair. The role of the second Mrs Den Watts was highly sought after with Oberman eventually beating out high-profile stars like Patsy Kensit, Cheryl Baker and Joanna Lumley for the part. In a 2004 'Star Chat' interview featured in The People, Oberman commented on her casting: [...] "I couldn't have wished for a better part. I mean the Watts family are a national institution. When I realised I was auditioning {{for the role of}} Dirty Den's wife, my jaw just dropped. I never thought I'd get it. Amazing, swanky actresses, like Joanna Lumley and Patsy Kensit, were all considered, but Leslie Grantham and I had great chemistry from the <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think he said: 'I want her.'" [...] Oberman was on holiday when she received a call saying she had been cast in the role and was required to be on set the next Tuesday. All told the audition process had taken just two weeks, with Oberman beginning filming a mere ten days after her initial screen test. In fact the schedule was so tight that Oberman was on set and taping scenes before a contract had even been signed.|$|E

500|$|Kesha {{had been}} working on Animal for seven years prior to its release, and had written over 200 songs for the album. The {{abundance}} of material extended it from its originally planned twelve tracks to fourteen. Kesha felt that the album had an empowering, carefree message for young women. [...] "For girls, I think it's an empowering record, it's funny, it's cheeky," [...] she said. [...] "I think people need to have fun with whatever they're doing—makeup, their clothes, music, live shows—anything you don't need to take too seriously, don't take too seriously." [...] When asked how the album related to her life, Kesha explained that the album was completely autobiographical. [...] "I just write about what I live—literally, [...] I think there's a great pop song in anything and everything, any situation." [...] She cites her songs [...] "Stephen" [...] and [...] "Dinosaur" [...] as examples of this. She explained: [...] "it's about this guy I've been stalking since I was 15. I wrote the song when I was 16 with my mom, and I was like, [...] "This song's so dope, I know it is". [...] "Dinosaur" [...] came [...] "about [...] this old guy who was hitting on me, and his toupee was kind of falling <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was like, [...] "Oh my God, you're so old, you're prehistoric, you're like a dinosaur.
