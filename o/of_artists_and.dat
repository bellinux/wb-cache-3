5|$|The Birmingham School of {{landscape}} artists emerged with Daniel Bond in the 1760s and was to last into the mid 19th century. Its most important figure was David Cox, whose later works make him an important precursor of impressionism. The {{influence of the}} Royal Birmingham Society <b>of</b> <b>Artists</b> <b>and</b> the Birmingham School of Art made Birmingham an important centre of Victorian art, particularly within the Pre-Raphaelite and Arts and Crafts movements. Major figures included the Pre-Raphaelite and symbolist Edward Burne-Jones; Walter Langley, {{the first of the}} Newlyn School painters; and Joseph Southall, leader of the group <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> craftsmen known as the Birmingham Group.|$|E

Leonardo's earliest known dated work is a drawing in pen and ink of the Arno valley, drawn on 5 August 1473.|$|E

5|$|The {{charting}} and {{conquest of}} this new world made real regions previously only idealised in the imagination <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> poets. At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as exemplified by the writings of Thomas More (1478â€“1535).|$|E
5|$|Although {{most of the}} {{writings}} that have survived from this period are religious in nature, there is sufficient literary evidence that secular writing was also popular in the imperial court. Some of these writings carry useful information on urban life, grandeur of the imperial and provincial courts, royal weddings and ceremonies. Other works refer the general town planning, fortifications and ordnance details at Vijayanagara and other important cities, irrigation reservoirs, merchants and shops dealing {{in a variety of}} commodities. On occasion, authors dwell on mythical cities that reflect their idealised views on contemporary life. Commonly found in these works are description <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> professionals and their relationship with the court. These included poets, bards, composers, painters, sculptors, dancers, theatrical performers and even wrestlers. Others who find mention are political leaders, ambassadors, concubines, accountants, goldsmiths, moneylenders and even servants and door keepers.|$|E

5|$|By the 1980s, {{planning}} blight {{had affected}} {{the area and}} many of the houses had become home to a community <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> squatters. Eventually, contractors were appointed to carry out the work and a compulsory purchase of property along the proposed route was undertaken. In March 1993, in preparation for the construction of the road, the Earl of Caithness, then the Minister of State for Transport, estimated that there would be 263 properties scheduled for demolition, displacing 550 people, of which he estimated 172 were seeking rehousing. Several original residents, who had in some cases lived in their homes all their lives, refused to sell or move out of their properties.|$|E
5|$|Following his graduation, {{he worked}} for the BBC's {{classical}} music department, then joined EMI in 1950 as an assistant to Oscar Preuss, the head of EMI's Parlophone Records from 1950 to 1955. Although having been regarded by EMI as a vital German imprint in the past, it was then not taken seriously and only used for EMI's insignificant acts. After taking over Parlophone, as head <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> repertoire, when Preuss retired in 1955, Martin recorded classical and Baroque music, original cast recordings, and regional music from around Britain and Ireland.|$|E

Lacking the necessary funding, they approached RCTI in search of sponsorship but were refused, and laughingly told that they should try holding a concert at the National Monument. Undeterred, Chrisye, Subaktyo, and Gutawa put together a group <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> began rehearsals. Around the time of RCTI's fourth anniversary, the television station relented and agreed to fund the concert as part of their celebrations; the thousands of tickets available sold out within a week.|$|E

5|$|Hahn {{recalled}} {{some difficulty}} in finding someone {{to host the}} film, so the studio decided to use a group <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> musicians from various fields of entertainment. The interstitials were filmed in various locations; the orchestra, Jones, Lansbury, and Bronfman were shot in Los Angeles, Perlman and Middler in New York City, and others in Boston, Massachusetts. Each scene was filmed {{in front of a}} green screen to allow shots of the orchestra or the set to be placed behind them. The shots of Levine, the artists, and the orchestra were filmed on October 31, 1998. The piano Grierson plays in his scene with Jones is the same one on which he played Rhapsody in Blue for the soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|In late 1957, Cameron {{moved to}} San Francisco {{with her friends}} Norman Rose and David Metzer. There she mingled within the same bohemian social circles {{as many of the}} beat {{generation}} <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> writers, and was a regular at avant-garde poetry readings. She began a relationship with the artist Burt Shonberg, and with him moved into a ranch outside of Joshua Tree. Together they began exploring the subject of Ufology, and became friends with the ufologist George Van Tassel. After Kimmel was released from a psychiatric ward, Cameron re-established her relationship with him, and in 1959 they were married in a civil ceremony at Santa Monica City Hall; their relationship was strained and they separated soon after.|$|E

However, Nevinson fell out with Lewis and the other 'rebel' artists when he attached their names to the Futurist movement.

5|$|Over the years, several {{films about}} Anne Frank appeared. Her life and {{writings}} have inspired {{a diverse group}} <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> social commentators to make reference to her in literature, popular music, television, and other media. These include The Anne Frank Ballet by Adam Darius, first performed in 1959, and the choral work Annelies, first performed in 2005. The only known footage of the real Anne Frank comes from a 1941 silent film recorded for her newlywed next-door neighbour. She is seen leaning out of a second-floor window {{in an attempt to}} better view the bride and groom. The couple, who survived the war, gave the film to the Anne Frank House.|$|E
5|$|Slavonia {{significantly}} {{contributed to}} the culture of Croatia as a whole, both through works <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> through patrons of the artsâ€”most notable among them being Josip Juraj Strossmayer. Strossmayer was instrumental in the establishment of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts, later renamed the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and the reestablishment of the University of Zagreb. A number of Slavonia's artists, especially writers, made considerable contributions to Croatian culture. Nineteenth-century writers who are most significant in Croatian literature include Josip Eugen TomiÄ‡, Josip Kozarac, and Miroslav KraljeviÄ‡â€”author of the first Croatian novel. Significant twentieth-century poets and writers in Slavonia were DobriÅ¡a CesariÄ‡, Dragutin TadijanoviÄ‡, Ivana BrliÄ‡-MaÅ¾uraniÄ‡ and Antun Gustav MatoÅ¡. Painters associated with Slavonia, who contributed greatly to Croatian art, were Miroslav KraljeviÄ‡ and Bela ÄŒikoÅ¡ Sesija.|$|E

Brooke soon lusts for Nell, and his increased interest in her leads to unconventional encounters. They develop a friendship in which both Nell and Brooke hold secret admiration and love for the other, but are unable to express it because of social conventions. Brooke also desires to lose his virginity because he feels that being a virgin is disgraceful. Because he cannot convince Nell or any of several other women to succumb to his wooing, he loses it in a homosexual encounter with a boyhood friend, Denham Russell-Smith.|$|E

5|$|The Italian Peninsula was not {{the only}} region from which Napoleon took art. Under the Directory {{government}} of the 1790s, Napoleon (then a General) led an expedition to Egypt. The campaign was an expansionist {{effort on the part of}} the government, but the Directory had another goal to make Paris the center of art, science, and culture. The Directory wanted France to assume responsibility for liberating the works of art they deemed in danger in order to protect and nationalize the heritage and culture of their subjects. As a result, there were teams <b>of</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> scientists who accompanied the armies into battle equipped with lists of paintings, sculptures, and other pieces of patrimony that would be collected, crated, and shipped back to France.|$|E
