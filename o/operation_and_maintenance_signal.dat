50|$|While OOTS and the Districts {{oversee the}} installation, modification, <b>operation,</b> <b>maintenance,</b> <b>and</b> removal of traffic signals along State roadways, Montgomery County differs {{in that it}} is {{responsible}} for the <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> of all <b>signals</b> within the County—even those along State roadways. However, the Districts and OOTS still control decisions regarding the installation, modification (including phasing), and removal of signals. A result of this agreement is that it relieves MdSHA of some of the additional resource cost of the regular duties with regards to signals.|$|R
40|$|FOREWORD The {{purpose of}} the Signal Timing Manual is to provide {{direction}} and guidance to managers, supervisors, and practitioners based on sound practice to proactively and comprehensively improve signal timing. The outcome of properly training staff and proactively operating and maintaining traffic signals is signal timing that reduces congestion and fuel consumption ultimately improving our {{quality of life and}} the air we breathe. This manual provides an easy-to-use concise, practical and modular guide on signal timing. The elements of signal timing from policy and funding considerations to timing plan development, assessment, <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> are covered in the manual. The manual is the culmination of research into practices across North America and serves as a reference for a range of practitioners, from those involved in the day to day management, <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> of traffic <b>signals</b> to those that plan, design, operate and maintain these systems...|$|R
40|$|Data {{collection}} and performance measurement for signalized arterial roads {{is an area}} of emerging focus in the United States. As indicated by the results of the 2005 Traffic Signal Operation Self-Assessment Survey, a majority of agencies involved in the <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> of traffic <b>signal</b> systems do not monitor or archive traffic system performance and thus have limited means to improve their operation. With support from the Transportation Department of Hennepin County, Minneapolis, MN, a system for high resolution traffic signal data {{collection and}} arterial performance measurement has been successfully built. The system, named SMART-SIGNAL (Systematic Monitoring of Arterial Road Traffic Signals), is able to collect and archive event-based traffic signal data simultaneously at multiple intersections. Using the event-based traffic data, SMART-SIGNAL can generate timedependent performance measures for both individual intersections and arterials including intersection queue length and arterial travel time. The SMART-SIGNAL system has been deployed at an 11 -intersection corridor along France Avenue in south Minneapolis and the estimated performance measures for both intersection queue length and arterial travel times are highly consistent with the observed data.

40|$|Abstract—Power system {{communication}} network operation & maintenance {{is most important}} for power system stability. With the development of power system {{communication network}} and the merging of information and communication, the requirement of power system communication management is higher and higher. And the rules of power system communication network is much more complex than before. So it is very urgent for power system communication department to establish the power system <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> hierarchy to meet the changing situation. In this paper, based on the analysis the current work for power system communication <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance,</b> a power system communication <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> with "one data platform, two management principle lines, three <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> modules " is carried out.

40|$|Building {{maintenance}} {{is essential in}} preserving buildings’ appearance and performance. It needs to upkeep the building performance to prolong its value and building life cycle. Malaysia is still lacking in managing cost for building <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance.</b> It {{has been found that}} the cost for housing {{maintenance is}} high due to poor maintenance practices. In order to get better understanding on how to manage the cost, this study reviews the contributing factors that affecting <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> cost of stratified buildings in Malaysia. The research first identified the factors through extensive literature review and scrutinize on factors that affecting <b>and</b> can minimize <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> cost. This literature review offers insight into building maintenance scenario in Malaysia focusing on the issues and challenges. The study also finds that <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> cost for housing in Malaysia is still in poor state. Interestingly, this paper revealed that <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> cost is also influenced by three significant factors like expectation of tenants, building characteristics and building defects. Measures to reduce the housing <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> cost are also highlighted so that this study can be a stepping stone towards proposing efficient and effective facilities management strategies for affordable housing in future...|$|R
