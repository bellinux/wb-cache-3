The Times of London, in a similar ranking, had the two in tenth and eight respectively, while placing fourth 1942's Holiday Inn, the movie that launched Bing Crosby's White Christmas.

500|$|In early reviews, the art {{and writing}} were praised. Reviewer Ginnis Tonic liked how the series has a {{specific}} focus on non-whites, such as the Hmong and Native Americans {{who live in the}} area. Slate columnist Dan Kois described the series as [...] "grounded in the economic and familial realities <b>of</b> <b>small-town</b> life". Truitt found the mood and themes to be a mix of Elmore Leonard and the Coen brothers. [...] Kois described Norton's art as [...] "wonderfully specific and evocative of the rural Midwest". Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza liked the way Norton used a variety of body shapes and sizes for the cast and thought Englert's colors added an [...] "edginess" [...] to the story. Tonic found the subtle background details, such as music posters and the cleanliness of bedrooms, added to her understanding of the characters. James Fulton, writing for Inside Pulse, also noted touches like these excited him [...] "like few have in comics in the last few years." ...|$|E
500|$|Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) is {{the bright}} and talented {{newcomer}} to Los Angeles, described as [...] "wholesome, optimistic, determined {{to take the}} town by storm", and [...] "absurdly naïve". Her perkiness and intrepid approach to helping Rita {{because it is the}} right thing to do is reminiscent of Nancy Drew for reviewers. Her entire persona at first is an apparent cliché <b>of</b> <b>small-town</b> naïveté. But it is Betty's identity, or loss of it, that appears to be the focus of the film. For one critic, Betty performed the role of the film's consciousness and unconscious. Naomi Watts, who modeled Betty on Doris Day, Tippi Hedren and Kim Novak, observed that Betty is a thrill-seeker, someone [...] "who finds herself in a world she doesn't belong in and is ready to take on a new identity, even if it's somebody else's". This has also led one theorist to conclude that since Betty had naïvely, yet eagerly entered the Hollywood system, she had become a [...] "complicit actor" [...] who had [...] "embraced the very structure that" [...] destroyed her. In an explanation of her development of the Betty character, Watts stated: ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. John Kubicek of BuddyTV {{called it}} [...] "easily my favorite {{episode of the}} past two seasons, and quite possibly one of the best episodes the show has ever made". Damian Holbrook of TV Guide described it and the episode that followed, [...] "Nationals", as [...] "clever, funny and filled with moments that felt like little gifts to the fans who have hung in there". Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said the [...] "double feature continued the recent hot streak" [...] of episodes, and Michael Slezak of TVLine highlighted this episode's [...] "script that winkingly acknowledged fan complaints that Ryan Murphy & Co. all too often ignore some of Glee original players in favor of new and more-hyped flavors". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote that it showcased writer and director Ian Brennan's [...] "strengths of acid comedy and sad stories <b>of</b> <b>small-town</b> teenagers who'll never get anything but to sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream"; he gave [...] "Props" [...] a [...] "B" [...] grade.

They described [...] "They Saved Lisa's Brain" [...] as an [...] "epitome" [...] of The Simpsons diverse comedic humor, and wrote {{that it can be}} [...] "enjoyed in two levels", as both [...] "broad farce" [...] and [...] "intellectual satire". As an example of the episode's farcical humor, they referred to the episode's subplot, which, they wrote, [...] "contains some of the grossest humor in the long history of The Simpsons." [...] At the same time, the episode is [...] "filled" [...] with what they described as [...] "subtle cultural allusions", such as the design of Mensa group's locale, which is based on American architect Frank Lloyd Wright's house. Likewise, Lisa's challenge to Springfield calls attention to the [...] "cultural limitations <b>of</b> <b>small-town</b> America", while the episode also argues that intellectual disdain for the common man can be carried too far and that theory can [...] "all too easily lose touch with common sense". They also argued that the episode, as well as the series as a whole, offers a kind of intellectual defense of the common man against intellectuals, which they opined [...] "helps explain its popularity and broad appeal [...] defends the common man against the intellectual, in a way that both the common man and the intellectual can understand and enjoy." ...|$|E
500|$|Time James Poniewozik {{wrote that}} with [...] "Journey to Regionals", Glee [...] "returned to its roots, {{balancing}} its weirdness, snark and bombast with intimate stories <b>of</b> <b>small-town</b> high school life. And it, too, by showing {{what it can}} be at its best, made its case for staying around another year." [...] IGN's Eric Goldman rated [...] "Journey to Regionals" [...] 8.5/10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] episode. He felt that while it did not match {{the standards of the}} mid–season finale episode [...] "Sectionals", it was [...] "still a very satisfying wrap up to the first year of Glee." [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted that he [...] "went into the finale peeved at how incredibly messy last week's episode was", but overall he deemed the finale a success. Vanity Fair Brett Berk found [...] "Journey to Regionals" [...] a fulfilling, albeit [...] "pretty mediocre" [...] episode, describing it as having [...] "a sense of narrative cohesion that went beyond the writers’ usual throwing-flatware-down-the-garburator modality". Jean Bentley of MTV found the episode representative of the first season as a whole, explaining: [...] "Much like the entire first year of the show, the uneven episode started out with a promising, action-packed plot, impressed with a couple of flashy musical numbers, then got too cheesy for its own good and petered out with an overly sentimental song." [...] Fellow MTV writer Aly Semigran noted: [...] "I was hoping for a little more excitement from the episode, though it all did feel very full circle for so many of our characters we've come to know and love. Here's to hoping Glee can get back its stellar momentum in season two." ...|$|E

Most university activities take place on Tarleton's centrally located, 173 acre (700,000 m²) main campus.

2500|$|The {{plot was}} {{positively}} received as [...] "quirky" [...] and [...] "bizarre and entertaining". A reviewer for Edge wrote: [...] "The beauty of Deadly Premonition is that it's a straightforward whodunnit viewed through the cracked prism of an unreliable narrator, conjuring {{an atmosphere of}} suspicion and confusion throughout." [...] According to Destructoids Jim Sterling, after the prologue, Deadly Premonition [...] "becomes a ludicrous pantomime of pop culture references, shamelessly contrived humor, {{and the kind of}} dialog that leaves you both scratching your head and laughing your face off." [...] The characters were positively received by reviewers as memorable, endearing, [...] "fascinating", and [...] "charming". [...] Tom Hoggins of The Telegraph remarked that the characters served as [...] "cartoon interpretations <b>of</b> <b>small-town</b> Americana" [...] with distinct personalities. According to IGN UK, the interaction with characters and uncovering the details of their fictional lives helped [...] "to fashion a genuine, albeit silly, emotional core - and its payoff resonates long after the credits have rolled as a result." [...] Matt Keil of G4TV described York as [...] "an oddly endearing character considering his arrogant behavior early on", with his love of films, video games, and music being a highlight. Eurogamer summed him up as [...] "a grade-A fruit-loop with a side of narcissism, {{and one of the most}} interesting gaming protagonists for years." [...] Reviewers also saw similarities in Deadly Premonitions characters with the characters of Twin Peaks.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{despite the}} {{increased}} population, the area still maintains a bit <b>of</b> <b>small-town</b> atmosphere, with relatively low house turnover. A {{real estate broker}} {{who grew up in}} the area said that in Windsor Terrace, [...] "everybody says hello" [...] to each other, and a real-estate feature in The New York Times stated that [...] "residents look out for one another at all hours of the day." [...] There is more on-street vehicle parking in Windsor Terrace than in nearby, more populous neighborhoods. The area's lack of traffic lights, due to low traffic volumes, make Windsor Terrace feel like a small town, as do well-maintained one-family houses, some with covered balconies and stained glass windows; other houses with [...] "bay windows, both rounded and faceted"; and yet other [...] "clapboard Italianate" [...] houses with multicolored cornices. There are a few apartment buildings, including Windsor Tower, a 10-story building that was downgraded from 22 stories after community objections; a 73-unit, seven-floor rental building that opened in 2015; and a condominium tower at 279 Prospect Park W, a former paint factory storage building that posed as a bank in the 1975 movie Dog Day Afternoon. The houses are of varying types, including some small one-story clapboard houses that have attics and date to the neighborhood's development; larger two-story houses with basements and some wood framing on the exterior; and attached brick townhouses with either flat facades with normal-sized windows or curved facades with bay windows, both with two floors and a basement.|$|E
2500|$|Dewey {{was born}} and raised in Owosso, Michigan, where his father, George Martin Dewey, Jr. owned, edited, and {{published}} the local newspaper, the Owosso Times. His mother, Annie (Thomas), whom he called [...] "Mater," [...] bequeathed her son [...] "a healthy respect for common sense and the average man or woman who possessed it." [...] She also left [...] "a headstrong assertiveness that many took for conceit, a set <b>of</b> <b>small-town</b> values never entirely erased by exposure to the sophisticated East, and a sense of proportion that moderated triumph and eased defeat." [...] One journalist noted that [...] " [...] he did show leadership and ambition above the average; by the time he was thirteen, he had a crew of nine other youngsters working for him" [...] selling magazines in Owosso. A biographer wrote that [...] "the bent of his mind, from his earliest days, was towards debate", and his high school senior yearbook in 1919 gave him the caption [...] "First in the council hall to steer the state, and ever foremost in a tongue debate." [...] He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1923, and from Columbia Law School in 1925. While at the University of Michigan, he joined Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, a national fraternity for men of music, and was a member of the Men's Glee Club. He was an excellent singer with a deep, baritone voice, and in 1923 he finished in third place in the National Singing Contest. He briefly considered a career as a professional singer, but decided against it after a temporary throat ailment convinced him that such a career would be risky. He then decided to pursue a career as a lawyer. He also wrote for The Michigan Daily, the university's student newspaper.|$|E
