5|$|Cognitive and emotional: neuropsychiatric {{symptomatology}} {{is common}} {{in the course of}} the disease. Depression and anxiety appear in up to 80% of patients,. Emotional lability leading to uncontrollable crying is also common. These symptoms can be treated with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy; however, high quality studies on efficacy are lacking. For example, in the specific case of antidepressants and depression, only two studies were considered worth considering as of 2011 by the Cochrane collaboration and they only showed a trend towards efficacy. Other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and disinhibition. Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of MS even after the introduction of disease-modifying treatments in the last 20 years. Although the disease is usually the primary cause of cognitive problems, other factors such as medications, relapses or depression may be enhancing them so a correct evaluation of the deficits and factors exacerbating them is important. Regarding primary deficits, data point towards administration of L-amphetamine and methylphenidate being useful, whereas memantine and anticholinesterase drugs such as donepezil—commonly used in Alzheimer disease— are not considered effective in improving cognitive functions. Effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy is more controverted. For those patients with MS who have pseudobulbar affect (PBA), characterized by uncontrollable episodes <b>of</b> <b>crying</b> and/or laughing, or other emotional displays, Dextromethorphan/quinidine can be considered as treatment as it is the only FDA approved drug for treatment for PBA, though other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants have been used in clinical practice.|$|E

40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CRY 1 and CRY 2 genes, which encode ribosomal protein rp 59, are {{expressed}} at a 10 : 1 ratio in wild-type cells. Deletion or inactivation <b>of</b> <b>CRY</b> 1 leads to 5 - to 10 -fold-increased levels <b>of</b> <b>CRY</b> 2 mRNA. Ribosomal protein 59, expressed from either CRY 1 or CRY 2, represses expression <b>of</b> <b>CRY</b> 2 but not CRY 1. cis-Acting elements involved in repression <b>of</b> <b>CRY</b> 2 {{were identified by}} assaying the expression <b>of</b> <b>CRY</b> 2 -lacZ gene fusions and promoter fusions in CRY 1 CRY 2 and cry 1 -D CRY 2 strains. Sequences necessary and sufficient for regulation lie within the transcribed region <b>of</b> <b>CRY</b> 2, including the 5 * exon and the first 62 nucleotides of the intron. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>CRY</b> 2 point mutations corroborates these results and indicates that both the secondary structure and sequence of the regulatory region <b>of</b> <b>CRY</b> 2 pre-mRNA are necessary for repression. The regulatory sequence <b>of</b> <b>CRY</b> 2 is phylogenetically conserved; a very similar sequence {{is present in the}} 5 * end of the RP 59 gene of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis.

40|$|Circadian {{molecular}} oscillation {{is generated}} by a transcription/translation-based feedback loop in which CRY proteins play critical roles as potent inhibitors for E-box-dependent clock gene expression. Although CRY 2 undergoes rhythmic phosphorylation in its C-terminal tail, structurally distinct from the CRY 1 tail, little is understood about how protein kinase(s) controls the CRY 2 -specific phosphorylation and contributes to the molecular clockwork. Here we found that Ser 557 in the C-terminal tail <b>of</b> <b>CRY</b> 2 is phosphorylated by DYRK 1 A as a priming kinase for subsequent GSK- 3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) -mediated phosphorylation of Ser 553, which leads to proteasomal degradation <b>of</b> <b>CRY</b> 2. In the mouse liver, DYRK 1 A kinase activity toward Ser 557 <b>of</b> <b>CRY</b> 2 showed circadian variation, with its peak in the accumulating phase <b>of</b> <b>CRY</b> 2 protein. Knockdown of Dyrk 1 a caused abnormal accumulation <b>of</b> cytosolic <b>CRY</b> 2, advancing the timing of a nuclear increase <b>of</b> <b>CRY</b> 2, and shortened the period length of the cellular circadian rhythm.

In addition, a key to differentiating depression from PBA is duration: PBA episodes are sudden, occurring in a brief episodic manner, while crying in depression is a more sustained presentation and closely relates to the underlying mood state. The level of control that one has over the crying episodes in PBA is minimal or nonexistent, whereas for those suffering from depression, the emotional expression (typically crying) can be modulated by the situation. Similarly, the trigger for episodes <b>of</b> <b>crying</b> in patients with PBA may be nonspecific, minimal or inappropriate to the situation, but in depression the stimulus is specific to the mood-related condition.

40|$|The {{widespread}} use <b>of</b> <b>Cry</b> proteins in insecticide formulations and transgenic crops for insect control {{has led to}} an increased interest in the environmental fate of these proteins. Several detection methods are available to monitor the fate <b>of</b> <b>Cry</b> proteins in the environment, but enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have emerged as the preferred detection method, because they are cost-effective, easy to use, and provide rapid results. Validation methodology, which is essential to ensure accurate measurement <b>of</b> <b>Cry</b> proteins in environmental matrices, has been researched extensively, but most of this research has overlooked biological validation of ELISA results. This oversight has led to concerns that environmental studies utilizing ELISAs may be overestimating the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>Cry</b> proteins in the environment, which may affect the risk assessments for these proteins. A literature review discusses the history and usage <b>of</b> <b>Cry</b> proteins for insect pest control and discusses the use and validation of ELISAs for detection <b>of</b> <b>Cry</b> proteins in environmental samples. The concept of biologically validating ELISA results is introduced, and a critical review of published literature examines the state of ELISA usage and validation, including identifying areas for improvement. Eight different types of model systems were screened for their ability to produce fragments <b>of</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab protein, and five of these model systems prove capable <b>of</b> generating <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab fragments. The fragments from these five model systems are then analyzed with ELISAs and bioassays to determine if the fragments are detectable or retain bioactivity. Fragments from four of the model systems are not detectable by ELISA and do not retain bioactivity. Fragments from the fifth model system are detectable by ELISA and do retain bioactivity. These results indicate that the use of ELISAs in environmental fate studies are providing an accurate determination of the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>Cry</b> proteins in the environment and are not overestimating the concentrations.

Recently discovered cadherin-based Bt Cry synergists showed the potential to augment resistance management by improving efficacy <b>of</b> <b>Cry</b> toxins. However, the mode of action <b>of</b> Bt <b>Cry</b> synergists is thus far unclear. Here we elucidate the mechanism <b>of</b> cadherin-based <b>Cry</b> toxin synergism utilizing two cadherin peptides, Spodoptera frugiperda Cad (SfCad) and Manduca sexta Cad (MsCad), which differentially enhance Cry 1 Fa toxicity to Spodoptera frugiperda neonates. We show that differential SfCad- and MsCad-mediated protection <b>of</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Fa toxin in the Spodoptera frugiperda midgut correlates with differential Cry 1 Fa toxicity enhancement.

However, only SfCad bound the S. frugiperda brush border membrane vesicle and more effectively prolonged the stability <b>of</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Fa toxin in the gut, explaining higher Cry 1 Fa enhancement by this peptide. This study shows that cadherin fragments may enhance B. thuringiensis toxicity by at least two different mechanisms or a combination thereof: (i) protection <b>of</b> <b>Cry</b> toxin from protease degradation in the insect midgut and (ii) enhancement of pore-forming ability <b>of</b> <b>Cry</b> toxin...|$|R
