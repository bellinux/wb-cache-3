25|$|Positions on the {{existence}} of God can be divided along numerous axes, producing a variety of orthogonal classifications. Theism and atheism are positions of belief (<b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it),</b> while gnosticism and agnosticism are positions of knowledge (or the lack of it). Ignosticism concerns belief regarding God's conceptual coherence. Apatheism concerns belief regarding the practical importance of whether God exists.|$|E

Christians are obligated to be at peace with all men, {{as far as it}} is up to them, and to submit to governments for the Lord's sake, and to pray for enemies.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes {{during the}} {{testimony}} of a witness, the witness may be questioned about statements he previously made outside court on an earlier occasion, to demonstrate either {{that he has been}} consistent or inconsistent in his account of events. The Act did not change the circumstances in which such statements could become admissible in evidence (which are still prescribed in the Criminal Procedure Act 1865), but it did change the evidential effect of such statements once admitted. Formerly, such statements were not evidence of the facts stated in them (unless the witness agreed with them in court): they only proved that the witness had kept his story straight or had changed his story, and so were only evidence of his credibility (<b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it)</b> as a witness. They were not hearsay. Under the 2003 Act, however, such statements are now themselves evidence of any facts stated in them, not just of credibility, and so are now hearsay.|$|E
25|$|While {{she was in}} Qazvin, her uncle, Mulla Muhammad Taqi Baraghani, was murdered, and {{the blame}} for this placed on her by her husband, even though she denied any involvement. Baraghani had been an inveterate enemy of Shaykh Ahmad. During Táhirih's stay in Qazvin, Baraghani had {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} sermons in which he attacked the Báb and his followers. There is no hard evidence as to the identity of the murderer, nor any proof as to Táhirih's involvement <b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> With her arrest Táhirih’s powerful father convinced the authorities that rather than kill Táhirih, she would be imprisoned in her home. Táhirih’s father kept her under house-arrest in his cellar, appointing her maids to act as spies. Though interpreted as a cruel act in Root’s interviews with family members of Táhirih one claimed this was done out of genuine fear for her safety. Her father was convinced of his daughters’ innocence, but her husband was violently against her. He argued that Táhirih be put on trial for the murder of her uncle. Her father positively refused citing Táhirih would never leave her home. Nevertheless, authorities forcefully arrested Táhirih and one of her maids in the hope that she would testify against her.|$|E
500|$|Some {{groups within}} the Christian metal {{movement}} have criticized bands within the industry for isolating the genre from general industry too avidly. For example, Christer Espevoll of Extol stated in 2003: [...] "I wish the scenes were more together. [...] For a long time {{there has been a}} huge – and still growing – distance between Christian and secular music industries. This is the situation peculiarly in the US but also in Scandinavia. In my opinion this kind of polarization is not a good thing. Music is first and foremost about music so why should every band or artist that represents a religion <b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> have its own industry? Music has no religious borders." [...] However, most Christian bands today oppose to being isolated in the Christian music industry and have become mainstream successes, such as Virgin Black, and Norma Jean.|$|E

500|$|The {{gynecologist}} William Masters, the sexologist Virginia E. Johnson and {{the physician}} Robert C. Kolodny wrote that Sexual Preference {{is an important}} study of homosexuality, [...] "probably the most extensive one done to date", and that it provided no support for Bieber's theory of homosexuality. Weeks referred to Sexual Preference as [...] "the Kinsey Institute's final publication on homosexuality" [...] and suggested that like sociobiologists {{and others who have}} attempted to find a biological explanation for social behavior Bell et al. had an [...] "urge to fill a conceptual gap" [...] that is stronger than their [...] "adherence to theoretical consistency and political judgment". Weeks wrote that while Bell et al. [...] "carefully explore the evidence (<b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it)</b> for the aetiology of homosexuality", they, unlike Kinsey, failed to consider the possibility [...] "that homosexuality might not be a unitary phenomenon with a single causative explanation". Weeks criticized Bell et al. for concluding that if a social or psychological explanation of homosexuality cannot be found then a biological explanation must exist, deeming the argument [...] "a rhetorical device" [...] that results in [...] "an intellectual closure which obstructs further questioning." [...] The sociologists Frederick L. Whitam and Robin Mathy, writing in Male Homosexuality in Four Societies (1985), criticized Bell et al. for reporting mainly on their white subjects, generally ignoring the blacks.|$|E
500|$|Canning's honesty (<b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it)</b> and Fielding's {{handling}} of the case were raised in a deeply critical attack printed by The London Daily Advertiser. [...] On {{the same day that}} Gascoyne ordered Canning's arrest an advertisement appeared in the Public Advertiser, asking its readers [...] "to suspend their judgement in the Case of the Gypsy Woman till a full State of the whole, which is now being prepared by Mr. Fielding, is published." [...] Fielding had learnt of Hall's questioning by Gascoyne and had brought Canning to his house in Bow Street, to [...] "sift the truth out of her, and to bring her to confession if she was guilty." [...] Satisfied with her account, and unconcerned with Hall, his critique of Squires' supporters was published as A Clear Statement of the Case of Elizabeth Canning, in which he espoused the virtuous nature of the young maid and attacked those her detractors. [...] Copies sold so quickly that a second print run was ordered two days later. [...] John Hill saw A Clear Statement as a direct attack on Gascoyne, and blasted Fielding with The Story of Elizabeth Canning Considered, which ridiculed his enemy with such comments as: [...] "Who Sir, are you, that are thus dictating unto the Government? [...] Retire into yourself and know your station." [...] Fielding, however, played little part in the saga from thereon, believing that Canning's supporters had begun to see him as an obstacle to their case.|$|E
500|$|The {{prescribed}} readings for the Sunday {{are from}} the Epistle to the Romans, [...] "By Christ's death we are dead for sin" [...] (...) , and from the Gospel of Matthew a passage from the Sermon on the Mount about better justice than the justice of merely observing laws and rules (...) [...] The [...] hymn in 14 stanzas matches {{the topic of the}} gospel. An unknown poet transformed the first 12 stanzas of the chorale to seven cantata movements. Dropping the last two stanzas, the librettist retaines the first stanza as the first movement, and the 12th as the last movement. He rephrased stanzas 2–4 to a recitative (2), stanzas 5–7 to a recitative (4), stanzas 9–11 to a third recitative (6). Ideas from stanza 8 were made an aria (5), and movement 3 is not derived directly from the chorale, but intensifies the conclusion of the first recitative. The three recitatives can be considered a sermon, according to Julian Mincham, who comments: [...] "All three speak of God's Laws; their bestowal, their fulfillment (<b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it)</b> and our attitudes towards them", and who summarizes: [...] "The three recitatives were clearly planned as a cognate group and encapsulate the fundamental Lutheran creed. The two intervening arias, and finally the chorale, reflect upon and extend their statements." [...] The Bach scholar Christoph Wolff assumes that the text was already written for Bach's 1724 cycle of chorale cantatas by the same librettist.|$|E

This is evidenced by al-Bulqini's commentary on Ibn al-Salah's statement. Al-Bulqini commented that [...] "the terminology of the hadith specialists is more than this, while, at the same time, is only ṣaḥīḥ and its opposite. Perhaps what has been intended by the latter categorization (i.e. into two categories) relates to standards of religious authority, <b>or</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> in general, and what will be mentioned afterwards (i.e. the sixty-five categories) is a specification of that generality." ...|$|E
