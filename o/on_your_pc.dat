The interactive tabletop at the basement of Amalienstrasse 17 is camera-based. It returns the coordinates of two touch points at the most and one ID for each set of coordinates. The tabletop can not distinguish between people or objects. Also it cannot detect forms. You will be programming in C#.

50|$|Short {{cycle times}} can be {{achieved}} since the host microprocessors in the slave devices {{are not involved in}} the processing of the Ethernet packets to transfer the process images. All process data communication is handled in the slave controller hardware.

Data for and from 100 servo axis can be updated with up to 10 kHz. Typical network update rates are 1-30 kHz, but EtherCAT can be used with slower cycle times, too, if the DMA load is too high <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>PC.</b>|$|E

[...] The game was written using an early game design system for IF, Adventure Game Toolkit (AGT) developed by Mark Welch and David Malmberg, and won the 5th Annual Softworks AGT game-writing contest in 1991. The following year Shades of Gray: an Adventure in Black and White, a game co-authored by a team of Compuserve Gamer’s Forum members, for which Pintar was the principle designer, won the 6th Annual AGT contest in the group category. [...] Shades of Gray is “generally considered the finest AGT game of all time.” The collaborative authorship of the game is referenced as an example of the kinds of creative possibilities that emerged within the early online IF community.

5000|$|Upon release, Arcanum had mostly {{positive}} review scores, receiving two Editor's Choice Awards from IGN and GameZone {{with scores}} of 8.7 out of 10 and 90 out of 100, respectively. IGN stated that “the story is rich and complex,” praising the character creation, open-ended game play, {{and size of the}} game world. They also praised the game for its responsiveness to the player: “A well-adjusted Elf may get more information out of an aristocrat than a surly Half-Ogre, and the conversations you have will be completely different.” IGN did, however, criticize its interface, calling it “not very intuitive, bordering on downright clunky” and the in-game user interface “takes up over a third of the screen.” Gamezone called it a RPG with “some extra bite,” also praising the character creation and game play stating, “This one will be <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>PC</b> for months.” Additionally, they praised the “incredible range of equipment that ranges from standards such as swords and armor to rags and coal and empty cans.” [...] I was pleasantly surprised that I could construct Molotov cocktailbombs from garbage. Insanely cool Gamezone review The game also received praise from The Electric Playground, which awarded the game 9 out of 10 and calling it [...] "the most diverse and open-ended RPG to date." [...] Game Revolution praised the game, particularly the character creation, stating, “Whomever you are, the world treats you accordingly.” but also criticized the graphics. Game Informer rated the game as 6.75 out of 10, GamePro gave it 4 out of 5 and Mygamer awarded the game 8 out of 10.|$|E
