25|$|War on Terror: Although R's {{contribution}} to the War <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> <b>is</b> highly classified, the organisation gained some attention in the Western media after claims that it was assisting the United States by providing intelligence on Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban's whereabouts. Maps and photographs of terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan along with other evidence implicating Osama bin Laden in terrorist attacks were given to US intelligence officials. RAW's role in the War on Terror may increase as US intelligence has indicated that it sees RAW as a more reliable ally than Pakistani intelligence. It has further come to light that a timely tip-off by RAW helped foil a third assassination plot against Pakistan's former President, General Pervez Musharraf.|$|E
2500|$|Following the September 11 {{attacks in}} 2001, President George W. Bush {{announced}} the War on Terrorism. The stated {{objective of the}} Global War <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> <b>is</b> [...] "the defeat of Al-Qaeda, other terrorist groups and any nation that supports or harbors terrorists". Since then, the Marine Corps, alongside other military and federal agencies, has engaged in global operations {{around the world in}} support of that mission.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007 Boyko Borisov {{was accused}} by the {{magazine}} U.S. Congressional Quarterly (CQ) of being {{directly linked to}} the biggest mobsters in Bulgaria. CQ asserted that, [...] "the most powerful politician in Bulgaria, Washington's newest ally in the global war <b>on</b> <b>terror,</b> <b>is</b> a close associate of known mobsters and linked to almost 30 unsolved murders in the Black Sea republic." [...] According to a confidential report compiled by former top U.S. law enforcement agency officials Borisov had used his position as the Chief Secretary of the Bulgarian Interior Ministry to help organized crime bosses attack their opponents.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. {{president}} Barack Obama and {{his administration}} (2009–2017) {{on a number of}} occasions expressly rejected the term [...] "War on Terror", as well as the qualifier global, as being inaccurate and misleading. President Barack Obama announced on 23 May 2013 that Global War <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> <b>is</b> over, saying the military and intelligence agencies will not wage war against a tactic but will instead focus on a specific group of networks determined to destroy the U.S. On 28 December 2014, the Obama administration announced the end of the combat role of the US-led mission in Afghanistan. However, with the unexpected rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant terror group earlier that year, new operation against terror in Middle East and South Asia was announced – the Operation Inherent Resolve.|$|E
2500|$|John Yoo, {{legal advisor}} to the Bush administration, has {{explicitly}} invoked Federalist No. 70 in his support for executive power over foreign policy. Referencing Hamilton, Yoo has claimed that [...] "the centralization of authority in the President is particularly crucial in matters of national defense, war, and foreign policy, where a unitary executive can evaluate threats, consider policy choices, and mobilize national resources with a speed and energy that is far superior to any other branch.” [...] Yoo has also cited Federalist No. 70 in his support of the President’s right to unilaterally conduct operations against terrorists without congressional consent. He claims that this power applies to operations against both individuals and states. At least one scholar has also argued that, because {{the president has the}} most access to national security information, only the president can know when the War <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> <b>is</b> over and no longer mandates an expansive executive authority.|$|E

2500|$|Others {{have also}} {{suggested}} that press coverage contributed to a public confused and misinformed on both the nature and level of {{the threat to the}} U.S. posed by terrorism. In his book, Trapped in the War on Terror political scientist Ian S. Lustick, claimed, [...] "The media have given constant attention to possible terrorist-initiated catastrophes and to the failures and weaknesses of the government's response." [...] Lustick alleged that the War <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> <b>is</b> disconnected from the real but remote threat terrorism poses and that the generalized War on Terror began as part of the justification for invading Iraq, but then took {{on a life of its}} own, fueled by media coverage. Scott Atran writes that [...] "publicity is the oxygen of terrorism" [...] and the rapid growth of international communicative networks renders publicity even more potent, with the result that [...] "perhaps never in the history of human conflict have so few people with so few actual means and capabilities frightened so many." ...|$|E
