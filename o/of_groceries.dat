5|$|No. 36 Squadron was {{particularly}} active during 2011. In January that year the squadron had to evacuate two C-17s from Amberley to Richmond when the base was threatened by rising floodwaters during the Queensland floods; {{of the other}} two Globemasters, one was in the Middle East and the other was undergoing maintenance and could not be flown. The aircraft stranded at Amberley was moved onto high ground during the crisis at the base and escaped without damage. The two Richmond-based C-17s subsequently flew over 227 tonnes of supplies to flood-affected regions of Queensland. When flooding also took place in Victoria during January, No. 36 Squadron transported 100,000 sandbags to Melbourne and flew Royal Australian Navy personnel and vehicles into the state from HMAS Albatross in New South Wales. No. 36 Squadron returned to Amberley after the flood waters dropped in mid-February. In early February the north Queensland city of Cairns was threatened by Cyclone Yasi, and the RAAF conducted two C-17 sorties and two C-130 sorties to evacuate patients from Cairns Base Hospital on the night of 1/2 February. After the cyclone passed over the Queensland coast, C-17s flew 200 tonnes <b>of</b> <b>groceries</b> into Cairns over a two-day period as part of Operation Yasi Assist. No. 36 Squadron also contributed aircraft to the Australian response to the 2011 Christchurch earthquake in late February, the C-17s flying urban search and rescue teams into the city from the 23rd of the month and evacuating Australian citizens on their return flights.|$|E

25|$|Methods {{that test}} {{prospective}} memory require {{the distinction between}} retrospective memory, which is remembering information, and prospective memory, which is remembering information for the future. Prospective memory requires retrospective memory because one must remember the information itself in order {{to act in the}} future. For example, remembering to buy groceries after work (prospective memory) requires the ability to remember what type <b>of</b> <b>groceries</b> are needed (retrospective memory). While prospective memory and retrospective memory are connected, they are distinguishable. This makes it possible to separate these two processes during tests.|$|E

25|$|Elbow (Humeroulnar joint) – The biceps brachii also {{functions}} {{as an important}} flexor of the forearm, particularly when the forearm is supinated. Functionally, this action is performed when lifting an object, such as a bag <b>of</b> <b>groceries</b> or when performing a biceps curl. When the forearm is in pronation (the palm faces the ground), the brachialis, brachioradialis, and supinator function to flex the forearm, with minimal contribution from the biceps brachii. It {{is also important to}} note that regardless of forearm position, (supinated, pronated, or neutral,) the force exerted by the biceps brachii remains the same; however, the brachioradialis has a much greater change in exertion depending on position than the biceps during concentric contractions. That is, the biceps can only exert so much force, and as forearm position changes, other muscles must compensate.|$|E
25|$|The SLA {{issued an}} {{ultimatum}} to the Hearst family: {{that they would}} release Patty {{in exchange for the}} freedom of Remiro and Little. When such an arrangement proved impossible, the SLA demanded a ransom, {{in the form of a}} food distribution program. The value of food to be distributed fluctuated: on February 23 the demand was for $4 million; it peaked at $400 million. Although free food was distributed, the operation was halted when violence erupted at one of the four distribution points. This happened because the crowds were much greater than expected, and people were injured as panicked workers threw boxes of food off moving trucks into the crowd. After the SLA demanded that a community coalition called the Western Addition Project Area Committee be put in charge of the food distribution, 100,000 bags <b>of</b> <b>groceries</b> were handed out at 16 locations across four counties between February 26 and the end of March.|$|E

500|$|Babb {{was born}} in 1906 in Lees Creek, Ohio, USA (near Wilmington). He earned the {{nickname}} [...] "Kroger" [...] either from his childhood job at the grocer {{of the same name}} or from his father's preference for B.H. Kroger coffee. Babb held a number of jobs during his youth, gaining a mention in Ripley's Believe It Or Not for refereeing a record number of youth sports games. He started out with jobs in sportswriting and reporting at a local newspaper in his 20s, and even showed signs of his later work while showcasing [...] "Digger" [...] O'Dell, the [...] "living corpse," [...] but first achieved success after his promotion to publicity manager for the Chakeres-Warners movie theaters, where he would create different kinds of stunts to lure audiences—for example, a drawing to award two bags <b>of</b> <b>groceries</b> to one ticket holder at selected theaters. Another gimmick was to find a furniture store window where a bedroom suite was on display, and there Babb would place a large sign reading [...] "Win a bedroom suit (theatre location & date listed)". [...] This always ensured a packed house, and the [...] "lucky" [...] winner was awarded with a pair of pajamas. [...] These experiences led him to the exploitation film business.|$|E

2500|$|The A Historical Society {{describes}} early stores as [...] "resplendent emporiums" [...] {{painted in}} vermilion and {{equipped with a}} large gas light T sign. Interiors included crystal chandeliers, tin ceilings, and walls with gilt-edged Chinese panels. A clerk stood behind a long counter to serve customers (self-service did not become common until the 1930s), and the cashier's station was shaped like a pagoda. When A started offering premiums, the wall opposite the counter was equipped with large shelves to display the giveaways. After John Hartford became responsible for marketing in the 1900s, A began offering S Green Stamps to free space for the expanded line <b>of</b> <b>groceries</b> available in the stores. The economy stores John Hartford developed in 1912 eliminated frills. Typically , these stores were equipped with basic shelving and a small ice box. A agreed only to short leases {{so that it could}} quickly close unprofitable stores.|$|E
