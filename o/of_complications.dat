40|$|Diabetes is a {{metabolic}} disorder affecting {{large percentage of}} population worldwide. NF-κβ plays key role in pathogenesis <b>of</b> vascular <b>complications</b> <b>of</b> diabetes. Persistent hyperglycemia activates NF-κβ that triggers expression of various cytokines, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules. Over-expression of TNF-α, interleukins, TGF-β, Bcl 2 and other pro-inflammatory proteins and pro-apoptotic genes by NF-κβ is key risk factor in vascular dysfunction. NF-κβ over-expression also triggers calcification of endothelial cells leading to endothelial dysfunction and further vascular <b>complications.</b> Inhibition <b>of</b> NF-κβ pro-inflammatory pathway is upcoming novel target for management <b>of</b> vascular <b>complications</b> <b>of</b> diabetes. Various natural and synthetic inhibitors of NF-κβ have been studied in management <b>of</b> diabetic <b>complications.</b> Recent preclinical and clinical studies validate NF-κβ as promising target in the management <b>of</b> vascular <b>complications</b> <b>of</b> diabetes...|$|R
