The interesting thing about {{this study is the}} text object, “singing” that should be preserved due to the nature that it is rich in aesthetic elements. Problems examined through children 2 ̆ 7 s song texts are (1) how aesthetic sound and (2) how is the meaning in the text of the song of children. Aesthetic sound and meaning are able to deepen the meaning and describe things that are spoken through the language of the song writer in order to touch feelings. The study was categorized as a qualitative study using descriptive analysis method. The research data {{is in the form of}} a children 2 ̆ 7 s song lyric taken from information of people. Data were analyzed based on the aesthetic elements that include a) rhyme, b) efoni, c) kakafoni, d) alliteration, e) assonance, f) anaphora, g) epifocal, h) onomatopoeic, and I) meaning. Based on the results of the study, the researcher found 5 data of rhyme beginning, 8 <b>data</b> <b>on</b> middle rhyme, 9 <b>data</b> <b>on</b> rhyme ending sequence, 10 <b>data</b> <b>on</b> rhyme late in pairs, 3 <b>data</b> <b>on</b> rhyme late intermittent, 3 <b>data</b> <b>on</b> the final rhyme hugged, 19 <b>data</b> <b>on</b> efoni 20 <b>Data</b> <b>on</b> kakafoni, 13 <b>data</b> <b>on</b> alliteration, 12 <b>data</b> <b>on</b> assonance, 5 <b>data</b> <b>on</b> anaphora, 8 <b>data</b> <b>on</b> epifocal, 4 <b>data</b> <b>on</b> onomatopoeic and 22 <b>data</b> <b>on</b> meaning (sentence connotation). The results of this study indicate that the essence of the aesthetic object is the ability to attract someone through beauty or ugliness. The results of this study are expected to have contributed to the development of science, particularly in researching of literary aesthetics...|$|R
