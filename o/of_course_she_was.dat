[...] "If Bessie had been old enough, {{she would have}} gone with him," [...] said Clarence's widow, Maud. [...] "That's why he left without telling her, but Clarence {{told me she was}} ready, even then. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> only a child." ...|$|E
2500|$|Natalie’s {{relationship}} with Barry Evans- frequently {{described as a}} “bumbling buffoon” – was central to the character upon her return to the serial. Speed has explained her character’s initial attraction to Barry: [...] "I think {{it has a lot}} to do with her childhood. Natalie really adored her dad but he couldn't put up with that horrible wife of his, Andrea… and so he walked out on the family. Andrea is a total nightmare control freak, and it says a lot about who Natalie is, why she had no confidence in herself. Her mother probably emotionally abused her. So Barry represented safety and a secure family environment…She feels safe with him and she felt she made the right choice at the time, although <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> apprehensive about it.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Accompanied by her {{daughter}} Valmai in America and Sir Les Patterson in the UK, Dame Edna again toured {{with what was}} declared My First Last Tour.

6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know, I {{never thought}} about it, but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> lovely and I'm plain, {{so there is no}} {{possibility}} of comparison between us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me, Serjeant, we {{acknowledge}} nothing. As a matter <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> the Countess till it be proved that another wife <b>was</b> living when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> married." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{thinking}} of Harry Merrycourt, {{but she was}} surprised by the answer.|$|E
60|$|And {{then she}} tried to extract confidences as to Mrs. Brownlow's {{intentions}} towards the child, in which <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> baffled.|$|E
6000|$|... "She says so; {{and says}} that she {{declared}} that ten thousand pounds would be the very lowest sum. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> laughing at him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a horrid {{old woman}} she is," [...] said Lily, {{as they rode}} back down the avenue. [...] "I beg your pardon, Bernard; for, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> your aunt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{would do}} it on the {{slightest}} hope that such giving would have any tendency that way. Her philanthropy <b>is</b> all real. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a bore to you." ...|$|R
50|$|Having Lilah Morgan send {{presents}} {{was a good}} idea. Lilah sends Christmas {{presents to}} all, but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not playing nice - it's a ploy to test their resolve.|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very, very young, {{but already}} from {{him she had}} {{realized}} {{that it is impossible}} even to regenerate mankind and give it political and religious freedom without the help of money.|$|E
6000|$|Susan {{thought that}} here {{were a very}} serious number of words, and begged hard for leave to leave out her sorrow. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sorry, {{but what was the}} use of telling Ida so? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I were a man," [...] she said, [...] "I {{think women}} have much {{the worst time}} in the war. Is your mother old?" [...] But <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> old why he was old himself! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must win}} it, <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> to be won, {{like any other}} woman. The fruit won't fall into your mouth merely because you open your lips. You must climb the tree." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I hope I shall {{find you}} so,--always. And, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> ridiculous--in your eyes. I {{have learned to}} see it, and to regret it; but I shall never cease to love her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When she {{was told}} of all {{that he had to}} give in the way of wealth and rank, she took the bit between her teeth and would not be turned an inch. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in love." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{asked to}} come in, and thus they met, the quick, slim, active little spinster, whose whole life had been work, and the far younger widow, whose {{vocation}} had been chiefly home-making. Their first silent impressions were—- ...|$|E
60|$|Jerry {{took the}} little one to Nellie Ardell's apartments. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> much surprised, and, sitting down, our hero had to explain {{everything}} {{as far as he}} was able. Nellie Ardell agreed instantly to take the little girl in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Billina, [...] "I {{must find}} Ozma. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> {{sure to be}} here, somewhere, and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> green, being from Oz. So look around, you stupid soldiers, and help me in my search." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is pretty, Mellor," [...] another broke in; [...] "I {{caught a}} glimpse of her, and <b>she</b> <b>is</b> as pretty a girl as I have seen in the colony, though, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> looking utterly worn out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “And, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> quite old,” {{said the}} Baroness; “I wish I {{had given her}} notice some weeks ago, then she would have left before this {{happened}} to her. Why, Wappi, what is the matter with you?” ...|$|R
6000|$|This, {{with the}} way he dropped it, again {{considerably}} moved her--made her feel for a moment that, as a matter <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a subject for disclosures. But she quickly found her answer. [...] "Oh, as for that, you must ask her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was because}} they whirl so fast," [...] the Wizard explained. [...] "Scraps had nothing to hold on to, and so <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> tossed from one hill to another. I'm afraid we shall never see the poor Patchwork Girl again." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{knew her}} power <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> a near kinswoman of the Emperor, {{and the child}} of his adoption; she was all-powerful with the Cæsar as with all men through the might of his {{personality}} as much as through that of her wealth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down, little one," [...] she said. [...] "I {{will draw}} some tea, while Sid attends to the luggage. My pretty {{butterfly}} must be warmed after her drive; for <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> to outshine all beauties {{at the ball}} to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Archibald," [...] {{said his}} wife, [...] "you never can {{remember}} that in this world {{people of all ages}} grow older. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> fourteen when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> visiting us, and that was four years ago, so <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a young lady." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite well, thank you. But as {{a matter}} <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> very anxious about this affair. She had read what has been said in the newspapers, {{and it may be}} {{necessary}} that Mortimer should take it up, as the family solicitor." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> right, but Deane felt {{a little}} unhinged. Her invulnerability was maddening. [...] "Perhaps not," [...] he answered.

6000|$|... "Sometimes girls can't. They don't know themselves; {{they think}} they're in love when they're not.

But at last she found that she couldn't bear it, {{and she had to}} tell him so." ...|$|E
6000|$|Rufus {{expressed}} {{his opinion of}} the wisdom of putting this question with his customary plainness of language. [...] "When there's a rash thing {{to be done by}} {{a man and a woman}} together, sir, philosophers have remarked that it's always the woman who leads the way. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sybil Caroom," [...] he said, softly. [...] "She {{is a very}} charming girl. You {{would like}} her, I <b>am</b> sure. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she's</b> <b>been</b> brought up in rather a {{frivolous}} world, but she's quite unspoilt, very sympathetic, and very intelligent. Isn't that a good character?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Grant {{would be}} quite prudent in {{thinking}} of it and {{like the rest of}} the world. Her husband was only a regimental officer in India who got knighted for doing something that came in his way. There isn't any family property among them, and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> anxious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{ought to}} be. Speaking very seriously, I {{mean that it}} ought to <b>be</b> a matter <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> {{everything}} that a man should desire in a wife. I am not alluding now to her rank, though <b>of</b> <b>course</b> you feel what a great advantage she gives you in this respect." ...|$|R
