500|$|None <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>did</b> [...] It was just, you know, it's very conceptual. We {{basically}} {{gave the}} song {{to the two}} French directors [...] and {{they came up with}} the only concept that I thought was interesting, with this black sort of amorphous graphic line slowly eating up the world. I just liked that as a concept.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} less {{favorable}} reviews of [...] "You Have 0 Friends" [...] that criticize the use of its cultural Facebook jokes. TV Fanatic, who gave the episode 3/5, said there was [...] "too much Facebook" [...] in the episode and that [...] "it was a great parody, but just a decent episode that could have had more LOL moments". Grading it a D+, The A.V. Club's Todd VanDerWerff opined the episode [...] "mostly made all of the jokes about [...] that the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>did</b> back when Facebook first invaded all of our lives. It doesn't give me high hopes for the inevitable Twitter episode the show does in 2013." ...|$|E
500|$|Tynan {{remarked to}} Olivier, [...] "you aren't really a contemplative or {{philosophical}} actor"; Olivier {{was known for}} the strenuous physicality of his performances in some roles. He told Tynan this {{was because he was}} influenced as a young man by Douglas Fairbanks, Ramon Navarro and John Barrymore in films, and Barrymore on stage as Hamlet: [...] "tremendously athletic. I admired that greatly, all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>did....</b> One thought of oneself, idiotically, skinny as I was, as a sort of Tarzan." [...] According to Morley, Gielgud was widely considered [...] "the best actor in the world from the neck up and Olivier from the neck down." [...] Olivier described the contrast thus: [...] "I've always thought that we were the reverses of the same coin... the top half John, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity." ...|$|E

500|$|Aspinall later commented {{about his}} first meeting with George Harrison, who also {{attended}} the Liverpool Institute: [...] "My first encounter with George was behind the school’s air-raid shelters. [...] This great mass of shaggy hair loomed up and an out-of-breath voice requested a quick drag of my Woodbine. It {{was one of the first}} cigarettes either of us had smoked. We spluttered our way through it bravely but gleefully. After that the three <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>did</b> lots of ridiculous things together.... By the time we were ready to take the GCE exams we added John Lennon to our 'Mad Lad' gang. He was doing his first term at Liverpool College of Art which overlooks the Liverpool Institute playground and we all got together in a students coffee bar at lunchtime." [...] Aspinall took nine GCEs at the Institute and passed eight of them, but failed the French exam. He left school in July 1959, and studied accountancy. [...] Aspinall worked for a Liverpool company for two years, receiving a wage of £2-10s–0d. (£2.50 decimal equivalent) per week as a trainee accountant.|$|E
500|$|Lee was a {{character}} actor and acting instructor {{with a range}} of roles in the theater and who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy era. [...] According to writer Michael Davis, Lee played Mr. Hooper, known for his bowtie and hornrimmed glasses, [...] "with such certainty and naturalness he made adults suspend their sense of disbelief". [...] Writer Louise A. Gikow stated that Lee was [...] "perfectly cast" [...] as Mr. Hooper. [...] According to fellow cast member Bob McGrath, who also appeared in Sesame Streets first episode with Lee, [...] "Will had a broader dimension to his character than perhaps the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>did...</b> He convinced me that no matter how simple the scene was with a child, you had to bring a tremendous integrity and an honesty and credibility to it". [...] Joan Ganz Cooney, Sesame Street co-creator and president of the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), said, [...] "He gave millions of children the message that the old and the young have a lot to say to each other". [...] The New York Times reported that Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers.|$|E
500|$|... "She is enigmatic but I {{must tell}} you I never had a bad {{experience}} because of her enigma. What it was, she explained this once, is that she did this on purpose. The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>did</b> because we were together so much. So in that sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group. At least twice a year Larry Hagman and I would go up to Canada – fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that. Steve Kanaly was included in that group, and we would go up together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and Linda Gray was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela. But the times we were together on the set, waiting for scenes to be shot, in the make-up room and everything, it was nothing but convivial." ...|$|E

2500|$|Perkins never {{attained}} the stardom of Presley, who, {{according to}} Perkins, [...] "had everything. He had the looks, the moves, the manager, and the talent. And he didn't look like Mr. Ed, {{like a lot}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>did,</b> Elvis was hitting them with sideburns, flashy clothes, and no ring on the finger. I had three kids." [...] After Presley hit the chart with his version of [...] "Blue Suede Shoes," [...] Perkins became known more for his songwriting than for his performing.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the third}} anniversary of Bethany's disappearance, Nelson {{challenged}} Roldan {{to take a}} lie detector test. [...] "I {{would like to hear}} what happened," [...] she told Washington-area news radio station WTOP-FM. [...] "I'd like him to join the polygraph list like the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>did.</b> If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about." [...] Geloo in response repeated that Roldan had answered all questions he was asked during the original investigation and was innocent of any crime that may have been committed.|$|E
2500|$|Many years later, {{when asked}} in a {{television}} interview by CNN correspondent Paula Zahn what [...] "the whole world [...] understand about women's efforts" [...] in World War II, Dr. Putney replied: [...] "They should understand [...] [...] [...] that we were a mighty support force for the male armed forces. [...] I've got to say male because many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>did</b> all of the tasks, all of the [...] [...] [...] military occupational specialties, as a man, except carry a gun." [...] Interviewed on another occasion, she said: [...] "It is my thesis that military integration made {{the basis for the}} emergence and the expansion of the black middle class." ...|$|E

Dead or married, the man who can drink whisky-and-soda must be held responsible for his actions. What's the little beggar mean by cutting us all in this way?

6000|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>did</b> not hear of this death till months afterwards--from Schomberg, who disliked Heyst gratuitously and made {{up a piece of}} {{sinister}} whispered gossip: ...|$|E

6000|$|The rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>did</b> {{not share}} the Story Girl's enthusiasm {{regarding}} our call on Mr. Campbell. We secretly dreaded it. If, as was said, he detested children, who knew what sort of a reception we might meet? ...|$|E
