5|$|Fifty animators worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> {{which the}} castle is built, and one frame {{required}} 30 hours to render. They later extended similar techniques to Elsa's clothing. While the traditional Norwegian rosemaling was {{the inspiration for}} her costuming early in the film, her ice gown was designed similarly to her palace, with snowflakes heavily influencing the style. Her cape itself is a large snowflake.|$|E
5|$|The castles {{guarding}} the northern border were in such bad condition that the Knights easily captured those at Złotoryja, Dobrzyń and Bobrowniki, {{the capital of}} Dobrzyń Land, while German burghers invited them into Bydgoszcz (German: Bromberg). Władysław arrived <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> late September, retook Bydgoszcz within a week, and came {{to terms with the}} Order on 8 October. During the winter, the two armies prepared for a major confrontation. Władysław installed a strategic supply depot at Płock in Masovia and had a pontoon bridge constructed and transported north down the Vistula.|$|E

5|$|Theramenes was {{a central}} figure in four major episodes of Athenian history. He {{appeared}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> 411 BC {{as one of the}} leaders of an oligarchic coup, but, as his views and those of the coup's other leaders diverged, he began to oppose their dictates and took the lead in replacing the narrow oligarchy they had imposed with a more broadly based one. He served as a general for several years after this, but was not reelected to that office in 407 BC. After the Battle of Arginusae, in which he served as a trierarch, he was assigned to rescue Athenian sailors from sinking ships, but was prevented from doing so by a storm. That incident prompted a massive furore at Athens, in which Theramenes had to exonerate himself from responsibility for the failed rescue; the controversy ended in the execution of six generals who had commanded at that battle. After the Athenian defeat at Aegospotami in 405 BC, Theramenes arranged the terms by which Athens surrendered to Sparta. He then became a member of the narrow oligarchic government, known as the Thirty Tyrants, that Sparta imposed on its defeated rival. As he had in 411 BC, Theramenes soon came into conflict with the more extreme members of that government; his protests against the reign of terror the Thirty implemented led the leading oligarchs to plot his demise; he was denounced before the oligarchic assembly, and then, when that body appeared reluctant to punish him, struck him from the roster of citizens and executed him without trial.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{southern}} Afghanistan {{was neither}} {{under the control}} of foreign-backed militias nor the government in Kabul, but was ruled by local leaders such as Gul Agha Sherzai and their militias.

He played at Chester Boughton Hall Cricket Club in the highly rated Liverpool Competition and finished the season with 106 wickets at an average of 7.57, a best of 8-20 and five or more wickets on eleven occasions. Chester Boughton Hall finished the season as champions.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 31 August 1939 {{a small group of}} German operatives, dressed in Polish uniforms and led by Alfred Naujocks, seized the Gleiwitz station and {{broadcast}} a short anti-German message in Polish (sources vary on the content of the message). Several prisoners (most likely from the Dachau concentration camp) and a local Polish-Silesian activist (arrested a day before) were left dead <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> Polish uniforms.|$|E
25|$|Despite McPherson's victory, the {{presence}} of Confederate forces attacking Grant's right flank caused him to reconsider his plan. He learned that Gen. Joseph E. Johnston was due in Jackson with reinforcements within {{the next couple of}} days, and there was a rumor that Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard would also arrive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> <b>In</b> this situation, the Union army would be between enemy forces on each flank. Therefore, he chose to deal with the threat from the east first and ordered Sherman and McPherson to seize Jackson.|$|E

25|$|Another new England coach came <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> Glenn Hoddle and Ince {{kept his}} {{place for the}} next six internationals, which {{included}} five crucial qualifiers for the 1998 World Cup in France. England won four of them but lost 1–0 at home to Italy. During the first of these qualifiers against Moldova in Chişinău, a famous photograph of Ince was taken as he tried to climb a wall at the stadium, only for Gascoigne to pull his tracksuit trousers down, revealing Ince's bare buttocks in front of an army of cameras.|$|E
25|$|It {{is strange}} {{to look back}} and see how this frail-looking young man burst <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> 1953. We had sent Ken Joy, the former BBAR, to {{challenge}} for the Grand Prix des Nations, then 140 kilometres long, and dragging through the hills of the Chevreuse valley. All over Paris they talked about this burly Englishman who had ridden 160km in 4 hours and 6 minutes: and when it came to it, he was hammered by a 19-year-old, but a teenager with a will of iron that was to prove inflexible for the next 19 years.|$|E
25|$|Tom van Vollenhoven the brush-cut wing who {{appeared}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> 1955, {{was the kind}} of player who captured the imagination every time he touched the ball. His try for the Light Blues against the Junior Springboks in 1955, when he beat one player after another in spectacular a zigzag run of almost 80 metres, is still lauded as the try of all tries. This got him into the Springbok side against the 1955 British Lions of Robin Thomson and in the second test scored a hat trick of tries. He would probably {{have been one of the}} greatest heroes if he had not gone off to play professional rugby league in England so early in his career.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} {{who would later}} become the Yellow Kid first appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> a minor supporting role in cartoon panel published in Truth magazine in 1894 and 1895. The four different black-and-white single panel cartoons were deemed popular, and one of them, Fourth Ward Brownies, was reprinted on 17 February 1895 in Joseph Pulitzer's New York World, where Outcault worked as a technical drawing artist. The World published another, newer Hogan's Alley cartoon {{less than a month}} later, and this was followed by the strip's first color printing on 5 May 1895. Hogan's Alley gradually became a full-page Sunday color cartoon with the Yellow Kid (who was also appearing several times a week) as its lead character.|$|E
25|$|The book of Samuel records Hannah's {{prayer to}} God. She rejoices and exalts the Holy One {{there is no}} father like God, therefore, the nation should rejoice also in this Holy One. This story of Hannah intertwines itself with {{the culture of the}} nation of Israel. Eli is the high priest (kohen gadol) of Shiloh, the second-to-last Israelite judge (succeeded only by Samuel - see 1 Samuel 7:15) before the rule of the kings, therefore, the Shiloh {{tradition}} will become an old and lost tradition that when the prophet Jeremiah comes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> the history of God's people, he will seek to renew and to bring back the way of the Shiloh tradition to the people of Israel because the kings have become wicked defiling the temple and tradition of God.|$|E
25|$|The public's {{concern about}} {{the federal budget deficit}} and fears of {{professional}} politicians allowed the independent candidacy of billionaire Texan Ross Perot to explode <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> dramatic fashion—at one point Perot was leading the major party candidates in the polls. Perot crusaded against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and internal and external national debt, tapping into voters' potential fear of the deficit. His volunteers succeeded in collecting enough signatures to get his name on the ballot in all 50 states. In June, Perot led the national public opinion polls with support from 39% of the voters (versus 31% for Bush and 25% for Clinton). Perot severely damaged his credibility by dropping out of the presidential contest in July and remaining out of the race for several weeks before re-entering. He compounded this damage by eventually claiming, without evidence, that his withdrawal was due to Republican operatives attempting to disrupt his daughter's wedding.|$|E
