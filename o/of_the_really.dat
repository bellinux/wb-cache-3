[...] "I am now convinced," [...] he wrote, [...] "that the very special circumstances arising from the nature of the project, and of its organization, demand special treatment, and a report of this kind may well be necessary to maintain security <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>really</b> essential facts of the project." ...|$|E

Before the airing of the episode, {{it was confirmed that}} actress Molly Shannon would guest star as Val, a new neighbor in Will and Grace's apartment building. This episode would be Shannon's first appearance on the show, with her later guest starring in the episodes [...] "Girls, Interrupted", [...] "Last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Really</b> Odd Lovers", [...] "Fagel Attraction", and [...] "One Gay at a Time".|$|E

IGN's Casamassina found the music [...] "very well executed" [...] and [...] "very entertaining", likening it to [...] "'futuristic space pop' and elevator-like tunes", and named the sound effects [...] "equally satisfying". Conversely, Electronic Gaming Monthlys Hsu found the music [...] "ultra-annoying". For the PlayStation version of the game, in which the {{original}} music is replaced, John Szczepaniak of Hardcore Gaming 101 said that it [...] "sucks", writing that [...] "the elevator style music is made even more obnoxious, and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>really</b> good tunes ... have been replaced with awful generic heavy metal".|$|E

500|$|Bond {{wrote of}} her next role, [...] "It {{was like a}} dream come true when I saw my own name in the title role" [...] of Iolanthe (1882–84). Bond's first {{entrance}} as Iolanthe was across a [...] "stream". [...] She wrote in her memoirs about a performance of Iolanthe: [...] "Realism can be carried too far, as it was when one night a zealous property man said to me: 'It'll be just like the real thing to-night, Miss Bond. I've put some frogs into the water!' [...] 'Then you'll just have to fish them out again,' I retorted, 'and the curtain won't go up until you do.' [...] They had to catch those frogs in an inverted umbrella. [...] Everybody got splashed and agitated, and the performance was delayed for some time." [...] The critics praised Bond's portrayal of the title character: [...] "Miss Jessie Bond... may be credited with all the grace, delicacy, and fascination we should expect from a fairy mother, and her singing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>really</b> exquisite melody in the last scene {{was one of the most}} successful items in the entire opera." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first of}} these was Daredevil (2003), in which Affleck starred as the blind superhero. Affleck was a {{longtime}} comic book fan, and had written a foreword for Kevin Smith's Guardian Devil (1999) about his love for the character of Daredevil. The film was a commercial success, but received a mixed response from critics. Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times said Affleck was [...] "lost" [...] in the role: [...] "A big man, Mr. Affleck is shriveled by the one-dimensional role ... a playful side that allows Mr. Affleck to show his generosity as an actor." [...] In 2014, Affleck described Daredevil as the only film he regretted making. He next appeared as a low-ranking mobster in the romantic comedy Gigli (2003), co-starring Lopez. The film was almost uniformly panned, with Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times remarking that [...] "Affleck doesn't have the chops or the charm to maneuver around (or past) bad material." [...] Yet Affleck has repeatedly defended director Marty Brest since the film's release, describing him as [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>really</b> great directors". In his last film role of 2003, Affleck starred as a reverse engineer in the sci-fi thriller Paycheck (2003). Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian remarked on Affleck's [...] "self-deprecating charm" [...] and wondered why {{he could not find}} better scripts. Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times found it [...] "almost unfair" [...] to critique Affleck, given that he [...] "had such a rough year".|$|E

And employers, bound in part by Treasury Department regulations, do not vary deductibles, catastrophic caps or contributions to HSAs and HRAs to workers' family incomes or health status as equitable CDHC would call for....Many things we buy in health care are pieces of larger packages which are undefined when the decisions are made concerning whether to purchase and where to purchase. For example, when one goes to the doctor because of a particular set of symptoms, the doctor ask a number of questions which leads to a series of recommended tests whose results then determine an appropriate treatment regime. One could select the doctor to visit on the basis of price and quality but that is no guarantee that the package of tests and treatments that resulted would be the lowest cost or highest quality....The costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>really</b> expensive treatments would be largely unaffected." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{explained}} his particular ethos {{and style of}} management of CSIRO in this way: Well, I suppose I always wanted to extrapolate from my own experience, small-scale experience, and some personal opinions. I had a strong desire always to see pure and applied research undertaken {{side by side in}} the same laboratory.... And I was still very much aware that the recognition that many – most, I should say – <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>really</b> important and fundamental discoveries in science which subsequently led to a massive technological development have come through curiosity-led research, and often through serendipity, which is terribly important. I think the Birch report was very helpful, and I agreed with his report that the whole core of the policy-making in the science that we were going to carry out was a matter of defining the right proportion of, shall we say, pure research, strategic mission-oriented, and technical research – and getting that proportion right.... I felt that fundamental research in the end was going to reap the real benefits in the long run ... discovering something like electricity ... was absolutely fundamental research and had an enormous impact on the world. On the other hand, there was the awareness that you're in charge of an organisation that's spending a million dollars of taxpayers' money every day, and that's a very sobering thought, so you had to keep the reins on as well. Indeed, there were many frustrations in being CSIRO's Chairman at that time, of which he nominated as the worst [...] "the frustration of finding it so difficult to bring in new young blood because of the descending budget in real terms." ...|$|E
