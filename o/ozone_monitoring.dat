5000|$|The ozone {{molecule}} absorbs ultraviolet radiation, {{and most}} <b>ozone</b> <b>monitors</b> utilized in regulatory applications use ultraviolet absorption to accurately quantify ozone levels. An <b>ozone</b> <b>monitor</b> {{of this type}} operates by pulling an air sample from the atmosphere into the machine with an air pump. [...] During one cycle, the <b>ozone</b> <b>monitor</b> will take one air sample through the air inlet, and scrub the ozone from the air; for the next cycle, an air sample bypasses the scrubber and the ozone value calculated. The solenoid valve is electronically activated to shift the air flow either through the scrubber or to bypass it on a timed sequence. The {{difference between the two}} sampled values determines the actual ozone value at that time. The monitor may also have options to account for air pressure and air temperature to calculate the value of ozone.|$|R

40|$|A new {{ambient air}} monitor, the Measurement of Ozone Production Sensor (MOPS), {{measures}} directly {{the rate of}} ozone production in the atmosphere. The sensor consists of two 11. 3 L environmental chambers made of UV-transmitting Teflon film, a unit to convert NO 2 to O 3, and a modified <b>ozone</b> <b>monitor.</b> In the sample chamber, flowing ambient air is exposed to the sunlight so that ozone is produced {{just as it is}} in the atmosphere. In the second chamber, called the reference chamber, a UV-blocking film over the Teflon film prevents ozone formation but allows other processes to occur as they do in the sample chamber. The air flows that exit the two chambers are sampled by an <b>ozone</b> <b>monitor</b> operating in differential mode so that the difference between the two ozone signals, divided by the exposure time in the chambers, gives the ozone production rate.
