[...] Originally the producers drew lines on Adams' hands to make them appear older, but later decided they didn't look old enough and added fake hands. [...] Once all was said and done, only the palms of Adams' hands and her upper lip were visible. [...] After begging and pleading with the DS9 staff to see the dailies, Adams realized how much she needed to overexpress to have her facial expressions translate through the makeup. [...] When she came back to DS9 for 's [...] "The Magnificent Ferengi", Adams agreed on the condition she receive her own custom faceplate. [...] Adams praised the other DS9 actors who suffered through similar makeup ordeals saying, [...] "I think it's astonishing that they were all in good cheer, and to be in the makeup all the time is really something." [...] Because Ishka is flouting Ferengi law by wearing clothes, it was decided that she would <b>overdo</b> <b>it,</b> and so Adams was encumbered with [...] "baubles and bangles and beads" [...] that made so much noise on set that Adams estimated she had to loop half her lines. [...] For [...] "Profit and Lace", where Ishka was to leave the Ferengi homeworld of Ferenginar for the first time, Adams was dressed in a [...] "Spandex suit from [...] wrists to the tip of [...] toes". [...] Further, because Ishka was old, the staff padded Adams' costume with , including fake breasts that Adams guessed weighed after watching the dailies, both Adams and Behr agreed that the breasts needed to be reduced as they were too distracting. [...] Adams would later thank both director René Auberjonois and co-star Armin Shimerman for helping her realize that overacting {{was the name of the}} game when working under such protheses.|$|E

40|$|Alan Wearne's "The Lovemakers" is a {{book about}} <b>overdoing</b> <b>it.</b> Its {{characters}} have unwise love affairs, dream foolish dreams, drink too much, engage in criminal activity, amass (and lose) vast wealth, and talk incessantly (usually about themselves). Wearne’s characters usually deal with obsession and with the places you get to in life if you overdo things. Few characters in this second part of Wearne’s epic verse novel age gracefully, and some don’t get to age at all. But "The Lovemakers" isn’t just about <b>overdoing</b> it: <b>it</b> performs <b>overdoing</b> <b>it.</b> Wearne’s aesthetic is one of excess, of conspicuous idiosyncrasy. Part of its excessiveness and oddity is its oxymoronic status. Wearne’s books are simultaneously poetic and prosy, realistic and outré, stylistically heterogeneous and tonally homogenous...|$|R
