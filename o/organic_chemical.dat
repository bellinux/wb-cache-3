5|$|Dopamine (DA, a {{contraction}} of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is an <b>organic</b> <b>chemical</b> of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays several {{important roles in}} the brain and body. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA, which is synthesized {{in the brain and}} kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{molecules}} exist in interstellar space, as can tiny 0.1μm dust particles. The tally of molecules discovered through radio astronomy is steadily increasing {{at the rate}} of about four new species per year. Large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the trihydrogen cation. An ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant carbon monoxide to produce ionized carbon, which in turn can lead to <b>organic</b> <b>chemical</b> reactions.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An <b>organic</b> <b>chemical</b> compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{strategy}} is proposed to predict physical properties, partitioning, bioconcentration and degradability of nonionized, nonpolymeric <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals.</b> The strategy uses structural features of <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals,</b> structure activity relationships, sequenced estimation techniques (including recently developed computerized methods), and laboratory screening tests. The cost {{to use this}} {{strategy is}} compared {{with the cost of}} conducting a standard menu of tests to measure physical properties, partitioning, bioconcentration and degradability. This chapter proposes a strategy for using structural features of <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals,</b> structure activity relationships, sequenced estimation techniques (including some recently developed computerized methods) and laboratory screening tests to predict the chemical fate of nonionized, nonpolymeric <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> (figure 13 - 1).

40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} current state of {{knowledge}} on the rejection of emerging trace <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> by forward osmosis (FO) processes, beginning with a brief introduction to the occurrence of emerging trace <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> in municipal wastewater effluent. Due to the frequent detection of emerging <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> in secondary treated effluent, a multibarrier concept is widely utilized in the design of wastewater reclamation processes to ensure the quality of product water. The chapter outlines three major aspects to delineate how they affect rejection of trace organic chemicals; process parameters include properties of membrane and draw solution and operating conditions, membrane fouling, and FO-based hybrid processes. Potential benefits of the FO-based hybrid systems extend beyond better product water quality and energy and cost savings. The chapter ends with several concluding remarks that strengthen the potential of FO in effectively dealing with emerging trace <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals...</b>|$|R

25|$|Acetaldehyde (systematic name ethanal) is an <b>organic</b> <b>chemical</b> {{compound}} {{with the}} formula CH3CHO, sometimes abbreviated by chemists as MeCHO (Me = methyl). It {{is one of}} the most important aldehydes, occurring widely in nature and being produced on a large scale in industry. Acetaldehyde occurs naturally in coffee, bread, and ripe fruit, and is produced by plants. It is also produced by the partial oxidation of ethanol by the liver enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and may be a contributing factor to hangovers from alcohol consumption. Pathways of exposure include air, water, land, or groundwater, as well as drink and smoke. Consumption of disulfiram inhibits acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of acetaldehyde, thereby causing it to build up in the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{amount of}} Bửu Hội's contributions {{are in the}} field of chemical carcinogenesis and the synthesis of related <b>organic</b> <b>chemical</b> compounds. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he had extensive collaborations with the quantum chemistry personnel of the Radium Institute on various aspects of the electronic theory of carcinogenesis. Bửu Hội was the first to propose the involvement of noncovalent forces. Together with Lacassagne and Rudali, in the 1940s he became the first to describe the phenomena of synergisma and antagonism between carcinogens. He demonstrated this by using hydrocarbons on the skin of mice and later extended this to hepatic and other carcinogens. Starting in 1947, he collaborated with François Zajdela and Lacassagne in exploring the relationships between the structure and carcinogenic activity of polynuclear compounds. The study spanned a groundbreaking scale and depth.|$|E

40|$|Porous resins {{have been}} used to sorb organic {{residues}} in industrial wastewaters for over four decades. A survey of literature revealed that these resins have surface areas up to 1500 m 2 /g, and may be tailor made to selectively sorb certain groups of <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Resins may be regenerated, upon saturation, on site at ambient temperature by solvent elution, or by other means such as pH adjustment, microwave, or steam. The <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> are desorbed from the resin, during regeneration, and may be recovered for reuse. This paper reviews literature related to the applications of these porous resin sorbents for the removal and recovery of <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> from wastewater, their syntheses and physicochemical properties, as well as their sorption characteristics and mechanisms.

40|$|A {{protocol}} {{to validate the}} rejection of <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> of potential health risk by low pressure reverse osmosis (LPRO) membranes was developed for decision making support regarding the monitoring level required for potable water reuse. Ten <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> were selected for evaluation, based on their recorded usage, the scarcity of rejection data, and difficulty in analytical determination at concentrations relevant to their potential impact on human-health. An analytical method was developed for these <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals.</b> The target rejections of 90 and 99 % for neutral and charged chemicals respectively were successfully achieved under the standard operating condition with only two exceptions (i. e. bisoprolol and carazolol rejections by the TFC-HR membrane). These lower rejections by the TFC-HR {{can be attributed to}} its highestwater permeability amongst the three membranes while both bisoprolol and carazolol are positively charged. Changes in operating conditions including permeate flux, feed temperature and chemical cleaning can exert a considerable impact on conductivity rejection by the three LPRO membranes investigated here. Feed temperature showed an apparent impact on the rejection of the selected <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals.</b> However, their rejections were still higher than the target validation values. The protocol developed here can be expanded for the validation of other <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals...</b>|$|R

25|$|The term biosolids {{is used to}} {{differentiate}} treated sewage sludge that can be beneficially recycled. Environmental advantages of sewage sludge consist of, application of sludge to land due to its soil condition properties and nutrient content. Advantages also extend to reduction in adverse health effects of incineration, decreased chemical fertilizer dependency, diminishing greenhouse gas emissions deriving from incineration and reduction in incineration fuel and energy costs. Beneficial reuse of sewage sludge is supported in EPA policies: the 1984 Beneficial Reuse Policy and the 1991 Inter-agency Policy on Beneficial Use of Sewage Sludge, with an objective to reduce volumes of waste generated. Sewage sludge contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus but also contains significant numbers of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and eggs of parasitic worms. Sludge also contains more than trace amounts of organic and inorganic chemicals. Benefits of reusing sewage sludge from use of organic and nutrient content in biosolids is valuable source in improving marginal lands and serving as supplements to fertilizers and soil conditioners. Extension of benefits of sludge on agriculture commodities include increase forest productivity, accelerated tree growth, re-vegetation of forest land previously devastated by natural disasters or construction activities. Also, sewage sludge use to aid growth of final vegetative cap for municipal solid waste landfills is enormously beneficial. Opposing benefits of sludge water result from high levels of pathogenic organisms that can possibly contaminate soil, water, crops, livestock, and fish. Pathogens, metals, <b>organic</b> <b>chemical</b> content and odors are cause of major health, environmental and aesthetic factors. Sludge treatment processes reduce the level of pathogens which becomes important when applying sludge to land as well as distributing and marketing it. Pollutants of sewage sludge come from domestic wastewater, discharge of industrial wastewater, municipal sewers and also from runoffs from parking lots, lawns and fields that were applied fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides.|$|E
