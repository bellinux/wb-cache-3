The aim of the article is to assess the role of infrastructure potential <b>of</b> the <b>financial</b> market in ensuring its flexibility and security. Threats to the financial market security are systematized by sources of formation, scale, duration and nature of influence. The essence of security and flexibility <b>of</b> the <b>financial</b> market is defined. There systematized indicators of security and flexibility <b>of</b> the <b>financial</b> market in interrelation with the components of infrastructure potential <b>of</b> the <b>financial</b> market. The methodology for determining the level of economic safety and flexibility <b>of</b> the <b>financial</b> market is substantiated, the corresponding calculations are made. Also the methodology for calculating the normalized index of the infrastructure potential <b>of</b> the <b>financial</b> market is developed. The correlation-regression analysis {{of the connection between}} development of the infrastructure potential <b>of</b> the <b>financial</b> market, its security and flexibility is carried out. The results of the calculations showed that the degree of implementation <b>of</b> the <b>financial</b> market infrastructure potential at the current stage of development of the Ukrainian economy is insufficient. It does not contribute to achieving the necessary level of flexibility and security <b>of</b> the <b>financial</b> market. Each <b>of</b> the components of infrastructure potential requires changing approaches to regulation aimed at ensuring the systematic development <b>of</b> the <b>financial</b> market. Most <b>of</b> the identified problems are mainly related to dysfunctionality of the technological and information components of the infrastructural potential <b>of</b> the <b>financial</b> market. This is manifested in the low level of confidence in it from the part of the household sector {{as well as in the}} poor efficiency of regulation of certain segments <b>of</b> the <b>financial</b> market. That is why the prospects for further research are to identify areas for increasing the role of technological and information components of the infrastructure potential <b>of</b> the <b>financial</b> market...|$|R
