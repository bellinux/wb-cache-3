5|$|The University of Colorado's School <b>of</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> (SOP) {{began in}} 1911 as a {{division}} of the School of Medicine in Boulder. It became an independent college in 1913 and a school in 1957. It received its accreditation in 1938–1939 and awarded a B.S. in Pharmacy degree in 1995–1996 when it received a full accreditation status awarding the Doctor <b>of</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> (PharmD) degree by the ACPE. In 1986, the School <b>of</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> was administratively transferred to the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver. The physical transfer from Boulder and final consolidation of faculty, staff and students was completed between August and November 1992. In 2008, the school moved to the Anschutz Medical Campus, and offers medical and graduate degrees in pharmacy, the pharmaceutical sciences, molecular toxicology, and pharmaceutical outcomes research. 30% of its class is from out of state. In 2009, the NIH awarded $7,310,389 and $19,189,543 in grants towards the SOP and Pharmacology department, respectively. In 2011, the school will move into its new building, the Skaggs School <b>of</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> and Pharmaceutical Sciences which will also be located on the Anschutz Medical Campus.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the impact of the {{deregulation}} of the Norwegian pharmaceuticals market in 2001 on costs and availability of pharmaceutical products. Data has been collected from the annual reports of a sample <b>of</b> Norwegian <b>pharmacies</b> before and after the deregulation of the market. In addition, data regarding the number <b>of</b> <b>pharmacies</b> in each region in Norway has also been collected. In order to study costs, a translog function is estimated. Regressin models for the number <b>of</b> <b>pharmacies</b> in each region in Norway are also estimated. The results show that the costs <b>of</b> the individual <b>pharmacies</b> have not decreased as a consequence of the deregulation of the Norwegian pharmaceuticals market. The deregulation of the market did, however, increase the availability to pharmacy services substantially. The number <b>of</b> <b>pharmacies</b> increased from 392 in year 2000 to 524 in June 2004.

40|$|Geographical {{accessibility}} is {{an important}} determinant for the utilisation <b>of</b> community <b>pharmacies.</b> The present study explored patterns of spatial accessibility with respect to pharmacies in Liguria, Italy, a region with particular geographical and demographic features. Municipal density <b>of</b> <b>pharmacies</b> was proxied as the number <b>of</b> <b>pharmacies</b> per capita and per km 2, and spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed to identify spatial clusters. Both non-spatial and spatial models were constructed to predict the study outcome. Spatial autocorrelation analysis showed a highly significant clustered pattern in the density <b>of</b> <b>pharmacies</b> per capita (I = 0. 082) and per km 2 (I = 0. 295). Potentially under-supplied areas were mostly located in the mountainous hinterland. Ordinary least-squares (OLS) regressions established a significant positive relationship between the density <b>of</b> <b>pharmacies</b> and income among municipalities located at high altitudes, while no such association was observed in lower-lying areas. However, residuals of the OLS models were spatially auto-correlated. The best-fitting mixed geographically weighted regression (GWR) models outperformed the corresponding OLS models. Pharmacies per capita were best predicted by two local predictors (altitude and proportion of immigrants) and two global ones (proportion of elderly residents and income), while the local terms population, mean altitude and rural status and the global term income functioned as independent variables predicting pharmacies per km 2. The density <b>of</b> <b>pharmacies</b> in Liguria {{was found to be}} associated with both socio-economic and landscape factors. Mapping of mixed GWR results would be helpful to policy-makers...|$|R

40|$|Despite their {{increasingly}} {{important role in}} health care delivery, {{little is known about}} the availability, and characteristics, <b>of</b> community <b>pharmacies</b> in the United States. (1) To examine trends in the availability <b>of</b> community <b>pharmacies</b> and pharmacy characteristics (24 -hour, drive-up, home delivery, e-prescribing, and multilingual staffing) associated with access to prescription medications in the U. S. between 2007 and 2015; and (2) to determine whether and how these patterns varied by pharmacy type (retail chains, independents, mass retailers, food stores, government and clinic-based) and across counties. Retrospective analysis using annual data from the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs. Pharmacy locations were mapped and linked to the several publically-available data to derive information on county-level population demographics, including annual estimates of total population, percent of population that is non-English speaking, percent with an ambulatory disability and percent aged ≥ 65 years. The key outcomes were availability <b>of</b> <b>pharmacies</b> (total number and per-capita) and pharmacy characteristics overall, by pharmacy type, and across counties. The number <b>of</b> community <b>pharmacies</b> increased by 6. 3 % from 63, 752 (2007) to 67, 753 (2015). Retail chain and independent pharmacies persistently accounted for 40 % and 35 % <b>of</b> all <b>pharmacies,</b> respectively, while the remainder were comprised of mass retailer (12 %), food store, (10 %), clinic-based (3 %) or government (< 1 %) pharmacies. With the exception of e-prescribing, there was no substantial change in pharmacy characteristics over time. While the number <b>of</b> <b>pharmacies</b> per 10, 000 people (2. 11) did not change between 2007 and 2015 at the national-level, it varied substantially across counties ranging from 0 to 13. 6 per-capita in 2015. We also found that the majority <b>of</b> <b>pharmacies</b> do not offer accommodations that facilitate access to prescription medications, including home-delivery, with considerable variation by pharmacy type and across counties. For example, the provision of home-delivery services ranged from less than < 1 % of mass retailers to 67 % of independent stores and was not associated with county demographics, including ambulatory disability population and percent of the population aged ≥ 65 years. Despite modest growth <b>of</b> <b>pharmacies</b> in the U. S., the availability <b>of</b> <b>pharmacies,</b> and pharmacy characteristics associated with access to prescription medications, vary substantially across local areas. Policy efforts aimed at improving access to prescription medications should ensure the availability <b>of</b> <b>pharmacies</b> and their accommodations align with local population needs...|$|R

The company flourished despite the tumultuous economic conditions in the 1890s. In 1894, Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules.

40|$|Background & Objective: Due to {{the burden}} on {{citizens}} seeking access to the pharmacies, the optimal location <b>of</b> <b>pharmacies,</b> patients' access to medicines, and the pharmacies proportional distribution, are some significantly important factors to consider [...] The main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the current distribution <b>of</b> <b>pharmacies</b> and to determine the best location for the establishment <b>of</b> new <b>pharmacies</b> in the study area. Materials & Methods: This study was a case study that was conducted in the city of Shiraz. This study collected data in the form of a map to locate the service centers, weighting the criteria and compare them with other test methods which were used to analyze the hierarchy in the geographical information system (GIS). The layers (maps) used  in this study were eight dual-layer maps, including 200 meters <b>of</b> daily <b>pharmacies</b> and 1000 meters <b>of</b> overnight <b>pharmacies.</b> In addition, the final weight was calculated for each layer by AHP-Fuzzy method. Results: 24 locations in the city were demonstrated, as the best places to establish a new pharmacy according to the research criteria layers. The incompatibility rate of 0. 8 was calculated, which shows the weight of the layers located within the accepted range. The government hospitals and pharmacies layers are in the highest weight (23 %) and the lowest weight (3 %) respectively.
