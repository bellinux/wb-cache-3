25|$|A sorites {{is a form}} of {{argument}} in which a series of incomplete syllogisms is so arranged that the predicate of each premise forms the subject of the next until the subject of the first is joined with the predicate of the last in the conclusion. For example, <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>argue</b> that all lions are big cats, all big cats are predators, and all predators are carnivores. To conclude that therefore all lions are carnivores is to construct a sorites argument.|$|E
25|$|On further reflection, the Meditator {{realizes that}} even simple {{things can be}} doubted. Omnipotent God could make even our {{conception}} of mathematics false. <b>One</b> <b>might</b> <b>argue</b> that God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we should think that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, and yet this is clearly not true. If we suppose there is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived, since our imperfect senses {{would not have been}} created by a perfect being.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} {{to believe that}} the development of theory of mind is closely intertwined with language development in humans. One meta-analysis showed a moderate to strong correlation (r = 0.43) between performance on theory of mind and language tasks. <b>One</b> <b>might</b> <b>argue</b> that this relationship is due solely to the fact that both language and theory of mind seem to begin to develop substantially around the same time in children (between ages 2–5). However, many other abilities develop during this same time period as well, and do not produce such high correlations with one another nor with theory of mind. There must be something else going on to explain the relationship between theory of mind and language.|$|E

25|$|This view is {{not shared}} by Andrew Baruch Wachtel (Making a Nation, Breaking a Nation) who sees him as a {{partisan}} of South Slav unity, albeit in a limited sense, in that his linguistic definition emphasized what united South Slavs rather than the religious differences that had earlier divided them. However, <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>argue</b> that such a definition is very partisan: Karadžić himself eloquently and explicitly professed that his aim was to unite all native Shtokavian speakers whom he identified as Serbs. Therefore, Vuk Karadžić's central linguistic-political aim was {{the growth of the}} realm of Serbdom according to his ethnic-linguistic ideas and not a unity of any sort between Serbs and the other nations.|$|E

2500|$|For example, <b>one</b> person <b>might</b> <b>argue</b> erections {{are not a}} problem, {{and forcing}} males to cover up goes against their beliefs {{of the human body}} not being shameful.

25|$|It {{should be}} noted that it's not clear that the first {{objection}} really provides a challenge to Girard's theory, as even in repressive societies men are still desired (albeit by women).

2500|$|Michael W. McConnell {{has written}} that the U.S Supreme Court's {{decision}} on December 12 [...] "may have reached the right result for the wrong reason." [...] McConnell points to the Florida Supreme Court's December 11 opinion, which characterized December 12 as an [...] "outside deadline". Here is the pertinent excerpt from the December 11 opinion of the Florida Supreme Court:However, according to Nelson Lund, <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>argue</b> that the Florida Supreme Court was discussing the [...] "protest provisions of the Florida Election Code, whereas the issues in Bush v. Gore arose under the contest provisions." [...] Likewise, Peter Berkowitz {{has written that}}, [...] "Perhaps {{it would have been}} more generous for the Court to have asked the Florida court on remand whether 'outside deadline' referred to contest-period as well as protest-period recounts." [...] Abner Greene has pointed to evidence that [...] "the Florida Supreme Court thought all manual recounts – whether protest or contest – must be completed no later than December 12." [...] Nevertheless, Greene concluded that, [...] "lack of clarity about the Florida Supreme Court’s views on the safe-harbor provision should have resulted in a remand to that court for clarification," [...] in addition to the remand of December 4. The Court in Bush v. Gore did remand the case instead of dismissing it, but the remand did not include another request for clarification. Louise Weinberg argues that, even giving the Court {{the benefit of the doubt}} that it acted appropriately in intervening in Florida state law, its actions should be deemed unconstitutional because its intervention was not coupled with any kind of remedy aimed at determining the actual outcome of the election.|$|E

40|$|The {{finding that}} subjects, when told to recall {{a list of}} items “in any order, ” recall categorically or associatively related items in {{neighboring}} output positions has pro-vided a foundation {{for much of the}} organizational theo-rizing on human memory. <b>One</b> <b>might</b> even <b>argue</b> that it was these findings which caused a shift from the study of paired associate learning and serial recall in the 1950 s and early 1960 s to the study of free recall in the mid to late 1960 s.

Theoretically, this might lead to overestimating the code’s relevance for decisions, as participants were, in a way, primed and reminded to consider ethics in general and the rules in the code in particular. However, it is not the case that all codes work; so the objection that we only observe a priming effect is not conclusive.

It would no longer be acceptable to treat negative societal and environmental effects as externalities that are passed on through market transactions and ecological chain reactions, so that unknown people living somewhere else—usually the most marginalized and vulnerable—must ultimately bear the brunt of the inevitable fallout of our attempts {{to improve the quality of}} our lives.

Part of these differences in health can be attributed to biological factors, but social factors seem to play an even more important role. The health gap between men and women might evolve over time and differ between situations. This is illustrated by the decreasing difference in life expectancy between men and women, and by the relatively adverse cardiovascular risk profile of women in immigrant groups compared with the host populations.
