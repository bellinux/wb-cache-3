5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1970s, the United Kingdom was in a state of social unrest and {{widespread}} poverty as a result of the ineffective social politics of both Conservative and Labour Party governments during a three-year period of economic recession. As a consequence of deindustrialization, the unemployment rate was exceptionally high, especially among working class youth. It continued to rise in the early 1980s, peaking in February 1983. The discontent <b>of</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> caused social unrest with frequent strikes, and culminated in a series of riots (see 1981 Brixton riot, 1981 Toxteth riots). During this period, the mass of young people, deprived of the prospect of even relatively low-skill jobs that were available to the previous generations, searched for different ways to earn money in the music and entertainment businesses. The explosion of new bands and new musical styles coming from the UK in the late 1970s was a result of their efforts to make a living in the economic depression that hit the country before the governments of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.|$|E
25|$|Walter Rodney {{argued that}} the export <b>of</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> had been a {{demographic}} disaster which left Africa permanently disadvantaged {{when compared to other}} parts of the world, and it largely explains the continent's continued poverty. He presented numbers showing that Africa's population stagnated during this period, while those of Europe and Asia grew dramatically. According to Rodney, all other areas of the economy were disrupted by the slave trade as the top merchants abandoned traditional industries in order to pursue slaving, and the lower levels of the population were disrupted by the slaving itself.|$|E
25|$|Benjamin Randell Harris was a British infantryman {{who served}} in the British army during the Napoleonic Wars. He is most widely remembered today as the author of a memoir of his time in the army {{entitled}} The Recollections of Rifleman Harris, which has been seen as giving a rare insight into the world of the enlisted man in Wellington's army. Most memoirs published after the war came from serving officers, and the experiences of ordinary soldiers were overlooked due to the illiteracy <b>of</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> at that time.|$|E

In 2006, Zahn called Thrawn and Mara Jade his favorite of the characters he created.

Cormac Ó Gráda and Joel Mokyr have described the 1851 census as a famous but flawed source. They contend {{that the combination of}} institutional and individuals figures gives [...] "an incomplete and biased count" [...] of fatalities during the famine. The famine left in its wake up to a million dead and another million emigrated. The famine caused a sense of lasting bitterness by the Irish towards the British government, whom many blamed — then and now — for the starvation <b>of</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people.</b> The fall-out of the famine continued for decades afterwards.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{historian}} Klaus Hildebrand, {{moral responsibility}} for the Holocaust resides with Hitler and was {{nothing less than the}} culmination of his pathological hatred of the Jews, which {{for all intents and purposes}} formed the basis of Nazi genocide and drove the regime to pursue its racial-eliminationist goals. Whether or not Hitler never gave a direct order for the implementation of the Final Solution is immaterial and nothing more than a [...] "red herring", which fails to recognize Hitler's leadership style, particularly since his verbal commands were sufficient to launch initiatives—due largely to the fact that his subordinates were always [...] "working towards the Führer" [...] in an effort to implement [...] "his totalitarian vision" [...] even in cases [...] "without written authority." [...] Throughout Gerald Fleming's notable work, Hitler and the Final Solution, he demonstrates that on numerous occasions, Himmler mentioned a [...] "Führer-Order" [...] concerning the annihilation of the Jews, which indicates that at the very least, Hitler verbally issued a command on the subject. Journal entries from Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels support the position that Hitler was the driving force behind the destruction of the Jews as well; Goebbels wrote that Hitler followed the subject closely and described the Führer as [...] "uncompromising" [...] about eliminating the Jews. As historian David Welch asserts, if one takes the scale of the logistical operations that the Holocaust comprised (in the middle of a world-wide war) into consideration alone, it is nearly impossible that the extermination <b>of</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> and the coordination of such an extensive effort could have occurred without Hitler’s authorization.|$|E
