30|$|We {{present the}} first study <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> burden after kidney {{transplant}}ation. Themes <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> burden in kidney transplant patients {{are very similar to}} themes <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> burden in patients with multiple chronic conditions, with the exception of additional burden from conflict with donors and fear of allograft failure. Our framework is currently being used to adapt a multidimensional, patient-reported measure <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> burden for use after kidney transplantation [9]. A transplant-specific measure <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> burden may promote identification of patients at high-risk for nonadherence and graft loss, allow for modification <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> regimens and ultimately result in alleviation <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> burden and improved patient-centered care. In addition, patient-reported measures like treatment burden could be used as exploratory endpoints in future clinical trials.|$|R

Results: There were gender {{similarities and differences}} in predictors <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> entry and the combination <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> entry and completion.

5|$|Copper {{reduction}} or deficiency {{can also}} be deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes by the compound ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, in which the bright red anion tetrathiomolybdate is the copper-chelating agent. Tetrathiomolybdate was first used therapeutically {{in the treatment of}} copper toxicosis in animals. It was then introduced as a treatment in Wilson's disease, a hereditary copper metabolism disorder in humans; it acts both by competing with copper absorption in the bowel and by increasing excretion. It has also been found to have an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis, potentially by inhibiting the membrane translocation process that is dependent on copper ions. This is a promising avenue for investigation <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> for cancer, age-related macular degeneration, and other diseases that involve a pathologic proliferation of blood vessels.|$|E

When trials throw up results that companies don't like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, and even then they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion.|$|E

Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes such as increased aggression. Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. Animals are used to test the effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments,</b> such as chelating agents, and to provide information on the pathophysiology of lead, such as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.|$|E

5|$|Over 50% of MS {{patients}} may use complementary and alternative medicine, although numbers vary greatly {{depending on the}} definition of alternative medicine used.

Examples <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin B12, and antioxidants. The rationale behind the use of Vitamin D supplementation is that studies show an association between vitamin D deficiency and increasing progression of MS, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D.|$|E

5|$|There {{is also a}} {{considerable}} variety <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> for alleged attachment disorders diagnosed on the controversial alternative basis outlined above, popularly known as attachment therapy. These therapies {{have little or no}} evidence base and vary from talking or play therapies to more extreme forms of physical and coercive techniques, of which the best known are holding therapy, rebirthing, rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. In general these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. Critics maintain these therapies are not based on an accepted version of attachment theory. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis, accompanied by parenting methods which emphasise obedience and parental control. These therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. An estimated six children have died {{as a consequence of the}} more coercive forms of such treatments and the application of the accompanying parenting techniques.|$|E
