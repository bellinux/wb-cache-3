40|$|Although past {{research}} suggests that life stage is an important consideration in the work-life interface, a life stage approach in the work-life literature is uncommon and mostly focused {{on the negative side}} (work-life conflict) of the interface. Accordingly, this dissertation presents a quantitative study (N= 507) that integrates conflict and enrichment into work-life balance by life stage. Drawing on work-life theories (e. g., role scarcity) and life course research, it extends extant knowledge by confirming that work-life balance differs by life stage but not as expected. Employees in the early life stage (rather than those in later stages) had the most beneficial work-life balance. Understanding work-life balance differences by life stage may also help organisations to craft more targeted policies and practices for their employees. This dissertation examines further work-life issues by focusing on the effects <b>of</b> <b>homeworking.</b> It includes a qualitative study (N= 40), supported by quantitative data (N= 514), that explores the situation when homeworking is perceived differently by the employee and the employer. Based on Employee-Organisation Relationship (EOR) concepts (such as Perceived Organisational Support) and an extension of an inducements-contributions model, this dissertation contributes to the EOR literature by integrating employee and employer's perspectives and suggesting that differences in perceptions may produce adverse outcomes, such as employees not meeting their employer's expected contribution. This thesis also explores the role <b>of</b> <b>homeworking</b> in the organisational culture-climate alignment using a multi-model framework of organisational culture-climate. It provides a detailed contextual explanation of the potential adverse impact <b>of</b> <b>homeworking</b> on the organisation with a mixed methods approach. Findings reveal that homeworking may cause tension in the cultureclimate relationship and negatively affect organisational performance. These results contribute to the organisational culture and climate literature and the on-going debate over the consequences <b>of</b> <b>homeworking,</b> and provide a practical illustration of homeworking’s potential drawbacks...|$|R
40|$|In this {{theoretical}} {{article we}} propose {{an approach to}} the spatial implications <b>of</b> <b>homeworking</b> derived {{from the work of}} social theorist Henri Lefebvre. By highlighting the processes involved in the inherently contested and (re) constructed nature of space in the demarcated home/work environment we draw on Lefebvre to suggest a collapse of this demarcation. We consider the impact of such a collapse on questions relating to the rewards and challenges of home-based work for both workers and their co-residents. In contrast to our approach to the spatial implications of home-based work derived from Lefebvre, we argue that a traditional, Euclidean conception of space risks ignoring the important, symbolic nature of social space to the detriment of both the effective research and practice <b>of</b> <b>homeworking.</b> © SAGE Publications 2011...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings and}} analysis {{based upon the}} third wave of a national longitudinal survey in the UK which is examining part-day homeworking and comparing it with whole day homeworking. Survey results confirm earlier findings {{that there is a}} higher incidence, amongst full-time paid employees, <b>of</b> part-day <b>homeworking</b> than whole-day homeworking. The paper then separately examines determinants of the desire to part-day homework and whole day <b>homework</b> and determinants <b>of</b> the reported frequency <b>of</b> part-day <b>homeworking</b> and whole day homeworking. The determinants considered are socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents and belief statements relating to homeworking. Four statements are found to be relevant to desire to part-day and to whole-day homework: avoiding interruptions at work; avoiding wasted time in traffic; other household members appreciating the employee homeworking; and working longer hours. A similar comparison concerning actual frequency <b>of</b> <b>homeworking</b> finds that employer support is relevant for both homeworking practices, with part-day homeworking being associated with avoiding interruptions at work and whole day homeworking frequency also being associated with commute struggle. For both forms of working practice, the belief statements are better able to explain desire to homework (more) than to explain frequency <b>of</b> <b>homeworking.</b> This is perhaps not surprising given the variability of work patterns {{at the level of the}} individual that can occur from week-to-week. The better performance of desire models for whole day homeworking compared to those for part-day homeworking suggest that other factors are at play that remain to be identified in future examination <b>of</b> part-day <b>homeworking...</b>|$|R

25|$|China's {{educational}} television system began in 1960 but was suspended during the Cultural Revolution in 1966. In 1979 the Central Radio and Television University {{was established in}} Beijing with branches in twenty-eight provincial-level universities. Many Central Radio and Television University students were recent senior-middle school graduates who scored just below the cut-off point for admission to conventional colleges and universities. Full-time (who take four courses) and part-time students (two courses) had at least two years' work experience, and they return to their jobs after graduation. Spare-time students (one course) studied after work. Students whose work units granted them permission to study in a television university were paid their normal wages; expenses {{for most of their}} books and other educational materials were paid for by the state. A typical Central Radio and Television University student spent up to six hours a day over a three-year period watching lectures on videotapes produced by some of the best teachers in China. These lectures were augmented by face-to-face tutoring by local instructors and approximately four hours <b>of</b> <b>homework</b> each evening. The major problem with the system is that there were too few television sets. In 1987 the Central Television and Radio University had its programs produced, transmitted and financed by the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television. The State Education Commission developed its curriculum and distributed its printed support materials. Curriculum included both basic, general-purpose courses in science and technology and more specialized courses. The Central Television and Radio University offered more than 1,000 classes in Beijing and its suburbs and 14 majors in 2- to 3-year courses through 56 working centers. Students who passed final examinations were given certificates entitling them to the same level of remuneration as graduates of regular, full-time colleges and universities. The state gave certain allowances to students awaiting jobs during their training period.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine the educational environment that promotes the self-regulated learning of children. To realize the purpose, it was tried to devise homework that improve the metacognition, and to relate it to the class.

It was shown that the effects <b>of</b> the <b>homework</b> <b>of</b> preparation didn’t influence the self-regulated learning of the child, and only prior metacognition brought the significant effect. Because the individual differences of how to work the home study should be large, each child’s homework score was calculated based on each child’approach on homework, then the effect of the score was examined. The child with a high homework score had a high achievement score and thinking score.

40|$|Changes in {{the nature}} of work e. g. Location Independent Working and the growth <b>of</b> <b>homeworking,</b> mean that {{managers}} and their staff may not work in close proximity and so rarely meet in person. The consequent loss of visibility and physical presence creates specific challenges and constraints in relation to the managers' role in the employment relationship. As previous research has compartmentalised the perspectives of homeworkers and their managers, analysis has always been restrictive, lacking in an all-encompassing view of the employment relationship. Seeking to address this disparity, this research assesses the views of both sides of the employment relationship, thereby exploring the experiences of managers and homeworkers. Using contrasting organisations, this research explores how the practice of management control differs in a homeworking environment. The case study organisations suggest that job role, skill level and organisational size can influence a line manager’s ability to exercise control. Direct control is possible for organisations employing low skilled workers undertaking repetitive tasks. Close electronic monitoring of performance stimulates a cyclical process of resistance and increased management surveillance. For an organisation employing highly skilled autonomous workers, direct control is problematic. Managers become increasingly reliant on external proxies of performance. The objectivity of these external measures is questionable, which consequently reduces the manager’s ability to control performance. As a limited amount of research has investigated the practicalities of managing homeworkers, this research is unique as it has explored the influence <b>of</b> <b>homeworking</b> on a manager’s ability to exercise control. Consequently, these findings will offer new insights into the practice of management control in a homeworking environment. As these findings have uncovered some of the specific challenges <b>of</b> <b>homeworking</b> from a managers and homeworkers perspective, the practicalities of managing homeworkers and the potential advantages and drawbacks of working at home may now be more readily understood.
