5|$|Some {{women were}} able {{to arrive at the}} {{recruiting}} station in a man's suit, deny ever having been in love with another woman, and be easily inducted. Sexual activity, however, was forbidden, and blue discharge was almost certain if one identified <b>oneself</b> <b>as</b> a lesbian. As women found each other, they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use code words. Historian Allan Bérubé documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual or lesbian, and also never spoke about others' orientation.|$|E
50|$|Martin Luther views sinful {{human nature}} such that no person {{naturally}} desires to see others with <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>oneself,</b> each acquiring <b>as</b> {{much as he}} can while pretending to be pious.

The Oxford English Dictionary connects this with the meaning [...] "a short literary sketch or portrait", {{which is based on}} the literal meaning of [...] "cameo", a miniature carving on a gemstone. More recently, [...] "cameo" [...] has come to refer to any short appearances, whether as a character or <b>as</b> <b>oneself,</b> such <b>as</b> the examples below.|$|R
5|$|Leon Czolgosz {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, in 1873, the son of Polish immigrants. The Czolgosz family moved several times as Paul Czolgosz, Leon's father, sought work {{throughout}} the Midwest. As an adult, Leon Czolgosz worked in a Cleveland factory until {{he lost his job}} in a labor dispute in 1893. Thereafter, he worked irregularly and attended political and religious meetings, trying to understand the reasons for the economic turmoil of the Panic of 1893. In so doing, he became interested in anarchism. By 1901, this movement was feared in the United States—New York's highest court had ruled that the act of identifying <b>oneself</b> <b>as</b> an anarchist {{in front of an audience}} was a breach of the peace. Anarchists had taken a toll in Europe by assassinating or attempting assassinations of a half-dozen officials and members of royal houses, and had been blamed for the 1886 Haymarket bombing in Chicago.|$|E

25|$|Sentience (the {{ability to}} feel, perceive, or to {{experience}} subjectivity) {{is not the}} same as self-awareness (being aware of <b>oneself</b> <b>as</b> an individual). The mirror test is sometimes considered to be an operational test for self-awareness, and the handful of animals that have passed the mirror test are often considered to be self-aware. It remains debatable whether recognition of one's mirror image can be properly construed to imply full self-awareness, particularly given that robots are being constructed which appear to pass the test.|$|E
25|$|In Passion: An Essay on Personality, Unger {{explores the}} {{individual}} and his relation to society {{from the perspective of}} the root human predicament of the need to establish <b>oneself</b> <b>as</b> a unique individual in the world but at the same time to find commonality and solidarity with others. This exploration is grounded in what Unger calls a modernist image of the human being as one who lives in context but is not bound by context. Unger's aim is to level a critique, expansion, and defense of modern thinking about the human and society.|$|E

25|$|With {{regard to}} morality, Kant {{argued that the}} source of the good lies not in {{anything}} outside the human subject, either in nature or given by God, but rather is only the good will itself. A good will is one that acts from duty in accordance with the universal moral law that the autonomous human being freely gives itself. This law obliges one to treat humanityunderstood as rational agency, and represented through <b>oneself</b> <b>as</b> well as othersas an end in itself rather than (merely) as means to other ends the individual might hold. This necessitates practical self-reflection in which we universalize our reasons.|$|E
25|$|Passion: An Essay on Personality is a {{philosophical}} inquiry into human nature by philosopher and politician Roberto Mangabeira Unger. The book explores {{the individual and}} his relation to society, asking how one comes {{to an understanding of}} self and others. Unger here sees the root human predicament as the need to establish <b>oneself</b> <b>as</b> a unique individual in the world {{but at the same time}} to find commonality and solidarity with others. This exploration is grounded in what Unger calls a modernist image of the human being as one who lives in context but is not bound by context.|$|E
25|$|Disenchanted with French {{academic}} life, Ricœur taught {{briefly at}} the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium, before taking a position at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago, where he taught from 1970 to 1985. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971. His study culminated in The Rule of Metaphor: Multi-Disciplinary Studies of the Creation of Meaning in Language published in 1975 and the three-volume Time and Narrative published in 1983, 1984, 1985 Ricœur gave the Gifford Lectures in 1985/86, published in 1990 as <b>Oneself</b> <b>as</b> Another. This work built on his discussion of narrative identity and his continuing interest in the self.|$|E

5000|$|Outside sports, [...] "running interference" [...] is {{a metaphor}} that refers to a person's helping someone in the {{performance}} of a task without directly assisting in the task.

25|$|The {{concept of}} agency implies an active organism, one who desires, makes plans, and carries out actions. The sense of agency plays {{a pivotal role}} in {{cognitive}} development, including the first stage of self-awareness (or pre-theoretical experience of one's own mentality), which scaffolds theory of mind capacities. Indeed, the ability to recognize <b>oneself</b> <b>as</b> the agent of a behavior is the way the self builds as an entity independent from the external world. The sense of agency and its scientific study has important implications in social cognition, moral reasoning, and psychopathology. The conceptual distinction between SA and SO was defined by philosopher and phenomenologist Shaun Gallagher. Using a different terminology, essentially the same distinction has been made by John Campbell, and Lynn Stephens and George Graham.|$|E
25|$|Dialogue journal {{writing has}} become an {{important}} component of professional development for teachers in both pre-service teacher training programs at universities and in in-service workshops and coaching. It might take place between the professor and a class of prospective teachers in a teacher preparation program; between prospective or new teachers and experienced teachers they are working with, as a mentoring and coaching opportunity; or between prospective and practicing teachers. Those who use and study these approaches have found that these professional conversations promote reflection on <b>oneself</b> <b>as</b> a teacher and between teachers as they reflect on their practice. Some research focuses on the types of responses and interactions that are effective for promoting teacher learning. With use of the Internet, these interactions can take place among educators around the world.|$|E
25|$|The 2001 UK Census figures did {{not allow}} an {{accurate}} breakdown of traditions within the Pagan heading, as a campaign by the Pagan Federation before the census encouraged Wiccans, Heathens, Druids and others all {{to use the same}} write-in term 'Pagan' in order to maximise the numbers reported. The 2011 census however made it possible to describe <b>oneself</b> <b>as</b> Pagan-Wiccan, Pagan-Druid and so on. The figures for England and Wales showed 80,153 describing themselves as Pagan (or some subgroup thereof.) The largest subgroup was Wicca, with 11,766 adherents. The overall numbers of people self-reporting as Pagan rose between 2001 and 2011. In 2001 about seven people per 10,000 UK respondents were pagan; in 2011 the number (based on the England and Wales population) was 14.3 people per 10,000 respondents.|$|E
