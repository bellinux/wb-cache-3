A dozen leading thinkers provide their definition of love and then a thirteenth, a Magian judge, speaks at greater length on that theme.|$|E
25|$|This final {{critique}} of writing {{with which the}} dialogue concludes seems to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> facets of the conversation for {{those who seek to}} interpret Plato in general; Plato, of course, comes down to us through his numerous written works, and philosophy today is concerned almost purely with the reading and writing of written texts. It seems proper to recall that Plato's ever-present protagonist and ideal man, Socrates, fits Plato's description of the dialectician perfectly, and never wrote a thing.|$|E

Another bird skeleton was found along with carefully arranged sticks parallel to one another. Two more sets of avian related materials were found: a large amount of bird guano and a scattering of bird down.|$|E

25|$|In the end, {{options for}} the {{financing}} of the purchase came down to two companies, Westpac and Allco Leasing. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> notes to the Allco proposal {{was the nature of}} the financing arrangements it was proposing. At the time of the proposed financing deal, interest rates in Australia were around 16-17%, placing a significant burden on companies in their business dealings. To work around this, Allco proposed a financing structure that involved a cross-border financing arrangement in Japan. It also required the establishment of a special purposes lessor company, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, to minimise withholding tax liabilities from the Japanese and Australian taxation agencies. Allco refused to release specific information on the proposed structure, due to its policy prohibiting the release of specific details of this financing arrangement until it had secured a mandate for their services.|$|E

While the film earned mixed reviews, Kaif was generally praised for her portrayal. The book Mother Maiden Mistress called Dimple <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> female {{characters of the}} year and Gaurav Malani of The Economic Times said the film was watchable because of [...] "Katrina's live-wire energy wherein she never goes overboard and keeps bustling with vivacity through the runtime".

[...] Similarly, McAlpine of BBC Music wrote that on songs like [...] "Hands All Over" [...] and [...] "Stutter", the Maroon 5 shows a band [...] "who are really at their best when they play pop music like the sleazy rockers they clearly are."

500|$|... "Who's That Chick?" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics, {{the majority of}} whom praised the collaboration between Guetta and Rihanna {{as well as its}} composition. It was described as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> songs to be released in 2010, due to how the song was connection to multiple projects, including a promotional campaign with Doritos and both artist's albums. The song achieved moderate chart success; it peaked at number one on the Wallonia singles chart in Belgium, Slovakia, the UK Dance Chart and the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart. It attained top five positions on the singles charts in Austria, Finland, France, Ireland, Norway, Spain and Switzerland. It was less successful on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it peaked at number 51. Two accompanying music videos were directed by Jonas Åkerlund. A bright and colourful daytime version was shot and used to promote the Doritos campaign, whilst a more dark and sinister nighttime version was shot as the song's official music video.|$|E
500|$|Both Al Gore and Kemp had Presidential aspirations, which induced {{pursuit of}} debate {{on a higher}} plane. In addition, Gore and Kemp were long-time friends, unlike Gore and his {{previous}} vice presidential opponent Dan Quayle. [...] Thus, as debaters they avoided personal attacks. However, some felt Kemp failed to counter substantive attacks. In the final October 9, 1996 Vice Presidential Debate against Al Gore (held as the Dole–Kemp ticket trailed badly in the national polls), Kemp was soundly beaten, and Al Gore's performance {{is considered one of}} the best modern debate performances. The debate topics ranged broadly from the usual such as abortion and foreign policy to the unusual such as an incident preceding the then-current baseball playoffs, in which Roberto Alomar, the Baltimore Orioles' second baseman, cursed and spat on an umpire. The Mexico policy debate was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> topics for critical review. The Gore victory was not a surprise since Kemp had been outmatched by Gore in previous encounters, and Gore had a reputation as an experienced and vaunted debater.|$|E

500|$|Appreciating the game's pinball gameplay, 1UP.com {{thought that}} its Metroid motif did not add {{much more to}} the game. Nintendo World Report felt differently; they were {{impressed}} with the game's [...] "top-notch graphics and sound that believably invoke the Metroid series". They also appreciated the pinball innovations introduced in the game that incorporate features from the series, concluding, [...] "This game really does feel like a seamless, if unlikely, merging between classic arcade pinball and the creepy-cool Metroid Prime series." [...] The sentiment was shared by GameSpot's Greg Kasavin, who was convinced that pinball was an excellent medium to simulate the challenging struggles found in the Metroid series, noting that the game [...] "pulls it off very well" [...] by being faithful to the main series. Bryn Williams of GameSpy was impressed after playing the game; he noted that it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> gaming sessions that anyone can have on the Nintendo DS. Metroid Prime Pinballs gameplay was lauded by reviewers. Craig Harris of IGN appreciated Fuse Games' work on the game, praising the graphics, audio, and gameplay, along with its [...] "pick-up-and-play" [...] element that {{made it easy for}} people with varying levels of skill to play. X-Play felt the same way, noting that the simple controls and [...] "short bursts of gameplay" [...] make Metroid Prime Pinball a perfect handheld video game. In addition, they asserted that the game has great value because of the included wireless multiplayer mode, which allows up to eight players to play the game with just one game card.|$|E
500|$|Votta {{criticized the}} show for the [...] "pointless adult love triangle" [...] {{involving}} Coach Beiste, Sue, and Cooter Menkins. VanDerWerff described Jones as [...] "one of the show's greatest gifts", and lamented that they had her [...] "fighting with Sue Dynasty-style over a recruiter for Ohio State". Bell called the scene where Beiste [...] "confesses her love for Cooter" [...] a [...] "simply sweet scene that's only ruined by Sue's grumpy presence", and Sue's decision to go after Cooter a [...] "crazy plot". Votta looked at Sue's pursuit of Cooter through a different lens: [...] "in an episode that should be about kids {{who are looking for}} approval and the various ways they do and don't achieve that", the show gives a [...] "completely opposite message from Sue's quest to prove her straightness", which [...] "muddles" [...] the show's messages. Chaney thought that Sue [...] "was back in fine, vindictive catchphrase-spewing form", and noted that [...] "all the election subplots were tied up remarkably quickly". This last point did not sit well with Berk, who wrote that the show resolved [...] "what was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> subplots in one of the least interesting ways", and Canning was disappointed that the episode did not have [...] "more with Burt". As for Burt's son, Kurt, Votta wanted to [...] "leap through the television and explain to him that student council elections mean absolutely nothing" [...] to his future college prospects, and Kubicek declared himself [...] "sick" [...] of that plot thread, which he called [...] "just plain moronic".|$|E
500|$|Billed by {{her record}} label Parlophone as her {{comeback}} album, Aphrodite {{is a celebration}} of Minogue's [...] "dance-floor roots", and is primarily a dance-pop and disco album. Its title alludes to the Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation. [...] "All the Lovers", {{one of the last}} tracks to be recorded for the album, is a [...] "squiggly" [...] electropop-influenced disco song written by Jim Eliot and Mima Stilwell, who had previously collaborated with Minogue on [...] "2 Hearts", the lead single from X. It is similar to Minogue's 2004 single [...] "I Believe in You", but has a [...] "more danceable edge", and features a [...] "gauzy, heartbeat rhythm" [...] and 1980s-stylised synthesiser riffs. The song was met with critical acclaim from music critics and was frequently commended for its production and chorus. The second track [...] "Get Outta My Way" [...] combines electronic music and bubblegum pop with disco elements. The song focuses on a [...] "frustrated and furious" [...] Minogue delivering [...] "wispy" [...] vocals in a form of a warning to her uncaring partner, indicating that she may leave him and start [...] "grinding away with another chap". Its lyrical content is suggestive in nature. The song received generally favourable reviews from music critics and was complimented for its musical composition and subject matter. [...] "Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)" [...] is a hi-NRG-influenced club song. Receiving mixed critical reviews, its lyrics were criticised for being clichéd although one critic named it a [...] "concert hit waiting to happen." [...] "Closer" [...] takes a darker and more atmospheric approach, featuring [...] "sighing background vocals and spiralling harpsichord-esque synths." [...] Critics felt that it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> and experimental songs of the album.|$|E

500|$|BuddyTV staff {{columnist}} Don Williams {{felt the}} addition of Ruby was a [...] "cheap ploy" [...] to attract teen male viewers, that the character distracted viewers from the [...] "brotherly bond that made the show so special in the first place", and that Cassidy [...] "was cast more for her looks than her acting prowess". However, he later admitted Ruby [...] "remains <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> and ambiguous evildoers on the series". Although IGN's Diana Steenbergen had looked forward to Ruby's introduction, she ultimately found the third-season incarnation a [...] "wasted" [...] character who did little to improve the series. Her main concerns consisted of Ruby's [...] "unlikable and manipulative" [...] qualities and her tendency to make the Winchesters [...] "look stupid". Cassidy [...] "never quite [...] " [...] the [...] "tough chick" [...] persona of Buffy the Vampire Slayers Faith or Battlestar Galacticas Six. TV Guides Tina Charles, however, liked Ruby's action-packed introduction in [...] "The Magnificent Seven". She was [...] "intrigued" [...] by the character in [...] "The Kids Are Alright", and felt Cassidy was [...] "doing a good job". Ruby made a [...] "plausible addition" [...] to [...] "Malleus Maleficarum", with Charles finding it [...] "cool" [...] to learn Ruby's backstory due to its implications for Dean's storyline. Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune thought Cassidy [...] "wasn't awful" [...] in [...] "The Magnificent Seven". Though [...] "not great enough for Ackles to really play off of" [...] in [...] "Malleus Maleficarum", the actress was [...] "good {{enough to make her}} weaker acting chops kind of work for her". While under the impression that Ruby had been killed off in [...] "No Rest for the Wicked", Peterson wrote that the character [...] "got gone just as [...] getting interesting" [...] and deemed her a [...] "decent traveling [...] ".|$|E
