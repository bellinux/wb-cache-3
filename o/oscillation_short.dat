30|$|The F-layer bottom height {{variability}} and vertical uplifting {{during the afternoon}} to the terminator passing period were monitored via two ionosondes: one located at São Luis (2.6 ° S, 44.2 ° W) and the other located at Fortaleza (3.9 ° S, 38.4 ° W). In the present study, the F-layer true height (hF) at fixed plasma frequencies (5, 6, 7, and 8  MHz) was used. The data sampling interval was 10  min, which {{makes it difficult to}} pick up temporal <b>oscillations</b> <b>shorter</b> than 30  min. In order to see short-period oscillations (0.5 – 3  h) in the temporal variation of hF, d(hF) was calculated using a band-pass filter that could eliminate longer period oscillations.

With 21 subjects sitting with three backrest heights (no backrest, short backrest, high backrest) discomfort caused by lateral, roll, and fully roll-compensated lateral oscillation was investigated at frequencies between 0. 25 and 1. 0 Hz. With lateral <b>oscillation,</b> the <b>short</b> backrest reduced discomfort at frequencies less than 0. 63 Hz and the high backrest reduced discomfort at frequencies less than 1. 0 Hz.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a {{historical}} perspective on the main experimental steps which led to the current picture of neutrino oscillations in the “atmospheric parameter region. ” In the 1980 s a deficit of atmospheric muon neutrinos was observed with the first generation of underground experiments.

However, when examined in conjunction with published data from the Norwegian Sea, new evidence from the subpolar North Atlantic suggests that coupled surface-deepwater oscillations occurred during the penultimate deglaciation.

This three-part thesis presents research directed towards understanding these anomalies and searching for sterile neutrino oscillations. Part I contains a theoretical discussion of neutrino coherence properties. The open-quantum-system picture of neutrino beams, which allows a rigorous prediction of coherence distances for accelerator neutrinos, is presented. Validity of the standard treatment of active and sterile neutrino <b>oscillations</b> at <b>short</b> baselines is verified and non-standard coherence loss effects at longer baselines are predicted. Part II concerns liquid argon detector development for the MicroBooNE experiment, which will search for short-baseline oscillations in the Booster Neutrino Beam at Fermilab. Topics include characterization and installation of the MicroBooNE optical system; test-stand measurements of liquid argon optical properties with dissolved impurities; optimization of wavelength-shifting coatings for liquid argon scintillation light detection; testing and deployment of high-voltage surge arrestors to protect TPC field cages; and software development for optical and TPC simulation and reconstruction. Part III presents a search for sterile neutrinos using the IceCube neutrino telescope, which has collected a large sample of atmospheric-neutrino-induced events in the 1 - 10 TeV energy range. Sterile neutrinos would modify the detected neutrino flux shape via MSW-resonant oscillations. Following a careful treatment of systematic uncertainties in the sample, no evidence for MSW-resonant oscillations is observed, and exclusion limits on 3 + 1 model parameter space are derived.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of cytosolic Ca 2 concentration exhibits oscillations {{with a wide}} range of periods. It was suggested in recent years by several modelling studies that these oscillations do not result from an oscillatory local dynamics but that fluctuations drive the formation of spatial and temporal structures in a non oscillatory dynamic regime. Fluctuations arise from the random opening and closing of release channels on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Consequently, the interspike interval ISI has not a sharp value as with regular oscillations but distributions of ISI arise. We present these distributions and relate them to underlying processes. Oscillations with long average ISI can be comprehended as repetitive wave triggering.
