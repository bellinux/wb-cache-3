5|$|Marvin Bower is {{credited}} with creating McKinsey's values and principles in 1937. He established a set of rules: that consultants should put the interests <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> before McKinsey's revenues, not discuss client affairs, tell the truth {{even if it means}} challenging the client's opinion, and only perform work that is both necessary and that McKinsey can do well. Bower created the firm's principle of only working with CEOs, which was later expanded to CEOs of subsidiaries and divisions. He also created McKinsey's principle of only working with clients the firm felt would follow its advice.|$|E
5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in Europe, {{the collapse of}} papal authority in the Papal Schism allowed the Scottish Crown to gain effective control of major ecclesiastical appointments within the kingdom. This de facto authority over appointments was formally recognised by the Papacy in 1487. This led to the placement <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> and relatives of the king in key positions, including James IV's illegitimate son Alexander, who was nominated as Archbishop of St. Andrews {{at the age of}} 11, intensifying royal influence and also opening the Church to accusations of venality and nepotism. James IV used his pilgrimages to Tain and Whithorn to help bring the respective regions of Ross and Galloway, which lay on the edges of the kingdom, under royal authority. Relationships between the Scottish Crown and the Papacy were generally good, with James IV receiving tokens of papal favour. In 1472 St Andrews became the first archbishopric in the Scottish church, to be followed by Glasgow in 1492.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{were often}} first sketched by Oliver, before {{she moved to}} {{construction}} in three dimensions. When preparing commissions, she would draw on the ideas <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> or {{the nature of the}} site. For large works she created maquettes (or models), sometimes in plasticine, on other occasions using copper wire or, in the case of her 2002 sculpture Globe, wood and metal. Oliver would produce the more delicate works herself. Many were created by crafting and joining wire to create abstract forms. These were built around moulds, twisting the metal into place with pliers, before severing it with wirecutters. Joins were soldered or brazed (though in some pieces, the wire was woven). In Web (2002), copper pieces were sewn together using wire.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{to produce}} one {{thousand}} Verdeja tanks were approved on 2 December 1940, divided into ten batches {{of one hundred}} tanks each. The Verdeja production prototype was to adopt the 120horsepower (89kW) Lincoln-Zephyr gasoline V12 engine, requiring a contract between the Spanish government and Ford Motor Ibérica, Ford's Spanish subsidiary. Simultaneously, in case of failure of talks between Ford and Spain, the government also began to contact a number of German companies, including Maybach. In order to begin production, the Tank Workshop in Zaragoza was to be expanded to allow final assembly of at least five tanks per month. Despite funding and two years of construction allotted, the factory construction and expansion was never completed. Other problems arose, including the failure {{to reach an agreement}} with Ford or Maybach. These factors, the poor economic situation in Spain, the lack <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> other than the Spanish Army and the lack of incentives for Spanish companies to partake in the construction program, led to the abandonment of the attempt to fabricate the Verdeja1. Another attempt was undertaken at contracting the ADESA (Armamento de Aviación, S.A.) company, to manufacture two Verdeja light tanks for experimental purposes. Despite the failure to procure an engine, ADESA offered to construct 300 units, but these attempts failed and the program was abandoned by 1941.|$|E
5|$|Starting in Western Han was {{a system}} of {{recommendation}} where local officials submitted proposals to the capital on which of their subordinates were worthy candidates for holding office; this created a patron-client relationship between former superiors and successful nominees to higher office. With the enhanced prestige of the consort clan under Empress Dowager Dou (d. 97 CE), a succession of regents from her clan and others amassed a large amount <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> whose chances of promotion hinged on the political survival of the empress dowager's clan, which was often short-lived. Aside from patron-client relationships, one could use family connections to secure office. Patricia Ebrey writes that in the Western Han, access to public office and promotion through social mobility were open to a larger segment of the populace than in Eastern Han. A third of the two hundred and fifty-two Eastern Han government officials who had biographies in the Book of Later Han were sons or grandsons of officials, while a fifth came from prominent provincial families or had ancestors who had served as officials. For forty-six of the one hundred and ten years between 86 and 196 CE, at least one post of the Three Excellencies was occupied {{by a member of}} either the Yuan or Yang clan.|$|E

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{psychotherapy}} researchers are studying in-session events that signify therapeutic change, process or progress. Similarly, a number of psychotherapy theorists have suggested that <b>client</b> strength <b>of</b> feeling is related to therapeutic change, process and progress. The {{purpose of the present}} research was to: (a) examine the relationship between client change events and <b>client</b> strength <b>of</b> feeling, (b) identify what particular levels <b>of</b> <b>client</b> strength <b>of</b> feeling are related to given categories <b>of</b> <b>client</b> change events, and (c) examine the effects that type of therapy may have in the relationship between client change events and <b>client</b> strength <b>of</b> feeling. Judges assessed the occurrence <b>of</b> categories <b>of</b> <b>client</b> change events and the level <b>of</b> <b>client</b> strength <b>of</b> feeling in 982 statements in 10 sessions of client-centered, rational-emotive and experiential therapies. The findings indicated that: (a) there is an overall positive significant relationship between client change events and <b>client</b> strength <b>of</b> feeling; (b) given categories <b>of</b> <b>client</b> change events are significantly related to particular levels <b>of</b> <b>client</b> strength <b>of</b> feeling; and (c) type of therapy is a significant variable in the relationship between client change events and <b>client</b> strength <b>of</b> feeling. These findings have implications for psychotherapeutic practice and also for clinical theory, with especial relevance for the role and meaning of level of strength <b>of</b> feeling, in-session <b>client</b> change, and a practitioner relevant matrix of conducting sessions of therapy {{on the basis of the}} research variables.

40|$|Client {{influence}} on property valuation {{has been an}} emerging theme of behavioural research {{in the real estate}} discipline.

A questionnaire survey was administered to valuers to measure their perception with regard to factors affecting client influence in Malaysia. The effect <b>of</b> <b>client</b> size and size of value adjustment requested by clients on valuation were also tested in a behavioural experiment. The survey revealed that valuers in Malaysia perceived client characteristics and valuer characteristics as {{some of the most important}} factors affecting client {{influence on}} valuations. It was found that factors such as type <b>of</b> <b>client,</b> size <b>of</b> <b>client,</b> integrity <b>of</b> valuer and experience of valuer could potentially impact on the amount and type of influence exerted on valuations. The results of the logistic regression model indicated that neither the client size nor magnitude of value adjustment requested by client affected the decisions of valuers to alter valuation outcome...|$|R
