5|$|With 1,300 deputies {{still in}} Cripple Creek, Sheriff Bowers {{was unable to}} control the army he had created. On June 5, the deputies moved into Altman, perhaps {{as a prelude to}} {{storming}} Bull Hill. The deputies cut the telegraph and telephone wires leading <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> <b>and</b> imprisoned a number of reporters. Concerned that the paramilitary force might get out of hand, Waite again dispatched the state militia, this time under the command of General E.J. Brooks.|$|E
5|$|M-106 {{starts in}} {{downtown}} Jackson {{at the corner}} of Cooper Street and Michigan Avenue. Michigan Avenue runs east–west carrying Business Loop Interstate 94 (BL I-94), Business US127 (Bus. US127) and M-50, and Cooper Street runs northwesterly from here carrying M-106. The highway passes through residential neighborhoods immediately north of downtown, and turns due north near Jackson Catholic Middle School and the historic Michigan State Prison. Continuing a few miles north through an interchange with I-94 and US127, M-106 runs north out of town. Cooper Street continues <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> <b>and</b> the trunkline runs by the State Prison of Southern Michigan.|$|E
5|$|Manning's {{father took}} a job as an {{information}} technology (IT) manager for a rental car agency, which required travel. The family lived several miles <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> <b>and</b> Manning's mother was unable to drive. She spent her days drinking, while Manning was left largely to fend for herself, playing with Legos or on the computer. Brian would stock up on food before his trips, and leave pre-signed checks that Casey mailed to pay the bills. A neighbor said that whenever Manning's elementary school went on field trips, she would give her own son extra food or money so he could make sure Manning had something to eat. Friends and neighbors considered the Mannings a troubled family.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the 1960s and 1970s it {{was thought}} that gas holders could be {{replaced}} with high-pressure bullets (a cylindrical pressure vessel with hemispherical ends). However, regulations brought in meant that all new bullets must be built several miles <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>towns</b> <b>and</b> cities, and the security of storing large amounts of high-pressure natural gas above ground made them unpopular with local people and councils. Bullets are gradually being decommissioned. It is also possible to store natural gas in liquid form, and this is widely practised throughout the world.|$|R
5|$|On September 27, 1835, a {{detachment}} of 100 dragoons, led by Francisco de Castañeda, left San Antonio de Béxar, carrying an official order for Ponton to surrender the cannon. Castañeda had {{been instructed to}} avoid using force if possible. When the troops neared Gonzales on September 29, {{they found that the}} settlers had removed the ferry and all other boats from the Guadalupe River. On {{the other side of the}} swiftly moving river waited eighteen Texians. Albert Martin, captain of the Gonzales militia, informed the soldiers that Ponton was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> <b>and</b> until his return the army must remain on the west side of the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} relocations along {{what is now}} K-383 {{occurred}} in Norton. US-36 and US-83 originally entered the city along Washington Street, turned north onto First Avenue, and turned east onto Main Street. The highway followed Main Street <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> along a road paralleling the railroad to the present highway. The first realignment was authorized in 1936 to eliminate several right-angle turns and several at-grade railroad crossings. East of the intersection of First and Main, US-36 and US-83 turned north onto State Street and followed the highway to Holme Street, where the highways joined the present course. By 1941, this change was deemed unsatisfactory due to {{the continued existence of}} right-angle turns and grade crossings. Shortly thereafter, the highways were moved to their present course bypassing downtown Norton.|$|E
5|$|The highway crosses into Kalkaska County at Barker Creek and {{continues}} eastward to Kalkaska. There, M-72 meets US131/M-66 (Cedar Street) {{on the north}} side of downtown, and M-72 turns south along Cedar Street and forms another triple concurrency through downtown. South of town, the highway crosses the Boardman River again, and M-72 turns east again headed toward the city of Grayling. M-66 follows M-72 to cross a set of railroad tracks that belong to the Great Lakes Central Railroad before leaving to follow its path to Lake City. M-72 crosses the Manistee River at the Kalkaska–Crawford county line and passes the northern shore of Lake Margrethe west of town in the Camp Grayling military reservation. North of the camp gate, M-72 joins M-93 into downtown Grayling. Together they meet James Street, which carries Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75). M-93 turns north to follow BL I-75 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> <b>and</b> M-72 turns south to follow it through downtown. At South Down River Road, M-72 turns east again to leave Grayling, crossing I-75 in the process. There is no direct access to I-75 from M-72. Instead traffic is directed to follow BL I-75 in either direction to get to the freeway.|$|E

Veronica and Piz visit the police department, and they say {{there have been other}} victims. Veronica learns that the Hearst “Welcome Wagon” is actually fake.|$|E
25|$|During the Bisbee Deportation, Phelps Dodge {{executives}} {{seized control}} of the telegraph and telephones to prevent news of the arrests and expulsion from being reported. Company executives refused to let Western Union send wires <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> <b>and</b> stopped Associated Press reporters from filing stories.

25|$|The {{road that}} is now SH-110 is first shown {{as part of the}} state highway system on the 1948 {{official}} state map. The highway was originally known as State Highway 7C and was all gravel. The route roughly followed that of the present day. In 1955, SH-7C was removed from the state highway system. The new road to Dougherty was SH-110, which traveled northeast <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> ended at SH-7 just west of Sulphur In 1957, this route was paved.|$|E

25|$|In 1898 Alex Manly of Wilmington, North Carolina, {{directly}} challenged popular {{ideas about}} lynching {{in an editorial}} in his newspaper The Daily Record, {{believed to be the}} only black-owned newspaper in the nation. He noted that consensual relationships took place between white women and black men, and said that many of the latter had white fathers (as he did). His references to miscegenation lifted the veil of denial. Whites were outraged. A mob destroyed his printing press and business, ran black leaders <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> killed many others, and overturned the biracial Populist-Republican city government, headed by a white mayor and majority-white council. Manly escaped, eventually settling in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|Brown was {{accompanied}} by the sheriff and his assistants, but no minister since he had consistently rejected the ministrations of pro-slavery clergy. Since the region was in the grips of virtual hysteria, most northerners, including journalists, were run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> <b>and</b> it is unlikely any anti-slavery clergyman would have been safe, even {{if one were to}} have sought to visit Brown. He elected to receive no religious services in the jail or at the scaffold. He was hanged at 11:15 a.m. and pronounced dead at 11:50 a.m. His body was placed in a wooden coffin with the noose still around his neck. His coffin was then put on a train to take it away from Virginia to his family homestead in New York for burial. In the North, large memorial meetings took place, church bells rang, minute guns were fired, and famous writers such as Emerson and Thoreau joined many Northerners in praising Brown.|$|E
25|$|NY436 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY39 in Lamont, a hamlet within {{the town of}} Pike in Wyoming County. It initially heads eastward on Denton Corners Road, overlapping with County Route38 (CR38) as it traverses a mixture of open fields and farmland and enters the town of Genesee Falls. After , NY436 intersects NY19A at a four-way intersection. While CR38 continues eastward into Letchworth State Park, NY436 turns to the south, initially following NY19A around the southwestern tip of the park. Both routes eventually enter the park, however, as they approach the hamlet of Portageville, a community situated at the park's southern end. At this point, the mostly east–west NY436 leaves the predominantly north–south NY19A, allowing the latter to take the southern path <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> parallel the Genesee River as it travels southward. NY436, meanwhile, turns eastward to follow {{the northern edge of}} Portageville.|$|E

25|$|The state route {{begins at}} a signalized {{intersection}} in Jamestown where Washington Street and Limestone Street (SR 72) intersect. SR 734 heads east <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> begins {{to climb a}} small hill. About halfway up the hill, the route makes a left turn, old US 35 continues straight. Passing through farmlands and small clusters of residences, the route passes over a freeway carrying US 35; no interchange is present at this overpass. After crossing into Fayette County, the route heads east through flat farmlands with occasional homes and bridges over small streams. Upon entering Jeffersonville, the route name carries High Street into the downtown area of the village. At an intersection with Main Street, SR 734 turns right and forms a concurrency with State Routes 41 and 729. Main Street, carrying the three routes, heads southeast, but the road curves to due east and becomes known as State Street. SR 729 breaks away and heads south at South Street but Routes 41 and 734 continue east towards the eastern extents of town. After having a grade crossing with an Indiana and Ohio Railway railroad, the routes pass two industrial facilities and some commercial businesses as they approach I-71's exit 69. The interchange with the Interstate highway is a simple diamond-interchange allowing for full-access between the surface roads and the freeway. Shortly after the interchange, SR 734 turns left off of SR 41 which continues south towards Washington Court House ending the concurrency. For the last segment of the route, the route travels through sparsely-populated farmland and ends in rural Paint Township at SR 38.|$|E

Nevelson and Janis entered into a contentious legal battle that left Nevelson broke, depressed, and at risk of becoming homeless. However, at this time Nevelson was offered a funded, six-week artist fellowship at Tamarind Lithography Workshop (now Tamarind Institute) in Los Angeles, which allowed her to escape the drama of New York City.

Confirming Leonard's information on [...] "John G" [...] and his warnings, Leonard drives Teddy to an abandoned building, leading to the opening, where he shoots him.|$|E
500|$|In {{the village}} of Reese, M-81 crosses the Huron and Eastern Railway twice. East of town, the highway follows Caro Road through more farm fields through the {{community}} of Watrousville. Near {{the south side of}} the Tuscola Area Airport, M-81 turns to the northeast running along the Cass River to Caro. In the city, the trunkline follows State Street past the fairgrounds. At the intersection with Ellington Street, M-81 crosses M-24. The highway continues northeasterly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> through the community of Ellington. Northeast of Elmwood, M-81 turns due east along Cass City Road. The trunkline runs to {{the village of}} Cass City where it follows Main Street through residential neighborhoods and the central business district.

Approximately [...] into the county, M-81 ends at the intersection with M-53 (Van Dyke Road).|$|E
500|$|His restive nature, however, did not diminish. As a young man, Saint-Just was [...] "wild, handsome, [...] transgressive". Well-connected and popular, {{he showed}} a special affection toward {{a young woman}} of Blérancourt, Thérèse Gellé. She was the {{daughter}} of another wealthy notary, a powerful and autocratic figure in the town; he was still an undistinguished adolescent. He is said to have proposed marriage to her; she is said to have desired it. Though no hard evidence exists regarding their relationship, official records show that on 25 July 1786, Thérèse was married to Emmanuel Thorin, the scion of a prominent local family. Saint-Just was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> unaware of the event, and tradition portrays him as brokenhearted. Whatever his true state, it is known that {{a few weeks after the}} marriage he abruptly left home for Paris – without an announcement, but not without gathering up a pair of pistols and a good quantity of his mother's silver. His venture turned short when his mother had him seized by police and sent to a reformatory (maison de correction) where he stayed from September 1786 to March 1787. Chastened, Saint-Just attempted to begin anew: he enrolled as a student at the School of Law, Reims University. After a year, however, he drifted away from law school and returned to his mother's home in Blérancourt penniless, without any occupational prospects.|$|E
