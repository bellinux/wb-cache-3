40|$|The {{increasing}} racial' and ethnic' {{diversity of}} cities in a neoliberal terrain calls for planning scholars {{to revisit the}} notions <b>of</b> <b>race</b> and ethnicity in relation to capital. Theorists of Canadian multiculturalism have often used culturalist notions <b>of</b> <b>race</b> that are divorced from the inseparable links between racialization and capitalist processes. In light of this quandary, this paper is an attempt at a renewed conceptual and historical interpretation <b>of</b> <b>race</b> and capitalism by using a selection of Marxist scholars. The research takes two specific avenues in exploring race and capitalism: {{an analysis of the}} production <b>of</b> <b>race</b> in the labour history of the United States, and Caribbean slavery in the development of global capitalism. Furthermore, the paper concludes with a reflection on the implications of its content for planning. The construcxion <b>of</b> <b>race</b> is inextricably tied to the development of capitalism. The historical relationship <b>of</b> <b>race</b> to issues <b>of</b> labour, slavery, and colonial-imperial processes demonstrates the shared conceptual roots <b>of</b> <b>race,</b> class and capital...|$|R
40|$|The small GTPase racE is {{essential}} for cytokinesis in Dictyostelium but its precise role in cell division is not known. To determine the molecular mechanism <b>of</b> <b>racE</b> function, we undertook a mutational analysis <b>of</b> <b>racE.</b> The exogenous expression <b>of</b> either wild-type <b>racE</b> or a constitutively active V 20 racE mutant effectively rescues the cytokinesis deficiency <b>of</b> <b>racE</b> null cells. In contrast, a constitutively inactive N 25 racE mutant fails to rescue the cytokinesis deficiency. Thus, cytokinesis requires only the activation <b>of</b> <b>racE</b> by GTP and not the inactivation <b>of</b> <b>racE</b> by hydrolysis <b>of</b> GTP. To determine the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>racE,</b> we created a fusion protein with GFP at the amino terminus <b>of</b> <b>racE.</b> Remarkably, GFP-racE fusion protein was fully competent to rescue the phenotype <b>of</b> <b>racE</b> null cells and, therefore, must reside in the same location as native racE. We found that GFP-racE localized to the plasma membrane of the cell throughout the entire cell cycle. Furthermore, constitutively active and inactive GFP-racE fusion proteins also localized to the plasma membrane. We mapped the domain required for plasma membrane localization to the carboxyl-terminal 40 amino acids <b>of</b> <b>racE.</b> This domain, however, {{is not sufficient to}} confer racE function onto a closely related GTPase. Taken together, these results suggest that racE functions at the cell cortex but it is not involved in determining the timing or placement of the contractile ring...|$|R

Pearson was racing against Bobby Isaac and Buddy Baker {{at the end of}} the Winston 500 at Talladega Superspeedway when Jimmy Crawford spun into Isaac; Pearson won the race.

5|$|Orme was {{retired to}} stud {{at the end}} of his four-year-old season, and on 26 October 1893 he left Newmarket for Eaton Stud. His first {{covering}} was St. Mary, a daughter of Hermit, which resulted in his first foal (a chestnut colt) being born in January 1895. His stud fee for 1898 was 200 guineas, plus one guinea for the groom. Orme became a successful stallion and was champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland in 1899, with more than double the winnings of any other sire that year, largely thanks to his son Flying Fox. His son Duke of Westminster was sold for £20,050 as a two-year-old. His fee was still 200 guineas in 1902. In total Orme sired 242 winners <b>of</b> <b>races</b> worth a total of £122,568.|$|E
5|$|Porter was {{interested}} in reforming the sport of horse racing, and expended much effort in the newspaper trying to bring together horsemen in the {{various parts of the}} country. Although the effort did not bear fruit, the Spirit became a repository for information of interest to those involved in horse racing, printing statistics and results <b>of</b> <b>races.</b> Porter was also involved in attempts to publish an American stud book for race horses in the United States, similar to the General Stud Book that was published in England documenting the pedigrees of Thoroughbred horses. In February 1837, Porter announced in the Spirit the projected coverage of the project, which was to be edited by Wiley Jones Stratton, who was secretary to the National Jockey Club in Washington, D. C. But this project never materialized, and Porter turned to Patrick Nesbitt Edgar in January 1838 to take over the project. But Edgar did not finish the work, and by 1842, the project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat was by Bold Ruler, {{who led the}} North America sire list eight times, {{more than}} any other {{stallion}} in the 20th century. He also led the juvenile (two-year-old) sire list a record six times. Before Secretariat's Triple Crown run, Bold Ruler was often categorized as a sire of precocious juveniles that lacked stamina or did not train on past age two. However, even before Secretariat, Bold Ruler actually had sired 11 stakes winners <b>of</b> <b>races</b> at 10 furlongs or more. Ultimately, seven of the ten Kentucky Derby winners in the 1970s traced directly to Bold Ruler in their tail male lines, including Secretariat and fellow Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew.|$|E
