30|$|These results {{agree with}} the ones {{presented}} by Smith (2000) and Paton etÂ al. (2001, 2002), whom analyse {{the effect of the}} different taxation schemes in Australian, UK and USA betting markets. These results, however, are more focused on <b>offline</b> <b>betting</b> operators and government revenue. Moreover, they take into account the marginal cost of each bet. As opposed, we assume that these marginal costs are negligible.|$|E
30|$|A {{remarkable}} {{feature of}} online betting (which includes sports, casino and card games such as poker) {{is that their}} operators require {{little more than an}} internet web page to enter a new market. As opposed to offline operators, they do not need to open physical selling points. Under an unregulated market, the cost of offering a bet is inelastic with respect to the bet volume, i.e. the total sum of betting stakes. This is because online betting users can bet from any internet terminal, even at home. As opposed, <b>offline</b> <b>betting</b> users need to be physically at a selling point.|$|E

The reason for such action was very stringent Italian legislation prohibiting even legitimate European gambling operators to offer their online services in Italy. Only the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) and the National Horse Breeders Enhancement Society (UNIRE) were allowed to arrange sports <b>betting</b> <b>offline</b> and online. Websites run by other operators were blocked to prevent Italians from using them.|$|R
