The ZRM radially partitions the membrane stack and the hold-up volumes within the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>manifolds</b> into zones to better capture non-uniform flow distribution effects associated with the large column diameter to height ratio.

40|$|Flow boiling in microchannels, while very {{promising}} as a cooling technology in electronics thermal management, {{is still a}} subject being explored that requires further investigation. Before applying this technology for high heat flux computer chip cooling, challenging issues such as fully understanding boiling mechanisms in confined spaces, extending and stabilising the nucleate boiling regime, suppressing flow boiling instabilities, maintaining uniform flow distribution among microchannels, have to be addressed. If flow boiling {{is to be used}} as a thermal management method for high heat flux electronics it is necessary to understand the behaviour of a non-uniform heat distribution, which is typically the case observed in a real operating computer chip. In this study, flow boiling of deionised water in a silicon microchannel heat sink under uniform and non-uniform heating has been investigated with particular attention to flow boiling instabilities. An experimental system was designed and constructed to carry out the experimental investigations. The experimental heat sink consisting of forty parallel rectangular microchannels with 194 μm hydraulic diameter together with integrated inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>manifold</b> was fabricated on a silicon wafer using inductive coupled plasma dry etching, in conjunction with photolithographic techniques. A design with integrated temperature sensors made from a thin nickel film allows local temperature measurements with a much faster response time and smaller thermal resistance as compared to temperature measurements using thermocouples. The integrated heater was designed to enable either uniform or non-uniform heating (hotspot investigation) with a low thermal resistance between the heater and the channels. Numerical simulations for single phase flow in adiabatic conditions were used to assist the design of the manifold geometry in the microchannels heat sink. Microfabricated temperature sensors were used together with simultaneous high speed imaging in order to obtain a better insight related to temperature fluctuations caused by two-phase flow instabilities under uniform and non-uniform heating. Two types of two-phase instabilities with flow reversal were identified and classified into flow stability maps. The effect of inlet water temperature on flow boiling instabilities was experimentally studied, with the influence of different subcooling conditions on the magnitude of temperatures as well as the influence on temperature uniformity over the heat sink being assessed. The effect of various hotspot locations on flow boiling instabilities has been investigated, with hotspots located in different positions along the heat sink. Bubble growth and departure size have been experimentally investigated. The results of this study demonstrate that bubble growth in microchannels is different from that in macroscale channels.

50|$|The blue motor was a {{development}} of the earlier red engine, and incorporated several improvements. The biggest of these changes was the complete redesign of the cylinder head; this was now a 12 port design with individual ports for each cylinder. The crankshaft for the 3.3-litre engine now had counterweights on each throw, and stronger connecting rods were used. A two-barrel Varajet carburettor was standard, as was a dual <b>outlet</b> exhaust <b>manifold</b> and a Bosch HEI distributor. It was made in 3.3- and 2.85-litre versions.|$|R
40|$|The flow {{distribution}} in a silicon microchannel heat sink was studied using infrared micro-particle image velocimetry (IR lPIV). The microchannel test piece consisted of seventy-six 110 lm wide Â 371 lm deep channels etched into a silicon substrate. Inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>manifolds,</b> also etched into the substrate, were fed by 1. 4 mm inner-diameter tubing ports. An image-processing algorithm was developed that significantly improves {{the quality of}} IR lPIV recordings in low signal-to-noise ratio environments. A general expression for the PIV measurement depth is presented, which is valid for PIV images that have undergone a threshold image-processing operation. Experiments were performed at two different flow rates: 10 ml/min (Re = 10. 2) and 100 ml/min (Re = 102). Little flow maldistribution was observed at the lower flow rate. However, significant flow maldistribution was observed at Re = 102, with the channels near the center- line having an approximately 30 % greater mass flux than the channels near the lateral edges of the heat sink. Numerical simulations carried out for flow in the microchannel heat sink agreed very well with the experimental measurements, validating {{the use of a}} computational approach for studying the effect of manifold design on flow {{distribution in}} microchannel heat sinks...|$|R
5000|$|The {{only other}} country {{that seems to}} have {{received}} the coupé is Australia, where it was marketed as the [...] "Datsun 1000 Coupé". It was well equipped, and was available only in the Deluxe level of trim. The Australian Deluxe model came standard with many inclusions that were available only as options in the Japanese model. The engine in the coupé had higher compression, a different Hitachi carburettor, and a dual <b>outlet</b> exhaust <b>manifold.</b> These changes increased its power output to a , or 6.5% increase over the lesser models. Unlike the sedans and wagons, the coupé was only ever made in right drive.|$|R
