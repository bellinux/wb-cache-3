5|$|The {{mayor and}} council set local taxes and a budget, {{which must be}} {{approved}} by Congress. The Government Accountability Office and <b>other</b> <b>analysts</b> have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the District's local budget of anywhere between $470million and over $1billion per year. Congress typically provides additional grants for federal programs such as Medicaid and the operation of the local justice system; however, analysts claim that the payments do not fully resolve the imbalance.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his wide}} range of skills, Rodr√≠guez is known for being equally adept at {{defending}} as he is going forward. Although usually a left-back, his size and physique have also seen him be deployed as a centre-back on occasion. Experts consider him as an accomplished defender and note his strong heading ability, as well his personality. He is also considered a continual attacking threat, and has been noted by analysts for his exceptional stamina and pace, which allow for his constant, buccaneering runs up the wing; he has also drawn praise from pundits for rarely conceding careless fouls. Conversely, he has been criticised for giving too much room to opposition attackers, taking up poor positioning and lacking in defensive discipline, while <b>other</b> <b>analysts</b> have criticised his concentration.|$|E

30|$|The {{rating was}} {{conducted}} blind; that is, no information was provided during {{analysis on the}} conditions which the comments belonged to. This was done to avoid possible biases associated with expectations related to the different conditions. However, {{as one of the}} raters was also the moderator of the cases, this rater might remember which comments belonged to which condition. To check this possible source of bias, an additional set of usefulness analyses was run with the usefulness scores obtained only from the <b>other</b> <b>analyst.</b> These additional analyses showed the same pattern as the analyses using the average usefulness scores. The Usefulness scores obtained by the <b>other</b> <b>analyst</b> were only found to be significantly affected (p[*]<[*]. 05) by the Moderator conditions in both cases, but not affected by the Direct view conditions in any of the cases. Thus, we can {{rule out the possibility that}} the analysis of usefulness was biased by analyst expectations.|$|R

5|$|The {{predicted}} {{effects of}} the FairTax {{are a source of}} disagreement among economists and <b>other</b> <b>analysts.</b> According to Money magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a consumption tax, many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a consumption tax (the FairTax is one such tax) would {{have a positive effect on}} economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).|$|E
5|$|On June 19, 2013, Microsoft {{announced}} (in {{response to}} the negative reaction) that it would reverse its changes to Xbox One's DRM and game licensing model. As with Xbox 360, users {{would be able to}} share and resell physical games without restrictions, and beyond a mandatory software update upon the console's initial setup process to enable playback of Blu-ray and DVD video, the console would not require a permanent internet connection to operate. These changes required the family sharing features, along with the ability to play games without their disc after installation, to be dropped. Xbox One chief product officer Marc Whitten stated that the family sharing feature may return in the future, but could not be implemented on launch due to time restraints. Don Mattrick, the then president of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business, stated that the licensing changes were in {{response to the}} negative public reaction. <b>Other</b> <b>analysts</b> believed that the change was in direct response of Sony's aggressive position during its E3 press conference. Mattrick, who had been a leader in Xbox One development, announced his departure from Microsoft on July 1, 2013, to become CEO of Zynga. Analysts speculated that his departure was predicated on the poor response and subsequent reversal of the plans for Xbox One.|$|E

[...] Professor Stephen Saltzburg of George Washington University agreed that the ruling would pressure police to adopt a strategy of [...] "When in doubt, give Miranda warnings", but also opined that it would make little practical difference to young people facing police questioning. [...] "The reality is that even with Miranda warnings, it's doubtful that young people understand exactly what it all means and understand their choices, and so in the long run, I doubt that there will be many fewer confessions because of this opinion." ...|$|E
500|$|On 15 February, a {{statement}} issued from the G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in Moscow affirmed that Japan would not face high level international criticism for its planned monetary policy. In a remark endorsed by US Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, the IMF's managing director Christine Lagarde said that recent concerns about a possible currency war had been [...] "overblown". Paul Krugman has echoed Eichengreen's view that central bank's unconventional monetary policy is best understood as a shared concern to boost growth, not as currency war. Goldman Sachs strategist Kamakshya Trivedi has suggested that rising stock markets imply that market players generally agree that central bank's actions are best understood as monetary easing and not as competitive devaluation. <b>Other</b> <b>analysts</b> have however continued to assert that ongoing tensions over currency valuation remain, with currency war and even trade war still a significant risk. Central bank officials ranging from New Zealand and Switzerland to China have made fresh statements about possible further interventions against their currencies.|$|E
500|$|In early February, ECB {{president}} Mario Draghi {{agreed that}} {{expansionary monetary policy}} like QE have not been undertaken to deliberately cause devaluation. Draghi's statement did however hint that the ECB may take action if the Euro continues to appreciate, and this saw {{the value of the}} European currency fall considerably. A mid February statement from the G7 affirmed the advanced economies commitment to avoid currency war. It was initially read by the markets as an endorsement of Japan's actions, though later clarification suggested the US would like Japan to tone down some of its language, specifically by not linking policies like QE to an expressed desire to devalue the Yen. Most commentators have asserted that if a new round of competitive devaluation occurs it would be harmful for the global economy. [...] However some analysts have stated that Japan's planned actions could be in the long term interests {{of the rest of the}} world; just as he did for the 2010‚Äì11 incident, economist Barry Eichengreen has suggested that even if many other countries start intervening against their currencies it could boost growth worldwide, as the effects would be similar to semi-coordinated global monetary expansion. <b>Other</b> <b>analysts</b> have expressed skepticism about the risk of a war breaking out, with Marc Chandler, chief currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, advising that: [...] "A real currency war remains a remote possibility." ...|$|E

500|$|However, <b>other</b> <b>analysts</b> have {{questioned}} whether the First Circuit's ruling would, in fact, have a widespread impact in the future. For example, {{an article in the}} Harvard Law Review noted that the First Circuit's ruling in Glik was evidence of the court's willingness to protect a [...] "vital First Amendment right", but that [...] "the proliferation of body cameras may make civilians feel as if they no longer need to record officers in the field". Writing for the Florida Law Review, Caycee Hampton criticized the First Circuit for providing [...] "no guidance [...] for [...] determining [...] what [...] situations [...] constitute a [...] 'public [...] space' [...] in which [...] a [...] citizen‚Äôs [...] right [...] to [...] film [...] government [...] officials [...] is [...] safeguarded [...] by the [...] First [...] Amendment", and absent such guidance, [...] "citizens who choose to record law enforcement officials [...] risk [...] inviting [...] the [...] same [...] Fourth [...] Amendment [...] violation [...] confirmed in Glik". Additionally, {{in an article in the}} St. Louis University Law Journal, Justin Welply argued that the right to film the police is not absolute, and that [...] "an individual has a First Amendment right to openly record police conduct in a public park, but does not have an established First Amendment right to openly record officers in the discharge of their duties during a traffic stop" [...] because filming the police during a traffic stop may interfere with their ability to work effectively.|$|E
500|$|Analysts {{believed}} that while {{this was a}} major victory for the video game industry, the challenge is not yet over. Dan Offner, a partner for the video game industry analysis firm Loeb & Loeb {{believed that}} similar laws and regulations will be sought by State and Federal governments, as [...] "the regulation of mature content with respect to minors as a hot button issue for the Federal Trade Commission and the various state governments." [...] <b>Other</b> <b>analysts</b> cited that as more game content becomes available online as opposed to retail channels, the focus may shift more towards [...] "privacy and security" [...] of children and preventing children from amassing large fees from pay-to-use gaming services, pointing to a $3 million settlement that Playdom {{had to pay for}} violating privacy of its younger users. Sean Bersell of the EMA noted that future debates over violent video games may involve public opinion in addition to new legislation, noting that [...] "Retailers along with publishers and parents all have a role in keeping kids away from these games." [...] Seth Schiesel of the New York Times proposed that the Court's decision should be a challenge to the industry to show that they can mature on the decision that video games are a form of art, questioning the industry [...] "Will you use it as cover to pump out schlock or will you rise to the opportunity and respectability that has been afforded you?" [...] Schiesel also considered that even if games with increased interactivity and reality may make the games more dangerous, this could also make the player more aware of the potential consequences of his or her actions, even when such an action is made with the purpose to gain points/level or to kill a [...] "dangerous enemy" [...] in that game.|$|E
