5|$|There {{are three}} {{political}} institutions which hold {{the executive and}} legislative power of the Union. The Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> represents governments, the Parliament represents citizens and the Commission represents the European interest.

The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the Parliament and the Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Union,</b> where in most cases both must give their assent. Although {{the exact nature of}} this depends upon the legislative procedure in use, once it is approved and signed by both bodies it becomes law.
