40|$|Composite {{coatings}} {{consisting of}} a metal matrix in which ceramic particles are embedded have recently been developed and used in industry as wear-resistant coatings. The present paper deals {{with the development of}} <b>oil-containing</b> self-lubricating metallic coatings. These have been produced by electrolytic codeposition of <b>oil-containing</b> microcapsules from Watts nickel plating baths. For this purpose, <b>oil-containing</b> polyterephthalamide microcapsules were synthesized based on the interfacial polymerization of an oil-soluble monomer (terephthaloyl dichloride) and a mixture of two water-soluble monomers (diethylenetriamine and 1, 6 -hexamethylenediamine). The influence of several synthesis parameters (e. g. type of encapsulated organic phase, monomer concentration(s) and concentration ratio of the two amine monomers) on the size distribution and morphology of the <b>oil-containing</b> polyamide microcapsules as well as on their electrolytic codeposition behaviour is discussed. As revealed by scanning electron microscopy analysis, the morphological characteristics of the microcapsules were affected to a great extent by the functionality of the water-soluble amine monomer. Furthermore, the composition of the core material of the microcapsules showed a marked influence on their stability upon aging in the Watts nickel plating bath. Finally, codeposition experiments using a laboratory rotating electrode showed that the level of codeposition was influenced by the presence of additives in the nickel electrolyte and was strongly dependent on the polymerization conditions employed in the microcapsule synthesis. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{effectiveness}} of Achillea ligustica essential oils against several oral microorganisms in comparison with a commercial essential <b>oil-containing</b> mouthrinse (Listerine (R)) and clove oil (containing 89 % eugenol).

The antiseptic mouthwash Listerine (R) did not exert a strong inhibition on microbial strains tested, whereas its effectiveness increased significantly when essential oil was added.

Wheat flour breads fortified with freeze-dried carrot, tomato, beetroot or broccoli were developed and assessed for their nutritional composition, antioxidant potential, oxidative stability, and storage properties. Using a simulated in vitro model, the study also examined the impact of vegetable addition on the oxidative stability of macronutrients during gastro-intestinal digestion. Adding vegetables improved the nutritional and functional attributes of the oil-free breads. However, they demonstrated a lower antioxidant potential compared to their <b>oil-containing</b> counterparts. Similarly, the textural and storage properties of the oil-free vegetable breads were poorer compared to the <b>oil-containing</b> breads. As expected, in the absence of oil the oil-free breads were associated with lower lipid oxidation both in their fresh form and during gastro-intestinal digestion. Adding vegetables reduced protein oxidation in the fresh oil-free breads but had no effect during gastro-intestinal digestion. The impact of vegetables on macronutrient oxidation in the oil-free breads during digestion appears to be vegetable-specific with broccoli exacerbating it and the others having no effect.
