5|$|During the 1980s {{very few}} {{specialized}} digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis <b>on</b> <b>media,</b> examining computers {{from within the}} operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.|$|E

There was never an explanation for this decision offered by the French government, even after Avro tried to offer the Iroquois as a private venture.|$|E

5|$|Some {{two hours}} after the court made its initial {{judgment}} in favour of van der Garde, the FIA published an entry list for the Australian Grand Prix that included both Nasr and Ericsson for Sauber following pre-event scrutineering. Despite this, neither driver took to the circuit during the first practice session on the Friday due to Sauber running {{the risk of having}} team assets seized for not complying with court orders. Nevertheless, based <b>on</b> <b>media</b> speculation about Bernie Ecclestone's intervention to avoid further negative publicity on the sport, Ericsson and Nasr did participate in that afternoon's second practice session. On Saturday, 14 March 2015, the dispute reached a temporary resolution thanks to van der Garde announcing that he would forego racing in Melbourne, with a view to finding a more permanent solution in the future. The Sauber team and its new drivers for 2015 were thus able to complete Saturday's qualifying session and a point-scoring race on the Sunday.|$|E
5|$|With the Wizards of the Coast {{relaunch}} in 1998 the contents, under editor Kim Mohan, {{became more}} media-focused. The initial {{plan was to}} {{have two or three}} stories per issue based on films, TV, and games.

The Paizo publishing relaunch, in 2004, was even more focused <b>on</b> <b>media</b> content than the Wizards of the Coast version had been, with much more movie and comics-related material than science fiction. Several well-known authors appeared in the first issue, including Harlan Ellison, Bruce Sterling, and Gene Wolfe. Paizo also ran a blog for the magazine. The fiction received positive reviews, but Paizo soon put the magazine on temporary hold, and canceled it permanently the following year.|$|E
5|$|Clough was {{appointed}} as manager at Third Division Brighton & Hove Albion on 1 November 1973, with Taylor joining as his assistant. Just after the pair were appointed, the team lost 4–0 {{at home to}} Walton & Hersham in an FA Cup replay and then 8–2 at home to Bristol Rovers on 1 December. Brighton finished 19th in the final table in the 1973–74 season, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Fourth Division, and the pair began to rebuild the team by signing Peter Grummitt, Andy Rollings, Ian Mellor, Steve Govier, and Ken Goodewe; Taylor felt that Clough never settled at Brighton however, and {{spent too much time}} away <b>on</b> <b>media</b> commitments. Clough left for Leeds United in July 1974, but Taylor refused to go with Clough as he felt Brighton and club chairman Mike Bamber had treated them well, and so the partnership ended after nine years as Taylor stayed at the Goldstone Ground as sole manager. He went on to sign striker Peter Ward and midfielder Brian Horton, but admitted that both he and Clough were much more effective as a duo; he felt that he had struggled to make the good players he signed play to their full potential whilst feeling that Clough had bought and sold poorly as Leeds manager. He stayed on at the South coast club for a further two seasons, guiding the team to a fourth-place finish in 1975–76, missing promotion by two points. His successor, Alan Mullery, managed to lead the team Taylor left behind to promotion in 1976–77 and then into the top-flight in 1978–79.|$|E
40|$|Posting {{consumption}} items <b>on</b> social <b>media</b> {{has become}} a common consumer behavior. It represents {{a new type of}} word-of-mouth activity. This dissertation investigates the factors that contribute to consumption-related posting behavior (CPB) <b>on</b> social <b>media</b> and the influences of such behavior on how consumers enjoy their purchases. It offers evidence from six studies in support of a framework incorporating the antecedents and consequences of CPB <b>on</b> social <b>media.</b> Antecedents – intrinsic enjoyment of using social media, the motivation to express oneself through word-of-mouth and purchase type – positively predict the posting behavior. Experiential purchases {{are more likely to be}} posted than material purchases. Materialism, however, moderates the effects of purchase type on posting. Specifically, lower-materialism consumers are more likely to post experiential purchases than material purchases, while higher-materialism consumers tend to post both types of purchases. For the consequences of CPB <b>on</b> social <b>media,</b> materialism is found to be a moderator interacting with CPB <b>on</b> social <b>media</b> to influence consumers’ enjoyment with their purchases. CPB <b>on</b> social <b>media</b> leads lower-materialism consumers to enjoy their purchases more; on the other hand, CPB <b>on</b> social <b>media</b> does not have such effects on higher-materialism consumers. Moreover, CPB <b>on</b> social <b>media</b> influences enjoyment with purchase through the purchase’s impact on self and interpersonal relationship. This dissertation makes significant contributions to the research <b>on</b> word-of-mouth, social <b>media</b> as well as materialism. It provides important managerial implications as well. ...|$|R
