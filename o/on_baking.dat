500|$|Its successor, How to be a Domestic Goddess (2000), focuses {{primarily}} <b>on</b> <b>baking.</b> Of {{this second}} bestseller, The Times wrote of Lawson's book, that it [...] "is defined by its intimate, companionable approach. She is not issuing matronly instructions like Delia; she is merely making sisterly suggestions". Lawson rejected feminist criticism of her book, adding that [...] "ome people did take the domestic goddess title literally rather than ironically. It {{was about the}} pleasures of feeling like one rather than actually being one." [...] The book sold 180,000 copies in four months, and won Lawson the title of Author of the Year at the British Book Awards in 2001, fending off competition from authors such as J. K. Rowling. How to Eat and How to be a Domestic Goddess {{were published in the}} U.S. in 2000 and 2001. As a result of the book's success, The Observer took her on as a social affairs columnist.|$|E

The company created yeast that would rise twice as fast, cutting down <b>on</b> <b>baking</b> time. Lesaffre would later create instant yeast in the 1970s, which has gained considerable use and market share at the expense of both fresh and dry yeast in their various applications.|$|E

2500|$|McBride Industrial District is {{the area}} {{incorporating}} the McBride Industrial Park located between Fair Lawn Borough's border with Glen Rock and the Chandler Houses and Fair Lawn Commons communities. It currently houses the former Nabisco cookie factory, which has {{played a major role}} in not only Fair Lawn's identity itself, but also Glen Rock, Ridgewood, Paterson, Prospect Park, Haledon, Hawthorne, and Western Paramus near the Dunkerhook and Saddle River Areas, causing those venturing throughout these areas to coin the nickname [...] "Cookie-City" [...] as a general area term, describing the fragrance of freshly baked cookies that filled these areas <b>on</b> <b>baking</b> days. In the past, the McBride Industrial District took up both sides of Route 208, stretching from Fair Lawn Avenue to the intersection at Maple Avenue and Harristown Road, running up to the Bergen County Line train tracks via the Radburn District, and housing companies such as Nabisco, Kodak, Maxell, and others. More recently the district has been in the process of deindustrialization and corporate gentrification, as older companies fold or move out, replacing industrial properties with residential-commercial [...] "mini-cities", as well as the headquarters of New Jersey's Columbia Savings Bank.|$|E

60|$|In her misery she rocked herself {{upon the}} bed. The clock struck the solemn hour of one, that hour when fancy stalks outside reason, and {{malignant}} possibilities stand rock-firm as facts. She {{thought of the}} child consigned to the nethermost corner of hell, as its double doom for lack of baptism and lack of legitimacy; saw the arch-fiend tossing it with his three-pronged fork, like the one they used for heating the oven <b>on</b> <b>baking</b> days; to which picture she added many other quaint and curious details of torment sometimes taught the young in this Christian country. The lurid presentment so powerfully affected her imagination {{in the silence of}} the sleeping house that her nightgown became damp with perspiration, and the bedstead shook with each throb of her heart.|$|E

60|$|Some days went by pleasantly for Hare, as {{he rested}} from his long exertions. Naab's former cheer {{and that of}} his family reasserted itself once the {{decision}} was made, and the daily life went on as usual. The sons worked in the fields by day, and in the evening played at pitching horseshoes on the bare circle where the children romped. The women went <b>on</b> <b>baking,</b> sewing, and singing. August Naab's prayers were more fervent than ever, and he even prayed for the soul of the man who had robbed him. Mescal's cheeks soon rounded out to their old contour and her eyes shone with a happier light than Hare had ever seen there. The races between Silvermane and Black Bolly were renewed on the long stretch under the wall, and Mescal forgot that she had once acknowledged the superiority of the gray. The cottonwoods showered silken floss till the cabins and grass were white; the birds returned to the oasis; the sun kissed warm color into the cherries, and the distant noise of the river seemed like the humming of a swarm of bees.|$|E
60|$|I {{have been}} {{entering}} {{much more than}} my silly silence represents into the sequel of your return to London, and not less into the sequel of that. Please believe in my affectionate participation as regards the Bezly Thorne consultation and whatever emotion it may have excited in either of you. To that emotion I hope the healing waters have already applied the most cooling, soothing, softening douche--or administered a not less beneficent draught if the enjoyment of them has had in fact to be more inward. I congratulate you on the decision you so speedily took and, with your usual Napoleonic celerity when {{the surface of the}} globe is in question, so energetically acted upon. I trust you are, in short, really settled for a while among rustling German woods and plashing German waters. (Those are really, for the most part, my own main impressions of Germany--the memory of ancient summers there at more or less bosky Bäder, or other Kur-orten, involving a great deal of open air strolling in the shade and sitting under trees.) This particular dose of Deutschland will, I feel, really have been more favourable to you than your having had to swallow the Teuton-element {{in the form of the}} cookery, or of any other of the manifold attributes, of the robust fausse anglaise whom I here so confoundingly revealed to you. Let it console you also a little that you would have had to bear, as well, with that burden, a temperature that the particular conditions of the house I showed you would not have done much to minimise. I have been grilled, but I have borne it better for not feeling that I had put you also on the stove. Rye goes <b>on</b> <b>baking,</b> this amazing summer, but, though I suppose the heat is everywhere, you have a more refreshing regimen. I pray for the happiest and most marked results from it.|$|E
