5|$|That May, RKO {{released}} Citizen Kane, coproducing with director Orson Welles's Mercury Productions. While {{it opened}} to strong reviews and {{would go on}} to be hailed {{as one of the greatest}} movies ever made, it lost money at the time and brought down the wrath of the Hearst newspaper chain on RKO. The next year saw the commercial failure of Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons—like Kane, critically lauded and overbudget—and the expensive embarrassment of his aborted documentary It's All True. The three Mercury productions combined to drain $2 million from the RKO coffers, major money for a corporation that had reported an <b>overall</b> <b>deficit</b> of $1 million in 1940 and a nominal profit of a bit more than $500,000 in 1941. Many of RKO's other artistically ambitious pictures were also dying at the box office and it was losing its last exclusive deal with a major star as well. Rogers, after winning an Oscar in 1941 for her performance in the previous year's Kitty Foyle, held out for a freelance contract like Grant's; after 1943, she would appear in just one more RKO production, thirteen years later. On June 17, 1942, Schaefer tendered his resignation. He departed a weakened and troubled studio, but RKO was about to turn the corner. Propelled by the box-office boom of World War II and guided by new management, RKO would make a strong comeback over the next half-decade.|$|E

We understand the institutionalization of political organizations as progress in four dimensions: roots in society, level of organization, autonomy, and coherence. On this basis we construct an Index of the Institutionalization of Parties (IIP), which we apply to 28 African political parties. The IIP uses extensive GIGA survey and fieldwork data. Initial results reveal a more differentiated degree of institutionalization than is commonly assumed.

2500|$|Even {{from the}} time of the famine, it was debated whether the crisis was caused by a crop {{shortfall}} in the aman harvest of late 1942 or by a failure in distribution of a rice harvest which was nearly sufficient to feed the populace of Bengal. The most influential and widely accepted analysis belongs to Amartya Sen, who concluded: [...] "The current [...] supply for 1943 was only about 5% lower than the average of the preceding five years. It was, in fact, 13% higher than in 1941, and there was, of course, no famine in 1941." [...] The Famine Commission Report concluded that the <b>overall</b> <b>deficit</b> in rice in Bengal in 1943, taking into account an estimate of the amount of carryover of rice from the previous harvest, was about three weeks supply. Even under normal circumstances, this would have been a significant shortfall requiring a considerable amount of food relief, but not a deficit large enough to create widespread deaths by starvation. According to this view, the famine [...] "was not a crisis of food availability, but of the [...] distribution of food and income." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{sustainability of}} Croatia 2 ̆ 7 s public and external debt {{with the help}} of standard indicators used by international financial institutions, investment banks and rating agencies. It is shown that a thorough sustainability analysis requires the use of a whole range of indicators. By contrast, only few summary measures - such as gross public and external debt and their shares in GDP - are currently usually used in discussions of debt issues in Croatia. Against this background, the paper derives other standard indicators of debt sustainability, such as debt stabilising primary and <b>overall</b> <b>deficits</b> of general government. It is further argued that threshold at which debt sustainability becomes a problem differs across periods and countries, and depends on the perceptions and expectations of financial market participants.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the fiscal behaviour of EU countries in 1972 - 1999. It {{attempts to find}} out how deficits adjust to changes in interest rates and output growth by examining the hypothesis that the reaction of deficits to output growth is non-linear: relatively small in "good times" and quite substantial in depressions. This hypothesis is tested using pooled cross-country data for 14 EU countries. All test results give support for the hypothesis, which suggests that nonlinearity is an essential ingredient of the fiscal policy transmission mechanism. The paper also discusses some explanations and policy implications of this finding. It is also found that <b>overall</b> <b>deficits</b> are quite sensitive to output fluctuations. This result appears to be quite robust in terms of different model specifications and estimation methods. The sensitiveness seems {{to be related to the}} size of the public sector.

40|$|Abstract. Changes of {{nutrient}} cycle and balance in agricultural ecosystem will bring heavy impacts {{not only on}} land production, but also on ecological and environmental condition. We studied on the balances of main nutrients (carbon, nitrogen and phosphor) and their long-term changes in a typical arable ecosystem in North China, based on the resource data got from household surveys combined with land use data derived from remote sensing imagery. The results show that C and N balances of large-scale irrigated land changed from deficits in 1945 into great surpluses in 2002, respectively, and P surpluses also doubled in 2002. C, N and P balances in overall arable ecosystem showed significant surpluses despite of decreased total arable area after 60 years. Contrarily, C and N fluxes of arable landscape in 1945 showed <b>overall</b> <b>deficits.</b> Nutrient balance changes of arable lands were impacted mainly by anthropogenic factors such as fertilizer input, land productivity crop residue utility and land use...|$|R
40|$|Historical {{conceptualizations of}} psychopathic {{personality}} emphasized affective deficits as {{characteristic of the}} disorder. Contemporary research reports deficits in facial emotion recognition, with particularly strong effects for recognition of fearful faces. Researchers have proposed a number of theories to explain the interaction between psychopathic traits and emotion processing deficits. The response modulation hypothesis emphasizes deficits in shifting attention from goal-directed behavior, whereas the Integrated Emotions System model emphasizes deficits in moral socialization due to abnormalities in fear processing. The current research investigated whether individuals elevated in psychopathic traits displayed deficits in recognizing emotion <b>overall,</b> <b>deficits</b> specific to fear recognition, and/or deficits in attention to fearful faces. A sample of 110 undergraduate students completed the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure, a facial emotion recognition task, and a visual dot probe task. Participants relatively elevated in psychopathic traits also completed an attentional retraining task to determine if their attention {{could be directed to}} fearful faces. Finally, an ASL Eye-Trac 6 eye-tracker was used to investigate whether gaze fixations on the eyes or the mouth of an emotional face were associated with deficits in emotion processing. Accuracy of emotion identification was recorded for each participant. Additionally, a facilitation index was calculated for the dot probe task to measure attentional orientating to emotional stimuli. Contrary to hypotheses, individuals elevated in psychopathic traits did not display <b>overall</b> <b>deficits</b> in identification of emotional faces overall or for fear faces specifically. Results indicated that individuals elevated in psychopathic traits displayed deficits in identifying disgusted faces. As hypothesized, reduced response time to fearful faces in the dot probe task was associated with elevations in psychopathic traits. However, the attentional retraining task did not increase attention to fearful faces. Finally, deficits in emotion recognition and emotional attention were not associated with eye gaze. The results suggest that psychopathy may not be universally associated with emotion recognition performance. Instead, deficient emotion processing in psychopathic individuals may be due to attentional deficits rather than inability to identify emotional facial expressions. Interpretations of these results are limited by small sample size and the use of an undergraduate student sample...|$|R
