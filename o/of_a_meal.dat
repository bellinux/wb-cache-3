5|$|Symptoms {{can begin}} to {{manifest}} at any point from the ingestion of the meal to 120minutes thereafter. However, the more common range is between 30seconds to 1hour after the completion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>meal.</b> Symptoms tend to cease when the ruminated contents become acidic.|$|E
5|$|Gastroparesis {{is another}} common misdiagnosis. Like {{rumination}} syndrome, patients with gastroparesis often bring up food following the ingestion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>meal.</b> Unlike rumination, gastroparesis causes vomiting (in contrast to regurgitation) of food, {{which is not}} being digested further, from the stomach. This vomiting occurs several hours after a meal is ingested, preceded by nausea and retching, and has the bitter or sour taste typical of vomit.|$|E

5|$|While {{the number}} and {{severity}} of symptoms varies among individuals, repetitive regurgitation of undigested food (known as rumination) after the start <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>meal</b> is always present. In some individuals, the regurgitation is small, occurring {{over a long period}} of time following ingestion, and can be rechewed and swallowed. In others, the amount can be bilious and short lasting, and must be expelled.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} is diagnosed {{based on a}} complete history of the individual. Costly and invasive studies such as gastroduodenal manometry and esophageal Ph testing are unnecessary and will often aid in misdiagnosis. Based on typical observed features, several criteria have been suggested for diagnosing rumination syndrome. The primary symptom, the regurgitation of recently ingested food, must be consistent, occurring for at least sixweeks of the past twelve months. The regurgitation must begin within 30minutes of the completion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>meal.</b> Patients may either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it. The symptoms must stop within 90minutes, or when the regurgitated matter becomes acidic. The symptoms must not {{be the result of}} a mechanical obstruction, and should not respond to the standard treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Macedonia {{produced}} {{only a few}} fine foods or beverages that were highly appreciated elsewhere in the Greek world, including eels from the Strymonian Gulf and special wine produced in Chalcidice. The earliest known use of flat bread as a plate for meat was made in Macedonia during the 3rdcenturyBC, which perhaps influenced the later trencher bread of medieval Europe. Cattle and goats were consumed, {{although there was no}} notice of Macedonian mountain cheeses in literature until the Middle Ages. The comedic playwright Menander wrote that Macedonian dining habits penetrated Athenian high society; for instance, the introduction of meats into the dessert course <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>meal.</b> The Macedonians also most likely introduced mattye to Athenian cuisine, a dish usually made of chicken or other spiced, salted, and sauced meats served during the wine course. This particular dish was derided and connected with licentiousness and drunkenness in a play by the Athenian comic poet Alexis about the declining morals of Athenians in the age of Demetrius I of Macedon.|$|E

40|$|Background Small {{intestinal}} and oro-cecal {{transit time}} (OCTT) is determined for clinical diagnostics and research purposes. Experimental protocols used vary {{with respect to}} the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subsequent <b>meal</b> during the test period. This study was conducted to elucidate whether the ingestion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subsequent <b>meal</b> during the test period influences the OCTT of the test meal. Materials and methods The OCTT <b>of</b> <b>a</b> liquid test <b>meal,</b> measured with the lactose-[C- 13]ureide breath test, was compared between four groups of healthy volunteers (n = 36) who consumed the subsequent meal at different time points. Also, the OCTT was determined twice in eight subjects; <b>a</b> subsequent <b>meal</b> was ingested after 180 min (test A) and after 360 min (test B). Results An apparently meal-related increase in median OCTT was observed. The OCTT of the eight volunteers measured in test A (210; 210 - 349 median; quartiles) was significantly shorter than that found in test B (345; 300 - 375 min, P = 0. 016). <b>As</b> result <b>of</b> the ingestion of the subsequent meal at 180 min the OCTT was shortened by 90; 64 - 116 min in 7 / 8 subjects. Conclusion These data indicate that the ingestion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subsequent <b>meal</b> affects the OCTT <b>of</b> <b>a</b> liquid test <b>meal.</b> This phenomenon could be explained by the increased intestinal motility in response to <b>a</b> <b>meal,</b> and should be taken into account when designing protocols for measurements of the OCTT and in the interpretation of small intestinal absorption studies...|$|R
25|$|Goatfish are tireless benthic feeders, using {{a pair of}} long chemosensory barbels (whiskers) {{protruding}} from their chins to rifle through the sediments in search <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>meal.</b> Like goats, they seek anything edible: worms, crustaceans, molluscs and other small invertebrates are staples. The yellowfin goatfish (Mulloidichthys vanicolensis) often schools with the blue-striped snapper. The yellowfins change their colouration to match that of the snapper. Presumably this is for predator protection, since goatfish are a more preferred prey than bluestripe snapper. By night the schools disperse and individual goatfish head their separate ways to loot the sands. Other nocturnal feeders shadow the active goatfish, waiting patiently for overlooked morsels.|$|E
25|$|Wine is {{a popular}} and {{important}} beverage that accompanies and enhances {{a wide range of}} cuisines, from the simple and traditional stews to the most sophisticated and complex haute cuisines. Wine is often served with dinner. Sweet dessert wines may be served with the dessert course. In fine restaurants in Western countries, wine typically accompanies dinner. At a restaurant, patrons are helped to make good food-wine pairings by the restaurant's sommelier or wine waiter. Individuals dining at home may use wine guides to help make food–wine pairings. Wine is also drunk without the accompaniment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>meal</b> in wine bars or with a selection of cheeses (at a wine and cheese party).|$|E
25|$|One such dish is mais moulu (mayi moulen), {{which is}} {{comparable}} to grits that can be eaten with sauce pois (sòs pwa), a bean purée made from one of many types of beans such as kidney, pinto, chickpeas, or pigeon peas (known in some countries as gandules). Mais moulin can be eaten with fish (often red snapper), or alone depending on personal preference. Some of the many plants used in Haitian dishes include tomato, oregano, cabbage, avocado, bell peppers. A popular food is banane pesée (ban-nan'n peze), flattened plantain slices fried in cooking oil (known as tostones in the Spanish-speaking Latin American countries). It is eaten both as a snack and as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>meal,</b> and is often eaten with tassot and griot (deep-fried goat and pork).|$|E

40|$|Although {{research}} {{addresses the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>meal’s</b> context on food preference, the psychological consequences of meal situations are largely unexplored. We compared {{the cognitive and}} emotional effects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> restaurant <b>meal</b> eaten in the company <b>of</b> others to <b>a</b> solitary <b>meal</b> consumed in <b>a</b> plain office using pre- and post-tests analysis and controlling for the kind and amount of food consumed. Three tasks were conducted, measuring: (1) semantic memory (2) cognitive control and error monitoring, and (3) processing of emotional facial expressions. Covert processes in these tasks were assessed with event-related brain potentials. A mood rating questionnaire indicated <b>a</b> relaxation effect <b>of</b> the restaurant {{as compared to the}} plain meal situation. The restaurant meal increased sensitivity to threatening facial expressions and diminished cognitive control and error monitoring. No effects were observed for semantic memory. These findings provide the first experimental evidence that <b>a</b> restaurant <b>meal</b> with <b>a</b> social component may be more relaxing than <b>a</b> <b>meal</b> eaten alone in a plain setting and may reduce cognitive control...|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} body postures may be assumed, often with {{specific}} meaning (mainly respect or adoration) associated with them: standing; sitting; kneeling; prostrate on the floor; eyes opened; eyes closed; hands folded or clasped; hands upraised; holding hands with others; a laying on of hands and others. Prayers may be recited from memory, read {{from a book}} of prayers, or composed spontaneously as they are prayed. They may be said, chanted, or sung. They may be with musical accompaniment or not. There may {{be a time of}} outward silence while prayers are offered mentally. Often, there are prayers to fit specific occasions, such as the blessing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>meal,</b> the birth or death of a loved one, other significant events {{in the life of a}} believer, or days of the year that have special religious significance.

25|$|In Pakistan, {{main courses}} are usually served with wheat bread (either roti or naan) or rice. Salad is {{generally}} {{taken as a}} side dish with the main course, rather than as an appetizer beforehand. Assorted fresh fruit or sometimes desserts are consumed at the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>meal.</b> Meat plays a much more dominant role in Pakistani food, compared to other South Asian cuisines. According to a 2003 report, an average Pakistani consumed three times more meat than an average Indian. Of all the meats, the most popular are goat, mutton, beef and chicken, which are particularly sought after as the meats of choice for kebab dishes or the classic beef shank dish nihari. Seafood is generally not consumed in large amounts, though it is very popular in the coastal areas of Sindh and the Makran coast of Balochistan and was a dominant element of the cuisine of the former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).|$|E
25|$|Two {{months after}} the {{attempted}} murder of Ho, on 3 December 1979, Nilsen encountered a 23-year-old Canadian student named Kenneth Ockenden, {{who had been on}} a tour of England visiting relatives. Nilsen encountered Ockenden as they both drank in a West End pub. Upon learning the youth was a tourist, Nilsen offered to show Ockenden several notable London landmarks; an offer which Ockenden accepted. Nilsen then invited the youth to his house on the promise <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>meal</b> and further drinks. The pair stopped at an off licence en route to Nilsen's Melrose Avenue residence and purchased whisky, rum and beer, with Ockenden insisting on sharing the bill. Although Nilsen was adamant he could not recall the precise moment he strangled Ockenden, he recalled that he strangled the youth with the cord of his (Nilsen's) headphones as Ockenden listened to music; he also recalled dragging the youth across his floor with the wire wrapped around his neck as he strangled him, before pouring himself half a glass of rum and continuing to listen to music upon the headphones with which he had strangled Ockenden.|$|E
