50|$|On October 14, 1978, H.R. 1337 {{was signed}} into law, which legalized the home {{production}} of {{a small amount of}} beer or wine for personal consumption. Since then, the United States has witnessed a resurgence of brewing culture and the widespread proliferation <b>of</b> small <b>breweries.</b> By March 1986, five brewpubs had opened in the United States. The total number <b>of</b> <b>breweries</b> rose from 42 in 1978 to over 2,750 in 2012, reaching or exceeding the number <b>of</b> <b>breweries</b> estimated to have existed during the colonial period.

40|$|Beer is {{the fifth}} most {{consumed}} beverage in the world. The brewing industry {{is one of the}} largest users of water. Even though substantial technological improvements have been made in the past, it has been documented that approximately 3 to 10 litres of wastewater is generated per litre of beer. The crops tested for management <b>of</b> <b>brewery</b> wastewater were maize, sunflower and sesame which had the characteristics of fast growth, high salinity tolerance; potential for producing commercial products such as food grains along with the remediation capability without affecting the food grade. The brewery wastewater was colourless and odourless with neutral in reaction (7. 05) having an EC of 1. 96 dS m- 1. Therefore, the potential <b>of</b> <b>brewery</b> wastewater as an irrigation source for crop production was assessed through pot culture and field experiments. In the pot culture studies, the growth parameters like plant height, stem girth, number of leaves, leaf area, total chlorophyll content, proline, soluble protein and biomass production of maize, sunflower and sesame performed better at higher concentration <b>of</b> <b>brewery</b> wastewater irrigation. The soil enzyme activities showed that increasing the concentration of wastewater lead to increase in enzyme activities <b>of</b> <b>brewery</b> wastewater irrigated soil...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} on farmers' field in sofi district of Harari Regional State during 2013 / 2014 main cropping season, eastern Ethiopia, to investigate the impact <b>of</b> <b>brewery</b> sludge on sorghum production and soil fertility. The treatments comprised seven levels <b>of</b> <b>brewery</b> sludges (0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0, 12. 5 and 15. 0 t ha- 1) and NP inorganic fertilizer at recommended rate, arranged in randomized complete block design with four replications. Application <b>of</b> <b>brewery</b> sludge at 15 t ha- 1 significantly increased the yield and biomass yield of sorghum by 79 and 85 % over control and by 57 and 67 % over NP application, respectively. There was no effect <b>of</b> <b>brewery</b> sludge application on heavy metals concentrations in soil after crop harvest, compared to international standard tolerable level. Co and Se levels were high in the control {{as well as in}} the soils treated with brewery sludge indicating the already high concentration of these heavy metals in the soils of the area. Plots, which received higher brewery sludge application, resulted in decreased or less percentage of grain nitrogen content showing the independence of grain protein content on lower brewery sludge level. The nitrogen uptake by sorghum grain, straw and the total was maximum (52. 68, 44. 25 and 79. 03 kg ha- 1, respectively) with the application <b>of</b> <b>brewery</b> waste sludge at 10 and 15 t ha- 1 which were significantly higher than the other brewery sludge and NP mineral fertilizer applications...|$|R

40|$|Thesis of {{qualitative}} character {{deals with the}} strategy at the business level. The aim of the thesis was to compare two breweries {{from the point of}} view of the declared business strategy, the declared strategies to be ranked among the business strategies according to literary research, and to verify the actual fulfillment of the declared strategies <b>of</b> the selected <b>breweries.</b> The verification took place in terms of price level, method and level <b>of</b> distribution. Two <b>breweries</b> operating in the territory of the Czech Republic, in the Pardubice region, were selected for the survey. It was the Municipal Brewery in Polička, a. s. and the Brewery Rychtář, a. s., Hlinsko v Čechách. It was targeted at the management <b>of</b> <b>breweries.</b> Qualitative methods were used to collect data, including qualitative interviewing with the above-mentioned research sample, texts and documents, and field research supplemented by web pages. Subsequently, obtained data was analyzed, interpreted and evaluated. On the basis of the stated goal, the declared strategy <b>of</b> selected <b>breweries</b> was established. According to the literary research, Porter's generic strategies have been used as a type of strategy used in all the selected literature to incorporate the strategy <b>of</b> <b>breweries.</b> The declared strategy <b>of</b> <b>breweries</b> was tended to a differentiation strategy aimed at a wide range of customers. Subsequently, the real fulfillment of the declared business strategy <b>of</b> each <b>brewery</b> was verified. It was found that the declared strategy was largely in agreement with its fulfillment, for both selected breweries. There were no significant differences for each <b>brewery.</b> The benefit <b>of</b> this work was mainly focused on the management <b>of</b> selected <b>breweries,</b> who did not think about their strategies in this way...|$|R

40|$|The impact <b>of</b> <b>brewery</b> {{wastewater}} discharge on sulfide and methane {{production in}} a sewer was assessed. Experiments {{were carried out}} on laboratory scale sewer reactors consisting of both an experimental and a control reactor. The control reactor was intermittently fed with real fresh sewage while the experimental reactor was fed with a mixture <b>of</b> <b>brewery</b> and domestic wastewater at two different proportions (10 and 25 % v/v). 10 % v/v discharge <b>of</b> <b>brewery</b> wastewater increased the H 2 S and CH 4 production rates in the sewer reactor by 40 % and 30 %, respectively. When the brewery wastewater fraction was increased to 25 % v/v, the H 2 S production rate of the experimental reactor decreased {{to the level of}} the control reactor. In contrast, the CH 4 production rate maintained at a level that was 30 % higher than that in the control reactor. These results indicate that the discharge <b>of</b> <b>brewery</b> wastewater into sewers can give negative impacts in relation to odour and corrosion management of the systems and will increase the greenhouse gas emissions from sewers. The study also reveals that the impact of trade waste on the biological reactions in sewers is complex, and requires careful experimental assessment in each case...|$|R
