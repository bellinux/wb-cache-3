5|$|Mining in Mine 1b was {{terminated}} in 1958, but operation in Mine 5 started the following year. Preliminary work <b>on</b> <b>Mine</b> 4 started in 1954, and from 1960 {{it was used}} as a reserve mine. The Norwegian Air Force started serving Longyearbyen with postal flights in the 1950s. In 1959, a man fell seriously ill, so a landing strip was prepared in Adventdalen. From the same year, Braathens SAFE started serving the tundra airport with irregular winter flights. In 1957, a principal was hired at the primary school and a new church was opened on 24 August 1958. From 1961, the primary school was supplemented by a private middle school. A branch of Tromsø Sparebank opened in 1959.|$|E

25|$|This initial work, {{together}} with subsequent similar evaluations, led Jeffress {{to the development}} of a mine-hunting technique known as clustering. He first used data collected at sea to develop the technique, he then proceeded to use numerical models (which involved random number theory), and finally developed a theoretical model (in closed analytical form). The Navy readily accepted his work and requested that he write the tactical doctrine on clustering. This document, {{together with}} other reports he wrote, remained the standard works <b>on</b> <b>mine</b> hunting and were still to be found on every mine-hunting craft in the US Fleet at Jeffress' death.|$|E

While being interviewed by Digital Spy Cruz explained how the cover initially came about and his view on the cover, [...] "she asked me if she could do a version of the song where she sang the first verse and I thought that was a really cool idea. I really like both versions, and it's good that there are these two different versions out there, because fans of me get more of me <b>on</b> <b>mine</b> and [...] fans get more of her on hers." ...|$|E

500|$|Still {{during the}} race, the {{stewards}} handed Nico Hülkenberg a three-place grid penalty {{for the following}} race in Japan for causing the collision with Felipe Massa on lap 14. Hülkenberg was [...] "frustrated" [...] with the decision, saying: [...] "The accident with Felipe was very unlucky and I don't understand why I've been given a penalty before there has even been the chance to discuss the incident in the stewards' room [...] In my view it was my corner and I'm surprised Felipe backed out of it much too late, locking up just before he hit me." [...] Massa had a different view about the incident, stating: [...] "I was braking for the corner and he turned his car in <b>on</b> <b>mine,</b> leaving me with nowhere to go, so we hit." [...] Force India decided not to appeal the decision. Williams's Head of Vehicle Performance Rob Smedley lamented the slow pit stop of his team that preceded the incident, saying that Massa should have exited the pit lane safely ahead of Hülkenberg. While initial reactions in the United Kingdom agreed with the stewards' decision, German tabloid Bild called the penalty a [...] "joke". Hülkenberg later accepted {{that he was at}} fault and apologised to Massa via text message. Concerning the accident between Button and Maldonado, no further action was taken by the stewards. Jenson Button however followed up on his [...] "mental"-remark during the race, by stating that he felt Maldonado's driving was [...] "very strange" [...] and that he [...] "won't ever change". Maldonado answered by saying: [...] "No driver's happy if there's a car {{in front of them and}} they want to get past, especially if it damages their car trying to overtake [...] We both got damage to our cars; he was behind me trying to get past, I was defending my position. That's racing." ...|$|E
