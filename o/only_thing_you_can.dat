Between 2007 and 2010, BP refineries in Ohio and Texas accounted for 97 percent of [...] "egregious, willful" [...] violations handed out by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). BP had 760 [...] "egregious, willful" [...] violations during that period, while Sunoco and Conoco-Phillips each had eight, Citgo two and Exxon had one.

2500|$|In 2006, Havins {{was asked}} if she felt that Babe had been {{redeemed}} since the baby switch. Havins replied, [...] "More or less. That's not {{something that can be}} done overnight; it takes time. And I don't think it's necessarily acts, like one heroic act, that redeem someone." [...] She clarified: It's just showing change. She's very remorseful and there's regret with the whole situation. It's one thing if somebody didn't feel sorry for what they did, but she repented for her sins. Everyone has a past. Everyone makes mistakes. The <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do is move on and try to be a better person from that point forward. When Bianca forgives Babe in 2007 for keeping her child from her, there were viewers who still felt that it was due to Bianca being in love with Babe, and were upset that Bianca could not seem to resist any interaction with her. In a 2007 interview with TV Guide, Havins seemed perplexed that a significant number of viewers had still not forgiven Babe for the baby switch, and felt that the character had been redeeming herself.|$|E

2500|$|Writing in Melody Maker, Michael Watts {{described}} Living in the Material World as [...] "Harrison's personal statement" [...] documenting {{his journey}} towards [...] "a spiritual goal {{which for the}} first time he has been able to define". Watts continued: [...] "now he stands as something more than an entertainer. Now he's being honest. When you've been through all the bullshit and come out the other side, that's the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be." [...] In his review for Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden praised the album's [...] "inspirationally, opulently, romantic" [...] qualities, and he wrote of [...] "That Is All" [...] and [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round" [...] as [...] "two devotional prayers whose solemn mantra-influenced melodies are barely able to sustain their lush orchestration. Yet they do, so that at the end we are left suspended in ethereality..." [...] Holden added that [...] "a close listening from start to finish is roughly equivalent to participating in a mass spectacle of religious re-dedication – one that does not end with rousing anthems but in heavenly choirs." [...] Some reviewers objected to the preponderance of ballads on the album, however, as well as the overt religiosity of many of its songs.|$|E
2500|$|Lopez {{revealed}} to MTV that the album {{would have a}} very tight and focused concept. Although in initial interviews she refused to reveal the title or concept, she said the album was personal to her. [...] "You can't help but put not only your kids into it, but to put anything you are going through in your music", she said. [...] "he <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> really sing or write is stuff that you know. The more music you make and the more that you get into it {{and the more you}} write, the more you realize that's all you can write." [...] In October 2009, People magazine revealed that Lopez's album was going to be called Love?. She would tell KIIS FM's DJ Skee that she had chosen to call her album Love? because love was something that still confused her. [...] "Love is the most confusing thing in the world, that's why the album is called Love with a question mark." [...] Lopez told The Advocates Brandon Voss that she also took into account the gay community and how they might feel towards the album. She said all her previous albums had a universal appeal and the LGBT community had played a part in the success of her music in the past, e.g. [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] (1999).|$|E
2500|$|In 1968 Matson began a decades-long {{separation}} from the Beats. The seeds were evident in a discussion with Ginsberg, when Matson asserted that [...] "Every user is a pusher." [...] Ginsberg countered, [...] "That isn’t literally true," [...] {{at least in the}} eyes of the judicial system. Matson's experience, especially with Huncke and Erin Black, led him to question the Beats’ elitism and their patriarchal, anti-feminist bias. Moving away from the bias that savage aspects are at the apex of our personalities, showed Matson the larger landscape. At Huncke's Memorial in 1996, Matson addressed Huncke's impulse that [...] "the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do with the pain inside is medicate it. That's shitty, Herb." [...] Gregory Corso complained Matson was criticizing Beat behavior, and Matson replied that other options were available. [...] Matson had become by then an avid participant in 12-step programs. Matson's most influential teachers, besides poetry and Huncke, were women. [...] "I am a person!" [...] Erin Black proclaimed in 1964, with proto-feminist exactness. Eila Kokkinen, who was conversant with the Beats, provided a balanced perspective and included psychoanalytic insights. Relationships with Martha Muhs, Maggie Clougherty, and Phyllis Ideal, and the general atmosphere of the 1970s engendered the sense that whatever strategies worked for Matson needed to include women. [...] The strategies needed to work for women, also. Fundamental threads prevail throughout Matson's work: the urge to honesty and to give messages from the body first regard. The stage was set, through training with the Beat Generation, for the development of his writing and of his career. Matson's evolution points directly toward his recent conception of [...] "Paleo Poetry" [...] and the primitive heart.|$|E

2500|$|To {{complement}} the gameplay, distinctive, stylistic visuals were decided upon {{and carried out}} through the CANVAS graphics engine. Adding a touch of fantasy to the mix, the development team hoped {{to be able to}} garner attention from gamers who did not play games with similar settings but more realistic combat. The use of a warm color palette took emphasis away from the [...] "grotesque, realistic nature of war itself," [...] as Nonaka had stated, and focused instead on the characters and story. Tanaka added that, [...] "we wanted to show that realism isn't the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do with 3D graphics." [...] The character designs for the game were created by Raita Honjou, who, {{along with the rest of}} the development staff, aimed for a look that was described by 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish as [...] "rustic." [...] In early stages designs drew more directly on examples from World War II, however they proved to be too modern for what the team wanted to achieve. Thus, Raita aimed for a motif closer to that found in World War I, first creating Alicia and Welkin's concept illustrations and using them as a basis for the rest of the Gallian cast. World War II influence can still be seen in the designs of Imperial characters such as Gregor, whose uniform is heavily based on German officers' uniforms from that period. The end result of these efforts was described by Japanese director Mamoru Oshii as giving him [...] "an impression similar to ... the Nausicaä manga," [...] and Nonaka admits to aiming for the style found in World Masterpiece Theater.|$|E
2500|$|While on set filming for The Back-up Plan in June 2009, Lopez {{revealed}} to MTV's Larry Carol {{that she had}} been working on the follow-up album to 2007's Brave. She had been working on the album during pregnancy, {{but it was not until}} the birth of her twins, Max and Emme, that she was able to focus on the project. Carol asked about the direction of the album, but Lopez refused to comment, instead saying [...] "You can't help but put not only your kids into it, but to put anything you are going through in your music. [...] The <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> really sing or write is stuff that you know. The more music you make and the more that you get into it and the more you write, the more you realize that's all you can write." [...] At the time of the interview, two of the album's songs had leaked. The first, titled [...] "(What Is) Love?", was written by Wynter Gordon and co-written and produced by Emile Dernst II (D'Mile). After expressing dismay at the song's leak, its writer (Wynter Gordon) spoke of why the song was very personal to her: [...] " [...] not knowing what love is ...I felt like so many woman have that same story. No fathers, families, abusive boyfriends and husbands..no parental support, they feel alone [...]. I've had my few relationships and have yet to feel love [...]" [...] Jean Baptist produced a 'part-two' for the song, which was mentioned at one of the album pre-release parties, attended by Rap-Up magazine, however the second part of the song was omitted from the track listing. The original version of the song, under the title [...] "What Is Love", was included on the soundtrack to the 2010 film, The Back-up Plan, starring Lopez.|$|E

[...] "So I'm always glad when it's Sunday night [...] . for more reasons than one. Sunday is a very long day on the shore road. Grandma says it's all too short for her and that father never found Sundays {{tiresome}} {{when he was a little}} boy. It wouldn't seem so long if I could talk to my rock people but I never do that because Grandma doesn't approve of it on Sundays. I think a good deal; but I'm afraid my thoughts are worldly. Grandma says we should never think anything but religious thoughts on Sundays. But teacher here said once that every really beautiful thought was religious, no matter what it was about, or what day we thought it on. But I feel sure Grandma thinks that sermons and Sunday School lessons are the <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> think truly religious thoughts about.

But then, you see, Grandma has brought father up HER way and made a brilliant success of him; and teacher has never brought anybody up yet, though she's helping with Davy and Dora. But you can't tell how they'll turn out till they ARE grown up. So sometimes I feel as if it might be safer to go by Grandma's opinions." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{response}} to observations {{that the novel}} was a more light-hearted affair than his previous books, Le Carré replied that, [...] "I think I'm in the same mood as ever, {{but in some ways}} more mature.

I think my character does both. In some ways it's a very personal book. I was exploring the relationship between myself and my own fabricator. Anybody in the creative business, as you might call it, has some sense of guilt about fooling around with fact, that you're committing larceny, that all of life is material for your fabulations. That was certainly Harry Pendel's position. So I found some kind of buzz running between me and the main character, which I had not really felt since A Perfect Spy." ...|$|R
