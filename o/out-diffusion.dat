Another example is represented by thin TiN films in microelectronic chips separating electrically conducting aluminum lines from the embedding insulator SiO2 in order to suppress the formation of Al2O3.

Modeling calculations have shown that a thin, highly defective layer at this interface, perhaps caused by significant H <b>out-diffusion</b> and incomplete lattice reconstruction, results in sharply lower device FFs due to the large voltage dropped across this defective layer. We have therefore employed buffer layers designed to retard this <b>out-diffusion.</b> We find that an increased H content, either in the n-layer or a thin intrinsic low temperature buffer layer, does not significantly retard this <b>out-diffusion,</b> as observed by SIMS H profiles on devices. However, if this low temperature buffer layer is thick enough, the <b>out-diffusion</b> is minimized, yielding nearly flat H profiles and a much improved device performance.
