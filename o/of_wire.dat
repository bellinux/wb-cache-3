5|$|Giles Darby, David Bermingham, and Gary Mulgrew {{worked for}} Greenwich NatWest. The three British men {{had worked with}} Fastow on a special purpose entity he had started called Swap Sub. When Fastow was being {{investigated}} by the SEC, the three men met with the British Financial Services Authority (FSA) in November 2001 to discuss their interactions with Fastow. In June 2002, the U.S. issued warrants for their arrest on seven counts <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> fraud, and they were then extradited. On July 12, a potential Enron witness scheduled to be extradited to the U.S., Neil Coulbeck, {{was found dead in}} a park in north-east London. Coulbeck's death was eventually ruled to have been a suicide. The U.S. case alleged that Coulbeck and others conspired with Fastow. In a plea bargain in November 2007, the trio plead guilty to one count <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> fraud while the other six counts were dismissed. Darby, Bermingham, and Mulgrew were each sentenced to 37 months in prison. In August 2010, Bermingham and Mulgrew retracted their confessions.|$|E

5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements.

The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose.

5|$|Beaches {{were blocked}} with {{entanglements}} of barbed wire, {{usually in the}} form of three coils of concertina wire fixed by metal posts, or a simple fence of straight wires supported on waist-high posts.

5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E
5|$|When Lincoln {{failed in}} 1989 it cost the federal {{government}} over $3 billion and about 23,000 customers were left with worthless bonds. In the early 1990s, Keating was convicted in both federal and state courts of many counts of fraud, racketeering and conspiracy. He served {{four and a half}} years in prison before those convictions were overturned in 1996. In 1999, he pleaded guilty to a more limited set <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> fraud and bankruptcy fraud counts, and was sentenced to the time he had already served.

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{displays}} are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones. Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of submission. The manus flutter is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter its primary feathers in its wings. A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back and expose its underparts. Birds may fluff up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack. Young birds display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older birds often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or tugging at various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> and handing them to other birds. A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and flying off with it, with other birds pursuing and attempting {{to bring down the}} leader by latching onto its tail feathers. Birds may jump on each other and even engage in mock fighting. Play may even take place with other species such as blue-faced honeyeaters and Australasian pipits.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, UBS {{agreed to}} pay US$160 million in restitution, {{penalties}} and disgorgement of profits for rigging bids in the U.S. municipal bond market, after the bank and three of its employees were charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2010. In July 2013, the three employees were convicted of conspiracy in the muni market fraud: former UBS Vice President Gary Heinz was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined US$400,000; former UBS global commodities chief Peter Ghavami was sentenced to 18 months and fined US $1 million; and former UBS VP Michael Welty received a 16-month sentence and fined US$300,000. In addition to conspiracy, Ghavami and Heinz also were convicted <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> fraud. Federal prosecutors had asked for much harsher sentences, but U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood rebuffed the request. Wood said that the criminal behavior of the three was an aberration from their normal law-abiding lives.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{were kept}} in cramped and squalid {{conditions}} at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages {{was built in the}} 1870s. Further changes took place in the early twentieth century, when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat, with concrete 'rocks', more open space and a moat instead of bars. He designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo, among others, in the early twentieth century. Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos. In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park.|$|E

5|$|Peter Jackson {{was nine}} years old when he first saw the 1933 film, and was in tears in front of the TV when Kong slipped off the Empire State Building. At age 12, he {{attempted}} to recreate the film using his parents' Super 8 mm film camera and a model of Kong made <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> and rubber with his mother's fur coat for the hair, but eventually gave up on the project. King Kong eventually became his favorite film and was the primary inspiration for his decision to become a filmmaker as a teenager. He read books about the making of King Kong and collected memorabilia, as well as articles from Famous Monsters of Filmland. Jackson paid tribute to the 1933 film by including Skull Island as the origin of the zombie plague in his 1992 film Braindead.|$|E

The two sentences did not run concurrently. Rather, Jackson initially served prison time and upon his release, his wife was to begin her prison sentence shortly thereafter. The staggered sentences allowed for the Jackson children {{to have access to}} at least one parent during the time each is in prison.|$|E
