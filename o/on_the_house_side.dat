50|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>side,</b> {{an older}} manned two-track system, {{with a single}} open-topped car {{operating}} on each track, shuttles passengers between the Rayburn House Office Building and the Capitol. On the Senate side, two separate subway systems exist. The first {{is similar to the}} one found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>side.</b> It connects the Russell Senate Office Building and the Capitol. The other is a computer-controlled system with three trains of three cars each that connects the Hart Senate Office Building, Dirksen Senate Office Building, and the Capitol. It is propelled by a track-side linear motor, while the train cars are unpowered. This line is mostly two-tracked but at the Hart and Capitol stations the tracks converge into one, with a single side platform. This allows easy return travel on the opposite track. The Dirksen station features a side platform for Capitol-bound trains and an island platform for Hart-bound trains. All three of these stations feature platform screen doors. A small maintenance spur is located adjacent to the Hart station. The House and Senate subway systems do not terminate in the same location under the Capitol, but they are connected by a labyrinth of tunnels.|$|E
5000|$|A final unbuilt {{recommendation}} of the McMillan Plan was the concept of grouping {{a large number of}} executive branch office buildings around the United States Congress. The concept was two-fold: To complement the existing United States Botanic Garden (built in 1867), Library of Congress Building (built in 1897), Cannon House Office Building (built in 1908), and Russell Senate Office Building (built in 1909) to create a symmetrical look to the Capitol environs; and to reduce the time and trouble it took for executive branch workers to serve the needs of Congress. No executive branch office buildings were ever constructed. A number of buildings were constructed nearby, but they were not in the symmetrical siting or design advocated by the McMillan Plan. These structures included the Longworth House Office Building (finished in 1933), the United States Supreme Court Building (finished in 1935), and the John Adams Library of Congress Building (finished in 1939). The Longworth and Adams buildings were both <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>side,</b> and no attempt was made to purchase the land bounded by Maryland Avenue NE, 1st Street NE, and Constitution Avenue NE. This property was quickly developed with private office buildings without reference to the McMillan Plan. Yet another building, the Rayburn House Office Building, was built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>side</b> in 1965. This left the United States Capitol Complex unbalanced. Only in 1972 was the relatively small Dirksen Senate Office Building completed on the Senate side. Thus far, all the buildings constructed were within the Beaux-Arts or [...] "stripped Neoclassical" [...] style. But in 1976, construction on the James Madison Library of Congress Building was completed in the southeast corner of the Capitol Complex. Not only was this building <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>side</b> (again), but it was Modernist in style and did not fit well architecturally with the other structures. This was followed in 1982 with the Modernist Hart Senate Office Building, whose primary concession to the Beaux-Arts style was a marble exterior.|$|E

The painting was removed or destroyed during {{the early part of}} the renovations in 1990.|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the types and {{characteristics}} of Bale bale, and to identify Bale bale as a common space in a high-density environment on Lae Lae isle, Makassar-Indonesia. With the aid of 62 questionnaires, a field survey of 225 Bale bale was undertaken in November 2009 and September 2010. The following are the main findings of this study: (1) The owner can put their Bale bales anywhere on Lae Lae isle and they can move their Bale bales {{from one place to}} another, including neighbors without permission. (2) Bale bale is classified into five types, namely, siring, terrace, yard, roadside, and seashore. (3) The Bale bale takes either of two forms: prototype and hut shaped. (4) The direction of the Bale bale prototype is either one way, facing the street, inside, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>house???s</b> <b>sides.</b> <b>The</b> direction of the hut-shaped Bale bale is toward <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> toward <b>the</b> street, and toward the sea. (5) The roadside Bale bale is used more often than the other types. Sitting and chatting are the most frequent activities performed by islanders <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Bale bale. Sleeping, eating,, and repairing boat machines are mostly done by Lae Lae islanders on roadside and seashore Bale bales...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the 95th Congress, second session (1978), {{compensation}} amendments were drafted and included in both the Senate and House bills. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>side,</b> amendments were approved by the Public Works Committee and were in the bill reported to the full House. In the Senate, however, the amendments were opposed by Vermont Sen. Robert T. Stafford, who offered a substitute amendment during full committee mark up, which was accepted by the full committee and by the Senate. Under Stafford's amendment, compensation was not guaranteed for any sign which at one time conformed to the 1965 Act. That would have meant no compensation for most signs in commercial or industrial areas.|$|E
