5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>was</b> not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E

25|$|It {{was one of}} {{the poorest}} Test matches in {{technique}} and spirit that I have witnessed. It lacked virility from birth. The Australians came to it with no great spirit of adventure or relish after the Ashes had been won. The policy was, after winning the toss, to hold tight and let the pitch and the Englishmen go to pieces. What went to pieces, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>was</b> the game itself.|$|E

25|$|Caroline and George {{were married}} on 8 April 1795 at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace, in London. At the ceremony, George was drunk. He {{regarded}} Caroline as unattractive and unhygienic, and told Malmesbury that {{he suspected that}} she was not a virgin when they married. He, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>was</b> not. He had himself already secretly married Maria Fitzherbert; however, his marriage to Fitzherbert violated the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and thus was not legally valid.|$|E
25|$|The {{magistrate}} was {{supervised by}} the prefect (zhifu) or the equivalent, {{who in turn}} was ordinarily under the circuit intendant (dao), or perhaps a circuit intendant with such special responsibilities as waterworks, grain, or salt. Above them were the provincial administrators and the governor. Above all of these, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>was</b> the central government and the emperor. Each of these layers could issue orders to the local magistrate and each required reports and memorials from him.|$|E
25|$|Ambient air, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>was</b> the {{original}} machining coolant. Compressed air, supplied through {{pipes and hoses}} from an air compressor and discharged from a nozzle aimed at the tool, is sometimes a useful coolant. The force of the decompressing air stream blows chips away, and the decompression itself has a slight degree of cooling action. The net {{result is that the}} heat of the machining cut is carried away a bit better than by ambient air alone. Sometimes liquids are added to the air stream to form a mist (mist coolant systems, described above).|$|E

25|$|However {{an equally}} {{great number of}} people in Rotorua {{supported}} the railway proposal and consequently it became a hot political debate. By 1973 NZR started to back down on the proposal and stated that the scheme would only proceed if the people of Rotorua agreed upon where the marshaling yards would be located. This <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>was</b> never likely to occur and consequently the scheme fell though shortly after. This was the last time serious consideration was given for a railway to Taupo from Rotorua.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the anomaly is disputed. A widely {{accepted}} view, but not the official view, states that the road was set out by two surveyors, one moving north and the other moving south, each of whom set out {{the road to the}} right of their survey line. Another widely held belief is that the change <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>was</b> designed to protect a large tree which formerly stood at the site where the kink is. However, why during the development of a milling area a single tree would be protected, and why the road would not return to its original line after passing the tree are both unexplained by this theory.|$|E
25|$|Chinese forces used rapid {{attacks on}} the flanks and rear and {{infiltration}} behind UN lines to {{give the appearance of}} vast hordes. This, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>was</b> augmented by the Chinese tactic of maximizing their forces for the attack, ensuring a large local numerical superiority over their opponent. The initial Chinese victory along the Yalu River was a great morale booster for the PVA and the first Chinese victory over the West in modern times. However, by late 1951, overextended supply lines and superior UN firepower had forced a stalemate. The North Koreans that invaded in 1950 had been much better supplied and armed by the Soviets than the Chinese Army had been. The main arms of the PVA were captured Japanese and KMT arms.|$|E

25|$|After the First World War, {{the number}} of Indian cavalry regiments was reduced from thirty-nine to twenty-one. However, instead of {{disbanding}} the surplus units, {{it was decided to}} amalgamate them in pairs. This resulted in renumbering and renaming of the entire cavalry line. In September 1923, the 31st Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers were amalgamated with the 32nd Lancers to form 13th Duke of Connaught’s Own Bombay Lancers. This particular merger, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>was</b> simply a reunion of two regiments separated {{more than a hundred years}} before. The new badge was to be crossed lances with '13' on the intersection; a crown above and a scroll below, reading 'Duke of Connaught's Own.' Their uniform was blue with scarlet facings, and the new class composition was one squadron each of Pathans, Muslim Rajputs and Sikhs. In 1927, the regiment was redesignated as the 13th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers.|$|E
25|$|James Hildreth {{scored a}} quick 46 off 26 {{deliveries}} at Sophia Gardens as Somerset Sabres set a challenging target of 183 to Glamorgan Dragons. No Glamorgan bowler really had {{control over the}} Somerset batsmen, and yet they lost their wickets. A highlight of the innings was the effort of Somerset's No. 9 Gareth Andrew, who smashed three fours in his first three balls and then was bowled with the fourth. In reply, Glamorgan got to 126 for 2 before part-timers Keith Parsons and Hildreth {{got the better of}} them and took wickets at a leisure - however, Alex Wharf hung in there with Michael Powell and carried the Dragons to 183 for 8 after the 20 overs were up. The crowd seemed content with the one point and a tie, but the speaker informed the crowd of the actual result, which <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>was</b> pleasing to the home side.|$|E
25|$|Duchamp {{submitted}} {{the work to}} appear with the Cubists at the 28th exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants, Paris, 25 March through 16 May 1912. It appeared under the number 1001 of the catalogue, entitled simply Nu descendant l'escalier, not Nu descendant un escalier n° 2. This catalogue revealed {{the title of the}} painting to the general public for the first time, even though the painting itself would be absent from the exhibition. It has been noted disquisitively that the number 1001 of Duchamp's entry at the 1912 Indépendants catalogue also happens to represent in the form 10.01 the integer 2 in the Golden ratio base, related to the golden section, something of much interest to the Duchamps and others of the Puteaux Group. This, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>was</b> by chance—and it is not known whether Duchamp was familiar enough with the mathematics of the golden ratio to have made such a connection—as it was by chance too the relation to Arabic Manuscript of One Thousand and One Nights dating back to the 14th century.|$|E

25|$|All {{the while}} the Delaware General Assembly was {{attempting}} to elect a U.S. Senator. Since the two houses voted together, the more numerous Republicans held an overall majority and attempted to elect Henry A. du Pont to the office. But the Republicans were divided and enough supported the candidacy of Addicks to barely prevent a majority from electing du Pont. Then, with accession of Watson to the Governor's office, {{the total number of}} members seemed to be reduced and du Pont had a majority. The Delaware General Assembly went to vote only to find Watson had returned to his old State Senate seat, casting his vote for the Democratic candidate, but more importantly preventing du Pont from receiving a majority. This was an unprecedented action by an Acting Governor, but the Delaware Constitution of 1831, then in effect, did not address the question. The Republican Speaker of the State House disallowed the vote and certified the election of du Pont, but the Democratic controlled U.S. Senate rejected his credentials, thereby preserving its own majority. This, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>was</b> the real purpose behind Watson's action. The soon to be drafted, Delaware Constitution of 1897, resolved the issue for good by creating the independent office of Lieutenant Governor.|$|E

500|$|The {{songs for}} Frozen were written and {{composed}} by the husband-and-wife songwriting team of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, {{both of whom}} had previously worked with Disney Animation on Winnie the Pooh (2011) (also produced by Del Vecho, who then hired them for Frozen) and before that, with Disney Parks on Finding Nemo– The Musical (2007). Lopez first heard Disney Animation's pitch while in Los Angeles working on The Book of Mormon, but Disney was so eager to get both of them on board that the production team traveled to New York City to also pitch the film in person to Anderson-Lopez (who was busy raising the couple's two young daughters). Lopez believes Disney was particularly interested in his wife's strong story talent. The decision, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>was</b> easy: [...] "Whenever Disney asks {{if you want to}} do a fairy tale musical, you say yes." ...|$|E
