25|$|An {{expression}} of intent inter presents becomes effective {{at the moment}} when the person to whom it is made understands it well. An {{expression of}} intent inter absents becomes effective {{at the moment when}} the notification of the expression reaches such other party, except when the withdrawal of the notification previously or simultaneously reaches such other party. The fact that after the notification of the expression the expresser dies, or becomes unable to make juridical acts, or is limited in capacity to make juridical acts, shall not null the expression of intent. In the interpretation of an expression of intent, the real intention of the parties must be sought rather than the literal meaning of the words. A person who offers to make a contract shall be bound by his offer except at the time of offer he has excluded this <b>obligation</b> <b>or</b> except it may be presumed from the circumstances or from the nature of the affair that he did not intend to be bound. Exposing goods for sale with their selling price shall be deemed to be an offer. However, the sending of pricelists is not deemed to be an offer. An offer ceases to be binding if it is refused. An offer made inter presentes ceases to be binding if it is not accepted at once.An acceptance which arrives late, except under the circumstances in the preceding article, shall be deemed to be a new offer.|$|E

Smart (1973), Moral Luck (1981) and Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy (1985), outlined his {{attacks on the}} twin pillars of ethics: utilitarianism and the moral philosophy of the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Martha Nussbaum wrote that his work [...] "denounced the trivial and evasive way in which moral philosophy was being practised in England {{under the aegis of}} those two dominant theories." [...] "Both theories simplified the moral life," [...] she wrote, [...] "neglecting emotions and personal attachments and how sheer luck shapes our choices."

2500|$|A collateralized {{mortgage}} <b>obligation,</b> <b>or</b> [...] "pay-through bond", is a debt {{obligation of}} a legal entity that is collateralized by the assets it owns. Pay-through bonds are typically divided into classes that have different maturities and different priorities for the receipt of principal {{and in some cases}} of interest. They often contain a sequential pay security structure, with at least two classes of mortgage-backed securities issued, with one class receiving scheduled principal payments and prepayments before any other class. Pay-through securities are classified as debt for income tax purposes.|$|E

2500|$|Emotional blackmailers use fear, {{obligation}} and guilt in their relationships, ensuring that others feel afraid to cross them, obligated {{to give them}} their way and swamped by guilt if they resist. Knowing that someone close to them wants love, approval or confirmation of identity and self-esteem, blackmailers may threaten to withhold them or take them away altogether, making the person feel they must earn them by agreement. Fear, <b>obligation</b> <b>or</b> guilt is {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "FOG". FOG is a contrived acronym—a play on the word fog which describes something that obscures and confuses a situation or someone's thought processes.|$|E
2500|$|A {{factitious}} disorder {{is a condition}} in which a person, without a malingering motive, acts as if they have an illness by deliberately producing, feigning, or exaggerating symptoms, purely to attain a patient's role. [...] Factitious disorder imposed on another ("{{factitious disorder}} by proxy", also called Munchausen's syndrome by proxy) is {{a condition in which}} a person deliberately produces, feigns, or exaggerates the symptoms of someone in their care. [...] In either case, the perpetrator's motive is to attain (for themselves or for another) a patient's role. [...] Factitious disorder differs fundamentally from malingering in that the malingerer simulates illness with a view to obtaining a material benefit or avoiding an <b>obligation</b> <b>or</b> responsibility.|$|E
2500|$|William Godwin, in {{founding}} philosophical anarchism, developed {{what many}} consider the first expression of modern anarchist thought. Godwin was, according to Peter Kropotkin, [...] "the first to formulate {{the political and}} economical conceptions of anarchism, {{even though he did}} not give that name to the ideas developed in his work." [...] Philosophical anarchism contends that the state lacks moral legitimacy; that there is no individual <b>obligation</b> <b>or</b> duty to obey the State, and conversely, that the State has no right to command individuals, but it does not advocate revolution to eliminate the state. According to The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought, philosophical anarchism [...] "is a component especially of individualist anarchism." ...|$|E

[...] The surviving brother is given a choice to take his responsibility as a goel by fulfilling the yibbum <b>obligation,</b> <b>or</b> to perform halizah, though the latter choice is described by the verse disfavorably. The brother who agreed to marry his sister-in-law would be the sole benefactor of his brother's estate instead of splitting it with the family. The offspring of the levirate union would be seen as a perpetuation of the deceased brother's name. Levirate marriage is permissible only when the dead brother had no children at all.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Reapers' are beings tasked by the Devil to {{apprehend}} souls that have escaped {{the depths of}} Hell. Sam became one in the premiere episode of the series.

Currently, it is not exactly known how many Reapers there are, or if all of them are even human. Sam does not like this status but begins to live with this fate, though shows no surprise towards its utterance. It is made clear by the demon Steve that Sam is perhaps the only person on Earth that the Devil talks with face-to-face, which raises suspicion amongst Sam and his friends. This suggestion is later disproved when the Devil introduces Morgan, a young man the Devil claims is his son.|$|E
2500|$|Whenever {{there is}} a {{possibility}} that the pressure exposure of a dive may incur a decompression obligation on the diver it is necessary for safety to monitor the depth and duration of the dive to ensure that either there is no decompression <b>obligation,</b> <b>or</b> that the appropriate decompression procedures are followed for a safe ascent. This process may be automated by using a personal dive computer, in which case the diver is [...] required to understand how to read the output and follow the decompression instructions displayed. The display and operation of dive computers is not standardized, and the user is expected to learn the correct operation of the specific model of computer to be used before diving with it. Accurate monitoring of depth and time is particularly important when diving using a schedule requiring decompression according to decompression tables.|$|E
