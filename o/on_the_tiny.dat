25|$|The citrus {{mealybug}} looks {{very similar to}} the vine mealybug (Planococcus ficus), and the two species are mainly distinguished by the arrangement of pores and tubular ducts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> body of the female. This similarity can pose a problem in agriculture. For example, when growers are ready to attempt biological pest control of either mealybug, the use of molecular analysis is recommended to confirm the identity of the species so an appropriate parasitoid can be employed.|$|E

25|$|The citadel of Atlit {{having been}} {{dismantled}} by the Mamluks in 1291, Tortosa remained {{the most likely}} stronghold on the mainland which {{had the potential to}} be recaptured. From Cyprus, King Henry and members of the three military orders (Knights Templar, Knights Hospitaller and Teutonic Knights), attempted to retake Tortosa in 1300.

The Lower Moselle landscape {{differs from that of}} the Middle and Upper Moselle, much of it forming a narrower valley with high and steep sides in places. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> cut banks of the river that are oriented towards the south and west, vineyards are managed, often <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiniest,</b> terraced strips of land on steep hillslopes.|$|R

From June through August, tons of bombs were dropped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> island, though the Japanese ultimately escaped via transport ships.

25|$|The SDFT is {{narrower}} in {{its middle}} third than its top or bottom sections, making it weaker. The {{top and bottom}} of the SDFT has a better supply of blood as well, with the top third supplied by the vessels from the knee, and the bottom third supplied by the vessels in the fetlock. The middle third has a poor supply of blood, relying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> vessels of the peritendon (the membrane that surrounds the tendons). If this supply is for some reason compromised, the collagen fibers in the area may die, weakening the tendon in that area and making it more likely to tear.|$|E
25|$|Naples is {{well known}} for its {{historic}} castles: the ancient Castel Nuovo, also known as Maschio Angioino, is one of the city's foremost landmarks; it was built during the time of Charles I, the first king of Naples. Castel Nuovo has seen many notable historical events: for example, in 1294, Pope Celestine V resigned as pope in a hall of the castle, and following this Pope Boniface VIII was elected pope by the cardinal collegium, before moving to Rome. The castle which Nuovo replaced in importance was the Norman-founded Castel dell'Ovo ("Egg Castle"), which was built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> islet of Megarides, where the original Cumaean colonists had founded the city.|$|E

25|$|It {{soon became}} {{apparent}} why the Virginia Indians did not occupy the site: Jamestown Island, then a peninsula, is a swampy area, and its {{isolation from the}} mainland meant that there was limited hunting available, as most game animals required larger foraging areas. The settlers quickly hunted and killed off all the large and smaller game animals that were found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> peninsula. In addition, the low, marshy area was infested with airborne pests, including mosquitoes, which carried malaria, and the brackish water of the tidal James River {{was not a good}} source of water. Over 135 settlers died from malaria, and drinking the salinated and contaminated water caused many to suffer from saltwater poisoning, fevers, and dysentery.|$|E
25|$|In July 1938 {{the shadow}} mask color {{television}} was patented by Werner Flechsig (1900–1981) in Germany, and was demonstrated at the International radio exhibition Berlin in 1939. Most CRT color televisions used today {{are based on}} this technology. His {{solution to the problem}} of focusing the electron guns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> colored dots was one of brute-force; a metal sheet with holes punched in it allowed the beams to reach the screen only when they were properly aligned over the dots. Three separate guns were aimed at the holes from slightly different angles, and when their beams passed through the holes the angles caused them to separate again and hit the individual spots a short distance away on the back of the screen. The downside to this approach was that the mask cut off the vast majority of the beam energy, allowing it to hit the screen only 15% of the time, requiring a massive increase in beam power to produce acceptable image brightness.|$|E
25|$|In 1810, Magicienne {{remained}} off the islands, {{participating in}} the Invasion of Île Bonaparte in July and subsequently supporting Captain Samuel Pym off Grand Port. Pym was intending to blockade the harbour to French shipping, but when a squadron under Guy-Victor Duperré arrived off the port on 20 August, Pym sought to lure them into coastal waters and engage them. Duperré successfully broke through Pym's ships however, and took shelter within the harbour. Pym gathered his frigates together and sailed directly into the harbour on 22 August to engage the French. Lacking harbour pilots, Pym's HMS Sirius, Henry Lambert's HMS Iphigenia and Magicienne were soon aground on the coral reefs that sheltered the bay, and the remaining British ship, Nesbit Willoughby's HMS Nereide, was forced to surrender by the French frigates in the port. Of the grounded ships, only Iphigenia sailed again, captured by Hamelin five days later. Sirius and Magicienne were burnt, their crews taking shelter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> Île de la Passe. Without food or fresh water, the sailors were forced to surrender to Hamelin when he arrived and were held prisoner until Isle de France was captured by a British expeditionary force four months later.|$|E

On the morning of 19 January, Hiyoshi Maru entered York Sound on the mainland. Although the crew saw smoke emanating from hills {{to the east of}} their location, they nevertheless anchored and camouflaged the vessel with tree branches. Local historians state that Matsu Kikan landing parties went ashore near the mouth of the Roe River (...) [...] They reportedly explored onshore for about two hours, and some members of the mission filmed the area using an 8 mm camera. The Matsu Kikan personnel spent the night on the boat and reconnoitred the area again the following day, before returning to Kupang. The Japanese did not sight any people or signs of recent human activity and little of military significance was learnt from the mission.|$|E
500|$|Marlborough {{returned}} to campaigning in the Low Countries in June 1709. After outwitting Marshal Villars {{to take the}} town of Tournai on 3 September (a major and bloody operation), the Allies turned their attention upon Mons, determined to maintain the ceaseless pressure on the French. With direct orders from the increasingly desperate LouisXIV to save the city, Villars advanced <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> village of Malplaquet on 9 September 1709 and entrenched his position. Two days later the opposing forces clashed in battle. On the Allied left flank the Prince of Orange led his Dutch infantry in desperate charges only to have it cut to pieces. On the other flank, Eugene attacked and suffered almost as severely. Nevertheless, sustained pressure on his extremities forced Villars to weaken his centre, enabling Marlborough to break through and claim victory. Yet the cost was high: the allied casualty figures were approximately double that of the enemy (sources vary), leading Marlborough to admit – [...] "The French have defended themselves better in this action than in any battle I've seen". The Duke proceeded to take Mons on 20 October, but on his return to England his enemies used the Malplaquet casualty figures to sully his reputation. Harley, now master of the Tory party, did all he could to persuade his colleagues that the pro-war Whigs – and by their apparent concord with Whig policy, Marlborough and Godolphin – were bent on leading the country to ruin.|$|E
