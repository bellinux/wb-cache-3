5|$|As soon as {{he could}} walk, Braille spent time playing in his father's workshop. At the age of three, the child was playing with some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools,</b> trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E

These tools, in either straight or ball end configuration, can produce intricate shapes in very hard steel (H> 55 Rc), quickly and without grinding.

Having access only to soft limestone, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> fashioned by Native Americans in the region were made of shell, bone, wood, and animal teeth; shark teeth were used as cutting blades, and sharpened reeds became arrows and spears. Shell mounds still exist today within the park, giving archaeologists and anthropologists evidence of the raw materials available to the indigenous people for tool construction. Spanish explorers estimated the number of Tequesta at first contact to be around 800, and Calusa at 2,000; the National Park Service reports there were probably about 20,000 natives living {{in or near the}} Everglades when the Spanish established contact in the late 16th century. The Calusa society was more advanced, as they lived in social strata, and were able to create canals, earthworks, and shellworks. The Calusa were also able to resist Spanish attempts at conquest.|$|E

Another part of the customary byplay between Q and Bond is Bond's amused reaction to the latest devices and the Quartermaster's indignant response ("I never joke about my work").

Therefore, under <b>the</b> condition <b>of</b> interrupted machining, <b>the</b> uneven distribution state of cutting force and cutting temperature results in adhesive wear even <b>the</b> fracture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> Higher cutting speed helps to decreases cutting force and is recommended to use in high speed milling of stainless steel.|$|R
