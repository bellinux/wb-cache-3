5|$|Reviews of {{the game}} were {{generally}} positive. Critics focused primarily on the visuals, music and atmosphere as particularly praiseworthy.

30|$|Psychology has {{introduced}} a distinction between “objective” and “subjective” career success. Hughes (1937) defined objective career success as directly observable, measurable, and verifiable by an impartial third party. Examples of such measures <b>of</b> <b>objective</b> career success are money and income, status and position, {{as well as}} the number of promotions. Psychology is interested in objective career success measures insofar as research wants to find out psychological determinants <b>of</b> <b>objective</b> career success as well as consequences <b>of</b> <b>objective</b> success for both the individual's well-being and his/her further career advancement.|$|R
5|$|Design {{managers}} often {{operate in}} the area of design leadership; however, design management and design leadership are interdependent rather than interchangeable. Like management and leadership, they differ in their objectives, achievements <b>of</b> <b>objectives,</b> accomplishments, and outcomes. Design leadership leads from creation of a vision to changes, innovations, and implementation of creative solutions. It stimulates communication and collaboration through motivation, sets ambitions, and points out future directions to achieve long-term objectives. In contrast, design management is reactive and responds to a given business situation by using specific skills, tools, methods, and techniques. Design management requires design leadership to know where to go and design leadership requires design management to know how to get there.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye 007 is a first-person shooter that {{features}} both single and multiplayer modes. In the single-player mode, the player takes {{the role of}} James Bond {{through a series of}} free-roaming 3D levels. Each level requires the player to complete a certain set <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> – such as collecting or destroying specified items, rescuing hostages, or meeting with friendly non-player characters (NPCs) – and then exit the stage. Some gadgets from the James Bond film series are featured in the game and are often used to complete particular mission objectives; for example, in one level the electromagnetic watch from Live and Let Die is used to acquire a jail cell key.|$|E
5|$|In third-person {{missions}} and occasionally some other types, a PDA is available.

Characters also typically have cell phones which they sometimes receive calls on during missions. Some missions involve sniping using first-person shooter gameplay. These missions resemble the use of a sniper rifle during normal missions but the player cannot switch to a third-person view.|$|E

5|$|The Jedi Knight {{series is}} {{composed}} primarily of first/third-person shooter gameplay elements, {{with a number}} of variation on the norms of the genre within each game. All of the games use a level based system which contains a series <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> that must be completed before the player can continue. From Dark Forces II onwards, the games have included lightsaber combat and the use of Force powers, which have been tweaked and modified as the series has progressed.|$|E
5|$|The game's story follows {{bounty hunter}} Samus Aran, who is {{sent by the}} Galactic Federation to {{investigate}} the Biologic Space Laboratories space station, where it is swarming with organisms infected with virions known as the X Parasites. Like in previous Metroid games, Fusion is played from the side-scrolling perspective. It introduces mission-based gameplay that aids the player to explore areas. The game consists <b>of</b> <b>objectives,</b> which are flexible in {{how they can be}} accomplished. Fusion was released simultaneously with the GameCube game Metroid Prime in North America. The bonus features in Prime can be unlocked by linking between the game and Fusion via the Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable.|$|E

5|$|Unlike some MMORPGs, {{there is}} very little focus on player versus player (PvP) combat, instead the game {{revolves}} around player versus environment (PvE). There are numerous PvE activities and events for players to partake in, including instanced activities and shared spaces activities. Some instanced events include Dynamis, Salvage, Assault and Nyzul Isle, which involve anywhere between 6 and 64 players. These battle grounds give players a series <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> to overcome or complete and enemies to defeat, generally within a certain time frame. Popular shared spaces activities include hunting Notorious Monsters, fiends that rarely appear and drop precious loot.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} battles {{followed}} at Uijeongbu on 1–4 January 1951, as the British and Australians occupied defensive positions {{in an attempt}} to secure the northern approaches to the South Korean capital. Further fighting occurred at Chuam-ni on 14–17 February 1951 following another Chinese advance, and later at Maehwa-San between 7–12 March 1951 as the UN resumed the offensive. Australian troops subsequently participated in two more major battles in 1951, with the first taking place during fighting which later became known as the Battle of Kapyong. On 22 April, Chinese forces attacked the Kapyong valley and forced the South Korean defenders to withdraw. Australian and Canadian troops were ordered to halt this Chinese advance. After a night of fighting the Australians recaptured their positions, at the cost of 32 men killed and 59 wounded. In July 1951, the Australian battalion became part of the combined Canadian, British, Australian, New Zealand, and Indian 1st Commonwealth Division. The second major battle took place during Operation Commando and occurred after the Chinese attacked a salient in a bend of the Imjin River. The 1st Commonwealth Division counter-attacked on 3 October, capturing a number <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> including Hill 355 and Hill 317 during the Battle of Maryang San; after five days the Chinese retreated. Australian casualties included 20 dead and 104 wounded.|$|E
5|$|In each level, {{the player}} must {{complete}} certain objectives and then exit the stage. The requirements are varied, with many levels requiring the recovery {{and use of}} numerous high-tech gadgets. If Joanna is killed or fails an objective, the player must start the level again. Three distinct difficulty settings are available for each level, the choice of which will affect aspects such as the number <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> that must be completed, enemy accuracy and damage, {{the effectiveness of the}} game's optional aiming assistance, and the availability of ammunition and protective shields. If all the levels are completed on the highest difficulty, an additional setting becomes available, allowing players to customise various aspects of enemies, such as their health, their aiming accuracy and the damage they inflict. In addition to the main campaign, there are four bonus missions, with three enabling the player to control other characters with unique special abilities. Players can also unlock cheats by completing the levels within certain time limits.|$|E

The board, created in March 1900, {{was designed to}} unify {{the work of the}} Office of Naval Intelligence, the Naval War College, and the fleet leadership for the production of war plans and the proper preparation, planning, and deployment of naval resources in pursuit <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> defined in those plans. After the war, Long pushed forward plans to establish a naval base in the Philippines, however, the funding for plans was held up in Congress, which repeatedly sought review of potential base locations in the islands. The matter was also caught up in branch rivalry with the War Department, which objected to the Navy's establishment of a permanent base there that was not under its authority. Construction of the Subic Bay Naval Base did not begin until after Long left office.|$|E
5|$|In the game's single-player mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} {{a series of}} levels where different types of AI-controlled enemies will try to hinder the player's progress. The game primarily takes place inside labyrinthine underground facilities, but the player can occasionally travel {{over the surface of}} the planets where the facilities are buried to reach other nearby areas. The underground facilities are composed of a set of tunnels and rooms separated by doors. Most of them can be opened by either firing weapons at them or bumping into them, but others require special actions to be performed first before entry is allowed. For instance, some doors require special keys to open them. To finish a level and proceed to the next one, the player must complete a certain set <b>of</b> <b>objectives,</b> ranging from collecting items to activating switches, defeating enemies, and destroying objects, among others. Some levels also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score.|$|E
5|$|Like the series, {{the game}} takes place over 24 hours {{and has the}} same start and end clocks for each hour, marking the start and end of {{each part of the}} game. The hours are broken down into 58 {{separate}} missions, of which there are three broad types, each described in further detail below. Some missions are objective based, while others have a time-restricted element. Each mission is graded out of 100 points, based on the quality of performance, number <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> completed, shooting accuracy and so on. A grade of 90 points or higher rewards the player by unlocking some form of bonus feature, including three movies (interviews with cast about the game, TV promos), 98 images (wallpaper-like images of main characters) and 23 characters (3D models that the player can view).|$|E

5|$|The World Is Not Enough is a first-person shooter {{based on}} MGM's 1999 James Bond {{film of the}} same name, where the player assumes the role of James Bond through 14 {{missions}} with three difficulty settings. The player {{has the ability to}} run, jump, crouch, swim and dive underwater {{for a short period of}} time. One mission is played as a rail shooter in which the player skis down a mountain. In each mission, the player must complete a number <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> while defeating enemies controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Objectives range from rescuing hostages to destroying vehicles and collecting items. Some objectives require the player to use numerous high-tech gadgets. For example, the Keypad Decrypter can be used to decode lock systems, while the ID scanner is useful to copy fingerprints.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{campaign}} received mixed impressions from reviewers. USgamer editor Jaz Rignall {{thought it}} was great for teaching the mechanics of the game and the progression of difficulty was reasonable. GameSpot reviewer Kallie Plagge thought the highest points of the campaign missions were the sequences that borrowed elements from the main Halo games. Brown stated that while the campaign was brief, he felt it had good pacing and there was a decent variety <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> and scenarios. Stapleton agreed that the campaign missions offered enough variety to prevent them from becoming repetitive. However, overall he was unimpressed by the campaign missions, which he perceived as unambitious in their design. He was also surprised by the frequent bugs, which included crashing and mission events failing to trigger, that he experienced during his playthrough of the campaign on the Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|The paratroopers and glider-borne {{airborne}} {{troops of the}} division, commanded by Major-General Richard Nelson Gale, landed on the eastern flank of the invasion area, near {{to the city of}} Caen, tasked with a number <b>of</b> <b>objectives.</b> The division was to capture two strategically important bridges over the Caen Canal and Orne River which were to be used by Allied ground forces to advance once the seaborne landings had taken place, destroy several other bridges to deny their use to the Germans and secure several important villages. The division was also assigned the task of assaulting and destroying the Merville Gun Battery, an artillery battery that Allied intelligence believed housed a number of heavy artillery pieces, which could bombard the nearest invasion beach (codenamed Sword) and possibly inflict heavy casualties on the Allied troops landing on it. Having achieved these objectives, the division was then to create and secure a bridgehead focused around the captured bridges until they linked up with advancing Allied ground forces.|$|E
