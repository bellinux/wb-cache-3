The Ministry of Interior announced that Rajab would be referred to the Military Prosecutor for legal action. The photos showed slash marks all over Saqer's back and other signs of physical abuse, and were also stated to be accurate by an HRW researcher who had seen the body prior to burial. Five prison guards were subsequently charged with Saqer's death.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid {{was present}} at the {{exhumation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> Queen Æthelthryth at Ely Abbey in 695. He had been her spiritual adviser in the 670s, and had helped the queen become a nun against the wishes of her husband King Ecgfrith of Northumbria. The queen had joined Ely Abbey, where she died in 679. The ceremony in 695 found that her body had not decayed, which led to her being declared a saint. Wilfrid's testimony as to the character and virginity of Æthelthryth was recorded by Bede.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{was still}} {{divided by the}} {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War. Menem proposed an agenda of national reconciliation.

Menem intended to use the reconciliation of these historical Argentine figures {{as a metaphor for the}} reconciliation of the Dirty War. However, although the repatriation and acceptance of Rosas was a success, the acceptance of the military regime was not.|$|E

500|$|Some {{theological}} disputes arose. <b>The</b> non-decay <b>of</b> vampires' <b>bodies</b> {{could recall}} <b>the</b> incorruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saints <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church. A paragraph on vampires {{was included in}} the second edition (1749) of De servorum Dei beatificatione et sanctorum canonizatione, On <b>the</b> beatification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> servants <b>of</b> God and on canonization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blessed, written by Prospero Lambertini (Pope Benedict XIV). In his opinion, while <b>the</b> incorruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> saints was <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> a divine intervention, all the phenomena attributed to vampires were purely natural or <b>the</b> fruit <b>of</b> [...] "imagination, terror and fear". In other words, vampires did not exist.|$|R
5|$|Delta Serpentis, forming part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> {{the snake}} between {{the heart and}} the head, is a {{multiple}} star system positioned around 70 parsecs from Earth. Consisting of four stars, the system has a total apparent magnitude of 3.79 as viewed from Earth, although two of the stars, with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.80, provide nearly all the light. The primary, a white subgiant, is a Delta Scuti variable with an average apparent magnitude of 4.23. Positioned very near Delta, both in the night sky and likely in actual space at an estimated distance of around 70 parsecs, is the barium star 16 Serpentis. Another notable variable star {{visible to the naked eye}} is Chi Serpentis, an Alpha² Canum Venaticorum variable situated midway between Delta and Beta which varies from its median brightness of 5.33 by 0.03 magnitudes over a period of approximately 1.5 days.|$|E
5|$|Devotions to Mary {{are part}} of Catholic piety but are {{distinct}} from the worship of God. Practices include prayers and Marian art, music, and architecture. Several liturgical Marian feasts are celebrated throughout the Church Year and she is honoured with many titles such as Queen of Heaven. Pope Paul VI called her Mother of the Church because, by giving birth to Christ, she {{is considered to be}} the spiritual mother to each member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Body</b> <b>of</b> Christ. Because of her influential role in the life of Jesus, prayers and devotions such as the Hail Mary, the Rosary, the Salve Regina and the Memorare are common Catholic practices. Pilgrimages to the sites of several Marian apparitions affirmed by the Church, such as Lourdes, Fátima, and Guadalupe, are also popular Catholic devotions.|$|E
5|$|The first {{axillary}} sclerite (lAx) is {{the anterior}} hinge plate {{of the wing}} base. Its anterior part is supported on the anterior notal wing process of the tergum (ANP); its posterior part articulates with the tergal margin. The anterior end of the sclerite is generally produced as a slender arm, the apex of which (e) is always associated with {{the base of the}} subcostal vein (Sc), though it is not united with the latter. The body of the sclerite articulates laterally with the second axillary. The second axillary sclerite (2Ax) is more variable in form than the first axillary, but its mechanical relations are no less definite. It is obliquely hinged to the outer margin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the first axillary, and the radial vein (R) is always flexibly attached to its anterior end (d). The second axillary presents both a dorsal and a ventral sclerotization in the wing base; its ventral surface rests upon the fulcral wing process of the pleuron. The second axillary, therefore, is the pivotal sclerite of the wing base, and it specifically manipulates the radial vein.|$|E

5|$|Within the Indian Ocean {{north of}} the equator, {{tropical}} cyclones are tracked by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the officially designated Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the region. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also tracks storms in the basin on an unofficial basis. The Arabian Sea, which borders the Arabian Peninsula, typically spawns tropical cyclones in the southeastern portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> water, offshore of western India. About 48.5% of cyclones dissipate without making landfall, or moving ashore, and around one in three storms move toward the Arabian Peninsula. However, storms do not form in the western Arabian Sea because of cool sea surface temperatures (the result of strong winds from the monsoon), as well as dry air from the Arabian Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The {{last chapter}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the book – if Chapter 10 is {{considered}} {{more or less}} an epilogue – covers towns {{seen as part of}} the English landscape. Hoskins justifies this on the grounds that understanding towns brings pleasure. He describes in turn planned towns, the open-field town, and the market town. Towns were planned as early as Norman times, Abbot Baldwin planning Bury St Edmunds between 1066 and 1086; Stratford-on-Avon was laid out in 1196. Another burst of town planning came with the spa towns in the late 18th century, and of new industrial towns like Middlesbrough and Barrow-in-Furness in the mid 19th century. Open-field towns like Nottingham, Leicester, and Stamford grew naturally in their own open fields, but were trapped by pasture rights from growing in the 19th century, giving Nottingham slums, and Leicester a problem that it just managed to solve, growing across its fields: while Stamford stopped growing entirely, becoming fossilised as what Hoskins calls a museum piece of a beautiful 17th and 18th century town. Finally, the market towns like Marlborough grew up around their often large and handsome market places, which are however of any number of shapes.|$|E
