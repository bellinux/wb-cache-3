5|$|Symeon {{taught that}} putting oneself under the {{guidance}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spiritual</b> father was essential {{for those who were}} serious about living the spiritual life. That relationship was a historical tradition especially prominent among the Desert Fathers, who defined the qualifications for acting in the role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spiritual</b> father: personal experience; an interior life; purity of heart; the vision of God; insight; inspiration; discernment. Official ordination as a priest was not a requirement—Symeon's own spiritual father was a simple unordained monk who had many spiritual children. Symeon also taught that such teachers were empowered by their holiness to preach and to absolve others of their sins, a view that brought him into disagreement with church leaders of his time.|$|E
5|$|Antoinism {{believes}} in a dualistic universe composed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spiritual</b> world {{governed by the}} law of God or consciousness, and of a corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence. The man combines in himself both worlds, as he has a physical body and a divine consciousness. In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and science is weakened as they are based not on consciousness, but on intelligence. The view of the matter is, however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.|$|E
5|$|Married people, however, {{are advised}} not to worship Dhumavati. It {{is said that}} her worship creates a feeling of wanting {{solitude}} and distaste of worldly things, which is considered as highest characteristics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spiritual</b> quest. Thus, Dhumavati's worship is appropriate for world renouncers who roam as lone wanderers and widows who parallel the life of world renouncers. Dhumavati is also described a being partial to single persons and especially partial to widows. Widows are considered the only beings who can withstand her power.|$|E

5|$|Symeon is {{recognized}} as the first Byzantine mystic to freely share his own mystical experiences. Some of his writings {{are included in the}} Philokalia, a collection of texts by early Christian mystics on contemplative prayer and hesychast teachings. Symeon wrote and spoke frequently about the importance of experiencing directly the grace of God, often talking about his own experiences of God as divine light. Another common subject in his writings was the need of putting oneself under the guidance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spiritual</b> father. The authority for many of his teachings derived from the traditions of the Desert Fathers, early Christian monks and ascetics. Symeon's writings include Hymns of Divine Love, Ethical Discourses, and The Catechetical Discourses.|$|E
5|$|Symeon often {{taught that}} all {{followers}} of Christ {{could have the}} direct experience of God, or theoria, just as the early church fathers experienced and taught. In that context he frequently described his own experiences of God as divine light. He preached to his monks {{that the way to}} God's grace was through a life of simplicity, asceticism, sanctity, and contemplation, which was also the doctrine of the hermits and monks known as the Desert Fathers. In addition, Symeon placed great emphasis on putting oneself under the complete guidance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spiritual</b> father.|$|E
5|$|After GoldenEye 007 was released, Rare began {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spiritual</b> successor titled Perfect Dark. Using an upgraded {{version of the}} GoldenEye 007 game engine, Perfect Dark was released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64. Although the game features a setting and storyline unrelated to James Bond, it shares many gameplay features, including a similar control scheme, mission objectives that vary with the difficulty setting, and cheat options unlockable through quick level completions. While Perfect Dark was still in development, Martin Hollis left Rare {{to work as a}} consultant {{on the development of the}} GameCube at Nintendo of America. He would then form his own company, Zoonami, in 2000. Other members of the GoldenEye 007 team also left Rare to form Free Radical Design. The company would develop the TimeSplitters first-person shooters for the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox. These games contain several references to GoldenEye 007, including the design of the health-HUD, the nature of the aiming system, and the dam setting of the opening level of TimeSplitters 2.|$|E

5|$|The Master Institute of United Arts {{came into}} being in 1920 as the Master School of United Arts. It {{struggled}} to survive until, in 1922, Louis Horch financed its transfer from a single-room, all-in-one studio at 314 West 54th Street to a mansion he bought on {{the site where the}} Master Building would later be constructed. Horch's wife, Nettie Horch, was a friend of Frances Grant who directed the Master School for the Roeriches. Nettie and Louis were patrons of the arts and ardent believers in art education as an indirect means of promoting harmony among the peoples of the world. They were attracted to the spiritual quest in which the Roeriches were engaged and participated in sessions during which Helena Roerich would receive instructions from Master Morya (or other esoteric beings) and Nicholas Roerich would record them on scrolls of paper that were later transcribed into a series of texts, the Leaves of Morya's Garden. Their teachings became the core <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spiritual</b> and cultural movement known as Roerichism.|$|E

25|$|Craig's and Stanislavski's {{interpretations of}} {{the central role of}} Shakespeare's play, however, were quite different.
