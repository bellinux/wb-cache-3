5|$|Some theory {{requires}} {{selecting a}} fixed {{point on the}} sphere, calling the pair (sphere, point) a pointed sphere. For some spaces the choice matters, but for a sphere all points are equivalent so the choice {{is a matter of}} convenience. The point (1, 0, 0, …, 0), which is on the equator of all the spheres, works well for geometric spheres; the (collapsed) rim of the disk is another <b>obvious</b> <b>choice.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of sound cinema, among the various {{distinguished}} composers ready to try their hand at film music, Prokofiev was not an <b>obvious</b> <b>choice</b> for the commission. Based in Paris for almost a decade, he had a reputation for experimentation and dissonance, characteristics at odds with the cultural norms of the Soviet Union. By early 1933, however, Prokofiev was anxious to return to his homeland, and saw the film commission as an opportunity to write music in a more popular and accessible style.|$|E
5|$|James Clark Ross's 1839–43 Antarctic {{expedition}} in HMS Erebus and HMS Terror was {{a full-scale}} Royal Naval enterprise, the principal function {{of which was}} to test current theories on magnetism, {{and to try to}} locate the South Magnetic Pole. The expedition had first been proposed by leading astronomer Sir John Herschel, and was supported by the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Ross had considerable past experience in magnetic observation and Arctic exploration; in May 1831 he {{had been a member of}} a party that had reached the location of the North Magnetic Pole, and he was an <b>obvious</b> <b>choice</b> as commander.|$|E
50|$|The Browns and 49ers, as the AAFC's two strongest teams, were <b>obvious</b> <b>choices.</b> (San Francisco {{was also}} a natural fit as a {{geographic}} rival to the Rams, who were alone on the West Coast at the time.) The third choice {{was the subject of}} some debate.|$|R
5000|$|Writing for the Evening Standard, Pete Clark {{awarded the}} album four stars {{out of five}} and stated, [...] "In typical Gabriel fashion <b>obvious</b> <b>choices</b> have been avoided: no Sledgehammer or Biko here. Instead, he and arranger/composer John Metcalfe have opted for songs that might best benefit from the grown-up treatment. Mostly, {{it is a great}} success." ...|$|R
40|$|Combined with {{elevation}} data, orthomosaics are now {{among the}} main (end or intermediate) photogrammetric products for archaeological documentation. But DEM collection/editing and orthorectification/orthomosaicking may well necessita- te powerful tools − according to object size, scale, accuracy requirements and, hence, number {{of images and}} scanning resolution.

5|$|The 1880s was {{a decade}} of growing {{national}} prosperity, and increasing numbers of families from the expanding middle classes were sending their sons to boarding schools. The B.O.P. editor, George Hutchison, felt that such schools would provide the ideal setting for stories in which a boy hero (or heroes) could display Christian principles and strength of character {{in the face of}} temptations, and planned to run a long serial story. Reed, who had not himself attended a boarding school, was not the <b>obvious</b> <b>choice</b> as the writer. However, the skill and imagination he had displayed in his short school stories convinced Hutchison that Reed should be given the assignment.|$|E
5|$|This {{still left}} {{the problem of}} getting {{government}} support for uranium research. Another friend of Szilárd's, the Austrian economist Gustav Stolper, suggested approaching Alexander Sachs, who had access to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sachs told Szilárd that he had already spoken to the President about uranium, but that Fermi and Pegram had reported that the prospects for building an atomic bomb were remote. He told Szilárd that he would deliver the letter, but suggested that it come from someone more prestigious. For Szilárd, Einstein was again the <b>obvious</b> <b>choice.</b> Sachs and Szilárd drafted a letter riddled with spelling errors and mailed it to Einstein.|$|E
5|$|The Genghis Khan {{concentrates}} on {{the rise of the}} divided, constantly warring tribes of Mongolia into the mighty, fearsome Mongol Empire. Early missions of the campaign concentrate on uniting the several steppe tribes whilst also dealing with the 'Kara-Khitai', sworn enemies of Genghis Khan. With the other tribes either united or destroyed, Genghis now sets his eyes on world domination. The vast riches of the Khwaremia domain in Persia would be the <b>obvious</b> <b>choice,</b> but despite a pledge of support to the Mongols, the technologically superior Chinese Kingdoms have refused, thereby setting another example where Genghis directs his next campaign. With the entirety of China now under Mongolian rule, the Mongol horde now has the technology capable of knocking down the fortifications of Persia, and beyond.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{textbooks}} {{on research}} methods tend to ignore, or gloss over, how research questions are constructed. In this text, Mats Alvesson & Jorgen Sandberg seek to challenge researchers to look past the easy or <b>obvious</b> <b>choices</b> and create {{more interesting and}} rewarding questions. Joanna Lenihan feels that this is potentially a valuable and practical tool for researchers and could be integrated into required reading for research students in the {{humanities and social sciences}} embarking on research...|$|R
50|$|In topology, the {{cartesian}} product of topological spaces {{can be given}} several different topologies. One of the more <b>obvious</b> <b>choices</b> is the box topology, where a base is given by the Cartesian products of open sets in the component spaces. Another possibility is the product topology, where a base is given by the Cartesian products of open sets in the component spaces, only finitely many {{of which can be}} not equal to the entire component space.|$|R
5|$|The ZX81 was {{launched}} on 5 March 1981 in two versions (though with identical components) – a pre-assembled machine or a cheaper kit version, which the user could assemble himself. Both versions were manufactured in Dundee, Scotland by Timex Corporation at the company's Dryburgh factory. Timex {{had not been}} an <b>obvious</b> <b>choice</b> of manufacturing subcontractor, as the company had little previous experience in assembling electronics. It was a well-established manufacturer of mechanical watches but was facing a crisis {{at the beginning of}} the 1980s. Profits had dwindled to virtually zero as the market for mechanical watches stagnated in the face of competition from the digital and quartz watches. Recognising the trend, Timex's director, Fred Olsen, determined that the company would diversify into other areas of business.|$|E
5|$|The {{demolition}} of the residential towers that {{had served as}} the Barksdale organization's prime territory pushes their dealers back out onto the streets of Baltimore. Stringer Bell continues his reform of the organization by cooperating with other drug lords, sharing with one another territory, product and profits. Stringer's proposal is met with a curt refusal from Marlo Stanfield, leader of a new, growing crew. Against Stringer's advice, Avon decides to take Marlo's territory by force and the two gangs become embroiled in a bitter turf war with multiple deaths. Omar Little continues to rob the Barksdale organization wherever possible. Working with his new boyfriend Dante and two women, he is once more a serious problem. The violence related to the drug trade makes it an <b>obvious</b> <b>choice</b> of investigation for Cedric Daniels' permanently established Major Crimes Unit.|$|E
5|$|When Friedrich Wilhelm IV {{came to the}} Prussian throne in 1840 with ambitions {{to develop}} Berlin as a {{cultural}} centre (including {{the establishment of a}} music school, and reform of music for the church), the <b>obvious</b> <b>choice</b> to head these reforms was Mendelssohn. He was reluctant to undertake the task, especially in the light of his existing strong position in Leipzig. Mendelssohn nonetheless spent some time in Berlin, writing some church music, and, at the King's request, music for productions of Sophocles's Antigone (1841) and Oedipus at Colonus (1845), Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1843) and Racine's Athalie (1845). But the funds for the school never materialised, and various of the court's promises to Mendelssohn regarding finances, title, and concert programming were broken. He was therefore not displeased to have the excuse to return to Leipzig.|$|E
5000|$|The sounds {{range from}} the upbeat ("Communism") to the downbeat (""Nuthin' To Do""), and from the smooth and sleek ("I Used to Love H.E.R."), to the rugged ("Sum Shit I Wrote"). Similar to other Hip hop {{productions}} of the time, the sources {{for many of the}} samples are from less <b>obvious</b> <b>choices</b> such as The New Apocalypse, and their cover of [...] "Get Out Of My Life, Woman", which is used for the song [...] "Watermelon".|$|R

50|$|Firing verdict: Despite brief {{consideration}} {{being given}} to Meat Loaf due to the argument he caused early in the task, Richard Hatch and Gary Busey quickly became the <b>obvious</b> <b>choices</b> for bringing in the least money and being generally agreed to be the two weakest members of the team. Despite the men arguing that Richard would be stronger going forward, Marlee Matlin persuaded Trump that money raised should be the sole deciding factor. As Richard brought in less than half Gary's total, he was therefore fired.|$|R
5|$|In December 1935, No.1 AD's workshops, {{under the}} command of Squadron Leader Arthur Murphy, {{specially}} modified a Wapiti and a deHavilland Gipsy Moth for Antarctic conditions, to enable an Air Force team led by Flight Lieutenant (later Group Captain) Eric Douglas and Flying Officer Alister Murdoch to rescue explorer Lincoln Ellsworth, who was presumed lost on a journey across the continent. On 3May 1937, Recruit Training Squadron acquired a new sub-unit, the Communications and Survey Flight, utilising Tugan Gannets and Dragon Rapides for ongoing photographic survey work; the squadron was re-formed as No.1 Recruit Depot on 2March 1940. Coupled with its aircraft assembly and test facilities, the recruit training unit made Laverton an <b>obvious</b> <b>choice</b> for the establishment of future RAAF squadrons. No.1 AD's commanding officers during this decade included Wing Commanders Frank McNamara (February 1933 to April 1936), Frank Lukis (April 1936 to January 1938), and Arthur Murphy (January 1938 to May 1940).|$|E
5|$|One of Groves' early {{problems}} {{was to find}} a director for Project Y, the group that would design and build the bomb. The <b>obvious</b> <b>choice</b> was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, but they could not be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb design concepts. However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a Nobel Prize, which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were Communists, including his brother, Frank Oppenheimer; his wife, Kitty; and his girlfriend, Jean Tatlock. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Siddharth {{was because of}} the sheer {{relevance}} to the character in real life. However, they finalized the choice of the actor only after the script was ready. The choice of Genelia was based on her natural vivacity in real life. This and her eyes, according to Bhaskar, made her an <b>obvious</b> <b>choice</b> for her character. More so, she liked the one line story that Raju told and also a few scenes that he narrated to her. She immediately liked the character and consented for the role. The fact that her co-actor, Siddharth and she acted earlier together in Boys (2003), made them more comfortable to work with. The camaraderie that the lead actors shared during the filming, added to their good performances. The choice of Prakash Raj was easy as he befitted the character he portrayed while, Jayasudha was persuaded {{to play the role of}} the lead actor's mother.|$|E
50|$|Joe Avezzano {{compiled}} a 6-47-2 record at Oregon State from 1980 to 1984. The university allowed his five-year contract {{to expire on}} November 23. After Oakland Raiders' assistant coach, Sam Boghosian, withdrew his name from consideration, Idaho's head coach, Dennis Erickson, became the front runner. Erickson wanted the job, and Athletic Director, and former head coach, Dee Andros, wanted to hire him. However, President John Byrne waited. Eventually, Erickson withdrew his name for consideration along {{with a couple of}} the other more <b>obvious</b> <b>choices.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On June 25, 1841, Macomb died, and Scott and Gaines {{were still}} {{the two most}} <b>obvious</b> <b>choices</b> for the Commanding General's post. [...] John Bell, the Secretary of War, had no {{interest}} in rekindling the Scott/Gaines seniority dispute; he quickly recommended Scott to President John Tyler. [...] Tyler approved, and Scott assumed office on July 5, 1841. [...] He was promoted to permanent major general, then the highest rank in the Army, with June 25, 1841, as his date of rank. (Gaines became increasingly marginalized as Scott continued to gain influence, and died in 1849 while still on active duty.) ...|$|R
50|$|Firing verdict: Anand and Steuart {{were quickly}} deemed safe, as their {{outfitting}} {{choices for the}} models were agreed {{to have been the}} sole positive aspect of Octane's show. Similarly, Clint was also not in danger, as Trump did not see him as being responsible for the loss in any real way. This left Wade and Gene as the <b>obvious</b> <b>choices</b> (though David also put himself in the firing line by making offensive remarks about his team-mates), and eventually Gene admitted that he deserved to be fired. Trump therefore fired him, and then immediately proceeded to fire Wade also.|$|R
5|$|The <b>obvious</b> <b>choice</b> for {{a supreme}} {{commander}} in the Pacific was General Douglas MacArthur. He had been ordered to leave the Philippines for Australia to take command of a reconstituted ABDA area on 22 February 1942, and had therefore been promised the command even before there were discussions on what it should be. MacArthur had solid support from the President, the Army and the American people, but not the Navy. The Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest King, saw the Pacific lines of communication primarily as a naval responsibility and would not yield command to an Army officer and proposed a division placing all of the Solomons within the Australian area, but excluding the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, and New Zealand. While the Army planners, led by Brigadier General Dwight Eisenhower, were willing to compromise on a divided command, they objected to placing Australia and New Zealand in separate theatres. The Joint Chiefs of Staff discussed the matter between 9 and 16 March, the result {{of which was a}} decision to adopt the Navy's plan, with only minor amendments.|$|E
5|$|The story {{involved}} a strange force compelling Jamie to pilot the TARDIS to Scotland in 1746 where the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe find themselves isolated from their ship by a forcefield. They {{arrive at the}} foreboding Castle McCrimmon, Jamie's ancestral home near a misty loch. There they are met by Duncan, Factor to the ailing Laird, Sir James McCrimmon. Jamie shows Zoe around and she notices some strange cattle which then stand up - they are Yeti. The Yeti isolate the castle and the villagers fall {{under the influence of}} the Great Intelligence. One villager, Fiona, is immune and Jamie falls in love with her. The Intelligence aims to gain control of Jamie's body and settle in the castle as the Laird of McCrimmon when Sir James dies. The Doctor has to determine who the Intelligence is working through, with the Laird and the village sorceress being the prime candidates. It transpires that Duncan is protecting Fiona's mother, Morag - a woman with second sight. The Intelligence is defeated and, after Sir James dies with no heirs, Jamie is the last of the clan and is therefore the <b>obvious</b> <b>choice</b> for the new Laird. Accepting his rightful inheritance and responsibility, Jamie bids a reluctant farewell to the Doctor and Zoe to remain with Fiona as the new Laird.|$|E

5000|$|For {{her next}} Edinburgh show, in 2005, Neary was {{directed}} by David Sant of Peepolykus.

'Infrared' and 'Ultraviolet' are <b>obvious</b> <b>choices,</b> but we will also examine the marketability of albums named after the other regions.

25|$|Practice {{showed the}} 4 strokes {{generating}} 10 to 15 more Hp and turning in much faster lap times than their 2 stroke counterparts. 4 stroke engines {{would be the}} <b>obvious</b> <b>choice</b> for years to come. Moto2 and 3 are four-stroke only.|$|E
25|$|After the {{international}} retirement of John Eales in 2001, Gregan became the Wallabies captain.

25|$|The two {{implementations}} {{are quite}} different. In ZFC, choose {{a representative of}} each finite cardinality (the equivalence classes themselves are too large to be sets); in NFU the equivalence classes themselves are sets, and are thus an <b>obvious</b> <b>choice</b> for objects to stand in for the cardinalities. However, the arithmetic of the two theories is identical: the same abstraction is implemented by these two superficially different approaches.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the merger}} {{negotiations}} in June 1976, the NBA {{made it clear}} that it would accept only four ABA teams, not five. The Nuggets and Nets, clearly the ABA's two strongest teams, were <b>obvious</b> <b>choices.</b> The Spurs had posted impressive attendance numbers since moving from Dallas, and were thus a very attractive choice. With the Bulls letting it be known they would object to the Colonels being part of any merger, the Pacers were the next most viable choice. [...] Brown saw {{the writing on the wall}} and decided that it was better to fold the Colonels for cash, instead of continuing to fight.|$|R
40|$|The recent glut in {{the world}} market for shrimp dealt a heavy blow to the {{aquaculture}} industry. It is thus apparent that fish farmers should not depend on only a single species for culture.

On the other hand, milkfish and rabbitfish are cheaper sources of protein and they already contribute substantially to fish production from aquaculture [...] 56. 2 % from milkfish for example (Rabanal 1988).
