40|$|More than {{of large}} {{software}} projects suffer large cost and schedule <b>overruns</b> <b>or</b> fail outright. <b>Deficits</b> in project requirements cause {{more than half}} of these failures and overruns. This is in part because the establishing of software requirements is fraught with complexity. Finding ways to manage that complexity might be an important step in reducing the risk of software development. Group Support Systems (GSS) offer functionality that may reduce some aspects of complexity and reduce the cognitive load of addressing other aspects of complexity. In this paper we examine the sources of causes of complexity in software requirements in the context of EasyWinWin, a requirements negotiation methodology supported by GSS. Early field trials suggest that EasyWinWin is a significant step forward in managing the complexity of establishing requirements, and that further advantage could be gained by combining a GSS solution with other technologies like intelligent agents and requirements management systems...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe thesis identifies conditions associated with production cost <b>overruns</b> <b>or</b> underruns on major weapon systems. The analysis used U. S. military fighter/attack aircraft. First, relying on techniques developed in prior studies, {{measures of the}} technology embodied in aircraft {{and the cost of}} producing those aircraft were developed. Next, relationships between technology and cost were examined to create measures of "should costs", for each aircraft based on technology in the aircraft. These estimates of "should costs" were compared to actual costs to determine situations of cost overruns and underruns. Analyses of financial ratios of each aircraft's prime contractor were used to determine if financial condition could explain the cost <b>overruns</b> <b>or</b> underruns experienced during production, by using several forms of regression analysis. This yielded models relating financial ratios to cost <b>overruns</b> <b>or</b> underruns. Major findings indicate that financial condition does partially explain production cost overruns and underruns, but the relationship is small. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
