40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the trend of oil level production dependence on its <b>operating</b> <b>cost,</b> current oil price and expected revenue over a production period of 10 years (2003 - 2012). Results from both experiment and model prediction show that the oil production level is very significantly affected by its <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> and expected revenue at a particular current oil price. A three-factorial model was derived, validated and used for the response analysis. Results from evaluations indicated that the standard error incurred in predicting oil production level for each value of the expected revenue & <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> considered, as obtained from derived model and regression model were 0. 0401 and 3. 5 x 10 - 4 & 3. 7348 and 3. 7544 % respectively.

Considering that the CTRB derived from recycled materials, it is necessary to do the analysis of the effects on vehicle <b>operating</b> <b>cost,</b> because one of the parameters to measure the level of comfort and safety in driving path is determined by the condition of the pavement, which indirectly affects the speed generated in driving. This study aims to assess the extent of vehicle <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> incurred by the vehicle group I, IIA and IIB that have passed through the South Arterial Road, as well as to assess the influence of the compressive strength of Cement Treated Recycling Base (CTRB) on the vehicle <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> of group I, IIA and IIB. This research was carried out by conducting a survey to get the average vehicle speed data group I, IIA and IIB and the data collection of costs component for calculation of vehicle <b>operating</b> <b>cost.</b> The results of the data analysis showed that vehicle <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> incurred for the reconstruction along the 1. 75 km of roads across South Arterial Road are Rp 3. 486, 00 for vehicle group I, Rp. 12. 331, 00 for vehicle group IIA and Rp. 14. 850, 00 for vehicle group IIB.
