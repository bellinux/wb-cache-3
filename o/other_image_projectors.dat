50|$|Large scale <b>image</b> <b>projectors</b> {{have been}} pioneered by {{manufacturers}} Pani, Hardware Xenon and PIGI. These projectors are usually described as scenic projectors, and project light through photographic or inkjet media, unlike video projectors that reflect light off of LCD or DMD (digital micro mirror, {{sometimes referred to}} as DLP) devices. Despite advancements in video technology, still <b>image</b> <b>projectors</b> are still capable of many times the luminous output of video projection devices. Scenic projectors sometimes utilize roll based projection media, which allows quick access to hundreds of images and the creation of scrolling imagery, as well as rotating imagery.|$|R
50|$|The most {{powerful}} <b>image</b> <b>projectors</b> {{in the world}} are built by the company XL Productions. These one of a kind <b>image</b> <b>projectors</b> utilize large format lenses designed for Cold War surveillance systems, such as the U2 spy plane, and use other advanced optical systems and techniques to achieve image sizes and brightness levels far beyond that which is capable with commercially available projectors. XL Productions has presented imagery for events like the Olympics, the Super Bowl and other special productions. In 2000, XL Productions achieved projected image sizes as much as one mile across on Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{problems}} appearing in the virtual reality (VR) application is the image distortion and blending correction for curved screens with single or multiple projectors. There are ways {{to solve this problem}} via a special circuit implementation within the <b>image</b> <b>projectors</b> or via special image correction PC based boxes. In this study we proposed own algorithm for the image correction based on the back ray tracing approach. The algorithm is using reverse ray tracing and it was tested on the Cybersphere(1) setup. We propose the software implementation of the algorithm which allows using it for any programs not limited by a certain technology such as OpenGL for instance as in <b>other</b> <b>image</b> correction algorithms. The algorithm can be used for distributed image rendering and projection such as Chromium based sets. ...|$|R

50|$|A <b>projector</b> or <b>image</b> <b>projector</b> is {{an optical}} device that {{projects}} an image (or moving images) onto a surface, commonly a projection screen. Most <b>projectors</b> create an <b>image</b> by shining a light {{through a small}} transparent lens, but some newer types of projectors can project the image directly, by using lasers. A virtual retinal display, or retinal projector, is a projector that projects an image directly on the retina instead of using an external projection screen.|$|R

50|$|A {{handheld}} projector (also {{known as}} a pocket projector, mobile projector, pico projector or mini beamer) is technology that applies {{the use of an}} <b>image</b> <b>projector</b> in a handheld device. It is a response to the emergence/development of compact portable devices such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants, and digital cameras, which have sufficient storage capacity to handle presentation materials but little space to accommodate an attached display screen.

40|$|We {{projected}} a multispectral MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) scene into {{a prototype}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ocean Radiometer for Carbon Assessment (ORCA) [1] instrument using a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Hyperspectral <b>Image</b> <b>Projector</b> (HIP) [2]. The MODIS scene included some clouds over ocean, {{similar to what}} ORCA would measure during its flight. During the tests, the ORCA scan mirror was parked, and the projected scene was scrolled in the track direction in order to simulate along-track platform motion. The ORCA instrument measured the projected scene, and we compared the ORCA measured scene to the projected scene, in the spatial and spectral domains, in the near infrared spectral region. The results show reasonable agreement between the measured and projected scenes, and serve to provide confidence that the system was working as expected. We present the results and describe some of the details, which serve to form {{an example of how}} the HIP can be used to perform pre-flight testing of sensors with realistic scenes. [1] M. E.

It was mostly developed in the 17th century and commonly used for entertainment purposes. It was increasingly applied to educational purposes during the 19th century and was in wide use until the mid-20th century, when a smaller-format version for photographs on film, marketed and commonly known as a slide projector, superseded it.|$|R

40|$|Hyperspectral imaging for {{remote sensing}} has {{prompted}} development of hyperspectral <b>image</b> <b>projectors</b> {{that can be}} used to characterize hyperspectral imaging cameras and techniques in the lab. One such emerging astronomical hyperspectral imaging technique is wide-field double-Fourier interferometry. NASA's current, state-of-the-art, Wide-field Imaging Interferometry Testbed (WIIT) uses a Calibrated Hyperspectral <b>Image</b> <b>Projector</b> (CHIP) to generate test scenes and provide a more complete understanding of wide-field double-Fourier interferometry. Given enough time, the CHIP is capable of projecting scenes with astronomically realistic spatial and spectral complexity. However, this would require a very lengthy data collection process. For accurate but time-efficient projection of complicated hyperspectral images with the CHIP, the field must be decomposed both spectrally and spatially in a way that provides a favorable trade-off between accurately projecting the hyperspectral image and the time required for data collection. We apply nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to decompose hyperspectral astronomical datacubes into eigenspectra and eigenimages that allow time-efficient projection with the CHIP. Included is a brief analysis of NMF parameters that affect accuracy, including the number of eigenspectra and eigenimages used to approximate the hyperspectral image to be projected. For the chosen field, the normalized mean squared synthesis error is under 0. 01 with just 8 eigenspectra. NMF of hyperspectral astronomical fields better utilizes the CHIP's capabilities, providing time-efficient and accurate representations of astronomical scenes to be imaged with the WIIT...|$|R
50|$|A video <b>projector</b> is an <b>image</b> <b>projector</b> that {{receives}} a video signal and projects the corresponding image on a projection screen using a lens system. All video projectors use {{a very bright}} light to project the image, and most modern ones can correct any curves, blurriness, and other inconsistencies through manual settings. Video projectors are used for many applications such as conference room presentations, classroom training, and concerts. In schools and other educational settings, they are sometimes connected to an interactive whiteboard. In the late 20th century they were commonplace in home cinema but later lost market share to large LCD television screens.|$|R

Combiners may have special coatings that reflect the monochromatic light projected onto it from the projector unit while allowing all other wavelengths of light to pass through.

The first two conditions are easy {{to be satisfied with}} available camera calibration algorithm [4],[18] and well-developed image processing technique [19],[20]. However, the latter two are much more difficult to be achieved. Furthermore, since the projector cannot ‘capture’ like a camera, how to determine the corresponding pixel point on the <b>projector’s</b> <b>image</b> plane is a challenge. If the pixel point on the <b>projector’s</b> <b>image</b> plane is biased, as Figure  2 shows, the measurement error will be enlarged in a short baseline arranged Pro-Cam system.|$|R

5000|$|Several {{scholars}} and inventors, like Giovanni Fontana (circa 1420), Leonardo da Vinci (circa 1515) and Cornelis Drebbel (1608) possibly had early <b>image</b> <b>projectors</b> before {{the invention of}} the Magic Lantern. Athanasius Kircher's 1645 first edition of Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae included a description of his forerunner to the magic lantern: the [...] "Steganographic Mirror". This was a primitive projection system with a focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight, mostly intended for long distance communication. Kircher also suggested projecting live flies and shadow puppets {{from the surface of the}} mirror. The book was widely distributed and may have offered some inspiration for Christiaan Huygens' invention of the magic lantern in 1659.|$|R
