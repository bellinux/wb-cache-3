The approach uses selection mechanisms analogous to foveation and eye tracking in human vision to isolate motion components one at a time. Each observation estimates motion of a single patch undergoing simple translation. But a sequence of observations can interpret complex patterns containing discontinuities and transparency. Computations are implemented within an image pyramid to provide direct selection of signal components in space, time, resolution, and velocity. ...|$|E

Hinging hyperplane models are well suited to represent continuous piecewise linear models, but the hinge finding algorithm is guaranteed to converge only in local optima, and hence heavily depends on the initialization. We employ the principal Hessian direction to incorporate the geometrical information of the regression surface in the hinge finding process and can thus avoid the several random initializations proposed in the literature.

Fourier transformation of the model and insertion of the computable, discrete Fourier transforms of the variables produce an approximate model which is of non-linear regression type and is relatively easy to handle.

We define successive Blumenthal-Getoor indices of jump activity, and show that the leading index can always be identified, but that higher order indices are only identifiable if they are sufficiently close to the previous one, even if the path is fully observed. This result establishes a clear boundary on which aspects of the jump measure can be identified on the basis <b>of</b> <b>discrete</b> <b>observations,</b> and which cannot.

30|$|One {{contribution}} of single cell analysis {{relies on the}} existence of cellular heterogeneity within the same population of cells. Bulk-scale measurements, which rely on data averaged across thousands or millions of cells, report only average values for the population. Thus, the characteristics of a group can obscure the differences between the individuals in it. Because studies made at the single cell level are not subject to the averaging effect characteristic of bulk-phase population-scale methods, they offer a level <b>of</b> <b>discrete</b> <b>observation</b> that is unavailable with traditional biological methods [3]. Secondly, single cell analysis provides an approach to identify the differences between individual cells. By characterizing the single cells at different conditions, such as health and unhealthy, we can take the single cell as an ideal model to detect disease, test medicines, and develop drugs. Furthermore, analyzing the content within single cells would benefit the deeper understanding of cellular functionalities and behaviors. For example, in the field of immunology, single cell analysis can help us to monitor gene expression in complex tissues, to define different cell subsets, to get insights into both their functional capacity and their specificity, and to track antigen-specific cells [2]. Therefore, nowadays, techniques for single cell analysis have attracted increasing interests in cell biology and the life science.|$|R
