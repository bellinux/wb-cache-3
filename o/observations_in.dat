5|$|On August12, a {{tropical}} disturbance entered the Caribbean Sea {{to the south}} of Antigua, believed to have been a strong tropical wave. Moving westward, it developed into {{a tropical}} storm by August15, based on ship <b>observations</b> <b>in</b> the region. That day, it passed {{to the south of}} Jamaica and later turned to the northwest. Due to the ongoing War of 1812, there was a British blockade of American ships, which caused a lack of <b>observations</b> <b>in</b> the region. As a result, the storm's track was uncertain, although it is believed that the system entered the Gulf of Mexico by August18; that day, a ship reported hurricane-force winds. After moving northward, the hurricane turned to the northwest off the coast of Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|After the March 1976 coup, Berni {{moved to}} New York City, where he {{continued}} painting, engraving, collaging and exhibiting. New York {{struck him as}} luxurious, consumerist, materially wealthy and spiritually poor. He conveyed these <b>observations</b> <b>in</b> subsequent work {{with a touch of}} social irony. His New York paintings display a great protagonism of color and include Aeropuerto (Airport), Los Hippies, Calles de Nueva York (Streets of New York), Almuerzo (Lunch), Chelsea Hotel and Promesa de castidad (Promise of Chastity). He also produced several decorative panels, scenographic sketches, illustrations, and collaborations for books.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the nearest}} Sun-like stars with a planet, Epsilon Eridani has {{been the target of}} several <b>observations</b> <b>in</b> the search for {{extraterrestrial}} intelligence.

5|$|He {{had little}} impact on {{the running of the}} navy, but he was {{interested}} enough in navigation and welfare at sea to sponsor the publication of John Flamsteed's <b>Observations</b> <b>in</b> 1704. He was not one of the most colourful political characters of his day—he was content to spend his time building model ships—but he was a loyal and supportive husband to Queen Anne. Their marriage was a devoted, loving and faithful one, though beset by personal tragedy.|$|E
5|$|Holliday's {{original}} model {{assumed that}} heteroduplex DNA would be present on both chromosomes, but experimental data on yeast refuted this. An updated model by Matt Meselson and Charley Radding in 1975 introduced {{the idea of}} branch migration. Further <b>observations</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s led to the proposal of alternate mechanisms for recombination such as the double-strand break model (by Jack Szostak, Frank Stahl, and others) and the single-strand annealing model. A third, the synthesis-dependent strand annealing model, did not involve Holliday junctions.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, <b>observations</b> <b>in</b> the {{microwave}} {{part of the}} electromagnetic (EM) spectrum (0.1–10GHz) led {{to the discovery of}} the Jovian decimetric radiation (DIM) and the realization that it was synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic electrons trapped in the planet's radiation belts. These synchrotron emissions were used to estimate the number and energy of the electrons around Jupiter and led to improved estimates of the magnetic moment and its tilt.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, various {{observations}} from Earth {{were made of}} the limb of Triton using the occultation of nearby stars, which indicated {{the presence of an}} atmosphere and an exotic surface. <b>Observations</b> <b>in</b> late 1997 suggests that Triton is heating up and the atmosphere has become significantly denser than when Voyager 2 flew past in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In the end, four {{broadband}} filters were chosen, centred at wavelengths of 300 nm (near-ultraviolet), 450nm (blue light), 606nm (red light) and 814nm (near-infrared). Because the quantum efficiency of Hubble's detectors is quite low at 300nm, the noise in observations at this wavelength is {{primarily due to}} CCD noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at times when high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of <b>observations</b> <b>in</b> other passbands.|$|E
5|$|It {{states that}} {{the theory of the}} Arab hijackers was created by the CIA, and that these Arabs may not even have been aware that the planes were going to crash. Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites <b>observations</b> <b>in</b> support of the theory that the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow does not believe that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E

5|$|Like the spinner shark, the blacktip shark {{is known}} to leap {{out of the water}} and spin three or four times about its axis before landing. Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. <b>Observations</b> <b>in</b> the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump out of the water to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E
5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387 was a {{gravitational}} microlensing event {{detected by}} the Microlensing <b>Observations</b> <b>in</b> Astrophysics collaboration on July 24, 2009, which searches and documents chance and brief alignments of stars with other stars or objects; such alignments cause a gravitational lens effect, which bends light and causes distorted, but magnified, images {{that can be}} interpreted. The detection of two caustics were logged {{over the next few}} days by the South African Astronomical Observatory, the Perth Observatory, and the Canopus Hill Observatory in Tasmania, with a separation of about seven days between caustic events.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cultures}} have attached importance to astronomical events, and the Indians, Chinese, and Maya developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial <b>observations.</b> <b>In</b> the West, astrology most often {{consists of a}} system of horoscopes purporting to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict future events in their life based on the positions of the sun, moon, and other celestial objects {{at the time of their}} birth.

5|$|<b>Observations</b> <b>in</b> 2004 {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} an inner belt containing silicate material at a distance of 6.4 AU from the star. Silicate material was also detected at 16 and 30 AU from the star, with a lack of dust between 6.4 and 16 AU providing evidence that a massive planet may be orbiting in this region. Magnesium-rich olivine has also been detected, strikingly similar to that found in the Solar System comets and different from the olivine found in Solar System asteroids.|$|E
5|$|Observations of {{gravitational}} waves promise to complement <b>observations</b> <b>in</b> the electromagnetic spectrum. They {{are expected to}} yield information about black holes and other dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, about certain kinds of supernova implosions, and about processes {{in the very early}} universe, including the signature of certain types of hypothetical cosmic string. In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole merger.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>observations</b> <b>in</b> Hurricanes Anita, David, Frederic, and Allen also {{discovered}} that tropical cyclones have very little supercooled water {{and a great deal}} of ice crystals. The reason that tropical cyclones have little supercooled water is that the updrafts within such a system are too weak to prevent water from either falling as rain or freezing. As cloud seeding needed supercooled water to function, the lack of supercooled water meant that seeding would have no effect.|$|E
