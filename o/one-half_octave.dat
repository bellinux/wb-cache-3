40|$|We {{determined}} the audiogram of the Jamaican fruit-eating bat (Phyllostomidae: Artibeus jamaicensis), {{a relatively large}} (40 ^ 50 g) species that, like other phyllostomids, uses low-intensity echolocation calls. A conditioned suppression/avoidance procedure with a fruit juice reward was used for testing. At 60 dB SPL the hearing range of A. jamaicensis extends from 2. 8 to 131 kHz, with an average best sensitivity of 8. 5 dB SPL at 16 kHz. Although their echolocation calls are low-intensity, the absolute sensitivity of A. jamaicensis and other ‘whispering ’ bats does not differ from that of other mammals, including other bats. The high-frequency hearing of A. jamaicensis and other Microchiroptera is slightly higher than expected {{on the basis of}} selective pressure for passive sound localization. Analysis suggests that the evolution of echolocation may have been accompanied by the extension of their high-frequency hearing by an average of <b>one-half</b> <b>octave.</b> With respect to low-frequency hearing, all bats tested so far belong to the group of mammals with poor low-frequency hearing, i. e., those unable to hear below 500 Hz...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to relate the pitch of high-rate {{electrical}} stimulation delivered to individual cochlear implant electrodes to electrode insertion depth and insertion angle. The patient (CH 1) was able to provide pitch matches between electric and acoustic stimulation because he had auditory thresholds in his nonimplanted ear ranging between 30 and 60  dB HL over the range, 250 Hz to 8  kHz. Electrode depth and insertion angle were measured from high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans of the patient’s temporal bones. The scans were used to create a 3 D image volume reconstruction of the cochlea, which allowed visualization of electrode position within the scala. The method of limits was used to establish pitch matches between acoustic pure tones and electric stimulation (a 1, 652 -pps, unmodulated, pulse train). The pitch matching data demonstrated that, for insertion angles of greater than 450 degrees or greater than approximately 20  mm insertion depth, pitch saturated at approximately 420  Hz. From 20 to 15  mm insertion depth pitch estimates were about <b>one-half</b> <b>octave</b> lower than the Greenwood function. From 13 to 3  mm insertion depth the pitch estimates were approximately one octave lower than the Greenwood function. The pitch match for an electrode only 3. 4  mm into the cochlea was 3, 447  Hz. These data are consistent with other reports, e. g., Boëx et al. (2006), of a frequency-to-place map for the electrically stimulated cochlea in which perceived pitches for stimulation on individual electrodes are significantly lower than those predicted by the Greenwood function for stimulation at the level of the hair cell...|$|E
40|$|A {{spontaneous}} otoacoustic emission (SOAE) {{and external}} tones (XTs) {{were used as}} primaries f₂ and f₁, respectively (frequency of f₂ > f₁) to create 2 f₁-f₂ distortion products (DPOAEs). The DPOAEs primarily reflect active processes in the cochlea because low- to medium-level primaries less than 60 dB SPL were employed. DPOAE characteristics were determined and compared to what is known from the literature about DPOAEs created using two XTs. SOAE frequency and amplitude were also described. One hundred twenty-two women were screened {{for the presence of}} SOAEs to obtain 10 subjects for the study. XTs were presented to the ear at SOAE/f₁ ratios between 1. 08 and 1. 22. Sound pressure levels were incremented in 5 dB steps and extended from levels equal to the initial SOAE amplitudes to levels at which the SOAEs and DPOAEs disappeared into the noise floor. Amplitude and frequency of the SOAE, XT, and DPOAE were recorded by placing a low-noise microphone in the ear canal and extracted using Fast Fourier Transform analysis. Results indicated that the DPOAE amplitudes and SOAE suppression characteristics were variable across subjects. Despite the variability, the following trends were noted: (1) at larger frequency ratios, DPOAE generation and SOAE suppression were associated with greater XT levels; (2) DPOAE growth functions were characterized by slopes less than 1 dB/dB, a maximum, rollover and disappearance into the noise floor with increasing XT levels; (3) maximum amplitude DPOAEs were observed at frequencies approximately <b>one-half</b> <b>octave</b> lower than the SOAE; (4) DPOAE thresholds were associated with little SOAE suppression whereas the maximum DPOAEs were associated with a greater amount of SOAE suppression; (5) the most common SOAE frequency shift, in the presence of XT stimulation, was a shift to a higher frequency just prior to total SOAE suppression. Results are interpreted using an electrical circuit model (modified from Yates, 1990) and pictorial representations of the SOAE, XT, and DPOAE vibrational patterns on the basilar membrane (modified from Yates, Geisler, Patuzzi, & Johnstone, 1989) ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to measure the coordinated activity of populations of neurons in the central nervous system. Here, we use immunocytochemical localization of Fos protein, a nuclear transcription factor, as a metric for 2 ̆ 2 sound activation 2 ̆ 2 to examine the populational response in the rat auditory brainstem. Fos protein expression is intimately related to the rate and pattern of neuronal firing. ^ The first issue addressed is the threshold sensitivity of granule and non-granule neuronal cell types in the cochlear nucleus (CN). Our results show that most CN neuron types can upregulate Fos expression when sound activated, {{and the number of}} Fos-expressing neurons is directly related to sound level. The threshold for Fos activation in granule cells is lower than that for non-granule cells. The number of Fos activated granule cells saturates at high sound levels, while the number of Fos activated non-granule cells is a monotonic function. ^ The second issue addressed is the frequency resolution in the auditory brainstem. Fos expression was used to investigate the separation of neural populations in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) and the inferior colliculus (IC) activated by alternating tones at two different frequencies. We show that tones a quarter-octave apart will activate a single population of neurons, while tones of <b>one-half</b> <b>octave</b> separation or more will activate largely separate populations of neurons in the IC and the DCN. The width of the bands broadens with increased sound intensities, more rapidly in the DCN than in the IC. ^ Consequently, the last issue addressed the basis for lateral inhibition in the IC. To study intrinsic ipsilateral connections, small injections of a fluorogold and biotinylated dextran mixture were made into the IC to identify local circuits. Immunocytochemistry was then used to identify GABAergic neurons. Similar methods with larger injections identified the commissural projections from the contralateral IC. Our results show that 93...|$|E

50|$|Voltage {{control in}} analog music synthesizers {{is similar in}} {{principle}} to how voltage is used in electronic analog computers, in which voltage is a scaled analog of a quantity {{that is part of}} the computation. For instance, control voltages can be added or subtracted in a circuit almost identical to an adder in such a computer. Inside a synthesizer VCO, an analog exponential function provides the 1 volt per octave control of an oscillator that basically runs on a volts/kHz basis. Positive voltage polarity raises pitch, and negative lowers it. The result is that, for example, a standard keyboard can have its output scaled to that of a quarter-tone keyboard by changing its output to <b>one-half</b> volt per <b>octave,</b> with no other technical changes.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{supplemental}} magnesium administered prior to exposure to noise has an alleviating effect on temporary threshold shift (TTS). These studies have only used audiometric thresholds to demonstrate changes in the auditory system. However, to help determine the effects on outer hair cells (OHCs), a more sensitive measure should be used. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if supplemental magnesium administration prior to noise exposure has a beneficial effect on acoustic overexposure using a double-blind research design. This was determined by measuring distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) to determine any changes in cochlear OHC function. DPOAE amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements were analyzed for two groups of twenty participants (an experimental group and a control group). The experimental group received 150 mg of magnesium gluconate one hour prior to noise exposure. The control group received a placebo pill that was identical in appearance to the magnesium pill. Following noise exposure, the greatest changes in DPOAE amplitude and SNR occurred for the frequencies that were <b>one-half</b> to one <b>octave</b> above the frequency of the stimuli used. The greatest changes in DPOAE measurements were present immediately post TTS-inducing stimulus, with only slight changes present after 30 minutes and no difference between 30 minutes and 60 minutes post-exposure. These results were the same for both groups. It was concluded that this dosage of supplemental magnesium had no apparent protective effect on DPOAEs following intense noise exposure...|$|R
