5|$|Marine {{habitats}} can {{be divided}} horizontally into coastal and open ocean habitats. Coastal habitats extend from the shoreline to the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continental</b> shelf. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only 7 {{percent of the total}} ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continental</b> shelf. Alternatively, marine habitats {{can be divided}} vertically into pelagic (open water), demersal (just above the seabed), and benthic (sea bottom) habitats. A third division is by latitude: from tropical to temperate to polar waters.|$|E
5|$|The American {{white pelican}} has {{increased}} in numbers, with its population estimated at over 157,000 birds in 2005, becoming more numerous east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continental</b> divide while declining in the west.

5|$|The Battle of Princeton was {{a battle}} of the American Revolutionary War, fought near Princeton, New Jersey on January 3, 1777. Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis had left 1,400 British troops {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood in Princeton. Following a {{surprise}} attack at Trenton early in the morning of December 26, 1776, General George Washington <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Army decided to attack the British in New Jersey before entering winter quarters. On December 30, he crossed the Delaware River back into New Jersey. His troops followed on January 3, 1777. Washington advanced to Princeton by a back road, where he pushed back a smaller British force but had to retreat before Cornwallis arrived with reinforcements. The battles of Trenton and Princeton were a boost to the morale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> troops, leading many recruits to join the Continental Army in the spring.|$|E

5|$|The Continental Army had {{previously}} suffered several defeats in New York {{and had been}} forced to retreat through New Jersey to Pennsylvania.

5|$|The Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783 (also {{known as}} the Philadelphia Mutiny) was an anti-government protest by nearly 400 {{soldiers}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Army in June 1783.

5|$|Because most of {{the newly}} formed {{regiment}} surrendered to British and German forces at the Battle of Fort Washington on November 16, 1776, the service history of the unit's surviving element is complex. Although modern and contemporaneous accounts of the battle convey the impression that it {{marked the end of}} the regiment as a combat entity, {{a significant portion of the}} unit continued to serve actively in the Continental Army throughout {{most of the}} remainder of the war. Elements of the regiment served with George Washington's Main Army and participated in the army's major engagements of late 1776 through 1778. Select members of the regiment were also attached to Col. Daniel Morgan's elite Provisional Rifle Corps at its inception in mid-1777. The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was reorganized in January 1779 and was stationed at Fort Pitt, headquarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Army's Western Department, in present-day western Pennsylvania primarily to help in the defense of frontier settlements from raids by British-allied Indian tribes. The unit was disbanded with all other Additional and Extra Continental regiments during the reorganization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Army in January 1781. It was the longest serving Continental Army rifle unit of the war.|$|E
