40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{the impact of}} high DG penetration on protection coordination and proposes a protection scheme to mitigate the identified problems, in a network with high penetration of DG. The scheme emphasizes on keeping most DGs on line to supply loads during the fault, without putting DG or {{any part of the}} distribution network in islanding operation, whilst ensuring that the conventional <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> (breakers with <b>overcurrent</b> relays  reclosers  fuses) do not lose their functions and their proper coordination...|$|R
50|$|Inrush current, input {{surge current}} or switch-on surge is the maximum, {{instantaneous}} input current drawn by an electrical device when first turned on. Alternating current electric motors and transformers may draw several times their normal full-load current when first energized, {{for a few}} cycles of the input waveform. Power converters also often have inrush currents much higher than their steady state currents, due to the charging current of the input capacitance. The selection of <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> such as fuses and circuit breakers is made more complicated when high inrush currents must be tolerated. The <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> must react quickly to overload or short circuit faults but must not interrupt the circuit when the (usually harmless) inrush current flows.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] power {{transmission}} systems and industrial power systems, often the short-circuit current is calculated from nameplate impedances of connected {{equipment and the}} impedance of interconnecting wiring. For simple radial distribution systems {{with only a few}} elements, hand calculation is feasible, but computer software is generally used for more complex systems. Where rotating machines (generators and motors) are present in the system, the time-varying effect of their contribution to a short circuit may be evaluated. Stored energy in a generator may contribute much more current to a short circuit in the first few cycles than later on; this affects the interrupting rating selected for circuit breakers and fuses. An isolated generator may be specially designed to ensure it can source enough current on a short-circuit to allow subordinate <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> to operate properly.|$|R
50|$|In mains {{circuits}}, short circuits {{may occur}} between two phases, between a phase and neutral or between a phase and earth (ground). Such short circuits {{are likely to}} result in a very high current and therefore quickly trigger an <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device.</b> However, it is possible for short circuits to arise between neutral and earth conductors, and between two conductors of the same phase. Such short circuits can be dangerous, particularly as they may not immediately result in a large current and are therefore less likely to be detected. Possible effects include unexpected energisation of a circuit presumed to be isolated. To help reduce the negative effects of short circuits, power distribution transformers are deliberately designed to have a certain amount of leakage reactance. The leakage reactance (usually about 5 to 10% of the full load impedance) helps limit both the magnitude and rate of rise of the fault current.|$|E
5000|$|A {{system could}} be made entirely ungrounded. In this case a fault between one phase and ground would not cause any {{significant}} current. In fact, {{this is not a}} good scheme. Commonly the neutral is grounded (earthed) through a bond between the neutral bar and the earth bar. It is common on larger systems to monitor any current flowing through the neutral-to-earth link and use this as the basis for neutral fault protection. The connection between neutral and earth allows any phase-to-earth fault to develop enough current flow to [...] "trip" [...] the circuit <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device.</b> In some jurisdictions, calculations are required to ensure the fault loop impedance is low enough so that fault current will trip the protection (In Australia, this is referred to in AS3000:2007 Fault loop impedance calculation). This may limit the length of a branch circuit. In the case of two phases sharing one neutral, the worst-case current draw is one side has zero load and the other has full load, or when both sides have full load. The latter case results in 1 + 1@120deg = 1@60deg, i.e. the magnitude of the current in the neutral equals that of the other two wires.|$|E

It is {{demonstrated that the}} mathematical modeling of {{a part of the}} power system – viz. of the generalized electric power object – could be based on rigid and flexible models. Rigid models implemented on the basis of mathematical description of electrical and magnetic circuits of a power system can be considered as a reference model for the simulation results that have been obtained with the aid of another simulation system to be compared with. It is proposed to implement flexible models for generalized electric power object in the MatLabSimulink environment that includes the SimPowerSystems component library targeted to power system modeling. The features of the parameters calculation of the SimPowerSystems component library blocks that the power system model is formed of are considered. Out of the Simulink standard blocks the models of a wye-connected current transformers were composed as well as the digital overcurrent protection, missing in the component library. A comparison of simulation results of one and the same generalized electric power object implemented in various PC-based software packages was undertaken. The divergence of simulation results did not exceed 3 %; the latter allows us to recommend the MatLab-Simulink environment for information support creation for hardware-software based sets for digital overcurrent protection devices testing. The structure of the hardware-software based set for digital <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> testing using the Omicron CMC 356 has been suggested. Time to trip comparison between the real digital protection device МР 801 and the model with the parameters which are exactly match the parameters of the prototype device was carried out using the identical test inputs. The results of the tests demonstrated a close coincidence of results (the divergence of not more than 8 %), that confirms the possibility of using the suggested hardware-software based test set during the development and debugging of new digital relay protection devices...|$|E
40|$|Intentional {{islanding}} {{of electrical}} distribution systems raises potentials for customer {{backup power supply}} in future energy systems. An uncertain amount of additional expenses is needed to ensure an adequate and reliable protection system for the islanded mode of operation. Nowadays, customer installations are mainly equipped with low-cost <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> Their reliable fault tripping is assumed but is not verified in intentionally islanded grids built by multiple inverter coupled distributed energy resources. It is unknown, whether critical influences and requirements {{need to be taken}} into consideration in addition to a sufficient dimensioning of the sources. Potentially influencing factors are investigated by means of time domain simulations of an islanded low voltage distribution system containing two grid building inverters. One and three phased faults are investigated in main and final circuits of customer installations. A sensitivity analysis varies up to 32 factors simultaneously from the areas grid structure and parameters, dimensioning of inverters, inverter neutral current injection capability as well as structure and parameters of LCL-filters, control circuits, current limiting mechanisms and anti-windup. For the first time, these variation studies consider an increasing degree of inhomogeneity of structure and parameter settings and exploit a significant bandwidth of values per setting. A rule based procedure is created as a precondition for parameterizing the overall model and the control circuits. Adequate variants of inverter current reference limiting mechanisms are identified by means of a developed test procedure. For the first time, according mechanisms are systematically derived for grid building inverters with neutral current injection capability. Reliable tripping of <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> is achievable for single wire final circuits with tripping times lower than 400 ms, when a successful fault ride through can be ensured for an adequate quantity of grid building inverters. The required installed rated inverter currents are in the range from 0. 92 to 1. 18 times the <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device’s</b> tripping current. Influencing factors are the current limiting mechanisms used, the type of <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> installed and the inhomogeneity of inverter control structures present. Faults in main circuits experience a critical influence by a loss of transient stability during the fault (desynchronization) due to the resulting longer prospective tripping times. A reliable protection tripping is then impeded by the resulting gradual or cyclic reduction of the total fault current available. In case of three phased faults, the development over time can be estimated by a small number of factors. For one phased faults, an increase of the number of desynchronizing cases is observed with increasing degree of structural inhomogeneity. Dependable tripping is potentially achievable, when mechanisms for reliably avoiding desynchronization are utilized. In that case, an adequate number of inverters must ride through the fault. A fault ride through capability of the grid building inverters requires those to supply and tolerate phase voltages in the range of zero to 1. 08 *sqrt(3) p. u. and line-line voltages up to 1. 175 p. u. Partial loading and reverse power capabilities are required from the inverter coupled distributed energy resources. Cyclic overloading of single phases or complete inverters can occur especially in case of a desynchronization...|$|R
5000|$|In the UK [...] "Earthing" [...] is the {{connection}} of the exposed-conductive parts of the installation by means of protective conductors to the [...] "main earthing terminal", which is connected to an electrode {{in contact with the}} earth's surface. A protective conductor (PE) (known as an equipment grounding conductor in the US National Electrical Code) avoids electric shock hazard by keeping the exposed-conductive surface of connected devices close to earth potential in fault conditions. In the event of a fault, a current is allowed to flow to earth by the earthing system. If this is excessive the <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> of a fuse or circuit breaker will operate, thereby protecting the circuit and removing any fault-induced voltages from the exposed-conductive surfaces.

Maximum allowable earth fault loop impedance values and the characteristics of <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> are strictly specified in electrical safety regulations to ensure this happens promptly and that whilst overcurrent is flowing hazardous voltages do not occur on the conductive surfaces.

40|$|Increased Distributed Generation (DG) {{presence}} on radial distribution feeders {{is becoming a}} common trend. The existing <b>Overcurrent</b> <b>Protection</b> (OCP) scheme on such feeders consists mainly of <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> (OCPDs) such as fuses and reclosers. When DG {{is placed on the}} remote end of a 3 -phase lateral, the radial configuration of the feeder is lost. As a result, OCP issues may arise which lead to permanent outages even when the fault is temporary. This thesis presents a new approach that revises the existing OCP scheme of a radial feeder to address the presence of DG. The fuses on the laterals with DGs are removed and multifunction recloser/relays (MFRs) are added to address three specific OCP issues; fuse fatigue, nuisance fuse blowing, and fuse misoperation. The new approach requires no communication medium, provides backup protection for the DG unit, and allows the remaining laterals to retain their existing protective devices. The results are reported using the IEEE 34 node radial test feeder to validate the new approach and the IEEE 123 node radial test feeder to generalize the approach. The new approach completely mitigated the fuse misoperation and nuisance fuse blowing issues and most of the fuse fatigue issues that were present on the radial test feeders. Specifically, the approach demonstrates that coordination between the existing <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> on radial distribution feeders is maintained in the presence of DG...|$|R

40|$|Protection {{system is}} one of the {{important}} parts of the power system. The protection system can be accepted if and only if it is efficient, reliable and realizes some requirements. For protection of transmission line three stepped distance protection can provide remote backup protection to transmission line by zone 2 and zone 3, but during the calculation of operation setting for different protection zones of the distance relays, some problems have been raised (overlap and under reach). These problems cause improper trips in the network. The aims at overcoming the problems are by taking into consideration the specifications of the adjacent transmission lines, the effect of arc resistance, earth resistance and the effect of remote infeed. The line protection schemes are composed of distance relays and directional overcurrent relays where the setting of the relays must be computed considering both relays. Separate relay computation would lead to loss of selectivity. The standard IEC 60255 combined with the considerations of zone 2 tripping time have been used in order to overcome the coordination problems with the main protection (distance protection) as a local protection and to provide remote backup protection to the other overcurrent relays in the grid. In this project, the protection of the transmission lines in typical IEEE, 9 - busbars grid has been investigated in detail.

DGs in these {{radial distribution}} systems (RDS) introduce bidirectional power flows (BPFs) and contribute to fault current. These BPFs may cause unwanted tripping of existing <b>overcurrent</b> (OC) <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> and result in permanent outages for {{a large number of}} customers. This thesis presents a protection approach that modified an existing <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> scheme {{to reduce the number of}} customers affected by faults in RDS with DGs. Further, a technique is presented that utilizes customers loading information from smart meters in AMI to improve the sensitivity of substation OC relays by adaptively changing the pickup settings. The modified protection approach involves predefining zones in RDS with DGs and installing directional OC relays and circuit breakers at the zonal boundaries. Zonal boundary relays determine faulted zones by sharing information on the direction of detected faults current using binary state signals over a communication medium. The technique to adapt the substation relay pickup settings uses the demand measurements from smart meters for two 12 -hour intervals from the previous day to determine the maximum diversified demand at the relay?s location. The pickup settings of the substation relay for the two 12 -hour intervals during the following day for the zone supplied by the substation are adaptively set based on the current that corresponds to the maximum diversified demand from the previous day. The techniques were validated through simulations in EMTP/PSCAD using an expanded IEEE 34 node radial test feeder that included DGs and a secondary distribution level. By decentralizing the control of the zonal boundary breakers, the single point of failure was eliminated in the modified protection approach. The cases studied showed that the modified protection approach allows for selective identification and isolation of the faulted zones.
