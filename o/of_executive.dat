5|$|Exclusion of {{judicial}} review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect the exercise <b>of</b> <b>executive</b> power. Typically, this has been done though the insertion of finality or total ouster clauses into Acts of Parliament, or by wording powers conferred by Acts on decision-makers subjectively. Finality clauses are generally viewed restrictively by courts in the United Kingdom. The courts there have taken the view that such clauses are, subject to some exceptions, not effective in denying or restricting {{the extent to which}} the courts are able to exercise judicial review. In contrast, Singapore cases suggest that ouster clauses cannot prevent the High Court from exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise <b>of</b> <b>executive</b> power where authorities have committed jurisdictional errors of law, but are effective against non-jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E

40|$|The salient {{attributes}} of {{direct and indirect}} exporting methods of distribution were identified. Attitudes of three groups <b>of</b> <b>executives</b> (executives using direct exporting methods, executives using indirect exporting methods and nonexporting executives), were assessed towards the attributes. Attitudes were analyzed using ANOVA. The {{findings suggest that the}} three groups <b>of</b> <b>executives</b> hold significantly different attitudes about the attributes. The findings (1) Imply that executives using indirect exporting methods and nonexporitng methods are most alike in their attitudes; (2) offer an explaination for the tendency <b>of</b> <b>executives</b> to begin exporting with indirect methods and to switch to direct methods as exporting experience increases, and (3) identify the attitudes that each group <b>of</b> <b>executives</b> is most likely to hold. © 1979 JIBS.
