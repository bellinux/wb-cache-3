5|$|Owing to {{property}} {{on the road}} becoming more desirable, traffic began to increase on Park Lane during the 19th century. A short section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> was widened in 1851 {{as part of the}} redevelopment work on Marble Arch. In July 1866, following the destruction of the boundary railings after a demonstration supporting the Second Reform Bill, the road was widened as far as Stanhope Gate. In 1871, Hamilton Place was widened to allow an alternative traffic flow to Piccadilly.|$|E

5|$|Dedicated bus lanes {{have existed}} on the Kwinana Freeway {{since the late}} 1980s, when a project {{was set up to}} {{decrease}} bus commuters' travel times into Perth from suburbs south of the Swan River. In 1987, Main Roads Western Australia and Transperth trialled a contraflow bus lane along the Kwinana Freeway, from the Canning Interchange to the Narrows Interchange. The lane operated between 7:00 am and 9:30 am, the period with the most traffic congestion on the freeway. After two months, the results were examined, and the agencies decided to build an additional bus lane on the northbound carriageway. The construction included bus-only ramps {{at the beginning and end}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane.</b> The works were mainly funded by Transperth, which contributed $8.22 million out of the $10.23 million total cost. The remaining $2.01 million was provided by Main Roads Western Australia. The bus lane opened on 20 November 1989, and received an Institute of Engineers award for engineering excellence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{shows that}} a judiciously {{designed}} toll applied to a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> a highway can be a Pareto improvement even before the revenue is spent. I achieve this new result by extending a standard dynamic congestion model to reflect an important additional traffic externality which transportation engineers have recently identified: additional traffic does not simply increase travel times, but can also introduce additional frictions that reduce throughput. By using a time varying toll to smooth the rate that people depart for work {{it is possible to}} avoid these frictions, increasing speed and throughput. Because adding a toll increases throughput, if road users are homogeneous then adding tolls to all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> is a Pareto improvement. However, adding tolls changes the currency used to pay for use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway during rush hour from time to money. This change hurts the inflexible poor. We can avoid hurting the inflexible poor by only adding tolls to a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lanes.</b> Doing so preserves their ability to pay with time instead of money. I show that {{as long as there are}} some rich drivers using the highway at <b>the</b> peak <b>of</b> rush hour then adding tolls to a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> is a Pareto improvement. To confirm the real world relevance of this theoretical possibility I use survey and travel time data from California State Route 91 to estimate <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> adding optimal time varying tolls. I find that adding tolls to a four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> is a Pareto improvement, and that social welfare gains of doing so are over a thousand dollars per road user per year. 1...|$|R

Councillor Parker presented his land to the Ruislip Village Trust {{as the site of}} a future public hall, and the Trust passed it to the urban district council in 1964 stipulating that that would be the sole use.

In American professional basketball, defending team players are also prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds, unless a player is directly guarding an offensive player. If a player surpasses that time, the defending team will be charged with a defensive three-second violation, which will result in a technical foul where the team with the ball shoots one free throw plus ball possession and a reset of the shot clock. In all cases, the count resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Prison in Space by Dick Sharples, {{originally}} titled The Amazons, {{returned to}} the idea of a female-dominated planet last attempted with The Hidden Planet. The Doctor and Jamie were to be imprisoned, and Zoe was to start a sexual revolution and then be brainwashed. The four-part story was commissioned on 4 June 1968 and was intended to inject humour into the show. It was to feature Jamie in drag and end with Jamie deprogramming Zoe by smacking her bottom. The serial was rewritten to accommodate Frazer Hines' desire to leave by introducing a new companion named Nik, and again when he later decided to stay. Scripts for the first two episodes were delivered on 27 August 1968. The production team became unhappy with the serial, and when Sharples refused to perform further rewrites, the serial was dropped. The story was replaced by The Krotons. It was later adapted as Prison in Space by Simon Guerrier for Big Finish's The Lost Stories series in December 2010. In 2011, an illustrated scriptbook was released by Nothing at the End <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lane.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{city has}} been home {{to a number of}} famed authors. Most notably Charles Dickens– known for such works as Oliver Twist, A Tale of Two Cities, and The Pickwick Paperswas born in Portsmouth. Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes stories, practised as a doctor in the city and played in goal for Portsmouth Association Football Club, an amateur team not to be {{confused}} with the later professional Portsmouth Football Club. Rudyard Kipling, poet and author of the Jungle Book, and H. G. Wells, author of War of the Worlds and The Time Machine, lived in Portsmouth during the 1880s. Sir Walter Besant, a novelist and historian, was born in Portsmouth, writing one novel set exclusively in the town, By Celia's Arbour, A Tale of Portsmouth Town. Sir Francis Austen, brother of Jane Austen, briefly lived in the area after graduating from Portsmouth Naval Academy. More contemporary Portsmouth literary figures include social critic, journalist, and author Christopher Hitchens, who was born in the city. Nevil Shute moved to Portsmouth in 1934 when he relocated his aircraft company to the city; his former home stands in the Eastney end of the island of Portsea. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman grew up in nearby Purbrook and the Portsmouth suburb of Southsea, and in 2013 had a Southsea road named after his novel The Ocean At The End <b>Of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Lane.</b> Olivia Manning's childhood was also spent in the city.|$|E
