An invasion task force of 102 American ships carrying 35,000 American soldiers approached the Moroccan coast undetected under cover of darkness. French defenders interpreted the first contacts as a diversionary raid for a major landing in Algeria; and Germany regarded the surrender of six Moroccan divisions to a small commando raiding force as a clear violation of French obligations to defend Moroccan neutrality under the Second Armistice at Compiègne. An escalating series <b>of</b> <b>surprised</b> responses {{in an atmosphere of}} mistrust and secrecy caused the loss of four U.S. troopships and the deaths of 462 men aboard 24 French ships opposing the invasion.|$|E

On the morning of July 18, they passed Burk's Garden, and some houses and weapons were burned. At the foot of Walker Mountain, about [...] from Wytheville, the brigade's rear guard was {{attacked}} by Major Andrew Jackson May's cavalry of about 150 men. The rear guard {{at that time was}} Company C from the 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and it had also been assigned the task of guarding prisoners. The opposing forces had not expected a confrontation at this location, and May's force outnumbered the small group <b>of</b> <b>surprised</b> men from Ohio. May was able to free the rebel prisoners (many were from the company that had been captured in Abb's Valley) and capture Union soldiers. According to the report of Confederate General John S. Williams, Toland's brigade lost 8 men killed and 20 taken prisoner.|$|E

He also claimed it hurt Star Trek Into Darkness by being released shortly before the film. Later, in November 2013, Digital Extremes creative director Stephen Sinclair said to IGN that he was [...] "kind <b>of</b> <b>surprised</b> [...] to see one of the most awesome, popular and successful film directors working today slagging on that project". Video game insiders linked the poor reception of the game to the departure of Brian Miller in his role as the Senior Vice President of Paramount, as he had been heavily involved in the marketing for the game. Insiders had specifically attributed issues with the game to the [...] "ego" [...] of both Miller and his predecessor Lesinski, [...] "insisted this hallowed and cherished franchise was a key brand extension in the gaming vertical only to be compromised by disastrous results and reviews".|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{studies found}} a {{discrepancy}} between the display and feeling <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> Therefore, we assessed what factors influence the display <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> in children <b>of</b> two age groups: 8 - and 11 -year-olds. We manipulated the social setting (children either competed or collaborated), and the cause <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> (a surprisingly positive or negative event). We found that children used more features to express negatively caused surprise, compared to positively caused surprise and that 11 -year-olds used more facial features than 8 -year-olds. In a subsequent perception study, adults judged video clips with surprised and neutral reactions, for the degree <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> that was displayed. We found higher ratings <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> for negatively vs. positively surprised children, competing vs. collaborating children, and 11 -year-olds vs. 8 -year-olds.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} how to compute the intensity <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> in an artificial agent. Resolution of this issue is important for the further specification of the computational model <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> proposed by Macedo and Cardoso (2001) that was implemented in artificial agents “living ” in a multiagent environment. This model <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> is mainly rooted in the cognitive-psychoevolutionary model <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> proposed by the research group of the University of Bielefeld (Meyer, Reisenzein, & Schützwohl, 1997) and in proposals by Ortony and Partridge.

In {{the central part of the}} paper we suggest how a formal model <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> can be integrated with a formal model of belief change. We investigate the role <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> in triggering the process of belief reconsideration. There are a number <b>of</b> models <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> developed in psychology of emotion. We provide several comparisons of our approach with those models. ...|$|R
500|$|Victor {{was noted}} for his {{controversial}} relationship {{with both of}} his sons' ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), with whom he initially had a [...] father-daughter relationship. In 2003, Victor and Sharon shared a kiss, causing issues in her marriage to Nicholas; she left town to [...] "find herself". Victor supported Sharon throughout her legal problems, and paid her bail at first when she was wrongly convicted of murder in 2011. Case stated that she thinks Sharon thinks of Victor [...] "in a way like a father figure, but not quite. When she was younger she saw him as that, and then when she grew up she saw him less as a father {{and more like a}} hero", also stating that Victor is Sharon's [...] "security blanket". The dynamic of their relationship changed when Victor proposed a platonic marriage to Sharon in December 2011, and while they end up marrying, but it is annulled shortly after. However, months after the annulment, they begin a genuine romance. Joshua Morrow, who portrays Nicholas, told Soaps In Depth that he was [...] "always kind <b>of</b> <b>surprised</b> that Nick just accepted this from his dad", and that [...] "there were never any scenes showing legitimate anger".

And so I was kind <b>of</b> <b>surprised</b> and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is awesome!'" [...] Milian is currently recording her fourth album. [...] "We're just getting started on it," [...] she said. [...] "I've already halfway gotten there and when my mom and I went to Wayne and we played him some of the music, off the second song, he was like, 'I love it. Let's do this deal.' I have some music that's already going to be on it and the second half I'm working with them now. [...] When they did a little background check, they saw even the songwriting, {{all that kind of stuff}} adds on top of, alright, she's an actress, she's a pretty face, she can actually sing, but not to mention she's a songwriter.

500|$|Hopkins was {{generally}} expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins did say in June 1999 {{that he would}} only be interested if the script was [...] "really good". Hopkins says on the making-of feature on DVD that he couldn’t {{make up his mind}} to commit. [...] "I was kind <b>of</b> <b>surprised</b> by this book, Hannibal. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn’t make up my mind about it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about." [...] When the producers confirmed {{that they were going to}} film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: [...] "It needs some condensing." [...] The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest [...] of the script by Steven Zaillian. Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into [...] "Lecter's mind". [...] "I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit." [...] In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins explains why: [...] "It's as if he's making a statement—'catch me if you can'. With his big hat, he's so obvious that nobody thinks he's Hannibal Lecter. I've always thought he's a very elegant man, a Renaissance man." [...] In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence [...] "as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth", according to Hopkins. When the film moves to the U.S., Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short [...] "to make him like a mercenary, that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if they got... in his way".|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the facial}} {{feedback}} hypothesis (that facial display {{is necessary in}} the experience of emotion or a major determinant of feelings), in the case <b>of</b> <b>surprise,</b> some research has shown a strong [...] between the facial display <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> and the actual experience <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> This suggests that there are variations in the expression <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> It has been suggested that surprise is an envelope term for both the startle response and also disbelief. More recent research shows that rasing of the eyebrows does provide facial feedback to disbelief but not to the startle.|$|R

40|$|The {{expression}} of surprise—at something unexpected—is a key form of emotional display. Focusing on displays <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> performed {{by means of}} reaction tokens (akin to Goffman’s “response cries”), such as wow, gosh, oh my god, ooh!, phew, we use an ethnomethodological, conversation-analytic approach to analyze surprise in talk-in-interaction. Our key contribution is to detach the psychology <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> from its social expression by showing how co-conversationalists collaborate to bring off an interactionally achieved performance <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> Far from being a visceral eruption of emotion, the production <b>of</b> a <b>surprise</b> token is often prepared for several turns in advance. We also show how surprise can be recycled on an occasion subsequent to its initial production, and how surprise displays may be delayed by silence, ritualized disbelief, and other repair initiations. Finally, we consider some of the uses <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> as an interactional resource, including {{its role in the}} reflection and reproduction of culture.

40|$|While {{surprise}} {{is a common}} emotion in everyday life, some of its fundamental characteristics are still unclear. For example, what does surprise feel like, positive or negative? The emotion literature has been somewhat unclear about the experiential valence <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> Surprise has been depicted as a pre-affective state, or as an emotion that can be both positive and negative, depending on the goal conduciveness of the surprising event. Based on recent work on cognitive consistency and neuroscientific/psychophysiological studies on surprise, we explored the possibility that surprise may be a (mildly) negative emotion {{in a study of}} autobiographical recall of unexpected and surprising events (Experiment 1) and in two studies of facial expressions <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> (Experiments 2 and 3 a/b). The studies show that experience <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> and the perception <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> in others may indeed be initially negative. We furthermore show how linguistic features <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> and the temporal dynamics may have contributed to previous confusion regarding its valence.

40|$|International audienceThis paper re-examines the {{well-established}} {{distinction between}} expression and description of emotion as regards surprise.

Second, {{the investigation of the}} corpus data indicates that surprise lexemes – namely the noun surprise and the adjective surprised – differ from other emotion lexemes in that they do not systematically refer to the emotional state of an experiencer. The noun surprise can have such a state reading but can also evaluate a source seen as a salient unexpected referent. As for the adjective surprised, it may serve various argumentative strategies. These uses reflect the epistemic rather than emotional nature <b>of</b> <b>surprise,</b> which sets it apart from other emotions...|$|R

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} effects of stimuli discrepant with schemata of varying strength on three surprise components: The interruption of ongoing activities (indexed by response time increase), the focusing of attention on the schema-discrepant stimulus (indexed by memory performance), and the feeling <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> (indexed by self-reports). Response times were consistently found to increase with schema strength. This effect was attributed to the increasing difficulty of schema revision. In contrast, memory for the schemadiscrepant stimulus was not affected by schema strength, supporting the hypothesis that schema-discrepant stimuli are stored in memory with a distinct tag. Finally, self-reports <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> intensity varied with schema strength only if they were made immediately after the surprising event without any intervening questions, suggesting that self-reports <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> are highly susceptible to memory distortions. Surprise and Schema Strength 3 The purpose of the experiments {{described in this article}} is to contribute to the empirical investigation of the emotion <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> More precisely, the aim {{of the present study was}} to examine {{the effects of}} the strength of the cognitive structure or schema from which the surprise-eliciting event deviates, on three components <b>of</b> the <b>surprise</b> syndrome, namely the subjective feeling <b>of</b> <b>surprise,</b> the interruption <b>of</b> ongoing activities and the focusing of attention on the surprise-eliciting event.
