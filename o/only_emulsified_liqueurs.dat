The {{significance of this}} emulsified acid is that increases the permeability of oil-saturated cores by 96.1 % while by only 10.1 % for water-saturated cores. Pandya (2013) applied emulsified acids on high-temperature reservoirs ranging from 275 to 375  °F compared to non-retarded and gelled acids. He studied the stability of emulsified acids when corrosion inhibitor is added in. It {{has been found that}} <b>only</b> <b>emulsified</b> acid system sustained this high-temperature range as compared to other acids. Claims (2016), studied deeper well stimulation using improved emulsified acid systems at a high temperature up to 300  °F. The CT images for the treated core samples show that the stabilized acid system had less face dissolution and had the desired wormhole characteristics, i.e., narrow and directional propagation behavior with deeper penetration into the core sample. He concluded that stabilized system achieve up to three times increment in core permeability as compared to conventional acid system.|$|R
40|$|Marine {{long-chain}} polyunsaturated {{fatty acids}} (LC n- 3 PUFA) {{are associated with}} reduced risk for inflammatory diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and rheumatoid arthritis. These fatty acids, however, are rapidly oxidized, generating highly reactive malondialdehyde (MDA), 4 -hydroxy- 2 -hexenal (HHE) and 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal (HNE). These oxidation products may interact with DNA and proteins, thus possibly leading to impaired cell functions. Little {{is known about the}} formation of MDA, HHE and HNE in fish oil in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In this study, the effect of dynamic in vitro digestion of cod liver oil on the generation of MDA, HHE and HNE was evaluated using the TNO Gastro-Intestinal Model (tiny-TIM). Effects of pre-formed oxidation products, pre-emulsification of the oil, and addition of oxidants (EDTA and hemoglobin, Hb) on GI oxidation were evaluated. Formation of aldehydes occurred during GI digestion. However, <b>only</b> <b>emulsified</b> oil fortified with 11. 5 μM Hb oxidized to a degree that overcame the dilution induced by gastric secretion, which caused increased aldehyde concentrations in gastric lumen up to 90 min. The maximum levels of aldehydes generated in this study were 24. 5 μM MDA, 1. 6 μM HHE and 0. 07 μM HNE. Oils containing different amounts of pre-formed lipid oxidation products maintained the same oxidation ranking order during digestion, even though the relative changes were not directly proportional. Emulsification of the oil had an unclear effect in the gastric phase, but a pro-oxidative effect in the intestinal phase. In general, higher aldehyde levels were reached in the intestinal lumen than in the initial meal, demonstrating that GI digestion promotes oxidation. Hence, epithelial cells may be exposed to elevated amounts of reactive aldehydes for several hours after a meal containing fish oil...|$|R

The arthritis became chronic in 14 out of 31 rats, and ear and tail lesions were noted in some rats. No arthritis was induced by native type I collagen, denatured type II collagen, rabbit IgG, or buffer alone injected intradermally with adjuvant.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Oils, greases, {{and grit}} which collect on an {{aircraft}} during flight are removed on the U. S. Air Force washracks using an alkaline, water-base cleaner. Waste-flows from these washracks may include {{in addition to}} free oils, emulsified oils, and alkaline, water-base cleaners several other constituents such as acid skin brightners, paint stripping solvents, paint scrapings, and volatile cleaning solvents. A study of aircraft washrack waste characteristics and treatment methods is presented in this thesis. The first section is a review of available literature including past experimental analysis. A survey of current washrack installations and treatment facilities at 65 Air Force bases in the United States forms the second section. The final section of this thesis contains an experimental analysis of the washrack wastes and the treatment facility at Portland AFB, Oregon. Oil concentration, five-day BOD., suspended solids, total solids, and effluent over-flow are {{used to measure the}} waste characteristics and flow and to determine the efficiency of a gravity oil separator at the Portland base. A testing procedure for determining oil concentrations is developed. Tests of the inflow and outflow of the gravity oil separator showed the following ranges. Waste Characteristics: 5 -day BOD. (mg/ 1), Oil Content (mg/ 1), Suspended Solids (mg/ 1), Total Solids (mg/ 1) Influent: 530 - 3, 300, 1, 450 - 6, 400, 34 - 270, 690 - 2, 400 Effluent: 350 - 1, 250, 240 - 1, 130, 28 - 80, 500 - 2, 070 The conclusions drawn from the test results are as follows: 1. An acclimated seed was required for the five-day BOD. test of aircraft washrack wastes. 2. For oil concentrations in washrack wastes, the testing procedure presented in this thesis measured oil concentrations with an error of less than four percent. 3. The gravity oil separator at the Portland AFB provided an average BOD. reduction of 37 percent and an oil removal of 70 percent. 4. The effluent from the gravity oil separator contained <b>only</b> <b>emulsified</b> oils. 5. The average oil content of the treated effluent was 589 ppm.

40|$|The {{isolation}} and biochemical characterization of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant, which grows <b>only</b> when <b>emulsified</b> myristic, palmitic, stearic, or oleic acid {{is added to}} the growth medium, is described. The mutant contains an enzymatically inactive fatty acid synthetase complex. The gene affected, preliminarily designated by the symbol fas, exhibits a 2 : 2 nuclear inheritance pattern. The formation of fatty acid synthetase in yeast is constitutive and not subject to repression by long chain fatty acids. After extensive purification, the mutant fatty acid synthetase was obtained as an essentially homogeneous protein with a sedimentation constant identical to that of the wild type enzyme. A systematic study of the seven reaction steps involved in fatty acid biosynthesis revealed that the enzyme catalyzing the condensation of acetate and malonate to acetoacetate was completely inactive in the mutant. The other six component enzymes had identical specific activities in the mutant and in the wild type fatty acid synthetase complexes. It is concluded that the mutant described harbors a missense mutation in the structural genes of either the condensing enzyme of the „acyl carrier protein” component of the fatty acid synthetase complex...|$|R

Di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) {{is assumed to}} have low dermal absorption; however, previous in vitro skin permeation studies have shown large permeation differences. Our aims were to determine DEHP permeation parameters and assess extent of skin DEHP metabolism among workers highly exposed to these lipophilic, low volatile substances. Surgically removed skin from patients undergoing abdominoplasty was immediately dermatomed (800 μm) and mounted on flow-through diffusion cells (1. 77 cm(2)) operating at 32 °C with cell culture media (aqueous solution) as the reservoir liquid. The cells were dosed either with neat DEHP or emulsified in aqueous solution (166 μg/ml). Samples were analysed by HPLC-MS/MS. DEHP permeated human viable skin only as the metabolite MEHP (100 %) after 8 h of exposure. Human skin was able to further oxidize MEHP to 5 -oxo-MEHP. Neat DEHP applied to the skin hardly permeated skin while the aqueous solution readily permeated skin measured in both cases as concentration of MEHP in the receptor liquid. DEHP pass through human skin, detected as MEHP <b>only</b> when <b>emulsified</b> in aqueous solution, and to a far lesser degree when applied neat to the skin. Using results from older in vitro skin permeation studies with non-viable skin may underestimate skin exposures. Our results are in overall agreement with newer phthalate skin permeation studies...|$|R
40|$|The lipids {{extracted}} from chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants generated in vivo and hepatic-lipase-treated chylomicrons were emulsified by sonication. These emulsified particles retained {{the capacity of}} the native lipoproteins to be differentiated by the liver in vivo, i. e. only the particles derived from remnant and hepatic-lipase-treated chylomicron lipids were efficiently taken up by the liver. To investigate the role of phospholipids in this differentiation process, the phospholipids of all three lipoprotein preparations were separated from the remaining lipids by silicic acid chromatography. The phospholipid-free lipid fraction of chylomicrons was then emulsified with the phospholipids derived from each of the three lipoprotein preparations. <b>Only</b> the particles <b>emulsified</b> with phospholipids derived from remnants and hepatic-lipase-treated chylomicrons were efficiently taken up by the liver in vivo.

The induction of a chronic {{inflammatory arthritis}} in the rat by the intradermal injection of human, chick, or rat collagen obtained from articular carti-lage and emulsified in either Freund's complete (CFA) or incomplete (1 CFA) adjuvant has recently been described by Trentham et al. (1977). The incidence of arthritis was approximately 40 % in the rat strains tested and mainly affected the hind limbs. Both cellular and humoral immune responses to native type II collagen can be detected in these rats, and there appears to be some correlation between higher levels of sensitivity to the collagen and the presence of arthritis (Trentham et al., 1978). We here describe the induction and clinical course of arthritis in the rat using a different hetero-logous native type II collagen (bovine) and the humoral responses in arthritic and nonarthritic rats.

Lymph node cells derived from immunized DA rats and stimulated in vitro produce significantly more Interferon- 3, (IFN- 3,) than resistant Albino Oxford (AO) rats.

40|$|Bile acids, the {{products}} of oxidative catabolism of cholesterol by the liver, {{play an important role}} in the intestinal absorption of fat. Recent work suggests that these amphipathic sterols act not <b>only</b> as simple <b>emulsifying</b> agents but, more impor-tantly, also as the basic micellar structure into which the poorly soluble amphiphylic monoglycer-ides and long chain fatty acids become solubilized (1). It is largely as a consequence of the forma-tion of these "mixed micelles " that absorption of fat into the mucosal cells of the gastrointestinal tract is facilitated. It has been appreciated for many years that bile acids undergo an enterohepatic circulation with ab-sorption from the gastrointestinal tract followed by rapid clearance from the blood as the liver se-cretes these acid sterols back into the bile. The intestinal absorptive phase of this cycle is of con-siderable theoretical as well as clinical interest, since an understanding of the transport mecha-nisms whereby bile acids normally are able to penetrate the mucosal cell barrier no doubt will be necessary before the elucidation of the pathophysi-ology of certain malabsorption syndromes associ-ated with deranged bile acid metabolism is pos-sible. Yet, despite the potential physiologic im-portance of bile acid absorption, little detailed data are currently available concerning the transport of these sterols.

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of lipophilic drug candidates in development in the pharmaceutical industry calls for advanced drug delivery systems with increased bioavailability less day-to-day and food-intake-dependent. Many of these drug candidates possess poor water solubility, so that their dissolution rate in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) limits their absorption following oral administration. In the past few decades, various lipid-based formulations have been investigated to enhance the bioavailability of such challenging drug candidates and to increase their clinical efficacy when administered orally. Recently, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) have attracted increasing interests and, in particular, self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS). SEDDS and SNEDDS consist in micro- or nano-emulsions of oil containing the drug that spontaneously form in aqueous media on mild agitation. Usually, they use high amounts of surfactant that may cause degradation and instability of the drugs, being moreover toxic for the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of the present thesis was the preparation of novel self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems to overcome the shortages of conventional SEDDS or SNEDDS. To {{reduce the amount of}} surfactant, we formulated first a self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system containing high proportion of essential lemon oil, that was characterized in terms of drug solubility, formulation stability, viscosity, emulsion droplet size, ζ-potential and in vitro drug release. Then, a pH-sensitive SNEDDS was developed that <b>emulsify</b> <b>only</b> at basic pHs. The goal was to protect the lipophilic drugs from the harsh acidic environment in stomach and render it available in the enteric tract where the bioactive compound should be absorbed...|$|R
40|$|Emulsions, {{which are}} dispersions of two {{immiscible}} liquids (e. g. oil and water), {{are part of}} our daily life through many products that we use such as milk, mayonnaise, salad dressings, ice cream, lotions, shampoos, medicines, wall paints, etc. Many quality attributes of these products such as stability, texture, colour, visual and sensorial perception are affected by droplet size and size distribution. Conventional emulsification technologies such as high pressure homogenizers have poor control on droplet size distribution, they are energy intensive and not suited for fragile multiple emulsions. In the last decades, alternative emulsification concepts that employ microengineered structures have been developed. They can produce uniform droplets of a specific size using orders of magnitude less energy, and are suitable for multiple emulsions. However, most of these techniques generate one droplet {{at a time and}} the productivity of a single droplet generation unit is very low. To reach significant throughput, many units need to be run in parallel, which is far from trivial especially for the production of droplets below 10 micrometres. In this regard, EDGE (Edge-based Droplet GEneration) devices are better suited for upscaling since they can generate multiple uniform droplets simultaneously from one droplet formation unit. Unlike standard upscaling in industry, the characteristic dimension remains the same for microstructured (EDGE) devices, and issues related to upscaling were found to be linked to (sub-) micrometre scale (e. g. wettability and flow geometry). In EDGE emulsification, the contact surfaces need to be wetted well by the continuous phase, and in chapter 2 we show that the interactions of the liquids and surfactants with all available surfaces/interfaces influence wettability. In general, oils that have strong interaction with the surface can <b>only</b> be <b>emulsified</b> successfully in combination with surfactants that bind strongly to the surface. Also the pressure range in which droplets can be produced is greatly influenced by these interactions, e. g. proteins showed much wider pressure stability and an order of magnitude higher productivity, therewith also showing that EDGE emulsification is well suited for food-grade emulsions; that is as long as an appropriate combination of construction material and emulsion components is used. Also the geometry of the EDGE devices can be used to increase productivity. Previous research indicated that higher resistance on the plateau can improve the pressure stability, which inspired us to redesign the droplet formation units and place regularly spaced micron-sized partitions on the main plateaus, as reported in chapter 3. The micro-plateaus were positioned such that the number of droplet formation points was increased compared to regular EDGE, and {{it was found that the}} additional flow resistance resulted in remarkably wide pressure range while supplying oil to all micro-plateaus that were equally active, thereby leading to two orders of magnitude higher droplet productivity. Interestingly, at high pressures a second wide range generating approximately three times larger uniform droplets was discovered. In chapter 3, only one partitioned EDGE geometry was investigated for hexadecane and 0. 5 % SDS solution; therefore, in chapter 4 the underlying droplet formation mechanisms was investigated further by systematically varying the geometry of the micro-plateaus and the viscosity of the liquids. It was found that the micro-plateau geometry greatly influenced emulsification behaviour. The second regime, in which large droplets were formed, was only observed for narrow micro-plateaus, suggesting that a certain minimum flow resistance is needed for the second regime to occur. In the first regime, in which small droplets were formed, droplet size was dependent on the viscosity ratio of the liquids, in a similar way to that found for regular EDGE devices. The partitioned EDGE devices were upscaled in chapter 5 with 75000 micro-plateaus. This first upscaled device, the so-called multi-EDGE, was used to produce monodisperse hexadecane droplets of ~ 10 micrometres at 0. 3 m 3 m- 2 h- 1 (80 % micro-plateau activation). As expected, the differences in plateau geometry (due to technical limitations) compared to the devices reported in chapter 3 led to an order of magnitude lower productivity. Nonetheless, the initial results were promising, and provided clear leads to improve the productivity further. Last but not least, with the current multi-EDGE device enough product can be made to conduct rheology and stability tests for truly monodisperse emulsions. In chapter 6, we studied a different microstructured device, the packed bed premix emulsification equipment, and showed that food-grade double emulsions (containing 5 % v/v primary emulsion) can be refined at high throughputs, typically in the range of 100 ‑ 800 m 3 m- 2 h- 1, while keeping their encapsulation yield above 90 %. Droplet size reduction was similar to that found for single emulsions; the refined droplets were smaller than the pore sizes of the packed bed, and no marked fouling was observed under the conditions tested. Further, the process was robust and reproducible, making the technique a genuine option for double emulsion production. In the last chapter, chapter 7, we compare microstructured emulsification techniques on various aspects, and explain how the findings of this thesis help mitigate the identified bottlenecks (e. g. wettability, parallelization, productivity) that prevent upscaling of the technology. Finally, we conclude with an outlook on upscaling and discuss the aspects related to possible applications of the technology in the future.  ...|$|R
