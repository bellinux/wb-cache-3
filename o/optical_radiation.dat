25|$|In optical radiometry, {{sheets of}} PTFE {{are used as}} {{measuring}} heads in spectroradiometers and broadband radiometers (e.g., illuminance meters and UV radiometers) due to PTFE's capability to diffuse a transmitting light nearly perfectly. Moreover, optical properties of PTFE stay constant {{over a wide range}} of wavelengths, from UV down to near infrared. In this region, the relation of its regular transmittance to diffuse transmittance is negligibly small, so light transmitted through a diffuser (PTFE sheet) radiates like Lambert's cosine law. Thus PTFE enables cosinusoidal angular response for a detector measuring the power of <b>optical</b> <b>radiation</b> at a surface, e.g. in solar irradiance measurements.|$|E
500|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{findings}} of this study, the 10th CGPM in 1954 decided that an international system should be derived from six base units to provide for the measurement of temperature and <b>optical</b> <b>radiation</b> in addition to mechanical and electromagnetic quantities. Six base units were recommended: the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, degree Kelvin (later renamed kelvin), and candela. In 1960, the 11th CGPM named the system the International System of Units, abbreviated SI from the French name, [...] The BIPM has also described SI as [...] "the modern metric system". The seventh base unit, the mole, was added in 1971 by the 14th CGPM.|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{red blood}} cells known as LEH is a {{material}} that offers an excellent alternative to substitution blood since the chemical composition of the Oxy, LEH, {{is similar to that}} of the natural blood cells. Unfortunately, this alternative, like the natural blood, has a limited shelf life at room temperature due to thermal and/or solar (<b>optical)</b> <b>radiations</b> exposure. In this study experiments were run on LEH assays, with and without protection additives, to weigh up the effect of exposing LEH to thermal effect, using a digital controlled oven, and to <b>optical</b> <b>radiations,</b> using an appropriate apparatus to simulate the solar <b>optical</b> <b>radiations.</b> Constant evaluation of the acceptability of this artificial blood alternative was done with the help of an advanced computerized technique. The results of the experiment have shown that exposing LEH to thermal and <b>optical</b> <b>radiations</b> leads to a reduction of the concentration of the oxyhemoglobin and a heightened of the concentration of the methemoglobin. The rate of LEH degra dation in the two treatments was linked to the time in which they were exposed both to the thermal and <b>optical</b> <b>radiations</b> effects. Antioxidants, ascorbic acid and alfa-tocopherol were used in order to conserve and guard the prepared LEH from the degradation that happens to it due to the effects of both thermal and <b>optical</b> <b>radiations.</b> تصلح كريات الدم الحمراء المصنعة المعروفة باسم ل. ا. هـ كبديل ممتاز في عمليات نقل الدم ، وهى منافس جيد لنقل الأوكسجين ، تماما كما تفعل كريات الدم الحمراء الطبيعية،. ولكن للأسف فان هذا البديل الصناعي يشبه الدم الطبيعي في قصر مدة الحياة عندما يحفظ على الرف في درجة حرارة الغرفة العادية، وذلك نظرا لتأثره بالإشعاع الحرارى والضوئي. في هذه الدراسة تم عمل تحاليل حول عمل كريات الدم الحمراء المصنعة، مع وبدون اضافات للحماية...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Optical</b> Diffraction <b>Radiation</b> is {{generated}} when a charged particle bunch passes by an inhomogeneous boundaries, {{and is considered}} as the wakefield of a beam bunch. By using a tilted conducting slit, we can observe the interference pattern of the backward scattered <b>optical</b> diffraction <b>radiation,</b> which gives the transverse beam size information. Because the aperture of the slit is 10 times or more larger than the transverse beam size, this beam size monitor is non-invasive, which is essential to minimize the beam loss in beam size monitoring. The ratio of the photon intensity peak of the interference pattern of the <b>optical</b> diffractive <b>radiation</b> and that at {{the valley of the}} photon intensity gives the information of the transverse beam size. Most of the experiments on the <b>optical</b> diffractive <b>radiation</b> has been done only recently with electron beams up to around 1 GeV at TTF(Tesla), and at ATF(KEK).

40|$|International audiencePurpose:To compare {{microstructural}} changes {{along the}} <b>optical</b> <b>radiations</b> and brain structure volumes between glaucoma and control subjects using in vivo {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and to analyze their association with severity of the disease. Methods: 50 open-angle glaucoma subjects and 50 healthy age- and sex-matched controls underwent detailed ophthalmological examinations (including visual field testing (VF), funduscopy and Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography) as well as Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using a 3. 0 -Tesla MRI. Fractional anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity, Radial Diffusivity (RD) and Axial Diffusivity (AD) were quantified semi-automatically along the <b>optical</b> <b>radiations.</b> DTI parameters and volumes of specific brain structures were compared between cases and controls using conditional logistic regression. Association between DTI metrics and {{the severity of the}} disease was studied using linear mixed regression analyses. Results: In glaucoma subjects, optic radiations FA was significantly lower (0. 57 vs 0. 59; p= 0. 02) and RD was significantly higher (52. 78 10 - 5 mm 2 /s vs 49. 74 10 - 5 mm 2 /s; p= 0. 03) than in controls. Optic radiations FA was significantly correlated with homolateral functional and structural damage of glaucoma (mean deviation of VF (p= 0. 03), retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (p= 0. 03), vertical cup/disc ratio (p= 0. 0007)). Volume and DTI parameters of other brain structures (including hippocampus) were not significantly different between glaucoma and controls. Conclusion: We evidenced microstructural modifications along visual pathways of glaucoma patients and these alterations were correlated with disease severity. The association of glaucoma with other neurodegenerative alterations would need further exploration and a prospective follow-up of our cohort of subjects...|$|R
