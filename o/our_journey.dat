To date, the documentary has won six film awards.

The documentary also draws on many studies interviews of researchers, counselors and psychologists, along with interviews of numerous former military brats.|$|E
25|$|The Notre Dame review {{also noted}} that {{benefits}} from the restrictions weren’t enough to address the deep-rooted issues associated with alcohol abuse, and communities in the Valley needed continuing support. In her speech at the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commission Forum, Perth, 10 August 2009, Oscar stated that Aboriginal leaders in the Valley had taken their first steps {{on the path of}} reconstructing their communities but now needed the government to support them:It is a story of colonisation; the threat of losing our cultural authority to manage our societies; and the despair that has come from that disempowerment.It is a story of grief and trauma and the continued pain of living with grog, drug and violence.It is a story that academics and journalists write about us as though we are victims of history that we can do nothing about. And within their stories about us is an acceptance that the paternal hand of government will determine the nature of our welfare and even the nature of our rights.… I want to tell a different story. It is about how Aboriginal people can be the authors of our stories and not passive and powerless subjects in stories told and written by others.… I want to talk about how the leaders of the Fitzroy Valley in the Kimberley are working together to create a pathway of hope and community vitality and resilience… if <b>our</b> <b>journey</b> of social reconstruction could be measured as a one kilometre track, we have only travelled the first metre.The start of the journey has depended on the leadership of the Aboriginal community but the journey from this point on will largely be shaped by a partnership that we can create and build with governments.|$|E

2500|$|Along {{with the}} {{promotion}} of women's rights in the secular sphere, women in Utah, like renowned poet Eliza R. Snow, spoke of women's equality in sacred matters.

As written in poems by Mormon authors, [...] " [...] oversees key moments for individual souls in the Mormon progressive plan of salvation." [...] These ideas were expressed throughout the early 1800s. Today, church leaders continue to mention Heavenly Mother, although less frequently and embellished than in early church history. Neal A.

2500|$|The {{ride through}} the dreary tunnel with the dark waters of the canal beneath us, and an {{insecure}} chalk roof above our heads, enlivened as it is by occasional shrieks from the engine's vaporous lungs, and the unceasing rattle of the train, is apt to make one feel somewhat nervous; and the first glimpse of bright daylight that breaks upon us, relieves us from a natural anxiety as to the chances we run of being crushed {{by the fall of}} some twenty tons of chalk from above, or being precipitated into twenty feet of water beneath, with the doors of the carriages locked and no [...] "Nautilus belt" [...] around our waists and not even a child's caul in our pocket.

Indeed, its power is so predominant that it is not easy after a hasty reading to analyze one's impressions so as to speak of its merits and demerits with confidence. We have been taken and carried through a new region, a melancholy waste, with here and there patches of beauty; have been brought in contact with fierce passions, with extremes of love and hate, and with sorrow that none but those who have suffered can understand. This has not been accomplished with ease, but with an ill-mannered contempt for the decencies of language, and in a style which might resemble that of a Yorkshire farmer who should have endeavored to eradicate his provincialism by taking lessons of a London footman. We have had many sad bruises and tumbles in <b>our</b> <b>journey,</b> yet it was interesting, and at length we are safely arrived at a happy conclusion." ...|$|E

We stayed for some time with these people and made friends with them. Upstream from them lived the unfriendly Ethiopians whose land is full of wild beasts and broken up by high {{mountains}} where they say the Lixos flows from. They also say that about these mountains dwell the strange-looking Troglodytes. The Lixites claim that they can run faster than horses. Taking Lixite interpreters with us we sailed alongside the desert in a southerly direction for two days, then towards the rising sun for one more day. We then found {{at the far end of}} an inlet a little island five stades in circumference. We named it Cerne (Some scholars identify Kerne with the Island of Herne (23°50’N) on the coast of the Sahara) and left settlers there. judging by <b>our</b> <b>journey</b> we reckoned that it must be opposite Carthage, since we had to sail the same distance from Carthage to the Pillars of Hercules as from the Pillars of Hercules to Cerne." ...|$|E

40|$|In our duoethnography, we {{presented}} {{an overview of}} our cultural, educational, and social backgrounds to familiarize the readers with the authors. We then shed light on <b>our</b> <b>journeys</b> to and from Asia because they served as turning points in our lives and our families’ lives. These journeys served to frame and form our educational and vocational histories. Our intention in conducting this duoethnography was to explore both the past and <b>our</b> ongoing identity <b>journeys</b> from <b>our</b> present perspectives, which are informed by theories such as Post Structuralism. To that end, we challenged each other’s perceptions, beliefs, and cultural frameworks to deconstruct and dismantle our previous frameworks. We engaged in this in order to fashion a framework {{with which we can}} perform our identities in a third space (Kramsch, 2006; Bhabha, 2004). We collected data from face-to-face dialogues, frequent emails, and a collages we created. Above all, we attempted to make our conversations transparent in order that both the authors and readers could “witness the transformative process that is central to the method. ” (Breault, 2016). We hope this encourages readers to uncover their own journeys and to unfold their untold stories. Drawing on Post Structuralism, we turned to scholars such as Deleuze, Spivak, and Butler (Jackson 2 ̆ 6 Mazzei, 2012) to explore the data. Our findings centered on our individual, familial, and social identities, as well as revelations regarding <b>our</b> <b>journeys</b> so far, and wondering how <b>our</b> <b>journeys</b> will continue to bewilder us in the years to come...|$|R
