More-recent lines <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> Phobos having a highly porous interior, and suggesting a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates and other minerals known from Mars, point toward an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit, similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon. Although the VNIR spectra of the moons of Mars resemble those of outer-belt asteroids, the thermal infrared spectra of Phobos are reported to be inconsistent with chondrites of any class.|$|E
5|$|Because {{feathers}} {{are often}} associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> paleontologists. Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck, pubis, wrist (semi-lunate carpal), arm and pectoral girdle, furcula (wishbone), and breast bone. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through cladistic analysis strengthens {{the case for the}} link.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probably}} worth noting, {{if only to}} avoid confusion, that such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable to explain the phenomena) were often unfounded.

5|$|On February 2, 1425, Bartolomeo Valori and Cosimo de' Medici {{requested}} 400 of the 800florins {{that had}} been deposited with the Calimala, likely for work already completed.

40|$|In this work, {{a survey}} was {{conducted}} to help quantify the relevance of nineteen types <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> (such as SMS) to seven types of digital investigations associated with mobile devices (MD) (such as child pornography). 97 % of the respondents agreed that every type <b>of</b> digital <b>evidence</b> has a different level of relevance to further or solve a particular investigation. From 55 serious participants, a data set of 5, 772 responses regarding the relevance of nineteen types <b>of</b> digital <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> all the seven types of digital investigations was obtained. The results showed that (i) SMS belongs to the most relevant type <b>of</b> digital <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> all the seven types of investigations, (ii) MMS belongs to the most relevant type <b>of</b> digital <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> all the types of digital investigations except espionage and eavesdropping where {{it is the second}} most relevant type <b>of</b> digital <b>evidence,</b> (iii) Phonebook and Contacts is the most relevant type <b>of</b> digital <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> all types <b>of</b> digital investigations except child pornography, (iv) Audio Calls is the most relevant type <b>of</b> digital <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> all types <b>of</b> digital investigations except credit card fraud and child pornography and (v) Standalone Files are the least relevant type <b>of</b> digital <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> most <b>of</b> the digital investigations.

5|$|Periyar {{claimed that}} Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada {{came from the}} same mother {{language}} of Old Tamil. He explained that the Tamil language is called by four different names since it is spoken in four different Dravidian states. Nevertheless, current understanding of Dravidian languages contains statements contradicting such claims. For example, the currently known classification of Dravidian languages provides the following distinct classes: Southern (including Tamil–Kannada (Malayalam) and Tulu); Central (including Telugu–Kui and Kolami–Parji); and, Northern (including Kurukh–Malto and Brahui). Additionally, statements on the presence <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> linking Dravidian languages and Indo-European languages are available.|$|E

5|$|Anning's discoveries became key pieces <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> {{extinction}}. Georges Cuvier {{had argued}} for the reality of extinction in the late 1790s based on his analysis of fossils of mammals such as mammoths. Nevertheless, until the early 1820s it was still believed by many scientifically literate people that just as new species did not appear, so existing ones did not become extinct—in part because they felt that extinction would imply that God's creation had been imperfect; any oddities found were explained away as belonging to animals still living somewhere in an unexplored region of the Earth. Of the bizarre nature of the fossils found by Anning, some, such as the plesiosaur, so unlike any known living creature, struck a major blow against this idea.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{displays}} features {{common to}} both birds and non-avian dinosaurs, Archaeopteryx {{has often been}} considered a link between them. In the 1970s, John Ostrom, following Thomas Henry Huxley's lead in 1868, argued that birds evolved within theropod dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx was a critical piece <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> this argument; it had several avian features, such as a wishbone, flight feathers, wings, and a partially reversed first toe along with dinosaur and theropod features. For instance, it has a long ascending process of the ankle bone, interdental plates, an obturator process of the ischium, and long chevrons in the tail. In particular, Ostrom found that Archaeopteryx was remarkably similar to the theropod family Dromaeosauridae.|$|E
5|$|Many modern {{scholars}} {{question the}} idea that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, seeing the biblical stories not as historical accounts but as symbolic narratives invented to present the birth as fulfillment of prophecy and imply {{a connection to the}} lineage of King David. The Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in Archaeology magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Galilee. In a 2011 article in Biblical Archaeology Review magazine, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position that Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|The Fijian parrotfinch is {{endemic to}} a single country; {{although}} its population is unknown, it is described as uncommon or locally common. In the absence <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> any decline in numbers, its population {{is believed to be}} stable, and it is therefore classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It is protected under Schedule 2 of Fiji's Endangered and Protected Species Act 2002, which regulates the import and trade of species that are not thought to be at a high risk of extinction, but may be threatened if trade in those species is not regulated. In the early 20th century, Europeans in Fiji kept these finches as cagebirds, calling them croton finches because of their liking for the croton bush, but the pet trade appears not to be a significant factor at present.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of research support for each recommendation varies; {{some of the}} more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard to fall asleep. There is a lack <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights.|$|E
5|$|Without seismic data or {{knowledge}} of its moment of inertia, little direct {{information is available}} about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus. The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling {{at about the same}} rate. The slightly smaller size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's. The principal difference between the two planets is the lack <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous. This results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally generated magnetic field.|$|E
