5|$|Although this {{question}} is brought up {{now for the first}} time to be decided by this Court, we consider it as having been long since settled in public <b>opinion.</b> <b>In</b> no other case for many years has this jurisdiction been asserted, and the general acquiescence of legal men shows the prevalence of <b>opinion</b> <b>in</b> favor of the negative of the proposition.|$|E
5|$|Black's {{majority}} <b>opinion</b> <b>in</b> McCollum v. Board of Education (1948) {{held that}} the government could not provide religious instruction in public schools. In Torcaso v. Watkins (1961), he delivered an opinion which affirmed that the states could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office. Similarly, he authored the majority <b>opinion</b> <b>in</b> Engel v. Vitale (1962), which declared it unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools.|$|E
5|$|Both {{cases were}} {{appealed to the}} Kentucky Court of Appealsthen the highest court in Kentuckyin 1823. In the case of Blair, the debt relief {{position}} was argued by George M. Bibb, while the anti-relief position was represented by Robert Wickliffe. In Lapsley, Wickliffe joined George Robertson and Ben Hardin to represent the anti-relief position, while the relief position was argued by John Rowan and William T. Barry. Chief Justice John Boyle wrote the majority <b>opinion</b> <b>in</b> Blair on October 8, 1823, and Associate Justice William Owsley issued the court's <b>opinion</b> <b>in</b> Lapsley three days later. In both cases, the anti-relief position was upheld.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} the first {{empirical}} evidence of fairness <b>opinions</b> <b>in</b> Europe. Legal requirements concerning {{the use of}} fairness <b>opinions</b> <b>in</b> mergers and acquisitions are significantly different in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. We examine the determinants of target fairness <b>opinions</b> <b>in</b> these various regulatory settings and, moreover, investigate the impact of such opinions on abnormal target returns. Whilst in Germany and Austria market participants do not deem fairness opinions important, they do create value for shareholders in Switzerland. Because conflicts of interest between target board and bidder are a main determinant of fairness <b>opinions</b> <b>in</b> Switzerland, we conclude that, when target management faces such conflict, external expert advice replaces the board’s opinion on the offer...|$|R

5|$|Among other effects, the Korean War {{galvanised}} NATO {{to develop}} a military structure. Public <b>opinion</b> <b>in</b> countries involved, such as Great Britain, was divided for and against the war. Many feared an escalation into a general war with Communist China, and even nuclear war. The strong {{opposition to the war}} often strained Anglo-American relations. For these reasons British officials sought a speedy end to the conflict, hoping to unite Korea under United Nations auspices and withdrawal of all foreign forces.|$|E
40|$|Studies in {{pragmatics}} {{have been}} limited {{to a handful of}} illocutionary acts such as requests, apologies or compliments, and <b>opinions</b> remain underrepresented <b>in</b> the existing literature. In this paper I present the results of a study of <b>opinions</b> <b>in</b> Irish English, conducted in an intercultural environment of Irish-Polish interactions. Departing from a traditional approach of speech act realisation studies, I applied the theory of cultural scripts to analyse <b>opinions.</b> <b>In</b> contrasting the Irish and Polish formulas for expressing opinions, as well as sociopragmatic attitudes towards this speech act, a difference in the cultural scripts for <b>opinions</b> <b>in</b> each culture was observable. Apart from already documented Polish frankness <b>in</b> <b>opinions,</b> the study discovered also a rational approach to presenting good arguments to support one’s assertions among the participants. In relation to the Irish script for opinions, the findings are in line with previous classifications of <b>opinions</b> <b>in</b> Australian English, showing a certain level of variational uniformity amongst the English-speaking cultures in this regard...|$|R

5|$|However, Black {{wrote the}} {{majority}} <b>opinion</b> <b>in</b> Korematsu v. United States, which upheld Japanese internment during World War II.

5|$|In December 1523, {{the council}} set a {{deadline}} of Pentecost in 1524 {{for a solution}} to the elimination of the mass and images.

The council decided on the orderly removal of images within Zurich, but rural congregations were granted the right to remove them based on majority vote. The decision on the mass was postponed.|$|E

5|$|A second {{important}} decision in which Owsley was a participant {{was the case}} of Blair, etc. v. Williams, which invalidated the Kentucky Replevin Act of 1820. This law granted debtors a two-year grace period in repaying their debts unless their creditors would accept notes from the Bank of Kentucky. Owsley and his colleagues opined that this law was in violation of the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The decision was extremely unpopular with the Commonwealth's citizens, but it was re-affirmed by the court's <b>opinion</b> <b>in</b> the related case of Lapsley v. Brashcars and Barr.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, the non-Serb {{civilian}} {{population in the}} village and the surrounding area was persecuted. They were forced to flee their homes, as they would have been imprisoned, physically abused or killed if they did not. After the war, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) charged high-ranking SAO SBWS and Serbian officials, including Slobodan Milošević and Goran Hadžić, with war crimes committed in Dalj. The killings were extensively covered by German media leading to forming of a public <b>opinion</b> <b>in</b> support of Croatia. By the end of 1991, Germany adopted support for diplomatic recognition of Croatia as its policy and duty.|$|E
