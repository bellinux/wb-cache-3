5|$|Although {{set in a}} hospital, it uses {{no medical}} storylines; the action is {{produced}} by a series <b>of</b> <b>soap</b> opera-style twists and turns in the personal lives of the characters. They proceed {{through a series of}} often absurd sketch-like scenes, or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up, often emphasizing the body language of the characters. The show had eight writers. Two series were made by the Talkback Thames production company for Channel 4.|$|E
5|$|Eichmann told Brand that {{he wanted}} 10,000 new trucks for the Waffen-SS to use on the Eastern front, one truck for every 100 Jews, as well as 200 tons of tea, 200 tons of cocoa, 800 tons of coffee and 2,000,000 cases <b>of</b> <b>soap.</b> If Brand {{returned}} from Istanbul with confirmation that the Allies had accepted the proposal, Eichmann said he would release 10 percent of the one million. The deal would proceed with 100,000 Jews released for every 1,000 trucks.|$|E
5|$|Nablus has {{a bustling}} modern {{commercial}} center with restaurants, and a shopping mall. Traditional industries {{continue to operate}} in Nablus, such as the production <b>of</b> <b>soap,</b> olive oil, and handicrafts. Other industries include furniture production, tile production, stone quarrying, textile manufacturing and leather tanning. The city is also a regional trading center for live produce. Most of these industries are centered in the old city.|$|E

5|$|Runcorn was a small, {{isolated}} village {{until the}} Industrial Revolution. It was a health {{resort in the}} late 18th and early 19th centuries. Towards {{the end of the}} 18th century, a port began to develop on the south bank of the River Mersey. During the 19th century, industries developed the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>soap</b> and alkali, quarrying, shipbuilding, engineering, and tanning. In the early 20th century, the prime industries were chemicals and tanning. The original village has grown to include what were outlying villages.|$|E
5|$|Waitress Shelley Johnson (Mädchen Amick) {{is about}} to leave for work when her abusive husband Leo (Eric Da Re) demands she do more laundry. She finds a bloodstained shirt among Leo's clothes and hides it before he notices. However, he later realizes that it has gone missing. When she returns home that night, he {{questions}} her about its whereabouts, and savagely beats her with a bar <b>of</b> <b>soap</b> in a sock.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} studied {{variation of}} the problem involves networks of interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where three {{or more of the}} curves meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam <b>of</b> <b>soap</b> bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, and there may be {{more than one way to}} continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E
25|$|Removal of {{microorganisms}} from skin {{is enhanced by}} the addition <b>of</b> <b>soaps</b> or detergents to water. The main action <b>of</b> <b>soaps</b> and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution, and increase solubility. Water is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, are not readily dissolved in water. Cleansing is, however, aided by a reasonable flow of water.|$|R

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to get Chris into Morningwood Academy, Peter is forced by Carter Pewterschmidt to appear in a remake of the 1997 comedy film Liar Liar. After Chris is {{accepted}} to Morningwood Academy, he is asleep in his bed for the night, and is suddenly attacked by a group of classmates, who stuff wads of dollar bills into their socks, and quickly begin beating him with the weapons. This scene is a parody of that of the infamous sequence shown in director Stanley Kubrick's 1987 war film Full Metal Jacket, in which the Marine recruits take turns striking Private Pyle with bars <b>of</b> <b>soap</b> wrapped in towels as punishment for frequently getting them in trouble.|$|E
5|$|Nabulsi soap or sabon nabulsi {{is a type}} of castile soap {{produced}} only in Nablus and made of three primary ingredients: virgin olive oil, water, and a sodium compound. Since the 10th century, Nabulsi soap has enjoyed a reputation for being a fine product, and has been exported across the Arab world and to Europe. Though the number <b>of</b> <b>soap</b> factories decreased from a peak of thirty in the 19th century to only two today, efforts to preserve this important part of Palestinian and Nabulsi cultural heritage continue.|$|E
5|$|A foam is {{a mass of}} bubbles; foams of {{different}} materials occur in nature. Foams composed <b>of</b> <b>soap</b> films obey Plateau's laws, which require three soap films to meet at each edge at 120° and four soap edges to meet at each vertex at the tetrahedral angle of about 109.5°. Plateau's laws further require films to be smooth and continuous, {{and to have a}} constant average curvature at every point. For example, a film may remain nearly flat on average by being curved up in one direction (say, left to right) while being curved downwards in another direction (say, front to back). Structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents. Lord Kelvin identified the problem of {{the most efficient way to}} pack cells of equal volume as a foam in 1887; his solution uses just one solid, the bitruncated cubic honeycomb with very slightly curved faces to meet Plateau's laws. No better solution was found until 1993 when Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the Weaire–Phelan structure; the Beijing National Aquatics Center adapted the structure for their outer wall in the 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|E
50|$|The {{salting out}} process {{used in the}} {{manufacture}} <b>of</b> <b>soaps</b> benefits from the common ion effect. Soaps are sodium salts of fatty acids. Addition of sodium chloride reduces the solubility <b>of</b> the <b>soap</b> salts. The soaps precipitate due {{to a combination of}} common ion effect and increased ionic strength.|$|R

25|$|The {{character}} of Phil is arguably one <b>of</b> the <b>soap's</b> most popular, particularly with female viewers, making him one <b>of</b> the <b>soap's</b> unlikeliest sex symbols. He has featured {{in some of}} the show's most memorable and highly viewed storylines and he is the second longest running male character to appear in the soap, surpassed only by Ian Beale. Phil along with Grant was voted as the second most popular King <b>Of</b> <b>Soaps</b> in a Channel 4 poll in 2002.|$|R
5|$|At age six, Rainilaiarivony began {{two years}} of study {{at one of the}} new schools opened by the London Missionary Society (LMS) for the {{children}} of the noble class at the royal palace in Antananarivo. Ranavalona shut down the mission schools in 1836, but the boy continued to study privately with an older missionary student. When Rainilaiarivony reached age 11 or 12, the relatives who had raised him decided he was old enough to make his own way in the world. Beginning with the purchase and resale of a few bars <b>of</b> <b>soap,</b> the boy gradually grew his business and expanded into the more profitable resale of fabric. The young Rainilaiarivony's reputation for tenacity and industriousness, as he fought against his predestined misfortunes, eventually reached the palace, where at the age of 14 the boy was invited to meet Queen Ranavalona I. She was favorably impressed, awarding him the official ranking of Sixth Honor title of Officer of the Palace. At 16 he was promoted to Seventh Honor, then promoted twice again to Eighth and Ninth Honor at age 19, an unprecedented ascent through the ranks.|$|E
5|$|The White House is {{the oldest}} {{building}} on President's Park. An {{integral part of the}} planned city that is Washington, D.C., a design was chosen and construction begun in 1792, and the building (although unfinished) was opened for occupancy on November 1, 1800. The first people to occupy the building were President John Adams and his wife, Abigail. Parts of the mansion were unfinished, including the cavernous East Room. With no running water (it was not installed until 1834), water had to be brought into the house by jug and heated for bathing or laundry to be done. Abigail Adams often hung the family's laundry up to dry in the drafty East Room. The ghost of Abigail Adams has been seen since shortly after her death in 1818, arms extended as if she were still carrying laundry into the East Room, accompanied by the smell <b>of</b> <b>soap</b> or damp clothing. Household staff in the Taft administration even observed her walking through walls.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 15th century, the {{governor}} of Tripoli (Lebanon) Youssef Bek Sayfa established Khan Al Saboun (the hotel <b>of</b> <b>soap</b> traders). This market was finished {{at the beginning of the}} 16th century, the last days of the Mamlouks ruling. The manufacture <b>of</b> <b>soap</b> was very popular in Tripoli. There, the market became a trade center where soap was produced and sold. Afterwards, traders of Tripoli began to export their soap to Europe.|$|E
40|$|Five {{different}} types <b>of</b> liquid <b>soap</b> were studied in hospital wards, each during two months' use. Altogether 1306 finger print samples {{were taken from}} the hands of the staff by sampling twice a week and the acceptability <b>of</b> the <b>soaps</b> was measured by a questionnaire. During the use <b>of</b> different <b>soaps</b> only slight differences were found in the numbers of total bacteria or in the occurrence of Staph. aureus and gram-negative bacilli on the hands. During the use of the emulsion-type product studied, several persons who had dermatological problems had lower mean bacterial counts of the fingers than during the use <b>of</b> the other <b>soaps.</b> This soap was also favourably accepted by the staff. After over one year's use <b>of</b> pine oil <b>soap</b> and alcohol, the staff of the hospital was satisfied with the method. However, several persons with skin problems admitted to not using soap or alcohol. The considerable differences found in the acceptability <b>of</b> <b>soaps</b> imply that for use in hospital the choice <b>of</b> a <b>soap</b> acceptable to the nursing staff is important in promoting proper hand hygiene...|$|R

5000|$|Unsaponifiables are {{components}} of an oily (oil, fat, wax) mixture {{that fail to}} form soaps when blended with sodium hydroxide (lye) or potassium hydroxide. [...] Since saponifiable {{components of}} the original oil mixture do form <b>soaps,</b> the result <b>of</b> a <b>soap</b> making procedure is a mixture <b>of</b> <b>soaps</b> and other, frequently oily, materials.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to slogans the Blackwell Company used promotions to increase sales of Bull Durham Tobacco. One promotion Blackwell ran gave soap to the merchants that sold their product. The company offered a bar <b>of</b> <b>soap</b> for each pound of tobacco a salesman purchased or 30 bars <b>of</b> <b>soap</b> for every 25 pounds purchased. Merchants could offer promotions {{in their own}} store, sell the soap, or use the soap themselves. Salesmen bought Bull Durham in bulk in order to reap the rewards of the soap, in turn increasing the total sales of Bull Durham.|$|E
