5|$|Many of {{the iconic}} {{aspects of a}} typical James Bond film were {{established}} in Dr. No: the film begins with {{an introduction to the}} character through the view of a gun barrel and a highly stylised main title sequence, both created by Maurice Binder. Production designer Ken Adam established an elaborate visual style that is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> the film series.|$|E

5|$|Written over {{a period}} of several years and {{influenced}} by European literature, Siti Akbari differs from earlier syairs in its use of suspense and emphasis on prose rather than form. It also incorporates European realist views to expand upon the genre, although it maintains several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> traditional syairs. Critical views have emphasised various aspects of its story, finding in the work an increased empathy for women's thoughts and feelings, a call for a unifying language in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), and a polemic regarding the relation between tradition and modernity.|$|E

50|$|Wingfield cites other jazz, rock, Indian, Japanese, African and {{classical}} music as influences, {{and as a}} composer, has written over 70 compositions. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> both his guitar playing and his composing, is that these influences are fused with western classical music, and integrated into a distinctive musical voice.His compositions blend lyrical melodies with a distinctive harmonic palette and sometimes complex rhythmic components.|$|R
5|$|Evidence of {{abstract}} thinking {{can be seen}} in the archaeological record as early as the Acheulean-Middle Stone Age transition, approximately 300,000-250,000 years ago. This transition involves a shift in stone tool technology from Mode 2, Acheulean tools, to Mode 3 and 4, which include blades and microliths. The manufacture of these tools requires planning and the understanding of how striking a stone will produce different flaking patterns. This requires abstract thought, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> modern human behavior. The shift from large cutting tools in the Acheulian to smaller and more diversified toolkits in the MSA represents a better cognitive and conceptual understanding of flintknapping, as well as the potential functional effects of distinct tool types.|$|E
25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> Persian gardens is the four-part garden {{laid out}} with axial paths that {{intersect}} at the garden's centre. This highly structured geometrical scheme, called the chahar bagh, became a powerful {{metaphor for the}} organization and domestication of the landscape, itself a symbol of political territory.|$|E
25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> China's {{socialist economy}} was its promise of {{employment}} to all able {{and willing to}} work and job-security with virtually lifelong tenure. Reformers targeted the labor market as unproductive because industries were frequently overstaffed to fulfill socialist goals and job-security reduced workers' incentive to work. This socialist policy was pejoratively called the iron rice bowl.|$|E

25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the BMAC were sedentary people who practised irrigation farming of wheat and barley. With their impressive material culture including monumental architecture, bronze tools, ceramics, and jewellery of semiprecious stones, the complex exhibits many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> civilisation.

Concentrations of benzodiazepines detected in impaired motor vehicle drivers often exceeding therapeutic doses have been reported in Sweden and in Northern Ireland. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> problematic benzodiazepine drug misuse is escalation of dose.

25|$|Go-go is {{a popular}} music subgenre {{associated}} with funk that originated in the Washington, D.C., area during the mid-60s to late-70s.

25|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{origin of}} theory of mind remains obscure. While many theories make claims about {{its role in}} the development of human language and social cognition few of them specify in detail any evolutionary neurophysiological precursors. A recent theory claims that ToM has its roots in two defensive reactions, namely immobilization stress and tonic immobility, which are implicated in the handling of stressful encounters and also figure prominently in mammalian childrearing practices (Tsoukalas, 2017). Their combined effect seems capable of producing many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> theory of mind, e.g., eye-contact, gaze-following, inhibitory control and intentional attributions.|$|E
25|$|Mississippian culture pottery is {{the ceramic}} {{tradition}} of the Mississippian culture (800 to 1600 CE) found as artifacts in archaeological sites in the American Midwest and Southeast. It is often characterized by the adoption and use of riverine (or more rarely marine) shell-tempering agents in the clay paste. Shell tempering is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> Mississippian cultural practices. Local differences in materials, techniques, forms, and designs {{are some of the}} major ways archaeologists understand lifeways, religious practices, trade, and interaction among Mississippian peoples. The value of this pottery on the illegal antiquities market has led to extensive looting of sites.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide is also {{involved}} in the clearance of amyloid-β peptide. Amyloid-β peptides are one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> Alzheimer's disease. When they are not degraded properly, these peptides accumulate and create plaques, which are clumps of amyloid-β peptide pieces, and they are highly associated with Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-β peptide clearance is important so that this accumulation does not occur. Sulfatide facilitates amyloid-β peptide removal through an endocytotic pathway, so when there are high levels of sulfatide, there are lower amounts of amyloid-β peptides. Since subjects with Alzheimer's disease have lower sulfatide levels, the clearance of amyloid-β peptides is lower, which allows the peptides to accumulate and create plaques in the brain.|$|E

25|$|The French championships {{were not}} held again until 1920, but Wimbledon resumed in 1919 and Lenglen debuted {{in the tournament}} – her first on grass – meeting seven-time winner Dorothea Douglass Chambers in the final. The match, which became one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> tennis history, was played before 8,000 spectators, {{including}} King George V and Queen Mary. After splitting the first two sets, Lenglen took a 4–1 lead in the final set before Chambers rallied to take a 6–5 (40–15) lead. Lenglen saved the first match point when her service return trickled off the wood of her racket and dropped over the net. Lenglen survived the second match point when Chambers hit a drop shot into the net. Lenglen {{then went on to}} win the match 10–8, 4–6, 9–7.|$|E
25|$|When Yeo {{arrived at}} the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in 2001, he found that fewer than 20% of PhD holders in A*STAR's institutes were Singaporean, and few among them were young scientists. Yeo {{immediately}} set up his boldest scholarship yet by setting up the A*STAR Graduate Academy to implement the plan to train up 1,000 PhD scholars that would eventually return to Singapore and undertake research in fields like information technology, engineering, molecular biology, biochemistry and medicine. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> Yeo's personal style {{is the amount of}} personal attention he gives to his scholars.

25|$|Beginning with Life on Earth in 1979, Attenborough {{set about}} {{creating}} {{a body of work}} which became a benchmark of quality in wildlife film-making and influenced a generation of documentary film-makers. The series also established many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> the BBC's natural history output. By treating his subject seriously and researching the latest discoveries, Attenborough and his production team gained the trust of scientists, who responded by allowing him to feature their subjects in his programmes. In Rwanda, for example, Attenborough and his crew were granted privileged access to film Dian Fossey's research group of mountain gorillas. Innovation was another factor in Life on Earths success: new film-making techniques were devised to get the shots Attenborough wanted, with a focus on events and animals that were hitherto unfilmed. Computerised airline schedules, which had only recently been introduced, enabled the series to be elaborately devised so that Attenborough visited several locations around the globe in each episode, sometimes even changing continents mid-sentence. Although appearing as the on-screen presenter, he consciously restricted his time on camera to give his subjects top billing.|$|E
