5|$|Formerly, {{the pope}} {{would later be}} crowned by the triregnum <b>or</b> <b>Triple</b> Tiara at the Papal Coronation. All popes since John Paul I have refused an {{elaborate}} coronation, choosing instead to have a simpler papal inauguration ceremony.|$|E
5|$|One {{exception}} in this rule {{occurs when the}} defense makes at least one out and attempts to complete a double play <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> play. An error is not charged in that situation if a wild throw allows the runner to reach safely. If a wild throw allows the runner to advance an additional base, an error may then be charged for the additional advance. However, if an accurate throw is made in time to complete a double play <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> play, but the fielder on the base fails to make the catch, an error may be charged.|$|E
5|$|High {{altitude}} sections {{subject to}} {{snow and ice}} have yellow lane markings and red reflector posts (which are sometimes double <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> height); {{in contrast to the}} white lines and posts generally seen elsewhere around Australia. It is recommended that snow chains are carried for all two-wheel drive vehicles travelling on this highway within Kosciuszko National Park during the winter months.|$|E

5000|$|The lowest {{possible}} score for a bingo is 56. This {{is achieved by}} making an 8-letter word with six one-point tiles and two blanks, or by making a 7-letter word with one blank and a two-letter word with both blanks. The word must not be doubled <b>or</b> <b>tripled,</b> and no one-point tile may be doubled <b>or</b> <b>tripled.</b> A 55-point bingo is theoretically possible in tournament play, by making a two-blank play on an empty board that misses the center star.|$|R
25|$|RDF is an {{abstract}} model with several serialization formats (i.e. file formats), so the particular encoding for resources <b>or</b> <b>triples</b> varies from format to format.|$|R
5|$|The {{calls of}} the two species are not similar. The call of the greater melampitta is a double <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> note, which is slurred and {{repeated}} monotonously, and {{is reminiscent of the}} black pitohui. The call of the lesser melampitta are either harsh buzzy notes or chirped whistles, both of which are repeated at intervals.|$|E
5|$|There are two new battle mechanics: Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. In Triple Battles, {{both teams}} must send out three Pokémon {{in a row}} at once; Pokémon on {{the left or right}} side can only attack the opponent's Pokémon on the same side or in the center. Changing {{position}} takes up one turn. In Rotation Battles, each side sends out three Pokémon at once, but they are arranged in a circle that can be rotated at will. Black has more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and the opposite is true in White. Another introduction is Combination Moves: a starter Pokémon can be taught one of three moves, and using them together in Double <b>or</b> <b>Triple</b> battles produces more powerful attacks. In the wild, walking through different-colored tall grass can trigger Double Battles against wild Pokémon rather than only Single Battles as usual.|$|E
5|$|Wilt Chamberlain {{received}} {{criticism for}} {{his inability to}} win lead Kansas to a win in the National Championship game; Chamberlain later admitted that this loss was the most painful in his life. He returned to Kansas for his junior year and to play another season under coach Dick Harp. Chamberlain quickly became frustrated with the opposing teams' way of playing him, which primarily consisted of double <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> teaming Chamberlain in order to limit his offensive production and effectiveness. In addition, many teams resorted to running out {{the time on the}} clock when in the lead against the Jayhawks to increase their odds of winning the game. After the Jayhawks failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament that year, Chamberlain decided to forgo his senior season to play with the Harlem Globetrotters. He did not return to Kansas' campus for over 40 years after leaving for the Globetrotters; he finally returned in 1998, the year before his death, when his jersey was retired.|$|E

Some local special event races are double <b>or</b> even <b>triple</b> point races, doubling <b>or</b> <b>tripling</b> the points each {{position in the}} Mains each racer would normally get. points are awarded, so an Expert winner could look forward to collecting 400 points for winning his class in addition to bonus points and participant points.|$|R

5|$|The 14th century Huolongjing {{was also}} one of the first Chinese texts to {{carefully}} describe to the use of explosive land mines, which had been used by the late Song Chinese against the Mongols in 1277, and employed by the Yuan dynasty afterwards. The innovation of the detonated land mine was accredited to one Luo Qianxia in the campaign of defense against the Mongol invasion by Kublai Khan, Later Chinese texts revealed that the Chinese land mine employed either a rip cord or a motion booby trap of a pin releasing falling weights that rotated a steel flint wheel, which in turn created sparks that ignited the train of fuses for the land mines. Furthermore, the Song employed the earliest known gunpowder-propelled rockets in warfare during the late 13th century, its earliest form being the archaic Fire Arrow. When the Northern Song capital of Kaifeng fell to the Jurchens in 1126, it was written by Xia Shaozeng that 20,000 fire arrows were handed over to the Jurchens in their conquest. An even earlier Chinese text of the Wujing Zongyao ("Collection of the Most Important Military Techniques"), written in 1044 by the Song scholars Zeng Kongliang and Yang Weide, described the use of three spring <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> bow arcuballista that fired arrow bolts holding gunpowder packets near the head of the arrow. Going back yet even farther, the Wu Li Xiao Shi (1630, second edition 1664) of Fang Yizhi stated that fire arrows were presented to Emperor Taizu of Song (r. 960–976) in 960.|$|E

25|$|Less {{common is}} the use of a double <b>or</b> <b>triple</b> {{chainring}} in conjunction with an internally geared hub, extending the gear range without having to fit multiple sprockets to the hub. However, this does require a chain tensioner of some sort, negating some of the advantages of hub gears.|$|E

50|$|As well as {{relieving}} the shearer's hand of {{the cutting}} effort, the machine clips the wool at its full length, which often doubles <b>or</b> <b>triples</b> its value. It also removes the wool in a fleece instead of chopping it into small pieces like the shears.|$|R
