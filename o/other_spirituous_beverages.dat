50|$|The {{international}} trade of grapes, wine and <b>spirituous</b> <b>beverages</b> continues to grow. The share of export volumes of wine has developed significantly {{over the past}} decade: at over 100 million hectolitres, it is equivalent to 43% of world consumption, compared with 25% 10 years ago. Every two bottles out of five consumed {{in the world are}} imported.|$|R

40|$|Classification of Venezuelan <b>spirituous</b> <b>beverages</b> {{by means}} of {{discriminant}} analysis and artificial neural networks based on their Zn, Cu and Fe concentrations (Hernández C., Edwin A.; Ávila G., Rita M.; Capote, Tarcisio; Rivas E., Francklin I.; Pérez M., Anna G.) Abstract Copper, zinc and iron concentrations were determined in ''aguardiente de Cocuy de Penca'' (Cocuy de Penca firewater), a <b>spirituous</b> <b>beverage</b> very popular in the North-Western region of Venezuela, by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). These elements were selected for their presence {{can be traced to}} the (illegal) manufacturing process of the aforementioned beverages. Linear and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained with the backpropagation algorithm were employed for estimating if such beverages can be distinguished based on the concentrations of these elements in the final product, and whether it is possible to assess the geographic location of the manufacturers (Lara or Falco´n states) and the presence or absence of sugar in the end product. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) performed poorly, overall estimation and prediction rates being 51. 7 % and 50. 0 %, respectively. A QDA showed a slightly better overall performance, yet unsatisfactory (estimation: 79. 2 %, prediction: 72. 5 %). Various ANNs, comprising a linear function (L) in the input layer, a sigmoid function (S) in the hidden layer(s) and a hyperbolic tangent function (T) in the output layer, were evaluated. Of the networks studied, the (3 L: 5 S: 7 S: 4 T) gave the highest estimation (overall: 96. 5 %) and prediction rates (overall: 97. 0 %), demonstrating the superb performance of ANNs for classification purposes.

50|$|According to the Shafi'i {{school of}} Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, as systematised by Al-Nawawi {{in his book}} Minhadj, the {{following}} things are najis: wine and <b>other</b> <b>spirituous</b> drinks, dogs, swine, dead animals that were not ritually slaughtered, blood, excrements, and the milk of animals whose meat Muslims {{are not allowed to}} eat. Spirituous drinks are not impure according to the Hanafi school, while living swine and dogs are not impure according to the Malikis.|$|R
50|$|The {{legislature}} {{acted upon}} {{a number of}} the Governor's requests. A new election law banned any candidate for office from asking another person to consume beer or <b>other</b> <b>spirituous</b> liquors. Counties were instructed to provide food, lodging, and medical assistance to indigent persons. The most influential act came when the legislature combined the functions of oversight boards for territorial prison, reform school and insane asylum into a Board of Territorial Control. A county level office of commissioner of agriculture was also created.|$|R
2500|$|Hales {{was one of}} the co-founders of the Royal Society of Arts {{conceived}} by William Shipley. Hales was also active in the movement to promote the Gin Act 1736. He wrote a number of anonymous tracts against the consumption of gin and distilled spirits, most notably 'A Friendly Admonition to the Drinker of Brandy and <b>other</b> Distilled <b>Spirituous</b> Liquors'. [...] and also lobbied Parliament. Hales was not opposed to all alcoholic beverages but felt strongly that spirits, and gin in particular, were as he termed it 'The Bane of the Nation'.|$|R
6000|$|It {{is painful}} to {{be obliged to}} record the {{weaknesses}} of fathers, {{but it must be}} furthermore told of Costigan, that when his credit was exhausted and his money gone, he would not unfrequently beg money from his daughter, and made statements to her not altogether consistent with strict truth. On one day a bailiff was about to lead him to prison, he wrote, [...] "unless the--to you insignificant--sum of three pound five can be forthcoming to liberate a poor man's grey hairs from gaol." [...] And the good-natured Lady Mirabel despatched the money necessary for her father's liberation, with a caution to him to be more economical for the future. On a second occasion the Captain met with a frightful accident, and broke a plate-glass window in the Strand, for which the proprietor of the shop held him liable. The money was forthcoming on this time too, to repair her papa's disaster, and was carried down by Lady Mirabel's servant to the slipshod messenger and aide-de-camp of the Captain, who brought the letter announcing his mishap. If the servant had followed the Captain's aide-de-camp who carried the remittance, he would have seen that gentleman, a person of Costigan's country too (for have we not said, that however poor an Irish gentleman is, he always has a poorer Irish gentleman to run on his errands and transact his pecuniary affairs?), call a cab from the nearest stand, and rattle down to the Roscius Head, Harlequin Yard, Drury Lane, where the Captain was indeed in pawn, and for several glasses containing rum-and-water, or <b>other</b> <b>spirituous</b> refreshment, of which he and his staff had partaken. On a third melancholy occasion he wrote that he was attacked by illness, and wanted money to pay the physician whom he was compelled to call in; and this time Lady Mirabel, alarmed about her father's safety, and perhaps reproaching herself that she had of late lost sight of her father, called for her carriage and drove to Shepherd's Inn, at the gate of which she alighted, whence she found the way to her father's chambers, [...] "No. 4, third floor, name of Podmore over the door," [...] the porteress said, with many curtsies, pointing towards the door of the house, into which the affectionate daughter entered and mounted the dingy stair. Alas! the door, surmounted by the name of Podmore, was opened to her by poor Cos in his shirt-sleeves, and prepared with the gridiron to receive the mutton-chops which Mrs. Bolton had gone to purchase.|$|R
40|$|HC Blake clarifies store-closing {{order to}} {{identify}} which stores can remain open and which should be closed. He ordered saloons and hotel bars to be open no earlier than 9 : 30 am and closed no later than 4 : 30 pm. Dentists are also required to wear gauze masks while operating on patients. The race track will also be closed indefinitely. No orders were issued to close saloons and churches in the counties. Each county board of health should decide. There is news that the disease was letting up in South Baltimore. Although {{the number of deaths}} did not decrease in the city, there were fewer registered cases. 100 deaths in the city, same as on Thursday. 1721 new cases, compared to 2000 the previous day. Between 7 : 00 am and 3 : 00 PM, 127 new cases were reported. 50 deaths at Camp Meade. 94 new cases of flu and 167 of pneumonia were reported at Camp Meade to a total of 525 deaths and 11000 cases {{since the beginning of the}} epidemic. 12 deaths and 30 new cases at Edgewood; 1 death and 48 new cases at Aberdeen. 5 deaths and 20 new cases at Fort McHenry. 1 death and 20 new cases at the Marine Hospital. The State Department of Health reported 754 new cases in the counties. The fire department warns about the shortage of firemen and the risk of fires. Wholesale businesses not affected by order from HC Blake. Dr. Blake states: "I want to say that I expect hearty co-operation on the saloon people and the proprietors of hotels and all <b>other</b> places where <b>spirituous</b> and malt liquors are sold at retail and to be drunk on the premises. Otherwise, I shall have to take more drastic action regarding them". He reminds that these orders have the power of laws and will be enforced. The order about store hours was lightly modified to exempt dairies, groceries, drug stores, cigar stores, confectionaries, barber shops, bootblacking establishments and dairy lunchrooms. Also businesses in the outlying areas may be kept open as well. Dental association endorses use of gauze masks while performing oral procedures. At Camp Meade, there was a slight increase in the number of cases of flu and a big increase in the cases of pneumonia, with 50 deaths reported. There have been 525 deaths at the camp. 94 new cases of the disease. Quarantine at Saunder's Range is reportedly to keep soldiers from coming to the city, but there are no cases of flu at the camp at the moment. Fort McHenry reports 5 dead, 25 new cases, and 75 discharges. Edgewood reported 3 deaths, 25 new cases, 60 patients were discharged leaving 400 with the disease. Those wanting to learn more about the disease can go to the office of Dr. James A. Nydeggar, of the US Health Service, to obtain a four-page pamphlet on how to prevent catching the disease. 'These small books will be given free to any manufacturing concern department store or large office desiring them'. Dr. Nydeggar will post several thousand circulars around the city and send them to the counties, particularly to school teachers. Newspaper article 14,...|$|R
