5|$|A church {{close to}} the {{refinery}} {{was used as a}} point for families seeking information on relatives employed at the facility. So many people turned up that police requested that each family send only one representative. At the close of the day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> six people were missing, with no confirmed deaths. Overnight, several deep-seated fires were uncovered and firefighting continued the next day.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosions</b> was not {{immediately}} known, but an investigation concluded in February 2016 that an overheated container of dry nitrocellulose was <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>explosion.</b>|$|R

5|$|A ten-member {{team led}} by Leonard Reiffel was {{assembled}} at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago to study the potential visibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> benefits to science, and implications for the lunar surface. Among {{the members of the}} research team were astronomer Gerard Kuiper and his doctoral student Carl Sagan, who was responsible for the mathematical projection of the expansion of a dust cloud in space around the Moon, an essential element in determining its visibility from Earth.|$|E
5|$|All three {{ships were}} {{fitted with a}} shallow anti-torpedo bulge {{integral}} to the hull which was intended to explode the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and vent the underwater explosion to the surface rather than into the ship. However, later testing proved {{that it was not}} deep enough to accomplish its task as it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b>|$|E
5|$|An initial {{progress}} {{report by the}} Major Incident Investigation Board on 21 February 2006 did not go into the causes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> but summed up the event and the immediate reaction from the emergency services. A second {{progress report}}, published on 11April 2006, looked at the environmental impact.|$|E

50|$|The Ontario Fire Marshal's Office handled <b>the</b> {{investigation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosions.</b> While <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosions</b> has not {{yet been}} determined, on August 21, 2008, Ontario's independent safety regulator for fuels, the Technical Standards and Safety Authority, released a statement saying that just before <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> a truck driver was illegally transferring propane from one truck to another. The agency also reported that in November 2006, Sunrise Propane was warned about its lack of safety by not stopping the truck-to-truck transfers at the company's facilities, and that truck-to-truck transfers were a frequent and routine operating practice at the facility. An investigator with the Ontario Fire Marshal's Office stated that it could take months before <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosions</b> could be determined. Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty also said that the province was willing to provide financial aid to residents whose homes were damaged by <b>the</b> <b>explosions.</b>|$|R
5|$|At 3:00a.m., the paramilitaries {{demolished}} the Roman Catholic {{church of}} the Pilgrimage to the Blessed Virgin Mary in Voćin. They used the 550-year-old structure as an ammunition depot. In the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> a single wall of the structure remained standing. It is estimated that several tons of explosives {{were used for the}} purpose. At the same time, approximately 20 other Croat inhabitants of villages of Bokane, Krašković, Miokovićevo and Zvečevo, further to the south, were reportedly killed.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{his work}} for the 60 Minutes reports plus further {{investigation}} on his own, Thompson wrote A Glimpse of Hell. The book was published by W. W. Norton & Company. Thompson's book was extremely critical {{of most of the}} Navy personnel involved in the investigation, concluding that the Navy had orchestrated a cover-up to conceal the true cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Computer {{models have}} been very {{successful}} at calculating the behavior of TypeII supernovae when the shock has been formed. By ignoring the first second <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> and assuming that an explosion is started, astrophysicists {{have been able to}} make detailed predictions about the elements produced by the supernova and of the expected light curve from the supernova.|$|E

50|$|On 5 February 2016, the Chinese {{government}} issued <b>the</b> {{investigation report}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosions.</b> <b>The</b> report concluded {{the fire started}} in a container through auto-ignition of nitrocellulose, due to vaporization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wetting agent during hot weather.|$|R
50|$|In rejecting {{these claims}} the {{prosecution}} pointed to <b>the</b> apparent lack <b>of</b> planning for <b>the</b> aftermath <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosions.</b> <b>The</b> attempted bombers did not contact media organisations, and dispersed by various routes that showed no prior planning.|$|R
5|$|In 1981 a {{memorial}} {{to the men who}} died in the disaster was unveiled by the National Coal Board, followed by a second in 2006, to honour the dead of both the 1901 and 1913 explosions. In October 2013, on the centenary of the tragedy, a Welsh national memorial to those killed in all Wales's mining disasters was unveiled at the former pithead, depicting a rescue worker coming to the aid of one of the survivors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the wounds}} inflicted by the blast were {{permanently}} debilitating, {{such as those}} caused by flying glass or by the flash <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b> Thousands of people had stopped to watch the ship burning in the harbour, many from inside buildings, leaving them directly {{in the path of}} glass fragments from shattered windows. Roughly 5,900 eye injuries were reported, and 41 people lost their sight permanently.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people in}} Halifax at first {{believed}} the explosion {{to be the}} result of a German attack. The Halifax Herald continued to propagate this belief for some time, for example reporting that Germans had mocked victims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b> While John Johansen, the Norwegian helmsman of Imo, was being treated for serious injuries sustained during the explosion, it was reported to the military police that he had been behaving suspiciously. Johansen was arrested on suspicions of being a German spy when a search turned up a letter on his person, supposedly written in German. It turned out that the letter was actually written in Norwegian. Immediately following the explosion, most of the German survivors in Halifax had been rounded up and imprisoned. Eventually the fear dissipated as the real cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> became known, although rumours of German involvement persisted.|$|E

5|$|The {{emergency}} services announced a major emergency at 06:08 and a fire fighting effort began. The cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> was a fuel-air explosion in a vapour cloud of evaporated leaking fuel.

5|$|The provincial {{judiciary}} {{launched an}} investigation into the cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b> Primary suspects were Litoral Gas (the natural-gas provider for Rosario) and an employee who carried out maintenance work at the building that day. Several public figures sent condolences, and most of the candidates for the 2013 primary elections suspended their political campaigns.|$|E
5|$|The {{refinery}} {{was large}} and old, featuring outdated construction methods, and these factors {{are believed to have}} contributed to the fire's severity. The origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> has been narrowed down {{to the center of the}} factory. It was believed to have occurred in a basement beneath storage silos. Investigations conducted by the Department of Justice ruled out deliberate criminal activity in 2013.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} inquiry held {{jointly by}} the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Environment Agency was started, but calls for a full public inquiry were declined. The Board included Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree; Prof Dougal Drysdale, an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a medical expert. Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its aim was to identify the immediate causes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> rather than consider who was to blame for any deficiencies, {{so as not to}} prejudice further legal proceedings.|$|E
