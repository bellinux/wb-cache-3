40|$|Cytokines {{produced}} by {{cells of the}} immune system, including macrophages, can influence inflammatory responses to viral infection. This has been exploited by viruses, which have developed strategies to direct the immune response towards ineffective responses. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a double-stranded DNA virus that infects macrophages <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>swine.</b> In this study, primary cells of monocyte macrophage lineage {{were obtained from the}} lungs, peritoneum or blood <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>swine</b> and, after infection with ASFV, supernatants were tested for cytokines using biological assays. The cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was detected after infection of macrophage preparations, but tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) were not detected. ASFV-infected and uninfected macrophage populations were also tested to assess their ability to respond to cytokines by enhancing production of superoxide in the respiratory burst mechanism. Responses to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were suppressed in macrophage populations infected with virus, even at low multiplicities of infection. Addition of TGF-beta to uninfected macrophages resulted in a similar suppression of response, but antibody to TGF-beta did not prevent suppression induced by virus.

40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in feral swine are limited, and data for {{clinical}} manifestations and disease transmissibility are lacking. In this report, feral and <b>domestic</b> <b>swine</b> were experimentally infected with FMDV (A 24 -Cruzeiro), and susceptibility and virus transmission were studied. Feral swine were {{proved to be}} highly susceptible to A- 24 Cruzeiro FMD virus by intradermal inoculation and by contact with infected <b>domestic</b> and feral <b>swine.</b> Typical clinical signs in feral swine included transient fever, lameness and vesicular lesions in the coronary bands, heel bulbs, tip of the tongue and snout. <b>Domestic</b> <b>swine</b> exhibited clinical signs of the disease within 24 h after contact with feral swine, whereas feral swine did not show clinical signs of FMD until 48 h after contact with infected <b>domestic</b> and feral <b>swine.</b> Clinical scores <b>of</b> feral and <b>domestic</b> <b>swine</b> were comparable. However, feral swine exhibited a higher tolerance for the disease, and their thicker, darker skin made vesicular lesions difficult to detect. Virus titration of oral swabs showed that both feral and <b>domestic</b> <b>swine</b> shed similar amounts of virus, with levels peaking between 2 to 4 dpi/dpc (days post-inoculation/days post-contact). FMDV RNA was intermittently detectable in the oral swabs by real-time RT-PCR of both feral and <b>domestic</b> <b>swine</b> between 1 and 8 dpi/dpc {{and in some instances}} until 14 dpi/ 12 dpc.

The estimation of genetic parameters for this discrete and strongly leptokurtic trait presents difficulties similar to those encountered in dichotomous ones, and several specific methods of estimation have been suggested, generally assuming the existence of an underlying normally distributed random variable. Heritability estimates of teat number, based on 30 271 animals of three strains of Iberian pig, have been obtained both using conventional correlation and regression methods and through 3 specific techniques proposed by RosExTSOrr, GI AN OLA and TALL IS. These methods allow one to estimate what proportion of the heritability of the assumed underlying variable (h 2) can be accounted for by the heritability estimated in the observed scale (h!). The estimated proportion ranged between 0. 30 and 0. 75 depending on the degree of canalization of the trait in the 3 different populations considered.

40|$|Wildlife immune {{genes are}} subject to natural {{selection}} exerted by pathogens. In contrast, domestic immune genes are largely protected from pathogen selection by veterinary care. Introgression of domestic alleles into the wild could lead to increased disease susceptibility, but observations are scarce due to low introgression rates, low disease prevalence and reduced survival of domestic hybrids. Here we report the first observation of a deleterious effect of domestic introgression on disease prevalence in a free-living large mammal. A fraction of 462 randomly sampled free-living European wild boar (Sus scrofa) was genetically identified as recent wild boar–domestic pig hybrids based on 351 SNP data. Analysis of antibody prevalence against the bacterial pathogen Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhyo) showed an increased Mhyo prevalence in wild–domestic hybrids. We argue that the most likely mechanism explaining the observed association between domestic hybrid status and Mhyo antibody prevalence would be introgression of deleterious domestic alleles.

Methods: A balloon catheter was placed in the left anterior descending coronary artery in each <b>of</b> 19 <b>domestic</b> <b>swine.</b> Blood flow and hemodynamic measurements were made at baseline, during occlusion, and at 15 and 180 min after reperfusion. Adose of approximately 925 MBq 99 mTc-BRU- 59 - 21 was injected before a brief (6 min) period of coronary occlusion at the following times: 15 min (n = 2), 5 min (n = 2), and 2. 2 min (n = 5). In 5 experiments the dose was injected 15 min after reperfusion. Animals underwent SPECT imaging 3 h later. Ani mals were then killed, and hearts were removed, sliced, stained with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride, and imaged on the detector.

To address the need for alternative treatment strategies, we assess the swine animal burn model as an initial approach for immature scar evaluation and therapeutic application. Methods: Thermal contact burns were created on the dorsum of 3 domestic swine {{with the use of}} a branding iron at 170 °F for 20 seconds. Deep partial-thickness burns were cared for with absorptive dressings over 10 weeks and wounds evaluated with laser and negative pressure transduction, histology, photographic analysis, and RNA isolation. Results: Overall average stiffness (mm Hg/mm) increased and elasticity (mm) decreased in the scars from the initial burn injury to 8 weeks when compared with normal skin (P < 0. 01). Scars were thicker, more erythematous, and uniform in the caudal dorsum. The percent change of erythema in wounds increased from weeks 6 to 10. Histology demonstrated loss of dermal papillae, increased myofibroblast presence, vertically oriented vessels, epidermal and dermal hypercellularity, and parallel-layered collagen deposition. Immature scars remained elevated at 10 weeks, and minimal RNA was able to be isolated from the tissue. Conclusions: Deep partial-thickness thermal injury to the back <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>swine</b> produces an immature hypertrophic scar by 10 weeks following burn with thickness appearing to coincide with the location along the dorsal axis.

These findings and the lack of human cases of Trichinella from the consumption of Canadian pork for nearly 2 decades suggest that the parasite has been rare in domestic swine and wild boar raised in Canada. Trichinella spiralis has only been found sporadically in swine in a small region within Nova Scotia...|$|E
40|$|Neointimal {{formation}} and cell proliferation resulting into in-stent restenosis {{is a major}} patho-physiological event following the deployment of stents in the coronary arteries. In this study, we assessed the degree of injury, based on damage to internal elastic lamina, media, exter-nal elastic lamina, and adventitia following the intravascular stenting, and {{its relationship with the}} degree of smooth muscle cell proliferation. We examined the smooth muscle cell proliferation and their phenotype at different levels of stent injury in the coronary arteries <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>swine</b> fed a normal swine diet. Five weeks after stent implantation, swine with and without stents were euthanized and coronaries were excised. Arteries were embedded in methyl methacrylate and sections were stained with H&E, trichrome, and Movat’s penta-chrome. The expression of Ki 67, α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), vimentin, and HMGB 1 was evaluated by immunofluorescence. There was a positive correlation between percent area stenosis and injury score. The distribution of SMA and vimentin was correlated with the degree of arterial injury such that arteries that had an injury score> 2 did not have immuno-reactivity to SMA in the neointimal cells near the stent struts, but these neointimal cells were positive for vimentin, suggesting a change in the smooth muscle cell phenotype. The Ki 67 and HMGB 1 immunoreactivity was highly correlated with the fragmentation of the IEL and injury in the tunica media. Thus, the extent of coronary arterial injury during interventional procedure will dictate the degree of neointimal hyperplasia, in-stent restenosis, and smooth muscle cell phenotype...|$|E
40|$|A panel {{comprising}} 16 short tandem repeats (STRs) and a gender-specific amelogenin marker was {{worked out}} and tested for robustness in discrimination between wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>swine</b> subspecies encountered in Europe, between regional populations of wild boars and between main breeds <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> pigs reared in Belarus. The STR dataset comprised 310 wild boars, inhabiting all administrative regions of Belarus, and 313 domestic pigs, representing three local and three cosmopolitan lines. Additionally, {{a total of}} 835 wild boars were genotyped {{for the presence of}} melanocortin 1 receptor (MC 1 R) alleles specific for <b>domestic</b> pigs. Correctness <b>of</b> assignment of STR profiles to appropriate populations was measured by log-likelihood ratios (log-LRs). All samples were correctly identified as wild boars or domestic pigs with average log-LR of 42. 4 (LR = 2. 6 × 1018). On the other hand, as many as 50 out of 835 (6. 0 %) genotyped wild boars from Belarus possessed MC 1 R alleles specific to domestic pigs, demonstrating supremacy of our STR profiling system over traditional differentiation between wild boars and domestic pigs, based on single binary markers. Mean log-LRs for allocation of wild boars to their regions of origin and <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> pigs to appropriate breeds were 2. 3 (LR = 9. 7) and 13. 4 (LR = 6. 6 × 105), respectively. Our results demonstrate the developed STR profiling system to be a highly efficient tool for differentiation between wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>swine</b> subspecies and between diverse breeds <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> pigs as well as for verification of genetic identity of porcine specimens for the purpose of forensic investigations of wildlife crimes, assurance of veterinary public health, parentage control in animal husbandry, food safety management and traceability of livestock products...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe authors {{aimed to}} {{validate}} a novel iliofemoral in-stent restenosis (ISR) {{model for the}} efficacy evaluation of paclitaxel-coated balloons (PCB) using the familial hypercholesterolemic swine (FHS). BackgroundMost of the validation work regarding PCB technologies has been performed in the coronary territory <b>of</b> juvenile <b>domestic</b> <b>swine.</b> Although invaluable for safety evaluation, this model is not suited {{for the evaluation of}} the efficacy of peripheral PCB technologies. MethodsTwenty-four iliofemoral segments in 12 FHS underwent balloon injury and self-expanding stent placement. After 21 days, the resulting ISR lesions were treated with either 1 μg/mm 2 dose (n = 8), or 3 μg/mm 2 dose (n = 8) PCB (Cotavance, Bayer Pharma AG/MEDRAD, Indianola, Pennsylvania), or with an identical uncoated control balloon (n = 8). ResultsAt termination (28 days after treatment), the percent diameter stenosis by quantitative vascular analysis in the control group was higher (31. 2 ± 13. 7 %) compared with the 1 μg/mm 2 (19. 3 ± 14. 0 %, 38 % reduction) and 3 μg/mm 2 (8. 6 ± 10. 7 %, 72 % reduction) PCB groups. Intravascular ultrasound analysis showed 36 % (1 μg/mm 2 dose, p = 0. 04) and 55 % (3 μg/mm 2 dose, p < 0. 01) reductions in neointimal volume stenosis. In the histological analysis, the control group showed the highest degree of percent area stenosis (65 ± 14. 3 %). The reductions in percent area stenosis was 13. 2 % (p = 0. 5) and 26 % (p = 0. 04) in the 1 μg/mm 2 and 3 μg/mm 2 dose groups, respectively. ConclusionsThe FHS model of iliofemoral ISR demonstrated a dose-dependent effect on the inhibition of neointimal proliferation of a clinically validated PCB technology. This model represents a positive step toward the efficacy evaluation of PCB in the peripheral vascular territory...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Comparison of the {{biocompatibility}} of self-expanding {{polyethylene terephthalate}} (PET) stents with self-expanding metallic stents (Wallstents). METHODS: Diameter- and length-matched PET stents and Wallstents were symmetrically {{implanted in the}} paired iliac arteries <b>of</b> 13 crossbred <b>domestic</b> <b>swine.</b> Stent deployment was studied angiographically and with intravascular ultrasound immediately after stent implantation. The angiographic stented lumen diameter was measured using quantitative vessel analysis before, immediately after stenting, and at 6 -week follow-up. Cross-section histopathology and area morphometry were performed. RESULTS: Immediately poststenting, intravascular ultrasound revealed proximal dislocation of 5 of the 13 PET stents, whereas all metal stents were firmly embedded at the implantation site. At 6 -week follow-up, three of the remaining PET stents were totally or subtotally occluded by organized thrombus, whereas all metal stents were patent. Compared with immediately poststenting, the angiographic lumen diameter within the five remaining PET stents was reduced by 30 %, {{and that of the}} metallic stents was virtually unaltered (p < 0. 02). This observation was confirmed by postmortem morphometry, wherein the PET-stented vessel segments a diameter stenosis of 40 % was measured vs only 9 % in the metallic stents (p < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: PET-stent deployment is difficult to control {{due to the lack of}} radiopacity of this stent. PET stents seem to be more thrombogenic and lead to significantly more neointimal proliferation than metallic stents. status: publishe...|$|R
