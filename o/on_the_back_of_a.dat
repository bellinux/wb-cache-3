However, 3D Realms {{did not receive}} the Quake II engine code until November 1997, and the earlier screenshots were mock-ups with the Quake engine that the team had made in their spare time. 3D Realms unveiled the first video footage of Duke Nukem Forever using the Quake II engine at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) conference. The trailer showed Duke fighting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> moving truck and firefights with aliens.

5|$|In 2008, Wong created Wandering Home, an {{installation}} {{consisting of a}} mobile home conceptualised on city living and the homeless, which was shown at the Venice Biennale of Architecture. The small tin hut <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tricycle is a comment on Hong Kong society, and the plight of people who sleep {{on the streets and}} who are forced to move on periodically by government officials. Costing HK$5,000 to make, the house is not exactly a practical solution to the homeless, but the concept was tried out on street sleepers in Sham Shui Po. In 2008, Wong created Tin Man No.11, an essay in space {{in the form of a}} metallic robot that transforms into a bed. He extended the concept by creating Famiglia Grande, a series of transformable cases. In 2009, Wong attended the Subvision Festival in Hamburg as a skyscraper.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} and final season, Aang is unable to use the Avatar State. Although {{reluctant}} with the plan at first, Aang accepts to have everyone think he had died and his remaining allies attack the Fire Nation's capital, but are thwarted by Azula. However, Zuko has a change of heart, rebels against his father, and offers to teach Aang Firebending. Aang and Zuko also improve their Firebending powers with the help of their world's last two dragons. During the finale, finding himself on a strange island, Aang is reluctant to actually kill Fire Lord Ozai, despite his four previous past lives convincing him it is the only way. But upon learning that he was actually <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Lion Turtle, one of four that made the first benders by manipulating humans' chi, Aang receives the Lion Turtles' Energybending ability. With this ability, as he regained his Avatar State, Aang removes Ozai's bending ability, rendering him harmless and ending the Hundred Year War. Later, in the Fire Nation capital, Aang is seen beside Zuko, the new Fire Lord. The series ends with Aang and his friends relaxing at Iroh's tea shop at Ba Sing Se, where Aang and Katara share a kiss.|$|E
5|$|Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch is a {{role-playing}} {{game that}} uses a third-person perspective. Players complete quests—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. Outside of quests, players can freely roam the overworld.

5|$|Tang has {{expressed}} concern about environmental and social issues through his art, such as the works They Poach the Rhino, Chop Off His Horn and Make This Drink (1989), Under the Table All Going One Direction (1992) and Tiger's Whip. He first presented the latter work, an installation and performance piece, in 1991 in Singapore's Chinatown. It consisted of ten life-sized tigers made from wire mesh covered with white linen. Tang, wearing a sleeveless white garment, dragged one of the tigers behind him. A {{modified version of the}} installation is in the Singapore Art Museum. It features a tiger with its front paws resting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rocking chair, which is draped with a piece of red cloth and with a phallus painted on it in red. The work highlights how the tiger is being hunted to extinction for its penis, which some Chinese believe has aphrodisiac qualities. In February 1995, the Museum chose Tiger's Whip to represent Singapore at the Africus International Biennale in Johannesburg, South Africa. Another of Tang's works in the Singapore Art Museum is an untitled sculpture often called Axe (1991), which is an axe with a plant growing out of its wooden handle. It is regarded as an early example of found art in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The league season {{concluded}} with an away match against divisional runners-up Scunthorpe; having gone two goals down York fought back to draw 2–2 with goals scored by Brobbel and Andrew.

York lost 1–0 to Fleetwood in the first leg at home; the goal came from former York player Matty Blair in the 50th minute, who scored from close range after Antoni Sarcevic's shot was blocked on the line.
