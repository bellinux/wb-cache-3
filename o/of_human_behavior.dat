But such a conception of happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society, and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim per se—it is instead a consequence of a successful pursuit of one's aims, of the overcoming of hurdles to one's actions—in other words, of the fulfillment of the will.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} is a theoretical {{approach in the}} social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspective. It seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved adaptations – that is, the functional products of natural selection or sexual selection in human evolution. Adaptationist thinking about physiological mechanisms, such as the heart, lungs, and immune system, is common in evolutionary biology. Some evolutionary psychologists apply the same thinking to psychology, arguing that the modularity of mind {{is similar to that of}} the body and with different modular adaptations serving different functions. Evolutionary psychologists argue that much <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>behavior</b> is the output of psychological adaptations that evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments.|$|E
25|$|From a {{biological}} point of view, human behaviors are {{essentially the same}} during crises accompanied by stock market crashes and during bubble growth when share prices exceed historic highs. During those periods, most market participants see something new for themselves, and this inevitably induces a stress response in them with accompanying changes in their endocrine profiles and motivations. The result is quantitative and qualitative changes in behavior. However, this is only one example of where behavior affecting economics and finance can be observed and variably-contrasted using behavioral economics, {{and it is a}} mistake to think of its usefulness as only applying within such environments tested-in or -of conditions similar to stock exchanges specifically. Also, often selfish-reasoning, 'adult behaviors', and similar, can be identified within criminal-concealment(s), and legal-deficiencies and neglect of different types can be observed and discovered. Awareness of indirect consequence (or lack of), at least in potential with different experimental models and methods, can be used as well—behavioral economics' potential uses are broad, but its reliability need scrutiny. An underestimation of the role of novelty as a stressor is the primary shortcoming of current approaches for market research. So, it is necessary to account for the biologically determined diphasisms <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>behavior</b> in everyday low-stress conditions and in response to stressors.|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Industrial & Manufacturing Systems EngineeringChih-Hang WuThe {{topic of}} {{infectious}} disease epidemics has recently attracted substantial attentions in research communities {{and it has}} been shown that the changes <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> have significant impacts on the dynamics of disease transmission. However, the study and understanding <b>of</b> <b>human</b> reactions into spread of infectious disease are still in the very beginning phase and how <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> change during the spread of infectious disease has not been systematically investigated. Moreover, the study <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> includes not only various enforced measures by public authorities such as school closure, quarantine, vaccination, etc, but also the spontaneous self-protective actions which are triggered by risk perception and fear of diseases. Hence, the goal of this research is to study the impacts <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> to the epidemic from these two perspectives: spontaneous behavioral changes and public intervention strategies. For the sake of studying spontaneous changes <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>behaviors,</b> this research first time applied evolutionary spatial game into the study <b>of</b> <b>human</b> reactions to the spread of infectious disease. This method integrated contact structures and epidemics information into the individuals’ decision processes, by adding two different types of information into the payoff functions: the local information and global information. The new method would not only advance the field of game theory, but also the field of epidemiology. In addition, this method was also applied to a classic compartmental dynamic system which is a widely used model for studying the disease transmission. With extensive numerical studies, the results first proved the consistency of two models for the sake of validating the effectiveness of the spatial evolutionary game. Then the impacts <b>of</b> changes <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> to the dynamics of disease transmission and how information impacts <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> were discussed temporally and spatially. In addition to the spontaneous behavioral changes, the corresponding intervention strategies by policy-makers played the key role in process of mitigating the spread of infectious disease. For the purpose of minimizing the total lost, including the social costs and number of infected individuals, the intervention strategies should be optimized. Sensitivity analysis, stability analysis, bifurcation analysis, and optimal control methods are possible tools to understand the effects of different combination of intervention strategies or even find an appropriate policy to mitigate the disease transmission. One zoonotic disease, named Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis (ZVL), was studied by adopting different methods and assumptions. Particularly, a special case, backward bifurcation, was discussed for the transmission of ZVL. Last but not least, the methodology and modeling framework used in this dissertation can be expanded to other disease situations and intervention applications, and have a broad impact to the research area related to mathematical modeling, epidemiology, decision-making processes, and industrial engineering. The further studies can combine the changes <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> and intervention strategies by policy-makers so as to seek an optimal information dissemination to minimize the social costs and the number of infected individuals. If successful, this research should aid policy-makers by improving communication between them and the public, by directing educational efforts, and by predicting public response to infectious diseases and new risk management strategies (regulations, vaccination, quarantine, etc.) ...|$|R

The topological properties of the networks, such as scale-free property, small-world effect and hierarchical structure imply that close relationships exist between the amounts of repetitious actions performed by people during certain periods of time, especially for some important days. Finally, the networks obtained are verified to be not fractal and self-similar using box-counting method.

In his own novels James explored more of the psychological motives of the characters and less of the historical sweep exhibited by Balzac—a conscious style preference; he stated: [...] "the artist of the Comédie Humaine is half smothered by the historian".
