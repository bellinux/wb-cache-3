5|$|The Garden of Words is {{considered}} a romance and drama film. It <b>opens</b> <b>at</b> {{the start of the}} rainy season in Tokyo with , a 15-year-old student and aspiring shoemaker, opting to skip his first class and sketch shoe designs in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen. There he encounters , a 27-year-old woman who is skipping work and enjoying beer and chocolate. When she notices the school crest on his uniform, Yukari bids him farewell with a tanka (a form of Japanese poetry), leaving Takao puzzled as to its origin and meaning. The two continue to encounter each other and socialize in the park on rainy mornings, but never formally introduce themselves. After Yukari expresses an interest in Takao's shoemaking, he decides to make a pair of shoes in her size. With the end of the rainy season, Takao stops visiting the park and focuses on his work.|$|E
5|$|Coconut crabs mate {{frequently}} and quickly {{on dry land}} in the period from May to September, especially between early June and late August. Male coconut crabs have spermatophores and deposit a mass of spermatophores on the abdomen of the female; the abdomen <b>opens</b> <b>at</b> {{the base of the}} third pereiopods, and fertilisation is thought to occur on the external surface of the abdomen as the eggs pass through the spermatophore mass. The extrusion of eggs occurs on land in crevices or burrows near the shore. Shortly thereafter, the female lays her eggs and glues them to the underside of her abdomen, carrying the fertilised eggs underneath her body for a few months. At the time of hatching, the female coconut crab releases the eggs into the ocean. This usually takes place on rocky shores at dusk, especially when this coincides with high tide. The empty egg cases remain on the female's body after the larvae have been released, and the female eats the egg cases within a few days.|$|E
5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. The heart is a tube in {{the upper part of the}} body, with a few ostia that act as non-return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only the upper part of the abdomen, and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that <b>opens</b> <b>at</b> the rear end of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax. Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E

5|$|Mating {{occurs during}} the winter months. Once a female quoll has been impregnated, the folds on her abdomen convert into a pouch that <b>opens</b> <b>at</b> the back. The {{gestation}} period is 21 days. A baby quoll, or pup, {{is the size of}} a grain of rice. Up to 18 quolls are born in each litter, but only six survive the first two weeks. The survivors stay in their mother's pouch for eight weeks, suckling on one of the mother's six teats for milk. During the ninth week, the pups venture out of the pouch and onto the mother's back, where they remain for six weeks. Quolls reaches maturity when they are one year old, and have a natural lifespan of between two and five years. A 2008 study of the pouches of tiger quolls reported the pouches' appearance' were reliable indicators of the quolls' reproductive status: during the follicular phase, pouches were found to be red and have many secretions. After ovulation, pouches became deep and wet. Researchers can use this information to determine where a female quoll is in her ovarian cycle, which is anticipated to be helpful in breeding management.|$|E
5|$|Most {{outbound}} O-Bahn bus routes {{travel through}} the Adelaide city centre along Grenfell Street, left onto East Terrace, right onto Rundle Road through the Adelaide park lands {{to the north of}} Rymill Park, then left onto Dequetteville Terrace, which changes name to Hackney Road at the next major intersection. The Adelaide Botanic Garden is then on the left, followed by Botanic Park before the road crosses a bridge over the River Torrens. Soon after here, the two carriageways of the city ring route separate and swing to the northwest past North Adelaide, and the northbound entrance to the O-Bahn busway leaves the right hand side of the surface road and dips under the southbound carriageway to join the inbound track, both heading northeast. This on-street route will change when the O-Bahn City Access Project (see below) <b>opens</b> <b>at</b> the end of 2017. That will provide a 670 metre guided busway tunnel straight on from Grenfell Street, passing under Rymill Park and Rundle Road to surface for a short distance of on-road running on Hackney Road.|$|E

25|$|Virilization {{of genetically}} female (XX) infants usually {{produces}} obvious genital ambiguity. Inside the pelvis, the ovaries are normal {{and since they}} have not been exposed to testicular antimullerian hormone (MIF), the uterus, fallopian tubes, upper vagina, and other mullerian structures are normally formed as well. However, the high levels of testosterone in the blood can enlarge the phallus, partially or completely close the vaginal opening, enclose the urethral groove so that it <b>opens</b> <b>at</b> the base of the phallus, on the shaft or even at the tip like a boy. Testosterone can cause the labial skin to become as thin and rugated as a scrotum, but cannot produce palpable gonads (i.e., testes) in the folds.|$|E
