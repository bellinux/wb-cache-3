The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration <b>of</b> <b>esters</b> in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E

25|$|Lithium {{aluminium}} hydride, commonly {{abbreviated to}} LAH, is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula LiAlH4. It {{was discovered by}} Finholt, Bond and Schlesinger in 1947. This compound {{is used as a}} reducing agent in organic synthesis, especially for the reduction <b>of</b> <b>esters,</b> carboxylic acids, and amides. The solid is dangerously reactive toward water, releasing gaseous hydrogen (H2). Some related derivatives have been discussed for hydrogen storage.|$|E
25|$|Samarium iodide is {{effective}} for {{the reduction of}} {{a wide array of}} functional groups; however, other reducing agents are more useful in certain contexts. SmI2 causes reductive dimerization of allylic or benzylic halides, and chiral halides undergo non-stereospecific reduction. On the other hand, its functional group compatibility is greater than many reducing agents—halide reduction is possible in the presence <b>of</b> <b>esters</b> or alcohols. Reductive fragmentations with samarium iodide have the disadvantage that they are not stereospecific; however, stereoselectivity is higher in some cases when SmI2 is used in place of other reducing agents. Reduction of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids and derivatives to the corresponding saturated carbonyl compounds by SmI2 is a useful transformation mediated by few other reducing agents. The mild reaction conditions employed for samarium iodide reductions represent a significant advantage of the reaction over other single-electron reductions, including dissolving metal reduction and transition-metal induced methods.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen the rapid and {{successful}} deployment <b>of</b> <b>ester</b> oils as transformer dielectrics. When evaluating the compatibility <b>of</b> <b>ester</b> oils with existing transformer insulation designs, {{it is essential to}} not only compare the mean breakdown voltages of the oils, but also to consider the role of dispersion and thus the withstand voltage levels (with the acceptable breakdown likelihood). Insulation designers sometimes estimate the withstand voltage of mineral oil from the dispersion of the data, assuming that the breakdown voltages of the oil follow a parametric distribution. However, {{there is a lack of}} discussion as to whether this method would be suitable for estimating the withstand voltages <b>of</b> <b>ester</b> oils. This paper uses samples of breakdown voltages <b>of</b> a synthetic <b>ester,</b> a natural ester and a mineral oil to analyze their distributions, and discusses the applicability of using Weibull and Gaussian distributions to estimate the withstand voltages <b>of</b> the <b>esters.</b> It is found that the distributions <b>of</b> <b>ester</b> breakdown voltages, in particular the lowest breakdown voltage, are similar to those of mineral oil. Consequently there is evidence that from the ac withstand voltage point of view the tested esters are compatible for the use in power transformers...|$|R

25|$|Non-17α-alkylated {{testosterone}} derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone {{all have}} poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. A notable {{exception to this}} are AAS that are androgen precursors or prohormones, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenediol, androstenedione, boldione (androstadienedione), bolandiol (norandrostenediol), bolandione (norandrostenedione), dienedione, mentabolan (MENT dione, trestione), and methoxydienone (methoxygonadiene) (although these are relatively weak AAS). AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively in the form <b>of</b> <b>esters</b> administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, {{though they may be}} esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well.|$|E

However, viscosity <b>of</b> ethyl <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> nerium oil (EEON) was slightly higher than that <b>of</b> methyl <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> nerium oil (MEON).

2500|$|Some of the aromas {{perceived}} in wine are from esters {{created by the}} reaction of acids and alcohol in the wine. Esters can develop during fermentation, with the influence of yeast, or later during aging by chemical reactions. The precise yeast strain used during fermentation and temperature {{are two of the}} strongest indicators of what kind <b>of</b> <b>esters</b> will develop and helps explain partially why Chardonnay grown in the same vineyard but made by two different producers could have different aromatics. During bottle aging hydrogen ions, found in higher concentration in low pH (high acid) wines, serves as a catalyst in the formation <b>of</b> <b>esters</b> from acids and alcohols present in the wine. However, at the same time these hydrogen ions encourage esters to also split apart back into acids and alcohols. These two counterbalancing acts gradually inch a wine closer to a state of [...] where there is equal parts alcohol, acids, esters and water (a by product of the reactions). During this period the ester influenced bouquet of the wine is constantly changing due to the concentration, formulation and splitting of different esters. This is partly the reason why a wine will have one set of aromas at one time and other aromas later in its life.|$|E

2500|$|When {{biodiesel}} is cooled below {{a certain}} point, {{some of the}} molecules aggregate and form crystals. The fuel starts to appear cloudy once the crystals become larger than {{one quarter of the}} wavelengths of visible light – this is the cloud point (CP). As the fuel is cooled further these crystals become larger. The lowest temperature at which fuel can pass through a 45micrometre filter is the cold filter plugging point (CFPP). As biodiesel is cooled further it will gel and then solidify. Within Europe, there are differences in the CFPP requirements between countries. This is reflected in the different national standards of those countries. The temperature at which pure (B100) biodiesel starts to gel varies significantly and depends upon the mix <b>of</b> <b>esters</b> and therefore the feedstock oil used to produce the biodiesel.
