40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe strong {{association}} between smoking {{history and the}} presence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations has been proven in non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which explains the favorable response to EGFR–tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy in nonsmoking NSCLC patients. However, few studies directly focus on the relationship between EGFR-TKI's efficacy and smoking history in NSCLC EGFR-mutant patients. MethodsElectronic databases were searched for eligible literatures. Data on <b>objective</b> <b>response</b> <b>rates,</b> disease control rates, and progression-free survival (PFS) stratified by smoking status were extracted and synthesized {{on the basis of a}} random-effect model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted. ResultsA total of 9 studies that involved a total of 1029 EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC patients after EGFR-TKI treatment were included. In overall, nonsmoking was associated with significant prolonged PFS (HR, 0. 73, 0. 60 to 0. 88; P =. 001) compared to ever smokers. However, only marginal improvements without statistical significance in <b>objective</b> <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> (odds ratio, 1. 11; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 85 to 1. 46; P =. 433) and disease control rate (odds ratio, 1. 04; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 82 to 1. 33; P =. 740) were observed. Subgroup analyses showed that the benefits of PFS in nonsmokers were predominantly presented in pooled results of studies enrolling patients with active EGFR mutations, studies involving previously treated patients, and retrospective studies. Additionally, we failed to observe any significant benefit from nonsmokers in every subgroup for <b>objective</b> <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> and disease control rate. ConclusionFor advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations, nonsmoking is associated with longer PFS than ever smoking after EGFR-TKIs treatment. Smoking history should be considered an essential factor in studies regarding EGFR-targeted agents toward EGFR-mutant patients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The prognoses of {{patients}} with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP) are extremely poor. Treatment {{of patients}} with nonlymphoid CML-BP is associated with very low <b>response</b> <b>rates,</b> a median survival of 2 - 3 months, and significant toxicities. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the results of therapy in CML-BP with different treatments in relation to <b>response</b> <b>rate,</b> survival, and toxicity. METHODS: A total of 162 adults patients with a diagnosis of nonlymphoid CML-BP referred from 1986 to 1997 were included in this analysis. Only first salvage therapy was considered for the purpose of this analysis. The blastic phase of CML was defined by the presence of 30 % or more blasts in the blood or bone marrow, or extramedullary disease. Ninety patients were treated with intensive chemotherapy, 31 with decitabine, and 41 with other single agents. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (22 %) had an <b>objective</b> <b>response.</b> <b>Response</b> <b>rates</b> were similar among patients treated with intensive chemotherapy (28 %) or with decitabine (26 %). In aggregate, other single agents showed <b>objective</b> <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> of 7 %. The median duration of remission for all patients was 29 weeks and the median overall survival 22 weeks. Patients treated with decitabine showed a trend toward better survival, despite a higher percentage of older patients (P < 0. 004). The median survival times were 29 weeks with decitabine, 21 weeks with intensive chemotherapy, and 22 weeks with other agents. When only older patients were considered, survival was significantly better with decitabine versus other treatments (P < 0. 01). A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors for survival confirmed the independent, significant favorable effect of decitabine therapy (P = 0. 047). In all groups complications of myelosuppression were the most significant side effects. Severe nonhematologic toxicities were not observed in patients treated with decitabine; they occurred in 20 % and 17 % of patients treated with intensive chemotherapy or other single agents, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with intensive chemotherapy, decitabine showed favorable results, with similar <b>objective</b> <b>response</b> <b>rates,</b> a better nonhematologic toxicity profile, and a trend for better survival, particularly among older patients.

Primary endpoint is locoregional control, secondary endpoints include acute radiation effects and adverse events. Evaluation of disease response is carried out according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST); toxicity is assessed using NCI CTC v 3. 0. Results: Treatment was tolerated moderately well, acneiforme erythema occurred in 74. 1 % (grade II/III), mucositis grade III in 28. 6 %, and radiation dermatitis grade III in 14. 3 %.

40|$|Introduction: Chemotherapy of well {{differentiated}} neuroendocrine gastroenteropancreatic tumors showed lower <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> {{compared to}} poorly differentiated or anaplastic neuroendocrine tumors. Purpose {{of the present}} study was the evaluation of the efficacy of a chemotherapy with streptozotocin, 5 -fluorouracil and folinic-acid in well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors with different primaries and functionality. Patients and methods: 34 patients with a histologically proven metastatic well differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (n= 21 foregut, n= 10 midgut, n= 1 hindgut, n= 2 unknown primary; n= 15 non-functional, n= 19 functional) were treated with streptozotocin, 5 -fluorouracil and folinic-acid for a maximum of 12 cycles. <b>Objective</b> <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> as well as the effect on the clinical symptoms and on the serum chromogranin-A levels were determined. Results: 5 / 34 patients with an initial tumor progression showed a partial tumor regression and 18 / 34 patients showed stable disease which persists in some cases for more than 12 months. In 11 / 34 patients an ungoing tumor progression was observed despite chemotherapy. Neuroendocrine foregut tumors showed higher <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> compared to midgut tumors. The mean survival rates were 25, 6 resp. 28, 9 months. With chemotherapy the carcinoid symptoms decreased significantly. Lower and under chemotherapy stable chromogranin-A levels were good prognostic markers. Discussion: The present study shows in a small number of patients, that chemotherapy with streptozotocin, 5 -fluorouracil and folinic-acid is beneficial concerning <b>objective</b> <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> as well as clinical symptoms in patients with well differentiated neuroendocrine gastroenteropancreatic tumors.

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} the treatment efficiency of whole brain irradiation combined with precise radiotherapy on triple-negative (TN) phenotype {{breast cancer patients}} with brain metastases and their survival times. Materials and Methods : A total of 112 metastatic breast cancer patients treated with whole brain irradiation and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or 3 D conformal radiotherapy (3 DCRT) were analyzed. Thirty-seven patients were of TN phenotype. <b>Objective</b> <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> were compared. Survival times were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank {{test was used to}} compare the survival time difference between the TN and non-TN groups. Potential prognostic factors were determined by using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. Results : The efficiency of radiotherapy treatment on TN and non-TN phenotypes was 96. 2 % and 97 %, respectively. TN phenotype was associated with worse survival times than non-TN phenotype after radiotherapy (6. 9 months vs. 17 months) (P < 0. 01). On multivariate analysis, good prognosis was associated with non-TN status, lower graded prognosis assessment class, and nonexistence of active extracranial metastases. Conclusion: After whole brain irradiation followed by IMRT or 3 DCRT treatment, TN phenotype breast cancer patients with intracranial metastasis had high <b>objective</b> <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> but shorter survival time. With respect to survival in breast cancer patients with intracranial metastasis, the TN phenotype represents a significant adverse prognostic factor...|$|R

This trial was the first to report a survival advantage from chemotherapy in malignant pleural mesothelioma, showing a statistically significant improvement in median survival from 10 months in the patients treated with cisplatin alone to 13.3 months in the group of patients treated with cisplatin in the combination with pemetrexed and who also received supplementation with folate and vitamin B12. Vitamin supplementation was given to most patients in the trial and pemetrexed related side effects were significantly less in patients receiving pemetrexed when they also received daily oral folate 500mcg and intramuscular vitamin B12 1000mcg every 9 weeks compared with patients receiving pemetrexed without vitamin supplementation. The <b>objective</b> <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> increased from 20% in the cisplatin group to 46% in the combination pemetrexed group. Some side effects such as nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, and diarrhoea were more common in the combination pemetrexed group but only affected a minority of patients and overall the combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin was well tolerated when patients received vitamin supplementation; both quality of life and lung function tests improved in the combination pemetrexed group. In February 2004, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved pemetrexed for treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma. However, there are still unanswered questions about the optimal use of chemotherapy, including when to start treatment, and the optimal number of cycles to give. Cisplatin and pemetrexed together give patients a median survival of 12.1 months.|$|E

There were 16 females and 7 males, median age 68 years. They received a total tumor dose of 48 Gy (range 1. 7 – 60) at the ICRU point with single fractions of 1. 7 to 2 Gy. Results: Among the 23 patients, 14 had measurable disease. <b>Objective</b> tumor <b>responses</b> were seen in 4 / 4 gallbladder carcinomas (1 CR, 3 PR), 4 / 5 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (2 CR, 2 PR), and 1 / 5 hepatobiliary cancers (1 PR), leading to an overall <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> of 64 %. The tumors remained locally controlled in 12 ou...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of interferons {{in the treatment}} of malignant melanoma has been mainly {{in the treatment of}} advanced disease using interferons as the sole agent or in combination with other agents. Studies of the value of interferons as adjuvant therapy in high-risk primary melanoma patients are necessary, but no results have been published to date. Human interferon alpha produces low <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> as a sole agent, but in combination with cimetidine, a 30 % <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> has been achieved. Recombinant alpha interferons give responses of 15 %- 20 % in advanced melanomas, and combination with cimetidine does not enhance the <b>response</b> <b>rate.</b> Recombinant alpha interferons have been used in combination with other interferons, cimetidine, monoclonal antibodies, and cytotoxics, with either no or small improvement in <b>response</b> <b>rates.</b> DTIC with recombinant interferon alpha- 2 a has been shown to produce <b>objective</b> <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> of 26 %, with low toxicity and maintenance of quality of life. A randomized trial with DTIC as the sole agent, compared with combination treatment, is being conducted to determine the significance of this finding...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{introduction}} of immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized treatment of multiple cancers and has bolstered {{interest in this}} treatment approach. So far, emerging clinical data show limited clinical efficacy of these agents in ovarian cancer with <b>objective</b> <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> of 10 – 15 % with some durable responses. In this review, we present emerging clinical data of completed trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors and review ongoing studies. In addition we examine the current knowledge of the tumor microenvironment of ovarian cancers {{with a focus on}} the significance of PD-L 1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes on predicting response to immune checkpoint blockade. We evaluate approaches to improve treatment outcomes through the use of predictive biomarkers and patient selection. Finally, we review management considerations including immune related adverse events and response criteria...|$|R
