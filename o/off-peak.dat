5|$|A 7-Day Short Trip Pass for $38.50, {{valid for}} seven {{consecutive}} days for Metrorail trips costing up to $3.85 (the maximum <b>off-peak</b> fare) during peak fare times and any trip during <b>off-peak</b> hours. If the trip {{costs more than}} $3.60 the difference is deducted from the cash balance of a SmarTrip card, possibly after the necessary value is added at the Exitfare machine. A non-negative stored value is required to enter the Metrorail system.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{multiple}} units began running on 1 January 1905 and by 20 March all local services between Baker Street and Harrow were electric. The use of six-car trains was considered wasteful on the lightly used line to Uxbridge and in running an <b>off-peak</b> three-car shuttle to Harrow the Met aroused the displeasure of the Board of Trade {{for using a}} motor car to propel two trailers. A short steam train was used for <b>off-peak</b> services {{from the end of}} March while some trailers were modified to add a driving cab, entering service from 1 June.|$|E
5|$|Temple Mills Depot in Leyton is {{used for}} storage and {{servicing}} of Eurostar trains and <b>off-peak</b> berthing of Class 395 Southeastern high-speed trains.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} {{for this}} line is 2–3 minutes during peak periods and 4–5 minutes during <b>off-peak</b> periods.|$|E
5|$|To {{increase}} {{satisfaction with}} the public transport, free morning <b>off-peak</b> travel was introduced while improvements are ongoing.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, WMATA {{board member}} Jim Graham and D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams {{proposed}} re-extending Yellow Line service to Fort Totten {{or even to}} Greenbelt, which was the originally planned northern terminus for the line. Their proposal did not involve construction of any new track, because either extension would run along the same route as the existing Green Line and would thus relieve crowding on that line. Suburban {{members of the board}} initially resisted the proposal. Through a compromise that also increased service on the Red Line, on April 20, 2006 the WMATA board approved a Yellow Line extension to the Fort Totten station during <b>off-peak</b> hours. An 18-month pilot program began on December 31, 2006, at a cost of $5.75 million to the District of Columbia. As of 2011, the <b>off-peak</b> service continues.|$|E
5|$|In March 2001, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey {{implemented}} a discount on regular toll fees during <b>off-peak</b> hours for those vehicles paying electronically with an EZ Pass issued in New York State. These discount toll was {{implemented a}}t several tunnels and bridges connecting New York City and New Jersey, including the George Washington Bridge, Lincoln Tunnel, and Holland Tunnel, {{and at some}} other bridges administrated by PANYNJ. Since March 2008, qualified low-emission automobiles with a fuel economy of at least 45 miles per gallon are eligible to receive a Port Authority Green Pass, which allows for a 50% discount during <b>off-peak</b> hours {{as compared to the}} regular full toll.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 2006, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), Montgomery County and {{the state}} of Maryland {{announced}} an agreement to end the <b>off-peak</b> terminations at Grosvenor, having those trains operate instead between Grosvenor and Silver Spring.|$|E
5|$|The last S {{sets were}} {{withdrawn}} from Mortdale Maintenance Depot in March 2013 with all services now provided by Tangara and OSCAR sets. Trains typically operate with 12 services per hour in peak, six services per hour in <b>off-peak,</b> and {{four to six}} services per hour on weekends and public holidays.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1959 to {{coincide}} with the Hunterston A nuclear power station in Ayrshire. Cruachan uses cheap <b>off-peak</b> electricity generated at night to pump water to the higher reservoir, which can then be released during the day to provide power as necessary. The power station is open to visitors, and around 50,000 tourists visit it each year.|$|E
5|$|Designed {{for future}} {{expansion}} to accommodate additional aircraft, {{there has been}} talk of a terminal expansion, though official plans {{have yet to be}} announced. However, with the gate space being used to 100 percent capacity at peak times, there is very little capacity available for new flights unless they arrive and depart at <b>off-peak</b> times (10 AM-12 PM),(7 PM-10 PM).|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the Athens Airport {{charged a}} 25% higher landing fee for those {{aircraft}} arriving between 11:00 and 17:00 during the high tourism season during summer. Hong Kong charges an additional flat fee {{to the basic}} weight charge. In 1991–92 peak pricing at London's main airports Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted was implemented; airlines were charged different landing fees for peak and <b>off-peak</b> operations depending on the weight of aircraft. For example, {{in the case of}} a Boeing 757, the peak landing fee was about 2.5 times higher than the <b>off-peak</b> fee in all three airports. For a Boeing 747 the differential was even higher, as the old 747 carries a higher noise charge. Though related to runway congestion, the main objective of these peak charges at the major British airports was to raise revenue for investment.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, <b>off-peak</b> {{there was}} a train every 4–5minutes from Wembley Park to Baker Street. There were {{generally}} two services per hour from both Watford and Uxbridge that ran non-stop from Wembley Park and stopping services started from Rayners Lane, Wembley Park, and Neasden, although most did not stop at Marlborough Road and St John's Wood Road. <b>Off-peak,</b> stations north of Moor Park were generally served by Marylebone trains. During the peak trains approached Baker Street every 2.5–3minutes, half running through to Moorgate, Liverpool Street or Aldgate. On the inner circle a train from Hammersmith ran through Baker Street every 6minutes, and Kensington (Addison Road) services terminated at Edgware Road. Maintaining a frequency of ten trains {{an hour on the}} circle was proving difficult and the solution chosen was for the District to extend its Putney to Kensington High Street service around the circle to Edgware Road, using the new platforms, and the Met to provide all the inner circle trains at a frequency of eight trains an hour.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 2016 {{the route}} saw several changes. Faster buses were {{introduced}} at peak time between Manchester and Burnley, and the route was extended twice an hour beyond Burnley to Skipton via the M65 and Colne. Nelson, however, {{is no longer}} served by <b>off-peak</b> X43 buses, although services remain during peak hours. A Sunday extension of the route to Grassington was introduced; these services had already operated, but had previously used route number 872.|$|E
5|$|On this line, {{the station}} is on the Bank or City branch; the next {{stations}} are Borough {{to the north and}} Kennington to the south. The typical <b>off-peak</b> service (as of January 2015) in trains per hour (tph) is 10tph northbound to each of High Barnet and Edgware and 20tph southbound to Morden.|$|E
5|$|Since June 25, 2017, {{the first}} fare hike in three years, peak-period rail fares {{increased}} 10 cents, with $2.25 {{as the new}} minimum and $6 as the maximum one-way fare. <b>Off-peak</b> fares rose 25 cents, to $2 minimum, $3.85 maximum, as will bus fares. A new one-day unlimited rail/bus pass {{will be available for}} $14.75.|$|E
5|$|The campus’s {{recycling}} system reduces UND’s overall {{waste stream}} by 20 percent. UND has conducted lighting retrofits and installed heat recovery systems and power management technology for peak and <b>off-peak</b> use adjustment. Students {{are involved in}} promoting sustainability via recycling and other initiatives. The University received a B- grade on the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card released by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.|$|E
5|$|The line is {{operated}} on a four/five-minute headway by all-stops trams, with an eight-minute headway in <b>off-peak</b> times and a 20 minutes headway at night. Travel time from Byparken to Lagunen is 32 minutes. In 2015, the full {{price of a}} single ticket is NOK 35. Tickets are valid with free transfer to buses in Bergen.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} timetable allowed 18 {{minutes for}} the journey. <b>Off-peak</b> service frequency was every 15 minutes, increased to ten minutes during the morning peak and reduced 20 minutes in the early mornings and after 8pm. From May 1864, workmen's returns were offered on the 5:30am and 5:40am services from Paddington {{at the cost of}} a single ticket (3d).|$|E
5|$|Victoria {{platforms}} 1–8 {{provide the}} London terminus for services on the Chatham Main Line operated by Southeastern, serving South East London, Kent, the South East Coast and The Medway Towns. There are typical <b>off-peak</b> metro services to Orpington and Sevenoaks {{as well as}} main line services to Ramsgate, Dover Priory, Gillingham and Ashford International.|$|E
5|$|Victoria {{platforms}} 9–12 and 15–19 {{provide one}} of two London termini for services on the Brighton Main Line operated by Southern, serving South London, Sussex, Brighton and The South Coast. There are <b>off-peak</b> metro services to London Bridge and Sutton and main line services to Bognor Regis, Brighton, Epsom, Ore, Portsmouth Harbour and Southampton Central.|$|E
5|$|According to the plan, {{the type}} of {{consumption}} (i.e. whether agricultural, industrial and civil) will also be considered when setting energy prices. The subsidy plan will be implemented in proportion with geographical regions because warm regions consume more electricity during summer while cold regions consume more gas during winter. Finally, the time of consumption (i.e. during peak and <b>off-peak</b> hours) and the consumption demand (i.e. whether it is low or high) will be taken into consideration.|$|E
5|$|After {{the branch}} north of Fort Totten opened, the Green Line Commuter Shortcut {{began as a}} six-month {{experiment}} on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers {{to get on a}} train on the Green Line segment during rush hours and travel as far as Farragut North on the Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during <b>off-peak</b> hours. This was accomplished by utilizing a single-track spur (B & E connection) between the Green and Red Lines near (and bypassing) Fort Totten station. This shortcut was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed.|$|E
5|$|AirTrain JFK is free {{within the}} {{terminal}} area {{and to the}} hotel and car rental shuttle buses at Federal Circle. Entering or leaving the system at the Jamaica or Howard Beach stations requires that a $5 fare be paid using a MetroCard. A $1 fee is charged for all new MetroCard purchases. Transferring to the Q3, Q10, or B15 from Terminal 5 requires an extra $2.75 fare, since the MTA does not offer free transfers from the AirTrain. Consequently, entering the subway at either Jamaica or Howard Beach costs $7.75, and entering the LIRR at Jamaica costs $14.25 during peak hours and $9 during <b>off-peak</b> with the LIRR CityTicket.|$|E
5|$|Alternate plans {{included}} constructing {{two sets}} of two tubes, one for commuter and freight service from the LIRR {{and the other for}} rapid transit, or two tunnels each with individual tubes for freight and subway service. The freight service would have occurred during <b>off-peak</b> hours only, but simultaneous with subway service, with passenger trains running in 30-minute or one-hour headways during these times. A 1912 proposal had freight running at night between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., while the 1925 plans called for joint freight and passenger service during early mornings (5 a.m. to 6 a.m.), middays (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.), and overnights (8 p.m. to 5 a.m.).|$|E
5|$|Breathing {{air supply}} can come {{directly}} from a high-pressure breathing air compressor, from a high-pressure storage system, or from a combined storage system with compressor. Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate will be limited by the available power source and capacity of the compressor. A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure air by recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost <b>off-peak</b> electrical power.|$|E
5|$|By 1959, {{the pattern}} of {{commuter}} services at Herne Hill had taken the shape it held into the 21st century: all-stops trains from Victoria to Orpington and from the City of London to Wimbledon and Sutton (but, unlike the modern Sutton Loop, via West Croydon). However, there was {{a decline in the}} number of electric trains on the Chatham Main Line through Herne Hill in the years after the war. Immediately after electrification in 1925, six trains used the route between Herne Hill and Shortlands in each direction during every <b>off-peak</b> hour. By 1960, it had dropped to two trains in each direction.|$|E
5|$|In 1907 the weekday <b>off-peak</b> {{service was}} four trains per hour from East Ham to Ealing Broadway, four per hour from Mansion House to {{alternately}} Richmond and Wimbledon and two per hour from Wimbledon to High Street Kensington and Ealing Broadway to Whitechapel. Four trains per hour ran from Putney Bridge to Earl's Court, two continuing to High Street Kensington. From South Harrow {{there were two}} trains per hour to Mill Hill Park, and four trains per hour from Hounslow Barracks to Mill Hill Park, two of these continuing to South Acton.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, BART stated its {{intention}} to improve non-peak (night and weekend) headways for each line to 15 minutes. The current 20-minute headways at these times is a barrier to ridership. In mid-2007, BART temporarily reversed its position stating that the shortened wait times would likely not happen due to a $900,000 state revenue budget shortfall. Nevertheless, BART eventually confirmed {{the implementation of the}} plan by January 2008. Continued budgetary problems halted the expanded non-peak service and returned <b>off-peak</b> headways to 20 minutes in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In March 1908, the <b>off-peak</b> {{shuttle service}} {{began to use}} the western tunnel on the branch, {{crossing}} between the two branch tunnels south of Holborn. Low usage led to {{the withdrawal of the}} second peak-hour shuttle and the eastern tunnel was taken out of use in 1914. Sunday services ended in April 1917 and, in August of the same year, the eastern tunnel and the bay platform at Holborn were formally closed. Passenger numbers on the branch remained low: when the branch was considered for closure in 1929, its annual usage was 1,069,650 and takings were £4,500. The branch was again considered for closure in 1933, but remained open.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 1932 the District {{service from}} Acton Town to South Harrow was {{withdrawn}} {{and one in}} three Piccadilly trains extended from Hammersmith to South Harrow, the District continuing to run a shuttle from South Harrow to Uxbridge. On 18 December 1932 all four tracks to Northfields opened and from 9 January 1933 Piccadilly trains started to run to Northfields, continuing to Hounslow West from 13 March 1933. District trains continued to run through to Hounslow <b>off-peak,</b> with a shuttle from South Acton.|$|E
5|$|The Yellow Line of the Washington Metro {{consists}} of 17 rapid transit stations from Huntington in Virginia to either Mount Vernon Square (where peak hours trains terminate) or Fort Totten (outside of peak hours). Additional Yellow Line trains may continue passenger service to Greenbelt during <b>off-peak</b> hours and weekends {{in order to}} stage them for Green Line service or for storage at the Greenbelt rail yard. In non rush/peak hours, almost all regularly scheduled trains run to Fort Totten.|$|E
5|$|The <b>off-peak</b> District Hounslow branch {{shuttle to}} South Acton was {{discontinued}} on 29 April 1935 {{and replaced by}} an Acton Town to South Acton shuttle. This shuttle was withdrawn on 28 February 1959, and the peak hour District line through service to Hounslow was withdrawn on 9 October 1964. In the 1970s the Hounslow branch became the Heathrow branch when it was extended to serve Heathrow Airport, first on 19 July 1975 to serve Hatton Cross and then on 16 December 1977 when Heathrow Central opened.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the system}} began in May 1998. The {{majority}} {{of the system}} was built one span at a time, with cranes mounted on temporary structures erecting new spans as they progressed along the structures. However, some sections were built using a balanced cantilever design, where spans were first built {{on their own and}} then connected to each other using the span-by-span method. The fact that the Jamaica branch had to be built {{in the middle of the}} Van Wyck Expressway, combined with the varying length and curves of the track spans, caused complications during construction. One lane in each direction was closed during the <b>off-peak</b> hours, causing congestion on the Van Wyck.|$|E

5|$|In March 1908, the <b>off-peak</b> {{shuttle service}} {{began to use}} the western {{platform}} at Strand and the through platform at Holborn, crossing between the two branch tunnels south of Holborn. Low usage led to {{the withdrawal of the}} second peak-hour shuttle and the eastern tunnel was taken out of use in 1914. On 9 May 1915, three of the Underground stations in the area were renamed and Strand station became Aldwych. Sunday services ended in April 1917 and, in August of the same year, the eastern tunnel and platform at Aldwych and the bay platform at Holborn were formally closed. A German bombing campaign in September 1917 led to the disused platform being used as storage for around 300 paintings from the National Gallery from then until December 1918.|$|E
