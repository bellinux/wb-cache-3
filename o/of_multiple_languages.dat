500|$|While Kalidas primary {{language}} was Tamil, the film's actors spoke {{a variety of}} languages, including Tamil (Rajalakshmi), Telugu (Venkatesan) and Hindi (Prasad). Because Venkatesan's first language was Telugu, {{and he could not}} correctly pronounce Tamil words, his dialogue was in Telugu. According to Guy, Irani was initially unsure if the German sound recording equipment would record the Tamil language; to assuage his doubts, he had some actors speak and sing in Tamil, Venkatesan in Telugu, and, because the equipment had already recorded Hindi before, he had other actors speak Hindi; the equipment recorded each language clearly. Owing to the use <b>of</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>languages,</b> sources including Film News Anandan, Birgit Meyer, and Guy have refused to call Kalidas the first Tamil sound film; Guy instead called it India's first multilingual film. In the 2010 book Cinemas of South India: Culture, Resistance, Ideology, Sowmya Dechamma states that Telugu dialogues were included in the film, apparently to [...] "increase its market potential in the two important language markets of southern India." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the hinge}} {{of the film}} is a scene in an unusual late night theater called Club Silencio where a {{performer}} announces [...] "No hay banda (there is no band)... but yet we hear a band", variated between English, Spanish and French. Described as [...] "the most original and stunning sequence in an original and stunning film", Rebekah del Rio's Spanish a cappella rendition of [...] "Crying", named [...] "Llorando", is praised as [...] "show-stopping... except that there's no show to stop" [...] in the sparsely attended Club Silencio. Lynch wanted to use Roy Orbison's version of [...] "Crying" [...] in Blue Velvet, but changed his mind when he heard Orbison's [...] "In Dreams". Del Rio, who popularized the Spanish version and who received her first recording contract {{on the basis of the}} song, stated that Lynch flew to Nashville where she was living, and she sang the song for him once and did not know he was recording her. Lynch wrote a part for her in the film and used the version she sang for him in Nashville. The song tragically serenades the lovers Betty and Rita, who sit spellbound and weeping, moments before their relationship disappears and is replaced by Diane and Camilla's dysfunction. According to one film scholar, the song and the entire theater scene marks the disintegration of Betty's and Rita's personalities, as well as their relationship. With the use <b>of</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>languages</b> and a song to portray such primal emotions, one film analyst states that Lynch exhibits his distrust of intellectual discourse and chooses to make sense through images and sounds. The disorienting effect of the music playing although del Rio is no longer there is described as [...] "the musical version of Magritte's painting Ceci n'est pas une pipe".|$|E

50|$|Translanguaging is {{fundamentally}} different from codeswitching, because codeswitching does not occur naturally for multilingual students, but is a conscious process. Translanguaging {{is characterized by the}} unintentional integration <b>of</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>language</b> systems. This integration often cannot readily be restrained by a monolingual education system. Translanguaging is a more beneficial system than codeswitching because translanguaging could incite transfer of language skills across language systems, it increases the variety of pedagogical approaches language teachers have available to them in the classroom, and allows ideas to be far more comfortably transmitted from speaker to speaker, understood, and related across languages.|$|R
