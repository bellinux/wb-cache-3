40|$|Optical {{transition}} radiation (OTR) {{has proven to}} be a flexible and effective tool for measuring a wide range of beam parameters, in particular the beam divergence and the transverse beam profile. It is today an established and widely used diagnostic method providing linear real-time measurements. Measurements in the CLIC Test Facility (CTF 3) showed that the performance of the present profile monitors is limited by the <b>optical</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the imaging system. In this paper, two methods to improve the systems' performance are presented and results from measurements are shown. First, the influence of the surface quality of the OTR screen itself is addressed. Several possible screen materials have been tested to which different surface treatment techniques were applied. Results from the measured optical characteristics are given. Second, a parabolic-shaped screen support was investigated with the aim of providing an initial focusing of the emitted radiation and thus to reduce the problem of aperture limitation...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is the preparation and study of properties of polymer optical fibres. The {{first part of the}} thesis describes the complete process of making polymer optical fibres from a monomer using styrene as a reagent. A solid preform is obtained from the polymerization before being drawn into a fibre. Once obtained, the fibre is characterized in terms of its chemical (composition), <b>optical</b> (<b>acceptance</b> angle, attenuation, refractive index profile), physical (elongation-to-break) and spectroscopic (Infrared, Raman, NMR) properties. Polarized Raman spectroscopy is employed to analyse the conformation of the polymer molecules in the fibre. The results of the spectroscopic studies show an axial symmetry around the main axis of the fibre. Symmetry is created when the fibre is drawn. In {{the second part of the}} project, styrene is copolymerized with glycidyl methacrylate. The latter has an epoxy group on its side chain that can be polymerized independently from the vinyl group.

40|$|Visual {{fields and}} ommatidial angles of the {{compound}} eyes of Mantispa styriaca were determined using luminous pseudopupil and histological-anatomical tech-niques. The maximal horizontal overlap averaged 42. 7 ° in females and 52. 4 ° in males; females had only one overlap maximum, whereas males had two. In the dorsoventral direction, the binocular field had an overlap of 135. 2 ° in the female and 142 ° in the male. In light-adapted eyes, <b>optical</b> <b>acceptance</b> angles reached values of 2. 0 °, and they reached 3. 6 ° with dark adaptation; interommatidial angles were between 1. 8 ° and 2. 3 °. The angles were very similar over the entire eye; no acute zone {{was found in the}} frontal part of the eye, as the large binocular overlap would suggest. The results are compared with those for the praying mantis: this animal is in no way related to Mantispa but resembles it in appearance and capture behaviour...|$|E

40|$|In high concentrating {{photovoltaic}} (HCPV) modules {{the solar}} radiation {{is focused on}} high efficient multi-junction solar cells. One option to distinguish between different system approaches is the applied optics. For example, Frensel lenses or parabolic mirrors {{can be used as}} primary optics. Another aspect of the module design is how the thermal energy is distributed. There are actively and passively cooled systems. In any case, the way of thermal management is essential for the high performance of the system. In this paper passively cooled systems with mirrors as primary optics are investigated. Different designs of modules with on-axis, off-axis and Cassegrain optics were chosen and evaluated in terms of thermal management, <b>optical</b> efficiency, <b>acceptance</b> angle and manufacturing efforts. For the analysis of the optical and thermal behavior, ray tracing and FEM simulations were applied. In terms of temperature of the solar cell the Cassegrain design has the lowest operating temperature as the heat spreader does not shade the primary optics and can be generously dimensioned. Comparing the acceptance angle and the optical efficiency a special on-axis design with the heat spreader assembled inside of the module performs best...|$|R
40|$|Concentrating {{photovoltaic}} (CPV) {{systems are}} a key step in expanding the use of solar energy. Solar cells can operate at increased efficiencies under higher solar concentration and replacing solar cells with optical devices to capture light is an effective method of decreasing {{the cost of a}} system without compromising the amount of solar energy absorbed. CPV systems are however still in a stage of development where new designs, methods and materials are still being created in order to reach a low levelled cost of energy comparable to standard silicon based photovoltaic (PV) systems. This work outlines the different types of concentration photovoltaic systems, their various design advantages and limitations, and noticeable trends. Comparisons on materials, optical efficiency and <b>optical</b> tolerance (<b>acceptance</b> angle) are made in the literature review as well as during theoretical and experimental investigations. The subject of surface structure and its implications on concentrator optics has been discussed in detail while highlighting the need for enhanced considerations towards material and hence the surface quality of optics.

Consequently, this manuscript presents a novel tolerant and cost effective concentrator optic: the domed-shaped Fresnel-Köhler, presenting a curved Fresnel lens as Primary Optical Element (POE). This concentrator is based on two previous successful CPV designs: the FK concentrator, based on a flat Fresnel lens, and the dome-shaped Fresnel lens system developed by Daido Steel, resulting on a superior concentrator.

The effect of parabolic curvatures, reflector separation distance and the homogeniser’s height and width on the acceptance angle has been investigated for optimisation. Simulated optical efficiencies of 84. 82 – 81. 89 % over a range of ± 1 ° tracking error and 55. 49 % at a tracking error of ± 1. 5 ° were obtained. The final singular module measures 169 mm in height and 230 mm in width (not including structural components such as cover glass). The primary reflector dish has a focal length of 200 mm and is a focal with the secondary inverse reflector which has a focal length of 70 mm. The transparent homogenising optic has a height of 70 mm, an entry aperture of 30 × 30 mm and an output aperture of 10 × 10 mm to match the solar cell.

40|$|Abstract—We {{report on}} the design, construction, and initial {{performance}} measurements of a low-concentration photovoltaic system based on compound parabolic concentrators (CPCs). The system is approximately a 7 × concentration system and uses com-mercially available laser groove buried contact monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic cells. The CPCs are fabricated using a second-surface aluminized acrylic mirror with proven weather durability. The asymmetric CPC optical design was driven by a balance be-tween concentration factor, thermal issues, and <b>optical</b> angle of <b>acceptance</b> and was thoroughly evaluated by optical ray tracing. The design was targeted for a single-axis tracking system, with ex-truded aluminum heat sinks doubling as structural components. We fabricated a 120 -cell (10 × 12) prototype array, and over three months of operation, we estimated an approximate peak total sys-tem power efficiency of 7. 9 %, limited mostly by the CPC optical efficiency (∼ 55 %) and the cell conversion efficiency. We discuss several issues regarding system performance, reliability, and cost.

40|$|Recent advancements in the {{development}} of high-efficiency multijunction solar cells have led to a renewed interest in the design and implementation of high concentration photovoltaic systems. With the emergence of novel materials and design structures, understanding the operation of multijunction solar cells has become a challenging task. Modeling and simulation hence {{play an important role in}} the analysis of such devices. In this dissertation, techniques for accurate optoelectrical modeling of concentrating photovoltaic systems, based on multijunction solar cells, are proposed. A 2 -dimensional, distributed circuit model is proposed, parametrized to values obtained by numerical modeling of three multijunction cell designs, namely: a three-junction, lattice matched design, a three-junction lattice-mismatched, inverted metamorphic design, and a four-junction,lattice matched design. Cell performance for all the three designs is evaluated under both uniform and nonuniform illumination profiles at high concentrations and efficiency enhancement by optimizing finger spacing is proposed. The effect of luminescent coupling from higher bandgap subcells is also determined. Fresnel-lens based, refractive concentrating optical systems are modeled and optimized using an optical ray-tracing simulator at two different concentrations, with and without a secondary optical element. The corresponding <b>optical</b> efficiency, <b>acceptance</b> angle, and the degree of nonuniformity are determined for each optical system. An integrated approach,combining optical design with electrical modeling is proposed for optimizing the multijunction solar cell in tandem with the corresponding concentrating optics. The approach is validated by on-sun, acceptance angle measurements, using a three-junction,lattice-matched cell. Also, temperature effects are modeled and are experimentally validated for a three-junction, lattice-matched design. Experimental results with a single-junction, dilute-nitride cell, targeted for four-junction operation, are presented as well. A modified distributed circuit model is used for analysis of temperature effects in a four-junction solar cell, and the results under both uniform and nonuniform temperature profiles are presented. When implemented, the designs and their corresponding analyses, may result in new insights into {{the development}} of CPV systems, thereby enabling enhanced efficiencies at higher concentrations...|$|R
