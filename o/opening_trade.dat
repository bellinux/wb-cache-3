This result is {{consistent}} with the market power hypothesis which suggests that the specialists use their informational advantage about the order imbalance at the open or take advantage of the inelastic demand at the open by imposing wider spreads. We also find that the transparent opening mechanisms of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) enable them to facilitate greater price discovery at the opening and to have more efficient opening prices. This result implies that the transparency effect dominates the market power effect. Further, we find that peripheral markets do not passively free ride on information revealed through the AMEX because their <b>opening</b> <b>trades</b> contribute significantly to the price discovery process.

In 1783, storms drove a Japanese sea captain, Daikokuya Kōdayū, ashore in the Aleutian Islands, at that time Russian territory.

Subsequently, in 1792, the Russian government dispatched a trade mission to Japan, led by Adam Laxman. The Tokugawa shogunate received the mission, but negotiations failed.|$|E

For turnover rate, <b>opening</b> margin <b>trading</b> can increase the TSE's turnover rate significantly. The result also shows that considering both sectors and firm sizes, they still have different turnover rates in the mid- and long-term. In addition, <b>opening</b> margin <b>trading</b> does have information content on the stock returns. During the event window, the electric sectors of both TSE and OTC have higher stock returns. All sectors except the OTC's non-electric sector have positive impacts by <b>opening</b> margin <b>trading.</b> It follows from what has been said that the TSE's electric sector is a better investment target during our sample period and its CAAR increases more in the bull market than in the bear market. margin trading, abnormal return, volatility, turnover rate...|$|R

This kind of price behavior seems to contradict stock market efficiency.

25|$|While {{military}} action suppressed the pirates, {{a change in}} Ming maritime policy allowing overseas trade was instrumental in keeping them from rising again. As early as 1530, the maritime prohibitions had in fact been lifted in the southern coastal province of Guangdong, where non-tribute trade were taxed. Provincial authorities had hoped that by <b>opening</b> <b>trade,</b> the economically marginalized of Guangdong would have legitimate livelihoods and would not need to descend into piracy. Indeed, Guangdong was spared from {{the brunt of the}} pirate raids during the peak years of wokou activity, and those who had invaded Guangdong were put down with relative ease. In 1554, the provincial authorities entered into an historic agreement with the Portuguese — who came back to Guangdong after their misfortunes at Zhejiang and Fujian — where the Portuguese would be allowed to settle in Macau and trade in Guangzhou for an annual fee. The Portuguese would thence help the Ming destroy pirate fleets in the area, for which they were eventually rewarded with the imperial acknowledgement of their occupation of Macau by the Wanli Emperor (r. 1563-1620). This occupation lasted all the way until 1999, when Macau was handed over to the People's Republic of China.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the pervasiveness}} of {{international}} trade, the effects of <b>trade</b> <b>opening</b> on the psyche have received scant attention. We present three hypotheses about the likely effects of <b>trade</b> <b>opening</b> on the following five dimensions of the psyche: mirth (smiles), anger, addiction, stress, and regret. To test the hypotheses we use a survey of ~ 605 people [greater-or-equal, slanted] 16  years of age from a highly autarkic native Amazonian society of foragers and farmers in Bolivia (Tsimane') {{with high levels of}} impulsivity. As explanatory variables we use four measures of <b>trade</b> <b>opening</b> and a wide range of controls. Regret at buying durable assets during the previous year and addiction bore a positive association with two measures of trade opening: monetary income in the last 2 weeks and outstanding monetary debts owed to one or owed {{to the rest of the}} world. International trade theory predicts that <b>trade</b> <b>opening</b> expands choices in consumption, but among impulsive people in a highly autarkic society, more choice can beget more addiction and buyer's regret. We found no association between <b>trade</b> <b>opening</b> and smiles, anger, or stress, consistent with recent findings from industrial societies suggesting weak or ambiguous links between monetary income and these indicators of subjective well-being.

This kind of price behaviour seems to contradict stock market efficiency, and may be potentially interpreted as stock price ‘corrections’ following their ‘deviations’ from the underlying values caused by noise trading during the continuous trading sessions. Based on this finding, for the sampling period, I construct two different daily-adjusted investment portfolios based on the <b>opening</b> <b>trading</b> sessions and involving a long position in the stocks on the days when their opening returns are expected to be high and a short position in the stocks on the days when their opening returns are expected to be low.
