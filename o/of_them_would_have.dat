5|$|The good {{understanding}} between the patroons of the Amsterdam Chamber left {{nothing to be}} desired; Burgh, Godyn, Blommaert, and Van Rensselaer, before signifying to the directors their willingness to start colonies, made an agreement to work the projected colonies on joint account, each {{under the direction of}} one of them. Three <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a one-fifth share in each colony, while the fourth would receive the remaining two fifths, taking the responsibility for its management and exercising patroon rights.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Ti'ana {{takes place}} earlier than The Book of Atrus. The {{first part of}} the book focuses on life of Atrus' {{grandfather}} Aitrus with his parents Kahlis and Tasera, Aitrus' meeting with Ti'ana, and the birth of their son Gehn. The book also explains the destruction of the D'ni civilization. Two D'ni, Veovis and A'Gaeris, plot to destroy their civilization, which they believe has been corrupted. Veovis and A'Gaeris create a plague which wipes out many of the D'ni and follows them through the Ages. Veovis is murdered by A'Gaeris for refusing to write an Age where the two <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been worshipped as gods, and Aitrus sacrifices himself in order to lure A'Gaeris to an unstable Age, killing them both.|$|E

5|$|Such densities are {{possible}} because white dwarf material is not composed of atoms joined by chemical bonds, but rather {{consists of a}} plasma of unbound nuclei and electrons. There is therefore no obstacle to placing nuclei closer than normally allowed by electron orbitals limited by normal matter. Eddington wondered what would happen when this plasma cooled and the energy to keep the atoms ionized was no longer sufficient. This paradox was resolved by R. H. Fowler in 1926 by an application of the newly devised quantum mechanics. Since electrons obey the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons can occupy the same state, and they must obey Fermi–Dirac statistics, also introduced in 1926 to determine the statistical distribution of particles which satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle. At zero temperature, therefore, electrons can not all occupy the lowest-energy, or ground, state; some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to occupy higher-energy states, forming a band of lowest-available energy states, the Fermi sea. This state of the electrons, called degenerate, meant that a white dwarf could cool to zero temperature and still possess high energy.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in the County Championship, Lancashire {{assumed the}} {{ascendancy}} of Division Two with an eight-wicket win over Essex which also secured their return to Division One after only one season on the lowest rung of the Championship ladder. National League losses for Worcestershire Royals and Hampshire Hawks then left four teams on 22 points {{in the bottom of}} Division One – three <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to go down.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} {{physicians}} who reported having made a mistake, it was offered that disclosing to non-physician sources of support may reduce stress more than disclosing to physician colleagues.

It is possible that greater benefit occurs when spouses are physicians.|$|E

A defeat on any <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> forced an election. But in the end, there was no repeat of the single-vote squeaker win of May 19. The closest vote passed 153 to 149; Gurmant Grewal is on stress leave over the tape scandal, two other conservative MPs are sick with cancer, and Thibault from the BQ is away due to the passing away of her father. As well, a series of public opinion polls released just days earlier all showed the Liberals in the lead, one of them released {{just a week ago}} showing the Liberals have a 14% lead over the Tories.

25|$|The {{first floor}} {{is where the}} Great Hall with its large vaulted ceiling is situated. The Great Hall was mainly used for grand banquets and {{entertainment}} for the lord and his guests. Guests staying at the castle would have also slept {{on the floor of}} the Great Hall. The Hall also served as a court as the lord would act as a judge passing verdicts and sentences for crimes committed in the surrounding area. The first floor also has a minstrel's gallery where a group of travelling minstrels would play instruments and act for the Lord and Lady sitting below. Off the minstrel's gallery is the minstrels changing room, where the travelling players would change into their bright costumes. This room would also have been used by the minstrels to sleep in; the reason for them having their own private quarters was that it was feared that many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been carrying disease. They slept here to stop them passing any ailments on to other guests. The guard room also sits on the first floor. The guard room has the only access to the dungeon in the castle, a small hole in the floor where prisoners were thrown in. A guard would always be present in this room to both guard the dungeon but also the only entrance to the castle, a small door above ground level, which is next to the guard room.|$|E

25|$|England {{now had to}} win {{the final}} three Tests {{if they wanted to}} regain the Ashes, for which the only {{precedent}} was when Don Bradman made three big centuries in the 1936–37 Ashes series to win 3–2 after being 2–0 down to Gubby Allen's England side. Sydney is a famous spinning wicket, though the three tour matches the MCC had seen lots of runs for few wickets. In the New South Wales game immediately before the Third Test they had made 553/8 with Len Hutton making 150 and Reg Simpson 259 and the fast-medium bowler John Warr took 4/67. As a result the unhappy Brian Close was dropped in favour of Warr, making his debut, and England went into the Test with Doug Wright as the only specialist spinner, supported by the part-time spin of Freddie Brown and Denis Compton. The leg-spinner Eric Hollies had taken 5 wickets (78.60) in his three games at the Sydney Cricket Ground and off-spinner Bob Berry was going for 4 runs an over in his containment role and were not chosen. Denis Compton was fit again and replaced the ailing John Dewes, but Gilbert Parkhouse stayed in the team thanks to his fighting 28 at Melbourne and 92 against New South Wales. Australia kept the same team from the Second Test, though if they had lost the performances of a few <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> resulted in their being dropped. For the only time in Lindsay Hassett's career as captain he lost the toss in an Ashes Test and Freddie Brown was able to bat first on another flat batting track.|$|E
500|$|Three of {{the four}} bullets that struck Lennon's back passed {{completely}} through his body {{and out of his}} chest, one of which hit and became lodged in his upper left arm, while the fourth lodged itself in his aorta beside his heart; nearly all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been fatal by themselves as each bullet hit vital arteries around the heart. As Lennon had been shot four times at close range with hollow-point bullets, Lennon's affected organs (particularly his left lung) and major blood vessels above his heart were virtually destroyed upon impact. Lynn later stated to reporters on the extent of Lennon's injuries: [...] "If he [...] had been shot this way {{in the middle of the}} operating room with a whole team of surgeons ready to work on him... he still wouldn't have survived his injuries".|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Original Soundtrack {{was well}} received; Daniel Space of RPGFan praised it, saying that [...] "the music is fun, {{extremely}} well written and interesting to hear". He enjoyed the alternative instruments {{used in the}} tunes, calling them [...] "successful in providing imagery of renaissance times", although he felt that much more <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> begun to drag the soundtrack down. Chris of Square Enix Music Online also enjoyed the soundtrack, although he noted that it was [...] "not for everyone". He did, however, feel that the constant use of Renaissance-themed music resulted in a [...] "lack of diversity of styles" [...] that made several of the tracks [...] "bland and indistinctive". Jared of Square Enix Music Online was more enthusiastic about the soundtrack, terming it [...] "a stunning soundtrack full of feeling and emotion" [...] and praising its [...] "unique" [...] style. [...] As a promotional album, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles - A Musical Journey was not as noted by critics. Jared {{felt that it was}} [...] "a decent look into the soundtrack of Crystal Chronicles", but not as good of a sampler disc as it could have been due to the track selection.|$|E

500|$|As a {{predominantly}} Gaelic society, most Scottish cultural practices throughout this period mirrored closely those of Ireland, {{or at least}} those of Ireland with some Pictish borrowings. After David I, the French-speaking kings introduced cultural practices popular in Anglo-Norman England, France and elsewhere. As in all pre-modern societies, storytelling was popular. The English scholar D. D. R. Owen, who specialises {{in the literature of}} this era, writes that [...] "Professional storytellers would ply their trade from court to court. Some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been native Scots, no doubt offering legends from the ancient Celtic past performed ... in Gaelic when appropriate, but in French for most of the new nobility". Almost all of these stories are lost, although some have come down in the Gaelic or Scots oral tradition. One form of oral culture extremely well accounted for in this period is genealogy. There are dozens of Scottish genealogies surviving from this era, covering everyone from the Mormaers of Lennox and Moray to the Scottish king himself. Scotland's kings maintained an ollamh righe, a royal high poet who had a permanent place in all medieval Gaelic lordships, and whose purpose was to recite genealogies when needed, for occasions such as coronations.|$|E

2500|$|As {{of the mid}} 20th century, no {{word was}} used to {{describe}} the ideological outlook of this group of thinkers.

The term [...] "liberal" [...] had ceased to refer to the support of individual rights and minimal government, and instead came to denote left wing ideas that would be seen elsewhere as socialist or democratic socialism. American advocates of freedom bemoaned the loss of the word, and cast about for others to replace it. The word [...] "conservative" [...] (later associated with libertarianism either through fiscal conservatism or through fusionism) had yet to emerge: Russell Kirk's The Conservative Mind was not published until 1953 and this work hardly mentioned economics at all.|$|E

2500|$|A {{committee}} {{established by}} the British in 1939 to clarify the various arguments observed that many commitments had been made {{during and after the}} war - and that all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to be studied together. The Arab representatives submitted a statement to the committee from Sir Michael McDonnell which explained that whatever McMahon had intended to mean was of no legal consequence, since it was his actual statements that constituted the pledge from His Majesty's Government. The Arab representatives also pointed out that McMahon had been acting as an intermediary for the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Grey. Speaking in the House of Lords on 27 March 1923, Lord Grey had made it clear that, for his part, he entertained serious doubts as to the validity of the Churchill White Paper's interpretation of the pledges which he, as Foreign Secretary, had caused to be given to the Sharif Husain in 1915.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was a great}} character. According to E.W. Swanton, [...] "He {{always had}} a few pet bees buzzing around in his bonnet, and used to inveigh against the {{criminal}} folly of selectors and authority generally if their view did not match his own." [...] When Maurice Leyland was preferred to Frank Woolley in the touring party to Australia in 1928-9, he fulminated against {{the selection of a}} [...] "cross-batted village-greener". When he scored 63* in the 1892 University Match, three of the best Cambridge batsmen were run out during his innings, including no less a figure than F.S. Jackson, his captain. When it appeared that one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to go, Weigall is supposed to have sacrificed his partner by calling: [...] "Get back, Jacker. I'm set." [...] Swanton sums him up thus: [...] "... he may well sound a rather preposterous fellow... I can only say that every cricketer was his friend, and that he never spoke an unkind word about anyone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unsurprisingly, lower order {{partnerships}} {{are usually}} {{much smaller than}} those for the early wickets, but are often the most tactically intense. A lot of spectator enjoyment derives either from the frequent combination of a last recognised batsman adopting extremely aggressive play (in an effort to score as many runs as possible before he runs out of batting partners - one reason why aggressive batsmen like Andrew Flintoff and Adam Gilchrist are often deliberately placed relatively low in the batting order) and the constant risk of a wicket, the alternative situation where no recognised batsmen remains and the tail-enders (relieved of their responsibility to bat carefully for anybody else) often unleash their rarely seen arsenal of attacking shots, or alternatively the extremely tense situation which sometimes emerges {{towards the end of}} a match when a batting side, facing defeat, can only salvage a draw and save the match by batting {{to the end of the}} final day, which becomes difficult once the worst batsmen are in, and their survival is always nerve-wracking [...] English fans fondly remember the last wicket stand of Angus Fraser and Robert Croft, batting out the last few overs of the drawn Third Test against South Africa at Old Trafford in 1998, when the dismissal of either <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> resulted in a loss.
