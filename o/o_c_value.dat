During 0. 4 s simulation cycle, it shows better atomize results and better homogeneity. The reaction temperature on catalyst is kept at 319 <b>o</b> <b>C</b> <b>value</b> which is helpful for continuous SCR reaction.

40|$|Melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is {{accelerating}} {{and will}} {{contribute significantly to}} global sea level rise during the 21 st century. Instrumental data on GrIS melting only cover the last few decades, and proxy data extending our knowledge into the past are vital for validating models predicting the influence of ongoing climate change. We investigated a potential meltwater proxy in Godthåbsfjord (West Greenland), where glacier meltwater causes seasonal excursions with lower oxygen isotope water (δ 18 O w) values and salinity. The blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) potentially records these variations, because it precipitates its shell calcite in oxygen isotopic equilibrium with ambient seawater. As M. edulis shells are known to occur in raised shorelines and archaeological shell middens from previous Holocene warm periods, this species may be ideal in reconstructing past meltwater dynamics. We investigate its potential as a palaeo-meltwater proxy. First, we confirmed that M. edulis shell calcite oxygen isotope (δ 18 <b>O</b> <b>c)</b> <b>values</b> are in equilibrium with ambient water and generally reflect meltwater conditions. Subsequently we investigated if this species recorded {{the full range of}} δ 18 O w values occurring during the years 2007 to 2010.

40|$|A sub-centennial-resolution {{record of}} {{lacustrine}} carbonate oxygen isotopes (δ 18 <b>O</b> <b>C)</b> from the closed-basin Lake Qinghai on the NE Tibetan Plateau shows pronounced variability {{over the past}} 1500 years. Changes in δ 18 <b>O</b> <b>C</b> in hydrologically closed lakes are often interpreted in terms of changing effective moisture. Under this interpretation our record would imply increasing effective moisture during the Little Ice Age (LIA) compared to the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). However, independent evidence from other archives strongly suggests the Asian summer monsoon was stronger during the MWP and weakened during the LIA. Controls other than effective moisture (the balance of water inputs over evaporative loss) must therefore {{have contributed to the}} δ 18 <b>O</b> <b>C</b> <b>values.</b> We propose the LIA signal in Lake Qinghai resulted from a reduction in evaporation caused by colder air temperatures, coupled with a decrease in oxygen isotope composition of input waters {{as a result of an}} increase in the relative importance of westerly-derived precipitation. Our results caution against simplistic interpretations of carbonate oxygen isotope records from hydrologically closed lakes and suggest all possible controlling factors must be taken into account in order to avoid misleading palaeoclimatic reconstructions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. - In this study, {{petrographic}} {{and organic}} geochemical {{characteristics of the}} Tertiary Karlıova-Halifan coals (Bingöl) were investigated. Determination of coal quality was based on chemical (moisture, volatile matter, fixed carbon, ash) and elemental analyses (<b>C,</b> H, <b>O,</b> S, N). The values of the huminite reflectances in organic mat-ter-rich coal levels change between 0. 368 and 0. 573 %, which correspond to low maturity levels. These param-eters are in good aggrement with their fluorescence colors, calorific value (average original- 2266, dry- 3177 Kcal/kg, upper calorific value) and average Tmax (417 <b>o</b> <b>C)</b> <b>values.</b> The organic material in studied coals show low grade transformation due to low lithostatic pressure. Therefore, the petrographic characteristics and quality values of Karlıova Halifan coals suggest classification as sub-bituminous coal – Lignite. Rock Eval analysis results point to an immature to early mature hydrocarbon generation for hydrocarbon derivatives formed by type II/III and III kero-gen with average Tmax <b>values</b> of 417 <b>o</b> <b>C.</b> The coals mainly constitute huminites, with small amounts of inertinite and liptinite type macerals.

40|$|The {{northwest}} {{coast of}} Bohai Bay supports {{large areas of}} Holocene Crassostrea gigas (oyster) reefs. Their huge size {{and the fact that}} the shells are composed of consecutive microgrowth layers, consisting of primary calcite, make them an ideal object for a stable isotope study. The delta(18) <b>O</b> and delta(13) <b>C</b> compositions of the oysters reveal a number of interesting features. The most important are annual cycles related to seasonal variations, the regional delta(18) O (water) versus salinity ratio, and a stop in shell secretion below a water temperature of 11. 5 +/- 1. 5 degrees C. A positive correlation (covariance) between delta(18) <b>O</b> and delta(13) <b>C</b> <b>values</b> is present in most specimens. The delta(18) <b>O</b> and delta(13) <b>C</b> <b>values</b> of single specimens are believed to be mainly controlled by water temperature and the occurrence of phytoplankton blooms and decomposition. However, correlation among oysters of different ages indicate that the delta(18) <b>O</b> and delta(13) <b>C</b> <b>values</b> are mainly dependant of three variables: water temperature, salinity and phytoplankton blooms/decomposition. Between ca. 6500 yrs cal B. P. and 2300 yrs cal B. P. the salinity in Bohai Bay increased from less than 20 parts per thousand to 30 parts per thousand. Based on geological data combined with ecological data from C. gigas, we suggest that precipitation decreased during this period, while the input of fluvial sediments increased. The sediment load of rivers increased markedly after ca. 4000 yrs cal B. P., possibly due to a change in climate. In our study area this resulted in the development of the Oyster Plain...|$|R
40|$|Stable {{oxygen and}} carbon isotope (? 18 <b>O</b> and ? 13 <b>C)</b> <b>values</b> {{measured}} in foraminiferal calcite {{are one of}} the primary tools used in paleoceanography. Diagenetic recrystallization of foraminiferal calcite can act to reset primary isotopic values, but its effects are typically poorly quantified. Here we test the impact of early stage diagenesis on stable isotope records generated from a suite of drill sites in the equatorial Pacific Ocean recovered during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 199 and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 320. Our selected sites form paleowater and burial depth transects, with excellent stratigraphic control allowing us to confidently correlate our records. We observe large intersite differences in the preservation state of benthic foraminiferal calcite, implying very different recrystallization histories, but negligible intersite offsets in benthic ? 18 <b>O</b> and ? 13 <b>C</b> <b>values.</b> We infer that diagenetic alteration of benthic foraminiferal calcite (in sedimentary oozes) must predominantly occur at shallow burial depths (< 100 ?m) where offsets in both the temperature and isotopic composition of waters in which the foraminifera calcified and pore waters in which diagenesis occurs are small. Our results suggest that even extensive recrystallization of benthic foraminiferal calcite results in minimal shifts from primary ? 18 <b>O</b> and ? 13 <b>C</b> <b>values.</b> This finding supports the long-held suspicion that diagenetic alteration of foraminiferal calcite is less problematic in benthic than in planktic foraminifera and that in deep-sea sediments routinely employed for paleoceanographic studies benthic foraminifera are robust recorders of stable isotope values in the fossil record...|$|R

As far as the trace elements are concerned, Ag enriches the produced lime, whereas none of these elements shows organic affinity. The trace elements Ba, La, Sc, Sm, Sr, U, V, Y and Zr show intermediate affinity. Many other elements were determined and remain under the detection limit almost under any calcination condition. It is concluded that the calcination conditions do not affect the elements behaviour. As far as the technological characteristics are concerned the examined limestones have an average dry apparent weight of 2. 6 g/cm 3. During the cubic samples calcination with an average edge of 1 cm, the calcination is completed at around 1, 000 <b>o</b> <b>C</b> and the dry apparent weight gets an average value of 1. 4 g/cm 3. The retention for a longer period of time in that temperature or the exposure to greater temperatures causes increase of the dry apparent weight that is shrinkage phenomena in cubic samples. Indeed, for calcination temperature of 1, 150 <b>o</b> <b>C,</b> <b>values</b> of dry apparent weight were counted up to 1. 7 g/cm 3. In cubic samples of mean edge of 2 and 4 cm, proportionate phenomena are being observed but not so intense. On the other hand, in cubic samples of mean edge of 6 and 8 cm the calcination progress is more normal and a lower value of the dry apparent weight is achieved in greater temperatures. It is noted then, that the quality of the produced lime from a given limestone does not only depend on the calcination conditions, but also on the limestone fragments size that will be calcined. ...|$|R

In an attempt to compare and correlate the results of experiments with B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D., the author carried out tests on both B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. of the organic matter contained in the samples of sea water, river water, sewage and night soil. The results are summarized as follows : (1) Both B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. of the samples of river water obtained at low tide were higher than those of the samples obtained at high tide. At both low and high tides, the samples of the surface water of a river showed higher B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. <b>values</b> than those of the water obtained from its bottom. It appeared that a slight shower caused B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. of river water to fall, a medium rainfall caused them to rise and prolonged rain lasting several days caused them to fall. (2) Like samples of river water, those of sea water showed higher B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. <b>values</b> at low tide than at high tide. (3) Tests for comparison of B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. of the samples of sewage and those of the 1 : 2 dilution of identical samples, both kept to stand at a room temperature, showed that the decrease of B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. and the decrease of the ratio B. <b>O.</b> D. / <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. were more marked in the latter than in the former. (4) It was shown that the degree of dilution of any samples of raw night soil and its supernatant paralleled the fall in the values of their B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. the rate of fall being a little smaller than the degree of dilution. (5) Tests in which samples of supernatant of night soil and their dilutions were kept standing at 30 ℃ and 37 ℃ in incubators showed that B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. of the samples kept at 37 ℃ fell earlier than those of the samples kept at 30 ℃. (6) It was shown that, from the standpoint of stochastics, there were significant differences between B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. in all the samples from river water, sea water, sewage and night soil. This indicates that there will be an agreement between the result of tests by chemical method of oxygen demand based on the use of KMnO_ 4 and the result of tests by biochemical method of determination of oxygen demand, if organic matters to be tested are of similar character...|$|R

40|$|Stable isotope and pollen {{data from}} Gölhisar Gölü, a small intramontane lake located in {{southwest}} Turkey, provide complementary records of Holocene climate change. Modern oxygen and hydrogen isotope water data {{are used as}} a means of comparing present-day isotope composition of the lake water to the past oxygen isotope composition of the lake water as calculated from 18 O/ 16 O ratios in calcite precipitated in the summer months. Despite the lake system being chemically dilute, the modern isotope data clearly establish that the lake water is evaporated in relation to its spring input, suggesting that the palaeo data can be interpreted primarily in terms of changing precipitation/evaporation ratios. 18 <b>O</b> and 13 <b>C</b> <b>values</b> from authigenic calcite through the Holocene show predominantly negative values indicating climatic conditions wetter than today. Particularly notable are low (depleted) isotope values during the earliest Holocene (ca. 10 600 - 8800 cal. yr. BP), a period for which pollen data imply drier conditions than at present. This divergence between pollen-inferred and stable isotope palaeoclimate data is found in other east Mediterranean lake sediment records, and suggests that vegetation may have taken several millennia to reach climatic equilibrium {{at the start of the}} Holocene. Isotopic fluctuations during the early-to-mid Holocene (8800 - 5100 cal. yr. BP) suggest oscillations between aridity and humidity. Higher 18 <b>O</b> and 13 <b>C</b> <b>values</b> for the second half of the Holocene indicate generally drier conditions than during the period before ca. 5100 cal. yr BP although there is some evidence for increased humidity coinciding with pollen evidence for increasing human impact and intensification of agriculture, notably during the so-called Beyehir Occupation Phase (Classical and early Byzantine periods). The modern trend towards aridity started about 1300 yr ago. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{most common}} fuel uses {{in the world}} is made from fossil. Fossil fuel is {{categorized}} as a non-renewable energy source. For that reason, there should be an alternative fuel to replace fossil fuel by using biodiesel and one of the stock comes from soybean bean. Before using the biodiesel made from soybean bean oil, there should be a research to find out the properties and the effect of biodiesel from soybean bean oil regarding the performance of the engine. The research can be conducted in experiment and simulation. The properties result of soybean oil biodiesel should be tested to confirm whether this biodiesel have meet the standard requirement of biodieselor not. This biodiesel sproperties are Flash Point <b>value</b> is 182 <b>o</b> <b>C,</b> Pour Point <b>value</b> is - 7 <b>o</b> <b>C,</b> Density at 15 <b>o</b> <b>C</b> is 890 Kg/m 3, Kinematic Viscosity at 40 <b>o</b> <b>C</b> is 5. 58 (cSt), and Lower Heating Value is 42. 27686 MJ/kg.

40|$|Six mature wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{plants from}} one crop were {{collected}} {{one week before}} harvest, and organs were separated as follows: culm, rachis, leaf sheaths, leaf blades and inflorescence bracts. Percentage silica (% SiO 2), % C, % N and 13 C were determined in these samples. Phytoliths isolated from the individual organs were subsequently analysed for 29 Si, 30 Si, and 18 O, as well as % C, % N and 13 C from occluded organic material within the phytoliths. Percentage silica was highest in the leaf sheaths and leaf blades and lower in the inflorescence bracts, culm and rachis. 30 Si and 29 Si were highly correlated, and both increased in the upper parts of the plant. It appears there are two routes for Si transport within the plant, and that heavier isotopes increase {{towards the end of}} both routes. The 18 O results indicate that the culm and the leaf blades were the sites of highest 18 O, with lower values in the rachis, leaf sheath and inflorescence. There was no correlation between the accumulation of either heavy silicon isotope (29 Si and 30 Si) and heavy oxygen accumulation (18 <b>O).</b> 13 <b>C</b> <b>values</b> were typical of C 3 species, and whole plant and isolated phytolith values were similar.

40|$|Lake Neuchatel is {{a medium}} sized, hard-water lake, lacking varved sediments, {{situated}} in the western Swiss Lowlands {{at the foot of}} the Jura Mountains. Stable isotope data (delta(18) <b>O</b> and delta(13) <b>C)</b> from both bulk carbonate and ostracode calcite in an 81 cm long, radiocarbon-dated sediment core represent the last 1500 years of Lake Neuchatel's environmental history. Comparison between this isotopic and other palaeolimnologic data (mineralogical, geochemical, palynological, etc.) helps to differentiate between anthropogenic and natural factors most recently affecting the lake. An increase in lacustrine productivity (450 - 650 AD ca), inferred from the positive trend in delta(13) <b>C</b> <b>values</b> of bulk carbonate, is related to medieval forest clearances and the associated nutrient budget changes. A negative trend in both the bulk carbonate and ostracode calcite delta(18) O values between approximately 1300 and 1500 AD, is tentatively interpreted as due to a cooling in mean air temperature at the transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. Negative trends in bulk carbonate delta(18) <b>O</b> and delta(13) <b>C</b> <b>values</b> through the uppermost sediments, which have no equivalent in ostracode calcite isotopic values, are concomitant with the recent onset of eutrophication in the lake. Isotopic disequilibrium during calcite precipitation, probably due to kinetic factors in periods of high productivity is postulated as the mechanism to explain the associated negative isotopic trends, although the effect of a shift of the calcite precipitation towards the warmer months cannot be excluded...|$|R

This {{study was conducted to}} intentionally induce a red/bloody appearance in fully-cooked chicken to create a model for studying methods to control this defect. Five trials were conducted using bony marrow (harvested from the interior of epiphyseal end caps) from either fresh femurs (three trials) or frozen femurs (two trials) that were prepared and placed in contact with chopped broiler breast meat. Meat and marrow were packed into glass tubes and heated to one of three endpoint temperatures (74, 79, or 85 <b>o</b> <b>C).</b> Five replicate tubes were prepared for each endpoint temperature in each trial (n = 75). After cooking and immediate cooling, CIE lightness (L*) and redness (a*) was determined for both the surface of the meat adjacent to the bony marrow and the surface of the marrow. The surfaces of the meat from samples prepared with fresh marrow were darker (lower L* values) and redder (higher a* values) than control meat surface samples.
