40|$|Sway was {{examined}} during standing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rotating <b>platform.</b> Sway increased significantly when standing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> firm rotating <b>platform</b> and increased further if standing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> compliant rotating <b>platform.</b> Medio-lateral (ML) sway {{was smaller than}} anterio-posterior (AP) sway when not rotating. When rotating, ML sway increased to similar levels as AP sway. Findings suggested that vestibular feedback is significantly impaired when the body is rotating. Conclusions Sway is increased when standing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rotating <b>platform,</b> with the greatest increase seen in ML sway, mostly due to impaired vestibular sensory function...|$|R

5|$|Gay activists, newly {{alarmed at}} {{the threat to}} their rights, confronted vice {{president}} Walter Mondale at a political rally in San Francisco {{two weeks after the}} announcement of Proposition 6.

When gay activists interrupted him and demanded he address their issues, he quickly left without a response, and San Francisco Democratic organizers and liberal politicians were furious at the gay activists.|$|E

5|$|Initially, this protest did not {{attract a}} great deal of attention, and even the IRA {{regarded}} it as a side-issue compared to their armed campaign. It began to attract attention when Tomás Ó Fiaich, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, visited the prison and condemned the conditions there. In 1979, former MP Bernadette McAliskey stood in the election for the European Parliament <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> of support for the protesting prisoners, and won 5.9% of the vote across Northern Ireland, even though Sinn Féin had called for a boycott of the election.|$|E

5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight {{to collide with}} enemies. The elevation of an enemy {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls toward the bottom of the screen, which a player can collect for points. An egg that sits <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> long enough will hatch into a new knight; if the player does not pick him up, he will gain a new mount and must be defeated again.|$|E
5|$|Solsticial {{alignments}} {{also can}} be seen as displays of power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the Island of the Sun (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in Lake Titicaca, the Sun was seen to rise at the June solstice between two towers on a nearby ridge. The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate that access to the sacred space was restricted to members of the Inca ruling elite. Ordinary pilgrims stood <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> outside the ceremonial area to see the solstice Sun rise between the towers.|$|E
