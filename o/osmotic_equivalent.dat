40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} external chloride on the typical swelling response induced in duck red cells by hypertonicity or norepinephrine. Lowering chloride inhibits swelling and produces concomitant changes in net movements of sodium and potassium in ouabain-treated cells, which resemble the effect of lowering external sodium or potassium. Inhibition is the same whether chloride is replaced with gluconate or with an <b>osmotic</b> <b>equivalent</b> of sucrose. Since changes in external chloride also cause predictable changes in cell chloride, pH, and water, these variables were systematically investigated by varying external pH along with chloride. Lowering pH to 6. 60 does not abolish the response if external chloride levels are normal, although the cells are initially swollen due to the increased acidity. Cells deliberately preswollen in hypotonic solutions with appropriate ionic composition can also respond to norepinephrine by further swelling. These results rule out initial values of cell water, chloride, and pH as significant variables affecting the response. Initial values of the chloride equilibrium potential do have marked effect on the direction and rate of net water movement. If chloride is lowered by replacement with the permeant anion, acetate, E(Cl) is unchanged and a normal response to norepinephrine, which is inhibited by furosemide, is observed. Increasing internal sodium by the nystatin technique also inhibits the response. A theory is developed which depicts that the cotransport carrier proposed in the previous paper (W. F. Schmidt and T.

We compared the elemental composition of the field AMF {{to those of the}} soil and the associated plants. The spores and hyphae from the saline soils showed strongly elevated levels of Ca, Cl, Mg, Fe, Si, and K compared to their growth environment. In contrast, the spores of both the field-derived AMF and the in vitro grown G. intraradices contained lower or not elevated Na levels compared to their growth environment. This resulted in higher K:Na and Ca:Na ratios in spores than in soil, but lower than in the associated plants for the field AMF. The K:Na and Ca:Na ratios of G. intraradices grown in monoxenic cultures were also in the same range as those of the field AMF and did not change even when those ratios in the growth medium were lowered several orders of magnitude by adding NaCl. These results indicate that AMF can selectively take up elements such as K and Ca, which act as <b>osmotic</b> <b>equivalents</b> while they avoid uptake of toxic Na.

USA 73, 3433 - 3437] {{were the}} first to report that in hepatocytes {{isolated}} from fasted rats and incubated with either dihydroxyacetone, glucose or other sugars, glycogen synthesis was greatly accelerated by addition of amino acids. We have looked for possible mediators responsible for this effect and have tested the effect of alanine, proline, asparagine, glutamine or a combination of ammonia with either pyruvate or lactate in activating glycogen synthesis from dihydroxyacetone. The following observations were made. 1. Stimulation of glycogen synthesis by alanine, proline or asparagine does not require production of glutamine since the effect also occurs in periportal hepatocytes which lack glutamine synthetase. 2. Under various conditions, stimulation of glycogen synthesis by added amino acids directly correlated with increases in the intracellular content of amino acids, expressed in <b>osmotic</b> <b>equivalents.</b> 3. 3 -Mercaptopicolinic acid, the inhibitor of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, further enhances stimulation of glycogen synthesis by amino acids because it increases the intracellular accumulation of aspartate and glutamate. 4. The previously reported enhancement by leucine of the stimulation of glycogen synthesis by glutamine [Chen. K. S. & Lardy, H. A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14683 - 14688] can be ascribed to inhibition of urea synthesis by leucine which results in accumulation of glutamate and of ammonia, the essential activator of glutaminase. It is concluded that activation of glycogen synthesis by added amino acids is due to an increase in intracellular osmolarity following their uptake and the accumulation of intracellular catabolites. This results in an increase in hepatic volume which stimulates glycogen synthesis [Baquet, A., Hue, L., Meijer, A. J., van Woerkom, G. M. & Plomp, P. J. A. M. (1990) J. Biol.

When isolated with a two-phase partition system of aqueous polymers, the plasma membrane fractions of control, frozen, or hypertonically stressed leaves were of similar purity as judged by the distribution of marker enzyme activities.

In contrast, the specific ATPase activity of the plasma membrane fractions assayed in the absence of Triton X- 100 increased following freezing or hypertonic stress. As a result, the Triton X- 100 stimulation of the ATPase activity decreased significantly from sixfold in control leaves to threefold in lethally stressed leaves and reflects an increase in the permeability of the plasma membrane vesicles.

40|$|The {{signals that}} control the {{transcription}} of osmoregulated genes are not understood satisfactorily. The “turgor control model ” suggested that the primary osmoregulatory signal in Enterobacteriaceae is turgor loss, which induces the kdp K transport operon and activates the Trk K permease. The ensuing increase in cytoplasmic K concentration was proposed to be the signal that turns on all secondary responses, including the induction of the proU (proline-glycine betaine transport) operon. The “ionic strength model ” proposed that the regulatory signal for all osmotically controlled responses is {{the increase in the}} cytoplasmic ionic strength or macromolecular crowding after an osmotic upshift. The assumption in the turgor control model that the induction of kdp is a primary response to osmotic shock predicts that this response should precede all secondary responses. Both models predict that the induction of all osmotically activated responses should be independent of the chemical nature of the solute used to impose osmotic stress. We tested these predictions by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis of the expression of six osmotically regulated genes in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.

30|$|Salinity-induced osmotic stress reduces {{water uptake}} into plant roots. Plants {{regulate}} water transport under salinity stress because a sufficient {{amount of water}} is indispensable for the cells to maintain their growth and vital cellular functions such as photosynthesis and metabolisms. In the long distance water transport from roots to shoots, evaporation {{is one of the}} main motive forces for the water movement, especially in the apoplastic pathway. Salinity/osmotic stress directly (Yeo et al. [1985]) or indirectly via hormonal regulation (Jia et al. [2002]) induces a stomatal closure, which leads to a reduction in the evaporation and overall water transport. Along with the apoplastic pathway, symplastic and transcellular pathways are also important in water transport in plants. In these pathways, where the water is transported across the membrane, the water potential (Ψ) plays a central role in the driving force for the water movement. Although some theoretical issue regarding a biological cause of the water flux remains to be discussed (Kramer and Boyer [1985]), water flux is positively correlated with the product of water potential difference (ΔΨ) and hydraulic permeability (L p). In case of water uptake in root cells, ΔΨ is the difference between Ψ of extracellular solution and intracellular sap solution. Under non-stress condition, intracellular Ψ is generally more negative than that of the soil solution, resulting in water influx into roots according to the water potential gradient. The water potential (Ψ) is approximately consistent with the sum of the pressure potential (Ψp) and the <b>osmotic</b> potential (Ψosm, <b>equivalent</b> to the <b>osmotic</b> pressure of salt solution but with minus sign because they work in opposite direction).|$|R

The dehydration treatments resulted in biofilms comprised of smaller cells but they were taller and more porous, and had a thicker exopolysaccharide (EPS) layer at the air interface.

Carbohydrate composition analysis showed that alginate was a component of unsaturated biofilm EPS only in the presence of dehydration stress. The absence of alginate altered biofilm architecture in that biofilms were shorter, covered more surface area, and were less porous than when alginate was present. By measuring intracellular water potential changes and monitoring fatty acid alterations during dehydration stress, we demonstrated that alginate slows the rate of cellular dehydration. Alginate production also contributed to the ability of cells to survive a severe desiccation stress. These results suggest that an important consequence of cellular dehydration is alginate production, which contributes to the fitness of P. putida in water-limited environments.;Reduced water availability influenced the temporal and spatial localization of dead cells within unsaturated biofilms. Dead cells were organized in arrays of various lengths one cell width. In general, more dead cells were localized in the lower layers, while active, growing cells were localized primarily in the upper layers.;Taken together, reduction of water availability influences biofilm architecture, EPS production, and cell death patterns, which all reflect a status of adaptation of P. putida to dehydration stress.

40|$|ABSTRACT Intact living frogs (Rana pipiens) were {{partially}} {{immersed in}} dilute salt solution labeled with K 42 or Na 24 or, alternatively, injected with Ringer's fluid containing the appropriate isotope and then partially immersed in unlabeled dilute salt. Before isotopic equilibrium, {{the animals were}} sacrificed and specific activities of K 42 and Na 24 were determined for medium, skin, plasma, and other tissues. With Na 24, entering from the medium or escaping to the medium, specific activities of the skin approach that of the plasma. For K 42, entering from the medium, the specific activity exceeds that of the plasma. The results are interpreted as indicating that the exchange rate for Na is greater plasma to skin than medium to skin, with the reverse situation for K. Values are given for average Na, K, and CI contents of the various organ systems. Intact frogs sitting in pond water or dilute saline solutions will transfer Na and CI from the environment to the body against the considerable chemical gradient (seeKrogh, 1939). K and Ca, on the other hand, are not known to be transferred on a net basis, although studies on isotope exchange have not been reported extensively. The ability of the isolated frog skin to move ions and water has been clearly demonstrated {{over a period of}} several decades. Such studies, usually with high salt (Ringer's fluid or <b>equivalent</b> <b>osmotic</b> concentration) on both sides of the skin, may or may not have relevance to the physiological functioning of the skin in situ with the animal in a normal environment.

Germination then occurs in one flush of 2 - 3 weeks after about 5 months of winter dormancy {{during which time}} the seeds can remain in saline, often waterlogged soil. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of simulated natural conditions during dormancy on germination and to compare this with germination following the usual conditions of storing seeds dry. The effects of hydration, salinity, hypoxia and temperature regimes imposed during dormancy on germination were investigated. Also looked at were the effects of seed size on germination and the interaction between salinity during dormancy and salinity at the time of germination. Methods Various pre-treatments were imposed on samples of seeds that had been stored dry or wet for different periods of time during the 5 months of natural dormancy. Subsequent germination tests were carried out in conditions that simulated those found in the spring when germination occurs naturally. Various salinities were imposed at germination for a test of interaction between storage salinity and salinity at germination. Key Results A temperature of about 15 degrees C was needed for germination and large seeds germinated earlier and better than small seeds. Cold seawater pre-treatment was necessary for good germination; the longer the saline pre-treatment during the natural dormancy period the better the germination. There appeared to be no effect of any specific ion of the seawater pre-treatment on germination and severe hypoxia did not prevent good germination. A short period of freezing stimulated early germination in dry-stored seed. Storage in cold saline or <b>equivalent</b> <b>osmotic</b> medium appeared to inhibit germination during the natural dormancy period and predispose the seed to germinate when the temperature rose and the salinity fell. Seeds that were stored in cold wet conditions germinated better in saline conditions than those stored dry. Conclusions The conditions under which seeds of S. maritima are stored affect their subsequent germination. Under natural conditions seeds remain dormant in highly saline, anoxic mud and then germinate when the temperature rises above about 15 degrees C and the salinity is reduced...|$|R
40|$|This project investigates {{salinity}} {{effects on}} plants at single cell level. Increased cultivated land salt content in Australia and worldwide {{is a growing}} problem affecting food security. Characeae are ideal system for electrophysiological investigation because of large cells size, close relation to land plants and salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant species. Voltage clamp technique was employed to obtain current-voltage (I/V) characteristics, which were modelled by several transporters: HGSS model for proton pump, GHK model supplemented by Boltzmann distribution for high conductance K+ channels and in/outward rectifiers and an empirical equation for background current. To resolve salinity and turgor decrease responses the cells were exposed to a salinity step or an <b>equivalent</b> <b>osmotic</b> step by addition of sorbitol. The transporter responses in salt sensitive/tolerant species were followed and compared. The I/V profiles of the salt-tolerant characeae Lamprothamnium were measured in hypertonic challenge. Transient membrane hyperpolarization was observed for both turgor decrease and salinity increase. Modelling resolved activation of proton pump, increased background conductance (salinity step), and decrease in the half-activation potential of the inward rectifier. Under same osmotic stress salt-sensitive Chara cells become plasmolysed and depolarized. Therefore, a smaller osmotic stress of sorbitol and saline was explored. Membrane PD exhibited fluctuations upon exposure to saline but not sorbitol medium. Low Ca 2 + concentration in the saline medium caused greater increase in background conductance and faster inactivation of the proton pump, depolarizing the membrane PD to excitation level. Spontaneous repetitive APs of extended duration caused further depolarization to PDs positive to outward rectifier threshold. Prolonged saline stress changed the I/V characteristics to upwardly concave shape. These I/V characteristics were modeled by channels that conduct H+ or OH-. Lastly, the salt-induced membrane PD fluctuations in Chara were inspected in time and frequency domains. In the range of 1 - 500 mHz 1 /f 2 noise power spectrum was observed. Other cations, such as Li+ and Cs+, also produced similar noise. The noise was pH and voltage dependent. A hypothesis to explain the noise was formulated, where groups of H+/OH- channels open transiently in early stages of salinity stress...|$|R
