5|$|Although Tingting passed about 400km (250mi) to the {{northeast}} of Guam, torrential rains from a monsoonal feeder band produced record-breaking rainfall. In the span of 24hours, 554.99mm (21.85in) <b>of</b> <b>rain</b> fell on Guam, shattering both the record for highest single day rainfall and the monthly rainfall for June at 80.26mm (3.16in) and 371.09mm (14.61in) respectively. Most of the northern areas of the island received more than 510mm (20in) <b>of</b> <b>rain</b> but the southern areas of Guam reported much lower totals. At Anderson Air Force Base, a total of 287.78mm (11.33in) <b>of</b> <b>rain</b> was recorded over a 30-hour span. Rota recorded much less rainfall than Guam, having 145.28mm (5.72in) during 24hours and a storm total of 221.99mm (8.75in).

30|$|It {{seems that}} the predicative {{function}} of these particles is still preserved in modern Mandarin. For example, {{the realization of the}} event <b>of</b> <b>raining</b> in 6 is signaled by the predicative utterance particle 了 le (cf. “There is an event <b>of</b> <b>raining</b> and this event <b>of</b> <b>raining</b> has been realized”), which inherits the aspectual meaning from the verb 了 liao ‘finish’. The temporal meaning of the event <b>of</b> <b>raining</b> in 7 is associated with 來著 laizhe (cf. “There was an event <b>of</b> <b>raining</b> and this event <b>of</b> <b>raining</b> had come to its existence”), which inherits the existential and directional meaning from the deictic verb 來 lai ‘come’ and the affirmative meaning from 著 zhuo ‘order’. The evaluative mood of 吧 ba in 8 can be interpreted as a solicitation of approval or agreement from the hearer that may settle certain debates or uncertainties (cf. “certain uncertainty of your going can be ceased”), which inherits the meaning of settling down from the verb 罷 ba ‘stop’. It is highly likely that these three particles in Mandarin, namely, 了 le, 來著 laizhe, and 吧 ba, all have a verbal origin, which {{can be traced back to}} verbs like 了 liao ‘finish’, 來 lai ‘come’, 著 zhuo ‘order’, and 罷 ba ‘stop’.|$|R

Plants established with the onset <b>of</b> <b>rains</b> also gave the highest yield of seed and the low seed yield due to later sowing resulted mainly from {{a reduction in the}} number of pods per plant rather that a substantial seed yield could be obtained when seeds are sown within a period of three weeks from the onset <b>of</b> <b>rains...</b>|$|R

40|$|Field {{studies were}} {{conducted}} at the ICRISAT Sahelian Center, Niamey, Niger, during 1986 and 1987 to test the methodology described earlier by Sivakumar (1988) that {{the potential of the}} rainy season in the Sahelian zone of West Africa can be determined from the date <b>of</b> onset <b>of</b> <b>rains.</b> We tested an early onset <b>of</b> <b>rains</b> treatment (imposed with supplemental irrigations) with the natural onset <b>of</b> <b>rains.</b> In 1986, natural onset was early while in 1987 it was considerably late. In both the seasons, dry matter production of millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) in the early onset <b>of</b> <b>rains</b> treatment reached 7 t ha− 1 while late onset <b>of</b> <b>rains</b> resulted in only 3 t ha− 1. Data on soil water profiles showed {{that at the time of}} the millet harvest in the early rains treatment, profile soil water is adequate to establish a second crop of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) for hay. This enables efficient exploitation of soil moisture. In addition, the combined water use of the two crops in the early rains treatment was much higher. Results of this study suggest that by tailoring management tactics to weather conditions, in years with early onset <b>of</b> <b>rains</b> it is possible to establish a second crop of cowpea for hay in the Sahelian zone where the farmers traditionally grow only millet. The implications of the suggested methodology for other climatic zones in West Africa and its limitations are discusse...|$|R
