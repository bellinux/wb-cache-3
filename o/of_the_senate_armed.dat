5|$|McCain {{entered the}} race for the Republican {{nomination}} for President in 2000, but he lost a heated primary season contest to George W. Bush of Texas. He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals, but was defeated by Democratic nominee Barack Obama in the general election, losing by a 365–173 electoral college margin. He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration, especially in regard to foreign policy matters. By 2013, however, he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment. In 2015, McCain became chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> Services Committee.|$|E

25|$|The December 27 {{assassination}} of former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto drew responses {{from all of}} the major candidates.

He also drew a contrast with his main Republican rivals, who did not have experience in foreign policy matters.

500|$|Upon {{entering}} the Senate in 1987, McCain kept a low profile. [...] He {{became a member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> Services Committee, with which he had formerly done his Navy liaison work; he was also given positions on the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee. [...] For {{his first two years}} in the Senate, he sat at the Candy desk.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{chaired the}} January 5, 2017 hearing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> Service Committee where Republican and Democrat {{senators}} and intelligence officers, including James R.

500|$|While {{control of}} the House of Representatives {{went over to the}} Republicans in the 112th Congress, the Senate stayed Democratic and McCain {{continued}} to be the ranking member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> Services Committee. As the Arab Spring took center stage, McCain urged that the embattled Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, step down and thought the U.S. should push for democratic reforms in the region despite the associated risks of religious extremists gaining power. McCain was an especially vocal supporter of the 2011 military intervention in Libya. In April of that year he visited the Anti-Gaddafi forces and National Transitional Council in Benghazi, the highest-ranking American to do so, and said that the rebel forces were [...] "my heroes". In June, he joined with Senator Kerry in offering a resolution that would have authorized the military intervention, and said: [...] "The administration's disregard for the elected representatives of the American people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive." [...] In August, McCain voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011 that resolved the U.S. debt ceiling crisis. In November, McCain and Senator Carl Levin were leaders in efforts to codify in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 that terrorism suspects, no matter where captured, could be detained by the U.S. military and its tribunal system; following objections by civil libertarians, some Democrats, and the White House, McCain and Levin agreed to language making it clear that the bill would not pertain to U.S. citizens.|$|E

Locklear cited USAID government statistics on recent Indo-Asian natural disasters and the long range planning challenges of our security partners and allies in the region.|$|R
50|$|Congressional {{oversight}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Academy is exercised {{through a}} Board of Visitors (BOV), established under Title 10, United States Code, Section 9355. The board inquires into the morale, discipline, curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs, academic methods {{and other matters}} relating to the Academy. The board meets {{at least four times}} per year and prepares semi-annual reports containing its views and recommendations submitted concurrently to <b>the</b> Secretary <b>of</b> Defense, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> Services Committee, and the House Armed Services Committee. <b>The</b> 15 members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BOV are variously appointed by <b>the</b> President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States, the Vice President, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> and House <b>Armed</b> Services Committees and <b>the</b> Speaker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Representatives. Since 2006, the board has been required to include at least two Academy graduates. In July 2009, Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed Colorado Congressman Jared Polis to the BOV, the first openly gay person to serve on a service academy’s advisory board.|$|R
500|$|As {{his tenure}} with VA-174 was ending, McCain was {{assigned}} to a low-profile desk job within the Naval Air Systems Command. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral James L. Holloway III thought this assignment a waste of McCain's social talents, and instead in July 1977 McCain {{was appointed to the}} Senate Liaison Office within the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs (an assignment Jack McCain had once held). The office's role mostly consisted of providing constituent service and acting as a facilitator among legislators, the Department of Defense, and lobbyists. McCain later said the liaison job represented [...] " [...] real entry into the world of politics and the beginning of my second career as a public servant". McCain's lively personality and knowledge of military matters made his post in the Russell Senate Office Building a popular gathering spot for senators and staff. He also frequently escorted congressional delegations on overseas trips, where he arranged entertaining side escapades. McCain was influenced by senators of both parties, and formed an especially strong bond with John Tower of Texas, the ranking member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> Services Committee. During 1978 and 1979, McCain played a key behind-the-scenes role in gaining congressional funding for a new supercarrier against the wishes of the Carter administration and Navy Secretary W. Graham Claytor Jr. In August 1979, McCain was promoted to naval captain, and became Director of the Senate Liaison Office. [...] During McCain's time there, the Senate Liaison Office enjoyed one of its few periods of high influence.|$|E

From 1985 to 1988, {{he served in}} the State Department as U.S. Chief Negotiator on Strategic Offensive Arms (START I) in Geneva. He has also served as Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, senior {{director}} on the National Security Council, professional staff <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> Services Committee, and in Vietnam with the United States Army. Lehman testified regularly before the U.S. Congress and was on <b>the</b> advisory board <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Institute of Peace.

5000|$|In 1973, Norvill Jones, {{a staffer}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Committee <b>of</b> <b>Senate</b> Foreign Relations, tried to {{interest}} members {{in establishing a}} procedure by which Congress could review large arms sales. Finding no takers, Jones mentioned the idea to Dr. Paula Stern, then a foreign policy aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson <b>of</b> Wisconsin, later <b>the</b> Chairwoman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. International Trade Commission (1984-1986). Nelson approved the idea and introduced an amendment for a one-house veto over significant arms sales. Stern and Nelson settled on a reporting [...] "tripwire" [...] <b>of</b> $25 million, <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> a squadron of F-5E's. Nelson has credited Stern with conceiving the amendment and supplying the persistence needed to steer <b>the</b> attention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> to <b>arms</b> sales. Nelson's proposed floor measure passed 44 to 43 in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> but a like House measure introduced by Representative Jonathan Bingham of New York was defeated.|$|R
5000|$|A {{prominent}} example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impact arms-producing {{industries have}} over American policy {{is evident in}} <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> Lockheed Martin donating $75,000 to House Armed Services Committee chair Representative Mac Thornberry (R-TX). Rep. Thornberry later passed a bill through <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Representatives that would benefit Lockheed Martin. This decision was made {{as a direct result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> Lockheed Martin. Politico has stated Rep. Thornberry is the [...] "highest overall recipient of contractor contributions among all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 89 members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House and <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> Services Committees." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2013, Kaine {{supported}} {{oil and gas}} exploration off {{the coast}} of Virginia, saying, [...] "I have long believed that the moratorium on offshore drilling, based on a cost-benefit calculation performed decades ago, should be re-examined." [...] In April 2015, Kaine reiterated his opposition to the moratorium on offshore drilling. In March 2016, Kaine signaled that his position was softening, saying he was [...] "particularly struck by the material objections of the Department of Defense to the incompatibility of drilling with naval operations off Virginia’s coast... I have participated in this debate for over a decade as a governor and member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> Services Committee. The DOD has been relatively quiet during this public debate and has never shared their objections with me before." [...] By August 2016, Kaine stated his support for a ban on offshore drilling, bringing his position in line with that of Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration.|$|E

2500|$|Goldwater {{retired in}} 1987, serving as chair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Intelligence and <b>Armed</b> Services Committees {{in his final}} term.
