25|$|Boyd and Williams moved {{slightly}} more north {{as they began}} to work in the Memphis based promotion Continental Wrestling Association owned and operated by Jerry Jarrett and Jerry Lawler. In the CWA, the Sheepherders would start a feud that stood as their most memorable, bloody, and brutal as the team kicked off a long running feud with The Fabulous Ones (Stan Lane and Steve Keirn). The “pretty boy”, well polished Fabulous Ones and the ugly, brawling savage Sheepherders were the perfect opponents and repeatedly drew big gates all over the country. The matches started <b>out</b> <b>pretty</b> evenly, but soon turned brutal and often without a definite winner. In late 1982, the Sheepherders won the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship from Lane and Keirn, which only turned the intensity of the matches up a notch. Between late December and mid-February, the two teams traded the belts back and forth 4 times with the Fabulous Ones ending up with possession of them in the end. On 28 March, the Sheepherders wrestled their last match in the Mid-South Coliseum before leaving the CWA.|$|E
25|$|After {{dealing with}} Jimmy Hart's stable the Fabulous Ones {{suddenly}} {{got a whole}} different team challenging them for the gold. Luke Williams and Jonathan Boyd (The Sheepherders) had entered the CWA {{in the fall of}} 1982 and soon came head to head with the Fabulous Ones. The Fabulous Ones / Sheepherder feud stands {{as one of the most}} memorable and bloody feuds. A feud that would rage on in several promotions between 1982 and 1987. The “pretty boy”, well polished Fabulous Ones and the ugly, brawling savage Sheepherders made for the perfect opponents and repeatedly drew big gates all over the country. The matches started <b>out</b> <b>pretty</b> evenly with the Fabulous Ones and the Sheepherders splitting the decisions but soon turned brutal and often without a definite winner.

25|$|The {{first test}} {{was an instant}} classic. Australia made 428 in its first innings. Opening batsman Shane Watson scored a century and Wicket keeper Tim Paine made a 92 to lead the charge. In reply India's top order almost contributed equally with Sachin Tendulkar scoring 98 and Suresh Raina scoring 86. India made 405 in their first innings. Indian bowlers led a surge in the second Innings to rout Australia to 192. India were set a target of 216. Wickets started to fall in the evening of 4th day with Ben Hilfenhaus taking the key wickets of Gambhir, Sehwag and Raina. The score stood at 55/4 {{at the end of}} 4th day's Play with Tendulkar playing with night {{watchman}} Zaheer Khan. Australia started the 5th day well to remove Zaheer Khan first. VVS Laxman who played late down the order because of his back injury joined Tendulkar for the 6th wicket. They improved the scoring rate considerably. However Tendulkar was out for 38 trying to play an upper late cut off Bollinger. MS Dhoni then followed Tendulkar as he was run out following a confusion with Raina who was a by runner for VVS Laxman. The score stood at 122/7. Harbhajan too was <b>out</b> <b>pretty</b> quickly facing just 2 deliveries. It looked all but over for India. India were 124/8 with an injury-ridden VVS Laxman and Ishant sharma at the crease and only Pragyan Ojha to follow. India still needed 92 runs to win with just 2 wickets remaining at lunch. It looked like a lost cause to India.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2003–04 season, Iginla was named the 18th captain in Flames {{franchise}} history, and 14th since the team moved to Calgary from Atlanta in 1980. His predecessor as captain, Craig Conroy, cited Iginla's experience and leadership for his decision to relinquish the captaincy. [...] "He was a leader on that team and old enough to where he'd been there a long time. It was time for him. He took us to the Stanley Cup Final that year so it worked <b>out</b> <b>pretty</b> well."

500|$|Critics {{were divided}} about Rick Grimes' return to Atlanta, {{as well as}} his stand off with Guillermo and his gang. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic {{compared}} Grimes to Mad Men Don Draper, and questioned his character development: [...] "So far, every decision Rick has made has been both within his code and consequence-free," [...] he said. Pierce opined: [...] "Dramatically, this whole sequence plays <b>out</b> <b>pretty</b> hokily. Guillermo's dialogue is ridiculous, and the entire storyline plays like something out of an episodic social-lesson-of-the-week show.

The former, which is a song that Kaplan learned for a solo guitar show, was originally used to make sure the recording equipment was set up right.

Friedman described the stories as, [...] "candy apples without the apples - all sugary, and gooey and sweet, with not much of anything else to support it". After initially having this stance for the entire series, including an early opinion on the anime version, Friedman later changed her opinion slightly, writing that [...] " [...] turned <b>out</b> <b>pretty</b> good". She went on to say, [...] "There's no denying that Strawberry Panic! wasn't brilliant, but considering that {{it was meant to be}} trashy, it pulled out a few moments of dignity and elegance out of the trash heap." [...] Jason Thompson regarded the Strawberry Panic! manga as [...] "a nearly plotless cascade [...] everything seems rushed, and it is difficult to keep track of the characters and plot." ...|$|E

She remarked of her experience of joining the team on Voyager, [...] "It was a little awkward since the cast had been together for three years already. And one of the original characters was being written <b>out</b> <b>pretty</b> much at the same time I was being added. But the cast was terrific, and very welcoming." [...] Although she wore extensive make-up for her first appearances, including an eye-piece that fell off when she smiled, her typical make-up regime took around 45 minutes, with the attachment of the Borg appliance above her eye taking an additional 15 minutes. Her hairstyling usually took as long as that combined.|$|E

2500|$|Associate Creative Consultant Donna Lettow {{says about}} Darius' {{character}} development, [...] "It was always planned that Darius would die in [...] "The Hunters". The original plan for Darius {{was that he}} would reappear in flashbacks, much like Fitzcairn does now." [...] Stocker's illness in early 1993 prevented this. Panzer remembers that Stocker [...] "had announced that he had a brain tumor." [...] The season 1 promotional booklet recounts, [...] "Just days before going into production [...] actor Werner Stocker was stricken ill and was unable to work. By now the character of Darius had {{become an integral part of}} the story and the writers had to scramble to adjust the story line." [...] Abramowitz recalls, [...] "I got a call at three o'clock in the morning, saying Werner would not be available, we were shooting in a day and a half, and there was fear if we were going to have to shut down. I went into work, wrote twenty-five straight hours, without a break, and got out a script and the show went on and it turned <b>out</b> <b>pretty</b> well." [...] This script bears the date March 15, 1993. The production crew, too, had to adapt to the situation. The promotional booklet reports, [...] "Footage from previous episodes was successfully used to fill in for the absent actor." [...] Stocker died on May 27, 1993.
