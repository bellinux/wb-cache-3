5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E
5|$|R. v. Kent Police Authority, {{ex parte}} Godden (1972) is an {{instance}} of a United Kingdom case in which an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> was issued to avert action {{that would not have}} complied with administrative law rules. In July 1970, Godden, a police chief inspector of Kent Police Authority, was examined by the police authority's chief medical officer, who took the view that he was suffering from a mental disorder and thus unfit for duty. Godden was therefore placed on sick leave, although his own specialist found {{that he did not have}} any psychiatric illness. Subsequently, in January 1971, the police authority informed him that it would be appointing the chief medical officer to assess if he was permanently disabled, for the purpose of determining if he should be compulsorily retired. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales found that since the medical officer had previously formed the opinion that Godden was mentally disordered, he could not be impartial when assessing if Godden was permanently disabled. Thus, an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> should be issued to prohibit him from carrying out this assessment.|$|E

25|$|Justice Chan {{began by}} affirming that the High Court has {{jurisdiction}} {{to issue an}} <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> against the Government. Although section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act states that courts cannot grant an injunction in civil proceedings against the Government, he rejected the State Counsel's argument that based on this provision the Court did not have power to do so. He held that the reference in section 27 to civil proceedings it did not relate to judicial review proceedings and, hence, that provision {{did not affect the}} court's ability to grant an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> during a judicial review of government proceedings.|$|E
25|$|Justice Chan {{held that}} the High Court had {{jurisdiction}} to issue an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> against the DG's decision, as section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act did not strip the court of such jurisdiction. Furthermore, the DG had acted on an incorrect basis of fact in arriving at his decision that the goods had not been exported. This fact could have been verified objectively with evidence put forward by the applicant, but the DG had not carried out an adequate investigation. This {{had the effect of}} making the investigation unfair towards the applicant's company. Hence, an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> was entered against the DG.|$|E
25|$|On 30 December 1988, the {{applicant}} Fong Thin Choo, {{a director of}} the company, applied to the High Court of Singapore for leave to obtain a writ of prohibition (now known as a prohibiting order) to prohibit the DG from recovering this sum by deducting it from certain bankers' guarantees that had been lodged with Customs as security.

500|$|Judicial {{review of}} {{preventive}} detention {{pursuant to the}} ISA was curtailed by the insertion of sections 8A to 8D.

The section was presumably intended to cover all possible court applications that might be brought against executive directions and orders made under the ISA.|$|R
25|$|Re Fong Thin Choo is an {{administrative}} law case decided in 1991 by the High Court of Singapore concerning {{the legality of}} a demand by the Director-General of Customs and Excise ("DG") that the applicant's company pay S$130,241.30 in customs duty as it had not exported certain goods. The case was presided over by Justice Chan Sek Keong. The Court decided that the DG had failed {{to take into account}} relevant evidence adduced by the applicant's company which could have been capable of rebutting the prima facie evidence of non-export, and had thus made an insufficient inquiry before arriving at his decision. Since the DG's demand had been based on an incorrect basis of fact and thus had been made contrary to law, the Court granted the applicant an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> that barred the DG from deducting the sum from certain bankers' guarantees that the applicant's company had lodged with Customs as security.|$|E
25|$|In total, nine {{affidavits}} {{were submitted}} by the applicant to substantiate his claims that the goods had indeed been exported. The state counsel submitted that the evidence which had been provided after December 1988 (when the application for an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> was taken out) could not be taken into consideration. While Justice Chan doubted the validity of such a submission, he nevertheless proceeded to assess the affidavits provided before this date. The applicable evidence {{was made up of}} two statements: a statement made by the applicant that his company had arranged for shipment of the goods directly with the shipowner (which explained why the vessel's agents testified that they were not aware that any goods had been loaded on to the vessel), and a statement by TKM accompanied with copies of invoices that showed he had received the goods and paid for them. Such evidence could have proved the export of the goods, and was in direct conflict with the affidavits {{submitted by the}} DG. There was thus a serious dispute as to whether the goods had in fact been exported.|$|E

The Director-General of Customs and Excise subsequently concluded that the goods had never been exported, and requested that the company pay import duty of $130,241.30 on them. The company applied for an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> to bar the Director-General from proceeding to recover a sum of $130,241.30 by deducting it from several bankers' guarantees that had been lodged with Customs as security.

2500|$|Justice Chan held {{further that}} the legal {{principles}} applicable to certiorari (now known as quashing orders) are equally applicable to an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition.</b> These principles were stated in R. v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, ex parte Lain (1967), where it was held that [...] "the ambit of certiorari {{can be said to}} cover every case in which a body of persons of a public as opposed to a purely private or domestic character has to determine matters affecting subjects provided always that it has a duty to act judicially". As the DG was a public officer appointed to discharge public duties, his decision was an exercise of public duty. Hence the DG could be subjected to an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> if he acted in excess of his authority.|$|E
2500|$|Re Fong Thin Choo (1991) was a Singapore case {{in which}} the {{applicant}} successfully proved that a public authority had failed to take into account relevant considerations. The Customs and Excise Department had not supervised the loading on to ships of cigarettes that the applicant's company intended to export from Singapore, and later discovered that some of these goods were not on the ships' manifests even though the company had declared that they were to be exported. Following an investigation, the Director-General of Customs and Excise ("DG") concluded that the goods had never been exported. Since the company was thus liable to pay import duty on the goods, the DG proceeded to recover the amount of duty from bankers' guarantees that had been lodged by the company with the Customs and Excise Department. The company sought leave to apply for an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> to prevent the Department from taking such action. Justice Chan Sek Keong quoted the following passage with approval: ...|$|E
