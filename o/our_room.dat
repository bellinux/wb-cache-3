500|$|Ralph M. Cole, {{a member}} of the golf team of 1926-1928, later wrote of a humorous {{incident}} involving the septuagenarian Coach Trueblood. Cole recalled: [...] "As golf coach he could add very little about the mechanics of the game. But he added one piece of advice which was very helpful when followed, and which he drilled into us at every practice session. It was: 'Up and out in two, boys.' As any golfer would know, it meant, when hitting a short approach shot, get it close enough to the pin to make the next putt. [...] Now for the humorous part of that admonition. We had played Purdue in Lafayette on a Thursday and were to play Illinois on Friday. The Professor was to call us at 4:30a.m. to catch a 5:30 train for Urbana. Well, he got confused on <b>our</b> <b>room</b> number and awakened a man who called the front desk and told the night clerk that there must be some nut calling at 4:30a.m. and shouting, 'Up and out in two boys!' [...] We did make the train, anyway." ...|$|E

60|$|As to <b>our</b> bed <b>rooms,</b> {{you must}} know that all the apartments in this house are named after {{different}} plays of Shakspeare, the name being printed conspicuously over each door; so that the choosing of <b>our</b> <b>rooms</b> made us a little sport.|$|R
2500|$|Reviews {{following}} {{months after}} publication contained limited positive {{appraisal of the}} poem. William Roberts's review, for the August 1816 British Review, was more positive than previous analysis but with no detail about the work: [...] "passing over the two other poems which are bound together with 'Christabel', called 'The Fragment of Kubla Khan', and 'The Pains of Sleep'; in which, however, there are some playful thoughts and fanciful imagery, which we would gladly have extracted if <b>our</b> <b>room</b> would have allowed it." [...] The next review came in the January 1817 Monthly Review, with the anonymous reviewer questioning: [...] "Allowing every possible accuracy to the statement of Mr. Coleridge, we would yet ask him whether this extraordinary fragment was not rather the effect of rapid and instant composition after he was awake, than of memory immediately recording that which he dreamt when asleep? By what process of consciousness could he distinguish between such composition and such reminiscence? Impressed as his mind was with his interesting dream, and habituated as he is ... to the momentary production of verse, will he venture to assert {{that he did not}} compose, and that he did remember, the lines before us?" [...] The review then concluded, [...] "His 'psychological curiosity', as he terms it, depends in no slight degree on the establishment of the previous fact which we have mentioned: but the poem itself is below criticism. We would dismiss it with some portentous words of Sir Kenelm Digby, in his observations on Browne's religio Medici: 'I have much ado to believe what he speaketh confidently; that he is more beholding to Morpheus for learned and rational as well as pleasing dreams, than to Mercury for smart and facetious conceptions'." ...|$|E
