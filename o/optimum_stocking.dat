40|$|Animal {{production}} in grazing experiments depends both on treatment and on stocking rate. Production at <b>optimum</b> <b>stocking</b> rate {{is the only}} valid measure of treatment effect and treatment comparisons {{should be based on}} this criterion. Since <b>optimum</b> <b>stocking</b> rates are unknown these comparisons cannot be made directly, instead they must be in-ferred from the results obtained with the stocking rates actually used. This requires that some form of production stocking rate relationship be postulated. This paper sug-gests a form for this relationship and considers its implications on experimental design and particularly on the number of stocking rates per treatment. The evaluation of treatment effects on animal production from grazed pasture is complicated by the interaction of treatments with stocking rate. It is now widely recognized that comparing treat-ments at a single common stocking rate does not give a true measure of treatment differences. A fair assessment of treatments requires that they be com...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Simple grazing {{models with}} two herbivores {{are used to}} assess the effects of pasture pests on {{stability}} and productivity of continously-growing pastures. Algebraic and graphical methods are also presented for estimating losses from pasture pests at different stocking rates directly, from data on productivity/stocking rate relationships. Pests are considered as competing grazing herbivores and denuders of pasture area. Denuding pests have no effect on stability but grazing pests increase the likelihood of discontinuous stability. The forms of the damage function and its dependence on stocking rate are described for both types of pest. Estimating losses from pasture pests by an equivalent reduction in stocking rate can give useful 'best bet' results even when the true effect is to reduce per capita productivity at fixed stocking rates. However, the first will overestimate or underestimate the second in particular situations, depending on the level of the fixed stocking rate relative to the economic optimum. Actual economic losses for rabbits and porina caterpillars, representing grazing and denuding pests, are estimated as $ 2. 1 /rabbit and $ 0. 08 /porina m- 2 /stock unit carried, based on a reduction in stocking rate. At a fixed <b>optimum</b> <b>stocking</b> rate losses are 300 / 0 greater, and at a fixed 75 % <b>optimum</b> <b>stocking</b> rate losses are 60 % less...|$|E

The main objective is to capture the evidence that some fishing gears alter the habitat of the resource, and may alter the natural growth rate of the resource. The main result we obtain is that, when the natural growth of the resource is altered by the fishing technology, the optimal stock is not independent of how harvest quotas are distributed among the agents.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the problem of}} the optimal management of a joint-ownership fishing exploitation, where agents use different fishing gears. We consider a model in which the fishing activity may affect resource growth, not only through the harvest function but also through the natural growth rate of the resource. This allows us to capture the fact that some fishing gears alter the natural growth rate of the resource. We find that when the natural growth of the resource is altered by the fishing technology, the optimal stock is not independent of how harvest quotas are distribute among the agents. As a result, a fishing policy that firstly determines the <b>optimum</b> <b>stock</b> and, secondly, decides how to distribute the harvest among the different agents, will not be efficient. We also analyze the joint determination of optimal stock and harvest quotas and show that positive harvest quotas will only be optimal when countries are characterized by certain asymmetries.

The objective {{of the present study}} was to analyze the factors of knowledge of prospective blood donors that may influence their perception and awareness about blood donation. Materials and Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Gangtok in the state of Sikkim, India, on 300 subjects of the adult population selected by two-stage cluster sampling. The main outcome variables were the socioeconomic and demographic variables of knowledge of blood donation. By interview technique, using the pre-tested structured close-ended questionnaire, the principal investigator collected the data. Results: In our study population, 46 &#x 0025; of the study population was found to have a high knowledge score. The knowledge about blood donation was found to be statistically significant with the occupational status and the education levels, both in the bivariate and in the multivariate analyses.

In the offered herbage mass for SRL significant lower ash-, CP-, APDE- and APDN values as well as higher NDF values were detected. Sugar- and NEL values were unaffected. No significant differences were found for milk production per cow, but milk production per ha was significantly higher for SRH. Apart from two exceptions (lactose 2005 and urea 2006), no significant differences were identified for milk composition.

The purpose herein is to resume the debate on Optimum Reserves in Argentina, from the analysis of our recent past and on the basis of three stylized facts that have hindered our growth on a long term stable path: Debt crisis, Bank or financial crisis and currency exchange crisis. Taking into account the Default declaration in 2001 and the enormous adjustment that our economy had to face, reflecting on the “Productive model” implemented in 2003, I propose to find the optimum level of reserves given a probability of default for the period 1997 - 2007. Likewise, in order to overcome the static feature of the previous issue, a possible dynamic extension is presented through the calculus of variations theory, appealing to a hypothetical situation in order to analyze the analytical results found. The most important result that is reached is that during the 90 s the level of reserves studied is much lower than the optimum, while in the following decade this trend is reverted obtaining since 2007 an accumulation surplus on these assets. Finally, when incorporating the adjustment costs to the issue of optimization it was possible to obtain a “genuine” reserve feature, that is, a flow demand that represents the desired variations in the reserve stock.

Development indices decreased in a linear fashion throughout emergence but the slope and intercept of the line did not differ among egg stocking densities.
