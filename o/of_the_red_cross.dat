5|$|On 28 September 1944, El Oriente was {{chartered}} by the International Committee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross,</b> reflagged as a Swiss ship, and renamed SS Henry Dunant (sometimes erroneously spelled as Henri Dunant), after Red Cross movement founder Henry Dunant.

50|$|<b>The</b> town <b>of</b> Cochem and its castle {{were held}} by <b>the</b> Archbishops <b>of</b> Trier {{beginning}} in 1298. They also granted Cochem town rights in 1332.

This composition appeared in the earliest known town seal, from the early 15th century, which likely dates from a bit earlier, the late 14th century.|$|R

A little <b>red</b> <b>cross</b> would be pretty to hang up over her bed; it would also help to keep off harm, and would perhaps make Ninna stronger.
