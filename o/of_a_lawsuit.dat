The elevator to the Red Line was out of service for 15 months beginning in March 2011 for car replacement and the installation of a second, redundant, elevator. An accessible shuttle bus ran between Porter and Davis.|$|E
5|$|Former Financial Times {{journalist}} Duff McDonald, said McKinsey's confidentiality policy often {{prevents the}} public from becoming informed about the firm's work, except after it is exposed through lawsuits or investigations. 13,000 McKinsey documents were released as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawsuit</b> against Allstate, which showed that McKinsey recommended the company reduce payouts to insurance claimants by offering low settlements, delaying processing to wear out claimants through attrition, and fighting customers that protest in court. Allstate's profits doubled over ten years after adopting McKinsey's strategy, but it also led to lawsuits alleging they were cheating claimants out of legitimate insurance claims.|$|E
5|$|In 1999 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer {{obtained}} {{the rights to}} the 1967 film Casino Royale from Sony Pictures Entertainment for $10million in the out-of-court settlement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawsuit.</b> The case was brought by MGM after Sony had announced a deal with Kevin McClory to produce a third version of the Thunderball novel, for which McClory held the film rights. McClory had previously acted as producer with Eon on Thunderball and had licensed his rights for the production of Never Say Never Again in 1983. In 2004, following severe financial troubles, MGM was itself acquired by a consortium backed by Sony for $5 billion.|$|E

5|$|Leigh {{appeared}} with Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan in A Yank at Oxford (1938), {{which was the}} first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends. After dealing with the threat <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawsuit</b> brought over a frivolous incident, Korda, however, instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve. Her next role was in Sidewalks of London, also known as St. Martin's Lane (1938), with Charles Laughton.|$|E
5|$|Slipknot is {{the debut}} studio album by the American heavy metal band Slipknot. It was {{released}} on June 29, 1999 by Roadrunner Records, following a demo containing {{a few of the}} songs which had been released in 1998, and was reissued in December 1999 with a slightly altered track listing and mastering as the result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawsuit.</b> It was the first release by the band to be produced by Ross Robinson, who sought to refine Slipknot's sound rather than alter the group's musical direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} a young lawyer being fed up with a giant law firm and bolting away to a less lucrative but more {{satisfying}} career is shared with The Associate. The theme <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawsuit</b> against a giant corporation appeared in The Runaway Jury, but in the present book, the corporation is vindicated and proven to have been unjustly maligned (at least on the specific drug which {{is the subject of}} the lawsuit) and the mass tort lawyers are seen as greedy and unscrupulous, ultimately bolting and leaving the protagonist's tiny Chicago firm in the lurch.|$|E

5|$|Both Murphy and Universal gave serious {{considerations}} to {{a follow-up}} {{version of his}} post-war life. Murphy rejected the Richard J. Collins script The Way Back which created the fictional scenario that filming To Hell and Back had been so therapeutic for Murphy that it cured him of his combat fatigue. Spec McClure scripted a second unused version of The Way Back that incorporated Murphy's real-life friends into the storyline and ended with the star living happily ever after with Pamela and their two sons. A third version by an unknown writer focused on the Murphy-McClure friendship and {{was rejected by the}} threat <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawsuit</b> from McClure. Desi Arnaz offered to bankroll a 1965 project titled Helmets in the Dust. At Murphy's request McClure wrote a film treatment, but the project never came to fruition.|$|E

He is on its board of directors and has adopted a number of horses from Habitat for Horses. In 2008, Nelson signed on to warn consumers about the cruel and illegal living conditions for calves raised to produce milk for dairy products. He wrote letters to Land O'Lakes and Challenge Dairy, two of the major corporations that use milk from calves raised at California's Mendes Calf Ranch, which employs an intensive confinement practice that was the subject <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawsuit</b> and campaign brought by the Animal Legal Defense Fund.|$|E
5|$|The Inquirers {{circulation}} {{has been}} dropping since the 1980s, {{and except for}} briefly seeing a rise in weekday circulation in 2007, The Philadelphia Inquirers weekday and Sunday circulation has continued to steadily drop since Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the paper. Loss of circulation combined with an unexpected drop in advertising revenue have forced more than 400 job cuts at The Inquirer and Daily News since they were bought by Philadelphia Media Holdings. As Philadelphia Media Holdings financial situation worsened in 2008 employees began complaining about how management has been monitoring things such as bathroom breaks and the coffee they drink, and that Tierney has been patrolling the parking garage seeing what time employees arrive for work. Despite efforts to manage the financial strain, on February 21, 2009, Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, the subsidiary of Philadelphia Media Holdings that owns the paper, filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company hoped to restructure the US$390 million in debt it borrowed to buy the newspapers, but the end result was that the papers were auctioned off to the company's lenders. The beginning of 2009 also saw the filing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawsuit</b> that accused The Philadelphia Inquirer of writing critical stories about Chester Community Charter School's use of public funds after business negotiations between school operator Vahan H. Gureghian and Tierney failed.|$|E

5|$|On local issues, Howard was an {{advocate}} of opening Richmond to gambling facilities, {{which led to the}} River Rock Casino Resort. He was supportive of heritage preservation measures but opposed Richmond's tree preservation bylaw. He was the only one on council who preferred the elevated option for the Canada Line (then known as the Richmond-Airport-Vancouver Line), whereas the other councillors preferred the ground level option or no SkyTrain extension at all. He was {{an advocate}} for building a convention centre and the most ardent supporter of removing a 55-acre piece of land from the Agricultural Land Reserve as a possible location for it, though the removal was refused. When the possibility of the city constructing a speed-skating oval associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics came, Howard was a vocal supporter. He travelled to Lillehammer, Norway, in 2004 as part of a committee to investigate similar facilities built for the 1994 Winter Olympics. He also traveled to Pierrefonds, Quebec and Asia as part of the sister city program. He was not supportive of proposals to build a new soccer facility or financially contributing to tall ships tourism attractions. Because previous councils had made funding commitments {{at the expense of the}} city's reserve funds rather than the tax base, Howard's time on council was marked with consistent property tax increases around 3 to 4% each year. Howard unsuccessfully lobbied other councillors to hire more police officers. He became the subject <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawsuit,</b> along with other Richmond First councillors, alleging a conflict-of-interest occurred after they approved a rezoning allowing a controversial pub.|$|E
