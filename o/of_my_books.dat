500|$|When {{dealing with}} the {{dialogue}} in his novels, Wodehouse would consider the book's characters {{as if they were}} actors in a play, ensuring that the main roles were kept suitably employed throughout the storyline, which must be strong: [...] "If they aren't in interesting situations, characters can't be major characters, not even if you have the rest of the troop talk their heads off about them." [...] Many of Wodehouse's parts were stereotypes, and he acknowledged that [...] "a real character in one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>books</b> sticks out like a sore thumb." [...] The publisher Michael Joseph identifies that even within the stereotypes Wodehouse understood human nature, and therefore [...] "shares with [...] Dickens and Charles Chaplin the ability to present the comic resistance of the individual against those superior forces to which we are all subject".|$|E

Today's fads, trends, shortsightedness, ignorance can {{disguise}} a deeper understanding of what I try to get through to the minds. [...] This is natural. For generations to come it is common sense what is hard to fathom today for many. In my life I have reached a significant number of people compared to the masses I will teach after I am gone for decades to come." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alice Bailey: [...] "But {{those of}} us who really studied it and arrived at some {{understanding}} of its inner significance have a basic appreciation of the truth that no other book seems to supply. HPB said that the next interpretation of the Ageless Wisdom would be a psychological approach, and , which I published in 1925, is the psychological key to The Secret Doctrine. None <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>books</b> would have been possible had I not at one time made a very close study of The Secret Doctrine." ...|$|E
2500|$|This novel caused Adams {{to become}} acquainted with the {{well-known}} scientist Richard Dawkins. As Dawkins explains, [...] "As soon as I finished it, I turned back to page one and read it straight through again – the only time I have ever done that, and I wrote to tell him so. He replied {{that he was a}} fan <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>books,</b> and he invited me to his house in London." [...] Adams would later introduce Dawkins to the woman who was to become his third wife, the actress Lalla Ward, best known for playing the character Romana in Doctor Who. One of her early serials on the programme was City of Death, which Adams wrote, and which shares certain plot elements with the novel.|$|E

Born near {{the close of}} the buffalo days he was, and ever since with his baby hands he began to model statuettes of horses and buffalo and deer with clay from the river-banks, his one object in life has been {{to make a name for}} himself in the world of art. And now, at last, he has furnished the drawings for one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>books,</b> this book. His own grandfather, Black Eagle, was a mighty warrior against the Snakes.

2500|$|In January 2015, the Kareela Golf and Social Club in Sydney, Australia {{cancelled}} a {{talk that}} Tenpenny {{had been scheduled}} to give there. A spokesperson for the club said that the subject matter Tenpenny was going to discuss was [...] "too controversial for us to be involved in." [...] Several other Australian venues followed suit soon afterward, which led Meryl Dorey of anti-vaccination lobby group the Australian Vaccination-Skeptics Network to compare opponents of Tenpenny's visits to Australia to the perpetrators of the Charlie Hebdo shooting. By January 19, all eight venues at which Tenpenny was originally scheduled to speak had cancelled her seminars. Virologist David Hawkes responds to the cancellation of the lecture series by saying it [...] "was a win for people who were concerned about public health...." [...] "It's been driven by parents generally at a community level who were concerned about the emergence of diseases like whooping cough {{in the last few years}} due to less than ideal vaccination rates." [...] In an email to her supporters in April 2015, Messenger asks, “If everyone just purchased one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>books,</b> imagine how quickly I can be out of debt for the cancelled Dr Sherri Tenpenny tour.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, the 50th {{anniversary of}} Buechner's ordination, Rich Barlowe wrote of Buechner in the Boston Globe, [...] "Who knows? The words are Frederick Buechner's mantra. Over {{the course of}} an hourlong chat with the writer and Presbyterian {{minister}} in his kitchen, they recur any number of times in response to questions about his faith and theology. Dogmatic religious believers would dismiss the two words as the warning shot of doubt. But for Buechner, it is precisely our doubts and struggles that mark us as human. And that insight girds his theological twist on Socrates: The unexamined human life is a lost chance to behold the divine." [...] In 2002, Richard Kauffman interviewed Buechner for The Christian Century upon the publication of Speak What We Feel (Not What We Ought to Say). Buechner answered the question [...] "Do you envision a particular audience when you write?" [...] by saying [...] "I always hope to reach people who don't want to touch religion with a ten-foot pole. The cultured despisers of religion, Sehleiermacher called them. Maybe some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>books</b> reach them. But most of my readers, as far as I can tell, aren't that type. Many of them are ministers. They say, 'You've given us something back we lost and opened up doors we didn't think could be opened for people.'" ...|$|E
