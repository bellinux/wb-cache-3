5|$|Of Antisthenes' Aspasia <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> {{quotations}} are extant. This dialogue contains much slander, {{but also}} anecdotes pertaining to Pericles' biography. Antisthenes {{appears to have}} attacked not only Aspasia, but the entire family of Pericles, including his sons. The philosopher believes that the great statesman chose the life of pleasure over virtue. Thus, Aspasia is presented as the personification {{of the life of}} sexual indulgence.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of its deployment, the first contingent focused most of its efforts on providing accommodations for electoral centres and police stations. These were typically manned by <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> police (or civilian) electoral staff and were almost always in small, remote villages. Buildings were leased, {{a large number of}} caravans purchased and deployed and prefabricated buildings constructed in about 50 locations. Much of this was done by the Resources Troop (under Lieutenant Stuart Graham), centrally controlled by squadron construction officer Captain Shane Miller.|$|E
5|$|<b>Only</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> frets {{are needed}} for the guitarchords—major, minor, and {{dominant}} sevenths—which are emphasized in introductions to guitar-playing and to the fundamentals of music. Each major and minor chord can be played on two successive frets on three successive strings, and therefore each needs only two fingers. Other chords—seconds, fourths, sevenths, and ninths—are played on only three successive frets. For fundamental-chord fingerings, major-thirds tuning's simplicity and consistency are not shared by standard tuning, whose seventh-chord fingering is discussed {{at the end of}} this section.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} puffins (Fratercula arctica), {{which may have}} given the island its name, {{declined}} in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with the 2005 breeding population estimated to be <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> pairs, {{as a consequence of}} depredations by brown and black rats (Rattus rattus) (which have now been eliminated) and possibly also as a result of commercial fishing for sand eels, the puffins' principal prey. Since 2005, the breeding numbers have been slowly increasing. Adults were seen taking fish into four burrows in 2007, and six burrows in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{parents also}} took turns feeding their chick. According to one account, the chick {{was covered with}} grey down. The young bird took <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> weeks to mature enough to abandon the nest and land for the water, {{typically}} around the middle of July. The parents cared for their young after they fledged, and adults would be seen swimming with their young perched on their backs. Great auks matured sexually when they were four to seven years old.|$|E
5|$|At 22:30 the fog {{lifted and}} Kouma {{saw that a}} North Korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river {{directly}} in front of his position. Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed, and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.|$|E
5000|$|Alves {{called the}} early telenovelas aired in the 1950s [...] "simpler" [...] than today's series, since the shows were <b>only</b> {{broadcast}} <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> times per week, rather than airing daily episodes.|$|R
60|$|The ashy gray of the colonel's face sufficed to tell Lisle {{that the}} end was, indeed, near at hand. The colonel <b>only</b> spoke <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> times and, at ten o'clock at night, passed away painlessly.|$|R

5|$|The main {{problems}} were {{the pressure of}} time and the desire of the U.S. president for secrecy. The Cambodian monsoon, whose heavy rains would hamper operations, was only two months away. By the order of the president, the State Department did not notify the Cambodian desk at the US Embassy, Saigon, the Phnom Penh embassy, or Lon Nol of the planning. Operational security was as tight as General Abrams could make it. There was to be no prior U.S. logistical build-up in the border regions which might serve as a signal to the communists. U.S. brigade commanders were informed only a week in advance of the offensive, while battalion commanders got <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> days' notice.|$|E
5|$|General panic now {{seized the}} Allied army and it {{abandoned}} {{the field in}} all possible directions. A famous episode occurred during this retreat: Russian forces that had been defeated by the French right withdrew south towards Vienna via the Satschan frozen ponds. French artillery pounded towards the men, and the ice was broken due to the bombardment. The men drowned in the cold ponds, dozens of Russian artillery pieces going down with them. Estimates of how many guns were captured differ: {{there may have been}} as few as 38 or more than 100. Sources also differ about casualties, with figures ranging between 200 and 2,000 dead. Many drowning Russians were saved by their victorious foes. However, local evidence, only later made public, suggests that Napoleon's account of the catastrophe may have been totally invented; on his instructions the lakes were drained {{a few days after the}} battle and the corpses of <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> men, with some 150 horses, were found.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the mid-19th}} century, {{the area around}} Kalimpong was ruled in {{succession}} by the Sikkimese and Bhutanese kingdoms. Under Sikkimese rule, the area was known as Dalingkot. In 1706, the king of Bhutan won this territory from the Sikkimese monarch and renamed it Kalimpong. Overlooking the Teesta Valley, Kalimpong {{is believed to have}} once been the forward position of the Bhutanese in the 18th century. The area was sparsely populated by the indigenous Lepcha community and migrant Bhutia and Limbu tribes. Later in 1780, the Gurkhas of Nepal invaded and conquered Kalimpong. After the Anglo-Bhutan War in 1864, the Treaty of Sinchula (1865) was signed, in which Bhutanese held territory east of the Teesta River was ceded to the British East India Company. At that time, Kalimpong was a hamlet, with <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> families known to reside there. The first recorded mention of the town was a fleeting reference made that year by Ashley Eden, a government official with the Bengal Civil Service. Kalimpong was added to district of Darjeeling in 1866. In 1866–1867 an Anglo-Bhutanese commission demarcated the common boundaries between the two, thereby giving shape to the Kalimpong subdivision and the Darjeeling district.|$|E

25|$|If {{one assumes}} the {{rotations}} are completely randomly distributed, then {{the probability that}} they end up in <b>only</b> <b>two</b> (<b>or</b> <b>three)</b> signs is very small. This suggests that these rotations might be deliberate.|$|E

U.S. participants were more likely to charge up every night.|$|E
25|$|Mars, {{under the}} command of Captain Count Van Bijland, was the only Dutch warship in the roadstead. Because she was grossly outnumbered and outgunned, she fired <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> pro-forma shots. Two of the British ships shot at Mars and Van Bijland then {{answered}} with his cannons. Rodney reprimanded the captains responsible for this lack of discipline.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of the 1930s saw a decline in the {{domestic}} film industry in Korea. Censorship and oppression {{on the part of the}} occupying authorities played a part in reducing the number of films produced at this time to <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> per year, and some filmmakers fled Korea for the more robust film-industry in Shanghai at this time.|$|E

25|$|The {{central section}} or upper {{sections}} of many large ultramafic intrusions are poorly layered, massive gabbro. This is because as the magma differentiates it reaches a composition favouring crystallisation of <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> minerals; the magma {{may also have}} cooled by this stage sufficiently for the increasing viscosity of the magma to halt effective convection, or convection may stop or break up into inefficient small cells because the revervoir becomes too thin and flat.|$|E
25|$|The {{fishing was}} {{actually}} carried out in small boats, carrying <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> fishermen. Many of these small boats would {{be lost in the}} fog and never returned to the ship. As technology evolved, the three-mast boats disappeared, giving way to steamers, then to diesel-engined vessels. These days, only a small fishing fleet survives, restricted to fishing around coastal waters. In the harbour, pleasure-boats have taken the place of all but a few fishing-boats.|$|E
