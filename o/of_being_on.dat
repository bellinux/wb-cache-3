5|$|As {{an obsessive}} new mother {{who has spent}} many an hour {{hovering}} over my son with a thermometer and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't {{want to go out}} for dinner with Adam because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew in the care of their best friend's children's nanny was just one niggling implausibility too far. After three months <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E
5|$|Bond again {{encounters}} Goodhead in Venice {{where he}} is chased through the canals by Drax's henchmen. He discovers a secret biological laboratory, and learns that the glass vials are to hold a nerve gas deadly to humans, but harmless to animals. Chang attacks Bond and is killed; during the fight, Bond finds evidence that Drax is moving his operation to Rio de Janeiro. Rejoining Goodhead, he deduces {{that she is a}} CIA agent spying on Drax. Bond has saved one of the vials he found earlier, as the only evidence of the now-empty laboratory; he gives it to M for analysis, who permits him to go to Rio de Janeiro under the pretence <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> leave.|$|E
5|$|The German Army halted its offensives in July. The King's 11th Battalion disbanded in April, {{followed}} in May by the temporary {{consolidation of the}} Liverpool Pals as the 17th (Composite) Battalion. Their brief unity ended in May when they reduced to form training cadres for the U.S. 137th Regiment. In August, after four months <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> the defensive, the Allies launched an offensive against Amiens, in the Somme area. Meticulous preparation gave them {{the element of surprise}} when it began on the 8th. More than 16,000 prisoners were taken within two hours and the German frontline mostly collapsed. In the following Battle of Albert, begun on the 21st, the 13th King's suffered 274 casualties, but captured 150 soldiers and many machine-guns, while the 1st assisted in the taking of Ervillers.|$|E
5000|$|Why doesn't Gettier's {{principle}} (PDJ) {{hold in the}} evidential situation he has described? You multiply your risks <b>of</b> <b>being</b> {{wrong when}} you believe a conjunction. The most elementary theory of probability indicates that Smith's prospects <b>of</b> <b>being</b> right <b>on</b> both (1) and (2), namely, <b>of</b> <b>being</b> right <b>on</b> (3), {{are bound to be}} less favorable than his prospects <b>of</b> <b>being</b> right <b>on</b> either (1) or (2). In fact, Smith's chances <b>of</b> <b>being</b> right <b>on</b> (3) might not come up to the minimum standard of justification which (1) and (2) barely satisfy, and Smith would be unjustified in accepting (3).|$|R

40|$|Do better {{informed}} people vote more? Recent theories of voter turnout emphasize {{a positive effect}} <b>of</b> <b>being</b> informed <b>on</b> the propensity to vote, but the possibility of endogenous information acquisition makes estimation of causal effects difficult.

Four of fifteen districts carried out a pilot project, exogenously making pilot city district voters more informed {{about the effects of}} decentralization.

25|$|The film {{performed}} {{well at the}} box office, grossing an estimated $10 million by 1977. Despite this, the film was reviewed negatively by critics for its perceived amateurish production and self-indulgent content, with the fantasy sequences in particular coming in {{for some of the}} harshest criticism. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where the band had not performed live for over two years as a result <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> tax exile. The band were thus unable to promote themselves at home, leaving them out of the public spotlight.|$|E

The postage stamps of India and Hong Kong were used on some mail, but they were probably carried there by individuals, instead <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> sale in Labuan. Mail was routed through Singapore. From 1867, Labuan officially used the postage stamps of the Straits Settlements but began issuing its own in May 1879.|$|E

25|$|In October 1958, Tebbetts {{was hired}} as an {{executive}} vice president for the Milwaukee Braves. He served in the Braves front office from 1959 through September 1961, but found that he missed the excitement <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> the playing field. When the team fired Chuck Dressen in September 1961, Tebbetts returned to managing for the last month of the season. Ironically, his former team, the Cincinnati Reds, would win the National League pennant that year. Despite having talented players like Hank Aaron, Eddie Mathews, Joe Adcock, Warren Spahn, and Lew Burdette, Tebbetts could only manage a fifth-place finish in 1962.|$|E

25|$|The {{vigorous}} {{campaign of}} mine warfare waged by the French and Germans was continued by the British, exploiting the advantage <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>on</b> the dip slope and only having to dig horizontally into the ridge to undermine German positions. The Germans, on the steeper scarp slope, had to dig down {{before they could}} dig horizontally, which added to the German disadvantage in manpower and mining equipment. An attack was planned by the Germans to capture the British positions from which mine galleries were being dug under the German defences. Success would gain more defensive depth and forestall mine attacks on the German positions before the British {{had been able to}} organise their defences on the ridge.|$|E
