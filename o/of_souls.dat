[...] Hor believes that the mummies are the <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> the gods: he describes the ibis as the <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Toth and the hawk as the <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> many different gods. That is to say, some animals were, or contained, a ba- a part <b>of</b> the <b>soul</b> that is an active agents in this world and the spiritual world. Therefore, votive animal mummies are the animals' souls acted as messengers between people on earth and the gods.|$|R

Sallah informs them that Belloq and the Nazis are digging for the Well <b>of</b> <b>Souls</b> with {{a replica of the}} {{headpiece}} (created from the scar on Toht's hand). They quickly realize the Nazi headpiece is incomplete and that the Nazis are digging in the wrong place. The Nazis kidnap Marion and it appears to Jones that she is killed in an exploding truck. After a confrontation with Belloq in a local bar, Indy and Sallah infiltrate the Nazi dig site and use their staff to correctly locate the Ark.

50|$|Jains define godliness as the {{inherent}} quality <b>of</b> any <b>soul</b> characterizing infinite bliss, infinite power, Perfect knowledge and Perfect peace. However, these qualities <b>of</b> a <b>soul</b> are subdued due to karmas <b>of</b> the <b>soul.</b> One who achieves this state <b>of</b> <b>soul</b> through right belief, right knowledge and right conduct can be termed as god. This perfection <b>of</b> <b>soul</b> is called Kaivalya or Bodhi. A liberated soul thus becomes a god - liberated of miseries, cycles of rebirth, world, karmas and finally liberated of body as well. This is called nirvana or moksha.|$|R

While {{there are}} men and boys who are trafficked around the world, the United States Department of State (DoS) estimates that about 80% of human trafficking victims are female, and the film focuses on them.

5|$|Nefarious: Merchant <b>of</b> <b>Souls</b> is a 2011 American {{documentary}} film about modern human trafficking, specifically sexual slavery.

Several former prostitutes talk about their conversion to Christianity, escape from sexual oppression, and subsequent education or marriage. The film ends with the assertion that only Jesus can completely heal people from the horrors of sexual slavery.|$|E
40|$|Frecska et al. Soul Cluster The paper {{presents}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} theories on conceptions <b>of</b> <b>soul</b> in indigenous and early European traditions.

Another observation is that the described pluralism, the number <b>of</b> <b>soul</b> components and their attributes go through speculative changes as the tradition moves away of tribal origins, which have the shamanic state of consciousness as experiential source of knowledge instead of scholarly theorization. A three-network model of human experience is drawn to support the tripartition cum trilocation concept <b>of</b> <b>soul...</b>|$|R
