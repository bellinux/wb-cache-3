25|$|You write: „in {{order to}} avoid {{unnecessary}} bloodshed“. Who {{is the cause of}} this bloodshed? We or you? Leaving you country, in spite of its enormous magnitude, you are robbers that broke into our territory, plundering and killing us mercilessly. We have never thought of doing such things to you, but you have invaded our land, astonishing us with this murderous diabolical countenance, making us stubbornly resist, not for us to lose our independence and autonomy, trying to keep our golden will and freedom in <b>our</b> <b>hands.</b> We are not internally at war, and we will defend ourselves from you, the same way wild beasts defend themselves against attackers, and I will say to you strictly, that we are all to lay down with our bones, as its unanimous that we will rather die than surrendering our fotress to you voluntarily. You point Aslanduz to me out, where your „two-thousand large detachment“ supposedly defeated our „thirty-thousand large army“. Shame on you, General, to lie, you should speak the truth, without hiding the real facts of how it ended there, and you shouldn't brag about that particular victory of you over us, which was thanks to the despicable betrayal of our troops. If you forgot about this outrageous event, I shall remind you, fueling anger and hostility towards Abbas Mirza for his strict handling his soldiers wanted to take revenge on him, by raising the white flag amongst 10,500 soldiers, and voluntarily gave themselves up, laid down their weapons and hoped to receive salvation from you; but instead, you disarmed them, without conscience and compassion, and watched how your soldiers killed then thousand of them, leaving alive only 500 people as a trophy of victory. Shame and disgrace. It is a worthy lesson as traitors are oath breakers, {{but at the same time}} a good warning for the rest of the treacherous soldiers, lest they be deceived and deceived by your cunning and false promises. And after these vile barbaric executions committed by you on innocent people who voluntarily handed down themselves to you, you dare to speak of love for man. I feel sorry for your brave soldiers serving as blind tools to achieve your robbers goals: but your boss will only reward you as the commander, with decorations, medals and even large sums of money for the heroic and courageous deed of your brave soldiers, whom it will bypass.|$|E

30|$|We {{evaluate}} <b>our</b> cascaded <b>hand</b> segmentation method on {{two types}} of egocentric data which correspond to different levels of human-computer interaction. The first type contains the both hands are exposed with little varying gesture and interacting with objects, such as holding a cup. The second type contains the hands performing gestures, such as virtual keyboard typing, without directly interacting with any object. We firstly compare <b>our</b> cascaded <b>hand</b> segmentation with the state-of-the-art methods and analyze the validity of our framework. Then, we illustrate that the egocentric human-computer interaction can benefit from <b>our</b> <b>hand</b> segmentation approach.|$|R
