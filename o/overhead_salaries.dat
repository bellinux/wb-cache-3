To do this, Kalecki assumes that industries compete in imperfectly competitive markets, more particularly in oligopolistic markets where firms set a mark-up on their variable average costs (raw materials, wages of employees {{on the shop floor}} that are supposed to be variable) in order to cover their <b>overhead</b> costs (<b>salaries</b> to senior management and administration), to obtain a certain amount of profit. The mark-up fixed by firms is higher or lower depending on the degree of monopoly, or the ease with which firms can raise price without causing reduction in the quantity demanded.This can be summarized in the following equation: ...|$|R

This study attempts to present a historical perspective of the factors leading to {{the development of the}}se concepts, within both the civilian and military health care sectors. Once this background is developed, a description of the current personnel resources of the Military Health Care System is presented. Given this information, the study then places its major emphasis on the cost implications for the Military Health Care System in utilizing these non-physician providers. The study identifies four major cost demands: <b>salary,</b> <b>overhead,</b> training, and supervision.

40|$|Our study compares {{chemical}} {{production costs}} in the EU and other countries to understand if these costs are higher {{in the case of}} Europe. Our analysis focuses on light olefins (ethylene and propylene), as ethylene is the largest value petrochemical commodity produced globally. The countries selected for comparison are USA, Russia, Ukraine and Saudi Arabia, since they have high shares of extra-EU 28 trade. A bottom-up approach has been followed, based on information at facility level, including 122 steam cracking facilities (the primary process for producing olefins) and 224 facilities producing only propylene. Taking into consideration the complex differences in technologies and co-products between operators, costs are broken down to six components: 1) Feedstock, 2) Credits (due to co-products), 3) Electricity, 4) Thermal energy 5) Other materials (chemicals, catalysts etc.) and 6) Labour and other costs (<b>salaries,</b> <b>overheads</b> etc.). Our findings suggest that although interesting observations emerge in each of these components, overall costs compare more favourably between the countries than initially thought. JRC.

50|$|The {{committee}} {{came into}} being as Joseph Stalin lost interest in the Comintern and largely left the various communist parties to raise their own revenues, {{while at the same}} time, supply routes from Moscow to Bucharest were becoming ever more uncertain in the face of Nazi Germany's rise and tightened security along the Dniester River. It helped keep the party alive, funding safe houses, <b>salaries,</b> <b>overhead,</b> aid to several hundred prisoners and their families, lawyers and bribes for judges, policemen, prison wardens and guards. Nevertheless, the Comintern was critical of its involvement in business affairs, with Wilhelm Pieck cautioning against bourgeois financiers influencing the party's policies. In 1942, the party raised 17.4 million lei, a sum that would rise to almost 30 million in 1943 and 46 million in 1944, until the August coup that ushered in the party's legalization. Most of the funds came from Jewish industrialists, with other money given by pro-English figures or businessmen who expected an Allied victory in the ongoing World War II.|$|R
30|$|A {{third way}} that {{overseas}} work visas differ from traditional programs {{to assist the}} poor lies in their unusually direct targeting of beneficiaries. Easterly and Williamson (2011, Table 3) find that 29 % of foreign aid is spent on agency <b>overhead</b> and staff <b>salaries.</b> Action Aid (2011, p. 43) estimates that roughly half of all official development assistance does not reach the poor—for reasons that include being spent in the donor country or being spent to buy donor country goods and services at inflated prices. And of the fraction of aid that does reach the poor, a substantial portion does not raise the incomes of the poor {{by more than one}} dollar for each dollar of aid (Blattman and Niehaus 2014). Income earned by Haitian seasonal workers in the USA, however, goes directly to a Haitian household. More than 85 % of this amount is eventually brought or transferred to Haiti—the average fraction reported by the seven workers in Alabama—and spent in Haiti by a poor family. It is difficult to identify a program of traditional aid or international charity that targets the direct benefit of poor families with similar efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|In 1986 Santagati {{moved from}} NYNEX to Gaston & Snow, {{which was then}} Boston's largest law firm. He {{initially}} became the Chief Operating Officer. Though it was then an unusual step for a law firm to put a non-lawyer in a high-profile executive role, he later became the CEO of the company. During his tenure at Gaston & Snow the legal fees, <b>overhead,</b> and lawyer <b>salaries</b> skyrocketed, {{as was the case}} at many of their competitors. In the early 1990s Gaston & Snow's finances rapidly deteriorated and they were forced to lay off employees. Gaston & Snow filed for bankruptcy in October 1991. Some of the factors that caused the bankruptcy include heavy debt, the loss of partners, and conflict between executives. The Boston Globe referred to it as [...] "worst implosion of a Boston law firm in history". Some blamed Santagati for Gaston & Snow's failure. One of the bankruptcy trustees accused him of [...] "fraud, negligence and breach of fiduciary duty". The allegations also included charges that he [...] "manipulated the firm's internal systems to boost his own compensation, standing and business reputation". Many Boston lawyers argued, however, that the bankruptcy was the fault of senior lawyers at Gaston & Snow. Santagati's defenders contend that some lawyers who were already the highest paid employees of the firm insisted on higher pay and blocked plans to rescue the company.|$|R

40|$|A high-intensity {{snowstorm}} (> 1 m snow and> 8 cm {{water in}} 2 days) produced widespread avalanching in Colorado's northern San Juan Mountains during early March, 1992. While the Colorado Department of Transportation (COOT) {{was attempting to}} rescue stranded motorists and close Highway 550 two CDOT employees were caught and buried 40 m north of the East Riverside avalanche shed, approximately 8 km south of Ouray. One of the employees died. Although Highway 550 is crossed by about 60 avalanche paths, the last six fatalities have occurred at the East Riverside in four separate accidents in 1963, 1970, 1978, and 1992. The State of Colorado is considering two options to reduce avalanche hazard on Highway 550 : (a) an approximately 80 m-long northward extension of the existing shed, and (b) hiring two full-time forecasters during the November-April period each season. The shed extension would require a front-end, one-time expenditure of approximately $ 3, 000, 000, would decrease the hazard in the East Riverside to {{less than half the}} present level, but would only reduce the avalanche hazard over the entire Highway by roughly 5 %. Assuming a long-term interest rate of 8 % and an amortization period of 30 years, the shed would be financed by a constant annual payment of $ 266, 490. Total "mortgage " cost over 30 years, therefore, would be $ 7, 994, 700. The forecast program, including <b>salary,</b> <b>overhead,</b> instrumentation, transportation and other expenses, would cost an estimated $ 100, 000 per year and would reduce the hazard over the entire highway by an estimated 50 %. If this annual cost also inflates at an 8 % rate over 30 years, the total cost would be $ 11, 328, 322. The forecast program, therefore would cost 1. 42 times the shed cost over 30 years, but would provide roughly 10 times the hazard reduction...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} relationship between cost strategies, regulatory environment, and firm performance, focusing on community banks in Nebraska. This study sought to test theories espoused in the empirical literatures of strategic management and economics which stress the impact of overhead expenses on firm performance, particularly in competitive business environments. ^ This research focused on the effect of deregulation of the banking industry, and control of overhead costs as a strategy for dealing with the increased competition precipitated by deregulation. Community bank performance was measured by return on average assets. Cost strategies were operationalized by using measures of <b>overhead</b> costs, specifically, <b>salary</b> expense, occupancy expense, and an 2 ̆ 7 other expenses 2 ̆ 7 category that is common to the banking industry. Environment was operationalized as a time function representing the regulation years (1977 - 1979), and deregulation years (1983 - 1985). ^ Data was analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance, multiple regression/correlation analysis, and cross-lagged panel correlations. Also, qualitative interviews were conducted with a number of bank practitioners to clarify certain points raised by the quantitative analyses. ^ The results of this project dispute the aspects of the strategic management and economics literatures which hold that cost control strategies are a more effective business strategy in highly competitive industry environments than in a noncompetitive setting. However, the results confirm the strategic management literature as to the importance and impact of cost control strategies on firm performance, regardless of competitive circumstances. ^ These findings indicate that more research is needed in small business and service industries to determine how the 2 ̆ 7 rules of the game 2 ̆ 7, as developed in industrial settings and set out in the empirical strategic management literature, apply to small business in the service industries. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{world is}} facing an {{overwhelming}} number of social and environmental challenges that necessitate immediate, collaborative action. Despite numerous efforts, campaigns, and calls for action, tractable change in the public's response is sluggish. Therefore, we need {{a better understanding of}} the barriers to and motivators for action (e. g., prosocial behavior, resource conservation). This dissertation is a first step to addressing this as it explores individuals' prosocial choices and behaviors, as well as certain factors underlying them within the domains of charitable giving, pro-environmental choice, and climate change judgments. The first two chapters provide an account of individuals' aversion to overhead in charitable giving. Chapter 1 describes how higher overhead spending decreases giving and that overhead aversion is largely explained by a decrease in the perceived impact of one's donation. A large field experiment demonstrates that covering overhead costs with outside funds significantly increases giving compared to traditional fundraising techniques. Chapter 2 focuses on nonprofit executive (CEO) pay, a particularly aversive type of <b>overhead.</b> As the <b>salary</b> of a nonprofit CEO increases, the likelihood that individuals will donate decreases. Moreover, individuals are willing to "undercut" a qualified CEO by offering him/ her significantly less money for a job if the organization is described as a nonprofit versus a for profit. Chapters 3 and 4 explore underlying factors that increase consumers' choice of green products and shed light on the psychology involved in climate change judgments. Chapter 3 finds that green choice is largely and consistently explained by real-time accessibility of eco-friendly concepts [...] -exposing individuals to green concepts prior to making a decision increases the likelihood they choose green products. Chapter 4 delves into the local warming effect, a phenomenon in which perceived abnormalities in current outdoor temperature influence climate change judgments. Results suggest the local warming effect arises due to attribute substitution, whereby individuals use accessible but irrelevant information over harder to process but more diagnostic information in making their judgments. This body of work improves our understanding of individuals' motivators and barriers to action in areas of critical global concern [...] -charitable behavior, resource conservation, and climate change actio...|$|R
