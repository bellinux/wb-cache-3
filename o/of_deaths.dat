40|$|Abstract Background There is {{analytical}} {{potential for}} multiple cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> {{data collected from}} death certificates. This study examines relationships of multiple causes <b>of</b> <b>death</b> {{as a function of}} factors available on the <b>death</b> certificate (demographics <b>of</b> decedent, place <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> type <b>of</b> certifier, disposal method, whether an autopsy was performed, and year <b>of</b> <b>death).</b> Methods Data from 326, 332 Minnesota death certificates from 1990 – 1998 are examined. Underlying and non-underlying causes <b>of</b> <b>death</b> are examined (based on record axis codes) as well as demographic and death-related covariates. Associations between covariates and prevalence of multiple causes <b>of</b> <b>death</b> and conditional probability of underlying compared to non-underlying causes <b>of</b> <b>death</b> are examined. The occurrence of ischemic heart disease or diabetes as underlying causes are specifically examined. Results Both the probability of multiple causes <b>of</b> <b>death</b> and the proportion of underlying cause compared to non-underlying cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> are associated with demographic characteristics of the deceased and other non-medical conditions related to filing death certificate such as place <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> Conclusions Multiple cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> data provide a potentially useful way of looking for inaccuracies in reporting <b>of</b> causes <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> Differences across demographics in the proportion of time a cause is selected as underlying compared to non-underlying exist and can potentially provide useful information about the overall impact <b>of</b> causes <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in different populations. </p...|$|R

40|$|Valid and {{reliable}} {{statistics on the}} cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> is an essential input for setting of priorities in the health sector (Mahapatra, 1999). As is generally known, most developed cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> reporting systems rely on medical certification <b>of</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> using a well defined system of classification. The International classification <b>of</b> causes <b>of</b> <b>death</b> (ICD) released by WHO {{from time to time}} is usually followed as such or with suitable adaptations to specific country settings. The 10 th revision of the ICD (ICD 10) is the latest instance of this kind (WHO, 1993). Most developed cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> reporting systems have invariably achieved near total coverage. In other words a cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> report is invariable filed by the medical attendant for all deaths in such countries. Developing countries like India have to depend on lay reporting of the cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> for rural areas, where adequate medical facilities are not available. However, usability of the cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> statistics is questioned in view of poor coverage, and poor compliance with cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> reporting, coding and classification. The importance of a good cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> reporting system to inform public health policy has been described elsewhere (Mahapatra, 1999). Details of the verbal autopsy- based cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> reporting systems in rural areas of India has been reviewed (Mahapatra, 2000). In this paper, we examine the cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> reporting system in terms of the usability <b>of</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> statistics generated by it. We start with {{a brief description of the}} cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> reporting system in India. Thereafter we define the characteristics of an usable cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> reporting system. We identify nine criteria, based on a review of literature and our own assessmen...|$|R

5|$|The smog {{event of}} 1966 {{was preceded by}} two other major smog episodes in New York City: one in November 1953, and one in January–February 1963. Using {{statistical}} analysis that compares the number <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> during periods of smog with the number <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> {{during the same time}} in other years, medical scientists led by Leonard Greenburg were able to determine that excess deaths occurred during those smogs, from which it can be inferred that the smog caused or contributed to those deaths. An estimated 220–240 deaths were caused by the six-day 1953 smog, and an estimated 300–405 deaths were caused by the two-week 1963 smog. Other episodes of smog had occurred in the city prior to 1966, but were not accompanied by significant excess deaths.|$|E
