This technique has always been subject to criticism for its lack of theoretical basis. This paper presents a critical assessment of the methods suggested by Dunn (1960) and by Esteban-Marquillas (1972) and proposes a new shift-share method, which separates out the two eﬀects unambiguously. By way of illustration, we provide an application to manufacturing employment in the Belgian provinces between 1995 and 2007. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Results show that being Indigenous significantly reduces the length of sentenced prison term in the lower courts but has no significant effect at the higher court level. Further, evidence of interactive effects by Indigenous status was scant. Only age differed significantly between Indigenous and non-Indigenous offenders at both court levels.

2500|$|While Cass and Shell's 1983 paper [...] {{defined the}} term sunspot {{in the context}} of general equilibrium, their use of the term sunspot (a term {{originally}} used in astronomy) alludes to the earlier econometric work of William Stanley Jevons, who explored the correlation between the degree of sunspot activity and the price of corn. In Jevons' work, uncertainty about sunspots could be considered intrinsic, for example, if sunspots have some demonstrable effect on agricultural productivity, or some <b>other</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>variable.</b> In modern economics, the term does not indicate any relationship with solar phenomena, and is instead used to describe random variables that have no impact on the preferences, allocations, or production technology of a general equilibrium model. The modern theory suggests that such a nonfundamental variable might have an effect on equilibrium outcomes if it influences expectations.|$|R
40|$|If {{the goal}} is to measure the causal {{relation}} between two variables when a third is involved and plays the role of mediator, it is essential to explicitly define the relational assumptions among these and <b>others</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>variables.</b> However if any of this assumptions are not met, estimates of mediated effects may be affected by bias. One example where this occurs is the widely discussed situation known as the Birth Weight paradox which arises when birth weight is the mediator of interest and unmeasured confounders affect the mediator-outcome relation. In this paper we will focus on a setting where such paradox might arise where birth order act as the exposure for childhood asthma (by age 1. 5).

50|$|There {{are many}} {{limitations}} to perceptual mapping. The largest {{is the number}} of variables used. Traditionally, the map uses two variables and does not account for others. This assumption can hinder the reliability of results, as in some cases, it is not safe to assume that there are only two major factors influencing the decision of purchase for a consumer. For example, a graph may use quality of food and pricing, but not take into account <b>other</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>variables</b> such as the number of visits and locations. Also, there is often a blurred line between what a business can offer and what a consumer thinks the business can offer. This could be due to miscommunication, lack of knowledge, impact from social media, and so on. These untruths can influence the result, creating a slight bias in the statistics. Another limitation is data gathering. The data needed to form a perceptual map is usually obtained through surveys, and can be difficult to obtain. The range of behaviours that the map covers is also a constraint, as the limitation to two variables means that its application works mainly with purchase decisions made with little thought and effort, such as purchasing a beverage at a store or going to a fast food restaurant.|$|E

Governments in developing countries can significantly promote FDI by introducing appropriate institutional reforms and macroeconomic policies.|$|R

While none of these results is statistically significant in the OLS models, it is worth noticing that data suggest a positive time trend for monovarietal oils, with significant coefficients in the RE model. This result {{is in line with}} previous works exploring different datasets (Cacchiarelli et al. 2016). As for the presence of local olive varieties, this generates a significant PP only in 2012.|$|R

40|$|Economists {{are rarely}} {{satisfied}} with evidence that something works in practice. They {{tend to be}} more interested in whether it works in theory. In the case of monetary policy at low (or zero) inflation, the now famous theoretical conjecture is John Maynard Keynes 2 ̆ 7 s claim that when inflation is low and market interest rates are below 2 percent, monetary policy might be incapable of changing the interest rate, price level, or any <b>other</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>variable.</b> He gave the problem a name, liquidity trap. Paul Krugman and Takatoshi Ito conjecture that Japan is now in a liquidity trap, because short-term interest rates are near zero. Larry Summers argued a related proposition — that zero inflation is socially costly because it sets a lower bound for nominal interest rates. Monetary policy becomes ineffective: It cannot lower the short-term nominal rate or prevent falling prices from raising the real rate of interest. With money wages less than fully flexible, unemployment rises. The central bank is powerless to lower the short-term nominal interest rate once it reaches (or approaches) zero...|$|R
