5|$|As Enterprise {{travels through}} the Delphic Expanse, {{the ship is}} damaged by {{destructive}} spatial anomalies. With most of the primary systems <b>off-line,</b> Ensign Mayweather notices another ship nearby but no life-signs are detected. Captain Archer leads Lieutenant Reed and several MACOs on an away mission, and discover the crew are all dead. Taking what they can, they return and resume their mission.|$|E
5|$|The Tor Project {{recommended}} that Tor relay operators and hidden service operators revoke and generate fresh keys after patching OpenSSL, but noted that Tor relays use {{two sets of}} keys and that Tor's multi-hop design minimizes the impact of exploiting a single relay. 586 relays later found to be susceptible to the Heartbleed bug were taken <b>off-line</b> as a precautionary measure.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) {{is in the}} holosuite {{playing a}} secret agent program in the 1960s. Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson) intrudes and convinces Bashir to let him tag along. Meanwhile, Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks), Lt Cmdr. Worf (Michael Dorn), Lt. Cmdr. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell), Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor), and Chief Petty Officer Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) are on a runabout, {{returning}} to Deep Space Nine. As they arrive they find that their vessel has been sabotaged and that a warp core breach is imminent. Lt. Cmdr. Michael Eddington beams them out, but the ship is destroyed during transport and Eddington is forced to store their patterns while he repairs the transporter, but doing so uses {{almost all of the}} station's memory, putting many station systems <b>off-line.</b> Their physical patterns end up in the computer controlling the holosuite, where they appear as characters in Bashir's program.|$|E
5|$|Webber took {{provisional}} {{pole position}} in Friday qualifying of the , out-qualifying local driver Rubens Barrichello by 0.138 seconds during a rain-affected session. He continued his good {{performance in the}} Saturday session taking a career-best 3rd on the grid, Jaguar Racing's best qualifying performance in their four-year Formula One history. In the race, which was hit heavily by rain, Webber was in seventh place when he attempted to cool his tyres by driving through a puddle lying <b>off-line</b> in the final corner. The resultant lack of grip caused Webber to crash heavily into the pit straight walls, leaving debris on the track which caused a second major crash; Fernando Alonso hitting a stray tyre. The race was subsequently red-flagged, and although Webber was originally classified in 7th, an FIA investigation found a timekeeping error which meant that Webber was placed 9th in the re-classification.|$|E

25|$|The {{debate between}} the {{benefits}} of on-line versus <b>off-line</b> strategies continues to be contended.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Off-line</b> {{strategy}} {{determines the}} best patient position through accumulated data gathered during treatment sessions, almost always initial treatments. Physicians and staff measure {{the accuracy of}} treatment and devise treatment guidelines during using information from the images. The strategy requires greater coordination than on-line strategies. However, the use of <b>off-line</b> strategies does {{reduce the risk of}} systematic error. The risk of random error may still persist, however.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} {{correction}} strategies used while determining the most beneficial patient position and beam structure: on-line and <b>off-line</b> correction. Both serve their purposes in the clinical setting, and have their own merits. Generally, {{a combination of the}} both strategies is employed. Often, a patient will receive corrections to their treatment via on-line strategies during their first radiation session, and physicians make subsequent adjustments <b>off-line</b> during check film rounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{policy is}} not like the real world, because real names and {{personal}} information are not known {{to everyone in the}} <b>off-line</b> world.|$|E

25|$|With the {{introduction}} of host card emulation (HCE) and near field communication (NFC) technology for mobile applications, traditional contactless smart cards for prepaid and loyalty programs are emulated in a smartphone. Google Wallet adopted these technologies for mobile <b>off-line</b> payment application.|$|E
25|$|Google collates {{business}} listings {{from multiple}} on-line and <b>off-line</b> sources. To reduce duplication in the index, Google's algorithm combines listings automatically based on address, phone number, or geocode, but sometimes information for separate businesses will be inadvertently merged with each other, resulting in listings inaccurately incorporating elements from multiple businesses.|$|E
25|$|Online {{infidelity}} {{can be just}} as {{damaging to}} a relationship as offline physical unfaithfulness. A possible explanation is that our brain registers virtual and physical acts the same way and responds similarly. Several studies have concluded that online infidelity, whether sexual or emotional in nature, often leads to <b>off-line</b> infidelity.|$|E
25|$|The major {{advantage}} of <b>off-line</b> over the on-line {{system is that}} the user's smartphone {{does not have to}} be online, and the transaction is fast. In addition, multiple emulated cards can be stored in a smartphone to support multi-merchant loyalty programs. The user does not need to carry many physical cards anymore.|$|E
25|$|By March 2012, {{one year}} after the disaster, all but two of Japan's nuclear {{reactors}} were shut down; some were damaged by the quake and tsunami. The following year, the last two were taken <b>off-line.</b> Authority to restart the others after scheduled maintenance throughout the year was given to local governments, and in all cases local opposition prevented restarting.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{approaches}} {{consider the}} use of high-quality microscopy images over which a statistical classification algorithm is used to perform automated cell detection and counting as an image analysis task. Generally performs with a constant error rate as an <b>off-line</b> (batch) type process. A range of image classification techniques can be employed for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|Chancellor Angela Merkel's {{coalition}} {{announced on}} May 30, 2011, that Germany’s 17 nuclear power stations will {{be shut down}} by 2022, in a policy reversal following Japan's Fukushima I nuclear accidents. Seven of the German power stations were closed temporarily in March, and they will remain <b>off-line</b> and be permanently decommissioned. An eighth was already off line, and will stay so.|$|E
25|$|BlackBerry also {{supports}} polling email, through third-party applications. The messaging system {{built into the}} BlackBerry only understands how to receive messages from a BES or the BIS, these services handle the connections to the user's mail providers. Device storage also enables the mobile user to access all data <b>off-line</b> in areas without wireless service. When the user reconnects to wireless service, the BES sends the latest data.|$|E
25|$|Some systems use Null Current systems (also {{sometimes}} called Null Flux systems). These use a coil that is wound {{so that it}} enters two opposing, alternating fields, so that the average flux in the loop is zero. When the vehicle is in the straight ahead position, no current flows, but any moves <b>off-line</b> create flux that generates a field that naturally pushes/pulls it back into line.|$|E
25|$|German Chancellor Angela Merkel's {{coalition}} {{announced on}} May 30, 2011, that Germany’s 17 nuclear power stations will {{be shut down}} by 2022, in a policy reversal following Japan's Fukushima I nuclear accidents and anti-nuclear protests within Germany. Seven of the German power stations were closed temporarily in March, and they will remain <b>off-line</b> and be permanently decommissioned. An eighth was already off line, and will stay so.|$|E
25|$|The {{condenser}} {{tubes are}} made of brass or stainless steel to resist corrosion from either side. Nevertheless, they may become internally fouled during operation by bacteria or algae in the cooling water or by mineral scaling, all of which inhibit heat transfer and reduce thermodynamic efficiency. Many plants include an automatic cleaning system that circulates sponge rubber balls through the tubes to scrub them clean without {{the need to take}} the system <b>off-line.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Heartbleed OpenSSL bug {{disrupted}} the Tor network {{for several days}} in April 2014 while private keys were renewed. The Tor Project recommended that Tor relay operators and hidden service operators revoke and generate fresh keys after patching OpenSSL, but noted that Tor relays use two sets of keys and that Tor's multi-hop design minimizes the impact of exploiting a single relay. 586 relays later found to be susceptible to the Heartbleed bug were taken <b>off-line</b> as a precautionary measure.|$|E
25|$|At version 3.0 , Immunet Free offers {{protection}} {{based upon}} the virus definitions in the cloud, and an option to include the ClamAV <b>off-line</b> virus definitions for use when not connected to the Internet. Immunet advises that the free version be used alongside another antivirus program, and supports several particular such programs {{in the sense that}} they co-install properly and work in tandem during normal operations without any obvious interference or resource drag. This is a significant difference between Immunet and other contemporary antivirus products.|$|E
25|$|With {{high speed}} data acquisition, and {{sub-micron}} resolution, OCT is adaptable to perform both inline and <b>off-line.</b> Due {{to the high}} volume of produced pills, an interesting field of application is in the pharmaceutical industry to control the coating of tablets. Fiber-based OCT systems are particularly adaptable to industrial environments. These can access and scan interiors of hard-to-reach spaces, {{and are able to}} operate in hostile environments—whether radioactive, cryogenic, or very hot. Novel optical biomedical diagnostic and imaging technologies are currently being developed to solve problems in biology and medicine.|$|E
25|$|Since the game's release, {{a number}} of {{computer}} games have been published based on Settlers of Catan and its spinoffs. The first sanctioned English-language release was Catan: The Computer Game, developed for the PC by Castle Hill Studios and published by Big Fish Games. This <b>off-line</b> game was available from MSN, as it was acquired by Microsoft who also released Catan Online in August 2005 on MSN Games, the game now requiring an internet connection. In 2005, Capcom edited the first portable version of Settlers of Catan on the N-Gage Nokia handheld device.|$|E
25|$|The first {{graphical}} character-based interactive {{environment is}} Club Caribe. First released as Habitat in 1988, Club Caribe {{was introduced by}} LucasArts for Q-Link customers on their Commodore 64 computers. Users could interact with one another, chat and exchange items. Although the game's open world was very basic, its use of online avatars (already well-established <b>off-line</b> by Ultima and other games) and the combination of chat and graphics was revolutionary. Online graphics in the late 1980s were severely restricted {{by the need to}} support modem data transfer rates as low as 300 bits per second. Habitat's graphics were stored locally on floppy disk, eliminating the need for network transfer.|$|E
25|$|In many localities, paramedics {{operate as}} a direct {{extension}} of a physician medical director and practice {{as an extension of}} the medical director's license. In the United States, a physician delegates authority under an individual state's Medical Practice Act. This gives a paramedic the ability to practice within limited scope of practice in law, along with state DOH guidelines and medical control oversight. The authority to practice in this manner is granted in the form of standing orders (protocols) (<b>off-line</b> medical control) and direct physician consultation via phone or radio (on-line medical control). Under this paradigm, paramedics effectively assume the role of out-of-hospital field agents to regional emergency physicians, with independent clinical decision.|$|E
25|$|Various {{optimizations}} and tweaks to {{the implementation}} of FAT file system drivers, block device drivers and disk tools have been devised to overcome most of the performance bottlenecks in the file system's inherent design without having to change the layout of the on-disk structures. They can be divided into on-line and <b>off-line</b> methods and work by trying to avoid fragmentation in the file system in the first place, deploying methods to better cope with existing fragmentation, and by reordering and optimizing the on-disk structures. With optimizations in place, the performance on FAT volumes can often reach that of more sophisticated file systems in practical scenarios, {{while at the same time}} retaining the advantage of being accessible even on very small or old systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{interface}} between a liquid phase technique (HPLC) with a continuously flowing eluate, and a gas phase technique {{carried out in}} a vacuum was difficult for a long time. The advent of electrospray ionization changed this. Currently, the most common LC-MS interfaces are electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI). These are newer MS ion sources that facilitate {{the transition from a}} high pressure environment (HPLC) to high vacuum conditions needed at the MS analyzer. Although these interfaces are described individually, they can also be commercially available as dual ESI/APCI, ESI/APPI, or APCI/APPI ion sources. Various deposition and drying techniques were used in the past (e.g., moving belts) but the most common of these was the <b>off-line</b> MALDI deposition. A new approach still under development called direct-EI LC-MS interface, couples a nano HPLC system and an electron ionization equipped mass spectrometer.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} systems also made forays into GUI-based interfaces, either using {{character}} graphics sent from the host, or using custom GUI-based terminal systems. The latter initially appeared, unsurprisingly, on the Amiga and Macintosh platform, where TeleFinder and FirstClass became very popular. FirstClass offered {{a host of}} features that would be difficult or impossible under a terminal-based solution, including bi-directional information flow and non-blocking operation that allowed the user to exchange files in both directions while continuing to use the message system and chat, all in separate windows. Skypix featured on Amiga a complete markup language. It used a standardized set of icons to indicate mouse driven commands available online and to recognize different filetypes present on BBS storage media. It was capable to transmit data like images, audio files, and audio clips between users linked to same BBS or <b>off-line</b> if BBS was in the circuit of FidoNet organization.|$|E
25|$|Systems as {{complicated}} as computers require very high reliability. ENIAC remained on, in continuous operation from 1947 to 1955, for eight years before being shut down. Although a vacuum tube might fail, it would be replaced without bringing down the system. By the simple strategy of never shutting down ENIAC, the failures were dramatically reduced. The vacuum-tube SAGE air-defense computers became remarkably reliable – installed in pairs, one <b>off-line,</b> tubes likely to fail did so when the computer was intentionally run at reduced power to find them. Hot-pluggable hard disks, like the hot-pluggable vacuum tubes of yesteryear, continue the tradition of repair during continuous operation. Semiconductor memories routinely have no errors when they operate, although operating systems like Unix have employed memory tests on start-up to detect failing hardware. Today, the requirement of reliable performance is made even more stringent when server farms are the delivery platform. Google has managed this by using fault-tolerant software to recover from hardware failures, and is even working {{on the concept of}} replacing entire server farms on-the-fly, during a service event.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the second}} Algérie Ferries charter, the Fantaasia was {{chartered}} to the Norway-based Kystlink {{for three months}} (with an option for three additional months) from October 2007 onwards to replace their MS Pride of Telemark {{that was out of}} service following an accident when the ship rammed the breakwater at Hirtshals, Denmark. Before entering service for Kystlink, Fantaasia was docked at Cityvarvet, Gothenburg. On 15 November, the Swedish Maritime Authority Sjöfartsinspektionen deemed the ship unsafe and prohibited it from leaving Cityvarvet until 18 faults found during the inspection were fixed. Twelve of the faults were considered severe, including several permanently open watertight doors, a non-functional loudspeaker system, blocked emergency exists and non-functional winches used for lowering lifeboats. According to Tallink, the inspection was made while refitting of the ship was still in process, which they cited as the reason why several onboard systems were turned <b>off-line</b> and normal safety procedures were not observed. On 11 December, the ship entered service with Kystlink on its Langesund–Hirtshals and Langesund–Strömstad routes.|$|E
25|$|The second care structure, {{termed the}} Anglo-American model, {{utilizes}} pre-hospital allied health staff, such as emergency medical technicians and paramedics, to staff ambulances, {{which may be}} classified according to the varying skill levels of the crews. In this model it is rare to find a physician actually working routinely in the pre-hospital setting, although they may be utilised on complex or major injuries or illnesses. In this system, a physicians involvement {{is most likely to}} be the provision of medical oversight for the work of the ambulance crews, which may be accomplished in terms of <b>off-line</b> medical control, with protocols or 'standing orders' for certain types of medical procedures or care, or on-line medical control, in which the technician must establish contact with the physician, usually at the hospital, and receive direct orders for various types of medical interventions. In some cases, such as in the UK, South Africa and Australia, a paramedic may be an autonomous health care professional, and does not require the permission of a physician to administer interventions or medications from an agreed list, and can perform roles such as suturing or prescribing medication to the patient.|$|E
25|$|Paramedics in {{countries}} that follow the Anglo-American model normally function under the authority (medical direction) {{of one or more}} physicians charged with legally establishing the emergency medical directives for a particular region. Paramedics are credentialed and authorized by these physicians to use their own clinical judgment and diagnostic tools to identify medical emergencies and to administer the appropriate treatment, including drugs that would normally require a physician order. Credentialing may occur {{as the result of a}} State Medical Board examination (U.S.) or the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (U.S.). In England, and in some parts of Canada, credentialing may occur by means of a College of Paramedicine. In these cases, paramedics are regarded as a self-regulating health profession. The final common method of credentialing is through certification by a Medical Director and permission to practice as an extension of the Medical Director's license to practice some medical acts. The authority to practice in this semi-autonomous manner is granted in the form of standing order protocols (<b>off-line</b> medical control) and in some cases direct physician consultation via phone or radio (on-line medical control). Under this paradigm, paramedics effectively assume the role of out-of-hospital field agents to regional emergency physicians, with clinical decision-making authority using standing orders or protocols.|$|E
