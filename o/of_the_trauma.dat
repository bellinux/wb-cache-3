5|$|When {{the series}} begins, Allen is about 15 years old. Although {{most of his}} colleagues assume he is ageing normally, one of his enemies (Nea, who later {{possesses}} his body), suspects {{that he may be}} growing younger. Allen is often accompanied by Timcampy, a small flying golem given him by his mentor (Exorcist general Cross Marian). As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trauma</b> of attempting to revive his guardian, Mana Walker, Allen's reddish-brown hair becomes white. Mana's curse of the boy's left eye allows Allen to distinguish Akuma from humans. Allen is devoted to helping the Akuma find peace until he meets the Exorcists of the Black Order, who become his friends. Realizing that he fights to save the souls of the Akuma and for his human friends, he devotes himself equally to both causes. Allen's master, Cross Marian, notes that the boy (originally cynical and rude), has adopted Mana's formal speech, mannerisms and personality. Allen begins to speak less formally during the series, reverting to his speech before he met Mana.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{distinction}} between trauma induced by recent situations and long-term trauma {{which may have been}} buried in the unconscious from past situations such as childhood abuse. Trauma is often overcome through healing; in some cases this can be achieved by recreating or revisiting the origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trauma</b> under more psychologically safe circumstances, such as with a therapist.|$|E
25|$|Triggers and cues act as {{reminders}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trauma,</b> and {{can cause}} anxiety and other associated emotions. Often the person can be completely unaware of what these triggers are. In many cases this may lead a person suffering from traumatic disorders to engage in disruptive or self-destructive coping mechanisms, often without being {{fully aware of the}} nature or causes of their own actions. Panic attacks are an example of a psychosomatic response to such emotional triggers.|$|E

25|$|Generally, the {{approach}} {{is to focus on}} the present problem, rather than the abuse itself. Treatment is highly varied and depends on the person’s specific issues. For instance, a person with a history of sexual abuse suffering from severe depression would be treated for depression. However, there is often an emphasis on cognitive restructuring due to the deep-seated nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trauma.</b> Some newer techniques such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) {{have been shown to be}} effective.|$|E

Methods: Twenty-one consecutive patients with low-energy cervical spinal cord injury were identified from the spinal injuries unit database (eg, ball sports, diving, surfing, and falls). Twenty-one aged-matched patients with high-energy cervical spinal cord injury (eg, motor vehicle trauma) were then randomly selected and the groups were compared. All patients had formal American Spinal Injuries Association assessment on admission and at 6 months. Results: At the 6 -month follow-up, <b>the</b> energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>trauma</b> was not found to influence the neurological outcome (P=. 76). Early definitive intervention (< 8 hours) for patients with incomplete cord lesions was shown to significantly affect outcome (P=. 049).

25|$|Predictor {{models have}} {{consistently}} found that childhood trauma, chronic adversity, and familial stressors increase risk for PTSD {{as well as}} risk for biological markers of risk for PTSD after a traumatic event in adulthood. Experiencing bullying as a child or an adult has been correlated {{with the development of}} PTSD. Peritraumatic dissociation in children is a predictive indicator of the development of PTSD later in life. This effect of childhood trauma, which is not well understood, may be a marker for both traumatic experiences and attachment problems.

The session was suspended with Häkkinen being critically injured due to sustaining a skull fracture, internal bleeding and a blockage of his airway. His life was saved by the efforts of the trackside medical team which included doctors from the Royal Adelaide Hospital, one of whom performed an emergency cricothyroidotomy at the trackside. Häkkinen was immediately transported by ambulance to the nearby Royal Adelaide Hospital which was luckily located only about half a kilometre from the circuit. There he remained in a critical condition under care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trauma</b> Service, the Neurosurgical Unit, and the Intensive Care Unit and remained in the hospital for approximately two months.

25|$|Before {{his death}} {{he had asked}} {{to be buried in}} Saint-Servais and that his skull be placed in the ossuary {{alongside}} the bones of his mother and grandparents which was the practice at the time. This by law could only take place five years after burial and on 8 October 1907, with the permission of the bishops of Quimper and the Léon diocese to open up the tomb and remove the head, the process was started. However the body was still in a good condition and the abbot Guivarc'h had to cut the head off himself. This led to litigation by some members of the Dargent family who accused Ernest and the bishop with violation of the Dargent grave. The trial lasted six months and although on the 26 June the Morlaix tribunal issued a verdict of not guilty, Ernest died four days later from the effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trauma</b> the legal process had involved.

25|$|Supporters {{of hunting}} {{maintain}} that when foxes or other prey (such as coyotes {{in the western}} USA) are hunted, the quarry are either killed relatively quickly (instantly or {{in a matter of}} seconds) or escapes uninjured. Similarly, they say that the animal rarely endures hours of torment and pursuit by hounds, and research by Oxford University shows that the fox is normally killed after an average of 17minutes of chase. They further argue that, while hunting with hounds may cause suffering, controlling fox numbers by other means is even more cruel. Depending on the skill of the shooter, the type of firearm used, the availability of good shooting positions and luck, shooting foxes can cause either an instant kill, or lengthy periods of agony for wounded animals which can die <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trauma</b> within hours, or of secondary infection over a period of days or weeks. Research from wildlife hospitals, however, indicates that {{it is not uncommon for}} foxes with minor shot wounds to survive. Hunt supporters further say that it is a matter of humanity to kill foxes rather than allow them to suffer malnourishment and mange.|$|E

500|$|The writer Jonathan Kellerman's {{introduction}} to the 2006 edition of Diamonds Are Forever describes Bond as a [...] "surprisingly... complex" [...] character who, {{in contrast with the}} cinematic representation, is [...] "nothing other than human.... Fleming's Bond makes mistakes and pays for them. He feels pain and regret." [...] The novelist Raymond Benson—who later wrote a series of Bond novels—writes that the character develops in Diamonds Are Forever, building on Fleming's characterisation in his previous three novels. This growth arises through Bond's burgeoning relationship with the book's main female character, Tiffany Case. He falls in love; the first time he has done so since Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale. According to Benson, Tiffany is portrayed as tough, but lonely and insecure, and [...] "is Fleming's first fully developed female character." [...] The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett write that many of the main female characters in Fleming's novels are uncommon, and Tiffany—along with Pussy Galore from Goldfinger and Honeychile Rider from Dr. No—has been [...] "damaged... sexually" [...] having previously been raped. The effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trauma</b> has led to Tiffany working for the villain, which allows Bond to complete his mission, and align her to a more honest lifestyle.|$|E

500|$|According to Beverley Driver Eddy, The Land of Green Plums {{presents}} trauma {{as well as}} its testimony; {{the narrator}} gives her own testimony, and relates it to the testimony of her friends' suffering. The first of these is Lola, the friend who supposedly kills herself; her testimony is preserved in her diary, in which she wrote of her animalistic sexual exploits with nameless men and her struggle to cope with the guilt of having joined the Communist Party in an effort to better herself. For the narrator, preserving Lola's notebook (and sharing it with her three friends) becomes of paramount importance, especially since the memory of Lola was erased days after her death by the Party establishment. Additional complexity comes from Lola's testimony being interwoven in the narrator's own—"a testimony within a testimony." [...] In an interview published in 1998, Müller said that [...] "she is concerned with showing that the childhood experiences have been internalised by the narrator, and that the traumas of the frightened, non-conformist child are replicated to the larger traumas of the adult dissident." [...] In the image of the weeds cut down by the narrator's father, an image presented early in the novel, the parallel between the father and the dictator is evidenced: [...] "both 'make cemeteries' without fear of retribution." [...] One symptom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trauma</b> this causes in its victims is disconnection, the strain of friendship resulting from lack of trust, disrupting normal human relationships {{for the remainder of the}} victim's life. Müller's novel portrays this disconnection and the ongoing trauma for survivors, even after the fall of the dictatorship.|$|E
