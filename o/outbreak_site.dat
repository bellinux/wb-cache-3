40|$|We have {{recently}} demonstrated the geographic isolation of rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) {{populations in the}} tungro-endemic provinces of Isabela and North Cotabato, Philippines. In this study, we examined the genetic structure of the virus populations at the tungro-outbreak sites of Lanao del Norte, a province adjacent to North Cotabato. We also analyzed the virus populations at the tungro-endemic sites of Subang, Indonesia, and Dien Khanh, Vietnam. Total DNA extracts from 274 isolates were digested with EcoRV restriction enzyme and hybridized with a full-length probe of RTBV. In the total population, 22 EcoRV-restricted genome profiles (genotypes) were identified. Although overlapping genotypes could be observed, the <b>outbreak</b> <b>sites</b> of Lanao del Norte had a genotype combination distinct from that of Subang or Dien Khanh but a genotype combination similar to that identified earlier from North Cotabato, the adjacent endemic province. Sequence analysis of the intergenic region {{and part of the}} ORF 1 RTBV genome from randomly selected genotypes confirms the geographic clustering of RTBV genotypes and, combined with restriction analysis, the results suggest a fragmented spatial distribution of RTBV local populations in the three countries. Because RTBV depends on rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV) for transmission, the population dynamics of both tungro viruses were then examined at the endemic and <b>outbreak</b> <b>sites</b> within the Philippines. The RTBV genotypes and the coat protein RTSV genotypes were used as indicators for virus diversity.

[...] Studies with mosquitoes from the epidemic zone after the outbreak showed that Psorophora ferox and Ochlerotatus scapularis {{could be classified as}} potential vectors, but Ochlerotatus serratus was relatively insusceptible. Field investigations in the late 1970s and 1980s showed that Ochlerotatus scapularis, Ochlerotatus serratus and species of Culex (Melanoconion) were the predominant mosquitoes in the epidemic zone, and that Ochlerotatus scapularis was the most common and abundant mosquito in human settlements and human-made environments. Outside the epidemic zone, laboratory studies have shown that Culex tarsalis mosquitoes from Arizona and Culex pipiens pipiens mosquitoes from Illinois were relatively efficient experimental vectors; Tennessee Culex pipiens subspecies and Argentina Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus were moderately efficient experimental vectors; Louisiana Psorophora ferox, and Culex nigripalpus and Culex (Melanoconion) opisthopus from Florida were relatively inefficient experimental vectors. Psorophora ferox and Aedes scapularis were shown to be susceptible to per os infection with Rocio virus and could transmit the virus by bite following an incubation period, whereas infection rates in Ochlerotatus serratus did not exceed 36% and an ID50 could not be calculated for this species so it is unlikely to be an epidemiologically important vector of Rocio virus.|$|E

"An {{influenza}} A H5 {{virus was}} present in multiple organs in all species from the <b>outbreak</b> <b>site</b> in Grd Jotyar (Table). cDNA for sequencing was amplified directly from RNA extracts from pathologic materials without virus isolation. On the basis of sequence analysis of the full HA1 gene and 219 amino acids of the HA2 gene, the viruses from the goose and 1 cat from Grd Jotyar and from the person who died from Sarcapcarn (sequence derived from PCR amplification from first-passage egg material) are >99% identical at the nucleotide and amino acid levels (GenBank nos. DQ435200-02). Thus, no indication of virus adaptation to cats was found. The viruses from Iraq are most closely related to currently circulating Qinghai-like viruses, but when compared with A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/65/2005 (H5N1) (GenBank no. DQ095622), they share only 97.4% identity at the nucleic acid level with 3 amino acid substitutions of unknown significance. On the other hand, the virus from the cat is only 93.4% identical to A/tiger/Thailand/CU-T4/2004(H5N1) (GenBank no. AY972539). These results are not surprising, given that these strains are representative of different clades (8,9). Sequencing of 1,349 bp of the N gene from cat 1 and the goose (to be submitted to GenBank) show identity at the amino acid level, and that the N genes of viruses infecting the cat and goose are >99% identical to that of A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/65/2005(H5N1).

40|$|Phytophthora ramorum is a {{damaging}} invasive {{plant pathogen}} and was first {{discovered in the}} UK in 2002. Spatial point analyses were applied to the occurrence of this disease in England and Wales {{during the period of}} 2003 - 2006 in order to assess its spatio-temporal spread. Out of the 4301 garden centres and nurseries (GCN) surveyed, there were 164, 105, 123 and 41 sites with P. ramorum in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Spatial analysis of the observed point patterns of GCN outbreaks suggested that these sites were significantly clumped within a radius of ca 60 km in 2003, but not in later years. Further analyses were conducted to determine the relationship of GCN <b>outbreak</b> <b>sites</b> over two consecutive years and thus to infer possible disease spread over time. This analysis suggested that disease spread among GCN sites was most likely to have occurred within a distance of 60 km for 2003 - 2004, but not for the later years. There were 35, 63, 81 and 58 sites with P. ramorum in the semi-natural environment (SNE). Analyses were carried out to assess whether infected GCN sites could act as an inoculum source of infected SNE plants or vice versa. In all years, there was a significant spatial closeness among GCN and SNE <b>outbreak</b> <b>sites</b> within a distance of 1 km. But a significant relationship over a longer distance (within 60 km) was only observed between cases in 2003 and 2004.

Movement patterns of midges were inferred indirectly from patterns of the spread of bluetongue outbreaks between farms (using outbreak data from 1999 - 2001 for Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey) and then matched to concurrent wind patterns. The general methodology was to determine wind trajectories to and from each <b>outbreak</b> <b>site</b> based on the horizontal and vertical wind components of the European ReAnalysis- 40 (ERA- 40) dataset from the European centre for medium-range weather forecast (ECMWF). Forward trajectories (downwind or where the windvectors pointed to) and backward trajectories (upwind or where the wind-vectors originated from) were calculated for each outbreak for the period from one week before to one week after it had been recorded. These wind trajectories were then compared with the general outbreak patterns taking into consideration the different serotypes involved. It {{was found that the}} wind trajectories could be matched to the temporal distribution of the outbreak cases. Furthermore, the spread of the infected vector via the calculated wind trajectories was corroborated by molecular evidence. The conclusion is that the methodology presented is appropriate for quantifying the risk of spread of infected Culicoides midges by wind and that this approach could form an important component of a regional early-warning system for bluetongue...|$|E

From the whole RNA extracted from captured mosquitoes, we developed a new end-point multiplex retro transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), for both the detection and identification of Aedes spp. and ChikV. This RT-PCR protocol is able to detect ChikV directly from adult insects, during alerts or emergencies. The entomological trapping associated with bio-molecular methods represents an effective strategy to detect ChikV directly from vectors. Moreover, after a specific evaluation, this RT-PCR protocol could be applied also for human blood samples in regions with the certain presence of this virus...|$|E
40|$|H 5 N 1) was confi rmed in poultry in 4 of 34 Afghan provinces. A survey {{conducted}} in 2 affected and 3 unaffected provinces found that greater knowledge about reducing exposure {{was associated with}} higher socioeconomic status, residence in affected provinces, and not owning backyard poultry. Avian influenza (H 5 N 1) {{has been reported in}} southern Asia (1). In Afghanistan, avian cases were confirmed from February through April 2007 in 4 of 34 provinces (1). No human cases have been detected, although limited human-to-human transmission has been reported from Pakistan (2). Backyard poultry (chickens) were affected in 20 of 22 <b>outbreak</b> <b>sites</b> in 4 eastern provinces. No outbreaks have been reported from commercial facilities. The response in Afghanistan was to cull all poultry within a 3 -km radius, restrict poultry movement and importation, and conduct intensive influenza-like illness surveillance and information, education, and communication (IEC) campaigns within affected provinces. IEC campaigns included leaflets distributed in affected areas and broadcast media coverage on local television and radio. The campaign was designed to inform the public through messages aimed at reducing exposure to disease, preventing spread in poultry, and encouraging reporting. Additional IEC messages were aired nationally and outbreaks were widely reported by local news media. We conducted a survey of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) regarding avian influenza in Afghanistan. The aim was to assess factors associated with KAPs...|$|R
40|$|Hendra {{virus is}} a {{recently}} emerged bat-borne zoonotic agent with high lethality in horses and humans in Australia. This {{is a rare}} disease and the determinants of bat to horse transmission, including the factors that bring these hosts together at critical times, are poorly understood. In this cross-disciplinary study climatic and vegetation primary productivity variables are compared for the dispersed and heterogenic 1994 – 2010 <b>outbreak</b> <b>sites.</b> The significant occurrence of spillover events within the dry season (p = 0. 013, 95 % CI (0. 57 – 0. 98)) suggests seasonal forcing of transmission across species, or seasonal forcing of virus excretion by the reservoir host. We explore the evidence for both. Preliminary investigations of the spatial determinants of Hendra disease locations are also presented. We find that postal areas in the Australian state of Queensland in which pteropid fruit bat (flying fox) roosts occur are approximately forty times more likely (OR = 40. 5, (95 % CI (5. 16, 317. 52)) to be the location of Hendra spillover events. This appears to be independent of density of horses at these locations. We consider issues of scale of host resource use, land use change and limitations of existing data that challenge analysis and limit further conclusive outcomes. This investigation of {{a broad range of}} potential climatic and environmental influences provides a good base for future investigations. Further understanding of cross-species Hendra virus transmissio...|$|R
40|$|Cholera burden in Africa remains unknown, {{often because}} of weak {{national}} surveillance systems. We analyzed {{data from the}} African Cholera Surveillance Network (www. africhol. org). During June 2011 -December 2013, we conducted enhanced surveillance in seven zones and four <b>outbreak</b> <b>sites</b> in Togo, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Guinea, Uganda, Mozambique and Cote d'Ivoire. All health facilities treating cholera cases were included. Cholera incidences were calculated using culture-confirmed cholera cases and culture-confirmed cholera cases corrected for lack of culture testing usually due to overwhelmed health systems and imperfect test sensitivity. Of 13, 377 reported suspected cases, 34 % occurred in Conakry, Guinea, 47 % in Goma, DRC, and 19 % in the remaining sites. From 0 - 40 % of suspected cases were aged under five years and from 0. 3 - 86 % had rice water stools. Within surveillance zones, 0 - 37 % of suspected cases had confirmed cholera compared to 27 - 38 % during outbreaks. Annual confirmed incidence per 10, 000 population was < 0. 5 in surveillance zones, except Goma where it was 4. 6. Goma and Conakry had corrected incidences of 20. 2 and 5. 8 respectively, while the other zones a median of 0. 3. During outbreaks, corrected incidence varied from 2. 6 to 13. 0. Case fatality ratios ranged from 0 - 10 % (median, 1 %) by country. Across different African epidemiological contexts, substantial variation occurred in cholera incidence, age distribution, clinical presentation, culture confirmation, and testing frequency. These results can help guide preventive activities, including vaccine use...|$|R
