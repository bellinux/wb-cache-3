What {{is the quality of}} any event which may be properly called [...] "miraculous"? What are the degrees of wonderfulness?--what the surpassing degree of it, which changes the wonder into the sign, or may be positively recognized by human intelligence as an interruption, instead of a new operation, of those laws of Nature with which, of late, we have become so exhaustively acquainted? For my own part, I can only say that I am so haunted by doubt of the security of <b>our</b> <b>best</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and by discontent in the range of it, that it seems to me contrary to modesty, whether in a religious or scientific point of view, to regard anything as miraculous. I know so little, and this little I know is so inexplicable, that I dare not say anything is wonderful because it is strange to me, or not wonderful because it is familiar. I have not the slightest idea how I compel my hand to write these words, or my lips to read them: and the question which was the thesis of Mr. Ward's very interesting paper, [...] "Can Experience prove the Uniformity of Nature?"[175] is, in my mind, so assuredly answerable with the negative which the writer appeared to desire, that, precisely on that ground, the performance of any so-called miracle whatever would be morally unimpressive to me. If a second Joshua to-morrow commanded the sun to stand still, and it obeyed him; and he therefore claimed deference as a miracle-worker, I am afraid I should answer, [...] "What! a miracle that the sun stands still?--not at all. I was always expecting it would. The only wonder, to me, was its going on." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{is little}} {{need for an}} {{elaborate}} refutation of a fallacy respecting which the only wonder is that it should impose on any one. Two answers may be given to it. In the first place, M. Comte might be referred to experience, and to the writings of his countryman M. Cardaillac and our own Sir William Hamilton, for proof that the mind can not only be conscious of, but attend to, more than one, and even a considerable number, of impressions at once.[12] It is true that attention is weakened by being divided; and this forms a special difficulty in psychological observation, as psychologists (Sir William Hamilton in particular) have fully recognised; but a difficulty is not an impossibility. Secondly, it might have occurred to M. Comte that a fact may be studied {{through the medium of}} memory, not at the very moment of our perceiving it, but the moment after: and this is really the mode in which <b>our</b> <b>best</b> <b>knowledge</b> of our intellectual acts is generally acquired. We reflect on what we have been doing, when the act is past, but when its impression in the memory is still fresh. Unless in one of these ways, we could not have acquired the knowledge, which nobody denies us to have, of what passes in our minds. M. Comte would scarcely have affirmed that we are not aware of our own intellectual operations. We know of our observings and our reasonings, either at the very time, or by memory the moment after; in either case, by direct knowledge, and not (like things done by us in a state of somnambulism) merely by their results. This simple fact destroys the whole of M. Comte's argument. Whatever we are directly aware of, we can directly observe.|$|E

40|$|Skin lesion is {{a severe}} disease in world-wide extent. Early {{detection}} of melanoma in dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However, the accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging {{due to the}} following reasons, e. g. low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists. International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) is a challenge focusing on the automatic analysis of skin lesion. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address all the three tasks announced in ISIC 2017, i. e. lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and lesion classification (task 3). A deep learning framework consisting of two fully-convolutional residual networks (FCRN) is proposed to simultaneously produce the segmentation result and the coarse classification result. A lesion index calculation unit (LICU) is developed to refine the coarse classification results by calculating the distance heat-map. A straight-forward CNN is proposed for the dermoscopic feature extraction task. To <b>our</b> <b>best</b> <b>knowledges,</b> we {{are not aware of}} any previous work proposed for this task. The proposed deep learning frameworks were evaluated on the ISIC 2017 testing set. Experimental results show the promising accuracies of our frameworks, i. e. 0. 718 for task 1, 0. 833 for task 2 and 0. 823 for task 3 were achieved. Comment: ISIC 201...|$|R
