5|$|In 1968, {{the vast}} Prudhoe Bay Oil Field was {{discovered}} in Alaska's North Slope. Fairbanks became a supply point for exploitation of the oil field and for construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which caused a boom unseen since {{the first years of}} Fairbanks' founding and helped the town recover from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood. Fairbanks became a government center in the late 1960s with the establishment of the Fairbanks North Star Borough, which took Fairbanks as its borough seat. A drop in oil prices during the 1980s caused a recession in the Fairbanks area, but the city gradually recovered as oil prices climbed during the 1990s. Tourism also became an important factor in Fairbanks' economy, and the growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>industry</b> and the city continues even as oil production declines.|$|E

25|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, new {{infrastructure}} projects were begun. These included the Izúcar-Tehuantepec {{section of the}} Panamerican Highway {{and the construction of}} the Miguel Alemán Dam. From the 1980s to the present, there has been much development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>industry</b> in the state. This tourism, as well as the population growth of the capital, prompted the construction of the Oaxaca-Mexico City highway in 1994. Development of tourism has been strongest in the Central Valleys area surrounding the capital, with secondary developments in Huatulco and other locations along the coast. This development was threatened by the violence associated with the 2006 uprising, which severely curtailed the number of incoming tourists for several years.|$|E
25|$|The {{railways}} led {{to another}} expansion in tourism. The Kendal and Windermere Railway {{was the first to}} penetrate the Lake District, reaching Kendal in 1846 and Windermere in 1847. The line to Coniston opened in 1848 (although until 1857 this was only linked to the national network with ferries between Fleetwood and Barrow-in-Furness); the line from Penrith through Keswick to Cockermouth in 1865; and the line to Lakeside at the foot of Windermere in 1869. The railways, built with traditional industry in mind, brought with them a huge {{increase in the number of}} visitors, thus contributing to the growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>industry.</b> Railway services were supplemented by steamer boats on the major lakes of Ullswater, Windermere, Coniston Water, and Derwent Water.|$|E
25|$|While {{the growth}} of tourism has benefited the city of Havana economically, {{there have been several}} {{negative}} side effects. One such side effect is the revival of sex tourism in the city. Sex tourism was a central part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>industry</b> before the Revolution. However, after 1960, prostitution was essentially eradicated on the island due to government initiatives and a significant drop in demand as tourism was minimized. With tourism becoming more prevalent in the 1990s, however, so did the practice of prostitution. The demographic profile of tourists (the overwhelming majority being men between ages 25–60) is a key indicator of the existence of prostitution. Additionally, websites and magazines, such as Playboy, have outlined the opportunities for both heterosexual and homosexual sex tourism. According to Trumbull, many prostitutes engage in the practice out of economic necessity, but they do not work in oppressive conditions and a large number of prostitutes in contemporary Havana see the work as a way to earn a better living than if they were to work in open jobs throughout the city. Therefore, contemporary prostitution is different than the sex tourism of the 1950s in this regard.|$|E
