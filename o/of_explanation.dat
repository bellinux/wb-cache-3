5|$|Many {{theories}} have been advanced in way <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> for {{decline of the}} Roman Empire, and many dates given for its fall, from the onset of its decline in the 3rd century to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Militarily, however, the Empire finally fell after first being overrun by various non-Roman peoples and then having its heart in Italy seized by Germanic troops in a revolt. The historicity and exact dates are uncertain, and some historians do not consider that the Empire fell at this point.|$|E

5|$|The game {{retained}} the mechanics and gameplay of its predecessor but introduced new levels, settings and graphics. Former journalist Stuart Campbell designed the game's levels, making them harder and more tactically demanding, {{as well as}} introducing a multitude of pop culture references in the level titles. The development of the game's plot was hampered by budget constraints and the resulting lack <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> confused reviewers. Critics enjoyed the gameplay retained from the original Cannon Fodder but were disappointed {{at the lack of}} new mechanics or weapons, comparing the game to a data disk. Reviewers praised the game's level design, though less so those of its alien planet. Critics gave Cannon Fodder 2 positive reviews but lower scores than its predecessor and gave mixed criticism of the new theme music and increased difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The {{partners}} published their History of Quadrupeds in 1790, {{intended for}} children but reaching an adult readership, and its success {{encouraged them to}} consider a more serious work of natural history. In preparation for this Bewick spent several years engraving the wood blocks for Land Birds, {{the first volume of}} A History of British Birds. Given his detailed knowledge of the birds of Northumberland, Bewick prepared the illustrations, so Beilby was given the task of assembling the text, which he struggled to do. Bewick ended up writing most of the text, which led to a dispute over authorship; Bewick refused to have Beilby named as the author, and in the end only Bewick's name appeared on the title page, along with a paragraph <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> {{at the end of the}} preface.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the wide}} array of {{phenomena}} that are of interest to them, psychologists offer highly diverse and heterogeneous types <b>of</b> <b>explanations.</b> Initially, {{this suggests that the}} question "What is psychological explanation?" has no single answer. To provide appreciation of this diversity, we begin by noting some of the more common types <b>of</b> <b>explanations</b> that psychologists provide, with particular focus on classical examples <b>of</b> <b>explanations</b> advanced in three different areas of psychology: psychophysics, physiological psychology, and information-processing psychology. To analyze what is involved in these types <b>of</b> <b>explanations,</b> we consider the ways in which law-like representations of regularities and representations of mechanisms factor in psychological explanations. This consideration directs us to certain fundamental questions, e. g., "To what extent are laws necessary for psychological explanations?" and "What do psychologists have in mind when they appeal to mechanisms in explanation?" In answering such questions, it appears that laws do play important roles in psychological explanations, although most explanations in psychology appeal to accounts of mechanisms. Consequently, we provide a unifying account <b>of</b> what psychological <b>explanation</b> is...|$|R
