Meanwhile, word arrives that a battle is taking place with Griffon's army. The leader of the rebels, Elena (Hiroe Oka/Kath Soucie) {{contacts}} Nobb, and Max recognizes her as his mother. She explains she is from Monica's time; the rebels learned Griffon was {{in possession of a}} gold atlamillia and was attempting to find the other two. The first was owned by Monica's father, who Gaspard assassinated, although Monica got the stone. The rebels then located the final stone one hundred and fifteen years in the past, owned by Gerald, Max's father. Elena travelled back in time to protect Gerald.

Max and Monica decide to rewrite Crest's history {{so as to avoid}} his death. They head to the Moon Crystal Lighthouse where he died, and travel into the past where they see Lin and Crest (Susumu Chiba/Scott McAfee) attacked by the warship Death Ark, captained by Gaspard (Takahiro Sakurai/Rino Romano), the man who killed Monica's father. They are unable to prevent Crest's death, but Lin, inspired by Crest's successful attempt to save the lighthouse's moon crystal, vows to become a legendary sage herself. Max and Monica go to the future, where they meet Madam Crest – an elderly Lin - who tells them Griffon comes from 10,000 years in the past. The atlamillia cannot make such a jump, and Lin says the only people capable of doing so are the scientists at the Luna Lab.|$|E

Max and Monica travel to Heim Rada to begin restoring the <b>origin</b> <b>point</b> of the Gundorada Workshop. As they go about rebuilding the village, they are again attacked by the Death Ark. They confront Gaspard and he tells them he is just like them; fighting for a parent. He explains that his changeling father died when he was a child, and he and his mother (Rikako Aikawa/Samantha Newark) were run out of town. Eventually, she died, but beforehand, she told him he must find something worth protecting. Gaspard realizes he hasn't found such a thing, and now lives only for hatred. He tells them they must defeat Griffon, and asks if he can join them. However, the magic of Griffon turns him into a dragon and forces him to fight them. They reluctantly kill him. However, a child Gaspard is then shown meeting his mother in their old house, where she tells him she is proud that he found something worth protecting.|$|E
25|$|From around 1950 to 1965, {{the support}} for these {{theories}} was evenly divided, with a slight imbalance arising {{from the fact that}} the Big Bang theory could explain both the formation and the observed abundances of hydrogen and helium, whereas the Steady State could explain how they were formed, but not why they should have the observed abundances. However, the observational evidence began to support the idea that the universe evolved from a hot dense state. Objects such as quasars and radio galaxies were observed to be much more common at large distances (therefore in the distant past) than in the nearby universe, whereas the Steady State predicted that the average properties of the universe should be unchanging with time. In addition, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 was considered the death knell of the Steady State, although this prediction was only qualitative, and failed to predict the exact temperature of the CMB. (The key big bang prediction is the black-body spectrum of the CMB, which was not measured with high accuracy until COBE in 1990). After some reformulation, the Big Bang has been regarded as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the cosmos. Before the late 1960s, many cosmologists thought the infinitely dense and physically paradoxical singularity at the starting time of Friedmann's cosmological model could be avoided by allowing for a universe which was contracting before entering the hot dense state, and starting to expand again. This was formalized as Richard Tolman's oscillating universe. In the sixties, Stephen Hawking and others demonstrated that this idea was unworkable, and the singularity is an essential feature of the physics described by Einstein's gravity. This led the majority of cosmologists to accept the notion that the universe as currently described by the physics of general relativity has a finite age. However, due to a lack of a theory of quantum gravity, there is no way to say whether the singularity is an actual <b>origin</b> <b>point</b> for the universe, or whether the physical processes that govern the regime cause the universe to be effectively eternal in character.|$|E
