Following detection, Portuguese authorities initiated the implementation of eradication measures during 1999 and 2000, following an alert provided to European Community officials; as a result, the nematode was confirmed to be confined in the Setúbal region, near Lisbon. A task force from the follow-up group (GANP) created by the Secretary of State for the Rural Development established a national eradication programme (PROLUNP) to (1) Contain PWN within the initial geographic limits; (2) Implement eradication measures; and (3) Monitor PWN at a national level.

On the other hand, identification of causative agents of malnutrition and prevention and control of disease is very crucial. This study was done for evaluation of risk factors in malnourished children under 5 years old in Zahedan. For this purpose, 1050 children attending to health centers of Zahedan who had malnutrition selected randomly in a descriptive cross sectional study and a questionnaire with demographic characteristics of mothers and children completed by interviewing. Then, collected data was analyzed by SPSS software and descriptive statistics. Results of the study showed that malnutrition in girls was more prevalent than boys (60. 1 % and 39. 9 % respectively). Also it was cleared that malnutrition in 6 – 24 months children was more prevalent than other age groups. In majority of cases interval of consecutive pregnancies was less than 24 month(35. 2 %) and number of family members was more than 5 persons (47 %). In 54. 3 % of children the age of beginning food supplement was after 6 month. Most of the parents were uneducated (38. 5 % fathers and 52. 0 % mothers). Although 97. 1 % of mothers were house-wives but 51. 9 % of them were house-wives and uneducated.

40|$|Power {{electronics}} {{are becoming}} established in ever broadening areas of industry. The transition from previous generation technology {{is driven by}} the <b>oportunity</b> <b>for</b> improvements in controllability, efficiency, and longevity. A wide variety of power semiconductors are available, however power handling capacity is still a significant limitation for many applications. An increase in the capacity of a single device is usually accompanied by a drop in switching frequency, and hence achievable system bandwidth. Increased capacity can be attained without this loss in bandwidth by using multiple lower power devices in parallel. Products based on parallel device topologies are already present in the marketplace, however there are many associated complications. The nature of these complications depends on the control method and topology used, but no system combines high performance and high power with high reliability and easy maintainability. This research aims to identify and develop a method that would provide a system of voltage source inverters with a total capacity in excess of 10 MVA, with effective control bandwidth comparable to a 100 kVA system. Additionally, the method should be equally applicable at still higher power levels in the future with the anticipated development of higher capacity power semiconductors. The primary goal when using paralleled devices is to achieve an even distribution of system load between them, as unbalanced load leads to poor system utilisation. Devices can be paralleled either passively, in which devices are controlled in common and characteristics inherent to the device are relied upon to balance load; or actively, in which devices are individually controlled and monitored to improve load balance. A key component of the thesis is the identification and analysis of the inadequacies inherent to passively paralleled systems. It is the limitations of passive paralleling that provide the motivation to develop an active parallel control mechanism. Following the analysis, an active control algorithm is developed and implemented on a paralleled system. The proposed system topology consists of an array of medium power Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) modules operating in parallel. Each module is controlled semi-independently at a local level, with an inter-module communications network to enable active equalisation of module load, and redundant fault management. An innovative load equalisatiion algorithm is developed and proven, the key feature of which is this inclusion of a synthetic differential resistance between modules within the system. The result is a modular expandable structure offering the potential for very high power capacity combined with quality of response usually only found in low power systems. The system as a whole is extremely reliable as any module can be isolated {{in the event of a}} fault without significantly affecting the remainder of the network. Performance results from both simulation and experimentation on a two module small scale prototype are given. Using the developed topology and control method extremely accurate load balancing can be achieved without degradation of the response characteristics. The system is tested up to only 2. 4 kW in the course of this research, but the correlation with simulation is high and gives confidence that the developed mechanism will allow the 10 MV A goal to be achieved. Following the developmental stage of this research the technology has been applied to a commercial system comprising parallel structures of up to 8 modules with a total power handling capacity of 1 MVA with no deterioration in performance. 2 MVA systems are deliverable with the current technology without any changes, and higher power levels are expected to be easily achieved...|$|E

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the effectiveness of}} employment agencies system operating in the Lodz Administrative Province in the years 1990 - 1993. We interpret this system {{as a set of}} activities and measures used by local employment agencies to find jobs for persons seeking them and appropriate employees for enterprises. The system in question is perceived very broadly by us, as it includes activities allowing the unemployed to use directly the offer of available jobs, as well as indirect measures creating an opportunity of finding temporary jobs (intervention and public works, additional places of work) or create a chance for finding a job through training and financial assistance (loans). Our survey was focussed on he effectiveness of indirect measures. It shows that the most effective measures were intervention works and training programmes, as they offered the best opportunities for the unemployed and, moreover, their cost was lower than costs of the remaining forms of assistance. They also created the biggest <b>oportunities</b> <b>for</b> the so-called permanent reactivation of jobless persons. During the analyzed period, we observed a growing activeness of employment agencies on local labour markets. This process means that more and more jobless persons could get jobs owing to the activity of employment agencies. It is our opinion, however, that the effectiveness of employment agencies in the Lodz Province was low, which was due to poor performance of local economic units, financial, personnel and technical problems of employment agencies. Without trying to undermine, to any extent, the importance of above mentioned forms of counteracting unemployment, it should be said that they can play only an auxiliary and supplementary role in eliminating this phenomenon, while the main role will be played by the economic growth strategy for the whole country and for this administrative province.
