5|$|At {{the end of}} Woolley's directorship, the 74-inch {{telescope}} he had initiated {{finally came}} online.

With a new design of photometer, he was able to measure the exceptionally faint stars in these clusters. Gascoigne determined that the clusters in the Magellanic Clouds were both young and <b>old,</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> quite different characteristics to those in the Milky Way: this information was important for modelling the evolution of galaxies.|$|E

Additionally, maintenance crews had noted recurring issues with the aircraft's autopilot, including the altitude hold function.|$|E
