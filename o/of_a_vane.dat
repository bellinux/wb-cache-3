50|$|The {{key element}} of a vacuum filler is the vacuum filling principle. The filling product is fed into the feed system {{mechanically}} via a hopper with actively driven feeding auger, as well as via vertical “vacuum suction”. Pre-evacuated cells <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vane</b> cell feed system move underneath the hopper. The pressure difference relative to the ambient pressure (underpressure) caused by the evacuation ensures that the cells are filled with product. The feed system moves continuously, thus generating a continuous filling flow. The product is portioned by means of cyclic movements of the feed system. Each cell of the feed system has a particular volume. The portion {{is defined by the}} rotation distance of the rotor. The portioning volume is therefore set in the control system by multiplying the rotor’s rotation distance by the number of the feed system cells within it. The portion weight must be determined in the control system via the portion volume parameter with the aid of scales.|$|E
50|$|A {{second problem}} with the {{conventional}} carburettor was its good performance in steady conditions, but poor progression: its dynamic ability to respond, such as when suddenly opening the throttle. This could give 'flat spots' in performance, or required great additional complexity to the carburettor such as multiple chokes, emulsion tubes and accelerator pumps. The Fish carburettor metered its fuel flow through a calibrated tapered groove, connected directly to the accelerator pedal and the throttle butterfly. The fuel metering orifice was controlled in immediate proportion to the throttle position, {{in a similar manner}} to the motorcycle slide carburettor. Between the float chamber and the venturi, an additional chamber, unique to the Fish design, contains the metering arm and groove. The arm is attached to the throttle spindle, moves with it, and is drilled with a hollow channel supplying fuel to the jets on the throttle spindle. This arm has an inlet hole at its end, which is a simple drilling and not of precise size. The hole passes over the metering groove, which is a radial arc in one wall of the chamber and it is the width of this groove which is precisely controlled, so as to accurately meter the fuel. As the throttle arm moves to the wide-throttle position, the arm sweeps across to the wider part of the groove, allowing more fuel to flow. The arm is close-fitting within the width of the chamber. As it moves, this close fit has the effect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vane</b> pump and acts as an accelerator pump to force additional fuel into the jet when the throttle is first opened.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to show how recording the changes in the rotation torque according to the rotation speed can lead to identifying a characteristic flow curve for the tested concrete. The concrete rheometer used for the study is composed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vane</b> tool. The rotation speed of the tool is imposed and the resulting torques are measured. The experimental rotation protocol used in this study corresponds to a rapid speed increase followed by a steady speed then the rotation speed slows down. The evolution of the torque measured as the rotation speed decrease (restructuring phase) is considered as being a succession of stationary states. By considering the fluid equivalent to a Bingham fluid for which the yield stress has already been identified and by using an analogy with a coaxial-cylinders rheometer, relevant relationships between the rotation speed of the vane and the rate of shearing along the tool are identified. Shear stress and shear rate calculations for each value of torque and rotation speed lead to the complete flow curve of the tested fluid. The data treatment method is adjusted to accurately evaluate the parameter linked to the flow stop {{in the case of a}} non-nil shear rate when the yield stress is reached. The comparison of the characteristic rheological parameters of SCC obtained from the rheometer and both spreading and V-Funnel tests indicate very satisfactory correlations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} reducing friction torque in a hydraulic vane pump through a short-period pump operation by using physical vapour deposition (PVD) -coated vanes. It {{is well known that}} the friction torque in a vane pump as well as in other hydraulic machines can be reduced by running-in through a long-time pump operation. This paper revealed that the reduction in the friction torque was derived from lowered friction between a cam contour and vane tips owing to the smoothed surface of a cam contour. Commonly, it was difficult to obtain such an effect through a short-period pump operation. The author has attempted to lessen the surface roughness of the cam contour and to decrease the friction torque <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vane</b> {{in a short period of}} time by using vanes coated with an extremely hard PVD layer on their tips. In this study, three kinds of coatings of chromium nitride (CrN), titanium carbonitride (TiCN), and diamond-like carbon (DLC) by PVD were examined. It was found that the TiCN-coated vane was excellent in smoothing the surface roughness of the cam contour and in reducing the friction torque of the vane in a short period of time. It was also shown that the reduced friction torque of the vane depended essentially on the smoothness of the cam contour surface. In addition, the difference of the friction at the vane tip between an ordinary vane and coated vanes was indistinct for the same surface roughness of the cam contour below 0. 8 μm Rz...|$|E

To meet this objective, YAG:Dy was selected based on the desirable luminescence performance observed for YAG:Dy powder: (1) excellent temperature sensitivity and intensity at operating turbine engine temperatures, (2) an emission peak at the relatively short wavelength of 456 nm, where the interference from background blackbody radiation is fairly low, and (3) its nearly single exponential decay which makes for a simple, reliable temperature calibration. However, implementation of YAG:Dy for surface temperature measurements required application of YAG:Dy as a coating {{onto the surface of}} a superalloy component with a preexisting yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thermal barrier coating (TBC). An inherent dilemma in producing a YAG:Dy coating is that coating processing is constrained to be performed at temperatures below (less than 1200 C) what is considered safe for the superalloy component, much lower than temperatures used to produce the high quality crystalline powder. Therefore, YAG:Dy coatings tend to exhibit lower luminescence performance compared to well prepared YAG:Dy powder, and the luminescence performance of the coating will depend on the method of coating deposition. In this presentation, the luminescence performance of YAG:Dy coatings prepared by the different methods of (1) application of a binder-based YAG:Dy-containing paint, (2) solution precursor plasma spray (SPPS), and (3) electron-beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) and the effect of post-deposition heat treatments will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA large {{variety of}} biotic and abiotic {{processes}} take place {{close to the}} sediment-water interface, causing and being affected byphysical, biological and chemical gradients below and above this transition zone. Adequate sampling of this environment isessential for a comprehensive understanding of the complex sea floor ecological systems. The multi-horizon bottom watersampler (BoWaSnapper) presented here was developed for instantaneous sampling of the transition zone above the seafloor andcan be deployed in all types of water bodies from coastal seas to full ocean depth (6000 m). The intention was to construct aninstrument that could {{bridge the gap between}} the sampling of the bottom water column by conventional CTD rosette andsediment sampling gear such as a multiple corer. The BoWaSnapper was designed to be operated on any research ship?s wire and allows time-efficient high-resolutionsampling of bottom water. The bottommost 2 m are sampled with six vertically adjustable bottles. Prior to closure, the bottlesare aligned with the bottom current by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vane</b> and flushed by bottom water for several minutes. This ensures thatparticles dispersed upon the touch-down of the BoWaSnapper are flushed away. An electronic mechanism, activated by abottom switch, initiates bottle closure after a delay pre-selected by the user. As illustrated by several examples, the transparentbottles (6 L volume each) allow the determination of particle concentrations as well as the analysis of solutes such as nutrients,dissolved gases, and natural radiotracers. Although the sampler is universally suitable for seafloor environments, its specialdomain is characterised by steep geochemical gradients such as cold vents and submarine groundwater discharge.

40|$|Classical design {{optimization}} procedures {{rely on the}} application of optimization algorithms upon system simulations. These algorithms need {{a large number of}} samples to converge on the optimal point. Hence {{design optimization}} needs large simulation time since each simulation has to be performed many times. In this paper an original and useful methodology to study and optimize mechanical systems is presented. The proposed methodology combines different techniques such as design of experiments, response surface models and evolutionary algorithms leading to larger time reduction with respect to the classical design optimization approach. On the one hand the proposed methodology gives the optimal combination of variables {{and on the other hand}} provides important results to understand the influence of each input to the system outputs. Moreover, a robust design process has been carried out in order to consider the manufacturing tolerances of the real mechanical system and assess their effect on the system performance. The results offer important information and design insights that would be very difficult to obtain without such a procedure. In order to demonstrate the methodology effectiveness, two case studies have been accounted: the optimization of the vibration level <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vane</b> pump and a gear pump. To simulate the dynamical behaviour of the two pumps, mathematical models have been used. These models have been developed and validated by the authors in previous works.

The experiments were carried out at USC in two vacuum chambers up to a maximum pressure of 6 Pa for various gases. The computations were performed with both the DSMC and ES-BGK methods for a 2 -D gas over a comparable range of pressures. It is shown that the radiometric devices provide maximum force at a Knudsen number approximating 0. 1. Of the various gases tested, helium provides the largest peak force. Qualitatively, the experimental data and computational results are similar. A lack of experimental data on gas-surface accommodation and three-dimensionality yields up to a 40 % difference in {{the magnitude of the}} measured and computed forces, but it is shown that this discrepancy can be used to predict accommodation values. Comparison of four geometric configurations has shown that the effect of the area is signficant at pressures up to where the force is maximum. It is also demonstrated that the size of the chamber in which the radiometer resides is of primary importance, where the chamber dimensions are inversely related to the generated force. Finally, simulation of multi-vane configurations have shown that the optimal spacing of vanes can be tailored for specfic uses; for maximum force production a tight spacing should be used, while maximum efficiency requires spacing on the order <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vane</b> dimension.

40|$|Vane {{pumps are}} simple in {{principle}} {{and can be}} mass produced inexpensively, making them well suited to the automotive industry. They also have many other applications, {{such as in the}} chemical industry and food industry. A common type of damage to a vane pump is cavitation erosion on the side plates. If this damage is not detected in time, it could cause failure of the pump, which {{depending on the type of}} system may have safety implications, and in some cases a high cost from lost production whilst the system is shut down. This kind of damage is common on other types of pumps such as gear pumps and piston pumps. So a practical method for fault diagnosis of hydraulic pumps is required which does not necessitate removal of a pump from the working system. This paper presents a method of detecting and identifying cavitation damage on pump side plates via pump flow ripple. Power steering vane pumps are used for this study, although the principles may also be applicable to other types of vane pump, and indeed to piston and gear pumps. The investigation has been done through measurement and simulation. A numerical model <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vane</b> pump is described, and simulated cavitation damage is introduced into the model. This damage is shown to have a clear effect on the simulated flow ripple. The pump flow ripple has also been measured experimentally using the Secondary Source Method, and artificial damage has been introduced into the pump. The damage is shown to have a clear effect on the measured flow ripple, consistent with the simulation results. Whilst the secondary source enables the measurement of flow ripple in laboratory conditions, it is generally impracticable for in-situ measurement for condition monitoring. A simplified method for calculation of pump flow ripple from in-situ pump pressure ripple measurements and system impedance is discussed...|$|E
