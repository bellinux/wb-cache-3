5|$|A young star such as Epsilon Eridani {{can produce}} {{large amounts of}} {{ultraviolet}} radiation that may be harmful to life. The orbital radius where the UV flux matches that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> Earth lies at just under 0.5AU. Epsilon Eridani's proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets have made it a destination for interstellar travel in science fiction stories.|$|E

5|$|Essai is {{considered}} the first complete treatise on economics, with numerous contributions to the science.

5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> Earth, {{reactive}} elements, such as {{iron and}} uranium, existed in a reduced form that would react with any free oxygen produced by photosynthesising organisms.

With Kubisch manning the movable machine gun, Lent negotiated the capitulation with the Norwegian ground forces and the airfield was in German hands.|$|E
5|$|Sang Pencerah, {{produced}} {{to coincide}} with Muhammadiyah's centenary, was announced in November 2009. It {{was meant to be}} historically accurate, with much of the Rp. 12 billion (US$ 1.3 million) budget paying for period costumes and sets. However, as documentation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> years of Dahlan's life is lacking, those scenes were fictionalised. Sang Pencerah marks the feature film debut of Ihsan Tarore and Giring Ganesha.|$|E

5|$|The first {{assemblies}} of the Republic {{emerged during}} the Kingdom, with their use to ratify regal elections and the repurposing of the comitia centuriata to elect the first consuls.

5|$|A unique {{window on}} the Universe enabled by Hubble are the Hubble Deep Field, Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, and Hubble Extreme Deep Field images, which used Hubble's {{unmatched}} sensitivity at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky that are the deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths. The images reveal galaxies billions of light years away, and have generated a wealth of scientific papers, providing a new window <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> Universe. The Wide Field Camera 3 improved the view of these fields in the infrared and ultraviolet, supporting the discovery {{of some of the}} most distant objects yet discovered, such as MACS0647-JD.|$|E
5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> flags {{was not meant}} to depict the timber {{rattlesnake}} as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that the citizens of the Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This response would be much like that of a timber rattlesnake, which is peaceable and slow to anger, but will attack aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.|$|E

5|$|As civil servant, Spruyt made {{an impact}} on the nascent state {{apparatus}} of the Orange Free State. He designed the coat of arms of the state, and laid the foundation of the model state the Orange Free State was to become in later years. Having worked in secretarial functions for the State President himself (as clerk), but also as a servant of parliament, the government, and the State, Spruyt left a clear mark <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> administration and its organisation. Spruyt was also sensitive to good labour relations within the state apparatus, and propagated a rise in the officials' salaries. In this he did not succeed, however, and eventually the matter of the salaries instigated his own resignation. Spruyt felt that his salary was insufficient to live on with a family, and tendered his resignation.|$|E
5|$|Deshasthas {{produced}} prominent literary {{figures in}} Maharashtra between the 13th and the 19th centuries. The great Sanskrit scholar Bhavabhuti was a Deshastha Brahmin who lived around 700 AD in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. His works of high Sanskrit poetry and plays are only equalled {{by those of}} Kalidasa. Two of his best known plays are Mahāvīracarita and Mālatī Mādhava. Mahaviracarita is a work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> life of the Hindu god Rama, whereas Malati Madhava is a love story between Malati and her lover Madhava, which has a happy ending after several twists and turns.|$|E
