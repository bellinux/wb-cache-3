40|$|Quality of boxed {{cod and haddock}} was {{compared}} with that of penned fish in terms of <b>organoleptic</b> <b>grading,</b> trimethylamine values, Intelectron Fish Tester readings and fish and fillet yield. Boxed fish showed a higher percentage of grade one fish than penned fish. TMA values, however, did not differ greatly. There was less physical damage due to squeezing with boxed fish and consequently a greater yield of landed round fish and fillets...|$|E
40|$|Rad obuhvaća ispitivanje utjecaja polivalentne kulture sa Streptococcus lactis Ak- 60, Micrococcus M- 104, te standardne kulture na zrenje sira trapista u plastičnim folijama. Ispitivanje je pokazalo da je broj bakterija mliječne kiseline štapićastog oblika i broj mikrokoka veći u sirevima sa polivalentnom nego sa standardnom kulturom. Međutim, broj streptokoka je veći u sirevima sa standardnom kulturom. Pokazalo se da je ubrzano zrenje sireva sa polivalentnom kulturom. Provedeno je organoleptičko ocjenjivanje, te su sirevi sa polivalentnori kulturom dobili više ocjene nego oni sa standardnom. The {{effect of}} {{polyvalent}} cultures composed from Streptococcus lactis Ak- 60 und Micrococcus M- 104 on trappist cheese ripening process is investigated and results are {{compared with the}} effect of standard cultures. The cheese is vacuum packed in plastic foils. The {{results of this study}} show that, during the investigated ripening period, the number of lactobacilli and micrococci in cheese with polyvalent cultures is considerably higher than with standard cultures; on the other hand the number of streptococci in cheeses with standard cultures Is higher. The content of soluble nitrogen with polyvalent cultures without foil after 13 days of ripening, is higher than in the samples with standard cultures (0. 207 : 0. 173). The same conclusion can be drawn analysing the 2 samples of cheeses packed in foil, after 20 days of ripening (0. 388 : 0. 313). What about <b>organoleptic</b> <b>grades,</b> the cheeses with polyvalent cultures in plastic foils got 18. 3 points; without foil 18. 0 points; with standard cultures in foils 14. 7 points and without foil 12. 5 points. Polyvalent cultures Str. lactis Ak- 60 and Micrococcus M- 104 can be successful used for the cheese ripening in plastic foil. The ripening period is shorter and the organoleptic properties better compared to the samples obtained with standard cultures...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological data on {{halitosis}} are rare. In {{this study}} we evaluated the prevalence of halitosis in {{the population of the}} city of Bern, Switzerland, using a standardized questionnaire and clinical examination. First of all, a standardized questionnaire was filled out by all 419 participants. In the clinical examination, 'objective' values for halitosis were gathered through two different organoleptic assessments and by the measurement of volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). Additionally, tongue coating and the modified periodontal screening index (PSI) were evaluated for each participant. The questionnaire revealed that 32 % of all subjects sometimes or often experienced halitosis. The <b>organoleptic</b> evaluation (<b>grade</b> 0 - 5) identified 48 persons with grade 3 and higher. Measurement of VSC identified 117 subjects (28 %) with readings of >or= 75 parts per billion (ppb). Tongue coating, modified PSI, and smoking were significantly associated with higher organoleptic scores, and tongue coating and smoking were associated with higher VSC values. For about one-third of the Bernese city population, halitosis seems to pose an oral health problem. Only a weak correlation between self-reported halitosis and either organoleptic or VSC measurements could be detected...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Sound {{epidemiologic}} data on halitosis are rare. We {{evaluated the}} prevalence of halitosis in a young male adult population in Switzerland using a standardized questionnaire and clinical examination. METHODS: Six hundred twenty-six Swiss Army recruits aged 18 to 25 years (mean: 20. 3 years) were selected as study subjects. First, a standardized questionnaire focusing on dental hygiene, self-reported halitosis, smoking, and alcohol consumption was filled out by all participants. In the clinical examination, objective values {{for the presence of}} halitosis were gathered through an organoleptic assessment of the breath odor and the measurement of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). Additionally, tongue coating, plaque index, and probing depths were evaluated for each recruit. RESULTS: The questionnaire revealed that only 17 % of all included recruits had never experienced halitosis. The <b>organoleptic</b> evaluation (<b>grades</b> 0 to 3) identified eight persons with grade 3, 148 persons with grade 2, and 424 persons with grade 1 or 0. The calculation of the Pearson correlation coefficient to evaluate the relationship among the three methods of assessing halitosis revealed little to no correlation. The organoleptic score showed high reproducibility (kappa = 0. 79). Tongue coating was the only influencing factor found to contribute to higher organoleptic scores and higher VSC values. CONCLUSIONS: Oral malodor seemed to pose an oral health problem for about one-fifth of 20 -year-old Swiss males questioned. No correlation between self-reported halitosis and organoleptic or VSC measurements could be detected. Although the organoleptic method described here offers a high reproducibility, the lack of correlation between VSC values and organoleptic scores has to be critically addressed. For further studies assessing new organoleptic scores, a validated index should always be included as a direct control...|$|R
