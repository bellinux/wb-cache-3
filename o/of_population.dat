In this time period, the county's population has increased by 50.69%, or 7,792 people.

5|$|Demographers or sociologists <b>of</b> <b>population</b> {{study the}} size, {{composition}} and {{change over time}} of a given population. Demographers study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study <b>of</b> <b>population</b> is also closely related to human ecology and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology. Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as Mobilities studies and {{is closely related to}} human geography. Demographers may also study spread of disease within a given population or epidemiology.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{investigates the}} use of partial {{functions}} in genetic programming. Previous work {{has shown that the}} convergent behaviour <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> partial functions is very similar to that <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> total functions. However the convergence rates <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> partial functions have been slower. The results presented here demonstrate a significant improvement in the rate <b>of</b> convergence <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> partial functions, and indicate that partial functions represent a realistic alternative to total functions for a range of problems...|$|R
