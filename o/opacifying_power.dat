40|$|Novel, {{tailored}} {{titanium dioxide}} pigments with controllable nanoscale morphological features {{were shown to}} significantly enhance the optical and strength properties of paper. The <b>opacifying</b> <b>power</b> of synthesized polycrystalline TiO 2 particles in a cellulose matrix was found experimentally to be superior {{to that of a}} commercial rutile pigment, depending on the crystal structure of the synthesized particles. High aspect ratio polycrystalline rutile pigments composed of a linear linkage of several individual rutile crystals gave 6 % more opacity than the commercial rutile pigment. Theoretical light scattering calculations using the T-Matrix Method showed the light scattering efficiency of linearly arranged polycrystalline rutile particles to depend on number and size of crystals composing the particle and confirmed the higher efficiency of the synthesized polycrystalline rutile pigments over commercial rutile. The <b>opacifying</b> <b>power</b> of hollow polycrystalline rutile particles was found experimentally to be superior to that of a commercial rutile pigment in a highly pressed bleached fiber matrix, depending on cavity size, while the <b>opacifying</b> <b>power</b> of silica-rutile titania core-shell particles was found comparable to commercial rutile at constant titania loading. The light scattering efficiency of titania core-shell particles was shown to be dependant on the light scattering efficiency of the core material. The overall particle shape and aspect ratio of titania core-shell and hollow nanoparticles were shown to be tunable by choosing an appropriate template and coating thickness in layer-by-layer or sol-gel templating synthesis. Inorganic-cellulose core-shell and hollow cellulose nanoparticles were prepared by self-encapsulation with regenerated cellulose via precipitation of cellulose in a polyacrylic acid hydrogel layer surrounding inorganic particle templates in 4 -Methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMMO) monohydrate solution. This discrete encapsulation of inorganic pigments with a thin, uniform cellulose shell was found to increase the bondability improvement between the particles and a polysaccharide substrate. The crystallinity of several carbohydrate polymers was shown to significantly affect the bondability of encapsulated core-shell particles. Ph. D.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the synthesis {{and application of}} anisotropic hollow silica colloids as air voided opacity modifiers in dry polymer films in Chapter 1, {{with the aim of}} improving upon the light scattering efficacy of the commercially used isotropic hollow latex particles, ROPAQUE™. In order to generate anisotropic hollow silica particles we utilized a sacrificial templating method, ultimately leading us to {{investigate the}} <b>opacifying</b> <b>power</b> of hollow silica particles derived from a calcium carbonate template known as SOCAL P 3. Initial investigations indicated that shell fragmentation and collapse of our “ 1 st generation” hollow silica particles (with thin shells) led to a loss of opacity, as few air voids remained intact. Tuning the reaction parameters afforded hollow silica particles with thicker shells that displayed enhanced light scattering over the 1 st generation hollow SiO 2 particles and to SOCAL P 3 when film thickness was accounted for. Chapter 2 is an extension of the work done in Chapter 1, wherein we aim to improve pigment dispersion (and consequently opacity) by grafting negatively charged, hydrophilic, polymer brushes to CaCO 3 @SiO 2 particles. This confers enhanced colloidal stability to the particles through electrosteric stabilization. For this we first functionalize the surface with a tertiary alkyl bromide atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) initiator to furnish a surface capable of growing polymer brushes from. The initiator is anchored to the surface through siloxane bonds and an amide group, the latter to enhance hydrolytic stability over a wide pH range. We then used a SI-ATRP (where SI = surface initiated) in order to grow the polymer brushes, which we found to generate highly colloidally stable hollow SiO 2 particles that demonstrate an enhanced contrast ratio to the sterically stabilized hollow SiO 2 -PVP particles used in Chapter 1. In Chapter 3 we investigate the multiple orientations of hematite superellipsoids (pseudocubes stabilized with PVP) trapped at an oil-water interface, through a combination of experiments and simulations. We find three orientations in all; two of which are thermodynamic minima and one which corresponds to a kinetically-trapped orientation. The latter results from some particles going through a negligible free energy gradient upon reorientation. Experimental and computational results for the relative balance of particle populations are found to be in excellent agreement with one another. We show that the final position of the particle is both a function of the free energy landscape and the precise orientation of the particle at the point of contact with the interface. A modified silica rod synthesis from an oil-in-water emulsion is demonstrated in Chapter 4, whereby we manage to asymmetrically include a manganese oxide head {{at one end of the}} rod to generate a colloidal “matchstick” morphology. Placing these particles into a solution of hydrogen peroxide as fuel facilitates their propulsion as they form an asymmetrical gradient of the breakdown products of hydrogen peroxide; water and oxygen. Adjusting fuel concentration alters the effective diffusion coefficient with a 1 st order relationship. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these particles can undergo chemotaxis towards a higher concentration of fuel when placed into a fuel gradient. We rule out convection and other external forces as the reason for directional motion by simultaneously imaging catalytically inert microspheres which travel under convection in the opposite direction to that of the rods...|$|E
