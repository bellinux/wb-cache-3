2500|$|Early in 2004, {{lead singer}} James Hetfield {{revealed}} that Metallica {{had been playing}} new material during studio sessions, but {{that there was no}} mention of plans for a ninth studio album at that time. Select music from the jam sessions may be used on the album, as Lars Ulrich stated, [...] "I definitely look forward to sifting through some of that stuff when we get back to the studio in January." [...] <b>On</b> <b>that</b> <b>note,</b> by October 2004, the band had already compiled nearly 50 hours of pre-set jamming, with hundreds of riffs, chord progressions and bass lines. On September 30, 2004, Launch Radio revealed from an interview with Hetfield that the band hoped to return to the studio in spring of 2005 to begin recording their ninth studio album for Warner Bros. Records.|$|E
2500|$|Critic Luis Leal attests that Carpentier was an {{originating}} {{pillar of}} the magical realist style by implicitly referring to the latter's critical works, writing that [...] "The existence of the marvelous real is what started magical realist literature, which some critics claim is the truly American literature". It can consequently be drawn that Carpentier's [...] "lo real maravilloso" [...] is especially distinct from magical realism {{by the fact that}} the former applies specifically to America. <b>On</b> <b>that</b> <b>note,</b> Lee A. Daniel categorizes critics of Carpentier into three groups: those that do not consider him a magical realist whatsoever (Ángel Flores), those that call him [...] "a mágicorealista writer with no mention of his [...] "lo real maravilloso" [...] (Gómez Gil, Jean Franco, Carlos Fuentes)", and those that use the two terms interchangeably (Fernando Alegria, Luis Leal, Emir Rodriguez Monegal).|$|E
2500|$|That {{suspension}} {{is created}} [...] "simply, by denying the listener any I chords," [...] Pallett explains. After {{the first few}} lines, the B tonic chord that repeats throughout the song is offset by bass notes that give it a more dominant 7th feel. [...] "The I chord will never appear again," [...] he observes. At the same time, however, Perry begins singing the melody <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>note,</b> and returns to it frequently, even when it clashes with the dominant V chord as she sings [...] "feel like I'm living a". [...] "he vocal melody establishes the key so clearly {{that there is no}} doubt ... Her voice is the sun and the song is in orbit around it," [...] he concludes. [...] "The insistence of the tonic in the melody keeps your ears’ eyes fixed on the destination, but the song never arrives there. Weightlessness is achieved. Great work, songwriters!" [...] Pallett notes other classic pop songs, such as Fleetwood Mac's [...] "Dreams" [...] and Coldplay's [...] "Viva La Vida", that employ the same device.|$|E

They had not the sound of a casual utterance. Vague they were to my Western mind and to my Western sentiment, but I could not forget that, standing by Miss Haldin's side, I was like a traveller in a strange country. It had also become clear to me that Miss Haldin was unwilling to enter into the details of the only material part of their visit to the Chateau Borel. But I was not hurt. Somehow I didn't feel it to be a want of confidence. It was some other difficulty--a difficulty I could not resent. And it was without the slightest resentment that I said-- ...|$|E
60|$|We {{discussed}} this, {{first of}} all, under {{the lee of}} a wet deck-house in mid-Atlantic; man after man cutting {{in and out of}} the talk as he sucked at his damp tobacco. The passengers were nearly all unmixed Canadian, mostly born in the Maritime Provinces, where their fathers speak of 'Canada' as Sussex speaks of 'England,' but scattered about their businesses throughout the wide Dominion. They were at ease, too, among themselves, with that pleasant intimacy that stamps every branch of Our Family and every boat that it uses on its homeward way. A Cape liner is all the sub-Continent from the Equator to Simon's Town; an Orient boat is Australasian throughout, and a C.P.R. steamer cannot be confused with anything except Canada. It is a pity one may not be born in four places at once, and then one would understand the half-tones and asides, and the allusions of all our Family life without waste of precious time. These big men, smoking in the drizzle, had hope in their eyes, belief in their tongues, and strength in their hearts. I used to think miserably of other boats at the South end of this ocean--a quarter full of people deprived of these things. A young man kindly explained to me how Canada had suffered through what he called 'the Imperial connection'; how she had been diversely bedevilled by English statesmen for political reasons. He did not know his luck, nor would he believe me when I tried to point it out; but a nice man in a plaid (who knew South Africa) lurched round the corner and fell on him with facts and imagery which astonished the patriotic young mind. The plaid finished his outburst with the uncontradicted statement that the English were mad. All our talks ended <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>note.</b>|$|E
