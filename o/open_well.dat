5|$|Jackson {{collaborated with}} filmmakers George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola on the 17-minute 3D film Captain EO, which debuted in September 1986 {{at both the}} {{original}} Disneyland and at Epcot in Florida, and in March 1987 at Tokyo Disneyland. The $30 million movie was a popular attraction at all three parks. A Captain EO attraction was later featured at Euro Disneyland after that park opened in 1992. All four parks' Captain EO installations stayed <b>open</b> <b>well</b> into the 1990s: the Paris installation {{was the last to}} close, in 1998. The attraction would later return to Disneyland in 2010 after Jackson's death. In 1987, Jackson disassociated himself from the Jehovah's Witnesses, in response to their disapproval of the Thriller video.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{began his}} 2013 season by {{retaining}} his Brisbane International title, defeating Grigor Dimitrov {{in the final}} in straight sets. Trying to win his second Major in a row, he began the 2013 Australian <b>Open</b> <b>well</b> with a straight sets victory over Dutchman Robin Haase. He followed this up with straight set victories over João Sousa, practice partner Ričardas Berankis and French No. 14 seed Gilles Simon. In the quarterfinals he cruised past Jérémy Chardy in straight sets {{to set up a}} semifinal clash with Roger Federer. After exchanging sets, Murray eventually prevailed in 5 sets, recording his first Grand Slam tournament triumph over Federer. With this victory, each member of the ATP's most dominant quartet of the previous four years (Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Murray) had beaten the other three at the Majors. This victory set up Murray's third consecutive Major final appearance, and second in a row against Djokovic. After taking the first set in a tiebreak, Murray was eventually defeated in four sets. His defeat in this final meant that Murray became only the second man in the Open Era to achieve three runner-up finishes at the Australian Open, the other being Stefan Edberg.|$|E

Though the humus content in the soil is low, {{it is able to}} support a variety of vegetational types, such as a small zone of wetlands, deciduous woodlands, dry scrublands and drylands.When the school was set up, <b>open</b> <b>wells</b> were the only source of water. By the 1960s, pipelines were laid from Horsley Hills to Rishi Valley. The <b>open</b> <b>wells</b> went dry for four years (1981-1985) due to extensive farming and channel irrigation. As soon as the <b>open</b> <b>wells</b> went dry, borewells were laid in order to satisfy the new water requirements of the school. The introduction of borewells led to groundwater depletion while the <b>open</b> <b>wells</b> were neglected. The introduction of borewells led to farmers changing their old agricultural patterns, shifting from dry land crops to more water-intense crops, causing the groundwater table to be further eroded.|$|R

25|$|Servia had public {{rooms of}} a scale and luxury greater than {{previously}} known. Of the three decks, {{the upper deck}} consisted of deck-houses that included a first-class smoking room, and a luxuriously fitted ladies drawing room and a music room. The entrance and grand staircase was the largest that had ever appeared on a liner, and was panelled in polished maple and ash. It led down to the a landing on the main deck which featured a library. Twenty-four first-class state-rooms were situated aft of this landing, while the first-class dining salon was situated forward. The dining salon could sit 220 of Servia's 480 first-class passengers on five long tables, and was richly decorated with carved panels and carpets. In the centre was an <b>open</b> <b>well</b> that rose 17ft to a skylight. Forward of the dining salon were a further 58 staterooms, followed by crew accommodation areas.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the ship}} was {{purchased}} by Kloster in 1979 many of the original 1960s interiors were lost as rooms were either demolished within larger renovations, or redecorated to suit Caribbean cruising, {{under the direction of}} maritime architect Tage Wandborg and New York interior designer Angelo Donghia. [...] Areas that were completely remodelled included all of the Tourist Class public rooms, and their indoor promenade areas were filled with prefabricated [...] "junior suite" [...] cabins. The former Versailles dining room, now the Leeward, , the wall finish and etched glass mural remaining; however, carpeting and furniture was replaced, the <b>open</b> <b>well</b> was lined with smoked glass and aluminium handrails, an aluminium chandelier was placed over the two-storey space, and a spiral staircase was installed to connect the two levels. The former Salon Saint Tropez became the Norway's North Cape Lounge for cabaret and other shows; the décor more dark and muted. Further forward on the same deck, the old Café Rive Gauche was transformed into the ship's Monte Carlo casino. With the promenade windows now within cabins, no daylight penetrated to the casino, and so all windows were filled in. The Tourist Class swimming pool, its glass dome gone after the construction of the open pool deck above, was filled with neon lights and covered with a glass dance floor as part of the remodelling of the entire space into the ship's Dazzles disco.|$|E

Also the snowy froth which lapped higher up the lee deck was perilously near the coaming protecting the <b>open</b> <b>well.</b> Still, our expectant friends stood clustered among the boulders fringing one horn of the bay, and I saw that Caryl held a rope in his hand.

But she had been a person to him, and the unbearable pathos of details and habit stabbed him with all the small daggers of bereavement. He remembered her pretty face and priggish speeches with a sudden secret vividness which is all the bitterness of death. In an instant like a bolt from the blue, like a thunderbolt from nowhere, that beautiful and defiant body had been dashed down the <b>open</b> <b>well</b> of the lift to death at the bottom. Was it suicide? With so insolent an optimist it seemed impossible. Was it murder? But who was there in those hardly inhabited flats to murder anybody? In a rush of raucous words, which he meant to be strong and suddenly found weak, he asked where was that fellow Kalon. A voice, habitually heavy, quiet and full, assured him that Kalon for the last fifteen minutes had been away up on his balcony worshipping his god. When Flambeau heard the voice, and felt the hand of Father Brown, he turned his swarthy face and said abruptly: ...|$|E

"Well, {{and so we}} breakfasted at ten as usual; I {{thought it}} would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid {{unpleasant}} all the time I was with them.

To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was <b>open.</b> <b>Well,</b> and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.

But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out.

I was breathless when the sail was set, but sprang aft to the helm, lifted the girl to the weather deck, and perched myself as high on that side as I could, with the mainsheet round my left wrist and my right hand on the tiller, wondering if the mast would bear the strain. The boat swayed down until her leeward deck was buried in a rush of foam and her bending mast slanted half way to the horizontal. Little clouds of spray shot up from her weather bow as, gathering way, she swept ahead, and then they gave place to sheets of water, which lashed our faces, and, sluicing deep along the decks, poured over the coaming ledge into the <b>open</b> <b>well.</b> Still, we were in comparatively smooth water where one could risk a little, and while the straining mainsheet, which I dare not make fast, sawed into my wrist, I glanced at {{my companion}}. Her hat was sodden--already her hair clung in soaked clusters to her forehead, and her wet face showed white against the dark water which raced past us. Yet it was still confident, and her voice was level as she said: [...] "Let me help you. That rope is cutting your wrist." ...|$|E

This study characterizes groundwater hydrology in the Kothapally agricultural watershed, in hard rock Deccan plateau area in India and assesses {{the impact of}} AWM interventions on groundwater recharge using a calibrated and validated hydrological model, SWAT, in combination with observed water table data in 62 geo-referenced <b>open</b> <b>wells.</b> Kothapally receives, on average, 750 mm rainfall (nearly 90 % of annual rainfall) during the monsoon season (June to October). Water balance showed that 72 % of total rainfall was converted as evapotranspiration (ET), 16 % was stored in aquifer, and 8 % exported as runoff from the watershed boundary with AWM interventions. Nearly 60 % of the runoff harvested by AWM interventions recharged shallow aquifers and rest of the 40 % increased ET. Water harvesting structures (WHS) contributed 2. 5 m additional head in <b>open</b> <b>wells,</b> whereas hydraulic head under natural condition was 3. 5 m, resulting in total 6 m rise in water table during the monsoon.
