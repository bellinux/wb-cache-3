40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a number of}} system design options are studied for the {{generation}} and processing of ultra—high speed optical data, based on the technique of Optical Time Division Multiplexing. The limits are investigated with regard to maximum unregenerated transmission distances for linear propagation over single mode fibre with large chromatic dispersion. Overall, {{the aim is to}} minimise the bandwidth requirements of electronic and opto—electronic system components for a given optical line capacity whilst at the same time maximising the chromatic dispersion limited propagation distances, thus exploring the potential for future system and network operating speeds of several tens of Gbit/s. A summary of standard system designs and their performance in terms of maximum system speed and dispersive fibre propagation provides an introduction into the field of high performance fibre optic data communication systems. Particular examples are used to introduce the device models subsequently employed in the analysis of new system configurations. This includes a description of the system performance measurements which are the basis for the performance analyses of the proposed ultra—high speed systems. In the field of fibre transmission research a variety of electrical interface and <b>optical</b> <b>line</b> <b>signal</b> formats are being investigated, each being appropriate for particular application areas and offering varying compromises between performance, complexity and user friendliness. In the context of this thesis the investigations are limited to high capacity time division multiplexed configurations, which represent a medium to longer term alternative as well as a complementary approach to the currently widely pursued system capacity upgrades by means of optical wavelength or frequency division multiplexing. Moreover, ultra—high speed time division multiplexed transmission is fundamentally compatible with WDM system operation, providing a future upgrade path for multi—wavelength systems being developed at the present time. The vehicle for these investigations is a set of computer models. Optical signal generation, pulse propagation in single—mode fibre, optical time domain processing, amplification and optical receiver detection are all included in the models to allow end—to—end system performance studies. Experimental results are presented at various stages to validate the models employed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{methodology}} for designing an octic-style optical true-time-delay (TTD) device {{based on the}} White cell (WC) is investigated. The octic cell is a “polynomial ” cell, {{one of the two}} classes of TTD White cells. This octic cell is designed to produce a maximum of 6399 delays in 17 bounces, with a unit delay of 3 ps. Glass blocks are used for short delays, white lens trains are used for the longer delays. The octic cell is designed to use a microelectromechanical tip/tilt micromirror array to direct light beams into various delay paths.

40|$|Abstract—An optical true-time delay {{device that}} uses a binary {{counting}} system in a modified White cell is demonstrated. The switching engine uses four spherical mirrors and a three-state digital micromirror array. The delay part, as designed, provides 6 bits of delay ranging from 78 ps to 5 ns, {{using a combination of}} dielectric blocks for short delays and lens trains for longer ones. Long lens trains are folded for compactness. The authors describe the design and demonstrate two of the 6 bits of delays experimentally. Delays were accurate to within the measurement resolution of 1. 25 ps. The insertion loss varied from 3. 1 – 5. 2 dB, depending on delay. It was found that the micromirrors do not contribute significantly to the loss.

40|$|Abstract—A {{low-loss}} {{and compact}} optical delay element is devised {{to be integrated}} into existing White cell-based true-time delay systems. The delay element {{is based on a}} multiple-bounce cell that consists of simple optical components,whichwasinitially described by Claude Robert for spectroscopy. We hereby provide acomprehensiveanalysisoftheRobert cell and propose that it can be modified {{in a number of ways}} to produce discrete and variable time delays up to hundreds of ns. The Robert cell show appealing traits compared to traditional optical delay devices because it relies on reflections within a system of mirrors to produce time delays, and this mechanism reduces the physical size and optical losses compared to traditional approaches for long delays. We also illustrate how modified Robert cells can be designed such that they can be compatibly combined with White cell-based true-time delay systems.
