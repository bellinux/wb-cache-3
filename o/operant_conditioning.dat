5|$|Laboratory (brown) rats {{may have}} the {{capacity}} for metacognition—to consider their own learning and then {{make decisions based on}} what they know, or do not know, as indicated by choices they make apparently trading off difficulty of tasks and expected rewards, making them the first animals other than primates to have this capacity, but these findings are disputed, since the rats may have been following simple <b>operant</b> <b>conditioning</b> principles, or a behavioral economic model.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral therapy may {{be useful}} for chronic pain. There are several types available, {{including}} <b>operant</b> <b>conditioning,</b> which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that it {{may be useful}} in improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E

5|$|Regardless, {{research}} {{has continued to}} illuminate {{the complexity of the}} lemur mind, with emphasis on the cognitive abilities of the ring-tailed lemur. As early as the mid-1970s, studies had demonstrated that they could be trained through <b>operant</b> <b>conditioning</b> using standard schedules of reinforcement. The species {{has been shown to be}} capable of learning pattern, brightness and object discrimination, skills common among vertebrates. The ring-tailed lemur has also been shown to learn a variety of complex tasks often equaling, if not exceeding, the performance of simians.|$|E
25|$|To {{strengthen}} behavior, Skinner used <b>operant</b> <b>conditioning,</b> and {{he considered}} the rate of response {{to be the most}} effective measure of response strength. To study <b>operant</b> <b>conditioning</b> he invented the <b>operant</b> <b>conditioning</b> chamber, also known as the Skinner Box, and to measure rate he invented the cumulative recorder. Using these tools, he and C. B. Ferster produced his most influential experimental work, which appeared in the book Schedules of Reinforcement.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} a Skinner box, an <b>operant</b> <b>conditioning</b> chamber is a {{laboratory}} apparatus used in the experimental analysis of behavior to study animal behavior. The <b>operant</b> <b>conditioning</b> chamber was invented in 1938 by B. F. Skinner.|$|E
50|$|As {{the above}} suggests, {{behavior}} analysis {{is based on}} the principles of <b>operant</b> and respondent <b>conditioning.</b> Applied behavior analysis (ABA) include the use of behavior management, behavioral engineering and behavior therapy.

40|$|AbstractThe {{olfactory}} nervous {{systems of}} insects and mammals exhibit many similarities, {{suggesting that the}} mechanisms for olfactory learning may be shared. Neural correlates of olfactory memory are distributed among many neurons within the olfactory nervous system. Perceptual olfactory learning may be mediated by alterations in the odorant receptive fields of second and/or third order olfactory neurons, and by increases in the coherency of activity among ensembles of second order neurons. <b>Operant</b> olfactory <b>conditioning</b> is associated {{with an increase in}} the coherent population activity of these neurons. Olfactory classical conditioning increases the odor responsiveness and synaptic activity of second and perhaps third order neurons. <b>Operant</b> and classical <b>conditioning</b> both produce an increased responsiveness to conditioned odors in neurons of the basolateral amygdala. Molecular genetic studies of olfactory learning in Drosophila have revealed numerous molecules that function within the third order olfactory neurons for normal olfactory learning...|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} a {{development}} towards combining techniques to treat psychiatric disorders.

25|$|Motivating operations, MOs, {{relate to}} the field of {{motivation}} in that they help improve understanding aspects of behavior that are not covered by <b>operant</b> <b>conditioning.</b> In <b>operant</b> <b>conditioning,</b> the function of the reinforcer is to influence future behavior. The presence of a stimulus believed to function as a reinforcer does not according to this terminology explain the current behavior of an organism – only previous instances of reinforcement of that behavior (in the same or similar situations) do. Through the behavior-altering effect of MOs, it is possible to affect current behavior of an individual, giving another piece of the puzzle of motivation.|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{operations}} may {{be classified}} {{according to whether}} they have evocative or function-altering effects. Evocative events, such as the presentation of unconditioned and conditioned stimuli, establishing operations, and discriminative stimuli, serve to increase, decrease, or maintain the momentary frequency of behavior. Function-altering operations, such as <b>operant</b> and respondent <b>conditioning,</b> the correlation of stimuli, and the presentation of certain verbal stimuli, serve to increase, decrease, or maintain the evocative and function-altering (e. g., reinforcing or punishing) functions of other events. This paper expands upon the functional taxonomy of environmental events described by Michael (1993 a). The resulting classification scheme should permit behavior analysts to more easily respond to {{similarities and differences between}} functional environmental events. This paper discusses implications of the suggested taxonomy for how behavior analysts talk about motivational variables, discriminative stimuli, the operant unit of analysis, and the distinction between <b>operant</b> and respondent <b>conditioning...</b>|$|R

25|$|The various {{mechanisms}} of <b>operant</b> <b>conditioning</b> {{may be used}} to understand the motivation for various behaviors by examining what happens just after the behavior (the consequence), in what context the behavior is performed or not performed (the antecedent), and under what circumstances (motivating operators).|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} study in which faces with a neutral {{emotional}} expression were shown on a computer screen. By means of a joystick, participants pulled half of the faces closer (positive approach movement), and pushed the half away (negative avoidance movement). As a result, an <b>operant</b> evaluative <b>conditioning</b> effect occurred in a subsequent affective priming task: Participants responded more quickly to positive target words if they were preceded by a previously pulled face than a pushed face, and vice versa for negative target words. The effect became stronger the more often the faces had been trained to approach or to avoid. No effect was observed on explicit evaluations of the faces: Pushed faces were rated as sympathetic as pulled ones...|$|R
50|$|Cognitive {{control and}} {{stimulus}} control, which {{is associated with}} <b>operant</b> and classical <b>conditioning,</b> represent opposite processes (i.e., internal vs external or environmental, respectively) that compete over the control of an individual's elicited behaviors. Cognitive control, and particularly inhibitory control over behavior, is impaired in both addiction and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Stimulus-driven behavioral responses (i.e., stimulus control) {{that are associated with}} a particular rewarding stimulus tend to dominate one's behavior in an addiction.|$|R
25|$|Honey {{bees are}} {{sensitive}} to odors (including pheromones), tastes, and colors, including ultraviolet. They can demonstrate capabilities such as color discrimination through classical and <b>operant</b> <b>conditioning</b> and retain this information for several days at least; they communicate the location and nature of sources of food; they adjust their foraging to the times at which food is available; they may even form cognitive maps of their surroundings.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time of Eysenck's work, B. F. Skinner and his {{associates}} were beginning {{to have an impact}} with their work on <b>operant</b> <b>conditioning.</b> Skinner's work was referred to as radical behaviorism and avoided anything related to cognition. However, Julian Rotter, in 1954, and Albert Bandura, in 1969, contributed behavior therapy with their respective work on social learning theory, by demonstrating the effects of cognition on learning and behavior modification.|$|E
25|$|The {{brown rat}} is nocturnal {{and is a}} good swimmer, both {{on the surface and}} underwater, and has been {{observed}} climbing slim round metal poles several feet in order to reach garden bird feeders. Brown rats dig well, and often excavate extensive burrow systems.

50|$|Cognitive {{control and}} {{stimulus}} control, which {{is associated with}} <b>operant</b> and classical <b>conditioning,</b> represent opposite processes (i.e., internal vs external or environmental, respectively) that compete over the control of an individual's elicited behaviors; in particular, inhibitory control is necessary for overriding stimulus-driven behavioral responses (i.e., stimulus control of behavior). The prefrontal cortex is necessary but not solely sufficient for executive functions; for example, the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus also {{have a role in}} mediating inhibitory control.|$|R
40|$|A {{study by}} Taffel which {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} anxiety and <b>operant</b> verbal <b>conditioning</b> was replicated. 81 neurotic and psychotic hospitalized males were assigned to 1 of 3 reinforcement groups (light, verbal, and control) and were further divided into high, medium, and low anxiety categories {{on the basis of}} MAT scores. The sentence-completion paradigm was used to induce conditioning. Results indicated that both verbal and light reinforcement groups conditioned while only Ss with low anxiety demonstrated the conditioning effect. These findings were in contradiction to those cited by Taffel, and some of the possible causes for the differences were discussed. Taffel (1955) examined the effects of anxiety on verbal conditioning and found that individuals with high anxiety levels were superior in ability to condition on an operant verbal task as compared with individuals with low anxiety levels. Since that time, however...|$|R
40|$|A {{major goal}} of {{physiological}} psychology {{is to determine}} the physical basis of mental representation. Animal models are essential to this project. Dretske's influential analysis of the concept of mental representation suggests that <b>operant</b> and classical <b>conditioning</b> involve mental representation. This analysis comports well with known physiological mechanisms of conditioning, but fails to capture necessary features of mental representation at the human level. We conclude that the applicability of animal models to the problem to human mental representation is more restricted than previously thought...|$|R
25|$|Behaviorism {{developed}} in the 1920s, and behavior modification as a therapy became popularized in the 1950s and 1960s. Notable contributors were Joseph Wolpe in South Africa, M.B. Shipiro and Hans Eysenck in Britain, and John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner in the United States. Behavioral therapy approaches relied on principles of <b>operant</b> <b>conditioning,</b> classical conditioning and social learning theory to bring about therapeutic change in observable symptoms. The approach became commonly used for phobias, {{as well as other}} disorders.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists such as Hans Eysenck have {{developed}} a personality profile for the typical smoker. Extraversion is the trait that is most associated with smoking, and smokers tend to be sociable, impulsive, risk taking, and excitement seeking individuals. Although personality and social factors may make people likely to smoke, the actual habit {{is a function of}} <b>operant</b> <b>conditioning.</b> During the early stages, smoking provides pleasurable sensations (because of its action on the dopamine system) and thus serves as a source of positive reinforcement.|$|E
25|$|Reinforcement is the {{key element}} in <b>operant</b> <b>conditioning</b> and in most {{behavior}} change programs. It is {{the process by which}} behavior is strengthened. If a behavior is followed closely in time by a stimulus and this results in an increase in the future frequency of that behavior, then the stimulus is a positive reinforcer. If the removal of an event serves as a reinforcer, this is termed negative reinforcement. There are multiple schedules of reinforcement that affect the future probability of behavior.|$|E
50|$|Another {{characteristic}} of applied behaviour analysis is how it(behaviour analysis) goes about evaluating treatment effects. The individual subject {{is where the}} focus of study is on, the investigation is centered on the one individual being treated. A third characteristic is that it focuses on what the environment does to cause significant behaviour changes. Finally the last {{characteristic of}} applied behaviour analysis {{is the use of}} those techniques that stem from <b>operant</b> and classical <b>conditioning</b> such as providing reinforcement, punishment, stimulus control and any other learning principles that may apply.|$|R
50|$|The {{behavioural}} {{approach to}} therapy assumes that behaviour that {{is associated with}} psychological problems develops through the same processes of learning that affects the development of other behaviours. Therefore, behaviourists see personality problems in the way that personality was developed. They do not look at behaviour disorders as something a person has but that it reflects how learning has influenced certain people to behave in a certain way in certain situations. Understanding how the process of learning takes place comes from research that has been done on <b>operant</b> and classical <b>conditioning.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{species have}} the ability to adapt through learning. Organisms will often learn through {{psychological}} processes, such as <b>operant</b> and classical <b>conditioning,</b> discrimination memory, and other cognitive processes. This learning process allows organisms to modify their behavior to survive in unpredictable environments. Organisms begin as naive individuals and learning allows them to obtain the knowledge they need to adapt and survive. It {{is important to remember that}} learnt adaptive behavior must have a psychological, as well as a biological, component. Without the integration of these two disciplines, behavioral adaptation cannot occur.|$|R
