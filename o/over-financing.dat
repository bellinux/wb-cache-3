40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a problem {{observed}} in federal fiscal relations: the capture of transfers received by local interest groups. Four hypotheses established in the literature are tested: capture {{is expected to increase}} with fiscal illusion, low bargaining power of the voter, <b>over-financing</b> of some local governments, and degree of poverty. The empirical tests use data from Brazilian local governments. The econometric results are coherent with the hypotheses and give hints on how to prevent capture when designing an intergovernmental transfer system...|$|E
40|$|The paper derives two {{analytical}} {{consequences of}} informed finance: Equity leads to under-financing, while debt leads to <b>over-financing.</b> We show that our model can explain key {{qualitative and quantitative}} features of informed venture capital finance in the United States. Using only four model parameters we match: (1) the venture capitalist’s equity share; (2) the venture capitalist’s expected return and (3) its standard deviation; (4) {{the probability that a}} project receives funding; and (5) the probability the venture capitalist loses money on an investment. Our estimated parameters reveal the average quality of an unfunded project; the percentage of uncertainty resolved by the venture capitalists investigation; the percentage of total surplus accruing to the venture capitalist, and the magnitude of underfinancing associated with venture capital finance...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} model of {{informed}} finance that explains the key qualitative and quantitative features of informed venture capital finance in the United States. We show that the two key features of our model— potential investors are better judges than entrepreneurs of a project’s economic viability and projects require both significant external funding and entrepreneurial inputs—give rise to under-financing with equity and <b>over-financing</b> with debt. We then take the model to the data. Using only four model parameters we match: (1) the venture capitalist’s equity share; (2) the venture capitalist’s expected return and (3) its standard deviation; (4) {{the probability that a}} project receives funding; and (5) the probability the venture capitalist loses money on an investment. Our estimated parameters reveal the average quality of an unfunded project; the percentage of uncertainty resolved by the venture capitalists investigation; the percentage of total surplus accruing to the venture capitalist, and the magnitude of underfinancing associated with venture capital finance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{describe}} how Shenzhen A-share listed companies used funds raised in <b>over-financed</b> IPOs during the 2006 – 2010 period. In exploring {{the relationship between}} internal corporate governance {{and the use of}} funds raised in <b>over-financed</b> IPOs, we find that the use of such funds to engage in severe over-investment behavior is prevalent among listed companies. Reasonable internal corporate governance mechanisms can effectively alleviate over-investment problems listed companies encounter in using funds raised in <b>over-financed</b> IPOs. However, the same individual serving as both chairman and CEO leads to funds raised in <b>over-financed</b> IPOs being over-invested. Moreover, executives driven by high levels of monetary compensation are more likely to use funds raised in such IPOs to engage in over-investment. We find that improving the balance of power between shareholders will help alleviate the over-investment of excess IPO funds. In addition, the over-investment problem is less severe in state-controlled listed companies than in their non-state-controlled listed counterparts. This study provides policy recommendations for Chinese securities regulators to ensure listed companies use funds raised in <b>over-financed</b> IPOs both rationally and effectively...|$|R
40|$|The smart market {{information}} service (MIS) combines market prices with the farmer s savvy. We {{look at some}} success stories which have made some farmers very happy indeed, but how long can it all last? We all have at least one, locked up in the cupboard of our memories. The Marketing Board. Remember it? It s not that long ago {{that they were being}} wound up, as part of the text-book practices and prescriptions of those fresh-faced visitors from somewhere out in outer space known as Structural Adjustment. How many shed a tear when their board folded? Did you? Not that the Marketing Boards were really theirs, for they did not belong in reality to the individual farmer or trader. No, it was more the other way around, or at least seemed to be, if the truth be told. Normally the boards for all sorts of commodities - were statal bodies, some with private participation at the beginning, and many of them being gradually, or abruptly, privatised as their numbers were being written ever more clearly on the wall. 'At least you knew where you were with the board, though' is a common refrain to be heard in any discussion of a group of farmers when the talk turns to nostalgia. In an way of life that must seem alien to people below the age of twenty, {{they were part of the}} cradle to grave philosophy of an overbearing top-down economic approach. The board provided the farmer with seeds and tools, set production quotas, fixed prices, made loans, paid out fixed earnings, provided training and extension services and settled scores. Not only did the farmer know where he stood (the board tended to deal more with men than women farmers), but so did traders, processors and the Minister of Finance, who were assured in advance of prices and revenues. At times, it seemed that the only uncertainty was the weather, since even the most powerful board could not regulate that, though some may have wanted to do so. Bye bye board, hallo market And then, one day, the marketing boards were gone, and the market place stood unfamiliarly empty. Producers literally scurried for cover, like beetles from an overturned stone, uncertain of where, and on what terms, to buy their inputs and sell their outputs. Traders, more flush with cash and confidence than most farmers, were able to dictate prices for a while. Gradually, market services were developed and put in place, often by enterprising former officers of the defunct boards or civil servants. In so doing they demonstrated yet again that wherever there is some sure supply and some tangible demand there is a market. And a market for {{market information}} services there surely was. It is a new way of organising what has to be one of the oldest professions in the world the middleman (or woman), the broker. Whether we are looking at the trade routes along the coast of West Africa, dominated for thousands of years by brokers from Benin and Phoenicia (Lebanon in today s terms), or the inroads made in the Horn of Africa all the way to the Great Lakes by traders from Oman and Gujarat, long before the first fresh-faced wave of European colonialism, or at the cattle and meat commodities markets in Brazil and the mid-West of America, you ll always find one on the first boat or bus in. For many producers, processors and purchasers on the ACP food chain, the last two decades have seen more changes to their use of markets and market information than just the loss of stable prices and certain supplies. The dropping of tariff barriers and duties, and the overall liberalisation of trade has led to increased competition from producers elsewhere in the world. In essence, to be able to compete fairly is a fairer system, but such was the effect of the ingrained protection of marketing boards that their removal has led to squeals of unfair and unjust. In a very real sense, the emergence of MIS has helped to lessen the pain. The rude awakening has led to the need for greater market alertness, and dealing with the associated practices of just-in-time delivery, and out-sourcing of products and services. With global, literally planet-wide, ordering networks and delivery chains now in place, it is possible for even a small and previously isolated ACP producer, or group of producers, to hook into distant markets. But you have to know how. To maximise these opportunities, a smart producer will also want to follow trends in hitherto unknown markets. It is no longer enough to know the dead certainties : for a Kenyan fruit grower to know that the British have a massive surge in strawberry consumption during the June weeks of tennis at Wimbledon, or the Zimbabwean horticulturist to know that the annual peak of all flower purchases in Austria is in the week in September that secondary school examination results are announced. These dates are known years in advance. More than that, a smart mango producer in, say, Mali, may want to know not only what fruits are in fashion in Europe this year, but what produce is being prepared for promotion next year? What are the Brazilians up to? A women s jam making cooperative in Grenada may want to know what the projected volumes of tourist arrivals are for the coming season not only in their own country but in neighbouring countries too. Is UNIDO helping a British supermarket owner set up a large jam factory that could spell doom for them? Any level, any produce, but not any price The task of an MIS is, therefore, much more than simply to provide price information to producers, and offers of supply to purchasers. As MISs establish themselves in most ACP countries, the first challenge is to define the scope of its coverage, in manageable amounts and periods. Scoring on the market place means exploiting your comparative advantage as a supplier, or being better informed than any other potential purchaser. An MIS can operate at any level, handle any type of produce or inputs, deal with any volumes; the more complex the demands of the trading parties, the greater the complexity of the system. The tendency is therefore to computerise, and to link up a local MIS with similar MISs in other localities, and with national and international networks. This can place an MIS under technical stress. The converse can be true too, with highly capitalised MISs following the sadly repeated path of many development projects of being excessively ambitious, over-manned, <b>over-financed</b> and under-used. Several services in the Caribbean and West Africa run the risk of being coffee-table exercises, of no use to farmers or to traders in the market place. Yet again, with a more measured and modulated approach to project design, some basic market research and an understanding of local conditions, many efforts could be much better focussed. Who pays in the end? The prime challenge to establishing and keeping an effective and sustainable MIS is not in getting the technical mix right: it is in achieving financial viability. This is going to have to rely largely on generating income from its users, along the age-old lines of the market place. In some MISs, such as that operated by KACE in Kenya, the standard fee for brokering a transaction is 2 % of the agreed sale price. With that sort of fee, there is obviously going to be a temptation for MIS operators to live from being a trading enterprise itself, or from sub-letting its facilities for other uses, or offering technical services. Fair enough, if it can be managed, but the clear risk is that the attention paid to necessary information will wane, and the quality of service to the stakeholder farmer will worsen. Income from users, as with any network at a given stage of its development, depends on their satisfaction and continued loyalty. In that sense, the idea of providing value-adding services to price information is a sensible way to build up user loyalty, and thus turnover. The problem arises when users are savvy enough to do their own deals directly, without any broker service. When the MIS has no more tricks or special information up its sleeve, it will wither and die. That was not the point of all the investment made in these services. The next step, then, is to help MIS operators to adapt themselves to the changing market place and to stay one step ahead of the competition. Which is where they came in.

40|$|Credit pricing {{is always}} an {{important}} aspect of operations of banks, as loans are generally two thirds of bank assets. Therefore, the study of factors influencing a bank customer behavior and their impact on early repayment of loans may have a significant influence in reducing the risk assumed by such unexpected operations. Objective analysis of prepayment risk is to estimate the probability of repayment to better manage its manifestation. The existence of potential customers that use this option exposes the bank to a number of risks, such as interest rate risk, the maturity mismatch risk and liquidity risk. Proper evaluation and forecasting the evolution of this risk can bring great benefits for a credit institution in the management of loan products and customer relationship: lower risk of over-ensure against fixed rate mortgage, a better management of short-term and long term liquidity needs (thus reducing the risk of <b>over-financing)</b> can offer customers more competitive pricing (achieved by reducing funding costs due to better assessment and management of risks involved early repayment) ...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Comparar el tamaño promedio de las familias del Seguro Popular de Salud (SPS) e identificar las {{variables}} que mejor predicen la afiliación unipersonal. MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: Se comparan tamaños promedios de familias según los Padrones 2004 a 2006 del SPS y otras fuentes. Se ajustan modelos logísticos para identificar las variables explicativas de la afiliación como familia unipersonal. RESULTADOS: Las familias del SPS en promedio tienen un miembro menos respecto de otras fuentes. Los modelos logísticos indican que cuanto más reciente es el año de afiliación tanto mayor es la probabilidad de afiliarse como familia unipersonal CONCLUSIONES: El menor número de miembros por familia afiliada implica un sobrefinanciamiento al SPS. Se recomienda cambiar la unidad de financiamiento hacia la persona, para apoyar el sostenimiento financiero y operativo del SPS en el mediano y largo plazos. OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} average size of families affiliated with Popular Health Insurance (SPS, abbrev. in Spanish) and identify variables that best predict single-person affiliation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Average sizes {{of families in}} the SPS are compared using 2004 - 2006 enrollment records and other sources. Logistic models are used to identify explanatory variables for affiliation as a single-person family. RESULTS: SPS families on average are composed of one member less in comparison with other sources. The logistic models indicate that the more recent the affiliation year the more probable is affiliation as a single-person family. CONCLUSIONS: The smaller number of family members implies an <b>over-financing</b> by the SPS. It is recommended to change the unit of financing to the individual to help the operational and financial sustainability of the SPS over the mid- to long-term...|$|E
40|$|Background: Efforts {{to control}} STI/HIV in sub-Saharan Africa {{has met with}} difficulties. Although the {{epidemic}} seems to be levelling off, prevalence and incidence are still high in many parts. In spite of 20 years of HIV control activities little or no behavioural change {{has been reported in}} Tanzania. Reasons for this could be that determinants of transmission have not been properly addressed or that changing sexual behavioural patterns is difficult and demands long-term interventions to succeed. It could also be that the balance between prevention and care is not optimal or that implementation has not been efficient. In my studies I have focused on the health system and how interventions are planned and implemented. Objective : The overall objective is to identify and characterise major obstacles to the control of sexually transmitted infections and HIV in Zambia and Tanzania, respectively. Methods : In papers I and II we determined treatment efficacy and the quality of STI care through participant observation and patient interviews. The main method in papers III and IV-VI was participant observation including interviews and the study of grey and published literature. In paper VII the capacity for antiretroviral treatment (ART) was estimated through a scenario analysis. Main findings : Paper I showed that the Zambian STI treatment algorithms for genital ulcers were not efficacious as the treatment for chancroid lacked efficacy; paper II demonstrated that the health education part of syndromic management including condom promotion was poor and that vaginal examinations were rarely carried out. Paper III has two components. One is on health sector reform including effects of integration of HIV control activities into horizontal functions and the other on management aspects of STI/HIV control in Tanzania - also the subject of papers IV-VI. There are large differences in prevalence within Tanzania. The limited analysis of disease determinants and the little efforts at explaining these have resulted in plans that do not forcefully tackle the core problems surrounding sexual behaviour and the probability for transmission. Furthermore, since policies in many HIV related areas, such as ART, are linked to international politics, there is a large gap between policies and national and local resources. This has often led to the formulation of unrealistic plans, which are poorly adapted to the resource limitations and therefore rarely fully implemented. Instead they are outlined to attract funding. This has increased drastically during the last few years, but the human resources have remained limited. Although better funding opens up for improvements, <b>over-financing</b> will not increase service output much. The ongoing health sector reform has had to consider a situation of limited resources and how these should be allocated. The short-term interest of effective HIV control has stood against the long-term needs to strengthen the whole system - a dilemma not yet resolved, and now further complicated by over-funding for ART. Paper VII shows that international plans for an ART scale up are unrealistic and that only part of the treatment targets set in the national plan are likely to be met mainly {{due to the lack of}} qualified staff. Conclusions : Disease determinants need to be further researched and analysed. Country specific plans are needed. Current plans for HIV control are neither realistic nor adapted to actual resources causing distortion to how these are used. Plans have to aim at an optimal balance between prevention and care, and focus on the core of the problem: determinants of new infections. Operational issues have to be tackled. Neither STI case management nor ARV treatment currently contribute much directly to a reduction of HIV incidence, but may, if reinforced, add to the effect of prevention efforts. A multi-component prevention programme, if prioritised and scaled up, might - through synergistic interaction have a major effect of the epidemic and significantly reduce HIV incidence...|$|E
