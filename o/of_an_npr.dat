Observations of interactions in a cancer treatment unit included 60 videotaped, sequential, naturally occurring NPIs involving one dyad over a 3 -day period. A microanalysis of the interactions was conducted using qualita-tive ethological methods. The analysis focused on identifying important recur-ring behavioral clusters and characteristic patterns of behavior that comprised these clusters. Important features of NPIs in the development <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>NPR</b> were identified and described in detail. The active and complementary roles of both participants in this process and the contribution of social exchange, trust, and humor are highlighted.

40|$|Citrus canker is {{a devastating}} disease caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Xac).   The NPR 1 gene plays {{a pivotal role}} in {{systemic}} acquired resistance (SAR) in Arabidopsis.   We report the isolation and characterization <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>NPR</b> 1 homolog from citrus, namely Citrus NPR 1 homolog 1 (CtNH 1).   When over-expressed in citrus, CtNH 1 confers resistance to Xac and leads to constitutive expression of the pathogenesis-related (PR) gene chitinase 1 (Chi 1), suggesting that CtNH 1 is orthologous to NPR 1.   In addition, we recently identified two closely-related citrus genes, named Xbct 31 and Xbct 32.   Database searching and sequence analyses reveals that other plant species, including rice, Arabidopsis, tomato, and Nicotiana benthamiana, contain homologs of these two citrus genes and they share high levels of sequence identity at the amino acid level.   When overexpressed in Nicotiana benthamiana via Agrobacterium infiltration-mediated transient expression, the citrus genes as well as their closely-related homologs from rice and Arabidopsis all trigger (HR) -like cell death hypersensitive response.   Since HR is often associated with resistance (R) gene-mediated immunity, our data suggests Xbct 3 s represent a family of evolutionarily conserved defense regulators and could be used to heighten defense against citrus diseases including greening and canker...|$|E
40|$|Cac 3 p/Msi 1 p, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog of retinoblastoma-associated protein 48 (RbAp 48), is a {{component}} of chromatin assembly factor I (CAF-I), a complex that assembles histones H 3 and H 4 onto replicated DNA. CAC 3 overexpression also suppresses the RAS/cyclic AMP (cAMP) signal transduction pathway by an unknown mechanism. We investigated this mechanism and found that CAC 3 suppression of RAS/cAMP signal transduction was independent of either CAC 1 or CAC 2, subunits required for CAF-I function. CAC 3 suppression was also independent of other chromatin-modifying activities, indicating that Cac 3 p has at least two distinct, separable functions, one in chromatin assembly and one in regulating RAS function. Unlike Cac 1 p, which localizes primarily to the nucleus, Cac 3 p localizes to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In addition, Cac 3 p associates with Npr 1 p, a cytoplasmic kinase that stablizes several nutrient transporters by antagonizing a ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway. Deletion of NPR 1, like overexpression of Cac 3 p, suppressed the RAS/cAMP pathway. Furthermore, NPR 1 overexpression interfered with the ability of CAC 3 to suppress the RAS/cAMP pathway, indicating that extra Cac 3 p suppresses the RAS/cAMP pathway by sequestering Npr 1 p. Deletion of NPR 1 {{did not affect the}} quantity, phosphorylation state, or localization of Ras 2 p. Consistent with the idea that Npr 1 p exerts its effect on the RAS/cAMP pathway by antagonizing a ubiquitin-mediated process, excess ubiquitin suppressed both the heat shock sensitivity and the sporulation defects caused by constitutive activation of the RAS/cAMP pathway. Thus, CAC 3 /MSI 1 regulates the RAS/cAMP pathway via a chromatin-independent mechanism that involves the sequestration of Npr 1 p and {{may be due to the}} increased ubiquitination <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Npr</b> 1 p substrate...|$|E
40|$|Stephen (Steve) Kaffka came to UC Santa Cruz as a {{philosophy}} student in 1967 and began volunteering in Alan Chadwick’s Student Garden Project {{in the same}} year. He worked side-by-side with Alan Chadwick and eventually became the student president of the Garden in 1968. In this oral history, conducted by Ellen Farmer at her house in Santa Cruz, California on August 31, 2007, Kaffka shares his recollections of Alan Chadwick and the Garden in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s, {{as well as the}} period after Chadwick left, when Kaffka managed the Farm and Garden and formalized the apprentice program through University of California Santa Cruz Extension. Although Alan Chadwick was deeply troubled by the specialization and fragmentation of scientific practice within the academy, paradoxically, Kaffka, perhaps Chadwick’s closest apprentice at UCSC, ended up with a distinguished career as a research agronomist. After he left UC Santa Cruz in 1977, Kaffka earned his Ph. D. in agronomy from Cornell University, and now directs UC Davis’s Center for Integrated Farming Systems. He is also director of the California Biomass Collaborative and extension specialist in the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of California, Davis. He chairs the BioEnergy Work Group for the University of California’s Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and participates on several advisory committees for the California Energy Commission and California Air Resources Board. Kaffka conducts research on water quality and agriculture in the Upper Klamath Basin, and the reuse of saline drainage water for crop, forage, energy biomass feedstocks and livestock production in salt-affected areas of the San Joaquin Valley. He has M. S. and Ph. D. degrees from Cornell University in agronomy and a B. S. from UC Santa Cruz in biology.

40|$|The cpr 5 mutant was {{identified}} from a screen for constitutive expression of {{systemic acquired resistance}} (SAR). This single recessive mutation also leads to spontaneous expression of chlorotic lesions and reduced trichome development. The cpr 5 plants {{were found to be}} constitutively resistant to two virulent pathogens, Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola ES 4326 and Peronospora parasitica Noco 2; to have endogenous expression of the pathogenesis-related gene 1 (PR- 1); and to have <b>an</b> elevated level <b>of</b> salicylic acid (SA). Lines homozygous for cpr 5 and either the SA-degrading bacterial gene nahG or the SA-insensitive mutation npr 1 do not express PR- 1 or exhibit resistance to P. s. maculicola ES 4326. Therefore, we conclude that cpr 5 acts upstream of SA in inducing SAR. However, the cpr 5 npr 1 plants retained heightened resistance to P. parasitica Noco 2 and elevated expression of the defensin gene PDF 1. 2, implying that NPR 1 -independent resistance signaling also occurs. We conclude that the cpr 5 mutation leads to constitutive expression <b>of</b> both <b>an</b> <b>NPR</b> 1 -dependent and <b>an</b> <b>NPR</b> 1 -independent SAR pathway. Identification of this mutation indicates that these pathways are connected in early signal transduction steps and that they have overlapping functions in providing resistance...|$|R

30|$|The {{induction}} of AtPR- 1 {{and other}} PR genes during SAR {{relies on the}} expression <b>of</b> <b>a</b> functional <b>NPR</b> 1 (non-expressor of pathogenesis-related genes 1), which is a conserved central positive regulator of SA signaling (Durrant and Dong, 2004). Recently, NPR 1 was found {{to serve as a}} receptor for SA through Cys 521 / 529 in Arabidopsis (Wu et al., 2012). Mutations in NPR 1 result in breached local basal resistance and <b>a</b> higher accumulation <b>of</b> virulent pathogens, such as Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola (Glazebrook et al., 1996). In contrast, overexpression of NPR 1 protein enhances broad-spectrum disease resistance in Arabidopsis, rice and wheat, suggesting that the NPR 1 -mediated defense mechanism is evolutionary conserved across <b>a</b> wide range <b>of</b> species (Cao et al., 1998; Chern et al., 2001; Makandar et al., 2006). In addition, NPR 1 homologs from rice (OsNPR 1 /NH 1), Theobroma cacao (TcNPR 1), or Vitis vinifera (VvNPR 1.1) were able to complement <b>an</b> <b>npr</b> 1 mutation in Arabidopsis (Le Henanff et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2010). However, in contrast to NPR 1 overexpression in Arabidopsis, the overexpression of OsNPR 1 /NH 1 in rice spontaneously activated resistant genes and resulted in a lesion-mimic phenotype (Chern et al., 2005). This result indicates regulation diversities in SAR among different species.|$|R
