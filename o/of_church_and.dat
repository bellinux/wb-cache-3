5|$|Anti-Communist {{sentiment}} {{gripped the}} United States during the Cold War beginning in 1946. Federal investigations caused many persons with Communist or left-leaning affiliations {{to lose their}} jobs, become blacklisted, or be jailed. During the Cold War, although the United States collectively ignored {{the civil rights of}} Communists, other civil liberties—such as due process in law and separation <b>of</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> state—continued to be reinforced and even expanded.|$|E
40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused {{on the issue of the}} economy <b>of</b> <b>churches</b> <b>and</b> {{religious}} societies in the context <b>of</b> so-called <b>church</b> restitution. The first section focuses on the position <b>of</b> <b>churches</b> <b>and</b> religious societies within civil society, the legislative framework <b>of</b> <b>churches</b> <b>and</b> religious societies, the <b>church</b> restitution <b>and</b> their current form, as well as the economy <b>of</b> <b>churches</b> <b>and</b> religious societies. The empirical section attempts to answer the outlined research questions. It explains the consequences <b>of</b> <b>church</b> restitution for the selected sample <b>of</b> <b>churches</b> in relation to the <b>church</b> economy, <b>and</b> it focuses on the church entrepreneurship in the context <b>of</b> <b>church</b> restitution...|$|R

5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1940s, Black wrote {{decisions}} relating to the establishment clause, where he insisted on the strict separation <b>of</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> state. The most notable of these was Engel v. Vitale (1962), which declared state-sanctioned prayer in public schools unconstitutional. This provoked considerable opposition, especially in conservative circles. Efforts to restore school prayer by constitutional amendment failed.|$|E
5|$|Beneath the ealdormen, reeves—royal {{officials}} who were noble local landowners—were {{in charge of}} a town or royal estate. The authority <b>of</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> state was not separated in early medieval societies, and the lay officials worked closely with their diocesan bishop and local abbots, who also attended the king's royal councils.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Slayer {{released}} Divine Intervention, the band's {{first record}} with drummer Bostaph. The album featured songs about Reinhard Heydrich, an {{architect of the}} Holocaust, and Jeffrey Dahmer, an American serial killer and sex offender. Other themes included murder, the evils <b>of</b> <b>church,</b> <b>and</b> the lengths to which governments will go to wield power, Araya's interest in serial killers inspired much {{of the content of}} the lyrics.|$|E

5|$|Justice Harlan {{supported}} {{many of the}} Warren Court's landmark decisions {{relating to}} the separation <b>of</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> state. For instance, he {{voted in favor of}} the Court's ruling that the states could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office in Torcaso v. Watkins. He joined in Engel v. Vitale, which declared that it was unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools. In , similarly, he voted to strike down an Arkansas law banning the teaching of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Scotland has {{inherited}} {{two main}} features from the Roman period, although mostly indirectly: {{the use of}} the Latin script for its languages and the emergence of Christianity as the predominant religion. Through Christianity, the Latin language would become used by the natives of Scotland for the purposes <b>of</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> government for centuries more.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU is {{supported}} by a variety of persons and organizations. There were over 1,000,000 members in 2017, and the ACLU annually receives thousands of grants from hundreds of charitable foundations.

5|$|The Scopes {{trial was}} a phenomenal public {{relations}} {{success for the}} ACLU. The ACLU became well known across America, and the case led to the first endorsement of the ACLU by a major U.S. newspaper. The ACLU continued {{to fight for the}} separation <b>of</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> state in schoolrooms, decade after decade, including the 1982 case McLean v. Arkansas and the 2005 case Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District.|$|E
5|$|After {{going without}} a rabbi {{for another two}} years, in 1921 Temple Sinai hired Rudolph I. Coffee, an Oakland native and cousin of Judah Leon Magnes. Coffee was outspoken, and passionately {{advocated}} liberal causes: he supported disarmament, birth control, and separation <b>of</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> state, and opposed prohibition, antisemitism, and Tammany Hall. Along with other local rabbis Jacob Nieto and Jacob Weinstein, he demanded the release of labor leaders and accused bombers Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings. He also supported California's compulsory sterilization {{of the mentally ill}} and mentally retarded, and eugenicist E. S. Gosney's advocacy on this issue.|$|E
5|$|After the First Crusade's {{capture of}} Jerusalem and victory at Ascalon the {{majority}} of the Crusaders considered their pilgrimage complete and returned to Europe. Godfrey was left with only 300 knights and 2,000 infantry to defend the territory won in the Eastern Mediterranean. Only Tancred of the crusader princes remained with the aim of establishing his own lordship. At this point the Franks held only Jerusalem and two great Syrian cities; Antioch and Edessa but not the surrounding country. Jerusalem remained economically sterile despite the advantages of being the centre of administration <b>of</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> state and benefitting from streams of pilgrims.|$|E

5|$|As {{a patron}} James V {{supported}} poets William Stewart and John Bellenden. Stewart produced a verse {{version of the}} Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Boece and Bellenden produced a prose translation of Livy's History of Rome in 1533. Sir David Lindsay of the Mount the Lord Lyon, {{the head of the}} Lyon Court and diplomat, was a prolific poet. He produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540, the first surviving full Scottish play, which satirised the corruption <b>of</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> state, making use of elements such as medieval morality plays, with a humanist agenda.|$|E
5|$|By 1964, {{membership}} {{had risen}} to 80,000, and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand civil liberties. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce separation <b>of</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> state. It defended several anti-war activists during the Vietnam War. The ACLU {{was involved in the}} Miranda case, which addressed conduct by police during interrogations, and in the New York Times case, which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, involving the rights of homosexuals, students, prisoners, and the poor. In the twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of creationism in public schools and challenged some provisions of anti-terrorism legislation as infringing on privacy and civil liberties. Fundraising and membership spiked after the 2016 election; the ACLU's current membership is more than 1.2 million.|$|E
5|$|Coddington {{and several}} others left the colony, {{establishing}} the settlement of Newport {{at the south end}} of the island. The freemen of Pocasset changed the name of their town to Portsmouth. They adopted a new government which provided for trial by jury and separation <b>of</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> state. The men who accompanied Coddington to Newport tended to be the strongest leaders; several became presidents or governors of the entire united colony after 1646, such as Coggeshall, Nicholas Easton, William Brenton, Jeremy Clarke, and Henry Bull. On 12 March 1640, the towns of Portsmouth and Newport agreed to re-unite peacefully. Coddington became governor of the island, and William Hutchinson was chosen as one of his assistants. The towns were to remain autonomous with laws made by the citizens.|$|E

5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} {{allegations of}} Rush Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy {{should not have}} been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United for Separation <b>of</b> <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route20, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} Elbridge to Rochester via Fairport. Initially, Route20 entered the village on High Street and followed Main Street south across the Erie Canal to Church Street, where it turned west toward Rochester. On March1, 1921, Route20 was realigned to enter Monroe County on modern NY31. At {{the junction of}} Palmyra and Moseley Roads, Route20 turned north, following SH1290 into Fairport. It rejoined its original alignment at the junction <b>of</b> <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> Main Streets. None of SH1290 received a signed designation when {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924.|$|E
5|$|In October 1917, Lenin {{issued a}} decree {{limiting}} work {{for everyone in}} Russia to eight hours per day. He also issued the Decree on Popular Education that stipulated {{that the government would}} guarantee free, secular education for all children in Russia, and a decree establishing a system of state orphanages. To combat mass illiteracy, a literacy campaign was initiated; an estimated 5 million people enrolled in crash courses of basic literacy from 1920 to 1926. Embracing the equality of the sexes, laws were introduced that helped to emancipate women, by giving them economic autonomy from their husbands and removing restrictions on divorce. A Bolshevik women's organisation, Zhenotdel, was established to further these aims. Militantly atheist, Lenin and the Communist Party wanted to demolish organised religion, and in January 1918 the government decreed the separation <b>of</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> state and prohibited religious instruction in schools.|$|E
