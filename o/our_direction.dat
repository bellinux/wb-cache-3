500|$|The Natural History is encyclopaedic in scope, but its {{format is}} unlike a modern encyclopaedia. However, {{it does have}} structure: Pliny uses Aristotle's {{division}} of nature (animal, vegetable, mineral) to recreate the natural world in literary form. Rather than presenting compartmentalised, stand-alone entries arranged alphabetically, Pliny's ordered natural landscape is a coherent whole, offering the reader a guided tour: [...] "a brief excursion under <b>our</b> <b>direction</b> among {{the whole of the}} works of nature..." [...] The work is unified but varied: [...] "My subject is the world of nature... or in other words, life," [...] he tells Titus.|$|E
500|$|At that time, a Parisian ballet {{audience}} typically {{consisted of}} two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a [...] "Bohemian" [...] group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would [...] "acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes". Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions [...] began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: [...] "Everything available was tossed in <b>our</b> <b>direction,</b> but we continued to play on". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with {{the intervention of the}} police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. Things grew noticeably quieter during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final [...] "Sacrificial Dance" [...] was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{organised}} as follows. In Section 2, {{we discuss the}} class of subset decision problems and show the generic clp(FD) constraint store that results from such problems.

2500|$|In {{doing so}} they {{activated}} [...] "a kind of reverse thrust, and [...] lights became dazzlingly bright". To match {{the speed of}} the aircraft from their sideways approach, the objects displayed what Terauchi described as a disregard for inertia: [...] "The thing was flying as if {{there was no such thing}} as gravity. It sped up, then stopped, then flew at our speed, in <b>our</b> <b>direction,</b> so that to us it [...] standing still. The next instant it changed course. ... In other words, the flying object had overcome gravity." [...] The [...] "reverse thrust" [...] caused a bright flare for three to seven seconds, to the extent that captain Terauchi could feel the warmth of their glows.|$|E

40|$|The {{advantages}} of gallium lanthanum sulphide (GLS) based glass over other competing glasses for active and infrared applications are evident through its low-phonon energy, high rare-earth solubility, high transition temperature and non-toxicity. However this glass often devitrifies during fibre drawing {{due to a}} small separation between the crystallisation and fibre drawing temperatures. Improving GLS fabrication technology may {{hold the key to}} achieving practical optical waveguide devices.

40|$|Future {{networks}} are ones in which mobile users are immersed in sensor networks. Application domains such as smart homes, intelligent construction sites, and social networking require users moving through an environment {{to collect and}} process data available in that environment. However, even as sensors become increasingly prevalent in our environments, {{only a handful of}} applications are available to interact with and process the available sensor data. Poor usability accounts for a good portion of this disparity. In this paper we discuss <b>our</b> <b>directions</b> in creating an architecture for making such sensor data usable by application developers. This has the potential to widen the accessibility of developing mobile applications on embedded sensor networks beyond the niche markets it now enjoys...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the motivation {{and design of}} a software platform for kernellevel programming in Common Lisp on the x 86 PC architecture.

The platform offers a cross-compiler, and aims to provide a viable alternative to the C and assembly-based development that is prevalent in kernel-level programming today. We present our experiences and on-going work with Movitz, its current status and potential as a development platform, and <b>our</b> <b>directions</b> for future work. 1...|$|R
