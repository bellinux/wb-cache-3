25|$|The {{following}} table summarizes {{usage of}} UTF-8 code units (individual bytes or <b>octets)</b> in a code page format. The upper half (0_ to 7_) is for bytes used only in single-byte codes, {{so it looks}} like a normal code page; the lower half is for continuation bytes (8_ to B_) and (possible) leading bytes (C_ to F_), and is explained further in the legend below.|$|E
25|$|The strangeness flavour {{quantum number}} S (not to be {{confused}} with spin) was noticed to go up and down along with particle mass. The higher the mass, the lower the strangeness (the more s quarks). Particles could be described with isospin projections (related to charge) and strangeness (mass) (see the uds octet and decuplet figures on the right). As other quarks were discovered, new quantum numbers were made to have similar description of udc and udb <b>octets</b> and decuplets. Since only the u and d mass are similar, this description of particle mass and charge in terms of isospin and flavour quantum numbers works well only for octet and decuplet made of one u, one d, and one other quark, and breaks down for the other <b>octets</b> and decuplets (for example, ucb octet and decuplet). If the quarks all had the same mass, their behaviour would be called symmetric, as they would all behave {{in exactly the same way}} with respect to the strong interaction. Since quarks do not have the same mass, they do not interact in the same way (exactly like an electron placed in an electric field will accelerate more than a proton placed in the same field because of its lighter mass), and the symmetry is said to be broken.|$|E

25|$|The bassoon is {{infrequently}} {{used as a}} jazz {{instrument and}} rarely seen in a jazz ensemble. It first began appearing in the 1920s, including specific calls for its use in Paul Whiteman's group, the unusual <b>octets</b> of Alec Wilder, {{and a few other}} session appearances. The next few decades saw the instrument used only sporadically, as symphonic jazz fell out of favor, but the 1960s saw artists such as Yusef Lateef and Chick Corea incorporate bassoon into their recordings. Lateef's diverse and eclectic instrumentation saw the bassoon as a natural addition (see, e.g., The Centaur and the Phoenix (1960) which features bassoon as part of a 6-man horn section, including a few solos) while Corea employed the bassoon in combination with flautist Hubert Laws.|$|E
25|$|Earlier lineups of {{the band}} were sextets and <b>octets</b> {{employing}} extensive use of saxophones, percussion and live keyboards. From 1991 onwards, the band was a rock power quartet centred on two guitars (with the remaining keyboard and percussion parts sequenced on tape). Vocally, Cardiacs employ a distinctive singing style centred on Tim Smith's lead vocals (reedy and high-pitched, with a strong punk-styled Estuary English accent) and choral sections (varying from yelled to falsetto) involving most or all {{of the band}}. Smith's singing style has been described by music critics as 'skittish'; it has also been commented that his singing voice sounds very similar to his speaking one. The band's music is written almost entirely by Tim Smith, although contributions have been made by other group members.|$|E

The most common network addressing architecture is Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), but its successor, IPv6, has been increasingly deployed since approximately 2006. An IPv4 address consists of 32 bits, for readability written in a form consisting of four decimal <b>octets</b> separated by dots, called dot-decimal notation. An IPv6 address consists of 128 bits written in a hexadecimal notation and grouping 16 bits [...] called a hextet [...] separated by colons.|$|E
2500|$|From 1936, Ellington {{began to}} make {{recordings}} with smaller groups (sextets, <b>octets,</b> and nonets) drawn from his then-15-man orchestra and he composed pieces intended to feature a specific instrumentalist, as with [...] "Jeep's Blues" [...] for Johnny Hodges, [...] "Yearning for Love" [...] for Lawrence Brown, [...] "Trumpet in Spades" [...] for Rex Stewart, [...] "Echoes of Harlem" [...] for Cootie Williams and [...] "Clarinet Lament" [...] for Barney Bigard. In 1937, Ellington returned to the Cotton Club which had relocated to the mid-town Theater District. In the summer of that year, his father died, and due to many expenses, Ellington's finances were tight, although his situation improved the following year.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of an STS-1, the frame is 810 <b>octets</b> in size, while the STM-1/STS-3c frame is 2,430 <b>octets</b> in size. For STS-1, the frame is {{transmitted}} as three <b>octets</b> of overhead, followed by 87 <b>octets</b> of payload. This is repeated nine times, until 810 <b>octets</b> have been transmitted, taking 125 µs. In {{the case of}} an STS-3c/STM-1, which operates three times faster than an STS-1, nine <b>octets</b> of overhead are transmitted, followed by 261 <b>octets</b> of payload. This is also repeated nine times until 2,430 <b>octets</b> have been transmitted, also taking 125 µs. For both SONET and SDH, this is often represented by displaying the frame graphically: as a block of 90 columns and nine rows for STS-1, and 270 columns and nine rows for STM1/STS-3c. This representation aligns all the overhead columns, so the overhead appears as a contiguous block, as does the payload.|$|E
