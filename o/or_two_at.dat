5|$|Lek {{systems are}} known to exist among some populations of walruses. These males cluster around females and try to attract them with {{elaborate}} courtship displays and vocalizations. Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, South American fur seals, New Zealand sea lions and harbor seals. In some species, including elephant seals and grey seals, males will try to lay claim to the desired females and defend them from rivals. Elephant seal males establish dominance hierarchies with the highest ranking males—the alpha males—maintaining harems {{of as many as}} 30–100 females. These males commonly disrupt the copulations of their subordinates while they themselves can mount without inference. They will, however, break off mating to chase off a rival. Grey seal males usually claim a location among a cluster of females whose members may change over time. Male harp seals, crabeater seals and hooded seals follow and defend lactating females in their vicinity—usually one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>at</b> a time,—and wait for them to reach estrus.|$|E
5|$|On October21, a westward-moving {{tropical}} wave {{entered the}} Caribbean. The wave quickly developed organized convection, indicating that a possible low-pressure area had developed along the wave. Continued development {{led to the}} formation of Tropical Depression Twenty-Five (which would later be named Alpha). The wave continued to move towards the west, producing minimal shower and thunderstorm activity. Once in the southwestern Caribbean, the wave slowed, and convection gradually redeveloped on October25. The next day, with continued organization, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated that a tropical depression could develop in the following day <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> <b>At</b> around 18:00UTC, the NHC determined that Tropical Depression Twenty-Six had developed about 105miles (170km) north of the central cost of Panama.|$|E

25|$|While {{ancestor}} veneration is {{an ancient}} part of Filipino culture, the modern observance {{is believed to have}} been imported from Mexico when the islands (as part of the Spanish East Indies) were governed from Mexico City as part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain.

Entire families spend a night <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>at</b> their loved ones' tombs, passing time with card games, eating, drinking, singing and dancing. Prayers such as the rosary are often said for the deceased, who are normally offered candles, flowers, food, and even liquor. Some Catholic Chinese Filipino families additionally offer joss sticks to the dead, and observe customs otherwise associated with the Hungry Ghost Festival.|$|E

25|$|But Busch {{nevertheless}} saw the company's {{purchase of}} the Cardinals as a shrewd business move. It would first increase A–B's sales through the captive market {{of as many as}} 30,000 spectators, many of whom would buy a beer <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> <b>at</b> Sportsman's Park on summer afternoons. Indirectly it would also help the company by disadvantaging one local competitor, Griesedieck Brothers, who had long sponsored the team's radio and television broadcasts, leading one of their brands, Falstaff, to outsell A–B's flagship Budweiser in the city of St. Louis itself, which greatly consterned Busch. At the national level, preventing the Cardinals from moving to Milwaukee would also prevent Schlitz and Pabst, the company's two main competitors at that time, from capitalizing on having a local major-league team to use as a promotional platform and similar captive market for beer sales at games. Lastly, it would be favorable for the company's image to have kept the team in St. Louis.|$|E
25|$|The Nicholsons {{were a very}} numerous, {{though not}} a {{powerful}} family, who in the 16th century lived in the Reddish district. Their names occur frequently in the early Parish Registers which were first begun in 1584. Their main home was Wood Hall, Sandy Lane. The family originated in Cumberland (Cumbria) and, after a century <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>at</b> Reddish, the main branch moved on to become landowners in Essex, but left behind numerous relatives. William Nicholson, born probably in 1561 was a former Master of the School. He attend Caius College, Cambridge in June 1581, then changed to Jesus College, where he took his B.A. in 1585 and M.A. in 1588. No-one can say when he was appointed Master of Stockport Grammar School because {{the records of the}} Goldsmiths’ Company are missing from 1579 to 1592, but {{it is likely to be}} 1587, after the death of Francis Low. He died in office and was buried at Stockport in September 1597.|$|E
25|$|Schooling came to her, {{as it was}} apt {{to come to a}} girl of her period, {{intermittently}} and in variety. She spent a year in a small {{boarding school}} in Plattsburg; an interval at a school kept at the Shurtliff homestead in Middlebury; attendance at the Middlebury Female Semimary; a winter at a village Academy in Rutland, where she recited Latin with boys preparing to enter college as sophomores; and a term <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>at</b> “Old T. C. A.” It was at Middlebury, in a one-story school house on Pleasant Street ,that she began the study of Latin, the subject of all others most useful in her adult life, as she declared. There, too, under Father Merrill, she wrote on the blackboard the list of English kings from Julius Caesar to William the Fourth, without a blunder. The feat was recalled by President John M. Thomas when in 1910 he conferred on her the degree of Doctor of Letters from Middlebury College, an honor which with characteristic modesty she accepted as a tribute to the women of her generation.|$|E

[...] The pygmy hippopotamus, named Totota, arrived in Brooklyn, New York, on February 4, 1960, and traveled via station wagon to Washington the next day, where he would continue Billy's breeding legacy with the zoo's female pygmy hippos, two of which were Billy's daughters.|$|E
500|$|The puffadder shyshark is oviparous; {{there is}} no {{distinct}} breeding season and reproduction occurs year-round. Females deposit egg capsules one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>at</b> a time, attaching them to vertical structures such as sea fans. The thin-walled egg cases are brown with distinctive pale transverse bands; and have a slightly furry texture and long adhesive tendrils at the corners. They are smaller than those of other shyshark species, measuring [...] long and [...] across. The young shark hatches after three months, and measures around [...] long. The length at maturation for both sexes has been reported as anywhere from [...] by various sources; this high degree of variation may reflect regional differences as sharks from deeper waters {{in the eastern part}} of its range seem to mature at a larger size than those from the west. The age at maturation is estimated to be around 7 years, and the maximum lifespan is at least 22 years.|$|E

500|$|On January 7, 2008, Rise Against {{announced}} on their website {{that they had}} begun writing and demoing for their next album.

He also stated that the album would be recorded at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado and produced by Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore, who had produced The Sufferer & the Witness. Also in May 2008, Rise Against posted a blog on their website, stating that they were back in the studio working on the album. It explained that they had [...] "spent many weeks in Chicago throughout the end of winter writing new songs" [...] in their [...] "rehearsal space". Asked later about the writing and recording process, McIlrath said, [...] "We kind of blocked a month off over the winter and said, 'Let's all get together, get the rehearsal space, and start putting some ideas together,' which is what we did.

500|$|The reliquary exuberantly {{exploits}} the ronde bosse or [...] "encrusted" [...] enamelling technique, {{which involves}} creating small three-dimensional figures coated in enamel {{on a metal}} core, often just gold wire. [...] The technique was a recent innovation which the goldsmiths working for the Valois were pushing to its limits {{at the end of}} the 14th century. [...] The main colour of enamel used is a lead-based white, which had also only been developed a decade <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>at</b> most before the date of the reliquary, and was evidently very fashionable {{at the end of the}} century. [...] White dominates the few surviving large enamels in ronde bosse dated to the period beginning about 1380 and ending about 1410, used as here for both the clothes and flesh of the figures. [...] Gold is used for their hair, and other enamel colours are mostly used at the neck and cuffs to demarcate between white robes and white flesh; [...] "throughout, colour is used in a very considered way"; [...] "a controlled use of red includes the alternation of rubies and pearls", except where [...] "a single sapphire interrupts this rhythm" [...] above God the Father. [...] Blue, an important enamel colour in other works, is almost entirely absent here, perhaps so as not to overshadow the large sapphires.|$|E

500|$|Females perform most of {{the care}} of eggs and nestlings, though males take a minor share of {{incubation}} and brooding. The clutch consists of three to four dull white eggs of a tapered oval shape measuring [...] and with red-brown blotches that are often heavier around the larger end of the egg. The female incubates the eggs for 30days and when the eggs hatch the chicks are helpless but have soft down covering their body. For {{the first two weeks}} or so the female broods the chicks constantly, both day and night. The female does no hunting at all for the first three weeks after hatching, but calls to the male from the nest, and he generally responds by bringing food. The female feeds the chicks with the mice brought back to the nest by the male, feeding them in tiny pieces for the first week <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> <b>at</b> which time the chicks are capable of swallowing a mouse whole. The nestling period lasts around 36days, and the post-fledging period at least 36days with parental feeding for at least 22days. When the chicks are older both parents take it in turns to feed them. Black feathers start to appear along the chicks' wings when they are about a fortnight old, and they are fully fledged and are ready to fly in five weeks. Within a week of leaving the nest the young birds are capable of hunting for mice on their own.|$|E
