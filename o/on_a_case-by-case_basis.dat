5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at {{lower risk of}} heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>case-by-case</b> <b>basis,</b> while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease.|$|E

40|$|The {{scarcity}} of women among the highly qualified professionals in business-to-business {{information and communication}} technologies (ICT), either in Europe andor in North America, has been noted as recently as the late 1990 ’s (Panteli, Stack, Atkinson, & Ramsay, 1999). The organization and management of work in such organizations firms is typically project-based. This has many consequences, including: long working hours with fierce resistance to shorter hoursany reduction, unpaid overtime, high management expectations of employee flexibility to meet unanticipated client demands, and the need for employees to negotiate flexible work arrangements <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>case-by-cases</b> <b>basis</b> with <b>a</b> project manager who often has much discretion on whether to accommodate such requests. We found that women are particularly disadvantaged in such a system, which could partly explain their under-representation in such jobs...|$|R
5|$|Foreign states {{generally}} enjoy {{immunity from}} lawsuits in the United States under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). The FSIA is the exclusive basis for U.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction over a foreign government. Prior to {{enactment of the}} FSIA in 1976, the executive branch was responsible for determining the immunity of foreign states <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>case-by-case</b> <b>basis.</b> By enacting the FSIA, Congress codified the guidelines for the immunity of foreign states and transferred responsibility for determining a foreign state's immunity from the executive branch to the judiciary.|$|E
5|$|Forward Intelligence Teams (FITs) are two or {{more police}} {{officers}} who are deployed by UK police forces to gather intelligence {{on the ground and}} in some circumstances, to disrupt activists and deter anti-social behaviour. They use cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. An unsuccessful legal challenge has been made against their use of overt surveillance, but in 2009 the Court of Appeal ruled that they must justify retention of photographs <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>case-by-case</b> <b>basis.</b> Any retained information is recorded on the Crimint database.|$|E
5|$|On March 6, 2014, the FCC {{announced}} that it would hold a vote on March 31 on a proposal to ban joint sales agreements involving television stations outright, making them attributable to FCC ownership limits if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time of a competing junior partner station in the JSA; the ban applies to both existing sharing agreements under such a structure as well as pending station transactions that include a JSA. Station owners would be given a two-year grace period to unwind or modify joint sales agreements in violation of the policy; coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market would also be barred under the proposal. Wheeler also proposed an expedited process to review joint sales agreements <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>case-by-case</b> <b>basis,</b> granting a waiver of the rules if a broadcaster can prove a particular joint sales agreement arrangement serves the public interest.|$|E

The European Commission is proposing one, common EU list designating as 'safe' all EU candidate countries (Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey), plus potential EU candidates Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo.

5|$|On {{the same}} day Mack Brown {{announced}} his acceptance of the Texas head coaching position, seven North Carolina football players allegedly assaulted a North Carolina student, severely injuring him. All seven were charged with offenses ranging from misdemeanor assault to simple assault. Among the players charged were defensive leader and All-American linebacker Kivuusama Mays and two other starters on North Carolina's defense. At the time, UNC policy dictated the immediate suspension of any player charged with a felony, and punishment for lesser charges to be decided <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>case-by-case</b> <b>basis.</b> After investigating the incident, North Carolina school officials cleared six of the seven accused players {{to participate in the}} Gator Bowl with judicial charges still pending. The seventh accused player, backup defensive tackle Ricco McCain, was suspended indefinitely from the team while legal action proceeded.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team had}} access to Codemasters' full audio library, which was composed of sound assets dating from the first Colin McRae Rally (1998) up to Grid 2 (2013). <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>case-by-case</b> <b>basis,</b> they decided whether to reuse existing sounds or update them. The result {{was a combination of}} audio from various games; suspensions sounds were taken from Dirt 3, wind, gearbox and mechanical samples from Colin McRae Rally 2005, garage sounds from , and music from Colin McRae Rally 04. One aspect of the audio that was kept intact was the original pacenotes read by professional co-driver Nicky Grist. The team did not want to disrupt the timing and delivery of critical track information so they opted to use the original recordings in this case. Support for custom soundtracks was added so that players could listen to their own music in-game.|$|E

5000|$|White {{began by}} noting that the {{doctrine}} allowing multiple litigation <b>on</b> <b>a</b> patent held invalid had been criticized, yet both parties' patent lawyers in this case were unwilling to ask for Triplett to be overruled. White quoted Blonder-Tongue's counsel as saying, [...] "Though petitioners stand to gain by any such result, we cannot urge {{the destruction of a}} long-accepted safeguard for patentees merely for the expediency of victory." [...] The Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division, however, arguing for the Government as amicus curiae, urged the Court to overrule Triplett partially—to permit or preclude relitigating patents <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>case-by-case</b> fact-specific <b>basis.</b>|$|R

50|$|Before {{doing the}} procedure, {{scientists}} must carefully calculate exactly {{what needs to}} be done, and treat each patient <b>on</b> <b>an</b> individual <b>case-by-case</b> <b>basis.</b> To do this, imaging technology such as CT scans and MRI’s are commonly used to create a 3D image of the tumor. From this information, they can approximate the volume of the tumor and decide on the best course of action including the insertion site of electrodes, the angle they are inserted in, the voltage needed, and more, using software technology. Often, a CT machine will be used to help with the placement of electrodes during the procedure, particularly when the electrodes are being used to treat tumors in the brain.|$|R

40|$|In {{a recent}} meta-analysis, {{surfactant}} administration in paediatric acute respiratory failure {{was associated with}} improved oxygenation, reduced mortality, increased ventilator-free days and reduced duration of ventilation. Surfactant is expensive, however, and its use involves installation of large volumes into the lungs, resulting in transient hypoxia and hypotension in some patients. Many questions also remain unanswered, such the as optimum dosage and the timing of administration of surfactant. The merits of surfactant administration should therefore still be decided <b>on</b> <b>an</b> individual <b>case-by-case</b> <b>basis.</b> Duffett and colleagues performed a meta-analysis of the six published randomised trials of surfactant therapy in intubated and ventilated children with acute respiratory failure [1].

5000|$|The Court had tolerated anticipatory overruling in {{the wake}} of Brown v. Board of Education {{and at the end of}} the Lochner era, Bradford observed. This had broad social benefits: Without anticipatory overruling, legal {{progress}} is segmented. The law lurches forward first in one limited area and then in another, as the Supreme Court slowly changes its rules <b>on</b> <b>a</b> narrow, <b>case-by-case</b> <b>basis.</b> Policies that the Supreme Court no longer approves remain frozen in time. Obsolete, disapproved rulings continue to control peoples behavior until a case presenting that precise issue again works its way to the Supreme Court.

The transition is smoother and the benefits of new federal policies become available to the public more quickly.|$|R
