In addition, sulfuric acid concentration only contributes a small fraction (< 15 %) to the total observed growth rate.

40|$|International audienceA {{modelling}} study {{investigating the}} formation of organic particles from inorganic, thermodynamically stable clusters was carried out. A recently-developed theory, the so-called nano-Köhler theory, which describes a thermodynamic equilibrium between a nanometer-size cluster, water and water-soluble organic compound, was implemented in a dynamical model along with a treatment of the appropriate aerosol and gas-phase processes. The obtained results suggest that both gaseous sulphuric acid and <b>organic</b> <b>vapours</b> contribute to <b>organic</b> particle formation. The initial growth of freshly-nucleated clusters having a diameter around 1 nm is driven by condensation of gaseous sulphuric acid and by a lesser extent cluster self-coagulation. After the clusters have reached sizes of around 2 nm in diameter, low-volatile <b>organic</b> <b>vapours</b> start to condense spontaneously into the clusters, thereby accelerating their growth to detectable sizes. A shortage of gaseous sulphuric acid or <b>organic</b> <b>vapours</b> limit, or suppress altogether, the particle formation, since freshly-nucleated clusters are rapidly coagulated away by pre-existing particles.

40|$|There is a {{necessity}} for portable and relatively cheap device {{which could be used}} for rapid, reversible and in-situ volatile organic compound detection. We offer a polyisoprene-nanostructured carbon composite (PNCC) us a promising material for <b>organic</b> solvents <b>vapour</b> detection and identification in the environment. Previously obtained experimental results verify that PNCC can distinguish 10 different <b>organic</b> solvents saturated <b>vapour.</b> When PNCC is exposed to <b>organic</b> solvents <b>vapour,</b> molecules of vapour adsorbe {{on the surface of the}} composite and diffuse into matrix material. At the same time decreases the tunnelling currents between carbon aggregates in thin layers of matrix and the electrical resistance of the composite increases. In the presence of <b>organic</b> solvents <b>vapour</b> electric resistance changes remarkably in short time (30 s) and the effect is reversible. The largest electric resistance change velocity (vR) is observed for tetrahydrofuran (0, 19404 KΩ/min), benzene (0, 13082 KΩ/min) and ethylacetate (0, 10694 KΩ/min) vapour. But nearly no vR change is observed, when PNCC is exposed to propanol vapour (0, 004028 KΩ/min). We relate this variant electric resistance response of PNCC to <b>organic</b> solvents <b>vapour</b> variant compatibility with the composites matrix material (polyisoprene) and variant <b>organic</b> solvents <b>vapour</b> molecule dimensions. To evaluate vapour compatibility with the composite matrix material we compared dielectric permeability values of vapour (εv) and polyisoprene (εp).

Results of the <b>organic</b> <b>vapours</b> adsorption show that the polarity of adsorbate is very important factor. It was found that adsorption of less polar and nonpolar <b>organic</b> <b>vapours</b> on the prepared clay-based materials took place through weak interactions and the specific surface area was key factor influencing adsorption process. Influence of water content in the materials can be considered, too. Adsorbed amounts of weakly polar organics on the clay materials were at most on the half level in comparison with active carbon. In the case of polar acetone the studied bentonites show the comparable adsorbed amounts as active carbon. It was found that acetone replaced water molecules in the solvation shells of interlayer cations, which was proven by infrared spectroscopy. The specific surface area did not play a leading role during adsorption of acetone on the bentonites. Web of Science 71112...|$|R

40|$|An aerosol {{dynamics}} model, AEROFOR 2, {{is developed}} {{in the context of}} the BIOFOR project focussing on boreal forest aerosol. It is the second version of a Lagrangian type box model AEROFOR for investigating the formation and growth of particles under clear sky atmospheric conditions. Particles can consist of soluble and insoluble material and the particle population can be externally or internally mixed. AEROFOR 2 includes gas phase chemistry and aerosol dynamics, and calculates the number and composition distributions of particles as functions of time. Observed growth rates of the nucleation mode particles after a typical nucleation event are 2 – 3 nm/h. The model simulations predict that 3 Ω 107 molecules cm− 3 of insoluble <b>organic</b> <b>vapour</b> and less than 6 Ω 106 molecules cm− 3 of soluble vapour condensing onto particles are enough to make them grow in good agreement with the observed growth rates. Then the source rate of the <b>organic</b> <b>vapour</b> must be an order of 105 molecules cm− 3 s− 1, and its saturation vapour density should be below 106 molecules cm− 3. If the aerosol was initially an internal mixture of soluble (70 %) and insoluble (30 %) constituents it transformed to an externally mixed aerosol during the simulation. By applying the externally-mixed aerosol based on measured soluble volume fractions, it was concluded that the modelled soluble fraction of the nucleation mode was too low in comparison with the measurements, and thus, a part of the condensable <b>organic</b> <b>vapour</b> must be water soluble. 1.

40|$|Until {{recently}} secondary {{organic carbon}} (SOC) aerosol mass concentrations have been systematically underestimated by three-dimensional atmospheric-chemistry-aerosol models. With a newly proposed concept of aging of organic vapours more realistic model results for organic carbon aerosol mass concentrations could be achieved. Applying a mixed thermodynamic-kinetic approach for SOC aerosol formation shifted the aerosol size distribution towards {{particles in the}} cloud condensation nuclei size range, thereby emphasising the importance of SOC aerosol formation schemes for modelling realistic cloud and precipitation formation. The additional importance of hetero-molecular nucleation between H 2 SO 4 and organic vapours remains to be evaluated in three-dimensional atmospheric-chemistry-aerosol models. Here a case study is presented focusing on Puy-de-Dôme, France in June 2010. Even though nucleation events at Puy-de-Dôme were rare during the chosen period of investigation a weak event in the boundary layer could be reproduced by the model when nucleation of low-volatile secondary <b>organic</b> <b>vapour</b> is included. Differences in the model results with and without nucleation of <b>organic</b> <b>vapour</b> are visible in the lower free troposphere over several days of the period.
