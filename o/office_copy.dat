6000|$|For just at this {{juncture}} something occurred calculated to divert not only Mr. Furlong's sentence, but the fortunes and the surplus of St. Asaph's itself. At the very moment when Mr. Furlong was speaking a newspaper delivery man in the street outside handed to the sanctified boy the <b>office</b> <b>copy</b> of the noonday paper. And the boy had no sooner looked at its headlines than he said, [...] "How dreadful!" [...] Being sanctified, he had no stronger form of speech than that. But he handed the paper forthwith {{to one of the}} stenographers with hair like the daffodils of Sheba, and when she looked at it she exclaimed, [...] "How awful!" [...] And she knocked at once {{at the door of the}} ancient clerk and gave the paper to him; and when he looked at it and saw the headline the ancient clerk murmured, [...] "Ah!" [...] in the gentle tone in which very old people greet the news of catastrophe or sudden death.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Mountjoy, I {{have come}} to you with a message from your aunt." [...] This was said, {{three or four days}} after the {{conversation}} between Florence and her mother, by Mr. Anderson, who had contrived to follow the young lady into a small drawing-room after luncheon. What was the nature of the message it is not necessary for us to know. We may be sure that it had been manufactured by Mr. Anderson for the occasion. He had looked about and spied, and had discovered that Miss Mountjoy was alone in the little room. And in thus spying we consider him to have been perfectly justified. His business at the moment was that of making love, a business which is allowed to override all other considerations. Even the making an <b>office</b> <b>copy</b> of a report made by Mr. Blow for the signature of Sir Magnus might, according to our view of life, have been properly laid aside for such a purpose. When a young man has it in him to make love to a young lady, and is earnest in his intention, no duty, however paramount, should be held as a restraint. Such was Mr. Anderson's intention at the present moment; and therefore we think that he was justified in concocting a message from Lady Mountjoy. The business of love-making warrants any concoction to which the lover may resort. [...] "But oh, Miss Mountjoy, I am so glad to have a moment in which I can find you alone!" [...] It must be understood that the amorous young gentleman had not yet been acquainted with the young lady for quite a fortnight.|$|E

5000|$|By Aehrenthal's account {{given by}} Albertini, Izvolsky agreed that Russia would {{maintain}} [...] "a friendly and benevolent attitude" [...] if Austria-Hungary were to annex Bosnia-Herzegovina. Reciprocally, should Russia move to open [...] "the Straits to single ships of war", Austria-Hungary would maintain a benevolent attitude. The two agreed that a likely {{consequence of the}} annexation was that Bulgaria, which was de facto independent since 1878, would declare its formal independence from the Ottoman Empire. Austria-Hungary would offer no territorial concessions to Serbia or Montenegro, but if they supported the annexation then Austria-Hungary would not oppose Serbian expansion in the Balkans, and would support the Russian demand to revise Article 29 of the Treaty of Berlin which restricted Montenegrin sovereignty. The parties agreed that [...] "these changes could receive sanction after negotiation with the Porte and the Powers", but [...] "there {{would be no more}} talk of Bosnia-Herzegovina".

It was notable for its {{colorful}} psychedelic graphics and its eclectic, non-doctrinaire radical politics, {{and was a member}} of the Underground Press Syndicate. It was a real DIY operation: in the Seed <b>office</b> <b>copy</b> was set on an IBM Selectric and pasted up, negatives were made and stripped up for plate-making, and inks were mixed to take to the printer. The Seed, along with the San Francisco Oracle, was one of the first tabloid newspapers to use [...] "split fount" [...] inking on a web press. At its peak it circulated between 30 and 40,000 copies, with national distribution. Important events covered by Seed writers and artists were the trial of the Chicago Eight, Woodstock, and the murder of Fred Hampton. After losing its original printer in 1968 it was printed for a time on the presses of liberal Wisconsin newspaper publisher Bill Schanen, who provided printing services for a large number of Midwestern underground papers that could find no other printer.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, {{retiring}} from competing in U.S. and Canadian national freestyle, disc golf and over-all competitions, Westerfield continued {{to organize and}} produce local disc events in Toronto. In 1979, because of his love of ultimate, began organizing ultimate events {{and with the help}} of Irwin Toy's Bob Blakely and Chris Lowcock, created the Toronto Ultimate League. Westerfield started weekly ultimate pick-up games on Kew Beach, then sent team invitations to Wards Island, West Toronto, North Toronto and his own team Beaches. These were the first four teams with each team taking turns hosting Wednesdays weekly league game nights at their home locations. The league starting night was at Kew Beach. Westerfield, using Bob Blakely's <b>office</b> <b>copy</b> machine and mailing facility at Irwin Toy, would produce a weekly newsletter highlighting the games and scores for each team as well as their league standings through the playing season. The Toronto Ultimate League developed and was renamed the Toronto Ultimate Club (TUC), that now has 3300 active members and over 250 teams playing the year round. This was the first ultimate league in Canada and now one of the world's oldest.|$|E
5000|$|I {{may as well}} {{describe}} the book. I called it simply The Canadian Army, 1939-1945. It amounted to just over 350 printed pages, with a dozen illustrations in colour (reproductions of pictures by our war artists), and numerous maps. In a preliminary work of this sort documentation seemed unnecessary, though I noted in the preface {{that in many cases}} [...] "the sources of quotations and statements made are identified in the text." ... Gerry Nicholson and Murray Hunter drafted portions of the text, Gerry {{the latter part of the}} story of the Italian Campaign and Murray part of that dealing with North-West Europe. As we carefully explained to the reader, the book was necessarily an interim report, [...] "a Summary, not a History." [...] My tattered old <b>office</b> <b>copy</b> of it is pockmarked with emendations, additions and corrections, particularly where statistics are concerned. Nevertheless, I think, the book has not worn too badly, and while the person who wants a precise account of the Canadian army in the Second World War should read the three-volume history which we produced later, the old Summary still affords a fairly satisfactory bird's-eye view of the struggle and the achievement.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 44 - 46) Global {{climate change}} {{is an issue of}} increasing public health concern, as levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases [GHG] continue to rise. Vector-born disease, air pollution, and heat-related deaths are projected to grow as global temperatures increase. Higher frequency and severity of weather events such as droughts, floods, and fires will threaten resources for fresh water, food and shelter. Although carbon dioxide (CO???) is the main GHG implicated for climate change, methane (CH???) is also a major GHG, 72 times more potent than CO??? over 20 years. As organic waste decomposes in landfills, the biogas produced is 50 % CO 2 and 50 % CH???. Landfills emit a significant amount of U. S. CH??? emissions. Recycling programs focus on diverting waste from landfills; however, recycling processes also emit GHGs. The USEPA's Waste Reduction Model (WARM) provides material-specific GHG emissions estimates that result from changes in waste management practices for 40 different waste materials. Healthcare is a sector that produces significant amounts of waste. Hospitals are under financial pressure, with few resources available to startup and staff solid waste recycling programs. Programs that have begun must prove to be a beneficial use of resources. The objectives of this research were to calculate rates of recycling and waste disposal at 5 hospitals in San Diego County, to quantify net GHG emissions from current waste management efforts, and to identify healthcare waste streams with the greatest opportunity for GHG emissions reductions, through waste minimization and/or source reduction. Average recycling rate (RR) for San Diego County hospitals was 25. 7 %. Using WARM, net GHG emissions (alt-base) for San Diego County hospitals waste management activities were estimated to be 3, 778. 38 metric tons (MT) carbon dioxide equivalents (CO 2 Eq) per year. Waste streams with greatest opportunity for GHG emissions reductions were "Office Paper" and "Computers. " It was found that if San Diego County hospitals reduced <b>office</b> (<b>copy)</b> paper usage by 50 % and extended the working life of computers for one year (without recycling or replacing), net GHG emissions (as compared to a baseline recycling scenario) would be (- 18, 802. 39) MTCO 2 Eq. A 50 % reduction in Office Paper usage alone would result in 8. 96 lbs less CO??? emissions per staffed bed per day. This study's results illustrate that maximum potential GHG emissions savings was achieved through a combination of adjustments to waste management practices: a simple recipe of recycling, waste minimization and source reduction. More specifically, an average hospital can reduce GHG emissions by over 1, 000 MT CO???Eq per year by establishing (1) a baseline recycling program of at least 25 %, (2) waste minimization of 10 - 20 %, (3) source reduction of <b>office</b> (<b>copy)</b> paper by 50 %, and (4) extending the life of computers by one year...|$|E
40|$|Standard {{factorial}} designs (one array) offer {{a cost-effective}} and information-efficient robust design alternative to parameter designs (two-array) made popular by Taguchi. This paper compares these two methods (one-array versus two-array) in depth via an industrial case study. It then discusses advanced tools for robust design that involve application of response surface methods (RSM) and measurement of propagation of error (POE). PARAMETER DESIGN ADVOCATED BY TAGUCHI (TWO-ARRAY) In the early 1980 ’s, {{the methods of}} Genichi Taguchi became popular {{as a tool for}} quality improvement, especially in the automotive industry. Taguchi provided a focus on robust design that reached fruition in the Six Sigma movement. The basic philosophy of robust design is that it’s desirable to develop processes that consistently produce product to target with minimal variation. To achieve this objective, Taguchi advised that input variables be divided into two categories: 1. Control factors, for example the adjustments a technician makes to your office copier. 2. Noise factors, for example the humidity that fluctuates in your office environment. Ideally, processes will be adjusted via the control factors to be insensitive to the noise factors, whose variation presumably cannot be eliminated. For example, the <b>office</b> <b>copy</b> machine should handle paper properly during humid summer months {{as well as in the}} winter, when conditions are dry and prone to static electricity.

40|$|This handbook, now {{available}} in paperback, brings together a comprehensive collection of mathematical material in one location. It also {{offers a variety of}} new results interpreted in a form that is particularly useful to engineers, scientists, and applied mathematicians. The handbook is not specific to fixed research areas, but rather it has a generic flavor that can be applied by anyone working with probabilistic and stochastic analysis and modeling. Classic results are presented in their final form without derivation or discussion, allowing for much material to be condensed into one volume. Concise compilation of disparate formulae saves time in searching different sources. Focused application has broad interest for many disciplines: engineers, computer scientists, statisticians, physicists; as well as for any researcher working in probabilistic and stochastic analysis and modeling in the natural or social sciences. The material is timeless, with intrinsic value to practicing engineers and scientists. Excerpts from reviews of the hardbound edition: This is a unique book and an invaluable reference for engineers and scientists in the fields of electrical engineering, mathematics and statistics. There is no other single reference book that covers Gaussian and Gaussian-related distributions of random variables that are encountered in research work and practice. This is a reference book that I recommend to all my graduate students working in the area of telecommunication system analysis and design. [...] John Proakis, Professor Emeritus, Northeastern University and Adjunct Professor, University of California, San Diego The reference book Probability Distributions Involving Gaussian Random Variables, authored by Dr. Marvin Simon, has become, {{in a very short time}} frame, one of the most useful aids to research in the field of digital communications that has come out in many years. It has numerous results that can save researchers in the field endless hours of work. It has replaced various other well known resources because of its concentration of relevant, timely, and easily accessible results.
