40|$|This paper reviews how {{working hours}} are asked in 26 {{large-scale}} surveys in 6 countries plus the European Union. Four dimensions of working time were investigated, notably number of working hours, timing of work, predictability {{and control over}} hours, and commuting time. Although almost all questionnaires ask for hours worked, the terminology varies largely. In {{only half of the}} cases a reference period is taken into account and in half the reasons for working more/less in the survey week than usual are asked. Contractual hours are hardly asked and so are paid and unpaid overtime hours. The timing of work is asked in a minority of the questionnaires, and predictability and control over working hours is also not a major issue. The incidence of an <b>on-call</b> <b>contract</b> is the most likely proxy for predictability. ...|$|E

Temporary work was associated with fewer task demands and lower autonomy and was more often passive or high-strain work, while permanent work was more often active work.

40|$|In {{the last}} 25 years {{the number of}} {{flexible}} jobs has been expanding in most European countries. For example, in the Netherlands in 1995, about 11 per cent of workers was working in a fixed-term temporary job and about 37 per cent of workers was working in a part-time job. Seven years later, in 2002 these percentages had increased to 14 per cent and 44 per cent. It should be noted however, {{that the increase in}} temporary jobs already reached 13 per cent in 1998 and is fairly stable since, whereas the percentage of part-time jobs is still increasing in 2002. For the purpose of this paper, the focus will be on several forms of contractual flexibilisation: temporary contracts, small part-time <b>contracts,</b> <b>on-call</b> and replacement <b>contracts,</b> casual and seasonal work and work with temporary work agencies. These jobs are all defined as non-standard employment. The labour market in the Netherlands is characterised by quite some mobility between the various labour market states. The high mobility rates between non-standard and standard jobs, except for the small jobs and <b>on-call</b> <b>contracts</b> as part of non-standard employment, provide arguments for defending the hypothesis that the Dutch labour market is not characterised by a clear-cut segmentation of non-standard and standard jobs. An important finding {{is that there is a}} high degree of path dependence in labour market transitions. Earlier experience in standard employment increases the transition probabilities into standard employment, both for the nonemployed and for non-standard workers. Earlier experience in either non-standard or non-standard employment also reduces the probability of ‘falling back’ into nonemployment. Previous unemployment does not reduce the chances of finding a job for the nonemployed but does reduce the chances of finding a standard job for non-standard workers. ...|$|R

The second data source is the Supplement to the February 1995 Current Population Survey on Contingent and Alternative Work Arrangements. Exploiting the longitudinal component of the CPS, we compare the subsequent labor market status of individuals in flexible work arrangements and those in regular full-time positions in February 1995. We find that, except for independent contractors, workers in flexible staffing arrangements have less job stability than those in regular full-time arrangements in the sense that they are more likely to switch employers, become unemployed, or involuntarily drop out of the labor force within a year. However, the degree of job stability varies considerably across arrangements. We also show that the recent growth in certain types of flexible staffing arrangements could have translated into small declines in aggregate job stability and can account for a substantial share of the modest increase in job switching observed over the last decade. flexible, staffing, job, stability, Houseman, Polivka...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyse {{the use and}} {{compensation}} of fixed-term and <b>on-call</b> employment <b>contracts</b> in the Netherlands. I use an analytical framework in which wage differentials result from two types of uncertainty. Quantity uncertainty originates from imperfect foresight in future product demand. I argue that workers who take over part of the quantity uncertainty from the employer get higher payments. Quality uncertainty {{on the other hand}} originates from the fact that employers are ex-ante unable to fully observe a workers ability and results in lower wages. Using a combination of propensity score and Mahalanobis matching I analyse wage differentials and find that on-call workers receive compensation for providing quantity flexibility. Compensation of fixed-term contracts on the other hand is dominated by the negative wage effect of quality uncertainty. I investigate whether this relation still holds after the 1999 policy change that had a substantial impact on the attractiveness of on-call and fixed-term workers from the employers perspective. I find that the policy change has not only influenced the use of <b>on-call</b> and fixed-term <b>contracts,</b> but unintentionally also their compensation. temporary employment; wage differentials; uncertainty...|$|R

Using data from the Current Population Survey, we investigate the implications of the initial job-finding strategies pursued by the jobless for their short- and medium-term employment stability. At first sight, it appears that taking an offer of regular employment provides the greatest degree of employment continuity for the jobless. However, closer inspection indicates that the jobless who take up atypical employment are not only more likely to be employed 1 month and 1 year later than those who continue to search, but also to enjoy employment continuity that is not less favourable than that offered by regular, open-ended employment. ...|$|R

40|$|Shifting {{the burden}} for {{unemployment}} insurance: business cycles, business strategies, and the temporary staffing industry The advent of labor flexibility—regarded as {{a hallmark of}} the New Economy—was widely heralded during the nearly decade-long economic expansion of the 1990 s for helping U. S. firms achieve competitive advantages. In labor markets, flexibility has been achieved via the proliferation of contingent staffing arrangements such as independent <b>contracting,</b> <b>on-call</b> workers, and especially employment through temporary staffing agencies. The phenomenal growth of the temporary staffing industry (TSI) was one of the defining features of the 1990 s economic expansion, coming as it did {{on the heels of the}} 1980 s when the number of temporary staffing agencies operating in U. S. labor markets more than doubled. From 1982 to 1998, the number of jobs in the TSI rose a remarkable 577 percent, while the number of jobs in the overall economy increased by a robust, but in comparison still modest, 41 percent (GAO, 2000). By 2000, workers placed by temporary staffing agencies numbered more than 3. 6 million, or approximately 3 percent of the U. S. workforce. Recent research, furthermore, suggests that such point-in-time estimates greatly underestimate the flows of workers through the sector.

40|$|Efforts {{have been}} made to provide {{supplemental}} funding to emergency departments to offset the costs of uncompensated medical care. But a problem exists within the trauma system in Texas that has largely been overlooked by the state. This project will focus on the lack of funding available to physicians and <b>on-call</b> specialists who <b>contract</b> with hospitals to provide emergency care. ^ A lack of funding and reimbursement for emergency care is directly influencing the number of medical specialists willing to provide emergency treatment in hospitals on a contractual basis. A shortage of emergency physicians has an impact on the public health of all Texans who may need trauma care in a hospital. Specifically, a shortage of emergency physicians can lead to a complete denial of specialty emergency health care, a delay in patient treatment, and increased ambulance diversions. Quality and access barriers to emergency services undoubtedly threaten the stability of the trauma care system in Texas and the health status of its citizens. ^ In 2003, Texas took a significant step towards addressing the issue of uncompensated care provided by the trauma system and passed House Bill 3588, creating the Trauma Facilities and Emergency Medical Services Fund (“the Trauma Fund”). However, the primary shortfall to this legislation is that the Trauma Fund is only available to emergency medical service providers and hospitals. The Trauma Fund does little to help offset the cost incurred by <b>contracting</b> physicians and <b>on-call</b> specialists who provide emergency services to the uninsured. ^ This paper addresses how funding shortages for emergency department physicians negatively impact the trauma care system in Texas and the policy options available to create physician funding to offset the cost of uncompensated trauma care. Ultimately this paper concludes that although creating a new funding stream similar to the actions taken in other states would be a dramatic step towards addressing the problem, the political process in Texas may slow implementation of this option. Consequently, modifying existing legislation, although the weaker of the options, may be more attractive to those looking for immediate action. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{study of}} changes to working time {{is one of}} {{continuing}} importance in understanding how management innovates {{at the level of}} the labour process to secure reductions in labour costs. Competitive pressures through globalisation, for example, are creating a ‘precariat’ that faces curtailment of control over working time through, for example, <b>on-call,</b> zero hours <b>contracts</b> and increasing the time someone must put aside for labour without actually undertaking in it (Standing, 2011). Outsourcing and sub-contracting represent other key competitive features of the global economy. The focus of this paper is to explore how the growth of outsourcing and the subsequent power dynamics across inter-organisational relations between firms helps us understand the rationale and growth of management approaches to gain greater temporal flexibility and its impact on workers in supplier organisations. Context: Recent studies that have explored the impact of inter-organisational relations on employment have adopted a broad canvas placing changes to working time as part of a wider analysis of the employment effects of outsourcing. Here, purchasers within supply chains have been seen to increasingly determine the terms and conditions of workers in supplier organisations (Marchington, et al, 2005). This influence has been generally perceived to be detrimental as such relations have been linked to rising employment insecurity, downward pressure on pay and conditions, the undermining of worker voice and less-discretion-based work roles among employees in supplier organisations (Marchington et al, 2005 : Cunningham, 2008 : Newsome, 2010; Quinlan et al, 1999 and 2001). Such studies have also, with a few exceptions (see Marchington, et al, 2005), been focused on individual sectors, and offer limited comparative analysis across different spheres of economic activity. Within these debates the subject of changes to working time within supplier organisations has been touched on, but there are several related reasons to engage more fully with the dynamics of such change and its consequences within this context. The first relates to contemporary interest in the extent to which outsourcing, competition, marketization is leading to workers losing control over their working time, in order to meet the demands of external purchasers in a supply chain. Indeed, such debates are increasingly spilling into the realm of outsourced public service industries (Kessler and Bach, 2011) : leading to questions regarding to what extent are changes to working time and their effects on workers becoming common across private, public and voluntary spheres. The second concerns the issue of changes to working time being identified as key area of worker insecurity (Standing, 1991). Yet studies of the impact of insecurity in the workplace have largely focused on tenure, the impact of numerical flexibility and changes to skills (Heery and Salmon 2000). This is of some surprise given that working time is a health and safety issue regulated by EU regulations and concerns continue to be raised over how unsocial hours etc. matched with ‘lean’ working systems impact detrimentally on employee health and well-being. In this context, this paper seeks to explore the above themes by drawing from work from two independently conducted qualitative research programmes exploring the changing dynamics of employment relations and work organisation in the supply chains of retail services/food production and purchaser/provider relationships in social care. The studies interviewed representatives of purchasers in supplier chains and managers, employees and trade union representatives in supplier organisations. In doing so the paper addresses the following questions: What is the nature of purchaser – provider relations in the two sectors? What impact do power relations, competitive and cost pressures have on the organisation of working time in supplier organisations? What are the implications for workers in terms of their effort, commitment, health and well-being...|$|R
