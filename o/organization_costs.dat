40|$|How does an {{increase}} in <b>organization</b> <b>costs</b> (i. e. costs which arise when labor unions organize firm's workforces) affect the industry struc-ture, wage inequality and welfare? In the present paper, we build a model with costly and endogenous unionization, heterogeneous firms as well as free market entry/exit. In such a setting, we show that the share of low-productive firms operating in the market decreases (in-creases) in <b>organization</b> <b>costs</b> if those costs are relatively low (high). If more low-productive firms are active in the market, consumption and hence welfare decline because prices are, on average, higher (vice versa). As such, {{an increase}} in <b>organization</b> <b>costs</b> and thus a decline in unionization rates could be welfare-reducing. In addition, we find a hump-shaped relationship between <b>organization</b> <b>costs</b> and wage in-equality. These results suggest that a policy aiming to reduce union-ization by {{an increase in}} <b>organization</b> <b>costs</b> can but not necessarily have to be an improvement of the economic performance...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates how the {{trade-off}} between <b>organization</b> <b>costs,</b> transaction costs and economies of specialization {{may affect the}} way public goods are provided. In doing so, it considers two ways of providing a public good. One is collective provision where users organize themselves to jointly finance the public good which is produced by a specialized firm. The other is market provision with bundling where a firm produces the public good and a private good and sells them as a bundle. Both methods of public goods provision {{deal with the problem}} of non-excludability. The first method involves <b>organization</b> <b>costs,</b> but can take advantage of specialization economies; the second method avoids <b>organization</b> <b>costs,</b> but may incur some transaction costs and forgoes the benefit of specialization economies. Which method is superior depends on the relative magnitudes of <b>organization</b> <b>costs,</b> transaction costs, specialization economies as well as other features of the economy such as population size. public good, transaction costs, organisation costs, specialisation economies. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper applies Coase's (1937) {{theory of}} the firm to study public good provision. It compares three methods of public good provision: (1) {{collective}} provision, where users organize themselves to jointly finance the public good which is produced by a specialized firm; (2) market provision without outsourcing, where a firm produces the public good and a private good, and sells them as a bundle; (3) market provision with outsourcing, where a firm produces a private good, outsources the public good, and sell them as a bundle. All three methods of public goods provision {{deal with the problem}} of non-excludability, but each is associated with different transaction costs, <b>organization</b> <b>costs,</b> and specialization economies. The best method is the one which achieves the optimum tradeoffs among transaction costs, <b>organization</b> <b>costs,</b> and specialization economies.

40|$|Launching a {{real estate}} venture may entail {{start-up}} costs, <b>organization</b> <b>costs,</b> syndication costs, capital expenditures, and business expenses. Under the general rule, start-up costs are capitalized and not amortized (deducted). However, if the entity files the proper election, such costs may be amortized (straight-line) over 60 months or more. Only start-up costs paid or incurred before business begins are eligible for amortization. In general, costs are incurred when: 1. goods or services are received, and 2. there is an obligation to pay for them.

To do so, the suggestion is to consider network governance as an institutional combination of an authority structure and of interelationship mechanisms. The role of governance will be to maximize joint value and minimize <b>organization</b> <b>costs.</b> Such a perspective helps in the understanding of the very nature of networks, which can be seen as an optimization of a strategy/structure interplay.
