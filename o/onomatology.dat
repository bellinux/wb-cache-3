50|$|Celebrate Your Name Week (CYNW) is {{a holiday}} {{established}} in 1997 by American <b>onomatology</b> hobbyist Jerry Hill. Hill prescribed {{the first full}} week in March as a week for everyone worldwide to embrace and celebrate his or her name. It's also a week for appreciating names in general, and to have fun getting {{to know more about}} names. CYNW is a week set aside to participate in names-related hobbies, activities, and to take part in entertaining and enlightening names-related events. It's a week to develop and celebrate a true fondness for, and genuine appreciation of, names. There are seven components that comprise CYNW: Name Tag Day, Namesake Day, Name Fun Facts Day, Unique Names Day, Learn What Your Name Means Day, Middle Name Pride Day,and Genealogy Day.|$|E
5000|$|A {{peculiarity}} of the Arabic <b>onomatology</b> is the kunyah, the by-name {{given to}} a father {{after the birth of}} his son, by which he is named after the latter (Abou, Abo, or Abu followed by the name of his son). It may be added here that Abu al-Walid is a kunyah or by-name for Jonah. Abu also forms family names, {{as in the case of}} Abudarham, or Aboab. Here it has to be noted, that the word Abou was sometimes used in the sense of [...] "owner", especially when it was followed by an object that was of importance to the manner in which the surrounding community perceived the person in question. The most prominent example for this is Abou Hassira (owner of a straw mat), a descendant of a long line of kabbalists and pietists from Morocco (born 1807 in Morocco, died 1880 in Egypt, buried in the village of Demitiouh, near Damanhour, in the Governorate of Beheira), whose real name Yaccov Ben Massoud has almost been forgotten, as he has become identified as Rabbi Abou Hassira since his pilgrimage from his homeland to Jerusalem, during which the boat he was on sank, yet he was miraculously saved because he hung on to his straw mat (hassira), which had been his only possession. For this the Egyptian population venerated him from that day on as a holy man and miracle worker, whose life had been protected by the Lord through a frail mat.|$|E
40|$|The author {{subjects}} to criticism the modern Russian onomastical terms, which don’t {{meet the requirements}} of being monosemantic and systematic. To solve the problem of determining different phenomena the terms <b>onomatology</b> (onomatologia) as the study of personal names and onomastics as the whole continuum of personal names are proposed...|$|E

40|$|The author presentes {{here the}} {{specific}} character of Australian onoma­ stics from the semantic point of view. Australian <b>onomatology</b> {{is still a}} live process, a process in statu nascendi (excluding Aboriginal toponymies). The material analysed in the paper has been selected from various oncoastic works, indexes of topographic names, Australian Encyclopaedia and many maga­ zine articles. The paper presents the development of semantic types and gi­ves many examples of toponyms, sometimes hydronyms {{within the boundaries of}} a given state. There is a large portion of commemorative names after famous discoverers, explorers and travellers. Many names commemorate ruling royal families. Oth­ers originated from the names of governors and high-rank officials, names of national heroes, captains and officers of ships, secretaries of state, surgeons, bishops, first settlers and even fiction characters. Many names had been borrowed from places on other continents. Local names of apellative stems are not so numerously represented as the names discussed. There are also many Aboriginal names which are not etymologically clear. They are very often concurrent with European names. There are also a number of Anglo-Aboriginal hybrids. Zadanie pt.

40|$|ALTI {{linguistic}} multifunctional databases are {{the result}} of a project started in 1998 when the research interests of different Italian universities (Università degli Studi di Napoli L’Orientale, Università di Pisa, Università degli Studi di Salerno, Università degli Studi di Roma “Tor Vergata”, Università degli Studi di Perugia) came together in one research project of national interest under the coordination of prof. Domenico Silvestri of the Università degli Studi di Napoli L’Orientale. ALTI stands for Atlanti Linguistici Tematici Informatici (Electronic Thematic Linguistic Atlases), which represent a new typology with respect not only to traditional lexicography, but also to computational linguistics, since they put together the characteristics of traditional dictionaries and terminological collections with a conceptual map, which highlights the conceptual relation among terms. The word atlas is used to underline {{that it is not a}} simple dictionary but a collection of maps, organized as multimedia hyper-textual atlases which collect linguistic data belonging to specialized linguistic areas (such as <b>onomatology,</b> food-terminology, numerals, linguistic activities, metalanguage of linguistics, lexical-grammar) in a multilingual and interlinguistic perspective. The Atlases describe the phenomenology of specific language areas by linking definitions and usage as given in conventional dictionaries to specific cognitive categories which create conceptual networks, several sets of maps (one for each atlas) or cognitive ellipses. These conceptual networks allow to navigate and to explore the relations between concepts inside a specialized linguistic area. On the one hand, they are meta-dictionaries, since they refer to other dictionaries, lexical and terminological resources already available in traditional or electronic format, but they also add new information by following original research perspectives, and, on the other hand, they offer multimedia information such as graphs, photos, films which represent very useful tools for the users. The languages investigated are: ancient and modern Indo-European and non-Indo-European languages; ancient and modern Celtic languages; Latin and Italy's ancient languages; major modern languages. In conclusion the Atlases are an open work since it is always possible to modify and update them with new contents and so achieve rich virtual cognitive universes. In our contribution we will describe the main features of the project, the research methodologies, the structure of the Atlases and of the lexical entries, the results achieved until now and the future aims.
