5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have been shown to be useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E

5|$|There are variant glyph forms {{which contain}} minor {{alterations}} or additions. Dietrich posited that these variants represent the movement, position, {{and significance of}} astronomical bodies. A variant form might state whether a star is rising, culminating or setting; <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> is used for navigation or for calendrical/time-keeping purposes. In particular, doubling of a feature may refer to the culmination of an astronomical body in the sky.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph isomorphism problem, of finding whether a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a larger graph, can be solved in linear time when the larger graph has bounded book thickness. The {{same is true for}} detecting whether the pattern graph is an induced subgraph of the larger graph, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> has a graph homomorphism to the larger graph.

In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> is co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E

5|$|In 1820, rumors {{surfaced}} that Sharp had fathered a stillborn {{illegitimate child}} with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. Sharp denied the charge, and the immediate political effects were minimal. When {{the charges were}} repeated during Sharp's 1825 General Assembly campaign, opponents publicized the allegation {{that the child was}} a mulatto. Whether Sharp made such a claim, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was a rumor started by his political enemies, remains in doubt. Jereboam Beauchamp, who had married Cooke in 1824, avenged the honor of his wife by fatally stabbing Sharp at his home early on the morning of November 7, 1825. Sharp's murder inspired fictional works, most notably Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play Politian and Robert Penn Warren's novel World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E
5|$|M-type (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of {{the total}} population; their spectra {{resemble}} that of iron-nickel.

5|$|The white Schnauzer {{is one of}} four color {{varieties}} of the Miniature Schnauzer currently recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.

The controversy rests on the disputed origins of the white variation: whether it was contained within the genes of the originally recognized breed, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was the result of subsequent modifications. Since the other two Schnauzer types have never been available in a white variation, and the original German standard never included white as an acceptable color, the AMSC chooses not to recognize white.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 16thcentury, the town became an important trading port. The town took advantage of its east coast location, which facilitated trading contacts with the Low Countries, the Baltic region, England, and Northern France. The feu-ferme charter of 1451 between the Abbot of Dunfermline and the burgesses of Kirkcaldy mentioned a small but functioning harbour; it is not known when this harbour was established, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was always located {{at the mouth of the}} East Burn. According to treasurers' accounts of the early 16thcentury, timber imported via the harbour—possibly from the Baltic countries—was used at Falkland Palace and Edinburgh Castle, as well as in shipbuilding. Raw materials such as hides, wool, skins, herring, salmon, coal and salt were exported from the town until well into the 17thcentury.|$|E

5|$|Clyde Tombaugh's {{discovery}} of Pluto in 1930 appeared to validate Lowell's hypothesis, and Pluto was officially named the ninth planet. In 1978, Pluto was conclusively {{determined to be}} too small for its gravity to affect the giant planets, resulting in a brief search for a tenth planet. The search was largely abandoned in the early 1990s, when a study of measurements made by the Voyager 2 spacecraft found that the irregularities observed in Uranus's orbit were due to a slight overestimation of Neptune's mass. After 1992, the {{discovery of}} numerous small icy objects with similar or even wider orbits than Pluto led to a debate over whether Pluto should remain a planet, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> and its neighbours should, like the asteroids, be given their own separate classification. Although {{a number of the}} larger members of this group were initially described as planets, in 2006 the International Astronomical Union reclassified Pluto and its largest neighbours as dwarf planets, leaving Neptune the farthest known planet in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|During the Enlightenment and its {{debates about}} human origins, it became fashionable to {{speculate}} {{about the origin of}} language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led {{to the question of whether}} philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.|$|E
5|$|Evans and {{his agents}} set about aggressively {{collecting}} royalties from those using his designs. Furthermore, Evans significantly raised the license fees for {{his use of}} his patented technology, raising claims of extortion from those being asked to pay, and a great many cases ended up in court. The 1808 act had indemnified those who had adopted Evans's technologies from 1805 to 1808, but did not specify whether this indemnity was perpetual (as defendants argued) <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was only for the three years in question (as Evans argued). Evans by this stage of his life had also established a poor reputation for himself amongst the milling community, and his abrasive and often petty pursuit of patent rights stiffened resistance. Several major legal cases questioned whether laws to extend private patents in this manner were even constitutional, but Evans ultimately prevailed in each case.|$|E

5|$|In Lee Hsien Loong the appellants, {{which were}} in Hong Kong, {{challenged}} {{the jurisdiction of the}} High Court to hear a defamation suit brought by the respondents on the ground, among others, that the service of the writ should have been effected in accordance with the civil procedure convention set down in the Treaty of Judicial Assistance in Civil and Commercial Matters between the Republic of Singapore and the People's Republic of China. Thus, although this was not a judicial review case, the Court had to consider the justiciability of determining whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong, and whether the Court could depart from the views of the executive branch on the matter which were stated in a letter issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Court held that the present case did not involve the exercise of the sovereign or legislative prerogative in matters of high policy. Rather, it was concerned with the effect, and not the making, of the treaty <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was advisable. Thus, the letter from the Ministry was not an exercise of executive prerogative power, but merely a statement of opinion.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} if C.tuberosa is {{strictly}} parasitic, and needs the host to be living, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> is saprobic. Either way, the fruit bodies of the fungus are found growing solitarily or in dense clusters on the decomposing, often blackened remains of other mushrooms. Hosts include agarics (particularly Lactarius and Russula), boletes, hydnums, and polypores. In the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, Russula crassotunicata is a common and abundant species that has been definitively identified as a host of both C.tuberosa and Dendrocollybia racemosa. The Russula fruit bodies are slow to decay, and are available nearly year-round as a substrate for the saprobes. Based on field observations, the authors suggest that C.tuberosa may produce fruit bodies on less decayed mushrooms, while D.racemosa produces them on much more heavily decayed mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Most {{woolly mammoth}} populations {{disappeared}} {{during the late}} Pleistocene and early Holocene, alongside most of the Pleistocene megafauna (including the Columbian mammoth). This extinction formed part of the Quaternary extinction event, which began 40,000 years ago and peaked between 14,000 and 11,500 years ago. Scientists are divided over whether hunting or climate change, {{which led to the}} shrinkage of its habitat, was the main factor that contributed to the extinction of the woolly mammoth, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was due to a combination of the two. Whatever the cause, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates. Different woolly mammoth populations did not die out simultaneously across their range, but gradually became extinct over time. Most populations disappeared between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago. The last mainland population existed in the Kyttyk Peninsula of Siberia 9,650 years ago. A small population of woolly mammoths survived on St. Paul Island, Alaska, well into the Holocene with the most recently published date of extinction being 5,600 years B.P. The last known population remained on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4,000 years ago, well into the start of human civilization and concurrent with the construction of the Great Pyramid of ancient Egypt.|$|E
