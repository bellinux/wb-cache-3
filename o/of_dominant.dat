5|$|In 2007, {{researchers}} from Switzerland and the United States published a paper identifying the genetic cause <b>of</b> <b>dominant</b> white spotting in horses from the Franches Montagnes horse, Camarillo White Horse, Arabian horse and Thoroughbred breeds. Each of these dominant white conditions had occurred separately and spontaneously {{in the past}} 75 years, and each represents a different allele (variation or form) of the same gene. These same researchers identified a further seven unique causes <b>of</b> <b>dominant</b> white in 2009: three in distinct families of Thoroughbreds, one Icelandic horse, one Holsteiner, a large family of American Quarter Horses and a family of South German Draft horses.|$|E
5|$|W4 {{is found}} in Camarillo White Horses, a breed {{characterized}} by a white coat, beginning with a spontaneous white stallion born in 1912 named Sultan. Like W1 and W3, horses with this type <b>of</b> <b>dominant</b> white may be pure white or near-white, with pigmented areas along the topline that fade with time. This mutation is also an SNP (c.1805C>T), a missense mutation on Exon12.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} {{higher levels of}} {{androgen}} exposure, the female hyenas are significantly more muscular and aggressive than their male counterparts; social-wise, they are of higher rank than the males, being dominant or dominant and alpha, and the females who {{have been exposed to}} higher levels of androgen than average become higher-ranking than their female peers. Subordinate females lick the clitorises of higher-ranked females as a sign of submission and obedience, but females also lick each other's clitorises as a greeting or to strengthen social bonds; in contrast, while all males lick the clitorises <b>of</b> <b>dominant</b> females, the females will not lick the penises of males because males are considered to be of lowest rank.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{prior to}} modern DNA analysis developed remarkably prescient theories. The gene itself was first proposed and named W in 1948. In a 1969 work on horse coat colors, A los colores del caballo, Miguel Odriozola suggested that {{various forms of}} dominantly inherited white spotting might be arranged sequentially along one chromosome, thus allowing for the varied expression <b>of</b> <b>dominant</b> white. He also proposed that other, distant genes might also influence the amount of white present.|$|E
5|$|The K–Pg {{extinction}} had {{a profound}} effect on the evolution of life on Earth. The elimination <b>of</b> <b>dominant</b> Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to take their place, spurring a remarkable series of adaptive radiations in the Paleogene. The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals. After the K–Pg extinction, mammals evolved rapidly to fill the niches left vacant by the dinosaurs. Also significant, within the mammalian genera, new species were approximately 9.1% larger after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E

5|$|W5 {{is found}} in Thoroughbreds {{descending}} from Puchilingui, a 1984 stallion with sabino-like white spotting and roaning. Horses with the W5 allele exhibit a huge range in white phenotype: a few have been pure white or near-white, while others have sabino-like spotting limited to high, irregular stockings and blazes that covered the face. Twenty-two members of this family were studied, and the 12 with some degree <b>of</b> <b>dominant</b> white spotting {{were found to have}} a deletion in exon 15 (p.T732QfsX9), {{in the form of a}} frameshift mutation. A later study found that the members of this family with the greatest depigmentation were compound heterozygotes who also carried the W20 allele.|$|E
5|$|Daisy {{is another}} of Flower's daughters {{and the first to}} be {{impregnated}} by roving Lazuli male Carlos. When the Whiskers were temporarily split into two groups after a goshawk attack {{in the middle of the}} series, Daisy assumed the role <b>of</b> <b>dominant</b> female of the splinter group, but lost the role when her evicted sister Tosca found the group and took control. When the splinter group rejoined the main Whiskers, Flower discovered Daisy's pregnancy but allowed her to remain in the group. Daisy gave birth in an empty burrow, and after Yossarian found her, he helped to carry her newborn pups to the real burrow. The next day, Flower initiated a burrow move. In order to remain with her family, Daisy left the pups behind to die in the abandoned burrow.|$|E

5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence <b>of</b> <b>dominant</b> and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the {{gestation}} period tends to vary greatly, though 110 days is {{the average length of}} time. In the final stages of pregnancy, dominant females provide their developing offspring with higher androgen levels than lower-ranking mothers do. The higher androgen levels the result of high concentrations of ovarian androstenedione are thought to be responsible for the extreme masculinization of female behavior and morphology. This has the effect of rendering the cubs <b>of</b> <b>dominant</b> females more aggressive and sexually active than those of lower ranking hyenas; high ranking male cubs will attempt to mount females earlier than lower ranking males. The average litter consists of two cubs, with three occasionally being reported. Males take no part in the raising of young. Giving birth is difficult for female hyenas, as the females give birth through their narrow clitoris, and spotted hyena cubs are the largest carnivoran young relative to their mothers' weight. During parturition, the clitoris ruptures in order to facilitate the passage of the young, and may take weeks to heal.|$|E
5|$|Zaphod, {{named after}} Zaphod Beeblebrox from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, was Flower's devoted partner and the {{dominant}} male of the Whiskers. As Zaphod assumed both roles by usurping, {{he tended to}} be edgy if Yossarian got too close to Flower. According to the Meerkat Manor: The Series Begins film, Zaphod was a roving Lazuli male before he joined the Whiskers. He was really born in the Vivian, not the Lazuil. He and his younger brother, Yossarian, visited the Whiskers {{at the same time}} in search of females. Flower's sister Viale, then the dominant female, chose Yossarian as her mate and he became the group's dominant male. Zaphod and Flower also mated, but Viale killed the resulting pups. After Viale's death, Flower assumed the role <b>of</b> <b>dominant</b> female and showed preference to Zaphod for her mate. Yossarian then left the group for an unknown length of time.|$|E
40|$|During {{contests}} animals typically {{exchange information}} about fighting ability. Among feral horses these signals involve olfactory or acoustical elements and each type can effectively terminate contests before physical contact becomes necessary. Dung transplant experiments show that for stallions, irrespective of rank, olfactory signals such as dung sniffing encode information about familiarity suggesting that such signals {{can be used}} as signatures. As such they can provide indirect information about fighting ability as tong as opponents associate identity with past performance. Play-back experiments, however, show that vocalizations, uch as squeals, directly provide information about status regardless of stallion familiarity.
