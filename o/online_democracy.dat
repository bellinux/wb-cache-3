5000|$|In December 2009 and January 2010 Zombie Nation {{created a}} collectively orchestrated track, and Florian {{tells the story}} like so: [...] One cold day in December I had a brainwave. An idea for {{internet}} democratic music, made as a collaboration with my boys and girls on Facebook and Twitter. If you’re reading this you probably already {{know that it is}} my declared passion to mash samples together on my MPC, so the logical first step was to issue the callout: “send me your sounds!” In the week that followed, my dropbox was inundated with whistles, basses and burps.The next step was to split the sounds into categories and present them in 10 polls, and then open the voting up to the world. I created loops from the most popular sounds, and then opened them up to another popularity contest. The people spoke, once again, and chose their favourite five loops.In the following weeks, between sessions taking my beloved MPC all over the world, I worked out an arrangement. A song! Part of this work was done streaming video from the studio, with about three hundred people watching and contributing to the decision making process. After a final round of feedback on the arrangement through SoundCloud, the song was finalised. Tada!The last step was to make the parts available to the public, so anyone could have a bash and submit a remix. We selected the six most interesting and unique remixes, and included them in the package. Now only one thing was missing - a name! This was one element of the project that was beyond the capabilities of <b>online</b> <b>democracy.</b> The polling system hit its technical limits. So I decided to discuss the name with my new studio buddies, the people behind the original sounds submitted! And then at last, we had {{reached the end of the}} road.This project was not an attempt to make a logical song, a marketable piece of music, or even one that would appeal to most. Rather, the idea was to produce a democratic piece of music; one in which anyone could take part, and influence the outcome. And I am happy to say that it worked out great!. Florian Senfter The result was a track by [...] "Zombie Nation and Friends" [...] titled [...] "The Mind of Many". The sounds were by: 48oooooooooo, Certifiedsick, Coronium, D.L.I.D, Dastie, Drop The Lime, Flex Rock, Greg Shin, Hayashi, jhk, Jumping Jack Flash, Kim Moyes, L33ch, MAMM, Memorex, Nina Lou, Noize Generation, Pablo Decoder, Plastique de Reve, Brodinski, Prozac Polka, Randee Bugga, Shir Khan, Smashsnap, Solar Explosion, Springboard, Swam, Textbeak, The Model, Tocadisco, Uboot, uπit, Was, and Yibn. The artwork was sent by hannes at freieradikale.at and the song name “the mind of many” was proposed by Stephanie Nazywalskyj.

40|$|Democratic interfaces’ {{presents}} a design exploration into mobilizing {{the potential of}} the Internet for enabling newand more inclusive forms of democracy. Drawing on online deliberation research, the thesis argues that successful <b>online</b> <b>democracy</b> will need to facilitate open and informed discussion (deliberation) as a prerequisite for democratic decision-making. The potential for deliberative democracy on the Internetis explored through proposed user interface designs for online deliberation software:WebTing, a tool to facilitate democratic assemblies for online communities; and the citizensconstitution. org website, a campaign for a more inclusive constitutional process in the European Union. Further proposals are annotated as a pattern language and documented as they appear in the design process. The outcomes of this thesis work are relevant for the design and study of communtiy-enabling software, and in particular online deliberation and discussion software. Methods used are characteristic of interaction design, including information-gathering, sketching, prototypingand usability evaluation. Particular attention is paid to the challenges of designing community-enabling software, and to the normative influence of user interface design on user behaviour. These considerations suggest a need for new design methods independent of the HCI tradition, focused on user-to-user rather than user-to-system interaction, and on a prescriptive rather than reactive design practice...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{political}} parties have adopted Online Delegative Democracy platforms such as LiquidFeedback to organise themselves and their political agendas via a grassroots approach. A common objection {{against the use of}} these platforms is the delegation system, where a user can delegate his vote to another user, giving rise to so-called super-voters, i. e. powerful users who receive many delegations. It has been asserted in the past that the presence of these super-voters undermines the democratic process, and therefore delegative democracy should be avoided. In this paper, we look at the emergence of super-voters in the largest delegative <b>online</b> <b>democracy</b> platform worldwide, operated by Germany's Pirate Party. We investigate the distribution of power within the party systematically, study whether super-voters exist, and explore the influence they have on the outcome of votings conducted online. While we find that the theoretical power of super-voters is indeed high, we also observe that they use their power wisely. Super-voters do not fully act on their power to change the outcome of votes, but they vote in favour of proposals with the majority of voters in many cases thereby exhibiting a stabilising effect on the system. We use these findings to present a novel class of power indices that considers observed voting biases and gives significantly better predictions than state-of-the-art measures.

40|$|While the {{literature}} on adolescent usage of the Internet and mobile communication technology is burgeoning, the technological affordance of increased intergenerational contacts and intergenerational friendships received less attention. This project documents how intergenerational virtual networks operate in one particular massively multiplayer online game (World of Warcraft) {{from the standpoint of}} adolescent players. Online social worlds are similar to offline settings in a lot of ways. Users must obey certain behavioral standards and follow established rules and moral codes to participate. Despite accounts of <b>online</b> <b>democracy</b> and networked individualism, control and authority is central to the functioning of these environments. Power-relationships are structured by technological protocols and affordances. However, within the social space created by technology, participants actively create and re-create cultural customs shaping experience. Using the ethnographic methods of participant observation and semi-structured, open-ended interviews, this project documents the ways a different form of mature behavior, ematurity, is emerging in online spaces. Ematurity means that skilled adolescents with the right set of cultural toolkits and impression management techniques are able to participate as social equals in adult governed environments. The main foundation of emature habitus is social class. Ematurity allows young people to maintain desirable and acceptable social selves in adultist environments. While ematurity is redefining the currently narrow means of adult-youth interaction and friendship, it does not signal the end of childhood...|$|E
40|$|Amidst the {{commercial}} hype {{that has come}} to surround the internet in recent years, there has been much excitement about the democratic promise of the net and a growing wave of various e-democracy projects. It is thought that the ICTs and the world wide web in particular will enable more direct forms of citizen participation, especially at the local level, foster reciprocal interaction between citizens and decision-makers and create new spaces for public discussion and debate. Despite the claims of interactivity, the agenda for most <b>online</b> <b>democracy</b> projects has been set and their purposes of communication defined by institutionalized and powerful actors. The disparity between the rhetoric and the reality of web-assisted democracy is bound to persist unless the compartmentalized and hierarchic practices of public communication are challenged both theoretically and in practice. This article suggests that in order to tap the democratic potential of the web, we need to address the question of genre. As genres offer the cultural interfaces through which people make sense of and use the web, like other media, bottom-up alternatives to dominant online genres are needed in order to create more citizen-oriented spaces of public communication on the web. By drawing upon an experimental project where academic research co-operated with local grassroots citizen groups and actively mediated interaction on the web across social boundaries and power hierarchies, the article aims to demonstrate the socio-cultural significance of civic web genres...|$|E
40|$|Indie studios, {{which used}} to have a {{challenging}} time creating and releasing games, are on the rise. In the past, these studios have had a hard time getting their hands on useable tools.

We begin by conducting a prestudy that looks at the statistics behind games on steam. After this we form our interview questions and conducted both standardized open-ended interviews as well as surveys.

40|$|A diffuse need of {{innovation}} and better performance affected governments and institutions in general. Citizens and even Institutions {{are looking for}} a general re-design of the public administration both in the front and back office. In such a renovation process the ICT support turns “government” into “e-government” that means: e-Government: Delivering complete services in public administrations to individuals, businesses and organisations combined with organisational change in order to significantly improve services and democratic processes and strengthen support to public policies; fostering quality and efficiency of information exchange; empowering citizens and public services clients. This is one of the attempts to define e-government used {{on the occasion of the}} World Summit on Information Society (WSIS). As it happens very often, a certain word or terminology in common use often means different things to different people. The term e-Government is one of such term. Depending on who you talk to their background, e-Government may mean technical and/or public policy issues around the internet. Before entering the core of the contribution it may be useful to clarify terms and definitions. The terms digital government, electronic government (e-Government), mobile government (m-Government) and electronic governance (e-Governance) are used widely to represent the use of information communication technologies in public sector organisations (e. g. local and central government, public companies, public archives, etc). The terms are very closely related, which causes confusion. Governments serve multiple roles – they provide services; they govern (e. g. set, monitor, and enforce standards within systems); and, they serve the public by governing. Because of this, the terms are often used interchangeably. For this reason, the three terms need to be defined, at least for a better understanding of the present contribution, in the following way: “Digital government refers to the umbrella term that comprises all uses of information and telecommunication technologies in the public sector” (Garson 2006); e-Government is one aspect of digital government, e-Government refers to the provision of governmental services by ICTs, particularly over the Internet; e-Governance refers to the use of ICTs for organisation of political activity within and beyond nation states. E-Governance “is one of a wide range of competing terms pertaining to use of new communication technologies, such as the Internet and mobile telephony, for political and governmental purposes. Other widely used terms that have overlapping meaning include: electronic democracy (e-Democracy), <b>online</b> <b>democracy,</b> cyber democracy, virtual democracy, online governance, tele-democracy, e-participation, e-Information, e-Decision-Making and e-deliberation (Chen 2008...|$|E
40|$|Notre Dame {{was well}} {{represented}} at an important political conversation held in Sydney in November. Politics lecturer John Rees {{reflects on the}} event. Just when we are tempted to believe that everything in politics is scripted, fixed, and predetermined, new influences come along that generate elements of unpredictability back into the system. The latest to emerge {{is the impact of}} digital media on political participation and communication. From John Howard’s U-Tube policy releases to Kevin Rudd’s Facebook friends, from new groups (both young and old) finding their political voice via the web to a new political party advocating <b>online</b> <b>democracy,</b> the impact of the “digital election” on our political culture is unmistakable. What enhances the unpredictable nature of this development is that players across the domains of politics, media, business and the community are still working {{out what to do with}} digital media and what it means for the politics of the future. Accordingly, conversations about it are open, exploratory, and feature a real diversity of voices. Welcome to the digital media ‘brainstorm’. On the morning of November 1 2007, I had the privilege of participating in a roundtable discussion on the topic “The Digital Election: Is Australian democracy becoming a conversation?” The event was an invitation only ‘on the record’ breakfast conversation hosted by public affairs consultancy Hill and Knowlton. Conversation participants included senior representatives from the Fairfax and News Limited press, Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells (Lib), Tanya Plibersek MP (Labor), Senate candidate Zoe Lamont (Senator Online), and representatives of digital media initiatives such as iVote Australia, Election Tracker and Vibewire. Facilitated by Jacquelynne Willcox and Steven Noble of Hill and Knowlton, the discussion was as vibrant as it was informative. At times there was consensus on the possibilities of digital media for broadening participation in the political process. Yet there was disagreement on the limits and dangers that come with such a development. Participants added different perspectives, depending on their specialty and interest. Not surprisingly, significant contributions to the forum were made by representatives of digital media groups. Noteworthy in this were inputs from University of Notre Dame students James Griffin (Politics and Journalism) and Thomas Griffin (Arts Law). James and Tom are two of the founders of iVote Australia, an online initiative dedicated to raising political awareness and participation amongst young people. It is a very successful initiative that continues to receive the moral support of the Politics Program at Notre Dame and of the University at large. In forums such as the “Digital Election” it is not uncommon to feel as though one has learned much more from the input of others than one has contributed. Yet I also felt well prepared for “Digital Election” brainstorm by the energy and involvement of Notre Dame students like the Griffins and Anthony Mason (iVote), as well as Joel Clark who is involved with the policy online initiative Election Tracker and now a Senate candidate (SA) for the political party Senator Online. Other politics students are actively involved ‘on the ground’ in election campaigns for the major political parties, or involved in community and lobby group activities. Representatives of both iVote Australia and Election Tracker have helped us explore the digital frontiers this semester in the subject PL 1001 Australian Politics. I have learned much from all of these students, which in turn has benefited our education journey together. We are definitely in the conversation.

40|$|As Andrew Chadwick {{noted in}} 2006, ???The issue {{is no longer}} whether {{politics}} is online, but in what forms and with what consequences???? Governments use the Internet for many reasons, including informing the public, facilitating voting, and communicating with constituents. Similarly, citizens engage with political institutions online {{in a variety of}} ways. William Dutton, who terms this engagement of citizenry with government the ???Fifth Estate???, delineates two institutional arenas: the use of ???the Internet and related ICTs to enhance existing democratic institutions and processes???and the networking of individuals to enable the public to hold all institutions of government and politics more accountable???. This poster will contrast websites that use the internet to facilitate representation (e. g., the Sunlight Foundation, Wikileaks) with those that focus on governance (e. g., Community Patent Review, SeeClickFix). These organizations differ in their fundamental objectives: the first type uses the Internet to influence democracy itself while the second engages citizens to do work they have already delegated to government. There are many examples of both types of organizations, both in the United States and abroad. Some use crowdsourcing to create or organize information; others present information to users but do not allow them to contribute. This poster will focus on organizations that operate in the US and use peer production; it will highlight their use of online collaboration, as well as their impact on issues of government transparency, democratic representation, and peer production of knowledge. The mission of the Sunlight Foundation is to ???using the revolutionary power of the Internet to make information about Congress and the federal government more meaningfully accessible to citizens. ??? As such, it sponsors online tools that allow the public to watch and contribute to knowledge about government spending, the legislative process, and the influence of lobbyists. One project of the Sunlight Foundation, PublicMarkup. org, allows the public to annotate bills before they are passed by Congress. Several 2008 bills were posted on the site, including the act that authorized the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). The Sunlight Foundation also sponsors projects that do not use peer production, such as MAPLight. org, which allows combines data on campaign contributions and voting records for legislators. Wikileaks. org allows users to upload ???leaks??? [...] information about corrupt officials, scandals, and other misbehavior ??? in an anonymous manner. Wikileaks thus crowdsources the whistle-blower role in government (as well as other areas) and also the fact-checking of whistles blown. Wikileaks operates in nearly every country (as it is a wiki, countries can be added very easily), but is represented by Australian Hacker Julian Assange. Situated between journalism and governance, Wikileaks is more difficult to classify, but as an example of whistle-blowing on government corruption, it aims to improve the democratic process. Community Patent Review is a striking example an organization that uses peer production for governance. Community Patent Review is a ???web-based application that allows third parties to comment on patents before they are issued. Large patent holders, including General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, and Red Hat, have agreed {{to be part of the}} pilot, and the patent office has agreed to waive the usual fee for third party comment submissions and give the patents of pilot participants expedited review. ??? This provides a public adjunct to the Constitutionally designated function of the Patent Office; this citizen participation does not follow the chain-of-command of the patent office, but instead involves citizens (and non-citizens) in a new way, as users and collaborators. SeeClickFix operates at the local level. SeeClickFix ???allows anyone to report and track non-emergency issues anywhere in the world via the internet. This empowers citizens, community groups, media organizations and governments to take care of and improve their neighborhoods. ??? Users post local maintenance issues (e. g., potholes, vandalism), and others can volunteer to fix them. This enhances the role of existing local government functions (e. g., the parks department, the roads department) by again involving the public directly in a non-democratic capacity. Each of these organizations uses a different method to apply peer production to the task of improving democracy or of improving governance. Sometimes these tasks are mixed: MySociety, a UK organization similar to the Sunlight Foundation, creators of FixMyStreet (which inspired SeeClickFix in the US), hosts an e-petition process, which facilitates, instead of street fixing, the development of petitions that are sent directly to the Prime Minister. Organizations can be difficult to classify by these criteria. Creative Commons, founded in 2001, uses open licensing to bypass the more restrictive features of copyright law. Although it is not technically ???crowdsourced???, it does rely on the network effects of its many users who can build on each others??? creations as long as they are all licensed under Creative Commons. In this aspect, it is an example of the second type of organization. Instead of lobbying to change copyright law, it bypasses the structure chosen by democratically elected representatives and instead uses a ???Fifth Estate???, user-governance model. People decide for themselves what kind of copyright they would like to have and share that with others. Similarly, SeeClickFix does not try to recall local parks officials, but instead points out where citizens can do local maintenance themselves; Community Patent Review does not aim to reform the US Patent Office, but instead facilitates public input. The subject of the first group is representation; the subject of the second is a social issue, such as property rights in innovation or local property damage. Both approaches involve transparency, but the second approach involves further transparency as the citizens are full participants in the entire process. For example, what a government does with Wikileaks information or how the annotations on laws are processed is not necessarily transparent. Whether or not a problem ahs been fixed on SeeClickFix is transparent. In other words, the first category still involves representation, which naturally decreases transparency, while the second does not. These two approaches are in some degree of tension: if, in the extreme case, all government functions were handled directly by citizens, there would be no need for representative democracy. On the other hand, if transparency is all that democracy needs, then perhaps the more communitarian approach would not be necessary. In some ways, these two approaches are, to use an economic term, substitutable goods. Both of these approaches are simply the result of applying peer production to public goods, such as well-maintained public spaces, efficient patent issuance, or well-formulated laws. As these organizations grow, they will necessarily blur these lines and create further emergent forms of <b>online</b> <b>democracy</b> and online governance...|$|E
