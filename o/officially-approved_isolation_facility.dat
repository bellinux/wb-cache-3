40|$|AbstractDue to {{the recent}} {{outbreaks}} of infectious diseases, such as {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS), Influenza and Ebola, <b>isolation</b> <b>facilities</b> have played an important role to prevent infectious diseases from spreading at initial stage. An isolation ward is a facility to isolate patients physically and to care them safely. One way to isolate a patient physically is to build a negative pressure <b>isolation</b> <b>facility.</b> However, unexpected failure or misuse of such facility makes it difficult to maintain negative pressure and eventually causes secondary infection, leaking the infectious pathogen to outside of the isolation ward. This study identifies the amount and velocity of leakage air from a patient ward by tracer gas experiment under abnormal operations of an <b>isolation</b> <b>facility.</b> In addition, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) allowed us to observe the outflow mechanism of pollutant. The results show that abnormal operations of a facility spreads pathogens to neighboring areas immediately and timely actions should be prepared against them...|$|R

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Until mid of 2010 the European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases conducted a cross-sectional analysis of <b>isolation</b> <b>facilities</b> in Europe, recruiting 48 <b>isolation</b> <b>facilities</b> in 16 countries. Three checklists were disseminated, assessing 44 items and 148 specific questions. The median feedback rate for specific questions was 97. 9 % (n = 47 / 48) (range: n = 7 / 48 (14. 6 %) to n = 48 / 48 (100 %). Although all facilities enrolled were nominated specialised facilities' serving countries or regions, their design, equipment and personnel management varied. Eighteen facilities fulfilled the definition of a High Level Isolation Unit'. In contrast, 24 facilities could not operate independently from their co-located hospital, and five could not ensure access to equipment essential for infection control. Data presented are not representative for the EU in general, as only 16 / 27 (59. 3 %) of all Member States agreed to participate. Another limitation of this study is the time elapsed between data collection and publication; e. g. in Germany one additional facility opened in the meantime. CONCLUSION: There are disparities both within and between European countries regarding the design and equipment of <b>isolation</b> <b>facilities.</b> With regard to the International Health Regulations, terminology, capacities and equipment should be standardised...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{shortage}} of <b>isolation</b> <b>facilities</b> in hospitals was highlighted during the {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) pandemic in 2003. Yet, as {{the nature and}} scale of future pandemics cannot be adequately estimated, it is difficult to justify construction of sufficient <b>isolation</b> <b>facilities.</b> A fast-track and cost-effective ventilation strategy for the retrofitting of existing general wards could help hospitals deal with patient surges. Aim: This article reviews the effectiveness of a fast-track, makeshift isolation approach employed during the SARS outbreak which involved installing simple window-mounted exhaust fans to create negative-pressure airflow in hospital general wards. Methods: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to assess by simulation whether the approach adopted meets US Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention requirements for properly constructed isolation wards. Findings: CFD simulation revealed that this makeshift approach could match the ventilation standards of isolation rooms. The approach was certainly effective as no secondary infections were reported in hospitals that used it during SARS. Conclusions: When there is a shortfall in <b>isolation</b> <b>facilities</b> to accommodate a surge in patients, the proposed ventilation set-up could be quickly and widely implemented by existing general wards.

40|$|An {{important}} feature of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Canada, Singapore, and Hong Kong was that many health care workers (HCWs) developed SARS after caring for patients with SARS. This has been ascribed to inadequate or ineffective patient isolation. However, {{it is difficult for}} dense cities to provide sufficient <b>isolation</b> <b>facilities</b> within a short period of time. This has raised concerns from the public for new strategies in the planning and design of <b>isolation</b> <b>facilities.</b> Considering that SARS or other infectious diseases could seriously damage our society’s development, <b>isolation</b> <b>facilities</b> that could be rapidly and economically constructed with appropriate environmental controls are essential. For this reason, the design team of the Department of Architecture collaborated with a special task force from the Faculty of Medicine, who are the frontline medical officers treating the SARS patients, to design Rapidly Assembled Isolation Patient Wards. Both architecture and medicine are well established disciplines, but they have little in common in terms of the mode of knowledge construction and practice. This induced much intellectual exploration and research interest in conducting this study. The process has provided an important reference for cross disciplinary studies between the architectural and medical domains...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{handling}} of human remains may pose a risk for transmission of highly infectious agents.

The European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases conducted in 2009 a survey in 48 <b>isolation</b> <b>facilities</b> in 16 European countries.

40|$|To {{assess the}} medical {{severity}} index for a disaster, {{there are three}} capacities that should be considered. They were medical rescue capacity (MRC), medical transport capacity (MTC) and hospital re-sponse capacity (HRC). We retrospectively analyzed the capacities of Taipei City and tried to find the limiting factor for {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) before and after the endemics this year. On April 9 2003, the available isolation beds were totally 128, whereas total number of beds enrolled in Emergency Response Hospitals in Taipei City was 20, 160. In other words, the percent-age of isolation beds was only 0. 63 %. Ideal HRC for those hospitals should be 630 patients per hour that was significantly higher than the real needs (0. 38 cases per hour). Because of the cumula-tive reported cases being 518 in northern area and the consideration of case accumulation from April 10 to June 10, however, the hospitals could work within their capacities in only 14 days. The total <b>isolation</b> <b>facilities</b> in Taipei cities were 630 beds (3. 1 %; P< 0. 01 v 0. 63 %) in July 2003 and accounted for 70 working days (P< 0. 01 v 14 days).

Twelve calves were weaned, transported, processed at a commercial feedlot and transported to <b>isolation</b> <b>facilities</b> three days later. An aerosol challenge of either 10 colony forming units of P. haemolytica or 10 plaque forming units of bovine herpesvirus- 1 virus was given to two groups of calves and the third group was not challenged. The fourth group was transported directly to the <b>isolation</b> <b>facilities</b> after weaning and aerosol challenged with P. haemolytica. The fifth group remained at the farm after weaning and was not challenged. All transported animals had elevated plasma cortisol levels which remained above normal {{for at least three}} days postchallenge. The blastogenic response of all calves was depressed after leaving the farm and remained depressed throughout the experiment. The suppression correlated well with elevated serum cortisol levels. Calves processed through the feedlot encountered bovine herpesvirus- 1 because eight out of 12 animals seroconverted to this antigen. Most calves seroconverted to P. haemolytica whether they were experimentally challenged or not. Where the unchallenged calves encountered P. haemolytica is unknown.
