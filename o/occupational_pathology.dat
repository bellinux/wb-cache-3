ROS in large amounts clearly have detrimental effects on cell physiology, whereas low concentrations of ROS are permanently produced in cells and play a role as signaling molecules. An imbalance in ROS production and defense mechanisms can lead to pathological vascular remodeling, atherosclerosis being among them. The aim of this review is to examine different sources of ROS {{from the point of view}} of their participation in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular risk. Among the possible sources of ROS discussed here are mitochondria, NADPH-oxidases, xanthine oxidase, peroxidases, NO-synthases, cytochrome P 450, cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and hemoglobin of red blood cells. A great challenge for future research is to establish interrelations, feedback and feed-forward regulation mechanisms of various sources of ROS in development of atherosclerosis and other vascular pathologies...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the results of {{physiological}} research performed on 9 occupational groups of migrants who came to Moscow region of Russia from southern Central Asia republics. We studied adaptation processes characteristics in labor migrants as per cardiovascular system parameters and neuromuscular apparatus parameters. We revealed peculiarities in heart rate variability (changes in stress index S 1, values of AMo, VLF spectrum power, PARS parameter) in migrants de-pending on neuro-emotional nature of working activity and muscular loads intensity. We detected apparent decrease in dynamometric parameters of endurance and maximum working capacity of arms muscles and backbones and legs muscles by the end of their working day. We created a procedure to determine an adaptation process stage under combined effects ex-erted by labor physical hardness and neuro-emotional intensity; unsatisfactory adaptation increases health disorders risks. We showed that long-term and intense impacts by factors determining labor process hardness caused occupational diseases of musculoskeletal system and peripheral nervous system. We revealed that as labor intensity grew working stress in a body also increased and it could transform into overstrain and occupational diseases evolvement (primary hypertension, ischemic heart diseases, and neurotic disorders). A distinctive feature is that men suffer from cardiovascular system pathologies more frequently while women tend to suffer from nervous system pathologies. In this relation, we should make separate predictions of <b>occupational</b> <b>pathology</b> probability depending on labor intensity level for males and females. Adaptation processes optimization should include organization of rational work and rest regime, healthy lifestyle for-mation, improvements in medical aid for migrants. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: An {{objective}} {{determination of}} the range of vocal efficiency is rather difficult. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the possibility of application of short-term acoustic efficiency analysis in diagnosing occupational voice disorders. Material and Methods: The study covered 98 people (87 women and 11 men) diagnosed with occupational dysphonia through videostroboscopic examination. The control group comprised 100 people (81 women and 19 men) with normal voices. The short-term acoustic analysis was carried out by means of DiagnoScope software, including classical parameters (Jitter group, Shimmer group and the assessment of noise degree NHR), as well as new short-term efficiency parameters determined in a short time period during sustained phonation of the vowel “a. ” The results were then compared. Results: The values of all the examined classical parameters were considerably higher in the study group of pathological voices than in the control group of normal voices (p = 0. 00). The aerodynamic parameter, maximum phonation time, was significantly shorter by over 0. 5 s in the study group than in the control group. The majority of the acoustic efficiency parameters were also considerably worse in the study group of subjects with occupational dysphonia than in the control group (p = 0. 00). Moreover, the correlation between the efficiency parameters and most of the classical acoustic parameters in the study group implies that for the voices with <b>occupational</b> <b>pathology</b> the decreased efficiency of the vocal apparatus is reflected in the acoustic voice structure. Conclusions: Efficiency parameters determined during short-term acoustic analysis can be an objective indicator of the decreased phonatory function of the larynx, useful in diagnosing occupational vocal pathology.

40|$|In {{the usual}} {{university}} curricula of stomatology, the aspects {{related to the}} education and preservation of manual skills are not thoroughly and sufficiently studied, which explains {{the theme of the}} present study, dedicated to the reorganization of the curricula content of the disciplines involved in the development of practical competences in the field. Each student possesses a certain individual manual skill, understood by the teacher only superficially, which is also the case of his natural aptitudes and deficiencies. That is why, the training developed during student years should be prolongued along the whole professional career of the stomatologist, which requires changing of one’s usual attitude versus his own performances, along with a conscious and continuous education for maintaining and developing the expected practical competences. Special attention should be paid to avoiding physical and psychic fatigue, by a corresponding dosage of the intensity of one’s activity, along with a suitable prophylaxy of <b>occupational</b> <b>pathology</b> by practising of relaxation exercises adapted to such a specific profession. An important premise of the implementation of the concept of manual skill refers to the fact that instrumentalized parctising of dental medicine, always influenced by the continuous technological development, assumes the utilization of a large range of medical apparata and devices, in the absence of which stomatology would be a wholly different thing. Organization of an ergonomic stomatological system represents another important objective of the program of skill education as, in itself, it does not cover the shortcomings of a disordered activity. Essential in such situations is the sequential knowledge of the execution times for the various restorative dental, endodontic, periodontal, surgical, prosthetic procedures, on categories of age, the realization of which maintains the manual skills, by their execution on electro-mechanical and haptic simulators and by the development of practical competences on the pacient, under the direct supervision of the didactic staff, after practical demonstration...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective This {{research}} work {{is dedicated to}} occupational health problems caused by ergonomic risks. The research object was road building industry, where workers have to work very intensively, have long work hours, are working in forced/constrained work postures and overstrain during the work specific parts of their bodies. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the work heaviness degree and to estimate the muscle fatigue of workers after one week work cycle. The study group consisted of 10 road construction and maintenance workers and 10 pavers aged between 20 and 60 years. Methods Physical load were analyzed by measuring heart rate (HR), work postures (OWAS) and perceived exertion (RPE). Assessments of the muscles strain and functional state (tone) were carried out using myotonometric (MYO) measurements. The reliability of the statistical processing of heart rate monitoring and myotonometry data was determined using correlating analysis. Results This study showed that that road construction and repairing works should be considered as a hard work according to average metabolic energy consumption 8. 1 ± 1. 5 kcal/min; paving, in its turn, was a moderately hard work according to 7. 2 ± 1. 1 kcal/min. Several muscle tone levels were identified allowing subdivision of workers into three conditional categories basing on muscle tone and fatigue: I – absolute muscle relaxation and ability to relax; II – a state of equilibrium, when muscles are able to adapt to the work load and are partly able to relax; and III – muscle fatigue and increased tone. It was also found out that the increase of muscle tone and fatigue mainly depend on workers physical preparedness and length of service, and less – on their age. Conclusion We have concluded that a complex ergonomic analysis consisting of heart rate monitoring, assessment of compulsive working postures and myotonometry is appropriate to assess the work heaviness degree and can provide prognosis of <b>occupational</b> <b>pathology</b> or work-related musculoskeletal disorders for the workers under different workload conditions. These results can also be used when deciding on necessary rest time and its periodicity. </p...|$|E

However, the problem is difficult to assess, as in many cases there is no objective origin for the complaints. Therefore, objective measures of function are of great interest. Trunk function in a population of 50 pediatric nurses was investigated with an isoinertial dynamometric device (Isostation B 200). Isometric torques, unresisted ranges of motion and dynamic velocities were measured in the sagittal plane. The population was divided into three groups: those subjects with no complaints (LBP 0) those with moderate low-back pain (LBP 1), and those with severe low-back pain (LBP 2). Forty-two (85 %) of those nurses had low-back complaints, 31 moderate and 11 severe. Isometric torques and velocities enabled a good discrimination between the three groups. There were significant differences between nurses usually carrying children on right or left arm and those carrying indifferently on any arm. The latter had better performances and less low-back pain. The velocity extension to flexion ratio was significantly decreased with the existence and severity of low-back pain. Isoinertial functional assessment has a good discriminatory value in this population. It enables one to draw ergonomic guidelines for child-carrying techniques. Finally, the modifications of the extension to flexion ratio help to determine that, in this population, rehabilitation programs should focus on dynamic back muscle strengthening.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to describe current practices in goal-setting within a subacute rehabilitation setting from the perspective of therapists representing the disciplines of <b>occupational</b> therapy, speech <b>pathology</b> and physiotherapy. Method. Qualitative semi-structured email interviews were conducted with therapists from the Geriatric Assessment and Rehabilitation Unit of an Australian hospital. Therapists were required to respond to questioning with reference to identified rehabilitation patients with stroke. Results. Three approaches to goal-setting were identified: therapist controlled, therapist led and patient centred. Goals aimed at the ICF levels of impairment and activity limitations were predominant. Barriers to a patient centered goal-setting approach largely outweighed facilitators. Potential successful resolutions were offered to overcome these barriers. Conclusions. The inability of patients to participate fully in the goal-setting process largely determines the approach taken by therapists. This influences the level of patient centeredness incorporated into the goal-setting process. Goals expressed at the level of impairment, by therapists, may be stepping stones to perceived patient goals at the levels of activity and participation. Barriers to a patient centered approach can be overcome through education of the patient and family regarding the nature of the injury and modification of communication between therapist and patient.

The Australian Therapy Outcome Measures (AusTOMs) enable measurement of the differences in client profiles and patterns of services provision across health care settings. In this paper we describe phase 1 of the study: the development and preliminary validation of the AusTOMs. Method. The UK TOMs, developed by Enderby, were scrutinized by the research team. A pilot core scale was developed, based on the structure of the TOM. Focus groups of expert clinicians for each profession, across the state of Victoria in Australia, analysed and refined the scales further. A mail-out survey was then sent to therapists across Australia to assess both face and content validity of the AusTOMs. Main results. A new tool, the AusTOM, was developed and tailored to the needs of each profession, with input from specialist clinicians and allied health researchers.

Despite this well-controlled environment, special circumstances (i. e. genetics), lifestyle, <b>occupational</b> work, <b>pathologies</b> (e. g. diabetes, cryptorchidism and varicocele) and environmental exposure to low oxygen (hypoxia) can result in a decrease of blood flow, nutrients and oxygen supply along with increased temperature. All of these conditions, besides those that cause some pathological conditions, may lead to subfertility or infertility. However, they also represent unique conditions that help us to address some crucial questions about the cell biology and physiology of spermatogenesis: what advantage is there for the spermatogenic cell processes mentioned above taking place under mild hypothermia? What are the molecular and physiological processes that make spermatocytes especially vulnerable to high temperatures? What mechanisms of adaptation take place in the seminiferous tubules cells under hypoxia? What mechanisms lead to a decreased sperm output from spermatogenesis under hypoxia? Do these conditions have similar physiological and molecular pathways? In this chapter, we will review the available literature on human and animal models concerning ―extreme‖ conditions for spermatogenesis, such as: heat stress, hypoxia and pathological conditions like varicocele, cryptorchidism and diabetes. Our analyses suggest that germ cell apoptosis, oxidative stress and DNA damage are common features in all of these ―extreme‖ conditions. Furthermore, oxidative damage seems to be present in all of these conditions during the initiation step of cellular damage. This oxidative stress in the testicle is critical when it poses an imminent risk to the viability and quality of the reproductive cells of animals and humans subjected to extreme conditions. Thus, about 25 % of infertile patients are diagnosed with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in semen samples. It is well documented that oxidative damage and elevated ROS levels in germ cells lead to apoptosis, a likely cause of hypospermatogenesis and low sperm production in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: International {{collaboration}} {{is recognised for}} enhancing the ability to approach complex problems {{from a variety of}} perspectives, increasing development of a wider range of research skills and techniques and improving publication and acceptance rates. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe the current status of international collaboration in medical radiation science and compare this to other allied health occupations. Methods: This study utilised a content analysis approach where co-authorship of a journal article was used as a proxy for research collaboration and the papers were assigned to countries based on the corporate address given in the by-line of the publication. A convenience sample method was employed and articles published in the professional medical radiation science journals in the countries represented within our research team – Australia, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA) were sampled. Physiotherapy, speech <b>pathology,</b> <b>occupational</b> therapy and nursing were chosen for comparison. Results: Rates of international collaboration in medical radiation science journals from Australia, the UK and the USA have steadily increased over the 3 -year period sampled. Medical radiation science demonstrated lower average rates of international collaboration than the other allied health occupations sampled. The average rate of international collaboration in nursing was far below that of the allied health occupations sampled. Overall, the UK had the highest average rate of international collaboration, followed by Australia and the USA, the lowest. Conclusion: Overall, medical radiation science is lagging in international collaboration in comparison to other allied health fields...|$|R
