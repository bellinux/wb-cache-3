Pym goes on to become Jules Verne's Captain Nemo, eventually sinking the RMS Titanic. This story also uses elements of Edward Bulwer-Lytton's 1871 novel Vril.|$|E
5|$|In the drafts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alien</b> Resurrection screenplay, writer Joss Whedon {{included}} a death {{scene in which}} a lifeform was sucked through {{a gap in the}} hull of a ship. In the second draft, Perez was sucked through a fist-sized breach in the hull of the Auriga; this was changed in the final version to the Newborn being sucked through the window of the Betty. 20th Century Fox executives were skeptical about the final version, seeing it as a comedic scene contrasting with the overall tone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alien</b> franchise, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet persuaded them to leave the scene in.|$|E
5|$|Other genre {{productions}} {{that have}} been compared with the serial include the 1970 Doctor Who story Spearhead from Space.

5|$|Michael Weyland's {{ambiguous}} {{humanity is}} a subject of debate for viewers and critics, and speculation exists {{that he is an}} android more sophisticated than Bishop. In Cinema of Simulation: Hyperreal Hollywood in the Long 1990s, Randy Laist interprets this ambiguity as indicative of a theme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alien</b> franchise: what matters is a character's actions, not its species. Michael Weyland is a duplicitous character, and it is irrelevant whether he is a human or an android.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> small <b>aliens</b> in <b>the</b> final {{scenes were}} played by local girls in Mobile, Alabama. That {{decision}} was requested by Spielberg {{because he felt}} [...] "girls move more gracefully than boys." [...] Puppetry was attempted for <b>the</b> <b>aliens,</b> but <b>the</b> idea failed. However, Rambaldi successfully used puppetry to depict two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aliens,</b> <b>the</b> first being a marionette (for <b>the</b> tall <b>alien</b> that is <b>the</b> first to be seen emerging from the mothership) and an articulated puppet for <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> that communicates via hand signals with Lacombe near <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|R
25|$|In {{the years}} since <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> <b>Alien,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alien</b> has become one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's most {{recognized}} movie monsters and a popular-cultural icon. In 2003, <b>the</b> <b>Alien</b> was voted as the 14th most memorable screen villain by the American Film Institute.|$|R
5|$|Sladden is {{overcome}} {{by a powerful}} telekinetic force emanating from the alien craft and flees to the sanctuary of a church. Sladden tells Quatermass he saw a vision of hordes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> creatures. Quatermass believes this is a race memory. Seeking proof, he returns to Hobbs End, bringing a machine Roney {{has been working on}} which taps into the primeval psyche. While trying to replicate the circumstances under which Sladden was affected, he notices that Judd has fallen under its influence. Using Roney's machine, he is able to record her thoughts.|$|E
5|$|Some scenes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> nest {{were shot}} at the {{decommissioned}} Acton Lane Power Station in Acton, London. The crew {{thought it was a}} perfect place to film because of its grilled walkways and numerous corridors, but had to spend money to remove asbestos from the station. The Atmosphere Processor set was not dismantled after filming, and was reused in 1989 as the Axis Chemicals set for Batman (1989).|$|E
5|$|Spall {{auditioned for}} another role, but Ridley Scott {{asked him to}} play Millburn. Trying to {{duplicate}} the reaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alien</b> cast to the chestburster scene, the director {{did not tell the}} Prometheus cast that a Hammerpede puppet was in the silicon replica of Spall's body; Kate Dickie's scream is genuine. The character of Milburn was criticized, since no biologist would touch an unidentified, extraterrestrial organism displaying hostility. Spall defended his character, citing a deleted scene where Millburn holds a smaller, docile Hammerpede.|$|E
50|$|Alien Incident (Muukalaisten y√∂, lit. Night <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Aliens)</b> is a 1996 point-and-click graphic {{adventure}} game. It {{was developed}} by Finnish game developers Bloodhouse and Housemarque and published by GameTek for the MS-DOS platform.|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>aliens</b> finally {{emerge from}} the mothership, they select Roy to join them on their travels.

Lacombe uses Curwen hand signs that {{correspond}} to <b>the</b> five-note <b>alien</b> tonal phrase. <b>The</b> <b>alien</b> replies with <b>the</b> same gestures, smiles, and returns to its ship, which ascends into space.|$|R
50|$|Finished in 1978, it {{was first}} printed in 1983 by Czytelnik Publishing House. It belongs to <b>the</b> genre <b>of</b> social science fiction of dystopia type and {{describes}} <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth under control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aliens.</b>|$|R
5|$|The episode {{featured}} the penultimate appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> black oil; {{it would appear}} for a final time via flashback in the series' finale. Visual effects for the black oil were created with molasses, chocolate syrup, and computer-generated imagery (CGI). A scene showing black oil {{coming out of a}} worker's eyes, ears, and mouth was mostly filmed on a visual effects stage. Nine takes were needed to get the syrupy mixture to spill correctly.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot is {{loosely based}} on the film, as players take {{the role of the}} film's primary Predator. After the events of the first film <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alien</b> vs. Predator franchise, the Predator has been charged by his society to hunt down and destroy any trace of Alien {{activity}} taking place in a small American town, in order to avoid its detection by humanity.|$|E
5|$|Though Q goads Picard into {{punishing}} the Bandi, Picard refuses, instead ordering the Enterprise {{to fire a}} vivifying energy beam onto Farpoint after the station is evacuated. The beam allows the land-bound creature to transform back into its jellyfish-like form, and it flies into orbit to join its fellow being. As the crew watches the reunion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> creatures, Q reluctantly tells Picard that they have succeeded in their test, but hints that they will meet again.|$|E
50|$|Cartoon Network {{became more}} {{involved}} in <b>the</b> designs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aliens</b> than <b>the</b> company was for '‚ÄôBen 10'‚Äô. The company along with Boomerang, suggested to the filmmakers that combining <b>aliens</b> be <b>the</b> main draw for the sequel.|$|R

5|$|Winona Ryder as Annalee Call, {{the newest}} crew member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Betty. She recognizes Ripley and has {{knowledge}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Aliens.</b> Call is revealed during <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film to be a synthetic and helps the surviving crew interface with the Auriga.|$|R
5|$|Unlike many of {{the sets}} {{featured}} on the show which were filmed on a Fox soundstage, the shot of the buried alien space craft was actually filmed in the hills near Simi Valley, California. Carter wanted a full-scale mock-up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> ship {{to be buried in}} the ground. This was unusual for the show; usually, {{a small portion of the}} ship would have been buried in the ground and the rest would have been filled in either via digital graphics, or with a scale model. In this episode, however, all of the shots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> ship, sans the take off, were done practically. To create the otherworldly glow of the ship, over 100 lamps were hidden within the craft. In addition, the ship itself was covered in glyphs that are supposed to be part of an unknown alien language. This was accomplished by designing fictional characters and programming them into a computer. These were then printed as letters which could be applied to the ship's hull.|$|E
5|$|A Syndicate surgeon {{attempting}} to procure the alien fetus is killed by one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> rebels, who assumes his form. Krycek finds the dead surgeon and the fetus missing, and tells Spender that the rebels {{are now going}} to succeed in their goals to halt colonization. The Syndicate and its families gather at El Rico Air Force Base. Shortly after Fowley arrives, a white light appears around one end of the hangar. It is revealed to be the rebels, who surround and immolate the entire Syndicate‚Äîexcept for The Smoking Man and Fowley‚Äîwho escape by car.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} models for testing {{artificial}} intelligence {{have been noted}} by philosophers as being relevant to the themes present in Scott's filmography. The test most commonly associated with artificial intelligence in his work is the Turing test, created by the English computer scientist Alan Turing. Turing's argument was {{that there is no}} significant difference between a human and an android, which would be apparent when a human would be unable to identify if the individual they are communicating with is a human or android. In Blade Runner, the method for identifying the physically identical replicants is by administering the fictional Voight-Kampff test, which detects disparities in emotional responses. Though a replicant would fail the Turing test, an android at the chronological marker of Alien, such as Ash, would likely perform exceedingly well. Additionally, the Chinese room, created by John Searle, has been postured as a test relevant to the androids <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alien</b> franchise. As the test determines if someone can identify what is Chinese lettering without knowing what it means, philosophers have drawn a parallel to Ash, who may uncannily emulate a human, though fail to understand {{what it means to be}} one. Kang described David's eventual introduction as another android character created by Scott as a synthesis between both Alien and Blade Runner, with the character being capable of passing the Turing test like Ash, yet also able to pass the Chinese room test like a replicant, implying that he would indeed be the first living android <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alien</b> franchise.|$|E
50|$|After {{destroying}} <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> {{fighter and}} its pilot in a fast-paced dogfight, the UFO crashes at Nick's high school graduation. Nick then uses fixing the UFO as his science project and {{is allowed to}} graduate. Nick wins Julie over and they kiss, Tyler gets a date with Katie Wallace and they get to keep the UFO. Assuming that all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aliens</b> were destroyed, <b>the</b> boys go on with their lives. However, at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movie while taking the UFO for a joy-ride (With its new stereo system that Nick installed which is notably blasting <b>the</b> theme song <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movie, Low Day by Capra), four agent Armstrongs are seen watching them, revealing at least four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aliens</b> survived and are plotting another attack on them and the human race, thus leaving <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> a sequel.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{a mistake}} by Livewire and <b>the</b> {{intentional}} transmissions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aliens</b> themselves, Blue Jay's efforts, along with <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> his temporary allies, were broadcast to every television on Earth {{and to many}} alien worlds beyond. This makes them intergalactically famous.|$|R
500|$|Isobe {{discusses}} {{his findings}} with Kumara and a physician, Dr. Matsuda, who believes {{they should get}} photographs via a rocket. The photographs they retrieve, however, {{turn out to be}} unclear, though they deduce the object has a high energy output. In the meantime, the extraterrestrials have been unsuccessfully attempting to contact humans. They begin appearing in lakes and rivers, frightening local fishermen and sailors. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aliens</b> manages to secure a photo of Hikari Aozora, a famous Japanese entertainer. [...] Their plan is for one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aliens</b> to mutate into <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> Aozora. [...] Back aboard the space station, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pairan leaders, Ginko, volunteers herself. Her starfish form is slowly mutated into a human form.|$|R
