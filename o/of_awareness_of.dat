5|$|The {{primary unit}} of social {{organisation}} in Germanic and Celtic Europe {{of the early}} Middle Ages was the kin group and this was probably the case in early Medieval Scotland. The mention of descent through the female line in the ruling families of the Picts in later sources and the recurrence of leaders clearly from outside of Pictish society, {{has led to the}} conclusion that their system of descent was matrilineal. However, this has been challenged by a number of historians who argue that the clear evidence <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> descent through the male line suggests that this more likely to indicate an agnatic system of descent, typical of Celtic societies and common throughout North Britain.|$|E

25|$|Intuitively, {{this may}} {{feel like a}} {{cooperative}} approach. However, though a team may aim to negotiate in a cooperative or collaborative nature, the outcome may be less successful than is possible, especially when integration is possible. Integrative potential is possible when different negotiation issues are of different importance to each team member. Integrative potential is often missed {{due to the lack}} <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> each member's interests and preferences. Ultimately, this leads to a poorer negotiation result.|$|E

25|$|In the UK, scepticism {{about food}} {{intolerance}} {{as a specific}} condition influenced doctors' (GPs') perceptions of patients and of the patients' underlying problems. However, rather than risk damaging the doctor-patient relationship, GPs chose - despite their scepticism and guided by an element <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> the limitations of modern medicine - to negotiate mutually acceptable ground with patients and with patients' beliefs. As a result, whether due to a placebo effect, a secondary benefit, or a biophysical result of excluding a food from the diet, the GPs acknowledge both personal and therapeutic benefits.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifespan}} {{of patients}} with NPC is usually related {{to the age of}} onset. Children with antenatal or infantile onset usually succumb in the first few months or years of life, whereas adolescent and adult onset forms of Niemann–Pick type C have a more insidious onset and slower progression, and affected individuals may survive to the seventh decade. Adult cases of NPC are being recognized with increasing frequency. It is suspected that many patients affected by NPC are undiagnosed, owing to lack <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> the disease and the absence of readily available screening or diagnostic tests. For the same reasons the diagnosis is often delayed by many years.|$|E

25|$|This {{conclusion}} was challenged {{in the same}} journal by James R. Brorson and Kathleen Brewer, who stated that this hypothesis failed to explain why Paul's companions heard a voice (Acts 9:7), saw a light, or fell to the ground. Furthermore, no lack <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> blindness (a characteristic of cortical blindness) was reported in Acts, {{nor is there any}} indication of memory loss. Additionally, Paul's blindness remitted in sudden fashion, rather than the gradual resolution typical of post-ictal states, and no mention is made of epileptic convulsions; indeed such convulsions may, in Paul's time, have been interpreted as a sign of demonic influence, unlikely in someone accepted as a religious leader.|$|E
25|$|After a {{traumatic}} experience, {{a person may}} re-experience the trauma mentally and physically, hence trauma reminders, also called triggers, can be uncomfortable and even painful. It can damage people’s sense of safety, self, self-efficacy, {{as well as the}} ability to regulate emotions and navigate relationships. They may turn to psychoactive substances including alcohol to try to escape or dampen the feelings. These triggers cause flashbacks, which are dissociative experiences where the person feels as though the events is reoccurring. They can range from distracting to complete dissociation or loss <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> the current context. Re-experiencing symptoms are a sign that the body and mind are actively struggling to cope with the traumatic experience.|$|E

There were 75 students that were participated in this study. These students were randomly chosen by the researcher according to their form, which were form 1 until form 5, with 15 of the students from each of the form. In order to determine the students’ use of metacognitive reading strategies, Metacognitive <b>Awareness</b> <b>of</b> Reading Strategies Inventory (MARSI) that was invented by Mohkhtari and Reichard, (2002), and The Canadian National Survey, (2005) of Reading and Buying Books for Pleasure’s questionnaire were used by the researcher in order to gain the data. The data were analyzed using the frequency, percentage and also the mean score. However in order to analyze the relationship of both variables and their use <b>of</b> metacognitive <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> reading strategies, the regression was used by the researcher to gain the significant relationship between the dependent and independent variables. From this study it was found that most of the students have the average level <b>of</b> metacognitive <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> reading strategies. Furthermore based from this study, it was also revealed that students’ reading habits does affect the use <b>of</b> metacognitive <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> reading strategies by students. Students’ who have good reading habits have better use metacognitive <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> reading strategies. In addition, according to this study, it is also proven that students’ proficiency level does affect the metacognitive <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> reading strategies.
