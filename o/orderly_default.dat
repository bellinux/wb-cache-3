5000|$|Some {{economists have}} argued that, {{in the case}} of acute {{insolvency}} crises, it can be advisable for regulators and supranational lenders to preemptively engineer the orderly restructuring of a nation’s public debt- also called [...] "orderly default" [...] or [...] "controlled default".

50|$|Economists who favour this {{approach}} to solve the Greek debt crisis argue that a default is unavoidable for Greece in the long term, and that a delay in organising an <b>orderly</b> <b>default</b> (by lending Greece more money throughout a few more years) would just wind up hurting EU lenders and neighbouring European countries even more. Fiscal austerity or a euro exit is the alternative to accepting differentiated government bond yields within the Euro Area. If Greece remains in the euro while accepting higher bond yields, reflecting its high government deficit, then high interest rates would dampen demand, raise savings and slow the economy. An improved trade performance and less reliance on foreign capital would be the result.|$|E
40|$|Many economists expect catastrophic {{consequences}} if any country exits the euro. However, {{during the past}} century sixty-nine countries have exited currency areas with little downward economic volatility. The mechanics of currency breakups are complicated but feasible, and historical examples provide a roadmap for exit. The real problem in Europe is that EU peripheral countries face severe, unsustainable imbalances in real effective exchange rates and external debt levels that are higher than most previous emerging market crises. <b>Orderly</b> <b>defaults</b> and debt rescheduling coupled with devaluations are inevitable and even desirable. Exiting from the euro and devaluation would accelerate insolvencies, but would provide a powerful policy tool via flexible exchange rates. The European periphery could then grow again quickly with deleveraged balance sheets and more competitive exchange rates, much like many emerging markets after recent defaults an...|$|R

50|$|In May 2010 the two economists Jakob von Weizsäcker and Jacques Delpla {{published}} an article proposing a mix of traditional national bonds (red bonds) and jointly issued eurobonds (blue bonds) to prevent debt crises in weaker countries, {{while at the same}} time enforcing fiscal sustainability. According to the proposal EU member states should pool up to 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) of their national debt under joint and several liability as senior sovereign debt (blue tranche), thereby reducing the borrowing cost for that part of the debt. Any national debt beyond a country's blue bond allocation (red tranche) should be issued as national and junior debt with sound procedures for an <b>orderly</b> <b>default,</b> thus increasing the marginal cost of public borrowing and helping to enhance fiscal discipline. Participating countries must also establish an Independent Stability Council voted on by member states parliaments to propose annually an allocation for the blue bond and to safeguard fiscal responsibility.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} {{the moral}} hazard problem which arises in political or fiscal federations when member states anticipate being bailed {{out by the}} centre in case of financial distress. In particular, I examine whether an <b>orderly</b> <b>default</b> mechanism or deeper fiscal integration within the European Union can alleviate the soft budget constraint phenomenon and provide {{a solution to the}} sovereign debt crises engulfing the Eurozone {{and other parts of the}} world. The first essay adapts the standard Stackelberg approach of the bailout literature in order to study the effects of bankruptcy procedures on regional opportunistic behaviour. The insolvency mechanism is shaped by two parameters: the costs of default and the exemption level for public assets. The model lends support to the market discipline hypothesis if all public assets are exempt from seizure. If, by contrast, the exemption level for public assets is low, it is the central government rather than the credit market that discourages overborrowing since the former is incentivised to tax heavily indebted regions. The model's major policy insight is that an insolvency mechanism can lower the federation's welfare if it is not carefully designed. The second essay sheds light on the incentive effects of the sovereign debt restructuring mechanism which has been drafted by the Eurozone in response to the debt crisis. Employing a global game approach, the model analyses the impact of insolvency procedures on the size of the bailout, the level of effort exerted by the debtor country and EU welfare. Challenging some arguments in the policy literature, the model's major policy implication is that a half-hearted debt restructuring mechanism fails to mitigate the commitment and moral hazard problems embedded in the current EMU framework. The third essay questions the conventional wisdom that the Euro cannot survive without closer integration, using a simple political economy framework. The model compares the stability and welfare implications of the current "muddling through" scenario, an <b>orderly</b> <b>default</b> mechanism as well as a fiscal and a political union setting. Interestingly, the results suggest that the "muddling through" scenario is not more prone to break-up than the political or the fiscal union. The model's major policy recommendation is that implementing an <b>orderly</b> <b>default</b> mechanism and inserting an explicit exit clause into the European Treaties might prove more effective in preventing a Eurozone break-up than far-reaching institutional reforms...|$|E

In this study we have directly tested this hypothesis by examining the consequences of CNS ablation on the navigation in the periphery of a well-defined population of afferent sensory neurons. We show that {{in the absence of}} CNS-derived axons the axonal growth cones of this population of peripheral neurons extend with little directionality and instead of forming <b>orderly</b> projections, <b>default</b> into forming circular fasciculated pathways with each other.

40|$|The European Commission has {{recently}} proposed a new package of {{reforms of the}} Stability and Growth Pact. The package contains a number of good proposals. In particular, the increased focus on debt ratios is a very positive suggestion though this should be strengthened further. However, {{some of the other}} proposals, such as the new principle of prudent fiscal management and the scoreboard for non-fiscal imbalances, are poorly thought out and perhaps unworkable. A smaller number of well-focused proposals may end up working better than this complex, and perhaps overly ambitious, package. And a coherent policy to allow for <b>orderly</b> sovereign <b>defaults</b> in Euro area member states would probably place more pressure, via bond markets, on states to get their fiscal houses in order than would the proposed system of fines. ...|$|R
