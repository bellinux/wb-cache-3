5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else?</b> Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

He and his father pilot Striker Eureka, [...] "the strongest and the fastest" [...] Jaeger with eleven Kaiju kills, and make up the Resistance's [...] "go-to team". Kazinsky, a fan of science-fiction, was initially drawn by the film's concept, [...] "My immediate reaction was 'Holy crap, that's cool.' In the hands <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else,</b> you might sit there and go, 'Well, this might be terrible,' but with del Toro doing it, you kind of go, 'This {{is going to be}} amazing.'". Reflecting on his experience in the film, Kazinsky said in an interview, [...] "The most fun I have ever had in my entire life was Pacific Rim, playing Chuck was incredibly fun." ...|$|E

60|$|Much {{has been}} written of the {{emotions}} of the wanderer who, returning to his childhood home, finds it altered out of all recognition; but poets have neglected the theme--far more poignant--of the man who goes up to his room in an hotel and finds it full <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else's</b> dressing-gowns and bulldogs.|$|R
60|$|Guido was not Guido, and Isolde was not Isolde. They {{were wrong}} about the miniatures. Each {{of them was a}} picture <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 1986, {{she gained}} {{attention}} for campaigning against Page 3 photographs of topless models featured in The Sun and other British tabloid newspapers.

5000|$|... "The {{difference}} between shooting Following {{with a group}} of friends wearing our own clothes and my mum making sandwiches to spending $4 million <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else's</b> money on Memento and having a crew of a hundred people is, to this day, by far the biggest leap I've ever made."

60|$|Olly {{was first}} to find her speech. That speech, after the unfailing {{instincts}} of her sex in moments of excitement, was the instant arraignment <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> {{as the cause of}} that excitement, and at once put the whole universe on the defensive.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{she used}} to pretend she did not believe you would. But I knew better. I knew that when she said, over and over again, 'Is my father never coming for me?' she was {{thinking}} <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else.</b> And are you come to take her away?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{followed}} a sudden plunge of the steamer and all {{found themselves in}} the waves of the ocean.

5000|$|Other critics {{condemned}} the film for its subject matter. The Times called it [...] "gripping viewing but {{you feel like}} a voyeur <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else's</b> pain. After a while you may feel that you're watching a particularly scenic snuff film." [...] Andrew Pulver of The Guardian gave it one out of five stars, saying it [...] "could be the most morally loathsome film ever made." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bruce Springsteens 1978 album Darkness on the Edge of Town {{includes}} the song [...] "Adam Raised a Cain" [...] which references Cain, Abel, and East of Eden.

60|$|At her end of {{the table}} the {{conversation}} had turned once more to the great vital topic of Sally's legacy and what she ought to do with it. The next best thing to having money of one's own, is to dictate the spending <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else's,</b> and Sally's guests were finding a good deal of satisfaction in arranging a Budget for her. Rumour having put the sum at their disposal at a high figure, their suggestions had certain spaciousness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then let's {{take the}} narrowest view we can. When a farmer who hasn't much money loafs about the poolroom and lies on his back, smoking, it's plain that he's taking {{advantage}} <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else.</b> Perhaps the thing's shabbiest when {{he puts his}} responsibilities on his wife. That's what Bob does." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we mustn't {{dream of}} yelling," [...] said Sally, decidedly. [...] "It means a pretty long wait, you know. As far as I can gather, there's just a chance <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> coming in later, {{in which case}} he could let us out. But it's doubtful. He rather thinks that {{everybody}} has gone to roost." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why then," [...] replied Albert, [...] "I {{should have}} to make up the {{deficiency}} in some other way. I might ask Mr. Keep to put off the payment of the note, or I might borrow the money <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> to pay him, or I might sell some of my other stock. I could do any of these things well enough, but it would perhaps cause me some trouble and anxiety." ...|$|E

5000|$|Weasel {{has stated}} he [...] "had a blast {{arranging}} 'I Can See Clearly'", admitting that [...] "it {{was the first}} time I'd done a decent arrangement <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else's</b> song and I was very happy with the results." [...] However, the group's arrangement did not include the bridge from the original. [...] "Our version didn't really warrant a bridge, so I replaced it with the opening guitar lead, which then changed to a melodic lead for the last four bars", Weasel said.|$|R
5000|$|Yankovic mocked the {{situation}} on his Al TV special where he staged a mock interview with the rapper using footage from a real Eminem interview on MTV News. Eminem said [...] "I believe in...artistic expression." [...] Al countered with [...] "So you think, for example if somebody wanted to do, oh, I don't know, a parody <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else's</b> video, {{they should be able}} to... artistically express themselves and just do it?"

60|$|So {{they walked}} off again, quite as happily {{as if they}} had just stepped out of a snug little house of their own, to look for lodgings on account <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else.</b> Tom's {{simplicity}} was unabated, Heaven knows; but now that he had somebody to rely upon him, he was stimulated to rely a little more upon himself, and was, in his own opinion, quite a desperate fellow.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must think}} <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> too, when you wear that {{necklace}}," [...] replied Miss Crawford. [...] "You must think of Henry, {{for it was}} his choice in the first place. He gave it to me, and with the necklace I make over to you all the duty of remembering the original giver. It {{is to be a}} family remembrancer. The sister is not to be in your mind without bringing the brother too." ...|$|E
60|$|Ursula {{was much}} more {{carefully}} dressed, but she was self-conscious, always falling into depths of admiration <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else,</b> and modelling herself upon this other, and so producing a hopeless incongruity. When she dressed for practical purposes she always looked well. In winter, wearing a tweed coat-and-skirt and a small hat of black fur pulled over her eager, palpitant face, she seemed to move {{down the street in}} a drifting motion of suspense and exceeding sensitive receptivity.|$|E
6000|$|Festing {{spread out}} his hands. [...] "Certainly. What can I do? Charnock hustled me into it; {{he has a}} way <b>of</b> getting <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> {{to do the things}} he shirks. But I gave him my word." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is noted}} in [...] that had Effrafax simply painted the {{mountain}} pink and erected a <b>Somebody</b> <b>Else's</b> Problem field, {{he would have}} won his bet.

6000|$|... "You {{have always}} the {{alternative}} <b>of</b> marrying <b>somebody</b> <b>else,</b> you know, Mr. Payne," [...] {{she said with}} her most provoking and bewitching smile; [...] "but if you {{really do want to}} marry me, you know the conditions." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now that I {{have come}} to connubial bliss, and feel so [...] {{satisfied}} as to Nina's prospects, I have {{a word or two}} [...] to say about the bliss <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else.</b> Nina is my own [...] child, and of course comes first. But one Jonathan Stubbs [...] is my nephew, and is also very near to my heart. From all [...] that I hear, I fancy that he has set his mind also on [...] connubial bliss. Have you not heard that it is so? ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{made him}} look like he wished he hadn't said anything. And he wanted to git away from the subject, I reckon, because he begun to abuse the camel-driver, just the way a person does when he has got catched in {{something}} and wants to take it out <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else.</b> He let into the camel-driver the hardest he knowed how, and I had to agree with him; and he praised up the dervish the highest he could, and I had to agree with him there, too. But Tom says: ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is curious}} how the mind {{responds}} {{to the need for}} making an effort for the sake <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else.</b> If I had had only myself to think of, it would, I believe, have been a considerable time before I could have adjusted my thoughts to grapple with this disaster. But the necessity of conveying the truth quietly to Audrey and of helping her to bear up under it steadied me at once. I found myself thinking quite coolly how best I might break to her what had happened.|$|E
50|$|Being {{a writer}} myself, I don't {{like to take}} credit for things I didn't do. I didn't develop this script. David Mamet used some of my ideas and he didn't use some of them. I looked upon it more clinically, as a piece of {{material}} that has to be shaped, with certain scenes here or there. But as for the moral dimension, that's more or less the conception of the script, and I just implemented it with my skills - which are well developed. It's good to walk in <b>somebody</b> <b>else's</b> shoes for a while. You get out of your own obsessions; you are in the service <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else's</b> vision, and that's a great discipline for a director.|$|R
40|$|The self {{seems to}} be a unitary entity {{remaining}} stable across time. Nevertheless, current theorizing conceptualizes the self as a number of interacting sub-systems involving perception, intention and action (self-model). One important function of such a self-model is to distinguish between events occurring as a result of one's own actions and events occurring as the result <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else's</b> actions. We conducted an fMRI experiment that compared brain activation after an abrupt mismatch between one's own movement and its visual consequences with an abrupt mismatch between one's own movement and <b>somebody</b> <b>else's</b> visually perceived hand movement. A right fronto-parietal network was selectively active during a sudden mismatch between one's own observed and performed hand action...|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Australian {{explorer}} Eric Philips {{argued that}} this categorization of expeditions {{may have been a}} factor in the death of Finnish explorer Dominick Arduin, who died at Cape Arktichevsky in March 2004: [...] "I can't help but think that this tragedy permeated {{as a result of the}} pressure placed on adventurers to have their expeditions regarded as unsupported. Again, Explorers Web and others are placing undue pressure on the adventuring community by categorizing expeditions on their achievements... we should not be pressured into feeling that our efforts fall short <b>of</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else's</b> parameters." ...|$|R
