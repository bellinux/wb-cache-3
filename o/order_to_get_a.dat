5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{attempts}} {{to have a}} successful performance review in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> raise. He makes elaborate posters, prepares a ridiculous speech, and pumps himself up in the office's hallway. Unfortunately for him, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) successfully prank him by making him {{believe that it is}} a Friday instead of a Thursday. He arrives at the office very late the next day, much to Michael's annoyance.|$|E
5|$|Although Enron's {{compensation}} and performance management system {{was designed to}} retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system contributed to a dysfunctional corporate culture that became obsessed with short-term earnings to maximize bonuses. Employees constantly tried to start deals, often disregarding the quality of cash flow or profits, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better rating for their performance review. Additionally, accounting results were recorded {{as soon as possible}} {{to keep up with the}} company's stock price. This practice helped ensure deal-makers and executives received large cash bonuses and stock options.|$|E

5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to find a record company who would release the track, either because labels were worried about the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics or because they did not see any commercial potential in the track.

Only after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla give them a contract.|$|E
5|$|Recently, free {{electron}} lasers {{have been developed}} for use in X-ray crystallography. These are the brightest X-ray sources currently available; with the X-rays coming in femtosecond bursts. The intensity of the source is such that atomic resolution diffraction patterns can be resolved for crystals otherwise too small for collection. However, the intense light source also destroys the sample, requiring multiple crystals to be shot. As each crystal is randomly oriented in the beam, hundreds of thousands of individual diffraction images must be collected in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> complete data-set. This method, serial femtosecond crystallography, has been used in solving the structure of a number of protein crystal structures, sometimes noting differences with equivalent structures collected from synchrotron sources.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson {{family are}} {{employed}} as caretakers at Mr. Burns' mansion. Mr. Burns cuts the cable television wire and steals the beer, thinking this will ensure hard {{work from the}} family.

5|$|The cost of {{hospice care}} may {{be met by}} health {{insurance}} providers, including Medicare or Medicaid for eligible Americans. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or deductible by Medicare Part A except that patients are responsible for a copay for outpatient drugs and respite care, if needed. (Respite care may be necessary, for instance, if a family member who is providing home hospice care is briefly unable to perform his or her duties and an alternative care provider becomes necessary.) As of 2008, Medicare was responsible for around 80% of hospice payments, reimbursing providers differently from county to county with a higher rate for inpatient hospice care. A lower rate is paid for home care, with a higher rate paid for round-the-clock nursing care in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> patient's symptoms under control.|$|E
5|$|The number-one {{contender}} to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship {{was determined}} at Turning Point, with Christian Cage being pitted against Monty Brown.

On the November19, 2005 episode of Impact!, Cage reiterated his statement from Genesis, which angered Brown in the storyline. Brown said that Cage {{would have to go}} through him in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> title shot before the segment resulted in a fight between the two. Cage requested the match against Brown from NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko on the November26, 2005 episode of Impact!, which he was granted.|$|E

The ship stabilises and narrowly avoids a collision with Buckingham Palace. The Doctor then realizes that Astrid was wearing a teleport bracelet when she fell into the engine. In an emergency, the teleport bracelets were programmed to hold a person's molecular pattern in stasis until it can be recovered. The Doctor frantically attempts to retrieve Astrid's pattern, but the machine is too badly damaged. The Doctor reluctantly allows the ghostly remains of Astrid's atoms to dissipate into space. As the surviving passengers wait for rescue, the Doctor and Mr. Copper, who would otherwise be sent to prison for committing fraud in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job with the company, teleport to Earth and find that the TARDIS has landed unharmed in an snowy field, thrown from the ship after the collision.
