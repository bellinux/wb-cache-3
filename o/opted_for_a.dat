5|$|Benchley's drinking, {{already a}} problem, worsened {{and he was}} {{diagnosed}} with cirrhosis of the liver. (Ironically, when younger, he had been an adamant teetotaler.) While he completed his year's work, his condition continued to deteriorate, and Benchley died in a New York hospital on November 21, 1945. His family <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> private funeral service, and his body was cremated and interred in a family plot on the island of Nantucket.|$|E
5|$|In {{the battles}} of Modrica and Meçad 7,000 Ottoman forces were left {{dead on the}} {{battlefield}} along with thousands of horses. The Albanians had suffered 1,000 casualties themselves and, in their exhaustion, they refused to pursue the fleeing Ottoman forces. Hamza Pasha and his staff were ransomed to the sultan. Raimon d'Ortafà reported Skanderbeg's victory to Alfonso who received it with great exuberance. Skanderbeg's victory over a ruler even more powerful than Murad came as a great surprise to the Albanians. Skanderbeg's reputation among his allies was redeemed and the Dukagjini <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|Iwane Matsui {{was born}} in Nagoya on July 27, 1878. He was the sixth son of Takekuni Matsui, an impoverished samurai and former {{retainer}} to the daimyō of Owari during the Tokugawa shogunate. After completing elementary school, his parents insisted that he continue his education, but Matsui worried about his father's debts {{and did not want}} to burden him financially. Though he was a short, thin, and sickly young man, Matsui <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> career in the Army, because in Japan at that time military schools charged the lowest tuition fees.|$|E
25|$|Gadagkar {{devised a}} unified model that makes {{predictions}} about what {{proportion of the}} population of R. marginata “should <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> selfish solitary nesting strategy and what proportion should <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> altruistic worker strategy” (853). From this, he was able to predict that 5% should <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> the selfish solitary nesting strategy while 95% should <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> the altruistic worker strategy.|$|R

5|$|On December 5, 1972, Truman was {{admitted}} to Kansas City's Research Hospital and Medical Center with lung congestion from pneumonia. He developed multiple organ failure and died at 7:50am on December 26 {{at the age of}} 88. Bess Truman <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> simple private service at the library rather than a state funeral in Washington. A week after the funeral, foreign dignitaries and Washington officials attended a memorial service at Washington National Cathedral. Bess died in 1982; they are buried at the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum in Independence.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{originally planned}} {{for a summer}} release in July 2007, which was eventually postponed to November 2007; however, this date was postponed as well. The producers instead <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> summer release, and The Strangers had its theatrical debut in United States and Canada on May 30, 2008. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $21 million in 2,467 theaters, ranking #3 {{at the box office}} and averaging $8,514 per theater. The overall box office return was successful for a horror film, earning $82.4 million at the box office worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The teaser poster, {{featuring}} Anakin {{with his}} shadow forming Darth Vader's silhouette, {{was released on}} November 10, 1998. After Lucas <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> drawn theatrical poster, Drew Struzan, the artist responsible for the Special Edition posters, was commissioned to illustrate, and the poster was unveiled on March 11, 1999. Lucasfilm dictated that, contractually, Struzan's illustration was the only art the foreign distributors could use, and other than the text, {{it could not be}} modified in any way.|$|E

5|$|Vampyr was {{challenging}} for Dreyer {{to make as}} {{it was his first}} sound film and had to be recorded in three languages. To overcome this, very little dialogue was used in the film and much of the story is told with silent film-styled title cards. The film was shot entirely on location and to enhance the atmospheric content, Dreyer <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> washed out, soft focus photographic technique. The audio editing was done in Berlin where the character's voices, sound effects, and score were added to the film.|$|E
5|$|Wenger <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 4–5–1 formation, with Bergkamp {{playing as}} a lone striker. The absence of Henry also opened {{a place in}} midfield for Gilberto Silva, while José Antonio Reyes and Pirès were {{selected}} on the wings ahead of Ljungberg and Robin van Persie, who were both named as substitutes. As anticipated, Senderos's form saw him selected at centre-back ahead of Campbell, despite the England international's return from injury.|$|E
5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even {{lower on the}} social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short The Idle Class. The millionaire plot {{was based on an}} old idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he woke up, the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.|$|E

5|$|French-speaking naturalists {{in several}} {{countries}} showed appreciation of the much modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.|$|E
5|$|Kearsley's {{version was}} a marked popular success. Over {{the next few}} years, the {{publishing}} house issued further editions in quick succession, adding still more non-Raspe material along the way; even the full-length Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, again not by Raspe and originally published in 1792 by a rival printer, was quickly subsumed {{into the body of}} stories. In the process of revision, Raspe's prose style was heavily modified; instead of his conversational language and sportsmanlike turns of phrase, Kearsley's writers <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> blander and more formal tone imitating Augustan prose. Most ensuing English-language editions, including even the major editions produced by Thomas Seccombe in 1895 and F. J. Harvey Darton in 1930, reproduce one of the rewritten Kearsley versions rather than Raspe's original text.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 4–4–2 formation, {{with the}} only change from their FA Cup winning team four days earlier being the {{inclusion}} of Gary McAllister {{at the expense of}} Vladimír Šmicer. Robbie Fowler who had been disappointed to be a substitute for the FA Cup final was again on the bench. Emile Heskey and Michael Owen were picked to spearhead Liverpool's attack. Alavés opted to play a 5–3–2 formation, with Cosmin Contra, Dan Eggen, Antonio Karmona, Óscar Téllez and Delfí Geli in defence. In attack, Martín Astudillo and Jordi Cruyff were chosen to play behind lone striker Javi Moreno.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United's first {{departure}} of the 1998–99 season was Ben Thornley, who joined Huddersfield Town for £175,000 on 3 July 1998. A day later, Leon Mills signed for Wigan Athletic for an undisclosed fee, and Adam Sadler was released. Two of the club's longest-serving players, Brian McClair and Gary Pallister, also left. McClair had been at United since 1987, and <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> return to Motherwell in the Scottish Premier League; he had played at Fir Park in the early 1980s. Pallister agreed to return to Middlesbrough in a £2.5million deal, nine years after he had left them for a £2.3million transfer to Old Trafford. On 4 November 1998, Chris Casper signed for Reading for a fee of £300,000.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} St Johnstone, Myrie-Williams <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{move back to}} England, signing for League Two side Oxford United on 27 January 2011 {{for the rest of}} the 2010–11 campaign. However, the {{transfer}} collapsed as a result of Myrie-Williams having already played for two clubs during the 2010–11 season— playing one game for Dundee United and eight for St Johnstone. Under FIFA regulations, a player can not play for more than two permanent clubs in a season. The English Football Association could not register Myrie-Williams as they are bound by FIFA regulations. Similarly, the Football League could not register him to play for Oxford as his international clearance could not be granted.|$|E
5|$|Sweden, at {{that time}} an expansionist empire with an army {{designed}} to be maintained by the revenues of occupied territory, was conscious that a direct attack on her main adversary Russia could well result in a Dano-Polish–Russian alliance. Also, Sweden was prevented from forming a Swedish–Polish alliance by the refusal of John II Casimir to drop his claims to the Swedish crown and the unwillingness of the Polish–Lithuanian nobility to make the territorial and political concessions an alliance with Sweden would eventually cost, final negotiations in Lübeck during February 1655 ended without a result. Thus, Sweden <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> preemptive attack on the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to occupy its yet available territories before the Russians.|$|E

5|$|The era {{of record}} labels {{investing}} in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited {{control over their}} content and marketing, ended with the late 1970s. Corporate artists and repertoire staff exerted an increasing amount {{of control over the}} creative process that had previously belonged to the artists, and established acts were pressured to create music with simpler harmony and song structures and fewer changes in meter. A number of symphonic pop bands, such as Supertramp, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project and the Electric Light Orchestra, brought the orchestral-style arrangements into a context that emphasised pop singles while allowing for occasional instances of exploration. Jethro Tull, Gentle Giant and Pink Floyd <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> harder sound in the style of arena rock.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, a minute's silence was held, in memory of Rafa Benítez's father Francesco who died of heart failure on the Wednesday before the final. Both teams took the pitch wearing black armbands as a mark of respect. The match was delayed further when a fan invaded the pitch, he headed for one of the goals and got stuck in the goal before being caught. São Paulo lined up in a 3–5–2 formation, while Liverpool <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 4–4–1–1 formation. Liverpool had the first chance of the match inside the opening 79 seconds. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard's cross into the penalty area was met by Fernando Morientes, but the striker headed wide of the goal. Liverpool created more chances with Luis García missing the goal twice from headers. São Paulo had only created one chance, a shot from striker Amoroso, but they began to grow in confidence. They pressed forward after Amoroso's shot and defender Cicinho nearly scored with a lob from the halfway line which just went over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|In November 1949, {{following}} the death of Jimmy Dunne, Paddy Coad reluctantly accepted the position of player-manager having played with the club for almost eight years, in which time he had established himself {{as one of the best}} players in the League of Ireland. Coad <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> radical youth policy and over the course of his first three years in charge, signed virtually the entire schoolboy international side to Rovers. He employed revolutionary training methods with extra emphasis on technical skill and possession which resulted in a fast, passing style of football that contributed significantly to the development of the game in Ireland. In 1954, the club won the League of Ireland for the first time in fifteen years, while Paddy Ambrose finished the season as the team's leading scorer. Led by players like Liam Tuohy and Coad himself, the team known as Coad's Colts proceeded to win two more League titles and two FAI Cups, concluding the golden era of Irish football as one of its most successful teams.|$|E
