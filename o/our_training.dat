25|$|In general, we {{absolutely}} condemn {{acts of violence}} and human rights violations committed against individuals in Iraq because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This {{is an issue that}} we've been following very closely since we have been made aware of these allegations, and we are aware of the allegations. <b>Our</b> <b>training</b> for Iraqi security forces includes instruction on the proper observance of human rights. Human rights training is also {{a very important part of}} our and other international donors' civilian capacity-building efforts in Iraq. And the US embassy in Baghdad has raised, and will continue to raise, the issue with senior officials from the government of Iraq, and has urged them to respond appropriately to all credible reports of violence against gay and lesbian Iraqis.|$|E
2500|$|Personally, Courtney never drank an {{alcoholic}} beverage or used {{any form of}} tobacco. He also had strong views against alcohol and tobacco use by his rowers because he believed it would affect their ability to work. Courtney summed up his view: [...] "I have found in my experience that young men are much better off, and do better work, without alcoholic stimulants than with them, and they are, therefore, absolutely prohibited in <b>our</b> <b>training.</b> As to tobacco, I believe young men do better work when not using tobacco than when using it, and it is prohibited in <b>our</b> <b>training</b> here at Cornell University.” This went against old traditional rowing practice of drinking beer instead water during training. It was believed that alcohol would strengthen the body while water would weaken the body.|$|E
2500|$|White {{was best}} known at the School for his weekly commentaries on students' work, {{described}} as [...] "sympathetic yet searching criticisms that faithfully showed them how weak they were yet always somehow made them courageous and strong." [...] His student Marie Riggin Higbee Avery summarized what happened there by saying [...] "The rigor of <b>our</b> <b>training,</b> together with the indominable [...] spirit fostered in each of us, a result of Clarence White's teaching, was to carry {{a few of the}} least promising of the group to places of high honor in the photograph world." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was {{the success}} of his elder brother's fledgling {{television}} commercial production outfit, Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), that subsequently diverted his attention to film. His brother Ridley said, [...] "Tony had wanted to do documentaries at first. I told him, 'Don't go to the BBC, come to me first.' I knew that he had a fondness for cars, so I told him, 'Come work with me and within a year you'll have a Ferrari.' And he did!" [...] Scott said, [...] "I was finishing eight years at art school, and Ridley had opened Ridley Scott Associates and said, 'Come and make commercials and make some money' because I owed money left and right and centre." [...] He directed many television commercials for RSA while also overseeing the company's operation while his brother was developing his feature film career. [...] "My goal was to make films but I got sidetracked into commercials and then I took off. I had 15 years , and it was a blast. We were very prolific, and that was <b>our</b> <b>training</b> ground. You'd shoot 100 days in a year, then we gravitated from that to film," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Joint Forces Command, then {{caretaker}} of U.S. Military Joint Warfighting doctrine, {{noted the}} failure of US Army's Theater EBO software development and issued memorandum and a guidance documents from then commander, Marine General James Mattis, on Effects Based Operations. In these documents dated 14 August 2008 Mattis said, [...] "Effective immediately, USJFCOM will no longer use, sponsor or export the terms and concepts related to EBO...in <b>our</b> <b>training,</b> doctrine development and support of JPME (Joint Professional Military Education)." [...] Mattis went on to say, [...] "...we must recognize that the term [...] "effects-based" [...] is fundamentally flawed, has far too many interpretations and {{is at odds with}} the very nature of war to the point it expands confusion and inflates a sense of predictability far beyond that which it can be expected to deliver." [...] The Mattis directive did not distinguish between various versions of EBO within the United States military, but it did state that the memorandum does not address the NATO version of EBO--implying that the reason is because [...] "NATO's policy focuses on the whole of government/Comprehensive Approach. Since the release of the Mattis EBO memo, he has reportedly indicated that the intent was not to make an assessment of the Air Force version of EBO, so the critical assessment seems to be levied against a brand of EBO taught by his command.|$|E
2500|$|Later that day, the Supreme Court {{issued a}} {{statement}} that it had ordered the army to remove Zelaya from office. The Supreme Court stated [...] "The armed forces, in charge of supporting the constitution, acted to defend the state of law and {{have been forced to}} apply legal dispositions against those who have expressed themselves publicly and acted against the dispositions of the basic law". On 30 June, the military's chief lawyer, Colonel Herberth Bayardo Inestroza Membreño, showed a detention order, signed 26 June by a Supreme Court judge, which ordered the armed forces to detain the president, identified by his full name of José Manuel Zelaya Rosales, at his home in the Tres Caminos area of the capital. It cited him for treason and abuse of authority, among other charges. Colonel Inestroza later stated that deporting Zelaya did not comply with the court order: [...] "In the moment that we took him out of the country, in the way that he was taken out, there is a crime. Because of the circumstances of the moment this crime occurred, {{there is going to be}} a justification and cause for acquittal that will protect us." [...] He said the decision was taken by the military leadership [...] "in order to avoid bloodshed". He said [...] "What was more beneficial, remove this gentleman from Honduras or present him to prosecutors and have a mob assault and burn and destroy and for us to have to shoot?" [...] Colonel Inestroza also commented that Zelaya's allegiance to Hugo Chávez was hard to stomach and [...] "It would be difficult for us, with <b>our</b> <b>training,</b> to have a relationship with a leftist government. That's impossible. I personally would have retired, because my thinking, my principles, would not have allowed me to participate in that." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I’m really {{fortunate}} {{to be given the}} crew members that I have on this mission. It’s myself and six others. We do swap one of our crew members with the expedition crew member on board. So Greg goes up, Greg stays on station and Garrett comes home. But the crew that was assigned to me—I’m really {{fortunate to}} have some really talented people. Ken Ham, as a pilot, knows the orbiter better than anybody I’ve seen. This is his first flight. My lead EVA crew member is Mike Fossum who did three spacewalks on my previous flight, STS-121. We’ve flown together before. I have all the confidence in the world in his ability to execute these EVAs. Karen Nyberg, my MS1, sits on the flight deck for ascent and entry. She’s also the lead for all the robotic arm operations. She’ll be flying three robotic arms in space, incredibly motivated, well ahead of the game and I expect great things from her. Ron Garan is my flight engineer, a colonel in the Air Force. This is going to be his first time in space as well as is Karen’s and Ken’s and he’s doing three spacewalks. So he's got a lot on his plate. He’s been doing great during training and he’s going {{to have the opportunity to}} prove himself during these three spacewalks. I kind of wish it was me getting to go outside. I can’t do that, but we expect great things from Ron as well. And then I have Aki Hoshide, our Japanese crew member, who grew up in New Jersey kind of like me. That’s an interesting thing about our flight—we have four people from New Jersey on the mission. I look at Aki as the payload commander. He is responsible for that Japanese laboratory and he has taken on that responsibility as completely as I could have hoped for. All through <b>our</b> <b>training</b> he’s been very much focused on the Japanese lab, making sure it’s ready to go, making sure we’re completely trained on the systems and everything we have to do. I’ve given him a lot of responsibility and he’s completely taken it on." ...|$|E

In all our dealings, whether with plants, or animals, or with the human soul, we ought, in <b>our</b> <b>training,</b> to act very gently in respect to all that pertains to the embryo condition.|$|E

60|$|Here {{his words}} became indistinct as our wagons rattled on; but his heaving {{shoulders}} and brandishing fist attested {{that he had}} only begun to lay the curse.

With boys it was different. Such as have been under <b>our</b> <b>training</b> from seven to ten years have had no acquaintance with the Church's terrors, and it was among these that I found my fifty-two.

60|$|Analogous it may be, but not {{precisely}} similar; {{and for this}} reason: That the collective man, in the theory, must be infinitely more complex in his organization than the individuals {{of which he is}} composed. While between the educator of the one and of the other, there is simply the difference between a man and God. How much more complex then must his education be! how all-inscrutable to human minds much in it!--often as inscrutable as would <b>our</b> <b>training</b> of our children seem to the bird brooding over her young ones in the nest. The parental relations in all three cases may be--the Scriptures say that they are--expansions of the same great law; the key to all history may be contained in those great words--'How often would I have gathered thy children as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings.' Yet even there the analogy stops short--'but thou wouldest not' expresses a new element, which has no place in the training of the nestling by the dam, though it has place in <b>our</b> <b>training</b> of our children; even that self-will, that power of disobedience, which is the dark side of man's prerogative as a rational and self-cultivating being. Here that analogy fails, as we should have expected it to do; and in a hundred other points it fails, or rather transcends so utterly its original type, that mankind seems, at moments, the mere puppet of those laws of natural selection, and competition of species, of which we have heard so much of late; and, to give a single instance, the seeming waste, of human thought, of human agony, of human power, seems but another instance of that inscrutable prodigality of nature, by which, of a thousand acorns dropping to the ground, but one shall become the thing it can become, and grow into a builder oak, the rest be craunched up by the nearest swine.|$|E
6000|$|... "We've got rifles! We're real armed {{soldiers}} at last. Every blessed man {{has got a}} rifle. And they come from Japan! They are of a sort of light wood that is like new oak and art furniture, and makes one feel that one belongs to the First Garden Suburb Regiment; but I believe much {{can be done with}} linseed oil. And they are real rifles, they go bang. We are a little light-headed about them. Only <b>our</b> <b>training</b> and discipline prevent our letting fly at incautious spectators on the skyline.

60|$|It is not {{the first}} warning we have had. It has been raining {{warnings}} upon us; never was a slacking, dull people so liberally served with warnings of what was in store for them. But this event--this foreigner-invented, foreigner-built, foreigner-steered thing, taking our silver streak as a bird soars across a rivulet--puts the case dramatically. We have fallen behind in the quality of our manhood. In the men of means and leisure in this island there was neither enterprise enough, imagination enough, knowledge nor skill enough to lead in this matter. I do not see how one can go into the history of this development and arrive at any other conclusion. The French and Americans can laugh at our aeroplanes, the Germans are ten years ahead of our poor navigables. We are displayed a soft, rather backward people.

And if he doubted it, you had only to tell him your own story. You had only to tell him what you have just told me--that you yourself, an officer and a gentleman, thought you loved me, a vulgar, uneducated, savage girl, and that I, kinder to you than you to me or him, made you take it back across that tide, because I couldn't let you link your life with me, and drag you in the mire." ...|$|E
6000|$|And away she flounced {{in tears}} of wrath. Her mother went after her, and we laughed a little, it was {{impossible}} to help it, at the bathos of the chocolate creams; but, as Mr. Methuen said, she was really right, the amusement was undesirable, as savouring of evil. Edith, to my vexation, saw no harm in it; but Horace said very decidedly he hoped it would not happen again; and Margaret presently returned, saying she hoped that she had pacified Jane, and shown her that to descend as if there were an uproar in the school would only do much more harm than was likely to happen in that one evening; and she said to me afterwards, [...] "I see what has been wanting in <b>our</b> <b>training.</b> We have let children's loyalty run into intolerance and rudeness." [...] But Meg was quite innocent of there being any harm in it, and only needed reproof for being too much charmed by the pleasure for once to obey her dictatorial sister.|$|E
