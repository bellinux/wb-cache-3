5|$|The {{agreement}} was prepared at the EC {{council of ministers}} in The Hague on 5 July. It consisted of a Joint Declaration, and two annexes detailing {{the creation of an}} environment suitable to further political negotiations and guidelines for an <b>observer</b> <b>mission</b> to Yugoslavia. The agreement, which became known as the Brioni Declaration or the Brioni Agreement, required the JNA and the TDS to return to their bases, and stipulated that Slovene officials were to control Slovenia's borders alone and that both Slovenia and Croatia were to suspend all activities stemming from their declarations of independence for three months. The <b>observer</b> <b>mission</b> set out by the Brioni Agreement materialised as the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) tasked with monitoring the disengagement of the JNA and the TDS in Slovenia, and ultimately the withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia.|$|E

The U.N. observer team, which would be set up by the former UN Congo commander, Swedish Major General Carl von Horn. His disengagement agreement called for (1) Establishment of a demilitarized zone extending twenty kilometers on either side of a demarcated Saudi Arabian Yemen border, from which all military equipment was to be excluded; (2) Stationing of UN observers within this zone {{on both sides of the}} border to observe, report and prevent any continued attempt by the Saudis to supply royalist forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{agreement}} {{put an end}} to hostilities {{between the}} JNA and Slovene forces in the Ten-Day War. Slovenia and Croatia agreed to suspend activities stemming from their 25 June declarations of independence for a period of three months. The document also resolved border control and customs inspection issues regarding Slovenia's borders, resolved air-traffic control responsibility and mandated an exchange of prisoners of war. The Brioni Agreement also formed the basis for an <b>observer</b> <b>mission</b> to monitor implementation of the agreement in Slovenia. Eleven days after the agreement was made, the federal government pulled the JNA out of Slovenia. Conversely, the agreement made no mitigating impact on fighting in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|The {{maritime}} boundary between Bosnia–Herzegovina and Croatia was formally settled in 1999, {{but a few}} issues are still contested—the Klek peninsula and two islets in the border area. The Croatia–Montenegro {{maritime boundary}} is disputed in the Bay of Kotor, at the Prevlaka peninsula. The situation was exacerbated by the peninsula's occupation by the Yugoslav People's Army and later by the Serbian-Montenegrin army, which in turn {{was replaced by a}} United Nations <b>observer</b> <b>mission</b> that lasted until 2002. Croatia took over the area with an agreement that allowed Montenegrin presence in Croatian waters in the bay, and the dispute has become far less contentious since the independence of Montenegro in 2006.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} was eventually ended by the Lomé Peace Accord, which {{was signed in}} July 1999. The United Nations <b>Observer</b> <b>Mission</b> to Sierra Leone was replaced with the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), which included a force of 260 military observers. The observers were unarmed and tasked with monitoring the ceasefire mandated by the Lomé Agreement. The observer force, like UNAMSIL itself, was primarily made up of personnel from other African nations, but the United Kingdom contributed {{a small number of}} officers from the British Army, Royal Marines, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. In addition to the observers in Sierra Leone, personnel from the Royal Logistic Corps were serving in New York, assisting UNAMSIL with organising air-lifts to bring the mission up to its authorised strength.|$|E
5|$|Following the Pakrac {{clash between}} Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March 1991, the {{conflict}} had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA stepped in, increasingly supporting the Croatian Serb insurgents. In early April, {{the leaders of}} the Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control, known as SAO Krajina, with Serbia. In May, the Croatian government responded by forming the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde - ZNG), but its development was hampered by a United Nations (UN) arms embargo introduced in September. The Brioni Agreement established an <b>observer</b> <b>mission</b> which was eventually called the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM). The mission was tasked with monitoring the disengagement of belligerents in the Ten-Day War in neighbouring Slovenia, and the withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia. However, on 16 August, an ECMM helicopter was hit by Croatian Serb gunfire in western Slavonia, injuring one of the pilots. This caused the ECMM's scope of work to be formally expanded to include Croatia on 1 September.|$|E

The Democratic Alliance delegation (part SA Parliamentary <b>Observer</b> <b>Mission)</b> clashed with the minister and eventually submitted a separate report contradicting her findings. The elections were widely denounced and many accused Zanu-PF of massive and often violent intimidation, using food to buy votes, and large discrepancies in the tallying of votes.|$|E
